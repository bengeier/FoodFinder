{"text":"Such a cool experience from start to finish. We showed up an hour before our reservations for a pre-dinner drink and loved the dim-lit bar out front -- it's cute, cozy and plays great music. I'd probably go back just for another drink in the charming bar area. But the actual blind dinner was the highlight. The staff is wonderful and makes you feel so comfortable throughout the experience. Our waiter guided us to our table where we spent a few minutes feeling around to get a better idea of our set up and surroundings. We ordered the surprise menu and loved discovering our dishes and trying to pin down exactly what we were eating. Solid beer selection as well. At first, the conversation at our table focused on how interesting the completely new sensation was, but we soon got comfortable enough to almost forget the fact that we couldn't see a thing. Fascinating to hear everyone in our small group's reaction to the whole thing once we were led back out to finish our drinks and pay the bill at the bar. Each of us had a slightly different perspective, but we all agreed that we loved it and would go back for more."}
{"text":"L'une des plus belles expériences culinaires que j'ai eu de ma vie! Le concept est génial. On mange dans un noir complet. Aucune source de lumière à l'intérieur.  Tu choisis le menu à l'avance OU tu prends des surprises. J'ai pris une entrée surprise( excellente) et le lapin ( succulent)! D'accord c'est pas le resto le moins cher de Montréal mais je l'ai vu plus comme une expérience que comme un resto. J'ai était plus qu'agréablement surpris!  Notre serveur Gabriel était super !  Je n'ai absolument aucune remarques négatives à faire et je le recommande grandement !! Merci le onoir !"}
{"text":"Fascinating experience and delicious food. Time flew by during our supper, definitely noticed textures and taste in a different way. Worth it for curious foodies. Our server Lily was kind, professional and answered our many questions."}
{"text":"I highly recommend experiencing this restaurant at least once in your life. The premises, a completely dark restaurant, and i mean completely dark- your eyes will never adjust to the darkness. There are no shadows, no black lights, if you close your eyes, that is exactly what you will see.  Your experience begins in the very well lit bar. Where you peruse a menu and make your meal selection. You can do a two course meal of an app and dinner or a three course meal of app, dinner and desert, at a fixed price. Aside from the menu choices you can choose to be surprised as what you will receive. Not being that adventurous, i only ordered a surprise cocktail.  After you place your order you are introduced to your blind server. you will place your hands on her shoulder and your partner will place their hands on your shoulders. you are taken into a transition room, when the door behind you shuts another door in front of you opens, and you will know this because your server will tell you, not because you see this door, because now EVERYTHING is in darkness.  Your server takes you to your table and places your hand on the chair, she explains everything on the table, the location of your water glass, the contents of the bread plate..while you sit there and take it all in. Trying helplessly to get your eyes to adjust to the darkness, trying to find your fork, listening to other tables drop their utensils on the floor.  Every time the server approaches your table, they announce their arrival, otherwise you would have no idea they were standing there. Our server was amazingly friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. I found the complete darkness to be claustrophobic, and feared my dinner partner had left me every time his side of the table feel silent. If at any point you decide dining in the dark is just too much, you can take your meal in the bar area."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Took a friend of mine there on a date and couldn't have had a better dining experience, added a thrill and dynamic that neither of us knew prior to. Initially, since the room is literally pitch black, I panicked a little but our waiter (Rodrigo) did a great job on making our dinner great. Lastly, the food was incredible. I got the beef shoulder with cheesecake and my friend got the lobster pasta with a chocolate cake, everything was delicious. I HIGHLY suggest it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went all out here (4-courses, alcohol) and paid about 140 after taxes and tip. What I liked about this place was that you could either pick your specific dishes, or do the \"chef's surprise\". I'm somewhat of a picky eater so I was hesitant about the chef's surprise. But I was able to order the surprise while still requesting specific things not to be surprised with. (Eg I'm not a big seafood and shellfish person, so asked that my plates not contain either).   Similarly, as I don't think the goal of the restaurant is to \"trick\" people into eating exotic meats, I believe the main proteins are the standard variety (beef, pork, chicken, duck, shrimp, etc). So where's the surprise? Since you're eating in total darkness, it becomes a very interesting experience to try to figure out what you're eating through taste and texture alone. I found myself forsaking my utensils altogether and eating with my hands. The food was quite delicious -- well worth the price (which is honestly very reasonable for a 4-course meal) and the experience was unparalleled.   Don't worry -- they've thought of it all. You order, use restrooms, lock up belongings in the safety and comfort of regularly-lit rooms before you venture into the black-out dining room.   Obviously not someplace you would want to go if you need to have a serious conversation with someone (it's just too interesting and fun of an experience you'll get sidetracked and/or ruin the experience altogether). It's probably best appreciated by couples, families (with mature children), groups and informal/casual business parties."}
{"text":"A totally unique and very worthwhile experience. It's a little pricey (CA$34 for a two course, or more for 3 course) but very much worth it. You eat in the pitch black! Our waiter, Gabriel, was very helpful and funny. The food was pretty good also - just wear a shirt you don't mind getting a little messy. I ended up eating with only my hands. But nobody knew because it was dark - except for everyone reading this review."}
{"text":"The experience is totally worth it. We got the \"surprise\" menu and I think trying to navigate the dark and not knowing what you're eating enhanced the experience. It was interesting to hear the other patrons around us stumbling through the same issues and thoughts, and it was definitely something we won't forget. Our waiter was awesome and the food was just ok - not as memorable as the experience itself, but again, it's a must go place just for that."}
{"text":"Food excellent, service awesome, atmosphere and place great! I came here for the day before my birthday and it was great. I didn't know what to expect, so didn't have any kind of expectations. I ordered all the surprises menus. I was not at all disappointed with my option of eating something that I didn't have previous knowledge of what it was. The food turned out to be amazing, savory, fresh, and gourmet. The wine pairing was awesome too. Our waiter was very kind and was always alert in case we need something. The experience of eating in the dark it is very interesting and an adventure and experience. It makes you more aware of how someone blind feels,and to be more empathic. In general, I highly recommend this place for the experience and the food. I had the 3 course menu and don't regret at all."}
{"text":"March 4, 2018 Decided to do dinning in the dark for dinner. We had reservations. Walking up to the restaurant we notice two men with  Onoir shirts on smoking outside.... cigarettes and weed. No big deal. Inside the place was cute and clean. We go upstairs to eat. When they tell you it's dark.....it's so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face dark. The waitress was very kind and explained everything. I love the total concept but and here is the rub...... my entree was barely warm when it arrived... further into the dish is actually was cool. By then I was over my food. The flavors were good... we ordered the surprise dinner and we were able to gues what the foods were. But my meal was ruined by a cool/cold entre, so now I'm thinking that there is no chef in the kitchen and that it's the two stoners plating the food. All in All a great idea but if you want a hot entre then this I'm NOT the place to eat."}
{"text":"I tried a dark dinning experience in Berlin many years ago with a different restaurant and had such a great time! So when my fiancé and I were near this place in Montreal, I was excited to share this with him. Well it didn't go as great as I'd hoped.  The good: I made reservations ahead of time, and that was pretty easy. They ask you not bring phones in to dinning area and offer lockers for your bags/coats, which is cool. They were friendly and quick to get us to our table. Service was overall good and we had no complaints.   The bad: We were really let down by the food. I know this is an experience and its more about the experience but c'mon the food should have been better. My fiancé had some duck and it was poorly cooked. It had a very rubbery texture and was unpleasant to eat. Also the chocolate mousse I had for dessert was obviously frozen since when it was served it wasn't completely thawed. And lastly I don't think my fiancé really enjoyed the whole dinning in pitch black experience. With this experience your main focus becomes the food. Tasting, smelling, feeling, and enjoying it, since you can't see it. But when the food doesn't stack up, its just you sitting in the dark chewing on some rubbery overpriced duck and unthawed mousse. Eh, I'd pass on this place again."}
{"text":"C'est trés magnifique!  Flavorful succulent cuisine. Just the right balance of sweet and savory in the shrimp entrée. Good service, trendy atmosphere, and unique concept.  Furniture is a bit uncomfortable, but willing to overlook that for the quality of ingredients and presentation of the meal. Five stars."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant and it doesn't disappoint! Such a fun experience to have with family and friends. I love the fact that majority of the wait staff are legally blind.    First time, about a year agoI came with coworkers and I remember most of us were still hungry by the time we finished. This time around, I went in July and I couldn't even finish my plate! Most said the same. Could be coincidental but it seems they had bigger portions this time around which we appreciated.  If you're in town, I would definitely suggest you try dining in the dark."}
{"text":"This restaurant allows you to experience a meal in absolute and complete darkness. The experience is unlike anything else. The food was fantastic as was the beer. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He explained everything in detail as to help us through the lack of sight. Really enjoyed the food and would definitely go back again. However, this experience is not for those who are claustrophobic as the lack of a sense causes a feeling of being enclosed (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"When we entered they took two tables ordered who arrived after our party. No apology for them either. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. I could have made a better salad at home. There were two pieces of goat cheese in the entire salad ( I know because I cleaned the plate because I was quite hungry after waiting for long to be served). They were out of the red snapper so I order the crab and scallop risotto.  Again I could have made a better dish myself. They used sub par scallops and crab and the risotto was over cooked. There was a bone in my dish which I almost chocked on. I have no idea why there would be a bone in a scallop crab risotto but that was a bad surprise. My date also thought her dishes were sub par. For $120 for two entrees, two mains, a desert and a drink I expect much better quality of food very disappointing."}
{"text":"First, I would recommend this restaurant for the experience alone. Being in a pitch black room, totally devoid of all light, for such an extended period of time is not anything I have ever encountered before. Let alone feeding yourself in the dark. O Noir made a excellent date location, although I'd be reluctant to choose it for a first date (unless you wish to have a literal blind date that could possibly be quite unnerving).  Second, the food was excellent. Of course, without something delicious to devour, the O Noir experience would stand as a piece of theatre without a suitable payoff. O Noir does not disappoint. We enjoyed (and managed to share across the table) three courses that included salmon ceviche, beef tartare, lobster pasta, a surprise main course, chocolate cake, and profiteroles. Every dish impressed.  Third, the staff here were so friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived until after we left all of the staff were very approachable and put up with our many questions. Gracias Alejandro, merci Maurice, and thank you to the others whose names we did not catch."}
{"text":"Ehhh.  I went here solo because someone on Instagram was raving about this place. The food was only ok.  You eat in the dark.  Really nothing to write home about. The waiters are super friendly"}
{"text":"This is the first time for me to dine in with ONOIR, with the completely dark environment. This restaurant serve the prefix menu , 2 courses (no dessert) , and 3 courses (with dessert).  I will give them 5 stars for over all. Food was delicious, service is absolutely more than perfect, AMAZING... Our server is Julee.  I did realize before step in to the main dining room that All servers are blind, but not sure that they are completely blind. She did a great job, she told us everything about how to eat food in the dark environment. I forgot that they will ask you to turn off cell phone , cause they don't want any light in the dining room. You can order all of course of your meal to be the surprise dishes or you can order what you wanna eat from their menu. I did choose my main course to be the surprise dish. All food is so delicious.  Also, at the end of meal, we ordered hot tea and hot coffee. She could brought all hot liquid to the table in dark environment without dropping anything. So, so, so amazing. I totally understand now how these people are in their world without any light.    I really admire the restaurant create and give these people the job to work. At least, they have some money to survive in this real world. I will absolutely go back there if I am in Montreal again.   I love you ONOIR."}
{"text":"Say it with me now.....PITCH BLACK! This place feeds on your excitement and imagination not to mention your pallet. I went to their new location with my GF filled with excitement.  As we got there they explained (in short detail) what was going to happen, and before you go in you order what you will want. My GF took choices off the traditional menu where I went with the 3 course SURPRISE menu and I must say I enjoyed it sooooooooo much.  You are greeted by the waiter , who by the way IS BLIND! That's right , but thank God that his senses are better than ours or else I'd be SOL bumping into tables in pitch black.  It truly is a one of a kind experience. You sitting in the dark hearing laughter throughout the small dining room , not even able to see a glimmer of light anywhere and somehow still eating diner. Keep in mind you can't even see your plate so you never know \"did I eat all of it?\" That's where your hands come into play.  Our waiter was fun, asking me as every dish was completed to guess what I was eating. (Nailed all 3). I recommend getting a but tipsy here as it does amplify the experience.  The food is a but expensive (total bill 119$ Canadian , we did order alot of drinks) but is that really alot for a unforgettable dinner for 2?  I will be recommending this place to any couple or group of friends who want a fun and memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was everything I wanted and more. There's a bar area to have a drink and place your order while the host explains the process. Once the table is ready, your blind waiter leads you into total darkness and guess you to the table while he describes the layout of the table so you don't spill anything.   I ordered a surprise appetizer (dairy free) and a shrimp dish with a citrus dipping sauce for an entree. Gabriel wouldn't tell me anything about the dish until I finished and told him what I thought it was. In total darkness the eyes cannot relay a message to the brain ant what's being eaten and the palate is more awake. I tasted arugula, citrus vinaigrette, and what I thought was mushrooms but actually scallops!  Eating in darkness is a wonderful experience. Despite not making eye contact,  conversation was flowing because there was nothing to distract us. The tea at the end was a great finish to the meal. I dont visit Canada often but I highly recommend this unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Best fucking place ever! Went last night at the suggestion of my air bnb host and honestly say can't find anywhere like this in the States! You are literally in a pitch black fucking room and once you get passed the shock of trying to find where you put your fork and figuring out where everything is on the table, your senses heighten and the games begin! Figuring out what your eating is so much fun and if you have amazing wait staff like Rodrigo and Lilly you'll be sure to have an amazing time. Shoutout to Rodrigo and Lilly for being amazing servers and for the great conversation . Cannot rave enough! Also as a note if you go do all surprises ; you're fucking in the dark so enjoy the experience and have some mystery!"}
{"text":"Visiting this restaurant was on top of our to do list during our first visit to Montreal and it was as awesome as we thought it would be.  Experience: You get to order outside of the dark room. Once your table is ready you make a line holding your waiter's shoulders and go through double doors to get to the dark room. The darkness is really impressive and disorienting. I was expecting enough light so I could see my hands in front of my face but I only knew they were there because they are attached to my body.   While we were waiting for our food we were strategizing on how to use utensils and how not to make a mess (we were both wearing white lol). You have nothing else to do but to think about stuff you never think about in a normal restaurant, \"how big is our table, how do the chairs look/feel like, what do the people next me look like, do they have decorations on the walls, how big is this place, can we start a food fight, is my waiter wearing pants, etc...\"  Food: It was better than I expected. I got the ribs because I figured it would be easy finger food and my wife got filet because it would be easy to cut and we were both right. They were both perfectly cooked and the ribs were not the messy extra-sauce-dripping-everywhere type of ribs, which was nice in this environment.  Overall: Awesome experience and it's worth trying at least once. It's a good place to eat in general but for us it was mostly about the experience. We speculate that it would be great for blind dates and maybe they should partner up with a dating sites.   Note that if you don't speak French you are basically losing another sense because you have no idea what's going on around you.. (Staff speaks English)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place everyone should try at least once. The meal is served in a predetermined 5 course meal, but you can choose a vegan option. They start off by serving you champagne then they walk you into the dining area which is completely black, there's no light whatsoever. I really enjoyed my experience overall. My only complaint would be that the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try dark dining for a VERY long time so my expectations were running high.  We don't have a regular dark dining place in Calgary and when I hear about the special events they are sold out or don't work for my life.    I went with 3 vegetarian surprise courses because that's just how I roll.  Hubs did the 3 courses of whatever you got.  I learned that the chef used to work in a vegetarian restaurant which is an extra bonus because sometimes good vegetarian food is harder to execute than animal protein. Not to set off any of the carnivores... hubs was equally enamored with his meat.  Everything was quite good.  I was surpassed how accurate I was about the ingredients - may of which I don't use often and some of which I down right don't eat but really don't dislike (it's childhood trauma?).  I don't want to discuss what those are so I don't ruin anyone else's surprise but I think my momma would be surprised a certain vegetable was cleaned off my plate (I was tricked a first and then I decided I liked it enough to keep eating ). The chef was really playing with temperatures, textures, tastes and everything else to help enhance the experience of missing sight.   My husband was comically wrong... he got his protein as wrong as I think one could even manage as I don't think those particular animals taste anything alike.   I like competition and I totally won at surprise meals while blind.  Woot!  I enjoyed picking surprises because I might not have normally chosen them... I didn't like everything but it was really really fun to guess what I was tasting.  ONoir was a bit different than another large chain I'm aware of because we got our own table so it really was a romantic dinner for two and not sitting around at a large table with other strangers we can't see.  It was a bit louder at times but really it was a slower Monday night and there were only a couple of others in the room.      Our server was great,  Rodrigo, and it was an honor to spend a couple hours with him.  He shared that he had lost his sight vs having adapted without it and I felt like I could much better understand his experience meeting him in his world.  At moments there was a lot of anxiety about how I'd butter my bread or find my cocktail... trivial things to my every day life and even to the other challenges blind people do through on a regular basis and it made me think.  It gave me a deeper respect and understanding for blind people and also the confidence that I could deal with a major life change like blindness if it were to happen to me too.   I think it would have cheapened the experience to have servers in night vision as  It was nice that he was there helping us orient to our tables, chairs, food and place settings. Real tricks used in everyday life for someone without sight and I'm pleasantly surprised how well I adapted. ( bonus tip:  I had to put everything back where it came from and memorize the place setting ... hubs was very random and never got the hang of the table and was always losing things or knocking a fork off the table he didn't realize was there) It takes a bit of extra server involvement to dine in the dark so it also helped that Rodrigo was just an all round great dude as he was a big part of our dinner.  Not an inexpensive meal (I think we came in at about $100 for the pair), but it stands the chance of staying with me a lot longer than most good meals if that makes any sense.  Also,  I'd consider it along the lines of dinner and a show almost...  because there is definitely the experience aspect to work into the value of the night.  Overall it's pretty awesome and I'd try it again when I'm back in Montreal or try another one of the styles of dark dining that are around in other cities no problem.  If you are at all inclined to give it shot I would highly recommend trying it.  I know there was another lady in the room that was almost losing it in the begining  (I've quite proud she found the courage to stay whomever that lady was..)  so I guess this isn't for everyone.  I definitely won't plan it as a surprise  without knowing it would be well received to say the least."}
{"text":"This place should have well over five stars for the experience of it all, but I'll tell you why I only gave four. The people were amazing and the whole experience was something that you should 100% experience in your lifetime. The waiter was so kind and went above and beyond to make our experience the best it could be. The hostess was sure to answer any and all of our questions happily, even though we asked about a million and chatted for over five minutes.   The reason I did not give full stars is because the food is mediocre. I would definitely over and over again recommend this restaurant for the experience of it all, but we were not a big fan of the food. We called and they honored our Groupon which included an app, 2 entrees and 2 drinks for a dinner for two.    Like I said, the experience was unforgettable and super amazing but the food was okay."}
{"text":"We we're nervous about the experience, however our server, Sammy made it great. Food was good, dessert (chocolate mousse) a little too bitter or something. The straining of my eyes to see was a little difficult to get used to however it was a unique dining experience with extremely friendly and comforting service. Thanks Sammy!!!"}
{"text":"This review is written with the presumption you know what this place is about: eating food in a pitch black room.   Food: 4/5 stars. We choose the 3 course surprise-me option. My partner and I both thought our appetizer was turkey, when it was in fact revealed to be duck. This was due to the fact that the duck was fairly dry relative to the fatty duck we have had in the past. My partner also aptly noted that the appetizer would have been excellent by any standards had it actually been turkey---it's hard to get turkey to be that moist. The main course was slightly salty, but delicious. We forgot to ask what dessert was, but it tasted somewhat like an apple cobbler.  Service: 5/5 We accidentally arrived there early, but were welcomed with warm and exceptional service. I'd give this place a 6/5 had it not been for the fact we felt kind of forgotten after we were served dessert. We spent approximately half an hour or so in the dark after eating everything, trying to get a waiter to lead us back out.   Atmosphere/Experience: 6/5 There is most definitely an entertainment factor that leads to this high-rating. You're lead into a pitch black room by holding a waiter's shoulder, with any others in your party possibly holding onto your own shoulders. It's silly, it's exciting, and should you choose to let the restauraunt pick your meals (which I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend for obvious reasons), everything is a delightful and savory/sweet surprise.   As we were the first ones to enter, we experienced an eerie quietness with some simple music in the room, getting used to drinking/using utensils without sight. As more people were brought in, we could hear their excitement and the energy was somewhat infectious. The lack of sight is actually an excellent dinner topic, so bring your friends! Maybe you'll be as pleased by the food as we were too!"}
{"text":"Onoir is definitely a great experience to try at least once in a lifetime!!! I had a particular experience today, a wine tasting conpletely in the dark!! Sammy, the waiter was very friendly and useful to bring us to our seats. It's kind of scary at first but it's impressive how you get used to darkness and actually find your way with no sight at all. We did not have the actual menu but instead some tapas-styled bites after the tasting. The were all very tasty, different and paired well with the wine. Congrats to allessandro, the owner, and all the team. This seems to be a challenge both for the customers and the staff. I'll go back to try the whole dining experience soon."}
{"text":"A truly one of a kind experience! You dine in complete darkness, and they really go out of the way to make the experience unique. Our server joked with us but also checked in the whole time to make sure we were comfortable. The sensory deprivation accentuates the taste of the food, which is already delicious- we especially enjoyed the surprise courses, where you had to guess based on taste what the food was. Overall, amazing service of great food and an experience you won't get anywhere else!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!   You first step in to the restaurant where you view the menu and make your selections. You can either have a two course or three course meal. We decided on the entree, dessert and a drink. *There is an option to have a \"surprise\"dish instead of selecting it yourself. I would HIGHLY recommend this* We allowed our entree to be a surprise but chose our dessert and drink. You put away your belongings in a locker. You can not bring any light in!   You are then led in by your server into COMPLETE blackness. I have to admit, I have moderate claustrophobia and recurrent nightmares of being in enclosed spaces so I had a minor bout with anxiety initially. I wasn't sure I was going to make it! But you get use to it, and you start using your other senses.   Our surprise main dish was pork, turnip and tomato. It was AMAZING. It was also an incredible experience learning what it was we were eating as we picked it up, tasted it, felt it. (It wasn't until after that we were told what it was). The pork was so tender. For dessert we had the creme brûlée which was also delicious. We tried the Sangria and it was very different. It was ok but almost tasted watery to me. I would stick with a wine next time.   Our server Julia (I think) was amazing and so friendly. It was sad when the experience was over! Would highly recommend and would definitely come again.   Also, to the guy who spilt his beer all over himself from over yonder-- thanks for the comic relief haha!"}
{"text":"This was literally the best meal of my life!!! My boyfriend and I wanted to go to a different French restaurant nearby, but it was full. We walked by this place and walked in here for an casual dinner. After the waiter told us that this is the dark restaurant, we were skeptical at first but decided to give it a try.  We picked the pork croquette and salmon gravlax for starter, fish of the Day and shrimps for main courses and surprise dessert.  The complete darkness made our dinner absolutely amazing! Our taste bud was 100% more sensitive and exploring what's on your plate was such a special feeling. (We were using our hands to eat since no one can see us, which was something you can never do anywhere else, it was soooo fun!) This was the perfect place for a romantic dinner also! Magical would be the word to describe this experience. There were no disturbing background music, which I really love. You can really talk to each other and relax without worrying about other people looking at you.   This was such a good dinner and I would recommend it to any couple! This would NOT be a good place to have dinner with your friends, but perfect for couples!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this restaurant. I had the surprise main paired with surprise wine. Gab was our waiter and did a fantastic job. My husband loved his main course so much that he considered ordering an additional plate instead of dessert."}
{"text":"Let me just say this: We went here on our first night in Montreal and had NO IDEA we'd be eating in the dark. We were SO SO SO CONFUSED.  Whatever, we had the reservation so we went with it. Got some surprise foods. The waiters do a very good job of guiding you through the meal. However, I started to get anxious once the entree portion was over and was very restless to get out of there.  The food is good but I was so focused on not getting it all over myself that I couldn't really enjoy it.  If you're looking for a food experience.. this is definitely the place to get it. I never realized how important it was to SEE what I was eating until this place!"}
{"text":"I tell everyone about this place. Not only was the food amazing, but the experience was like nothing else. I really really enjoyed this. Go with a small group and you will not be disappointed. We will be coming back to Montreal this weekend and will definitely be stopping in here!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Amazing culinary experience.  O'Noire is no gimmick. The food is delicious and thoughtfully executed.  We got the tenth anniversary Groupon which gave us a cocktail, appetiser, and entree. When you enter you are greeted and directed to lockers where you can keep your bags. Having bags on the floor in the dining area would be a safety hazard. You are then shown the menu where you can choose from the items listed or be surprised. I chose the surprise cocktail and appetiser but got the rabbit saddle stuffed with poultry and wrapped in bacon for the main. My friend went full surprise mode.  We were then escorted into the dining area by our server. We created a train as we entered into pure darkness, which was definitely a shock to the system. You literally cannot even see the outline of you hand I. After we were seated, we were treated to bread and butter.   Our cocktails arrived and I received a grapefruit, gin, and soda cocktail that was delicious and complemented my meal.  Our surprise appetisers arrived, and we both guessed wrong. What I thought was a juicy, succulent braised beef dish was actually duck confit. My friend thought she had fresh salmon tartare, but it was actually scallop. Whatever they were, we devoured them with gusto.  My main was just as delicious, but it was a shock. The three types of meat mixed together created a new flavour and texture that was unlike anything I had before. And I loved whenever I found a piece of artichoke heart and roasted cherry tomato. My friend thought her main was braised beef cheek with Jerusalem artichoke puree, roasted squash, and sweet potato chips. In the end, it was braised lamb with squash done three ways.   We ended the meal with coffee and tea. My chai smelled outstanding, almost vibrant, and the flavours danced on my tongue.  Because we couldn't see, the server would carefully place anything he was handing us on our shoulder, and we would take it from him and place it down. He was a sweetheart who would frequently check on us. The darkness did take some time getting used to, but it was such a wonderful experience that I will most likely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Exciting experience and the food I ordered was exceptional. My gf's wasn't to her style. Also we had a server change mid meal. I don't know how that even happened it was pitch black in there but there was a lot of chatter and stimulated your other senses aside from your eyesight of course."}
{"text":"Fun family meal with the foodie family which included my hubby and two young adult children. The staff is friendly and do a great job of orienting you to the process. Our waitress Lily was attentive, delightful and charming. 3/4 of us went with the \"Surprise\" 3 course meal. I started with the crab salad and then went \"blind\" from there for the two remaining courses. The \"Surprise\" courses are not on the menu, so you don't need to worry about getting something on the menu that is slow selling. Lily was very conscientious in acknowledging our food allergies at our table. The food was tasty ( slightly too salty for my taste), but it was entertaining as well as challenging to share bites of food and drinks with your table mates as we like to share. The mixed drinks and wine were tasty and not over priced. Some unique combinations of food that keeps you guessing. Definitely worth trying if you like adventurous eating and a unique dining experience. We would definitely do it again! The experience 5 stars, food 4 stars, service 5 star."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute MUST if you're in Montreal. My husband went with surprise dishes and was not disappointed. I chose my dishes ahead of time but I was still in for plenty of surprises! This is an incredible experience, and the food is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here! Really makes you appreciate your sense of sight. The waiters are all very friendly and made us feel comfortable in an uncomfortable setting. I ordered off the menu, while my boyfriend did the surprise for all three courses. The waiter asked him to guess what he ate, and he didnt get a single thing right!  Would definitely recommend this restaurant if in Montreal."}
{"text":"It was our first time to try a dark dining restaurant. We had an amazing experience. All of the staff are friendly, and want you to enjoy to the fullest. There are lockers with a key that you can store your stuff in for free. We got a very nice waiter. His name is Rodrigo, if you go, I would recommend you ask for him.  After he got to know us a bit, he made some funny comments about eating in complete darkness.  The food is delicious. I asked for a surprise entree and main. You really have to feel , smell, and taste your food alot :) In the end we must have looked like cavemen eating, but who cares, no one can see! We would go again for sure!  Be aware that one of their dishes is tartar (raw beef)."}
{"text":"I just went there for the experience and as I imagined, we had a blast. I can't enjoy my meal if I don't share it with my friends so I ended up picking my food with my hands (I gave up on the fork) and give it to my friends. It was hilarious. The only downside was that the meal itself isn't really special but I still highly recommend the place for the experience, and also because you're supporting visually impaired workers. :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend a meal at O'Noir!  The experience starts off in the small bar when you walk into the restaurant.  That's where you look over the menu, place your order and they answer any questions you may have.  They also have you out your jackets and anything that may create light (cell phone, watch, etc) into a locker.   From there you line up outside the door to enter a 'mid' room.  You put your arms on the shoulder of the person in front of you and walk in a line into the mid room (the mid room is there to ensure no light enters the main dining room).  Once everyone is in the mid room and it's dark the server takes you into the main dining room and guides you to your seat.    The food itself is excellent.  You have a choice of two items (appetizer, main or desert) for $36 or all three for $42.  All of the food everyone had at our table was excellent.    Highly recommend a visit and will return!"}
{"text":"The experience is as everyone else has said - you're eating in pitch black. A blind waiter leads you into the room and to your seat (double doors to keep out the light) by asking you to hold onto his shoulders. He asks you to put your drink close to the wall, which we supposed, was a method of minimizing spills. Only the two maison drinks (Mai Mai and Raspberry Dream) are part of the groupon. Anything else, you pay extra.  Food-wise: The appetizer I ordered was amazing (Pork croquettes and pan-fried scallop - yeup, just one scallop). The entrees (Lobster Pasta) was alright - but I wouldn't go beyond that. I was initially afraid that the lobster meat amount would be small, but what ended up being the cause of disappointment was the pasta itself. The pasta was over-done, too soft, and semi-mushy. Were it not for the big lobster chunks, there would be no saving this dish.  Any disappointment with the food, however, is never the focus of your attention because you're so concentrated on not dropping the fork and knife that's in your hand. I had my palms 1cm in front of my eyes and I seriously could not see anything.  I went in with a groupon and still felt that the meal was pricey. Granted, there was a \"+4\" beside the Lobster Pasta option, but it would've been nice had the hostess confirmed that $4 would be added to the total surcharge for ordering the Lobster Pasta over the other entrees. Sometimes it's not clear whether the menu used for groupon users is different from the restaurant's regular menu? After the surcharges and tips, the two of us paid an additional $20 on top of the $55 groupon.  Conclusion: You go for the experience, not necessarily for the food. But seriously, great experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the two course surprise. The food was very good BUT before I entered the dark I requested that I had no red meat and then said \"so no pork or cow\". The waitress nodded her head and wrote this down. After my meal we were told what we ate, and in the second course I was served pork with bacon bits in the dish as well. I asked her about this and she told me she wrote down \"no red meat\". And I said yes but I received pork is there any way I can get a discount, expecting her to take it off the bill (I do not eat it for ethical reasons and I get a stomach ache when I eat it). She then proceeded to tell me she didn't hear me specify no pork, even though both my friends heard me. She also went on to say that pork is technically a white meat. I googled it and I was correct in that pork is considered red meat, but didn't say so because I didn't want to cause a scene. It was obvious she did not want to take the dish off my bill, even though it was pricey and in my opinion she should've taken it off.    We waited a long time after we finished eating to be escorted out. We were in the restaurant a total of two hours. Besides this, very interesting and good experience."}
{"text":"After having been to the one in Toronto, I was really impressed with the organization and menu at the Montreal one. They have a greater selection of menu items (more french-cuisine selections). It's definitely a unique experience that requires you to use all your senses except for sight, of course. Obviously, if you're someone who is anal about your food at restaurants and examines it before you eat and makes sure your meat is cooked the way you like it, etc., etc., And if you're someone who is claustrophobic and/or have anxiety about the unknown, then this type of setting would not be for you. I knocked a star because it is very expensive, dinner for 2 people can easily be around $90-150."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night after flying in for business. Was not able to get seats in the Dark seating but was able to order in the bar. All of the food was Aweosme! I had the Croqutee app. Lobster pasta and cheese cake for my 3 courses. Can't wait to come back and do the surprise menu in the dark room"}
{"text":"I went with a meal for two Groupon and it was quite an amazing experience. You select what you wanna eat before hand (or to be surprised) and then a blind server will guide you to your seat in the darkness.   I had the Mai Mai cocktail which was pretty great, but what's even better is the tea beer. Wow! I wanna buy a 12-pack. My appetizer was the pork with scallop mousse, and this mousse must have been the highlight of the night. Packed with flavour and a nice velvety texture, enhanced by the fact I couldn't see it! I had the rabbit as a main course (yes, I wasn't adventurous until dessert time, how boring). The seasoning had maybe a tad more rosemary than it needed, but all-around well balanced with the apricots and full of different textures. Eating it with cutlery was difficult though, maybe practice before hand?   I chose to be surprised in the dessert because I figured I should have the experience of not knowing what I was being served too, so I feel that was a pretty safe bet (feel free to copy me). We got an amazing creamy dessert with blueberries and toasted quinua. Usually I hate when restaurants use quinua because they don't really cook it to its best potential (I'm Peruvian so I know I thing or two about that!) but in this case... I must say I'm impressed. Waiter was also so nice!!   The only bad thing is that some people, when they have been deprived of one sense, in this case sight, start talking really loudly to, I guess, overcompensate, and there was this table far from us that was screaming so much that I had a hard time chatting with the person who was right in front of me. But that's not a criticism on the restaurant, rather a recommendation for customers to be mindful of that and try to respect everyone's culinary experience!"}
{"text":"We went to O Noir as a family for the unique experience we hoped it would offer. It did not disappoint! It is so much darker than I expected it to be, almost too dark. Definitely not a good idea for anyone who is anxious or claustrophobic, however, I found it to be a really eye-opening (ha ha) experience and really allows you to imagine how difficult living with limited vision is.   I had the beef tartare to start and the pork duology with apple and maple syrup as the main. The pork was amazing, the beef tartare was very different than what I was used to but still good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must if you visit Montreal. Dining in complete darkness was something I was hesitate about but I must say, I really enjoyed it. The food was amazing as well as the service. You can order off the menu or have a surprise appetizer and main course. You can let them know food preferences and allergies before dining. What are you waiting for??? Go... Go now!!!"}
{"text":"Ma copine m'avait réservé la surprise de m'inviter dans ce restaurant, un peu spécial. Un bon concept oui, une expérience unique à vivre une fois dans sa vie, je pense, soit manger dans le noir pour vraiment savourer & goûter différemment sans la vue, justement servis par des gens avec une déficience visuelle. Jeudi soir, beaucoup de monde attendait comme nous avant d'entrer dans le fameux local noir. On vous propose le menu avec ses entrées / plats principaux / desserts ou sinon le menu surprise. Le serveur nous dit de le suivre pour nous amener à notre table et voilà, l'obscurité totale! Vraiment bizarre comme sensation, on écoute toutes les conversations dans le noir autour de nous. Le serveur nous amène l'entrée pour moi (croquettes de porc/sauce fruits de mer), bof! Le plat principal pour moi (magret de canard), bof! Le serveur a été très professionnel & gentil avec nous du début à la fin. Conclusion, j'aurai vraiment voulu aimé ce restaurant, mais moi, personnellement, je savoure avec mes yeux lorsque je mange et malheureusement, je suis resté perplexe. Ma copine était du même avis que moi. On mange avec les yeux en premier avant notre estomac. Sinon, le concept va peut être plaire à des gens, je vous suggère d'essayer pour voir. Au niveau prix, je ne peux pas parler car c'était une invitation de la part de ma copine. À savoir, pour les gens claustrophobiques, s'abstenir, ça peut faire peur de rester 1h dans le noir total sans contact visuel.  3/5 visité en mars 2018"}
{"text":"Went to ONoir on a friend's recommendation and although I knew that it was about dining in the dark, I don't think I could have ever imagined for the intense experience that it was. You don't see a thing for the entirety of your meal and but that really adds to the dining experience as I believe your sense of taste and smell gets heightened. Both my wife and I are vegetarians, she got the stuffed cabbage and I got the surprise mains and we both got the mousse for dessert. I really liked my surprise main course and it was fun trying to guess what I was eating. I also got a surprise tea which was one of the best teas I have had.   Also, big thanks to our server Gabriel who really helped us with our experience. I have really high respect for these guys and what they are able to achieve here !! Overall awesome experience and hope to come back here sometime"}
{"text":"Eating at O'Noir was such a fun dining experience! My brother and I took our parents there as a Christmas gift and we all loved it! None of us had ever been to a restaurant like O'Noir before and have all recommended it to several people since we ate there. It was very enjoyable to go out for dinner and have a unique experience versus the usual restaurant outing. It was fun to have to adapt to not being able to see. Our server, Sam, was very sweet and helpful.  And aside from the obvious pitch black aspect of the restaurant, the food was exceptional! I had red snapper and profiteroles and both were phenomenal. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We had fun choosing between the dishes or a surprise dish! It was also super interesting to be brought into an ENTIRELY pitch black room to eat. I neverrrr expected it to be as dark as it was! However, after we were seated and bread came .. we waited for quite a while for our appetizers. They were reasonably well cooked and tastes pretty good ! I had the pork croquettes and they were very rich, but somewhat overpowered by the seafood lemon that came from the scallops next to it.  My main course was supposed to be duck, but most pieces were fat and tasted more like dried pork. My sister ordered the salmon, and really liked it. We are familiar with the Caps Cod fish, but she said this dish may be too \"seafoodish\" for some. Still somewhat enjoyable. I had been confused because the duck didn't taste at all like what we expected.  Unfortunately that was where it ended... by choice. We waited for over a half hour for our waiter... who never came. We ordered a bottle of wine and had only a 1/2 glass before our meal and one whole glass with our appetizer. Last time we checled, a bottleee served more than 3 8oz glasses.. We waited so long that we had yo cut our 3 course meal to a 2 course mean and ditched the rest of our bottle unfortunately. Overall - fun to experience! but not worth the money"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely gives diners a unique experience which allows them to better understand what it is like for a blind person.   When you arrive, you will put your belongings in a locker and use the restroom if needed. Then they will have you look at a menu and preorder. After that, you will meet your waiter or waitress for the night, who are blind themselves. That is when you will form a train and enter the dark room to be escorted to your seats. It is no lie, PITCH BLACK, you will not see a thing. You will only hear the noises of the other diners enjoying their meals. If you need anything during dinner you just call your waiter's name and they will stop by. After you eat, you will be escorted back into the light where you will pay your bill.   I started with the pork croquettes appetizer, this appetizer wasn't for me because it Tasted too much like mustard with tons of breading but I may be just picky. For my meal I had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Overall I thought the portions and flavors were great. The mashed potatoes were a puree so they were on the creamier side. The meat was perfectly cooked, not too fatty, and cut up for me. To drink I had a raspberry vodka cocktail which was fantastic, I would definitely recommend! It didn't taste overally sweet or strong. Bread and tea also comes with most of their meals. My mother had the ribs which personally I think is a bad idea given how messy Ribs are.  For dessert we shared the PROFITEROLES WITH HOMEMADE NOUGAT ICE-CREAM. It tasted good but overall it was a small dessert with very little ice cream And at that point I was ready to go back into the light.  Our waiter Rodrigo was very friendly and funny!   I'm giving 5 stars because of the unique experience done well as a whole."}
{"text":"If you can get here, I suggest you go!  It took me a couple tries to get in, but was able to work up the nerve to do it.   You will not be sorry!!  The staff is amazing!  Very kind, courteous and friendly.  The food was very good, tasty and served graciously.    I would do this again for the food and experience!!! Kudos to my waiter Sam!!!!!  He was so kind and respectful.  The bar staff.... Superb!!!!"}
{"text":"Update:  I just wanted to say that months later, I still find myself talking about how interesting and fun our meal here was.  It's really not to be missed!  I can't wait to come back again- and we live four hours away!  We will definitely make it happen."}
{"text":"I came wondering if the hype about eating in the dark was real. When I see a restaurant get 5 star reviews I'm often disappointed, this was one of the few times I was not. I came here with a group of friends to try this pitch black eating experience and it was great. I took the surprise starter and the surprise main. Not knowing at all what I was eating made it the whole experience more interesting, they both were great meals. (I won't tell you what it was) The only complaint I have is my main course, I felt it was too small but that might be because I have a big appetite. Try O Noir at least one time in your life, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you're in for adventurous dining, I O'Noir is the place for you! The premise is simple enough: dining in the dark. And by dark I mean utter, complete, can't-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. The sensory deprivation can be upsetting for some, but once you get used to it, the experience is truly fascinating! The front area of the restaurant is lit, and is where you place your orders. You're led back to the dark dining area by the wait staff, who explains how the process works.   We opted for the three-course menu (appetizer, entree, dessert), which was tasty and well-priced. Our waiter was friendly as was the host in the front area.   I would have given 5 stars, but they switched our appetizers, and we obviously didn't figure it out until after we started eating. The darkness made plate switching tricky...The dark dining room was also uncomfortably warm at the start of our meal, but it seemed to cool down eventually.  Immediately after our meal my mindset was \"ok once, but probably never again\", but as I tell friends and family about our experience, I would do this again, especially now that I know what it will be like!"}
{"text":"Ca fait La deuxième fois que je vais au restaurant Onoir en 2 mois jai jamais était déçus La nourritures et très bonne et service et aussi très bon dire que les serveurs sont non voyant 10/10   Jai manger une à -Entrée de tartare du moment (boeuf) -Plat surprise qui était effiloché d'agneau purée courge patate douce  -Dessert profiterole au nougat glacée sauce caramel et confiture de fraise   Je vais y retourne ses très sur :)"}
