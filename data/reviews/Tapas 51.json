{"text":"This place was amazing! The decor, food, and cocktails truly encompass the tapas vibe! The patio is the perfect place to enjoy a cold festive drink, on a hot summer night!  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They are passionate about preparing good food with exquisite tastes. I joked with the chef/owner, who by the way comes out personally to ask how it was, that I wouldn't post anything about them because it will become harder to get a table."}
{"text":"I stopped by for an early lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The server (Taylor) was excellent and had personality plus!  Aaron (owner) was very gracious and came over to talk with me.  The menu is not large but varied, and I am already looking forward to trying the chorizo sliders next time.  I am not a big eater and feel that I waste a lot of food when dining out.  Tapas portions are just perfect.  I had the brussel sprouts with caramelized onions and chorizo.  Not only were they delicious, perfect in size, but also very reasonably priced.  Be sure to try the sangria....very refreshing!"}
{"text":"I normally don't like Tacos, and have never tried a popusa, but let me tell you this place is AMAZING! Wow, there food is so good. They modernized a plain taco & popusa with flavor that just works! They also have a school bus called, The Chrome Toaster, which is available for parties. Love this place.."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a restaurant like this in Charlotte for the past two years!! I am so grateful this chef/owner landed up here. We have had the pleasure of dining in some of the best and most flavorful restaurants all over the US and the world, but Tapas 51 rivals and, I would argue, surpasses most all of them in terms of flavor, freshness, and atmosphere. First, the flavor - we got the shrimp papusa, chorizo sliders, bok bok chicken, street corn, and beet empanadas. Everything was out of this world good! The flavors are extremely complex and well-balanced. The food is very fresh and healthy. Lastly, the atmosphere is casual, laid-back, and very, very friendly. Every person we interacted with - from the hostess to the waitress to the chef himself - were beyond pleasant and wonderful to chat with. We felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with Tapas 51. The lighting was extremely bright, reminding me of the interrogation rooms on tv. The chili coffee crusted brisket tacos were just okay with little flavor. We had to spit out several fatty and gristly pieces. The grilled shrimp pupusa was delicious with multiple flavors and textures. The chorizo brussel sprouts were good but nothing to write home about. The Colombian chorizo sliders were pretty good. I was extremely disappointed with our waitress as she was lacking in personality, never cracked a smile, and never said you're welcome when thanked for bringing out items. We waited entirely too long for her to run our credit card considering the lack of other customers. We never got a visit from the manager or chef even though the chef could be seen outside the kitchen a couple of times. If the customer service were better it would certainly have improved our experience."}
{"text":"After you accept the concept of tapas - which was new to me, this is a nice place to come and have a great time and enjoy good food.  To extend the evening, think about ordering a small plate per person....drink some wine and then order another round of food....or two.  If you don't, your evening might be over before you are ready!  Unfortunately, the taco special was no longer available by the time we got there - but the brisket taco was a more than adequate substitute.  Our table of two ended up ordering 4 small plates and we enjoyed them all.  In addition, our waitress was A+.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fabulous combination of flavors and textures. We have been looking for something unique and fresh.  As there aren't many good tapas in the area. We enjoyed 8 of the menu items and none disappointed. Chorizo sliders.. Very flavorful.  Brightened up interior and great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My (adult) son and I went for my birthday with a hankering for good Latin American food, which we know well. This place far exceeded our already high expectations. Chef Aaron's inventiveness and artistry, and his love of good flavors, above all, are impeccable. The service was awesome- friendly and personable, with on-point recommendations. We worked our way through much of the menu, wanting always to try more delicious tapas. The shrimp pupusas and the butternut squash gnocchi would not have been our top choices going in, but we learned to trust every recommendation. They turned out to be ridiculously good and highlights of the evening. I cannot wait to go back. This is as good as anything I have had throughout this country and beyond. What a deal to have Chef Aaron and his staff and kitchen so close by. Â¡Gracias chef!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic...great mix of flavors and dishes.   Food is always artfully displayed which adds to the joy of eating it.   The service is always wonderful and staff is knowledgeable of the dishes they offer.  I do wish they would improve the atmosphere as the layout is just awkward and uninviting.  I would give 4 stars for the food but the space itself lowers it to a 3."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Papusa is probably the best thing I've eaten in a long time. Everything was so delicious, innovative and flavorful. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. We only ordered 2 dishes , the coffee crusted brisket tacos and chorizo brussels sprouts. The flavors were amazing in both dishes. Sangria was good, too! The restaurant was easy to find and the waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Ambience is nice, food awesome and service very good. Unique menu too!!"}
{"text":"We live in Fort Mill and we are always looking for a non-chain restaurant to try. Sadly, most seem to be of the \"country kitchen\" variety, and we don't eat fried foods. I stumbled on Tapas 51 on the way to Carolina Place Mall--I saw the sign, and we decided to try it. The location is small but not too intimate--we didn't feel cramped and it was clean and fresh-looking inside. Our server (I think his name was Matt) was awesome--we had lots of questions, and he answered them all enthusiastically and made knowledgeable recommendations. The shrimp papusa--well, there aren't words. It was incredible--rich, creamy, full of flavor. My husband and I shared one and then had to order another. The squash gratin was lovely--very crisp zucchini and yellow squash in a light sauce and the herbs were perfect. We had the fish taco of the day, and the grouper was cooked perfectly. Try the brussel sprouts with chorizo--great finish from the spicy sausage. I wish we had tried more options, but we'll definitely be back! The dessert was big enough to share--just enough of a taste after the flavorful dishes. I hope this restaurant is a hit and stays around and that once it gets popular, we'll still be able to get a table!"}
{"text":"Arron, the owner and entire team are wonderful.  It's like Cheers where everyone knows your name.  The service is great, they all know good food and drinks, and the food is some of the best in CLT.  It's the best Tapas spot between here and Asheville.    We will be back next wk"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a couple margaritas and some corn tamales from this hidden gem!, Small venue high end establishment!  Was presented with a delicious plate and impressed with the level of service for the price!  Woulda ordered a main course but the boss didn't cover my bill so I'll have to come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaawesooooooooooooome!  The freshness and care of the food preparation makes this a must.  It's just off of 77 and 485, so easy to get to for a large area.  Make sure you get the pot brownie!"}
{"text":"Food was good but we paid a lot and we're still hungry after, i am familiar with tapas portions but these were absolutely ridiculous, unfortunately wouldn't go back price was to high for what you get."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and mojitos/strawberry habanero Rita were great too. It was a little of a drive for us but well worth it. We got to try a few different dishes but our favorite was chili coffee crusted brisket tacos."}
{"text":"Yummy tapas! We had the grouper cakes, brisket empanadas, street corn and chorizo brussel sprouts. All were delicious! We also had the peanut butter churros for dessert and those were ah-mazing. We can't wait to come back to try the other tapas on the menu. And we'll come back on a Thursday for the awesome $5 sangria special."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant does not justify the prices on the menu. They are located in a low rent suburban area.  The acoustic on the main room is very bad. It's very hard to carry a conversation if you sit in the middle of the room. On the bright side, the quality of the food is  4 stars. The grilled shrimp pupusa is my favorite. Our family ordered a second serving. Chili coffe crusted brisket was tasty and the empanadas has a nice aioli sauce. Bokbok chicken can use a little more flavor. The grouper chevice and churrasco are average."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of the food truck, Chrome Toaster. Thus, after finding out that Chef Aaron opened up a restuarant in Fort Mill (where the old Passion 8 used to be), we had to go check it out!!  We came here this past Friday evening around 8:30pm or so. The place was busy but we were seated immediately. Inside there are a good amount of tables, a large bar with numerous bar stools, and a side room with a large table that can be rented out for family events or to just casually sit at (I have a large Italian family that HAVE to sit at the same table, so I can totally appreciate this room with a huge table in it!!!). There is also an outside patio with numerous tables and lighting. The place is decorated, for lack of a better word, very cute!  My husband ordered the Duck Rabbit Stout (the local beer selection was excellent!!!) and I got the Habanero Strawberry Marg. The margarita was absolutely delish and a perfect mix of spicy and sweet!  We ordered four different things on the menu to share....since it is a tapas style restuarant. They came out at different times but there was never a long wait in between, which was perfect!! We got the shrimp pupusa (anyone that knows me knows I LOVE pupusas!!), brussel sprouts, tamale special of the day, and the duck confit tacos special of the day. The shrimp pupusa was definitely the highlight....so many awesome flavors and the shrimp were nice sized! The sprouts were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was a great flavor touch! The tamales were nice and light (came with two). Lastly, the duck tacos (came with 3). Man, such a great end to the meal!!! Chef Aaron stopped at all the tables throughout the night just to check on everyone and make sure they enjoyed their food, which I thought was a nice touch!   This is such a great local place that truly makes an emphasis to serve delicious food with quality ingredients. I am so excited that Tapas 51 will be added to list of incredible, locally owned restaurants with the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Food was well crafted and delicious but considering the price the servings sizes were quite small, even for tapas."}
{"text":"I was strongly suggested this place about 5 weeks ago by a co-worker who said it was a good meal and he liked it.  Well...if they say it must be that good, who wouldn't want to go right?? Well here are the low-lights of my three attempts: 1st attempt: Kids were in school so I figured this would be a good day to take the Mrs. on a date-day outing.  We show up at 12noon, just to be told that the entire restaurant is closed for a private party.  They did have outdoor seating, but I guess that was closed too(even though noone was eating outside) 2nd attempt - About a week later (kids in school again)...I'm thinking date day again with the Mrs. She suggests we try Tapas 51 again and I say ..\"why not\".   They can't be closed for lunch again right...NOT!!  Pull up to the restaurant at 12 noon and this time the doors are locked.  Reallly? The website and online Yelp directory page both say that there hours are open for lunch.  Now I'm agitated!.  Tried to call the restaurant to see if anyone answers and to see what hours they are actually open.  Phones rings then an alert comes on just to tell me that the mailbox is full and to call back later.  How does a business not have a standard message on a phone system that states the hours and leads people to their website.  Mailbox full, call back late?? THAT'S SLOPPY. Now for our 3rd attempt:  For some reason ( probably because neither my wife nor I liked to feel like we're defeated) we decide to try Tapas 51 for dinner and this time take the kids. Well we show up and they seat us right away, which is always great with kids.  Well, they don't even have a children's menu.  A little surprising, but ok.....We go ahead and find something for the kids then order ourselves.  The waitress takes our order (never wrote anything down), then the order comes out wrong and missing items.  I order the Chile rubbed beef tacos and the Champagne fish tacos.  First thing I noticed when the food comes is the portion sizes..extremely small for the price.  While YES the food was tasty, NO TACO that can fit laid out in the palm of my hand should cost $3 each. My wife ordered the Grouper cakes.  She said they tasted pretty good but the size of the cakes are tiny for each cake costing $5 each...It's ridiculous. Those ARE NOT Pineville/Fortmill prices.  Those are more like South Park prices where the bougie upper crust can go to a place with these menu prices and feel like they are getting a taste of ethnicity.  At a certain point the balance between price vs.quantity vs. quality comes into play.   So there ya have it, my three attempts at Tapas 51...THERE WILL NOT BE A 4TH."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Everything was phenomenal. We tried 6 different things off the menu and everything was amazingly delicious and the chef is top notch. He made us feel very welcomed. Next time we are in town, we will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for great flavors of all dishes served. Great drinks, excellent beers on tap and a relaxed atmosphere. Worth a try and you will be back."}
{"text":"I love the food but not the atmosphere. I came at 7:45 pm for dinner and almost all the tables are full. The noise level is very high and It's hard to carry a conversation. The food are very flavorful using lots of cilantro, onion and lime. I ordered the Peruvian shrimp Papusa, beef brisket, empanada, bok bok chicken, churrasco, brussel sprouts. All the dishes are delicious and my favorite is the shrimp papusa. We had soppapilas and chocotorta for desserts. The soppapilas are similar to beignet is smaller size. I highly recommended their desserts."}
{"text":"The owner will try to bully you into giving him more stars or discredit your review that he doesn't agree with.  Customers make your business and pay your bills.  If I had sent back the food at the restaurant, I fear what might have happened from how he commented on Facebook:  WOW Kasey Nicole I just read your review on yelp as well as getting this one star here. I've also done my own research and read your other reviews so that I may properly address this situation. 1st of all I would like to apologize that our food was not up to your standards. I see you have dined at some of Charlotte's finest establishments and there doesn't seem to be any nice restaurants that is up to your standards(with the exception of fig tree which is an incredible spot). If I may be to bold to ask you a couple of questions to an aspiring writer as your self. Did you mention any of your grievences at the table so that we may correct them? What about the food was it that you did not like? May I ask what you ordered so I can recall the table? What about the service that you did not like? I personally cook 90% of the food and that is why we get high ratings, and the extensive training of not only the rest of the kitchen staff but our front of the house team as well. As far as our portion sizes yes they are smaller than your usually dishes ... we are a \"tapas\" restaurant ... Tapas literally translates to small dishes. and as far as the over priced... that is a matter of opinion, what is over priced for one person in not for another. I personally am ok with paying a premium for the quality of food, service and standards we provide. Take for instance coffee... you can get a large cup of coffee at a fast food chain for just about a buck, or you can spend $5 at a place like not just coffee and get really good stuff that you might need to wait for but its worth it... see what I am saying. Anyway I wish you the best in your endeavors to become a great food writer in the future but I would encourage providing a little more of a reasoning behind you conclusions of dislike or enjoyment of an establishment. Best Regards, Aaron Owner of Tapas 51.  My Response: I'm sorry that you didn't like my review, but your food was not good. I would not eat here ever again and trying to attack me by reading my other reviews \"and there doesn't seem to be any nice restaurants that is up to your standards(with the exception of fig tree which is an incredible spot)\" seems to be very childish of you. I'm sorry you don't like the one star review. I was also with my mother and she did not like the food either. I do literally knows what tapas mean and you shouldn't try to insult my intelligence.  I have eaten at many tapas places. Maybe you should visit fig tree or motor supply in Columbia and strive to serve food like those restaurants. And there was nothing wrong with the service. The hostess and the waiter were prompt and friendly. I also did give Soul Gastrolounge a 5 star rating as well, which is a tapas place as well. But trying to discredit my review by implying there doesn't seem to be \"any nice restaurants that is up to your standards\" is ridiculous because I have given other restaurants 5 stars, but I'm not going to rate a restaurant 5 stars if I feel the food is not 5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband & I were really excited about trying this place after seeing the rave reviews online. The ambiance was cool, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the entire time. They had some good local beer. Sadly, we were disappointed with the food. We had the brisket tacos, a swordfish taco special, Brussel sprouts, corn & a dessert. The only thing we really enjoyed was the corn. The beef tacos were fatty. The dessert was inedible. It was a \"Taco torte\" apparently (we thought the waiter said chocolate torte). It had definitely tasted as if had been sitting in a fridge for a week or more. It was like a dessert you are forced to eat at a family reunion that your great aunt made...an instant dessert of sorts. So bad. I know it's tapas but the portions were very tiny. We spent $60 and I left hungry."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch. Being that these are small plates and most people will want 1.5 to 2 plates it can be a little expensive for lunch. That said the food was excellent. I had the shrimp ceviche and realizing the small portion I also ordered the chicharrones. Both were excellent with great flavors. I have to go back and try the tacos. My other concern is that it wasn't busy, so please go. Also the location is horrible so you won't accidentally find it."}
{"text":"Tapas 51 is a hidden gem. We were starving after a fun day at Carowinds and looking for a healthy option nearby. We definitely did not expect the incredible, affordable culinary creations we feasted upon at Tapas 51. Every single dish is so carefully crafted to form the perfect combinations of savory and sweet, spicy and creamy. The brisket chorizo tacos, the shrimp papusa, and the chocotorta are absolute musts. The Chorizo Brussels sprouts and the sweet corn were also fantastic.  I could not recommend a restaurant more. Definitely coming back. *definitely recommend sharing as well"}
{"text":"guys. this place is amazing. I mean, I can't even tell you how delicious the food is here. Super flavorful, fresh and legit. def one of my fav places in charlotte."}
{"text":"Going through my top charlotte restaurant list and decide to pop in Wednesday evening. Not very busy and our server was really great. Go for the strawberry habanero rita! Sweet, spicy and salty rim yummy. My favorite dish was the grilled shrimp pupusa. Our server suggested it and I'm so pleased I had the pleasure of experiencing this unique dish. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the flavors were heaven. To top it all off the owner offered to walk me to my car with an umbrella in the rain. I will definitely return and try to make room for dessert."}
{"text":"We just happened to be passing through Fort Mill and the wife and I were starved. We had a series of unfortunate events trying to find a restaurant that was open and to our liking. Clearly someone was looking out for us because we wound up at the right place. Tapas 51 is in the old Passion8 location with a whole new decor. The wife and I split the daily special ceviche of NC bass, shrimp papusa, yucca poutine, daily special snapper tacos, brisket tacos and the \"pot\" brownie for dessert.  Everything was packed with fresh flavors and simply prepared. They used a lot of interesting plating devices like pieces of wood and ceramic tiles. The service was attentive and informative at answering questions. The yucca poutine was very good with all the components prepared and matched well. As a French Canadian, I would like to see them change poutine to \"poutine\" on the menu or maybe call it a South American poutine. Still a great dish, but us French Canadian are protective of our poutine. I just wish Tapas 51 was closer. Maybe a second location in Noda?"}
{"text":"Great selection of food, several combinations I've never heard before . Very quaint and quirky atmosphere. Most of the dishes were pretty good but by far, chorizo sliders and squash were the best!"}
{"text":"This place was fabulous.  We loved everything. A definite hidden gem. We will be recommending this to friends."}
{"text":"The empenadas were excellent last night as was the sweet corn dish. The corn dish was my favorite,  so awesome that I want to try to replicate it at home. We tried the tacos as well and they were a bit of a let down, we didn't feel the flavors really melded well together or lived up to the hype. In addition,  the coffee brisket taco had none of the flavors that were advertised. We had another dish with shrimp and the texture and flavor was way off for me.  I can't remember the name of it.    The location is a bit off-putting as well, to be honest.   I think the food is a bit pricey for what it is.   I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to Charlotte from California this place has one of the best fish tacos I have ever had! Their fresh grilled corn taken off the cob is amazing too! So many fresh flavored here and small bites. A great destination for any palette."}
{"text":"Awwwwwww sheeeeiiiittt! This place is the ish! Forreal. We're planning on moving back to Charlotte towards the end of the year but WE WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK!!!   All the food was good and this pear drink I had was great!  The Papusas was on point. The cheesy gooey filling with the big ass shrimp on top with the sauce and avocado was dope. I could have eaten like 4 of those joints and been good. The street corn was like New York street fair corn on a higher level.   The empanadas are not your average empanadas you get at a Mexican restaurant. It's like pulled beef and the sauce to accompany it was sooooo good.   The tacos were dope too.   Zack is the man. He was very attentive and helpful with what to order, especially for our first time there. He came up with the pear drink I had. He used to work as a Bartender in a Charlotte restaurant and he used to come up with different drinks that were popular.   Yes! Yes! 1000 time YES I will be back for the food and service. They were nice enough to give me a birthday dessert which was similar to a Tiramisu (which I've never had). It was soooo good. The candle was a nice touch too.   Yea don't sleep on this place. Fort Mill, Charlotte, Indian Land peoples... you need to come to this place."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant in a bad location. Bad because no one knows it's there and from the outside it looks like as shack. They have really updated it since it was Passion 8 and it looks great on the inside. If only people would flock to this place so that it stays open! I really enjoyed the tapas style food and everything was excellent. Between 3 of us (women) we ordered 8 tapas and had more than enough food. Tuesday nights are also half price cocktails from their menu, which was a bonus! The service was great, but we were the only table that night. I will be back and I recommended you go too!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined her for Valentine's dinner last night and gotta say that aside from a couple of highlights, the whole experience was a bit disappointing. Before I begin let me explain that I do not think my expectations would've been set as high if it wasn't for the prices. We've been to Soul Gastrolounge several times and always really enjoy it, and I just cannot on any level justify the fact that Tapas51 prices are right on par with Soul's prices but for much smaller portions.  When we arrived the place was packed, but since we had reservations we were seated within a few minutes. Even as busy as they were, the staff was friendly and service as a whole was great.  We ordered the ceviche of the day, the taco of the day, grilled shrimp pupusa, Kobe beef kabob, and chorizo sliders.  The highlights of the meal were by far the pupusa and the chorizo sliders. I have eaten many pupusas in my day and I gotta say this is probably the best one I have ever had. It was moist, the cheese inside was nice and melted, and the grilled shrimp were cooked to perfection. I do think it was a bit overpriced at $9 since a pupusa is basically water and corn meal, but it was so good that I would happily pay that again.   The best dish of the night was the trio of chorizo sliders. The homemade chorizo patties inside one of the best biscuits I have ever had was just a perfect combination. The chorizo was moist and cooked perfectly and so was the biscuit and it I wasn't so full I would've definitely ordered another round!  Unfortunately, the Kobe beef kabob was the biggest disappointment taste wise. It was overlooked and dry and I was a little sad that someone could do that to such a nice cut of meat. I am not a waster, but I took one bite and just couldn't justify eating the rest.  The taco of the day was a scallop taco on some sort of pistachio tortilla and the dish came with two tacos and each taco had 1 scallop cut in half. The taco was good, nothing really special, but I didn't think anything of it until we saw on your bill that it was $15. I have tried every authentic taco truck in town and have had tacos just as good or better than this for $1.25-$1.75 each. I understand that this restaurant is not a taco truck, but charging $7.50 for a taco the size of my palm with 1 scallop in it seems vulgar to me and a bit like they are taking advantage of their clientele.   As you can hopefully take away from my review, the food was not horrible, and two of our dishes were actually very good. But, overall, the prices they are asking for their dishes are unjustified and unless the prices are reevaluated or the portions are increased, this is not a good value for your money."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find through Yelp and I did not know what to expect.  I thought it was Mexican but then it said Tapas which traditionally is Spanish but to my surprise it was tapas style but inspired by the entire a culinary mixture of different Latin American dishes. We ordered the grilled shrimp pupusa and it was awesome. The Yucca huancaina poutine which was good, the cochinita pibil belly that was so tender and flavorful, and the taco of the day which was a sword fish with a delicious cream.  Once done our server Alyssa asked if we had room for dessert so she about to recite the offerings and the first thing mentioned was the Tres leches.  I quickly halted her and asked to say no more and to get me teh Tres leches.  It was to die for."}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the second you walk in, there is a warmth and minimalist but lovely atmosphere. Then, once you taste the food, you stop caring about what the inside of this place looks like because you have to leave and go slap your mama because it's that damn good. The brisket tacos are unlike anything of the same name that you have ever tasted before, the street corn will henceforth be the corn that all other corn is measured against, and the shrimp papusa is this explosion of all these flavors so delicious that you won't even want to swallow (ahem, sorry). OH and the butternut squash gnocchi in the chorizo sauce with the queso fresco cheese??? make like Nike and just do it. Go here,  you won't be sorry, I promise. One of the best tapas places I've ever had the privilege of dining at. Yep, ended that sentence in a preposition but I don't care bc this place made me not care."}
{"text":"Small plates creates an atmosphere of a fun tasting menu that everyone can share. The food is fresh and vibrant!  Try everything and then orders seconds on your favorite!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot in my neck of the woods. Finally a place close by representing the local vibe I always have to go closer to Charlotte to get. The owner and Chef Aaron is delivering excellent small plates with varying tastes. And by the way, he beat Bobby Flay on Bobby's tv show. First, the strawberry habanero rita is awesome with just the right punch. There is also a nice selection of local beers and an array of wines by the glass and bottle. We had a couple of Rita's and then a nice glass of wine. Outdoor patio is nice but be ready for direct sun until after 730. The server Sidney was attentive yet not bothersome. She made suggestions on menu options and drink selections.  She even got the chef to come out to the table so we could \"beg\" for some chips from the daily fish taco option. They were house made salt n vinegar chips. Delicious!!  There are an a sundry of taco and small plate options.  Definitely recommend and will be back in the future. I hear he is going to be changing up the menu in a few weeks."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, but went for the prix fixe menu on NYE and it was excellent! Thankfully, there were 3 of us, so we tried almost everything. Perfect way to end the year, and the creativity and flavor impressed me as always! Try this place if you have not!"}
{"text":"Lovely little spot that was really a great surprise. The food was delicious and we all enjoyed what we ordered. I do wish that when a party of 4 comes in that it's not an issue when the goal is to share plates. A serving of 3 should automatically go to 4 (price adjusted) etc."}
{"text":"Go.  We sat at the bar after house hunting. Dan was great, well informed, and helped us choose well. Several items chosen, including the special ceviche which was amazing!! The bok bok chicken was fantastic, the shrimp papusa was fantastic.  Desert was the chocotorta which has no chocolate but crazy good. Lovely space- very reasonable for what you get. Yeah, when we move, we will Be back!!"}
{"text":"The fella and I have been here many more times since my first review, so I'm updating! Tapas 51 is pretty darn awesome. I feel like they've found their rhythm with food, service, and atmosphere.  Speaking of food, a quick rundown:  - Brisket Empanada - YUM! Pretty darn delicious. Didn't try the sauce it came with because it didn't need it. - Chili Coffee Crusted Brisket - Eh, a little dry. - Duck Quesadilla - I think the quesadilla was warm, but the rest of the ingredients were cold, so it was a weird combination... good flavor though. - Chcolate Torte - the best dessert I've had a loooong time. Comes in a small mason jar, but it's so rich, you can't eat that much."}
{"text":"Based on the look of this place I would have never gone in, but thanks to yelp I tried it. Omg was it delicious! Those 3 tacos (coffee something) were amazing. Their drinks are great too."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were up for trying a new place and saw the great reviews for Tapas 51. It did not disappoint! The menu is relatively small, however it still gives variety without being overwhelming. I wish I could have tried one of everything, but we ended up choosing the beef empanadas, lamb mole and pork belly tacos. All delicious. I wish I could have tried the ceviche but am 5 months pregnant at the moment so will have to save it for another time! The staff was very attentive and courteous. It's definitely off the beaten path and very unassuming (you wonder if you're in the right spot when you pull up for the first time). It was fairly empty for a Saturday night, but I'm hopeful that business will pick up and they can keep their doors open!"}
{"text":"cool place, good service, great food (got to have the Mexican street corn!)... a bit pricey, but kind of expected at a good tapas place....desserts are on par with the food..."}
{"text":"I wanted to celebrate my birthday at a restaurant that I knew would have great food, professional service and a comfortable yet urban ambience. I picked Tapas 51 and they went beyond my expectations. Upon arrival, Chef Aaron took us to our table. My menu had a unique addition at the top \"happy birthday Bethany and welcome to Tapas 51\". Nice! We ordered drinks but before they arrived, glasses of bubbly cava were placed in front of us. \"Compliments of Chef Aaron\" we were told. Really nice!! We started out with red bean dip served with pita with charred marks which lent a tasty smoky flavor. 51st street corn, shrimp pupusa and yucca fries with chili arrived and were devoured quickly. Fried oyster tacos were complimented by cilantro and pickled onions. Chorizo sliders and gnocchi did not disappoint. Dessert was delivered. I had a lovely plate with the chocolate inscription \"Happy Birthday Bethany\" accompanying my pot brownie. That was gobbled up along with the peanut butter churros served with a divine chocolate sauce and whipped cream on the side.  If you have something to celebrate, Tapas 51 will do it in style!"}
{"text":"Can't give zero stars, so had to give one. Honestly cannot give a review of the food because we have been unsuccessful twice getting there when they are actually open. The first time, they turned us away because they had a private party. Second time, they were just closed. We went at lunch, 11:30ish. The hours state they open at 11 during the week. Maybe it's a sign and we should just forget it. Just don't see how anyone runs a business and the posted hours are not correct. Wrong on Yelp and on their website. Also, when you call, it goes to a voicemail thats's full. Don't think we'll try his again."}
{"text":"I guess my review is now \"in Memoriam\" - a bit shocked to hear this place has closed. However, when I came to meet friends here for dinner I did note that it was really tucked away and not very visible from the road.  My visit was on an evening when there was a \"switcheroo/restaurant swap\" with Paul Verica from Heritage. So in reality, I was eating Chef Vericas food.  The breakdown: Guacamole with sunchoke chips                            Duck Confit                            Empanadas                            Tacos                            Excellent server, selection of draughts/wines, sangria                            The best thing = Cookies and Cream dessert - just look at my picture - a                                                       beautiful and fantastic composition of flavors!!!  I wish Chef Aaron the best and heard a rumor he moved to Colorado!!"}
{"text":"We went for first time tonight. Probably best quality food since we moved to SC in June. Everything thing was made fresh.  Loved the low key vibe. Great for a date nite or out with a few couples.  I would have given it a 5 but it's a little pricey. We will definitely be back. Owner worked out table. Solid service."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop.  Unique menu with unbelievable flavor.  The shrimp pupusa is to die for."}
{"text":"If you don't know what tapas is or don't like tapas.. don't come here and then write a one star review because the portions are \"teeny, tiny\"... IT'S TAPAS! It's not Golden Corral.  The food here is sublime. Get the grilled shrimp pupusa. The conchita pibil belly taco and bok bok chicken chicken are also very good. Street corn rocks and my wife says the brussel sprouts were fantastic."}
{"text":"Very innovative chef! Great ideas.  Masterful creations of small plates.  They change the menu often (which is good and bad)..  good because of variety, but bad because if I really like something, I want it again.  They could have a few more wine selections (on the medium-upper end)  Overall, I had a great experience. I've been there twice.  Great location too."}
{"text":"Best tapas in Charlotte hands down. Drinks are great, food is phenomenal. Great staff and everything comes out fast. *HIDDEN JEM*"}
{"text":"Terrible place to have your first pupusa as none will compare. From the outside you may be wondering if the reviews are true but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Middle of nowhere, actually the northern edge of South Carolina, this hole in the wall serves great tasting food from beginning to end. Latin  meets Spain located in the South. Chorizo sliders, gnocchi, street corn, and many other dishes -- don't perseverate, just pick and enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything we had in this place was absolutely phenomenal. Each player was uniquely flavored and full of character in every bite. The service was excellent. It's a little pricy, that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 starts. Nevertheless, I'm \"food happy!\""}
{"text":"This place is insanely good for tapas.  It may even be the best tapas we've had in Charlotte.  And the food being incredible isn't all...this place has awesome ambiance.  Service excellent too...we'll be back."}
{"text":"We FINALY found it!  That small, out of the way place that uses fresh ingredients and has a fantastic chef making out of this world food!  BONUS: Their cocktail creations rival the food. FIVE STARS!  Be sure to try the Columbian Chorizo Sliders and the 51st Street Corn. So good!  The Strawberry Habanero Rita is fantastic!  Fort Mill needs a dozen more places just like this one!"}
{"text":"Excellent evening at Tapas 51.   The food was fresh and expertly prepared.  I can see why Chef Aaron beat Bobby Flay.  And the service from George was icing on the cake."}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path (for me anyway), but well worth it. I've had the pleasure of dining at Tapas 51 a handful of times now (including for a special event, their Dia de los Muertes dinner), and each time, it has been consistently fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive and the food is simply amazing. Great presentation as well--you can see the care that goes into each dish.  On our latest visit, my husband and I shared the following: Mooooo (I order this every time because I can't resist), Taco of the Day (NC trout, heaven in a fresh tortilla), brussels sprouts (Chef Aaron will have you daydreaming about brussels sprouts after you try these), shrimp pupusa (which is a thick tortilla stuffed with cheese; what was life like before I discovered these??), and a bottle of wine (half price on Wednesdays, woo!).   A few in our party ordered the butternut squash gnocchi so I stole a bite of that as well--and then I was sad I didn't order it myself.   My advice? Visit often and arrive with an empty stomach and a few friends so you can try as many dishes as possible."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Mexican inspired tapas.  A few beers on tap, decent bottled beer and wine selection, and a respectable liquor selection with about ten chairs around a bar and two TVs.  Small to average sized menu... Everything was delicious and we just about tried it all.  Desserts were fantastic as well!  Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Come here!!! The chorizo sliders were delish, the coconut shrimp ceviche was really tasty.  We also got the brisket tacos!  Woah those were good!!! I would definably come back here.  The atmosphere feels cozy! Loved loved it!"}
{"text":"Little yellow house with a graveled drive but looks are definitely deceiving here. The inside is spotless and very modern with a full bar and friendly staff. Started out with their signature strawberry/habanero margarita.  Unique, and served in a tall glass with lots of lime, ice and a pink Himalayan salt rim. Basically, we tried almost everything on the menu-well there were 4 of us-and each dish was better than the last. The corn tortillas are hand made and each dishes attention to detail makes the dining experience one of a kind. Loved the ravioli and the roasted corn was delicious    Save room for dessert the Chocotorta with a homemade toasted marshmallow on top and French press coffee with very thick cream."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I normally do not have time to get online and write reviews for places but I had to for this place because it was AMAZING!!  My mom had been here a couple of times already (mind you, they haven't been open very long but they are good enough for a repeat visit within a one week time span) so she wanted us to come and check it out for our birthday! The restaurant was easy to find and the appearance was very welcoming- a very clean and modern look!  The waitor greeted us immediately and knew the menu inside and out and explained everything to us in detail- he was very knowledgable of the food and the drink choices so naturally we chose to start with Strawberry Habenero Margaritas!! YUMM! They were sweet and spicy and delicious!  After the chef came out and greeted us and made sure that we were enjoying our drinks we chatted with him for a bit and  decided that we were going to do a tasting of the menu and try a little bit of everything. He immediately went and created a ceviche with the daily fish to start with. It was very light and refreshing and tasty- it went perfectly with our drinks! The rest of the night was just plate after plate of incredible food! We had pork belly tacos, the MOOOO, Chorizo sliders, brussel sprouts, etc. We even ended the night with two dessert choices, the Chocotorta and some kind of tres leche with bruleed peaches! Both were insanely good! I left the restaurant that evening so full and very satisfied. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and I even plan on having them cater an event I have coming up! Thanks for the great dinner and experience Chef Aaron!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we were able to get into this place before they close this weekend! We have heard such great reviews of the place and all the reviews lived up to their hype.   The empanadas...oh the brisket empanadas, I'll dream about their delicious taste and fluffy pastry texture. Everything about them was perfect. The shrimp papusa (sp?) was also so light and full of flavor. I could have eaten about 10 more of them. The coffee rubbed brisket tacos were also 2 bite flavor bombs.   The bacon tacos, they were a little fatty for my liking, and didn't have much flavor. The ceviche was fishy, but those were the only two not phenomenal dishes that we had that night.   If you haven't made it over there, definitely try to by Saturday, or you'll miss out on something special."}
{"text":"CLOSED!!! Owner sold in February and moved to Colorado. New place called \"Small Bar\" opening soon. I'm pissed!!!"}
{"text":"I had a birthday dinner here recently. I wish I had left the review then so that I could tell you what I had lol. But the food was good. I enjoy tapas style restaurants because I don't care much for entrees. I like to sample lots of things at one. The prices are reasonable so that you are definitely able to do so."}
{"text":"So last night I had my birthday celebration at this restaurant since my reservation at the pump house was cancelled, I totally appreciate the owner/chef Aaron Rivera for being able to accommodate my large party of  16 with such a short notice. The food was awesomeit comes in small portions but they are all very good and all of my guests were very happy with their order. We truly enjoyed that they put us to the very back of the room and have the whole space to ourselves. The only thing we would change is maybe the tables should have been longer and not separate so it's easier to communicate to all of our guest but over all the service was stellar, our server I forgot her name but she was exceptionally great and attentive, a few hiccups with the beet to beef empanadas but over all this place have their shit together. The ambience was awesome, food was seriously excellent, staff was really great I recommend this place to everyone!!!!!! Visit this place and I can guarantee you will come back for more! To the owner and staff thank you for the great job you do!!!!! We are sooooo happy"}
{"text":"Girls Night Out-Just 4 of us and it was my 1st time to Tapas 51- I am kind of a picky eater and reviewed the menu before going to \"pick out\" what I knew I would like- 2 of my girlfriends had been to Tapas 51 another time and they knew just what to order- I just went with what they ordered- Butch the waiter told us about Chef Aaron and how Chef goes to the farmers market everyday to pick out the fresh produce.  Between the 4 of us we split 4 types of dishes- 1st- CHILI COFFEE CRUSTED BRISKET TACOS-WOW!!!!  AMAZING!! EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!  (Picky eater or not-all the flavors married together perfect) 2nd-CHORIZO BRUSSELS SPROUTS-WOW!!!  I don't even like Brussels sprouts- Well I didn't until that day!  The sprouts were definitely fresh from the garden and the Chorizo that was used in the spouts were the perfect compliment!   3rd-51st STREET CORN-I could eat the whole bowl of that myself without sharing!  (Hint, Hint for next time..lol) 4th-BEEF EMPANADA-  By this point, our bellies were filled up and probably should have ordered these 1st as the are very hearty and filling.. Best way to describe this dish was a Spanish Calzone- I went home that night so happy because I had great quality time with my dearest friends in an environment I felt comfortable and cozy in- Its 2 days later and the thoughts of the fresh and invigorating flavors of the food have stayed with me and now will be back soon with my husband!  I am also proud to say because of Tapas 51 they have opened my horizon of new foods and maybe not being classified as a picky eater anymore!"}
{"text":"The food at Tapas 51 is outstanding - everything we tried was delicious. This was our first time dining here, and I have to say the location is a little off the beaten path. In fact, I thought Apple Maps was failing me - then voila. Once inside, our server was attentive and helpful, the drinks were great, and it was the first day of a brand new menu. We tried a lot of the classics from the old menu and were blown away. We will absolutely frequent this place. Don't miss the Chocotorta or the Apple pie for desert."}
{"text":"I just had lunch there and it was so freakin delicious. Every single thing was spot on! I cannot wait to go back. My favorite was the duck egg poutine- dipping yucca fries in the egg yolk was to die for. You must go! Best food I've had out in awhile!!!!"}
