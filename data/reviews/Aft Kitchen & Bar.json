{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with 2 of us. It was not extremely busy and there wasn't a line up, but all the tables were full. We had the brisket sandwich with bacon which was the smokehouse sandwich of the day and the BBQ side ribs. The food was 5/5. For cocktails, we had the bourbon sour and smoked peach bourbon sweet tea which were nice and refreshing for the summer. It's a cozy, small place. There is a patio which we didn't get a chance to see. I would highly recommend this place for 2 to 4 people."}
{"text":"We wandered into this restaurant after a concert at The Opera House and I'm so glad that we did! What a surprise! The restaurant is small and cozy; we loved the atmosphere! Small menu but a good selection. The BBQ chicken was really good - super juicy and tender. I usually avoid ordering chicken but this was cooked to perfection. The portion was huge! My bf got the pulled pork mac & cheese and it was just as yummy! It was really flavorful and filling. We loved our dishes and had a great time! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Living just blocks away from Aft & hearing good reviews from fellow yelpers, my friend & I decided to have an early dinner.  We arrived around 5pm, and were seated promptly, and asked for our drink orders, in which my friend and I both got beers.  He got the Cobblestone Stout & I the Okanagan 1516 Lager... both tasted REAL GOOD.
We then ordered, the platter for two, which consisted of 4 ribs- pulled pork -bbq brisket-coleslaw- hand cut fries- roast potato salad... the hand cut fries & the brisket were definitely the winners here.  We even ended up ordering another bbq brisket with double the fries after... major carb overload... I couldn't move after ( the owner will remember us regarding this :P ).
The service is friendly & attentive.  The space is small, but the food makes up for it.  We will give it a try during the week to sample other dishes, but please serve us bread this time, we just don't want to see others enjoying it. Thank-You"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from AFT and have been eating there twice a week for a good while now. Until yesterday, they would have garnered 4 stars, but now they are down to 1 star due to the owner's Sh***y attitude. 

I usually order the ribs, which are outstanding. Have tried the wings, found them a bit tough. Don't like any of the sides. But the ribs do shine (as do the sauces) and deserve 4 stars. 

Yesterday I ordered the weekend BBQ platter for two. I called in the order from the online menu, picked it up for takeout. Online price was different from the what they charged me ($33 online vs $37 when I went to pick up). The owner became offended when I pointed out the discrepancy, threw $2 from his pocket onto the counter, said he was taking the website down and began to walk away. I pointed out that it was more than a $2 price difference & that I would cover it, I was just letting him know...so he took $5 from his wallet, angrily put it in the till and then disappeared in a huff. 

Not cool dude. 

I lost my appetite. Nonetheless, the portions are good. However the brisket & pulled pork lacked any real flavour other than the familiar smoke that infuses all the meats there. 

If you don't mind paying a douchebag's rent, definitely try the ribs. But nothing else is worth the bother."}
{"text":"Went on a whim while passing by. Good experience overall with a few minor things that weren't the best. I had the smoked chicken, which was a bit dry but the flavour was amazing. The in house made BBQ sauces provided on the table help alleviate the missing moisture in the bird. Atmosphere was cosy and nice especially sitting at the wood bar. Food prices were great but the beer prices were a touch high (reminded me of the over priced chains in the entertainment district). Overall will definitely be going back to try the ribs, which were unfortunately sold out that night."}
{"text":"1. The Manhattan I had was unreal! 
2. Got the platter for 1 with bbq brisket & bbq 1/2 bbq chicken and my two sides were coleslaw & baked beans. The sides were standard... I love me a good slaw and baked beans are a side Go-to for me. The brisket was my fav! Its a must have. The bbq 1/2 chicken barely got touched because there was so much food!! 
3. Also tried the bbq ribs and they were smaller than anticipated because they are cut into bite size. They were good but a little tough for my liking."}
{"text":"Went there last night with a group of 7 and were seated in the back patio which is quite nice. Ordered the bourbon sour which was terribly executed and had very little alcohol in it. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu as we were a large group and I have to say that they good was BAD BAD BAD all around. 2 people in our group got food poisoning the next day which is never a good sign.
The BBQ was dry, over cooked and mediocre at best, there are much better spots for this genre of food in the city- eg- stockyards and electric mud both of whom specialize if mouth watering southern BBQ.
In my humble opinion, this place is not worth the fuss, skip it for sure"}
{"text":"Been in a couple of times. Breakfast is fantastic! Can't beat their smoked dishes.  At night, the ladies working seem to want to be there but overall not that welcoming"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out as was intrigued ...being round the corner from where I live. Well I must say I was really impressed. They have a BBQ menu for the weekend from which I ordered the brisket of beef with two sides,coleslaw and potato salad. The beef was super tender and the portion was so huge I had to take some home !!!
The place has a similar vibe to Grand Electric ..... the food was excellent with massive portions and the price was excellent. The mains were all $12 to $15 isn so reasonable.
I look forward to their other offerings during the week.
I am so happy that there is a decent place in this neck of the woods as quite frankly I really am not keen on most of the restaurants in this strip and find myself driving to Queen West usually.
This place gets top marks......"}
{"text":"Finally, a nice snug pub in Leslieville! All the beer, wine, booze and food is hand picked and there is a great mix. But the best part of ths place, the conversations. The bartenders, Paul and Jarrod (ex-Cabbagetowners) are both easy to talk to and make sure people get introduced. Just has a great feel...

If you are looking for a 'snug pub' then this is your place... hands down."}
{"text":"\"BBQ platter for two.\"  

It sounded like exactly what we wanted tonight... and we were not disappointed.  My wife and I sat down in a cosy atmosphere with thematic music.  The tables looked great, made of solid wood and decorated with nothing but a single candle sitting in a mason jar.  The whole place smelled of smoke and meat.  Delish.

We ordered the BBQ platter for two for $37.  We selected the Chicken, Ribs and Brisket.  We also ordered the beans, 'slaw and fries as our sides.  Much to our surprise, instead of beans we received potato salad.  Upon informing our server, she quickly apologized and brought us out the beans we had ordered, so we essentially received a free side of potato salad.

The meat was tender, flavourful and very well cooked.  There were three sauces at our table to use, and one was a Peach-BBQ sauce that was quite good.

All in,  (dinner, a drink, tax and tip) we paid $28.50 a person for a belly full (very full) of delicious meats, sides and flavour.

I do believe we'll be coming back.  Especially when a few friends from out of town come down to visit and want to go out for some tasty grub."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  Went on the recommendation of another restaurant owner, and I'm so glad I did.  First visit was for lunch - I had fish tacos, my partner the club sandwich with fries and we split the portobello frites.  Those frites are seriously what keep us coming back.  
We have been back twice since, both for dinner and both on Tuesdays for their pound and a pint wing special ($16 for one, $30 for two).  We have had to restrain ourselves from going every week for those wings - they are so juicy and perfectly sauced, though I love their mango hot sauce.  Their fries are nice and crispy, and we love the seasoning.  I had their smoked peach lemonade on my first visit, and look forward to enjoying more of their cocktails, because it was so tasty.
Generous dessert portions as well; I tried the sweet potato pie and their cheesecake on different nights (these change frequently, and I can't wait to try as many as I can).
We will be headed back regularly for their specials - buttermilk fried chicken on Wednesday and steak frites and a bottle of wine for two on Mondays.
Price point is in line with what I would expect to pay at a lot of the newer restaurants; approximately $60/couple+tip.
Service has always been very friendly, and attentive.  Can't wait to check out their back patio."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The food is always amazing (favourites include the Portobello Mushroom Frites and whatever is on the dessert menu). There's a good selection of wines and creative and yummy cocktails (try the smoked blueberry margarita!)  I know Aft specializes in bbq but I usually have fish or something else from the feature menu.  Service is always friendly, knowledgeable and prompt."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly service. Funny that all of the above are so hard to find in Toronto!"}
{"text":"You must try their weekend BBQ. Incredible value for the amount of food you get. All the meat is succulent and moist. Don't leave without trying the smoked peach Arnold Palmer. Out of this world."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to Toronto on a whim vacation and we were not disappointed here!!! We happened to stumble in when we were looking for a place that still had their kitchen open, and decided after a bit of walking to just settle on this place.

The food, drinks, and atmosphere were all incredible. The staff was so friendly and quick with our drinks and food. Best service/food combo I've ever experienced. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place four stars cause it means more people will go there. Cozy environment. There's a tree growing in the middle of the outdoor patio. Love the atmosphere. Food is great! People are so friendly.

Did I mention, there's a friggin tree growing in the middle of the outdoor patio. I should've given this place one star, but I have to be honest, it's just so damn good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I cannot go without visiting it at least once a week. The BBQ brisket is absolutely heavenly, I have not had anything like it anywhere else. 

The service is always excellent, Jay and the staff do a bang up job of making sure everything is as perfect as can be. The patio is probably one of the best night time secrets of the city....it feels like you are in a hidden tree-house terrace.

Check it out, one of the true Riverdale/Leslieville gems."}
{"text":"I tried Aft before a show at The Opera House down the road, and I'm fairly impressed. We were seated immediately outside on a small fenced patio behind the building. Our server was prompt and well-informed. Tuesdays are taco night, $12 for 3, brisket, pulled pork, chicken and fish. My guest ordered the sous vide steak (which was rated top 5 by Now Magazine, apparently). 

There are 3 home-made sauces: one sweet with mango, one smoky (a Texas-style sauce), and one hot pepper with maple. These sauces were great to compliment my tacos. The tacos were of a fair size but somewhat on the cool side (likely had to wait for the steak to finish). The steak was fantastic; I can see how it's top 5. The fries were crisp and well-seasoned.

Overall, I'd return to Aft if I was out in that area, but I wouldn't make a special trip. My one wish is that the food was a bit warmer, but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"So happy that Aft Kitchen & Bar has opened! It is the perfect, and much needed addition, to this neighbourhood. 

The design is gorgeous and clearly this is a place made by people with good taste. Everything feels carefully chosen and chosen with purpose. 

We sampled the portobello fries, the ribs, the steak sandwich, and the steak frites and all of it was melt in your mouth delicious. 

I can't wait to go back,"}
{"text":"Had the Dinner for 2. Cost $30 and we had to take food home. EVERYTHING on the plate was delicious. We had the ribs, dark meat chicken and beef brisket. The sides were French fries, potato salad and cowboy baked beans. I will definitely go back. Sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday.  I was thoroughly impressed! The BBQ is delicious and the food to price ratio is a hungry persons dream.  The $37 platter for two (3 meats, 3 sides) was delicious and beyond filling.  Highlights were the brisket and cornbread.  Weakest link were the ribs.

A lot of people say the music is too loud.  It is loud, but I found it to be on par with other bars.  I guess I wouldn't recommend this place as somewhere to go have a meaningful conversation.  Maybe it's restaurant loud, but it's not bar loud.

The cocktail menu is also impressive and has some really unique (ie smoked) options.  Sure, they're a bit pricy ($10-$12), but they're 2oz and the relatively low price of the food offsets it."}
{"text":"Food: incredible. Just getting that out of the way.  They even make their own hot sauce!  We got there early enough to avoid a wait, but there were people starting to line up by the time we left.  I had the ribs (I've been on a bit of a ribs binge lately!), and they were excellent--perfectly cooked with a nice crust (and delicious sides!).  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the French Toast for brunch last time and it was delicious (although a bit pricey for me). 

Today, had the portobello mushroom frites and they were amazing! Also tried the hanger steak frites, so good. The chicken wings were yummy as well. 

I don't think you can go wrong here. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I kind of don't want to review this place as, selfishly, I would prefer it not get so crowded that it becomes impossible to get a seat, however, it's definitely worth a review!  I have been 4 times now and honestly, I have yet to have anything bad.  I highly recommend the panko crusted portobello fries, I dream about them they are so good.  The buttermilk fried chicken which is a special once a week is to die for as is their smoked blueberry cocktail.  The tacos, a weekly special, are also delicious.  The steak frites is unexpectedly tasty and I would go back weekly just for that dish alone!  Staff is friendly, interior is cozy, there is really no downside here at all.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Impressive. Very impressive. 
This is definitely the type of restaurant that makes me want to rethink all the other five star ratings I have given out, because this is now my new standard for what constitutes a five star experience! This small but mighty bar had the most incredible food, I know it doesn't want to be pegged as a bbq house, but that's all I could smell when we walked in the place. Which naturally forced me to order smoked chicken wings. SO good.  The wings were tender and smokey, like ham wings.... I ate 7 of them which is a lot considering I also had Portobello fries and the hangar steak with chimmichurri. All dishes were perfect, the steak was perfectly rare, perfectly tender and hugely seasoned with seasoning I wanted savour forever. The price was also perfect, two of us dined with a few bourbons for $62, you do not get better than that.

The service deserves recognition; the place was rammed with people by 730 on a Friday, and the entire night we felt like we were the only people in the restaurant service wise. I love the simple hipster meets rustic country feel of this bar, the raw edge wood tables caught my eye the whole night. It's noisy, squishy and saucy goodness, and I would not have fallen in love if it was any other way. I'm so impressed Aft, I have a good feeling you'll be with us for a long time."}
{"text":"Proper BBQ @ Queen and Broadview! 
Just had the smoked, cheese studded ground brisket burger and hand cut fries here and all I have to say is - Awesome. I tried the excellent house-made ketchup, BBQ and their wicked habanero sauce with my fries. I put nothing on the burger. It comes with a nice aioli and requires no further dressing. Quality ingredients, perfectly cooked and ample in portion size.  
The decor in this cozy spot is warm and uniquely Canadian. The staff are super friendly. There are several craft beers on tap at the fully stocked, rough-hewn tree-topped bar. I am impressed. The price point is very reasonable as well, which is surprising in an area where over-hyped, over-priced mediocrity has become commonplace. My burger and fries with a pint of Blanche de Chambly came to $22, incl. tax! 
I dig Aft. I'll be back to try the steak frites next ($20 and hear its fanastic). Heck, I might even go by tomorrow night for a pint after work just to take in the heavenly smell of BBQ that envelops the joint!"}
{"text":"Aft is one of my local go-tos. The food is consistently delicious, service is informal and good, drinks menu is solid as are the bar staff, oh and the baked beans are incredible. Love this place, especially in the Summer when the patio is available."}
{"text":"Aft has a great vib but beyond that the food and cocktails are excellent. I have been here several times since it opened and it has always satisfied. The beef brisket is flavorful and tender. All the house BBQ sauces (3) are very unique from one another. The sides are tasty but the beans should be a larger portion (hence my 4 star rating, otherwise it would receive top marks). The staff is friendly and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Had plans for a concert at the toronto opera house and decided to check out aft after reading a few yelp reviews. The pictures were one of the main reasons for making the stop.

We started off with a pound of wings and the bean dip. The wings were amazing. They are smoke not deep fried which is a great change. You can literally taste the difference. The bean dip was also a great appetizer. 

For mains I got the special of fried chicken and ribs. Wow. It's hard to describe fried chicken that tastes this good - but imagine taking a bite and having all of the chicken slide off of the bone and literally melt in your mouth. Easily the best fried chicken in Toronto. The ribs were also spot on. There are 3 sauces that accompany the bbq so you can find the flavor which best suits you. The fixxxxxxins were also amazing. Nothing could make this meal any better.

The servers continually went out of their way to check in on our table and we're very knowledgeable on the bourbon and beer selection. It's great to have servers who are passionate about their food and craft.

I will be coming back here soon. Bon Appétit."}
{"text":"After spending a month dreaming of Aft's steak sandwich, I walked the 10 km to their door one Sunday, arriving at 1:30 pm. With high hopes and an empty stomach, I sat down only to be greeted by a brunch menu - with no steak sandwich in sight. I left broken hearted and hungry !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I probably come here once every week. During the summers, their outside patio is nice with a 'backyard' kind of atmosphere. A bit small but cozy. Their house BBQ sauces are amazing, big fan. I usually go for their smoked ribs, wings, and occasionally get their daily smoked meat sandwiches, depending on what their special is. Their menu is a bit small and limited so keep an eye out for their specials as well, it usually changes each day."}
{"text":"Is it fair to leave AFT just three stars when everything was objectively perfect, but the food I ordered just wasn't to my taste?! Not sure, so bear that in mind when reading...

Came here for brunch. Server was very genuine, funny and friendly, making us laugh a lot. Portions were huge - very good value for money here. The tea and coffee arriving in French presses was also a great change from the norm!

The \"Broadview Breakfast\" I ordered unfortunately just wasn't to my liking. The menu description made me assume I was going to get a traditional Canadian style breakfast, but the beans came spicy, Mexican-style, and the home fries were peppery and seemed to have curry powder on them. It was fine, and I would have appreciated the uniqueness if the menu had described it, but being hit with such strong spicy flavours for breakfast just wasn't my sort of thing. The bacon was also really tasteless.

I will definitely return though - the food was mostly perfect (except for the bacon), but it just wasn't my sort of thing, and that's not AFT's fault."}
{"text":"Aft Kitchen and Bar was opened not too long ago in Riverside (on Queen East). The place is small and properly furnished with wooden tables, wooden counter top, and wooden light fixtures. The brick wall gives some needed warm and character. 

We may went there on a cold evening but reality is that the place was fairly cold and I had to keep my jacket on while in there. Not very pleasant.

They don't take reservations but as long as you arrive before 7PM I think you should be fine.

I opted for having their featured dish, a buttermilk fried chicken with coleslaw, biscuit, and collard greens. At first I thought that the chicken was moist but it ended up being somewhat dry. It was a bit on the flavorless side (disappointed). The collard greens were great and so was the biscuit. The coleslaw was very average. They did not win me with that dish.

Aft Kitchen and Bar  did not have a cocktail menu but they had a list of available wines. I had a chardonnay from Estrada Creek and the wine also did not wow me. 

I don't have any reason to come back there and I quite did not understand what was their strength. Oh well, I don't expect to find bliss at every bite."}
{"text":"This is in the east end and I wouldn't normally go but we were invited to a birthday dinner. This place has great food. It was raining when we went so we did not have a chance to enjoy their patio which apparently is really nice. I shared the for two meal with my husband and great value. The servers were a joy. I would go back to try out their patio for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know if we were just there on a off night or something, but left feeling absolutely perplexed as to how this place has such a good rating. BBQ was extremely sub-par, and a complete disappointment overall. The drinks also, sheesh. Service was also all over the map. I don't know what was going on, but with everything that was so wrong I can't possibly see how this was a fluke. YMMV greatly apparently. 

If you're longing for actual good BBQ in Toronto, I'd definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, good service, cute patio in the back, friendly staff! Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Their brisket is the best in Toronto especially if you like them fatty."}
{"text":"I had the ribs, which from what I had seen in reviews (blogTO) looked delicious, but they were barely edible. They were so dry I couldn't get any meat off of them. 
My friend had a sandwich and fries which looked good - I tried the fries and they were quite tasty. Cozy atmosphere though, and pretty good service ."}
{"text":"Aft is alright. Nice staff, great patio and excellent house-made sauces. 3 stars as my ribs were underdone and not at all close to falling off the bone. Husbands sandwich was ok but not mind blowing. Will be back however to give them another try."}
{"text":"I stumbled here after seeing yelp reviews when our original restaurant was booked up.  And I was not disappointed.  

The restaurant is small, it has probably 7 or 8 tables meant for 2 people and the bar. I got there at 645 on a Friday and luckily there was a table available. After that a line up started  to form and people were having their drinks as they waited in line.  The staff is nice and friendly. And the service was great. 

I had the habanero Cesar and my friend had the blueberry Margarita. The cesar was light and spicier than I anticipated but,  very good.  The Margarita was perfect,  not like any Margarita I have had. 

We got 2 appetizers,  portobello mushrooms and catfish sticks. Fish sticks were Ok.  The mushrooms were delish.  Marinated,  grilled and fried with a panic crust.  It's good with or without the dipping sauce. You must order it. As our main I got the smoked half chicken and my friend the steak frites.  Let me just say the fries are amazing. Skin on,  crisp but still tender inside. It reminds me of mamas boys fries in scarbrough but better and thinner.  Best fries ever! The half chicken is huge and yummy combined with their BBQ sauces. Tender, juicy and slight smoky flavour. I would have preferred a more prominent smoke flavour. The slaw is OK. The steak was cooked perfectly,  so soft and the chimmichurri sauce was a hit. The only thing missing to complete the meal was dessert which they doing seem to have.  I would definitely come back to try their other menu items"}
{"text":"Loved AFT and can't wait to go back. Great selection of beer and wine, the steak frites with chimichurri was to die for! It is small but definitely worth it if you need to wait."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch and dinner. Grew up in bbq country in the states and this by far the best bbq I've had since moving to Canada. Brisket and pork were tender and cooked perfectly. A very welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good food and the local beer was awesome as well, the owner was really good with all the customers"}
{"text":"It seems the quality of the food has degraded so much compared to the reviews 1 year ago. 

I ordered ribs and brisket which was very dry - similar to eating table crackers. The brisket was 1 inch thick and the ribs were not that great. But the coleslaw was good. 

Similar to other comments, a Swiss chalet dinner would have tasted better."}
{"text":"I was visiting TO from Boston and stumbled across this amazing place. Delicious coffee served in a French press. Food looks like an instagram post and just so delicious. Service was amazing. World class spot."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner last night on their patio. Went with a group of 6 others and we all tried to get different things... All we're amazing! I personally got the brisket and it was superb. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Aft is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The wings are amazing, some of the best I've ever had and have ruined wings for me because all I want is Aft wings. 

The sauces are all delicious that they give you. Ribs, fries, chicken, just everything Is unreal. Getting hungry typing this. 

Apparently they have a really nice patio too."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks. Didn't have any food. Drinks were good and on the high end of \"moderately priced\".
Ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Second brunch visit. Loved the Hash and the Eggs Benedict. Great atmosphere. Nice service. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and it definitely checked the boxes in some areas, but the food or at least what I had could use some work.

4 stars for the service and ambience. We got a seat on the patio after waiting just a few minutes. I really loved the patio. It felt like we were in someone's backyard.

4 stars for the wings and fries. The wings were especially good. I also liked the BBQ sauces.

3 stars for the pulled beef nachos. The nachos needed way more cheese and more toppings in general. It was just chips, small amount of cheese, beef, sour cream, and some radishes. How about some guacamole, jalapeños, more cheese, beans, etc? I make better nachos at home.

Overall I give it 3.5 stars and would probably return for the wings and try the pulled pork sandwich or one of the other BBQ items."}
{"text":"So I decided to give Aft a second chance after the failed sous vide steak and I'm so glad I did.

This time I stuck to the BBQ stuff and had the pulled port sandwich.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My friend had the ribs and they were really tasty too.

Moral of the story here is if you're going to a BBQ restaurant, don't order a sous vide steak - stick to the BBQ stuff and you'll be happy.

#aft #bbqgoodness"}
{"text":"Love this food! Sous-vide steak was melt-in-your-mouth tasty. The fries were perfectly done. Friends had the chicken wings and pulled pork (that day's special) and also raved about the barbecued goodness of it all."}
{"text":"I've been here early on a Saturday and late on a Friday and always had a blast.
A narrow space that has been well designed to look cozy and rustic but still maintain a modern feel. I always try to sit at the gorgeous bar where you have a fantastic view of their impressive bourbon collection. While I think that they have some of the better ribs in the city, my fiancée was delighted by the french bread for brunch this weekend which came as 4 huge individually battered and fried pieces. Outside of the immense selection of bourbons they keep a good array of beers and wines.

Always a great place to start or end a day!"}
{"text":"Food has been solid after three visits, service as well, intimate and casual, good stop in during a walk in Queen East!  BBQ is their specialty!"}
{"text":"I have eaten barbecue all over the world including an extensive tour in the American south and I will say this is some of the best barbecue I've ever had. The brisket was phenomenal. They are also one of the few bars where you can get a really good Sazarac. I will definitely go back and make it one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Came here a little while ago for a birthday thing. It is very good BBQ. Had the wings and they were delicious. The fries are also so nice and smokey. The sauces were all homemade and a great balance of spice or sweet. Recommended."}
{"text":"My bf and I checked out aft after it caught our eye while taking the streetcar west to dt from my old hood. it was definitely worth it. The owner whose there most of the time is very kind, and is open to conversation and honest recommendations about the food and neighbourhood. I love the interior decor here its very modern and chique w a mix of authenticity with exposed brick which I am always a fan of. They have their own smoker in the back where they make all the meats which are absolutely mouth watering. Also, they have a great, intimate back patio, wonderful for a date or close friends catching up. I'll warn vegetarians this may not be the most vegetarian friendly place, but it is truley a meat eaters heaven!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Aft for dinner. And yes, I think the smoked peach vodka lemonade is one of the most awesome cocktails anywhere. We love this BBQ place. It is small, and tonight we sat out on the rear patio. What a lovely setting for dinner, and we made note of the lovely outside bar area as well. For me, it was the wings and pint special for $16. Great wings and fabulous fries. I sure didn't need the caesar salad on the side I ordered, but it sure was good! My husband had the ribs. Same thing. Great meal. Aft is a really terrific casual spot in Leslieville/Riverside. So glad we live so close!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with a nice ambiance and delicious BBQ. The menu was a bit limited, but there seem to be different specials each day of the week so you can take a look and see which you'd like to try. On weekends they have a BBQ menu, which was delicious. Reasonably priced too, and some nice craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a birthday dinner. Was comped a drink when they found out it was my birthday, it was a habanero ceasar which was superb. We had the platter for 2 of ribs, brisket and sausage. The ribs especially were tender and delicious. Unlike other bbq places where the flavour is sauce dependant, the meats themselves are delicious even though the sauces are too. Birthday dinner for 2 with pre and post dinner drinks were only $100 before tip so this place doesn't break the bank. Great value, will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was hungry for some ribs and have been disappointed by other places. Then I found Aft on Yelp. I was intrigued since their ribs are side ribs and not back ribs.

I will start by saying the coleslaw and fried are very good. The slaw is not overly dressed and the fried have a nice seasoning to them.

Of the three BBQ sauces given to me, I prefer the smoky sauce over the habanero and medium hot sauces.

I have to say that any place which serves side ribs over back rib will always get two stars from me. The ribs were meaty, flavourful and the spice rib on them quite good. My only complaint is the ribs were not very smoky flavoured, I guess that's what the smoky BBQ sauce is for. I will definitely go back there again"}
{"text":"First of all DO NOT pass on the chicken wings they are delicious!!! Fries are okay kept eating them because the sauces were delicious too. One of the main attraction here is the steak sous vide a way of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath. Went with three friends all our steaks were perfectly done and we really enjoyed our evening foodwise :) service was also excellent and attentive with a great wine bar."}
{"text":"The BBQ platter for two is definitely enough for 3 people. You get to choose 3 bbq selections (ribs, pulled beef, chicken, brisket, etc) and it comes with two sides. We got the ribs, brisket, and pulled beef. To be honest, after returning from a trip to the South, I was not too amazed by the ribs or pulled beef. The ribs were too dry and bland while the pulled beef could have had more flavour. The brisket was definitely the highlight as it had a defined texture of flavours. The fat content of the brisket was also on par with what I remembered from down South.

The sides made more of an impression on me than the mains. The coleslaw was creamy and refreshing. The pickles and peppers complemented the meats well. Also, as mentioned  by others, their bbq sauces were very tasty.

We also ordered cocktails, which were very well made. If I was rating this place for their sides and drinks, it would have definitely been a 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Aft since it opened, I work two blocks away - and our crew patronized Toucan Taco . I can't say I was sad to hear Aft is not run by the same people.

They took their time overhauling and reopening, it shows. The interior is lovely, featuring custom woodwork and light fixtures by a prominent pair of designers. The only challenge is a very narrow area at the bar. At the moment, there is room for several stools at the bar - but behind those stools is room only for 4 hi-tops and a banquette on one side. So two can sit side by side, but it works less well for a group of three or more.

I tried to take a friend last Friday night and arrived at 7ish. Hour wait, no reservations, but they are dealing with an onslaught of patrons in the most fair way they can. It is what it is.

We ended up eating elsewhere, but returned around 11 for wine and something sweet, which then turned into also something salty. Service was good, friendly without being inappropriately casual, super efficient. The coconut almond cheesecake tasted good and light. We also had homemade chips and bean dip. The chips were a little on the sweeter side but delicious, and there were a LOT of them. When they open for lunch I can picture myself on the patio with this dish, a book, and the full hour for lunch I'm technically supposed to get. 

We ended up trying again the following Monday. When I arrived at 7, the place was essentially empty. Before I could even be greeted, nine other people lined up behind me and suddenly place was packed. My dining mates did not arrive for another fifteen minutes (the third was an hour late!!) but they still sat me at a table for four (prime real estate) despite the fact that the party of seven could really have used the table (and would be paying more.) Even after I ordered nothing while I was waiting, they didn't ask me to move, they acted like they didn't even notice. After a few minutes I insisted on giving up the table anyways, but my point is this is NOT usual treatment in Toronto's trendy/popular restaurants. Hell, if you try to sit at a table at the Ceili Cottage and just order drinks? Lord help you for having the audacity to try. My point is they are focusing on welcoming service first and profit second. And at least in my case, well, customer for life. Basically, they had me at hello.

In the end my dining partner arrived and we both ordered ribs, her with fries. The ribs come up FAST, with three variants of BBQ sauce to try. 5 generous bones are somewhere between a dry-rub and your typical sauced preparation. And they were money, son. I mumbled \"I don't want this to be over,\" as I finished making out with my third rib. I wished for one more and my partner could have done with one less, so with an app I think it's the perfect portion for most people.

The slaw was fine and the baked beans were crazy good. We both agreed they were the best baked beans we'd ever had. The fries were a little underdone but the kitchen re-submurged them for us graciously upon request and were then perfect. 

Our late friend ordered the portobello frites. Amazing idea, but has the same mouthfeel as a deep fried pickle - without the lovely acidity. It's less frites, more like a mozzarella stick. As a mushroom enthusiast I insist the concept has potential and I hope they experiment a bit with the panko proportions.  

Table-side debit and credit payments ended things smoothly."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I would definitely recommend the shrimp po'boy. Will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the girls here on a Sunday night. We ordered beef brisket, chicken, ribs along with a Cesar, mushroom frites and black bean dip for our  vegetarian friend. The mushroom frites with Aoli were delicious! Bean dip was only good while hot.
Ribs were perfect, tender and juicy, almost fall off the bone but enough stick to really sink your teeth into.
Chicken (quarter dark) was moist and tasty. Brisket was good. 
It was very busy at 8pm but we were lucky enough to get a table quickly. Decor and ambience were cool. We'll likely be back again."}
{"text":"Very surprised and happy finding this gem in Leslieville. The beef hash and Hoppin John were really great picks. The three BBQ sauces appeal to all palettes: peach BBQ, smokin BBQ and spicy BBQ. I'm big into ketchup but didn't need it with these sauces. Tip: ask for the fresh jam to put on your toast. Amazed and will be back."}
{"text":"Some great menu items. The fish tacos were amazing!  It's a bit of a tight room, and there isn't much of a vibe or feel to it, but the food is great."}
{"text":"A small casual restaurant.  The menu is short and sweet.  I got the Philly cheesesteak with the steak done sous vide.  Tasty and filing.

The rest of the pages of the menu are a selection of craft beers and inventive cocktails.  I got the Okanagan Amber which went perfectly with my sandwich."}
{"text":"Good barbecue


I have been to Aft three times since it opened and I have enjoyed it every time. When we went, we were early for the dinner service  and luckily got a spot on the patio.  I have tried 4 different dishes here and they are all good(chicken, steak, brisket and burger). The hanger steak was cooked perfectly and very tender. It had chimichurri sauce which I am not a huge fan of personally, so I didn't really try it. The fries are exceptionally good.  Every table gets 3 different BBQ sauces with their meals, they are progressively spicier and all quite good and I think most people would find one agreeable as everyone at our table did. According to our server, they ribs are dry rubbed which opens up a huge debate, I am a fan of both sauce and dry rub and the ribs were quite tasty. The service here is casual but you can tell most of the staff are veterans, as they know what they are doing. Little things like they bring the ketchup before your meal arrives versus watching your fries get cold. This is a great neighborhood spot.

Overall a solid effort and if you are a fan of BBQ, you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some seriously delicious BBQ, it doesn't get better than this. The portions are huge and very well priced. This place is very new which is why everything is great right now but who cares, it still deserves a full set of stars. The place is super small inside so don't expect to be a large impromptu kinda group to get a table, unless you arrive super early. We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday with only 3 of us and we had to sit at the window bar stools - no biggie but we would have rather had a table.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have been here for brunch and lunch a number of times and their offerings never disappoint! They have a creative menu, including their cocktails and overall, I have been thoroughly satisfied with whatever I have ordered. In the summertime they have a really cute back patio so he sure to check that out. 

Note: I do find their service a bit slow so if you're in a rush and/or looking for a quick bite or cocktail, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I checked out on a Saturday night. Had a very pleasant experience. Great food, you must try their bbq if you are going during the weekend. Tey are amazing! Good cocktails and very nice and friendly servers. They are very helpful too. Overall, one of the few places that I have obliged myself to write a review! I highly recommend here!"}
{"text":"All your BBQ are belong to us.

After a going-away party at Hi Lo Bar down the street, my friend and I were hungry for yummy food at 11:30pm. While most kitchens are closed past 11, AfT impressed me with their menu of Smoked Peach cocktails, a pulled-pork platter, and sides of coleslaw and crispy fries -- all made from scratch.

The BBQ sauce needs to be reverse-engineered in my kitchen. It's perfect in so many ways. In the meantime, I'll be coming back again and again for the rest of the menu, especially the ribs.

The service was fast, even at capacity. Drinks showed up in seconds, not minutes. The food was mouth-watering. Clientele looked really happy, a good sign, and most opted for food instead of just drinks on a Saturday night! 

Bonus: the smoky scent came home with me. My partner said that I smelled good enough to EAT!"}
{"text":"Despite living nearby, I've only visited Aft twice - once for dinner and once for brunch.  This review will focus on brunch, as the dinner happened a long time ago, so my memories are a bit fuzzy and I don't remember specifics.

I actually didn't realize Aft even had breakfast options until, in an effort to feed my increasingly hangry husband, I turned to Yelp for nearby brunch options.  We have a couple old faithfuls in the Queen/Broadview neighbourhood, but we wanted something new.  Aft to the rescue.

For a small restaurant, Aft has a healthy brunch menu, consisting mostly of savoury meat-based dishes with an obligatory sugary option for those of us who are relentlessly tormented by their sweet tooth.  But really, what do you expect for a place that specializes in smoked meats and other barbecue flavours?  Vegans, turn away; there is nothing here for you.

As I said, my sweet tooth always prevails, so I ordered the french toast.  My husband stuck to the Broadview Breakfast, which consists of your standard breakfast fare - eggs, meat (your choice of sausage, bacon, or Canadian bacon), toast, home fries, and baked beans.

The portions are really hearty.  Despite looking a bit underwhelming, my french toast was too much to finish.  Battered in corn flakes and fried, I really enjoyed the crunchy texture alongside the doughy challah, and the light dusting of cinnamon sugar was subtle without being imposing.  As a surprise, it came topped with two slices of double-smoked bacon, which was more than enough to balance out the sweetness.

After tax and tip, I think we spent about $45 for our meal, which is pretty standard for two meals (no alcohol) in the area.  The only reason this isn't 5-stars?  My receipt pointed out that I paid paying $5 for \"Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice.\"  I didn't realize that pouring directly from a bottle of Tropicana (I watched this happen) was considered \"freshly squeezed.\"  I mean, I ordered the juice, I have no problems paying for it, but just don't tell me I've paid for something far superior to what I got.  The menu didn't really list any juices or coffees, so I just ordered what I saw other patrons drinking.  Honestly, I think my disappointment could have been avoided if I had just spent a few more bucks and getting something liquor based.  My husband spent $5.50 on coffee, but at least he got a whole Bodum worth.

Long story short - great food, limited coffee/juice options, avoid the orange juice, try a cocktail instead for a few bucks more (it is primarily a bar after all)."}
{"text":"The food was good, but i had some spicy pineapple cocktail i wish i could remember the name... It was to die for!! Yum. Nice ambience too. Bustling and warm."}
{"text":"You will be so happy, 'aft'er eating at Aft!!!  This is a great BBQ and drinks place in Riverside/Leslieville.  A huge enormous gigantic improvement from Toucan Taco Bar (which was previously in this space) if I can say!

We had the smoked chicken wings with fresh-cut fries, Tuesday taco special and the ribs with baked beans and coleslaw.  The smoked chicken wings were nicely smoked and very moist with great flavour.  The fries were excellent! Medium cut, well-fried, moist and nicely seasoned with a combo of spices and salt.  Ribs were super tender - fall off the bone.  It's a dry rub rib, so don't expect lots of gooey sauce (which I personally prefer), but these were some of the best dry rub ribs I've had.  The baked beans, which came with the ribs, were to-die-for.  Deliciously bacon-y!!  The Tacos were excellent.   We did the trio of flavours - smoked chicken, beef brisket and pulled pork.  All were done well and sitting on a soft delicious corn tortilla.  Some of the dishes were a tad over-salted in my opinion.   I had the bourbon sour to wash it all down....and it was just as delicious as the food.  
 
They have daily specials and only Texas BBQ on the weekends, which will keep me coming back.  Plus, they are looking to expand their bar menu.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Came here with our friends for a good ol grubbin', there was a bit of a long wait for a table. We got the platter for 2 and got ribs/beef brisket/pulled pork, our sides were corn bread/fries/macaroni salad. First off, the macaroni was not cooked and was still pre al dente. I had trouble with distinguishing which meat was which, but I believe it was the brisket that was reallllly dry-corn bread was a bit dry also. Was really hard to eat. I found the fries were a bit too over seasoned for me but my BF loved them. The pulled pork was good and the ribs were awesome. You get a lot of food for what you pay and possibly take everything else home in a to go box.

I would definitely come back, but I would avoid the brisket next time and stick to my favourite which are the ribs."}
{"text":"I would've gave this place a 5 if they had reservations but unfortunately not. Came on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy, at one point a line even started to build!

The setup reminds me of County General where it's narrow and has table and bar seating. 

I totally agree with Lauren M. this was the single biggest piece of fried chicken I've ever had, it tasted awesome though, probably one of the best I've had and I'm comparing to Stockyards and Harlem. Chicken was tender which was a welcomed surprise. The collard greens tasted quite buttery but it worked! Coleslaw was a little oniony for my taste.

The ribs were kinda dry but the sauces made up for them, bbq, chipotle and habanero (spicy!).

Service was excellent as well and kudos for having Sopparo on tap!"}
{"text":"Was impressed with the interior on arrival, and then found out there was a back patio and my socks were blown off. Really nice wood tables and bar to the side, and on a Thursday around 8:30 we were able to get a table without trouble. Beer menu is stocked with craft brewed options, with Okanagan Lager being my poison of choice on the night which went down well.

The menu is small but just about everything it needs to be. We started with tortillas and cold black bean dip which was even better than I expected it to be. Some people might be scared off of paying $14 for a pound of smoked wings, but the mountain of well seasoned and perfectly cooked french fries make it a fair option as well. I suggest ordering the wings \"skinny dipped\" for a bit of extra crunchiness.
For a main I went with the side ribs which were smoked to perfection and came out plain but they had 3 bottles of sauce at your table to choose from for dipping. I surprised myself by liking the sweetness of the Mango BBQ sauce over the smokey sauce that has actual fryer drippings in it, or the super spicy maple habanero.
The side of beans was amazing, although very spicy (assumably using the previously mentioned habanero sauce)! One of those things were you just want to eat it all at once because they are so good, but also because you want to get through the spice in one pass.
My lady chose the steak frites which she swapped out the frites for Caesar Salad (great choice, you could really taste the smokey bacon in it). The steak was well prepared and had a nice blend of seasonings atop it. Impressive stuff.

For a place with such a sweet patio, where nothing on the menu is over $20 and all is executed well (especially impressive given the size of the kitchen), 5 stars for Aft!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here.   We had shared a number of plates including the meatloaf sandwich, (Amazing), and the chicken wings (Also, amazing and cooked exactly as I like them).  The dessert was served in these glass jars (which we took to go and I still need to return them some time soon).

The staff were all super cool and friendly...  the place was clean... they have an amazing booze selection.   If their back patio had heat lamps it would be even better.

The bar doesn't have a TV.  Not sure if this is good or bad but if you want to catch the game and eat some wings or bbq while doing so, you might have to do it on the patio.

I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good BBQ.  And I will definitely return... even if to just give back the dessert jars."}
{"text":"Went out here today at 2:30 PM. I got the steak sandwich. I would say its okay but the best in this area. I like the theme and the patio they have though."}
{"text":"Based on the many glowing reviews, I really wanted to love this place.  

After finding a table on the nicely-done patio, my friend and I started with the tortilla chips and black bean dip.  The chips were chewy and over-seasoned while the dip had a cement-like viscosity.  For the main I had the brisket and (dark meat) chicken combo (a reasonable $22). The brisket was excellent, and made even better with the BBQ sauces brought to the table. Fries were perfectly done. The cole-slaw was tangy and well-executed.

But the chicken...

My piece of chicken was just barely cooked. The closer to the bone, the pinker the meat.  After having waited nearly 45 mins for our mains, I decided it was not worth the effort to send it back.  

Would I return? The brisket and fries were delicious, so perhaps. The ribs I saw on others' plates looked appetizing and worth a go. 

But I would never order the chicken again."}
{"text":"Away from the busy streets of downtown Toronto is AFT Kitchen, a small smoke house restaurant just past Broadview. It was quiet for a late Thursday lunch but it is quite small and will fill up quick. Its has a feel of a hidden get away, where you can go and meet up with a few friends for a quiet drink or meal.

The drinks were quite delicious and they have a great selection of beers on tap. I had the smoked meatball sandwich which was good but wasn't over the top delicious. My friend had the skirt steak sandwich which was great but majority of the sandwich was bread with less meat. While I wasn't impressed with what I got, I would go back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Simply savoury barbeque goodness in the east end.

Some of the other newer BBQ places in town popping up lately screams of hipster attitude and okay-okay-so-so meats in not-big-enough portions and hipster-ass prices (*cough*Electric Mud*cough*). Aft is much more chill, even if it reeks of dim lighting and reclaimed wood aesthetics. But it really reeks of grillin' goodness when you walk in--they got as they should an in-house smoker. They also got a rear patio that is a bit more spacious than their indoor space, though their table layout (which generally runs longitudinally to the floor plan) is smart and maximizes space and openness in such a narrow small area that other restaurants with similar situations should take a look at. Maybe it helps that Aft isn't such a packed place all the time.

Weekends offers a menu of various barbecue staples like pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket. We went for a platter for 2 deal, which gives you a choice of any three meats and sides. We figured it was good value. It looked like it was more a reduced portion of each picks when it arrived on our table, but it turned out to be an awful lot of good succulent barbequed proteins. The tender and flavour-exploding brisket cuts, the juicy pulled pork... oh my my. Everyone we saw leaving had a takeout box in hand, and despite being very hungry upon arrival, even I had to join the brigade. Aft should hand out specials for those who can wolf it all and leave empty-handed.

Service was slow at first (walked in to a bar staff briefing of sorts who all seem to not notice our presence for a long minute as they discussed work procedures and supplies and such), but generally was very friendly. They were even enthusiastic with shoving me with a handful of samplers of their barbeque sauces with my leftovers. Aft says they make their three sauces in-house, and damn you, I find them better-tasting than many of the sauces I sampled at various ribfests. If there is pride in their grillin', you can taste every bit of it.

The bar's various in-house cocktails are also something to dabble in.

{TTC: the 501-2-3-or-4 to Broadview or Carroll St.}"}
{"text":"Was in the area with my hubby and decided to eat here since I yelp all the time. We dropped in right before lunch was ending so we were the only ones in the establishment. Quaint and cool atmosphere. One of the owners greeted us and was extremely friendly. He explained to us the menu, sauces and drinks they make all in house. Very nice. 

Hubby got a virgin ceasar, the smoked chicken sandwich and ceasar salad and I got the chimmichurri hanger steak with fries. Great portions and absolutely delicious!  

Too bad we don't live downtown anymore or we would be here all the time. Definitely a place to chill and enjoy a nice day or night or even for weekend brunch. 

Thank you for the great first time visit!"}
{"text":"We had a great pulled pork sandwich here today.   They were making them on the sidewalk as a part of the Beats and Eats thing in Leslieville/Riverdale today.  If this is an indication of what's going on, on the inside, I'm coming back.  It'll probably be a great place for brunch, since brunch is a big deal in the hood.  I hope they stick around b/c a couple of other restaurants in this location didn't make it."}
{"text":"You ever really really really want to like a place but it doesn't measure up?  I did with Aft and it didn't.  

The portobello fries were great.   Nothing BBQ about them but they tasted good. 

The brisket was good but the saucy/mayo on the sandwich wasn't. Would have like to have is a a dinner plate option rather than a sandwich. 

The sous vide steak sounded good but at the end of the day you just boiled a streak.  This shouldn't be on any BBQ joints menu.  You just don't do that to a steak. 

We did like the hot sauce and peach BBQ sauce. Would have loved to take a bottle of each home.  

The lack of sides also causes this joint to drop points.  Where's the cornbread, mac n' cheese, beans and collard greens?"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Toronto's East end.  Smokey goodness and a cool hipster feel.  It's  a small place, maybe only 25 guests max, but the food and atmosphere is worth it.  I ordered Sous Vide hanger steak ... so flavourful  and so tender.  I could have ate it with a spoon.  Will definitely come back when I'm  in the area.  Attentive service too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to experience AFT for the second time. First time we were there, it was great. The second, was one of the worst experiences we ever had in the city. We were greeted by one of the bartenders, who was lovely and took our drink orders. What followed after however, was a complete disaster. The server was unpleasant and dismissive. She did not tell us about any of the specials but proceeded to tell the other table. We were being rushed, even though the restaurant was close to empty. We were not asked how we would like our steaks and once we revived them, they were extremely tough and chewy. Adding insult to injury, my fries had someone's hair in them. The server did a check up way before we took the first bite and did not return thereafter to check upon us, spending the rest of the time with the other table. I am quite upset with the whole experience and I will not be returning for a third visit."}
{"text":"Yeah if you have frequented Barque or Electric Mud then you won't think highly of this place. The bbq is...okay. There is nothing special about the ribs or the wings or the brisket. I'd say the bbq sauce and the habanero sauce is interesting but that's about it. Great service though."}
{"text":"This quaint restaurant was almost empty when we first arrived last evening but that didn't last long. There became a large stream of people both to dine in house and pick up take-out.

The menu on the weekend is short and to the point but covers most areas of BBQ (no vegetarian options that I could see). I wasn't thrilled that the only chicken option was a full half chicken but I know others who would be thrilled at that.

They also offer a full drink menu with signature cocktails and wine. Both my cousin and I tried their Smokey peach vodka lemonade and though it was an unusual flavour at first it quickly won our hearts.

My cousin had the pulled pork and I had the brisket. The sides were good though nothing over the top. Of the two I had, I would go with the coleslaw again.

On the positive side: portion sizes are huge, they have a sauce to satisfy every need and the meat was very tender.

However, the constant commercials on their music channel was very annoying.

Wait staff were attentive and price point was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great bbq! I had the ribs, which were really good, although a touch on the fatty side, but great flavour. Nice house made sauces, and the best fries. Got to taste my friends sous vide steak which was amazing! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Holy crap is everything here delicious! I got the fried chicken and switched the baked potato for frites (because, let's be real who can resist frites??) and it was definitely the correct decision! The chicken was juicy, crispy and super flavourful! The gravy was amazing and I loved the smokiness (word??) of the chicken.

I will definitely be coming back. Especially after spinning when I'm very hungry!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch today and may be new east side fave! 

Coming from the Beaches there is a lack of gastropubs or really anywhere with great food and great beer.  Aft had both of these and also great decor and service. 

Ordered a Sweetgrass Ale and a chicken club sandwich.  Beer was excellent and a great light ale to go along with the sandwich.  Chicken sandwich was excellent and served on a triangle ciabatta bun with pulled chicken, bacon and lettuce and tomatoes.  It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  The fries were cooked to perfection and a tasty addition. There was also some great sauce options to go with everything.

Two of us ate and had a beer for under $45 

Would definitely go back !"}
{"text":"We came here one night when all the other kitchens in the area had closed. In fact, we were pretty surprised that Aft's kitchen was still open on a Sunday night -- that's when our awesome server told us about Aft's policy to have the same, consistent hours everyday. Good idea!

I had the beef brisket and it was mind blowing. The smokey, rich flavours and fall-off-the-bone texture really hit the spot; oh and the BBQ sauce (the sweet one) was just incredible. The portion to price ratio was also generous.

We went back on a later date for brunch, and it was equally amazing. Who would've thought that gravy (keeping in the theme of smokehouse) would be an awesome substitute for the long-standing hollandaise sauce?

Definitely my favourite place to eat east of the Don Valley."}
{"text":"Came here bc I was craving ribs, I was thoroughly disappointed in the ribs. They were not fresh they were dry and tough. The brisket we had was good, but the beans were cold and the cheddar corn bread was just cornbread? 
Nothing special about this place, I had high expectations given the reviews and a friends recommendation, but I was disappointed. I hate when new restos do so well and then let quality slip over time, it's unfortunate."}
{"text":"First off, LOVE the fact that the kitchen is open until 1 am, the portions are generous, excellent doneness of the steak and most of the menu items are under $20!"}
{"text":"This is the best traditional bbq east of the dvp hands down. Split a plate of wings and ribs with friends and ordered the evenings special which was a monsterous chicken fried ribeye steak breaded in corn flakes and deep fried. Super rich and cooked to perfection, kudos to the chef on this one. 

I was by this place about 9 months back and enjoyed the bbq but they seemed to be lacking on specials outside of the norm (fish and chips.... yawn....) seems to be a step up in the service and the food. And I hear talk of a back patio that was booked out for the night for a private function. Look forward to checking it out on a hot day with one of the various southern/smoked cocktails they have on the menu."}
{"text":"No good. Ribs were unseasoned like no other. Fries were bland and dry. The cornbread was gross and had too many different flavours incorporated. The beans were the best side. Overall won't be coming back"}
{"text":"BEST BRISKET IN TOWN. FACT.

Not since my tour of Texas have I had brisket this good. We tried most of the barbecue offerings (weekends only for everything) and were pretty surprised with how great everything was! Aside from the incredible melt-in-your-mouth perfectly smoked Texas style brisket (served with Texas style sause!), the chicken was moist and tender with a subtle smokiness, the ribs were good and the freshly smoked sausage is something dangerous.

It's the small things; served with sliced pickles, (pickled) onions, and pickled jalapeños and white bread slices on the side, plus a variety of table side sauces make Aft a must try for anyone who even remotely likes the idea of cooked food. I can't wait to try the sous-vide steak and smoked chicken wings...

Disclaimer: I know the Pitmaster, but that's what makes this even more surprising - I've known him in his other career (the film business) so I had no idea he was capable of such truly great barbecue.

Go eat great barbecue."}
{"text":"The platter for two is amazing.  Had the ribs, chicken, and pulled pork. 

The hot sauce is very hot, the bbq sauce had great bite too.

The wings looked great, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a fairly good BBQ spot. Had the Mac n Cheese with pulled pork. The pulled pork was good but the Mac N Cheese wasn't very cheesy and had a odd flavour to it. Also had the smoked brisket sandwich.  Quite good and delectable.

Atmosphere is casual and rustic. Service was OK but nothing more than basic. You could do worse, but you could also do better than Aft. If I could give 3.5 stars, I would."}
{"text":"You already know about the seating capacity, the menu and the \"no resos\" policy.

Our story: 
Arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday to no line and multiple seat options. That was a bonus as I had read about long wait times.

Didn't notice the chalkboard specials but our server immediately went over them.

We could see the taps: Mill St (Tank & Organic), Steamwhistle, Sapporo, Okanagan and one other that I can't recall. Would prefer a smaller craft brewery on tap instead of the double Mill St but at least there are some craft beer options (a few bottles as well).

Ordered the Smoked Tri-Tip sandwich special. Huge fresh kaiser, slices of Granny Smith Apple, red cabbage slaw and the meat. Added their signature sauce and if was delicious served with seasoned, herbed fries which tasted better with their signature sauce. 

Missus: Caesar Salad with very tasty large chunks of bacon. Black bean dip (served cold) with crispy chips. She enjoyed them both but combined they were too much to finish.

Menu is limited but everything sounds fantastic.  Saw a couple orders of ribs go by and that is definitely my order next visit.

Service was friendly and incredibly quick. Almost too quick as we were dumped the bill while still halfway through our original beers. But that's ok, we already thinking about going across the street to the An Sibin for a couple. 

There again was no line when leaving and still a few seats available."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre compare to other BBQ restaurants in town.  What really turned me off was their extremely terrible service!  On a weekday night at 6:30pm, when the restaurant was half empty, we waited an hour to get our food.  2 of us ordered steak sandwich, and the meat was COLD!  Instead of asking for a new one, I kindly asked if they could just heat it up on the grill for me. Guess what respond i got from the manager or the owner (he's the one with beard working behind bar)?  He literally said \"do you know you ordered medium rare, the meat will not be hot\"?!  

What the heck?! He thinks I've never had medium rare steak before? He thinks I can't tell the difference between \"cold\" and \"warm\"? He thinks only his restaurant knows how to cook a steak? 

My friend's steak sandwich was cold too, but he couldn't bother to wait for an another hour for food. It's sad this place is being rated this high."}
{"text":"This place is like a second home to my friends and I. 
The atmosphere: cozy, love the backyard patio - it feels like you're being served at home. 
The ribs and wings are my favourite, along with their delicious fries. The daily specials are always a good choice too - rib tip sandwich and Mac and cheese in particular. 
Portion sizes are very hefty. Their bbq sauces are also made in-house and should be manufactured and sold in store - they're very delicious. 
The desserts...ah, the chef is just a genius. Usually comes in a cute little mason jar, the desserts often change but are always rather tasty. Their pumpkin cheesecake for the autumn season is a must-have (we split one three ways just to try it and then ordered two more..!) 
Their drink selection isn't the greatest if you want cocktails, but the food is the main reason you should go and it is well worth it. When you leave your clothes will smell of fine smokehouse and leave you craving more!"}
{"text":"Went here on a monday night for dinner. Weren't many people at 5:30pm ish but quickly became busy while we were there. We started with drinks .. I had the smoked peach Arnold Palmer. I thought it was a bit bland and for $11 I expected a bit more. Refreshing nevertheless. For entree I had the pulled pork sandwich with a caesar salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. We were also given three homemade BBQ sauces which were all tasty. I sampled some of the frites as well which were perfectly seasoned. Portions were absolutely huge. I could not finish the entire sandwich or salad even though I wanted to. Service was so-so. It took awhile to be greeted at first but our waitress was attentive throughout the meal. The decor was really cool. We sat in the back patio which was great. There was even a tree growing through the bar. Overall, fantastic food - but go hungry!"}
{"text":"At first glance, it seemed as if this place would be a treasure in a restaurant scene currently saturated by ribs and wings. 

However, one teeth sticking rack of ribs and an overpriced cocktail later, I can safely say - save your money for Prohibition two doors down.

When Swiss Chalet can make a better rack of ribs, you know you've got trouble."}
{"text":"This is one of the best, if not the best brunch I've had in the last  year. I had the Eggs Benedict, which was one of the best I've ever eaten. Even the side potato wedges were fantastic. With a tasty jet fuel coffee to top it off, this place nailed the brunch on every level. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to review this place in case it draws more attention and gets too crowded. An amazing BBQ place with very tasty chicken, awesome beef brisket and really good sides. There are many other BBQ items to choose from - I wish I could eat them all at once! Staff was great and they have a little cool patio in the back which just opened. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"We wanted BBQ on a patio for dinner, which is why we chose Aft.  The patio is at the rear of the resto, quiet, and has some tree coverage - these are all things I like.  Having said that, there wasn't much shade from the sun at 6pm and though it's not the hottest time of the day, it would have been nice to have a bit more coverage, as we did find ourselves a little overheated sitting in the sun.  To note: The tables are quite close together, so if you don't want your neighbours overhearing your conversation, this isn't the place to go.  Also, from time to time, we thought we could detect the odour of urine out there.  We guessed possibly from a cat or racoon?  It wasn't enough to cause us to leave, but we did consider it.  Anyhoo....onto the drinks and food.  Cocktails were reasonably priced and flavourful, if a little weak.  From the small menu, we chose wings, ribs, roast chicken, and fries, again, priced well.  The roast chicken was best.  I didn't taste the ribs, so I haven't a comment to make.  My companion thought the fries were super salty, while I thought the wings were.  All in all, it was an OK dinner and we left full, but Aft won't be on my list of favourite spots.  Oh!  The service was quick and friendly.  Good job on that, Gents!"}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. Got the chilli as an extra side and it was spicy and delish! Fries were awesome and steak was awesome! Cute patio out back."}
{"text":"My favorite smokehouse in the east side with great beef brisket.

The smoked drinks are pretty neat, the first sip of the Arnold Palmer hits you pretty hard with smoky flavour but once you adjust it's delicious."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical of Toronto BBQ places...especially since I am originally from Texas.  This place won me over right when I walked in.  The smell was something that should be bottled and made into a manly cologne or aftershave.  Got the platter for 2 which comes with choice of 3 meats and 3 sides....should be called platter for 3 because we could not finish. Super friendly service and great cozy atmosphere , along with delicious adult beverages made for a great experience.  This place is a must visit on the East end!"}
{"text":"Have lived right around the corner from Aft for months now, and I am sad that it took us so long to check it out! 

We came here on a Monday night for my boyfriend's birthday, and we couldn't have been more impressed. Amazing food, super friendly staff, great ambience and the drinks were good too!

We shared the steak and a sandwich (it was brisket that day) and we both enjoyed everything. Their house made BBQ sauces were the standout - all 3 were AWESOME. 

My boyfriend tried a beer here he has been looking for for a while - A local beer called Sweetgrass, which he enjoyed enough to have 2.

I went with Mill Street Organic which they have on tap, and then afterwards I got a cocktail - peach bourbon sweet tea (or something along those lines). I would have had 5 more if it wasn't a Monday night...

Overall great place - can't wait to check out their patio when it gets warmer. I also would like to try their weekend brunch & their chicken wings. Mmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome staff and great BBQ food. The portobello frites were a bit sour but the brisket was fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here on a warm Monday night after a sports game to enjoy the back patio. Had to wait a while for a table to clear, but our group of 6 didn't mind grabbing a drink at the bar first. We were greeted by a friendly but found him to be a little slow with his individual order taking and drink making (rather than surveying the group and making all drinks afterwards). We were also looking forward to being rehydrated with water as we waited, but each person had to ask him individually for a glass and then a refill. That being said, the cocktails were very tasty. We ordered a couple spicy caesers, spiked lemonades, blueberry-tequila cocktails and beers. On the food front, we had a couple black bean dips, a brisket sandwich, Caeser salad and side orders of fries. Food was good, sauces were tasty and the atmosphere was very relaxed."}
{"text":"We had the platter for 2, 3 BBQ items and 3 sides, ribs, brisket, chicken, corn bread, coleslaw salad and fries. Portions were generous and was enough for next day breakfast. Beef brisket sandwich is breakfast for champions. I think it was a slow night, they gave us extra ribs on the side. Corn bread has pepper inside, very nice. Service was great, they were always there."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of wings and fries. Great food and good service. I Like everything here specially the fact that its steps from my house and their kitchen is open until midnight."}
{"text":"How did any of you rated this a four star?? Do you call hot dogs on the BBQ , really BBQ?? 
Turn away from here if you have any history with good BBQ.

The pulled pork was not really pulled at all but chunks of mushy pork that had no bark, lacked that rich smoke flavours.
The beef brisket was dry, looked to be reheated and no smoke ring. It had a \"beautiful grey\" tone to it! Yuck!
The \"two sides \" came in what i would expect ketchup or BBQ sauce to come in. So not really sides, more like a fork and half full of each side.
Sides

Potato salad: this was over cooked baby potatoes basically tossed in mayonnaise. No vinaigrette or herbs to add to it.

Coleslaw: actually the fork and a half of this was pretty good. It was fresh, crisp
And had a nice taste.

The pickled onions: best thing out of the order. Bonkers to talk about these as they are standard pickled onions."}
{"text":"A cozy joint with good barbecue, great drinks, stellar personality and probably the best little patio in the back in the 'hood. Being between the Leslieville bridge and Broadview there are still many places trying to start blossoming around there and Aft certainly seems to be ahead of the curve. 

Highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Having been here at least three more times since my initial review, I have to say that Aft is pretty much my favourite evening haunt in Riverside.  

The food is quality;
the service is great; 
the prices are reasonable.

My initial beef was the cider options were limited to Strongbow.  Meh. Upon my last visit, there was the option of Pommies which was a huge improvement!

Honestly, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I checked out this spot on a weekday. We got a table inside and then when a table on the patio got freed up, we moved there. The ribs were tender and juicy, but overpriced IMHO at $20 for 5 ribs. The chicken wings, on the other hand, were reasonably priced and tasty. The service was prompt and friendly. The patio in the back is small, yet cozy. It's perfect for a summer evening. Aft Kitchen is a great spot for anything grilled, be it ribs or wings. Overall, it's a great spot to chill on a patio and have some ribs & beer. The menu offers a nice variety of food options and a decent selection of beer. I had a Bavarian lager, which I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. 

I had the chicken supreme, my friend had ribs and our other buddies had the special of the day - Fried Chicken. The fried chicken was singly the biggest piece of chicken I've ever seen in my life! My chicken supreme came stuffed with fresh apricots and some other goodies and served with garlic mash and seasonal veg. 

Food was all delicious and plated beautifully, prices were reasonable (mains $15-$19).

Our server was very very friendly and lovely, I want to say a bit over the top but I shouldn't complain! 

Not many tables in here, only seats maybe 20 comfortably. No reservations so be prepared to wait or arrive early."}
{"text":"It was surprisingly not crowded here for Mother's Day brunch! It was a beautiful day so we sat outside on their lovely, quiet patio. Overall, I'd say my experience was very good but the service left me feeling a bit confused.

We ordered Biscuits and Gravy, Brisket Hash and a coffee. Weirdly, the Brisket Hash was not on my menu. Another table also got a menu with the item missing as well. Why not throw out old menus?

The coffee came out in a French Press, definitely a unique experience in a restaurant. If you're in a group of 4 and each just want a cup, definitely go for this option. For a table of two, we'd have preferred just a cup each. My Biscuits and Gravy was delicious, so buttery and creamy and sausagey! It would have been perfect if it had come out warmer. I had a piece of my fiance's brisket and hash browns and it was so good, the brisket was so flavourful and tender.

Doesn't affect the rating: As for the servers, I couldn't tell if they were good or bad. There was something off putting about the way they spoke to patrons, but they did their jobs well. It's probably just me.

Side note: I would LOVE if Aft had an eggs benny with a biscuit instead of a English muffin!"}
{"text":"great service great wine. tues-fri is the best good deal nights. ill be back soon to check it out"}
{"text":"Only alright place for food!

Food: BBQ ribs were warm but not hot, with tiny portion of coleslaw and beans. My friend's chicken salad was dry - yuck! Will give them credit for making some sweet cocktails though.

Venue: small but trendy. Patio outback was full so can't review on that. 

Service: was subpar, didn't make sure we had cutlery and we had to ask. Wasn't very friendly either but could sympathize as it was one of the most humid days of the year - the poor staff in that boiling kitchen. 

Price: expect to pay $60 for 2 people for a main each, a drink each and tax and tip.

Tucked away on Queen East, this place is an OK place for some ribs or chicken. Not really worth the trek from downtown unless you're nearby.

Tip: some dive bars are nearby, search Hicks."}
{"text":"4.5*
Aft Kitchen & Bar is a newfound BBQ glory in the East end! 

In on a Wednesday night at 6PM, I was pleasantly surprised that it was already filling up! A cozy spot with a great selection of drinks, I will definitely come back.

Everything we had was delicious. The BBQ is where they definitely shine. They aren't doing any wrong!

**Whhhad' I get?**
- Portobello Mushroom Frites ($8) 
The top rec by the server - it was served with an aioli. On it's own, it was super tangy, the breading was packed with a ton of herbs and held a juicy bite, but with the much-needed dip, it was all slightly muted, delicious!

- Fried Chicken, Blackboard Special ($18) 
Incredible. The battered bits of the Chicken Breast was insane! The meat was spectacularly juicy and tender. Bone and all, it was such a nice big piece! The rice was wonderfully spiced and filled with tender pieces of Beef and Pork. I had a whole dang farm on my dish! 

-BBQ Side Ribs ($20)
These are Pork Side Ribs served with Coleslaw and Baked Beans. Beautifully glazed and tender. Perfection.

**Word is: Weekend brunches! Beautiful. Kitchens also close at 1AM. I'll be back.

Aft Kitchen & Bar is a new favourite!"}
{"text":"Give me all your BBQ! We were feeling indecisive so we asked our server for his favorites and went with all of his suggestions. Aft has the distinction of having the best pork sausage I've had at any BBQ place, ever. We walked away full and happy. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here on the fly just by spotting they had a patio and it was a fantastic decision. After looking through their simple, direct menu of BBQ meals and the diverse drink menu, I was sold. I had a beer and an order of ribs. It came with my choice of two sides (despite the menu saying 1 side--I guess they were in a good mood that day). I got the cheddar corn bread which was ok and the macaroni salad which was ok. Now they were tiny portions of each side that were \"ok\" at best, but if you look at them being free with the order--so to speak--it was was good grub! The ribs were fantastic and came with 3 additional different BBQ sauces, I won't say more, but they were my 2nd favorite behind my own recipe (humble brag).

This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"It wasn't a bad idea grabbing a bite before seeing a show at the Opera house. We just decided to search restaurants close to the place and thanks to Yelp, we found AFT! The food is awesome! Their fries is not just the ordinary fries that usually comes with a meal. Their sauces are divine! I think it's what actually brings out the best in their food. I pretty much dipped everything in the sauces, so not good for my waistline! I ordered the cheese steak sandwich with frites and the blueberry margarita. A nice meal and spectacular show for a very stressul and tiring work week for me. Place is small but cozy and the background music is relaxing. We will definitely come back here when we see another show at The Opera House. I have my eyes on the ribs and wings."}
{"text":"Came with 3 friends for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. After a short wait at the bar, we were seated at a table. Whiskey sours was very yummy, but I was denied a straw. The bartender told me the owner is very environmentally-friendly and doesn't provide straws - which I TOTALLY respect and appreciate. However, my teeth are super sensitive and drinking around that much ice was not pleasant. I also work with people with spinal cord injuries and many of them require a straw to drink. Having one package of straws behind the bar for people who explicitly ask would be appreciated. But I do agree that not everyone needs a straw - most of the time it is a waste and should be avoided. I had the smoked chicken wings and they were fantastic. Will be back (with my own straw)."}
{"text":"One of the more important foodie debates in Toronto is where to get excellent real smoked ribs. I found the answer tonight: AFT. I had an order of ribs that was, simply, excellent. And, I should point out that I myself am a smoker. So I know what's involved. The ribs were perfectly shaped, had a perfect smoke ring, and had just the right amount of softness to be easy but require a bite. Have not had better in TO. Also the beans and slaw were excellent as was my wife's wings. The fries are unsurpassable. Once I give it a second try, it could become a favourite. If there were more tables it would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"I first dropped in to this restaurant and the manager/owner was great in explaining the concept of the new resto... All reclaimed wood.  Since then it has gotten rave reviews so I tried it on Monday! The food is amazing! There is a great vibe. Love the steak sandwich and you've gotta try the fries with the thyme aioli, it's divine!"}
{"text":"I just landed to Toronto and my friend told me I have gotta try this restaurant even when I having headache and stomachache ....!!!! So we ordered Togo around 9pm. The food was really really delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! 1LB SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS $14,   BBQ SIDE RIBS $20  , SMOKED HALF CHICKEN $18      .......  I love it!!! Will dfnly go back again for other food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a good friend of mine to try out all the delicious food I've been hearing about this place.  What I had in mind, try out their awesome steak and their fried chicken... however, it turns out they are only served on weekdays. Ratzzz.

So we got the bbq platter for 2 with ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  We got the coleslaw and beans as a side.  So the highlights... I guess I'll have to say brisket and beans.  The briskets were done well, but I still like Barque's probably best.  The ribs as stated here aren't fall off the bone which we have all been spoiled with.  It's tough when you're accustom to fall off the bone to eat dry ribs.  I felt the flavour wasn't there and could have been smoked for longer.  The pulled pork was also a little drier than we have expected.  The good thing is that their sauces are pretty good, so feel free to go nuts.  The coleslaw was average but the beans, they were good.  

The servers were attentive and friendly.  The vibe in the place is your neighborhood come as you are type of feeling, which we both liked.  However, before finalizing my thoughts on this place, i will be back to try their steak and fried chicken.  For smoked foods, I wasn't super impressed... but as stated here by many Yelpers, their steak is danggg good and that's what I wanna eat.  I'll be back and when I'm back, STEAK ME!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the Smoked Peach Arnold Palmer cocktail - A+. Caesar salad to start was great, then chicken and back rub special with Maple Bourbon Glaze - actually phenomenal: have had Stack BBQ and Smoke and Bones and this was the best dining experience. Great ambiance and awesome appropriate volume music."}
{"text":"This is the best southern 'cue you can get right now in the GTA. Low and slow at its best. Ribs and chicken stand out. Brisket was tender but not smoky. Served with a big ol' slice of white Texas bread. Yummy."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, food was not too bad, service was great though! I tried the BBQ ribs and pulled pork which tasted amazing with the BBQ sauce. The sausages were not that great, tasted tough and average. The ambience is really nice here. I went at night and it wasn't too busy, I was able to have a quiet and relaxing dinner with my partner."}
{"text":"As someone who really loves a good BBQ, this place really hit the spot! Tried a little bit of everything, delicious. Our bearded server/bartender was extremely cool, made some excellent drinks to match the quality of the food. Definitely one of those little Toronto places you should check out!"}
{"text":"Well we've been to Aft 3 times now and each time the food was excellent; I've had the chicken with salad and the steak and home cut fries.  My husband is loving the ribs.  Quality ingredients perfectly prepared.   The place has a really good feel to it and the owners and staff are great.     Food, staff and vibe is 5 star.

The only downfall; it's small so there is a bit of a wait sometimes and they don't take reservations."}
