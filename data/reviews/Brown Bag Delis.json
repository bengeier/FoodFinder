{"text":"Just got a small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich and a cup of chicken chili from the Fifth Avenue store, and paid over $9. You can get much better quality and value elsewhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In one day,this place went from my fav everyday go-to,to somewhere I'd rather not go again. I have been getting the same thing every day, a toasted bagel with butter and creme cheese. For some reason,I was given a raw,stale bagel with margarine (which I hate). I feel like after like 3 weeks of daily visits, and me always getting the same thing,a toasted bagel with butter shouldn't be difficult. I was really hungry too! This happened once before,but I let it go. Nobody does things perfectly every day. After yesterday though,I'm gonna go to the Crazy Mocha next door for awhile."}
{"text":"This place has amazing homemade crab bisque soup! My turkey sandwich was good too. Quick and loved the friendly staff."}
{"text":"When you want a great deli with characters behind the counter, this is a hard place to beat.   Maybe it's my West coast sensibilities talking, but I'm used to delis being a place where dutiful counter-elves whip up a sandwich to order with a minimum of conversation, hopefully to your stipulations, payment is made, and all is over and done in a tidy and rather impersonal manner.   We won't get into why our how I happened upon Brown Bag, but suffice to say that it's left quite an impression upon me. The people behind the counters are characters, seriously--with personality and everything. The food is darn solid, useful in a pinch, and lots of options for something so relatively small.  Now it may not be the same when there's not a convention in town, so I can't tell you what that's like the rest of the year--I hear a lot changes in downtown Pittsburgh during off seasons. But I enjoyed it for what it was."}
{"text":"The service is super friendly and the food is amazing. The soups and macaroni are to die for. And I love their passion fruit mango smoothies!"}
{"text":"I know Brown Bag Deli is an old stand by!  But hey, every so often it's great to have a old reliable close to work, especially if you didn't have time to pack a lunch the night before!  I went for the Greek chicken breast wrap and some cole slaw on side.  Just so you know--everthing's ala carte here.  Still, BBD is worth a trip if need a satisfying lunch in hurry!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! We're from Dallas Texas and were in search for healthier food choices  than just restaurants and take out. He's has everything from chicken  salads to  chicken wraps to  oatmeal and much more! Sooooo much better than your average deli! And the service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Um, so I don't think anyone else has experienced this, but when I went to order with the woman at the counter, she smelled strongly of alcohol and didn't seem very coherent.  She didn't know what the specials were and asked me to tell her what they were which I found extremely odd.  The whole situation was alarming so I decided to put back the water I was holding and go to the Crazy Mocha in the same building instead.    I'm not sure what is going on with this place, but it seems like they need to change their staff.  This was my first time trying Brown Bag Deli too."}
