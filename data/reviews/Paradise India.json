{"text":"The worst place I've ever been. The owner is so rude to the people and the food looks shitty. One of my friend found a dead cockroach inside her dish too. I'll never going to this shitty Indian place again. Please don't go there for gods of sake!"}
{"text":"The first thing is their website needs to be updated. It states they have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm, but don't actually open until 5pm. The waitress was very nice, although too young to serve alcohol and was extremely inexperienced. We ordered an appetizer to share and 3 entrees, about 5 mins later we were told they didn't have ingredients for one of them. No problem, we changed the order and happily waited about ten minutes until they brought out 2 of the 3 entrees we ordered, telling us it'd be a bit longer as the 3rd was coming from a clay oven. The 2 with food started eating and shared our food with the 3rd, so she wouldn't faint with hunger. The entire meals were both completely finished, so we took the 3rd meal to go. No one over the age of 16 seemed to care that we weren't happy. We tipped the waitress 20% and will never be back. Too bad, as the food that we actually got was decent."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!! Tried it based on Yelp reviews in our neighborhood. Will definitely try their weekend buffet. William, the chef and owner spent some time with us - warm and friendly gentleman. Wishing him much success on this new venture. The restaurant looks like it needs some finishing touches but that will come with time - we went for the food and were not disappointed!!! Btw, 'mild' has plenty of heat so use caution when ordering, depending on your tastes. Tried plain Naan, Palak paneer and Chicken tikka masala - all awesome!!  Note to William: Have a professional do a complete cleaning of your windows:-("}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had in a restaurant in a long time. Came in for the buffet at 2:40, they close at 3. There were 2 customers in there already. The hostess said they are closing soon, but it's a buffet so we could still be served. The buffet had not been replenished in a while. Our water glasses were not filled until we had had time to get our food and sit down. We were told the naan would \"come with the buffet\" but wouldn't be made for us since they were closing for lunch. We asked why did she seat us if they weren't going to have a full service lunch? We ended up leaving without taking a bite and will not be back. Would not recommend based on terrible customer experience. Hostess/server was more concerned about playing on her phone than serving her customers."}
{"text":"The Best Indian food in Las Vegas  !!! Love the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Chicken Tadori  !! Free Garlic bread with the house white dipping sauce are so delicious !  The service is awesome.  They have lunch buffet too  We are going to come back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The classiest Indian lunch buffet I have been to. In contrast to what another reviewer said, we did get fresh naan bread with our buffet, and there was also a TV with not-too-intrusive Bollywood videos on, if that is your thing. The service was prompt and professional, and the food was so good I ate so much at lunch I wasn't even hungry until next day's breakfast. If I lived near here I would definitely have to pace myself."}
{"text":"The buffet was amazing for lunch. I highly recommend coming to this new establishment in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Yesterday I have tasted Goat Curry which is worst. They just mixed few goat pieces into a red pickles.. and costing high.  Worst food ever."}
{"text":"I love their meal prep!!! As a trainer and athlete, I rely on good food to fuel my body to get me through the day and my workouts. They are perfect for myself and my clients.  If you are in need of meal prep, Paradise India is awesome and Jared Aguilar can help you out!!"}
{"text":"Food, cost and service were on point. Came for the lunch buffet on a holiday and the variety of options were perfect. Flavors were great. A new favorite. We will be back with a bunch of friends next week!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Indian food at reasonable prices. Clean, large menu, friendly staff. What is not to like?  Everything is cooked to order and can be spiced to your liking from full blown Indian to to mild gringo."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch buffet, including the garlic nom and desserts! Plus the owner is a class act. Will return next time I am back in town!"}
{"text":"Great food!  No bar yet but we just brought our own wine. Great service too!  Chicken Tikka, Vegetable Korma,Lamb Vindaloo all great:)"}
{"text":"Chef/Owner - William is so helpful and friendly offered advise and volunteered to make anything we wanted on or off the menu .. The staff are are very friendly and knowledgeable This is the freshest tastiest Indian food I've ever had and that's a very high compliment as I am from England. Even better on the second visit ,can't wait for the third ."}
{"text":"Awesome place but doesn't seem like it will last unfortunately.  There are usually less than five customers at peak hours.  Please go and support Indian Food closer to home than on strip!"}
{"text":"One of the best indian places in vegas. It has,authentic biryani and buffet is worth trying."}
{"text":"Just awesome. Food, place and service. We went on new year eve and they had a special buffet. Food was really good with varieties. Quality of the food was beyond expection. Every dish was tasty and one of the best Indian restaurant i have come across."}
{"text":"We have eaten at most of the competition around town and this is hands down the best food going. Unique flavors to most everything and the bread pudding they offer with the lunch buffet is thee best we have ever found. We have been there a dozen times or more and never disappointed with anything"}
{"text":"Absolutely useless place for vegetarians. Everything from food selection and cutlery, was disappointing. As for cutlery was picked from a goodwill."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on at six on a Tuesday, and the place was empty! Surprisingly. the food was delicious.  I ordered vegetable samosas - which were beautifully spiced, and seemed freshly made - and Palak Paneer (also very good) - with lots of fried paneer, making for a very hearty dinner.   The prices were reasonable and the portions were large. I will certainly come back to sample more of the menu.  Why not five stars? Although the restaurant seemed clean and cared-for; The environment was neutral to the point of being bland. Certainly not every Indian place needs to have fancy tapestries or images of Hindu dieties. Modern and more Western decor is fine.  But the only things that even suggested \"India\" were the window facade cutouts and a TV screen silently playing dance numbers from Bollywood movies. Personally, I'd prefer a bit more 'character'. A dining experience is about more than the food."}
{"text":"This place is 5 star for the price and quality of food combo.  The food is really good, and the lunch buffet price is great.  There are lots of really good veggie options, the staff is friendly and attentive.  The naan is only OK, but this is still a solid choice for Indian food around here."}
{"text":"I've been craving Indian buffet, so found this place close to home. They had many veg dishes, about three chicken dishes, two rice dishes one with goat meat. The flavors were all great in every dish I tried. Overall we enjoyed the food,  the service was great. I thought the price was $9.99, but when we got there they had a sign with the price $13.99. I was told the weekday price is $9.99 and it goes up on weekends, good to know."}
{"text":"Samosas, palak paneer, basmati rice, garlic naan, and gourmet cupcakes. Wait, what?!   This is a great new Indian restaurant- they have a lunch buffet but definitely go for the good stuff at dinner. The chef is from OKC and is famous for his lamb, so keep those dishes in mind. They also have a case of cupcakes available for dessert, and their pastry chef is from the Venetian. Everything I've had here is great.  PAPADUM: Served at the table as you order, light and crispy with a vibrant mint chutney and a syrupy tamarind dipping sauce. This is gluten free, by the way. VEGGIE SAMOSAS: Three to an order, pairs great with the mint chutney. This has a fresh, flaky exterior and a savory filling. I like that this version isn't hard and crunchy as elsewhere. GARLIC NAAN: Four pieces of fresh, blistered naan with garlic and fresh herbs. Always gotta get a side of this. PALAK PANEER: Generous portion of spinach and homemade cheese. I like to get one meat and one vegetable entree, and this is my go-to order. Really liked the version here, order medium for a bit of heat. **LAMB SPECIAL**: This dish didn't have a name, but it's four lamb chops, marinated overnight and grilled fresh in a skillet with sliced peppers and onions, with a side of basmati rice. It's like an indian take on fajitas, served sizzling hot, and enough for two to share. This is some of the best lamb I've ever had, wonderfully seasoned and not gamey. This should be a permanent menu item, I'd definitely come back for it. CUPCAKES: They had two flavors available on my visit, both had a moist cake and a rich filling. Frostings weren't too sweet, and was clearly real butter cream. An indulgent end to a heavy meal, but so worth the calories.   Service was attentive and friendly throughout our visit, making recommendations and providing constant refills. Location is new and clean, buffet area for lunch looks large. Chef came out toward the end of our meal, told us about his background and thanked us for our visit. Looking forward to coming back frequently, location is super convenient."}
{"text":"Flavorful food and friendly staff. The chef/owner greeted each table and was very pleasant. There are still some finishing touches that need to be done to the restaurant decor/signage, but overall this place is worth a try. We found the price for the lunch buffet very fair. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! My husband and I went there on a date in Sunday and we're back again on Wednesday...just found out he's there again tonight! I cannot say enough about the food!!! Fresh homemade and tastes incredible! Best yet in Vegas! The chef and owner is very kind and takes great pride in his food and it shows! He even will make dietary changes for you and visits our table to see if everything taste good. The service is equally on par with the quality of the food. They even have an Indian kids menu, kid friendly options with a taste of India so they can try something more worldly than Mac and cheese!We have had Jose as our server every time and he is a pleasure and super knowledgable about the food and menu! He's funny and personable and takes great care with his customers. We are so glad Paradise India is in the neighborhood, looks like we will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"OVER PRICED. Papads were burnt. Poori was horrible.  Now coming to the good part. Options were good. Food was tasty. Goat biryani was very good. Curries were tasting good but were spicy. Service was good and they helped in giving me hot water for my infant."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant based on the many positive comments and all I can say is, I would never return to this establishment.   The restaurant appearance was satisfactory. Nothing special. We were coming to eat at the buffet and were seated at a table where I couldn't see the person sitting across from me because of the glare coming from the window. I asked to move to a different table. We were moved to a booth with a view of the kitchen and end of the buffet line. I am a thin person and could barely squeeze into the seat. Let's put it this way...I could not get a napkin on my lap because the table came one inch from my ribs!  The food....  I have never been to an indian buffet that did not serve samosas. That was disappointing. There was chutney available with a wilted salad but other than the small amount of salad on ice there were no appetizers. There was plain white rice that did not taste like the normal basmati....probably plain uncle ben type rice. The vegetarian options were chana masala which was fair. The only discerning flavor was pepper. I like hot but there was no flavor of cumin, cardimun curry or tumeric....just hot, I'd give it a 4. The potato curry dish was ok...again nothing special. All you could taste was black pepper. There was a paneer vegetable dish that had no vegetables except mushrooms (of which I've never eaten mushrooms in indian food before). Usually this dish is made with cauliflower and potatoes and the sauce was ok but there were no vegetables. I got this dish right after they put it on the buffet. It seemed they were trying to save money by just serving sauce! The dal was ok. I can say the nan was good (we requested plain instead of the garlic). The food on the buffet was mostly empty and not particularly hot. Most indian buffets serve kheer (rice pudding) and it was disappointing not to have kheer. There was a bread pudding that was pretty much the absolute grossest thing I have ever tasted. They were sooooo bad I had to spit it out into my napkin. Same thing with the desert balls gulab jamun.... so horrible!  We will never return to this restaurant. Everything about this lunch experience made it a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Finally a proper Indian place. The chicken biryani with mid lvl spice is meant for people from India. If you are not accustomed to eating indian food please do ask for low spice. This place is legit!   There was very less chicken in the biryani. Hence the 4 out of five.   I also had the buffet which was just like any other place, decent options for both veg and non veg. Good real indian food with real spices. I guess its new so they have not americanized it. Hopefully they wont but it almost always seems to happen."}
{"text":"I have tasted every indian buffet in Vegas. Coming from England I am an aficionados in indian food. This is a great deal with amazing flavour. The chicken tikka has an incredible flavour"}
{"text":"Wife and I have traveled all over the world and often eat Indian food.    I would write a review of this place but I am simply lost for words.  It's surprisingly the best Indian ever.  And we find it at home in Vegas.   You guys are amazing!"}
{"text":"Paradise India is a must go to if you have been in search of authentic Indian cuisine in Las Vegas. Chef William serves up authentic dishes and flavors, while using the most fresh ingredients. We have tried so many dishes on the menu and we have enjoyed them all. Chef William and his staff are warm and welcoming. Thank you to them for bringing a great taste of India to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome yummy food! From veggie to the meat dishes, it was way above par! I'm not a fan of eating Indian food outside, Bc I get amazing Indian food at home already, but this place was the best second choice."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, which I think reading other reviews is their slow time as they have a very fairly priced lunch buffet. When we walked into Paradise India the first though I had was it was an extremely large space with only a few people dining. Although this isn't a great atmosphere for a small dinner, I can imagine that a giant party or wedding would be a lot of fun at this location. We were immediately seated in front of a booth that made watching the Bollywood movie on the screen the center of our experience and I enjoyed it immensely.   They don't have lamb korma which is a bummer! I had a mango lassi to drink and we split garlic naan, lamb kashmiri rogan josh, and lamb kadai. Everything was well cooked and tasted good. Although the presentation made it seem as if the portions weren't very big, my boyfriend and I still had a hard time finishing.   I think this is a family owned restaurant, which I like. Two teenage girls were our main servers and they were shy but very sweet. Again, I need to come try their lunch buffet I think that is their peak."}
{"text":"This restaurant had many dishes to choose from & everything was flavorful. The vegetable korma is my favorite dish.   The garlic naan is made fresh to order even though it was a buffet. It was amazing. The price is very reasonable.   I will definitely be back and I'd like to try dinner here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Indian restaurant, with very flavorful food. William, the chef and owner, is dedicated to his customers wants them to be happy healthy and successful! The dahl is very flavorful, all of the dishes are excellent. Come over and try it out you won't be sorry! The prices are reasonable, service is great."}
{"text":"First, my stars are for the food. It was excellent. Very flavorful!  HOWEVER, this place is not going to last. On a Friday night, no one was in the restaurant. Even the former Bachi burger joint couldn't survive in that location. Paradise India should have a smaller place with more people traffic.  Doubt I will be back, just because I saw the Chef leave and duck into the fitness gym after I left."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since it popped up on my radar. I love Indian food and I'm always trying to find different ones to eat at. This place had a few issues.   First, they should update their hours to show that they are closed before 5pm, not sure what time they open for lunch though which was annoying because I came at 4 and I was disappointed to see they were closed, however I don't take that into account when I rated them. I left and did something else and came back an hour later. I walked in at 5:05 and the waitress (young white woman with red lipstick)  was talking to another worker and it took her a few seconds to acknowledge us. She sat us down and didn't seem to know much about their menu and did not seem very happy to be there. The restaurant was completely empty, but there were many smears on our glass tabletop and when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, there was paper towels and trash on the floor. Our food came out about 30 mins after we ordered (lamb tandoori and kids burger and fries) and the lamb chops were under seasoned and a bit dry tbh. I was very disappointed. I had to ask for rice with it because she forgot to bring it out the first time I asked her. I was really annoyed at this point because I wanted to get some cupcakes for my kid (which were in a display close by) and she said their pastry chef was out of town for a few weeks. Like, why even display those if ur pastry chef is gone for that long??   The kids burger patty was hard and not juicy at all and the fries were limp. The portion for the lamb was average as I took leftovers home, although I had to get up and try to find her to ask for a box, as at this point I hadn't seen her for 10 mins after I was done eating. The mango lassi was amazing though!! Tart, sweet and perfect consistency.   The other waitress who was there today (and a tall biggish guy who didn't introduce himself-maybe he was the owner?) were super nice though.   There is nothing worse than seeing a place with amazing reviews and having a less than average experience."}
{"text":"The service and the food was excellent!! I love that they had a buffet, everything was delicious. I'm a huge Tikka Masala fan and there's was awesome. They had bread pudding as well which I've never had at an Indian restaurant and it was wicked!! Very rich and sweet with yummy flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here. Friendly staff and nice location.  I love Indian food and I brought my parents here for their first Indian food experience. We got several different things to try a lot of the menu. It was all delicious. We are all happy with the food and experience. The owner/cook even came out to check on what we thought. He was very kind and we appreciated him coming to say hello.  I would come here again soon if I weren't just here on vacation.  I would recommend this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I just had a feeling this was going to be a great experience. It smelled awesome. It looked awesome. The staff was super friendly and attentive.   My husband and I ordered the chicken curry and the tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken was a beautiful ruby red and the chicken curry was just spiced so deliciously. We also had garlic naan that was super good too.   We were born really pleased with the service and the level of quality of the food. We will be returning"}
{"text":"We tried the buffet. Expensive and insipid. Only their goat curry was good . Rest everything was absolutely tasteless. This is not how Indian food tastes. Never going back again."}
{"text":"We came in after seeing the sign a couple days ago for lunch and the food was excellent!  We enjoyed every single dish as they were were very flavorful and definitely the best Indian we have had here. The nan melts in your mouth and everything was very fresh! The bread pudding was also an unexpected surprise! The Chef/owner also came to each table to make sure the guests were happy which was so nice to see! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place receives such rave reviews. The service is terrible, the food sucks - at least during their buffet times. Sure, they have a chicken tikka masala dish but there was no chicken in it. They bring you one naan out at a time during the buffet and for three people that doesn't go very far. They bring out one napkin per person at a time and for a place you're mostly eating with your hands, that's just being cheap. For the price, go to the Mt Everest buffet instead."}
{"text":"I was driving along after grocery shopping a bit further away from my usual stomping grounds when I peeked in my rear-view mirror and could have sworn I saw Paradise Indian food at Cimarron and Sahara. I took a turn left and walked up to the door but it was locked with no operating hours in the door. It was 4:00 PM and I was rendered forlorn. I yelped the place and called them and they told me Paradise would be open at 5 PM for dinner. I was relentless and I found some nearby stores as a distraction and returned promptly at 5 to find the door still locked. Another couple was waiting for the place to open. They knocked on the window and  the door opened around 5:10. I walked into a large space with an unfinished bar and plenty of seating. The hostess/waitress told me they had been open since June. I was shocked, looked at the menu, and ordered some traditional favorites to go. I don't know what's actually going on here but the lamb Korma was amazing. Spices just right along with true basmati rice, lentil soup (delish) and garlic nan. Not by any means cheap but portions were full of excellently prepared good that stayed fresh until I got home and consumed it with vigor. Paradise Indian is worth a visit and they have a lunch buffet which I will try in the future. Really, the food was quite fantastic. Now add some sitar music and make it a home. Well done!  Stick around!"}
{"text":"I had the best lamb chops I've ever had in my life here!!! Out of 50+ restaurants' lamb chops I've had, this was THE BEST.  I saw one of my favorite Yelpers wrote a review on this place. WHAT?! She rated this restaurant 5 star?! She rarely leaves 5 star reviews unless it's some kind of events or in another states, usually 4 stars for even great restaurants in Vegas. I said to my self \"in order for her to rate this place 5 stars, THIS PLACE HAS TO BE FREAKING AWSOME.\"  I had errands to do at the night, but I dropped everything and headed over to restaurant myself. I called before I got to this place to make sure they have \"The lamb special\".   When this special lamb chop came out on a sizzling iron skillet, everybody in the restaurant turned their heads towards this dish. The guy sitting behind me came over and asked me \"Hey, what's that? That looks good.\" The smell of it was so amazing. I knew this was going to be delicious just from looking at it.   It was perfectly seasoned, cooked and prepared. I've had so many smelly, fatty, disgusting lamb chops at so many restaurants (even at a super expensive restaurant) but the lamb chops here are so tender, lean, juicy, flavorful and awesome. FREAKING AWSOME!! The sauce that came with it was nice and spicy. They brought out this sauce 5 minutes before the lamb came out. I tasted it with the spoon. \"OMG, I could drink this sauce like a soup!!\" It was warm and spicy. Tasted so addicting. I seriously wanted to take this sauce home to go, but I didn't.   The owner chef, William Bathini came out from the kitchen. He asked me how I found this place. I pulled out the printed Yelp page from my purse and showed him the paper. (Yes I print out Yelp pages before I visit new restaurants. I'm old fashioned.) He really didn't know about Yelp... He didn't know his own restaurant receiving 11 solid 5 star reviews... (Oh, my.) I told him how amazing his lamb chops were. He told me that Steve Adams and the team mates from OKC Thunder (basketball) used to come to his restaurant and order \"9 dishes each\" of his lamb chops. (Wowza.) I believe it. I could have eaten 2 dishes probably. It was that good. Yes.  I also ordered Garlic naan. It was nice and fresh but I'm not gonna get in to it. I don't want my reviews to be super long. The lam chops really blew my mind. Comer after 5 pm and try their lamb special!! It doesn't say anywhere but they close from 3 pm to 5 pm. Again, I could have never never found this place without Yelp. I love finding out new restaurants through my favorite Yelpers. Love food, love Yelp and love my fave reviewers!!"}
{"text":"Just came with my family to have a Indian Buffet today and it was one of the best in the town. not only the flavorable food but also, the Service and the friendly staff made our day better. two chefs Raj and Williams know what they doing and most food are right on the money. i really dont want to write a page about their food, you must try it and feel how good they are"}
{"text":"My parents an I are Indian... when there is a new indian restaurant in town we will be the first ones there! We came for their weekday lunch buffet for $9.99 a person and it was absolutely amazing. The owner and his staff are super friendly and know the menu really well. The food is so fresh and delicious. I would definitely recommend the butter chicken which is super tasty. Plus, William offers gourmet cupcakes and soon some fresh juices! Not to mention the super comfortable and spacious seating. The restaurant has a very nice layout and a classic, clean, modern design. I would definitely come here again for the great environment, prices, and food!"}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet only.    My group of 6 showed up at 11:30.  We possibly could have had 10+.  So we picked a place & time that could accommodate us if we swelled up to 10+.  As it turned out, the others were too hung over to join us for lunch... thanks to the iHeartRadio Festival.  So we stayed a party of 6.   Right at opening, we were the only ones there.  So, we were greeted and seated immediately.  I noticed right away the lack of scents.  Maybe the food wasn't ready??  But oh no, the food was already in the warming trays and we were invited to partake.  Hmmm...not sure I wanted to.  But, we were already there.  So...  I got a smattering of everything to try.  There wasn't much...goat curry, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, chili chicken, about 4 vegetarian dishes, & salad.  The waitress brought us a basket of regular naan & a basket of garlic naan.  They were warm & delicious.  The rest of the food though was rather lackluster.  There was no depth of flavors that I've come to expect from Indian food.   The spices were very subtle and left me unsatisfied.   Those cupcakes that everyone else had raved about should make up for some of that dissatisfaction, right?  I saw some behind a case and asked our waitress how/if we could have some.  She said no.  Those were just for display and that the chef no longer makes/offers cupcakes.  Then why display it and tease me like that?!?!  Not cool :/  To make things worse, the chef stormed out of the kitchen at the end of our meal and reprimanded an employee  for mislabeling the food.  That was an uncomfortable moment.  My aunt actually pulled the chef aside and told him that that was an inappropriate way to handle the situation.  The chef agreed and apologized.  He explained that he has had trouble with this particular employee for months and has had enough.   Let's recap...lackluster food, no cupcakes, employee drama, & $13.99/person.  Other reviewers paid $9.99 just a few weeks ago...higher price on weekends???  Who knows.  Didn't bother to find out.  We won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh, and flavorful food. Probably the freshest (which is a big deal) Indian food I have had in Las Vegas. I was served by the owner himself, who was extremely cordial and friendly. I will most definitely be returning soon. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and ordered ala carte . Good varities of Authentic indian dishes and the food  has good flavour for most of the curries. I ordered samosas and they were so crispy and yummy. Chicken biryani is must a try . Ambience is neat and Service is excellent . The price is little expensive but overall I would give a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Shame to call a restaurant. Ate a buffet last week.overly priced and they force gratuity. No host. Initially I was not even sure if they were open. Basic spoon/bowl/forks/napkin missing. We were given one cheap $0.99 napkin/tissue per person and had to keep asking for more. Appetizers half cooked. Vegetarian options are minimal. Basic entree using paneer is not even part of a single dish. Food is too spicy. Desserts are a joke. Rice pudding is boiled milk and rice served. Only other option was bread pudding quality poor. thought it was an Indian cuisine. Their Falooda is sugar syrup with milk and bits of noodles. Where was the icecream??? This is the worst Indian food I have ever eaten.u have to constantly keep asking people to put food at buffet as they never have everything together despite there being bare minimal people. I don't even want to Imagine what would be the plight during a busy day. As a person who cooks decent Indian food and enjoys it this was an extremely bad experience."}
{"text":"Among the best Indian buffets in Vegas, especially the dessert offerings!  The chicken and veggie buffet items were all flavorful and well-spiced, but I didn't see any goat or lamb (darn) dishes at the time I went for lunch.  It was the kheer and thin, chewie brownies though that made my day!  With no gulab jamun in sight (double darn), I needed to mix my kheer with something, and those chocolate brownies dunked into that smooth, milky rice pudding had me returning for seconds and thirds even though I was almost bursting full from sampling all the curry entrees as well as the basket of complimentary naan!  The very nice waitresses were quick to refill my water and provide extra napkins. I also really liked the fact that forks, spoons, and knives were readily available when you're going to get a new plate for more helpings.  Will return ASAP!"}
{"text":"We went with friends because I had received an email from Yelp about new restaurants in my area and we were very disappointed.  We went early on a Saturday evening and we were the only ones in the place.  We ordered what we usually eat and while the Chicken Tikka Masala was tasty the Lamb Vindaloo was missing potatoes which have always been included anywhere we ever ate this dish.  Not a place I would choose to go back to."}
{"text":"We went to Paradise India for dinner. At first we were worried because the crowd was small (apparently it's more of a lunch spot). However, the food was amazing, particularly the chicken korma. Additionally the hosts were lovely. We will be back. Side note: I'd take down the Pepsi signs to attract a dinner crowd. The 'OPEN BAR' sign is gold."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Vegas!!!!   Chef/Owner is a super nice guy and makes amazing Korma, tikka Masala, and Briyani.  His bread pudding was amazing too.  Our server was wonderful as well.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this restaurant. It was amazing for Valentine's Day. Don't miss your chance to dine here! The owner greeted us personally. He was very helpful and suggested menu items that were very delicious. He went above and beyond to accommodate us. The service was friendly and attentive. The food was aromatic, hot and tasty. It was the best Indian food I've had in a long time! I especially recommend this restaurant to vegetarians. Although, I think a meat eater would be very pleased as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! Been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, we live very close and there are no Indian places nearby. Went to check it out, opened 4 weeks ago.  Not the fanciest place, bit drab decor wise, but clean and tidy.  Were greeted right away and shown to table.  Drinks followed shortly after.  Subtle music playing and traditional Bollywood film showing on the television. We got vege pakoras and chicken tika which was served sizzling.  Sauces were delicious, very addictive. Chef owner came to check on us and introduce himself, wanted feedback, we loved everything. Entrees were chicken curry and chicken tiki masala, yummy best tiki masala have ever had, so creamy and delicious. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have been lost without William since his W Sahara location shut down.  Had to pay him a visit at his lovely new store.  I had the lunch special of Chicken korma AND chicken tikka masala, served with rice and the coolest lookin naan bread ever.  I asked for a 7 spice level and he delivered, so authentic tasting.  Johan had a chicken curry and a 10 spice level, William made it by scratch for him and I have to tell you Johan loved it, every mouthful saying, yeah that's it. Will have to make this a weekly visit now.  If you want traditional Indian food made with love then you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp! saves lunch. Some days I just want to try something new. I'll jump on and look for something close. Today I found Paradise India and so happy I did!  The space is large and open, it was actually almost empty when I walked in though it filled up shortly after. They have a weekday lunch buffet that was very reasonable at $10.99. I love this as it allowed me to try many dishes for a first shot. Everything was excellent!  Now I don't know all the names of the dishes and I don't feel like standing over the sneeze guard to take notes but I tried it all and literally everything was good. The Tikka Masala was great as was a chickpea and spinach dish. I'm coming back with more appetite and putting a hurt in these people next time lol.  Come check this place out, I sent out 3 texts while I was eating."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had!!!! Must try the chicken tikka masala! Truly out of this world. Staff is friendly and helpful. The chef even came out to our table to see how we were doing!"}
{"text":"Just knocking off one of the flavor cuisines on my mental list of international appetite-ness (credits to mio bello on that) :P  This menu is a bit different. There is a section for Indo-Chinese.  The selections we ordered were perfect in flavor. Not too spicy. And they ask how we want it. It was highly satisfying food.   The service is really pleasant. Their restaurant can take private parties. The space is huge.  I couldn't stop staring at the umbrellas on the ceiling. I actually think they need more :P Awesome water fountain wall at the entrance.  Suggestions: mango lassi, any of their curries, and biryani!"}
{"text":"My dad was raving about how good the lunch buffet was here (whenever he hypes up a place, it usually ends up being disappointing) and so I didn't expect too much.  It was a lot better than I expected.  Food: 4 stars Service: 5 stars  Came here for lunch on a Saturday. It was pretty empty, but I bet it gets pretty busy on Sundays, especially after church. Buffet is $9.99 on weekdays, and $13.99 on weekends.   Good variety of items. The highlights were the goat curry, chicken tandoori, chicken korma, the chicken tikka masala, and the garlic naan. What I was most impressed about, however, was the service. Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, and our waitress was accommodating to our unending requests of garlic naan (we probably had like 6 baskets of garlic naan lol).   Looking forward to our next visit here. We'll definitely have to check out their dinner as well."}
{"text":"As authentic as Indian Food can get. Not very Americanized (if at at all). Love that the chef is actually from India and schooled there. Great variety of Indian dishes.   I have had the pleasure of eating real Indian food from my time out there, and this place is somewhere I return to every time I crave for Indian food.  Want a taste of India and the different cuisines from different regions? This is the place to experience it!   Chalo!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Talk about authentic Indian food the same way my mother does. I highly recommend the food here."}
{"text":"Okay, I rarely leave reviews, but I have to say a few words about this place.  My husband and I are always looking for delicious Indian food at a reasonable price-- This place is it!!!  I read a few reviews of this place and we decided to try it.  We walked in near closing time, wanting to order some takeout on the way home from the kids' soccer practice.  The chef/owner was closing up and seemed ready to leave.  I almost turned around and walked out before we ordered, but the chef insisted that he was happy to take our order and he turned the grill back on and made our food.  I was impressed.  Then when he brought the food out to us, he explained that he is a chef-- not a cook-- and that he takes a lot of pride in his work. He confidently claimed that this was going to be one of the best Indian meals we've ever had.  Boy, was he right.  My husband couldn't even wait until we got home to try the food.  The moans and groans of delight as he stuck his fork inside one of the boxes, let me know that I was in for a treat.  We ordered the chicken tikka, lamb biryani, palak paneer and a few other things.  Absolutely fresh and delicious.  And get this?  They have a weekday lunch buffet for $10!!  Perfection.  The chef/owner is new to Vegas from D.C.-- do yourself a favor and support this business.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg! I have visited probably every Indian restaurant in town, and Mint Indian Bistro was my favorite, but Paradise surely gave them a run for their money. I don't typically like buffets, but this was fresh, beautiful and served by the owner and chef Himself! My boyfriend has declared it his new favorite restaurant.  We will go again, for lunch and dinner. Don't pass up their Chana masala,  it's Divine! And their garlic Naan? Don't get me started!  I have found my buffet. Great Job!"}
{"text":"I had Paradise India bookmarked for a while, and decided to check it out for lunch after getting a haircut. The restaurant is fairly large, and was about half-occupied when I visited. Decor is simple, but the place is clean and presentable.   Paradise India offers a lunch buffet, even on weekends, which I opted for. The price is a little higher for weekend lunch buffet ($14.99, compared to $10.99 on weekdays), but I overheard one of the waitresses telling another patron that the weekend lunch includes an extra row of dishes on the buffet.  I opted for garlic naan, which did not cost extra. The naan was made fresh and very tasty, and I'm sure I could have asked for more, but one basket was sufficient (since I also had some rice from the buffet).   The food itself was very tasty. I liked the spread of dishes, and some items that stood out to me (because I don't see them in buffets often) were the okra dish and eggplant dish. Once again, chilli chicken made an appearance on the buffet, which continues to support my theory that Vegas Indian buffets like to include this Indo-Chinese dish; I had never seen this dish when dining at Indian buffets in California or Virginia (though Indo-Chinese dishes were very common when I was actually in India).  There were also three desserts, more than I expected. I would have appreciated some fresh fruit as well, and maybe some samosas or pakora in addition to the puri so I had more to dip in the tamarind and mint chutneys.   Nonetheless, I thought the food was great and the service excellent. My waitress checked on me regularly, and refilled my water multiple times. I definitely agree that Paradise India is one of the better buffets in Vegas, though will have to come back to try food off their regular menu!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 2.5 stars. The service was great. This is my second time coming here and I wanted to try this place again because I was really contemplating if I liked it the first time. The decor is nice and everything looks clean. I get my plate and notice it was dirty. Strike one. Get my utensils and there was something on my knife. Okay... On to the food. The buffet doesn't have a large assortment like the other buffets I'm used to. It's okay, less items, the food quality should be better? I take a bite into my tandoori chicken and it's cold. Hmm... I ask him if his chicken is cold, and he says kind of. I had him take a bite of my chicken and he says it's cold. It was almost as if it was in the refrigerator. Gross. I just wasn't impressed with the food, it seemed like it wasn't warm enough or it felt like something was lacking. Usually, we get two plates of food. This time, we barely finished our first plate. Also, they don't have your samosas or saag paneer either at the buffet which makes me sad. I honestly don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the food.  The dish I wanted was not on the menu but the chef accommodated our request."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best Indian food restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is amazing here. I have gone to other Indian restaurants in Vegas and it does not compare to the rest of the Indian restaurants in Vegas. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, food is delicious , beautiful presentation loved it.  Hands down THE BEST, most authentic Indian food in Vegas. The curries & spices are incredible. chicken tandoori & tikka masala, are to die for. Garlic & onion naan is delish.  Seriously one of my best Indian food experience!!! You can't go wrong with that place!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not THE best indian food restaurant in town (imo). Delicious food, clean place, very friendly staff and attentive owner/chef. For lunch they have an all-you-can-eat buffet with an array of Indian dishes. There are onion fritters that are crunchy fresh and perfectly seasoned. Fragrant basmati rice. Flavorful and generously spiced curry dishes. Vegetarian and vegan options.   The place has a pleasant atmosphere and gives off more of a modern cultural vibe, probably because of all the Indian pop music videos playing on TV screens. It can be quite mesmerizing!   Dinner menu is more elaborate, so I definitely recommend giving this place a try for dinner.  Perhaps the only little improvement I would request is to mark dishes better as far as vegan vs vegetarian vs non-vegetarian. But they are pretty responsive when you just ask them.  Great place and I can't wait to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Would be nice if they posted the correct business hours on yelp... came all the way down here just to realize they're closed from 3 to 5  I came because it said \"open now\" which it wasn't."}
{"text":"First time there food was excellent and varied for a buffet style lunch. Can't wait to try them for dinner. Chef/owner William very attentive. I would definitely  recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The lunch Buffet was an amazing dining experience of the best Indian cuisine we have ever tasted. The food was tantalizing and exploding with flavor! The ambience was beautiful and the service was great. This is a must go to place. Check it out as they have only been open for 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Met the owner and asked him to surprise us.  Chicken Korma. Chicken Chilly.  Best surprise ever."}
{"text":"This new Indian restaurant is only about four miles from home.  With the increase in people from India living in Las Vegas, a number of new Indian restaurants have opened near my neighborhood so that I don't have to go to the university area to enjoy Indian cuisine.  I came here today for the lunch buffet.  At $9.99, it's a good deal.  I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant and brought water and the mango lassi I ordered.  I then went up to make my first choices.  The silverware is at the area where you pick up your plate so I got that, took it back to the table, and then went to look at the food.    A cursory look showed me that most of the dishes were vegetarian and so that's what I chose for my first plate.  Outstanding things for the first plate were the chana masala, palak paneer, and dal tadka. The chana masala and palak paneer had a nice spiciness to them, and I am a big fan of dal in almost all forms.  I went to the end of the buffet for naan.  I was disappointed in it because it was somewhat rubbery from sitting in the warming tray and the first piece had no butter taste to it at all.  In addition, the end of this particular piece was thick like a slice of pizza.  It made it impossible to rip off a piece to grab some dal.  Instead I had to use my fork.  For the second plate, I got some goat biryani, chicken korma, and onion fritters.  The goat was so so.  Nothing I'd get again.  The chicken korma had a good flavor but again trying to get a piece of naan to wrap around one of the chicken pieces was next to impossible.  The onion fritters were more like dipped onion rings in thick bread batter rather than what one normally thinks of when you see the word fritter.  For dessert I tried two things--bread pudding and rice flour halvah.  They were both interesting and something new.  The bread pudding was more moist and soft than what one normally thinks of bread pudding.  The better of the two was the halvah which was quite good and different from anything I've had before.  I did look for gulab jamun but there were none.  I didn't want a cupcake so this ended the lunch on a sweet note.  The deal breaker for me is the naan.  I have been to no lunch buffet in the area where the naan is left cut in a heating pan to keep warm.  Naan should be fresh and brought out when it's ready.  The buffet consisted mainly of vegetarian dishes which is OK.  There were 3 meat dishes--chicken korma, goat biryani, and tandoori chicken.    I will try this place for an evening meal but I'll go elsewhere for a lunch buffet.  NOTE:  I got a communication from the chef/owner of Paradise India this evening explaining that some staff didn't show up for work today and that is why he put the naan on the buffet.  It is never his way of doing things as he was host and cook today.  This explains a lot and it gives me faith that my next visit will be more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Wow this was really good the buffet was amazing. I wish they had Somosa but that's ok. The waiter was very nice greeted me with a smile and was very on top of keeping my water filled. This place is 1.2 miles from my house and the buffet for lunch is only 13.99. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Not quite the substitute for my normal Indian food haunt...  I found Paradise India really just OK.  I normally go to an Indian buffet that is literally on the same street of Sahara but a few miles away.  I thought Paradise India would be a good change in case I got tired of the other one.  But...I don't know about that.  Wifey and I had a lunch date on a Friday so we decided to visit Paradise India.  Upon entering, we were surprised that the place wasn't busy like the other Indian buffet we go to.  There were maybe only 4 or 5 tables taken.  Place was quiet!  Where is the TV?  Where is the Bollywood music & dancing?  It was like you could hear a pin drop.  Took a few minutes to get seated because no one was at the front near the entrance.  And once we did get seated there was no silverware near the plates so we had to wait for the basket to be refilled.  At the usual Indian buffet I frequent, every time I enter there is always the smells of spices, bread, something wafting in the air.  Is it my mistake that at Paradise India they had none of that?  For Indian curries/stews, don't most of them take a ton of time to make?  Hmmm...made me wonder, any of the stuff on the buffet line actually made FRESH today??  I'm no expert on Indian food but something was just...OFF.  I suspect my freshness meter was somewhat correct.  Almost everything tasted FLAT, like no burst of flavor or spices like I get from other Indian food I've tasted.  The flavors were muted, like these were leftovers from yesterday.  I of course can't prove that but the excitement of enjoying the spice just wasn't there.  It was all kinda MEH.  Chicken Tikka Masala was really kind of plain, the Tandoori Chicken was near cold and was dry.  The Spinach & Cheese was very lackluster, barely any flavor.  The Goat Biryani was OK but parts of the rice were either undercooked or had been sitting around the heat too long.  And really, where the HELL are the samosas?  I'm not trying to be funny, I like me some samosas with chutney or tamarind sauce!  Thought they would be standard fare.  Most disappointing for me?  The naan bread!!  Why didn't each table get a fresh baked basked of naan bread included with their buffet meal??  It was sitting on the buffet line instead...more limp than Ron Jeremy after party.  Just kinda SAD.  It was no fun trying to dip almost rubbery naan bread into lifeless entrees.  At that point we just ate to get a meal in.  The chef/owner approached us and asked us how everything was...and I mean I just couldn't.  I couldn't tell him it was all very bland for me...maybe it was an off day?  Maybe the regular cook was out?  I just don't know.  So we just kinda told him it was pretty good and left it at that.  We enquired about the cupcakes, which are strange because well...not many Indian places actually serve CUPCAKES.  They looked pretty but we were taken aback when we found out each one was like $3 I think.  I kinda figured one would be included with the buffet meal but that's OK.  Perhaps we'll try them on another visit?  If we do indeed visit again...  Price was on par with other Indian buffets in the area, at $9.99 per person plus tax.  Service for us was very slow though, took a while for plates to be cleared and water to be refilled.  It's probably because a server is hardly ever present in the dining area, ours kept only going back and forth to the kitchen, mainly staying in the kitchen.    Sorry Paradise India, thought you would be a welcome alternative to our usual Indian haunt...but I guess we'll have to stay with them for now to get our Indian fix.  Keep trying!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot for Indian food because everything is fresh prepared.  So if I want to remove some spices from my food, like cumin seeds (which are junk because they irritate the digestive tract), then it's no big deal. Almost all the other Indian places in town premix things several days in advance which means the food at these other places isn't truly fresh.  I also like the variety of choices on the menu and it's also rare to find Indian spots with dosa.  Service is very attentive and friendly.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Food was horrendous. Owner was so rude. Started a fight with a customer. He doesn't know how to treat people with respect."}
{"text":"Went to Paradise India for the first time today after friends of mine frm Switzerland recommended it to me. I had the lunch special.  a  Chicken/Korma, Chicken/Curry combination with the best Naan Bread I ever had ! The sauces were rich and so flavorful ! I am so glad I went there and can't to go back !!"}
{"text":"I went for buffet variety was ok service seemed to be slow . Only biryani was the best , rest Chana, pakora, and bread pudding , and naan rest of the buffet I didn't like, it all service looked slow they were slowly refilling and after eating buffet I had bad stomach upset for 2 days"}
{"text":"We went in on a Friday evening and it was pretty slow but the server was very attentive and friendly.  I liked the big screen TV they had playing also.. overall the portions are very good and while I wasn't a fan of the biryani I thought the flavor of the korma was spot on and their rice had a nice subtle flavor too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, atmosphere is great, they serve liquor. I'm impressed with the selection."}
{"text":"Drove out here because the hours listed that it was open at 3:20 pm. Was extremely frustrated to find that despite the hours listed on Yelp, and their own door, the restaurant had a paper sign up reading closed 3-5pm. Extremely frustrated as I drove out of my way to try this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Food and service excellent. Restaurant clean and comfortable.  Highly recommended!! Very accommodating. Owner and staff very pleasant. From Illinois visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever !!!! We went there at 2:50pm before we sit down we asked the server will we be served or should be leave she said no have seat they will serve us right after 5 minutes when we order naan she said their cook has left so no naans !!! Wow!! Really we work somewhere too we know how to do customer service before their shef were left they could ask ppl sitting down does anyone need anything our shefs leaving no1 asked plus customer service girl lied that their shef didn't tell her they are gone wow!! Good Luck"}
{"text":"The wife and I tried this place a couple months ago and are hooked - we've been back 3 times.  Everything is made to order so expect a little wait - but it's worth it.  The food bursts with flavor and is obviously crafted from fresh ingredients.  The only suggestion we have is to please add a sample platter to the menu so that people can try several dishes at once.  We suggested one sample platter with poultry and the other vegetable.  If you already know what you like you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"The review is from a Mothers day lunch at the restaurant. Selected the restaurant based on other glowing reviews. The experience was quite the opposite. The food choices were limited and the quality was bad. Our group left most of the food after tasting it. Will not be visiting again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We visited Paradise in Sep 2016 and all I can say is if you have real taste for Indian food, this place is no short of heaven..... I couldn't thank the chef RAJ enough for his excellent taste... I am someone who is extremely difficult to please especially when it comes to Indian food. Victoria.... A beautiful young lady helped us with everything we needed and definitely added to the hospitality.... The food items at this place are extremely different from most Indian places... Zucchini... Okra...Chilly chicken... Biriyani.... Yum yum... The list just goes on... This place definitely charmed us and we are definitely coming back.... Keep up the quality Paradise...You guys Rock!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  the food is simply AMAZING!!!  I am so glad that I have a delicious Indian restaurant right next to my House!!!  Their buffet is outstanding!!! I will be visiting them with my family every chance I can get!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food will definitely go back once I get back to Vegas Biryani was off the hook thanks."}
{"text":"So happy that there is a great Indian restaurant  that recently opened up in the neighborhood.  I love Indian food and this place more than satisfies the craving.  This is my third time there and the vegetable pakora, shrimp biryani, lamb curry, chicken tandoori, and pistachio desert was delicious.  The atmosphere is clean and classy.  Excellent service.  I hope more people find this place because it's awesome"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight. The service was excellent and the chef was so friendly. You can tell he takes pride in his food because everything was excellent. We had the chicken tikka masala and the \"mild\" sauce was just the perfect amount of spice for us. This is great local spot for awesome Indian food!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Amazing. Best Indian food I've had in Vegas. The owner is also the chef and he came to our table and introduced himself and asked how our meal was. We came for dinner but they also have a lunch buffet that is only $9.99! We will definitely be back for that soon!"}
{"text":"Freaking fantastic. My only other favorite Indian restaurant has been in Auckland, NZ."}
{"text":"Items Tasted: Mango Lassi Pappadum - Tamarind and Mint Chutney Reshmi Kabab Chicken 65 Tandoori Lamb Chops Pav Bhaji - Fried Onions in Gram Flour Batter Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, Raita, Saffron Rice, Garlic Naan Omelet Roti Rasmalai, Gulab Jamun, Sevya  Opened around two months ago in a large corner-space at 8125 West Sahara, Paradise India may seem at first like every similar concept to arrive in areas further East in recent years, but a closer look at the restaurant from William Bathini speaks of a softer, more nuanced side of Indian cuisine that may be just the sort of thing prone to delight fussy West Siders.  Open for both lunch and dinner, the former a bargain Buffet that is claimed to be one of the largest around, Chef Bathini speaks proudly of his heritage when describing an upbringing in one of his country's more traditional States, and having now spent some time in Washington DC furthering his skills in close proximity to some of America's best Indian Fine Dining establishments he hopes to now bring a piece of his home to the city of Las Vegas.  Inspired by tradition and taking steps to preserve the tastes of his homeland with dynamic spicing replacing the aggressive salting and heat that many associate with lesser restaurants, a quick look at Paradise India's menu speaks volumes by way of its relative brevity, the choices divided into omnivorous or meatless options with plenty to choose from, but not so much as to seem as if they are just shooting with buckshot or trying too hard to please.  Ranging from Tandoori and Curry to Biryani with a small Indo-Chinese section plus a few esoteric items speaking to regional influence, appetizers at Paradise range $5-10 and although the sampling was somewhat limited it is safe to say that fans of Poultry are likely to be happy whether they choose the  elegant Reshmi Kabab that sees tender Chicken breast wrapped around a mild Ginger and Onion filling or the more robust \"Chicken 65\" that eats something like a hand-breaded nugget upgraded by Turmeric, Cumin, Garlic and Red Chilies.  Having already gained praise for the Lamb Chops, a clay oven preparation that presents four bones full of meat on sizzling skillet with onions and peppers for $25, suffice it to say that as good as these are Vegetarians will not feel left out since the traditional Pav Bhaji may be even better as the spicy Onion stew is presented with griddled bread in sizable portion that is as delicious as it is hearty.  Acknowledging the need to please American palates, but not willing to compromise tradition by straying from the path, Bathini's Tandoori Chicken offers tender meat just barely clinging to the bones that it is served with, and although Tikka Masala and Korma are both offered elsewhere the texture of Paradise India's base comes across more subtle and creamy, the choice of whether to use Rice or Bread left to the diner, though those interested in something different are strongly encouraged to try the fluffy Omelet Roti that finds favorable comparison to a thin Spanish Torta.  Continuing the traditional approach with desserts, even the sold-out Bread Pudding apparently common in India due to ancient Persian influence, Gulab Jamun proved a bit too 'gummy' compared to previous experiences with the small Donuts in Honey while the Rasmalai and Sevya were each striking in their subtlety, the latter placing long-grain Rice in the context of a Pudding while the former was almost savory with fresh Paneer soaked in Cream, Fruit plus Nuts and a texture somewhere between Greek Yogurt and Cheesecake.  ****Taking an approach that neither Casinos nor Off-Strip Restaurants seem ready to embrace, the idea of upscale Indian cuisine focused on authenticity rather than the 'American' expectation that seems to embrace tongue tingling heat and too much salt, Paradise India has started on good footing that should only improve as the recipes become fine-tuned and the word spreads."}
{"text":"$9.99 lunch buffet, it was ok for the price. It was very nice place. I might go back again."}
{"text":"If you haven't dined here, you're missing out on something truly special.  Every dish takes me right back to childhood growing up on Indian cooking, dinners around the table with our Indian friends.  William's dishes are on point and exactly what I remember. His dishes make me feel like I'm back home, I can envision the platters and dishes used to serve our meals 20+ years ago.  We have never been disappointed here. And partner is always just staring at me as savoring every heavenly bite with sparkly eyes and child like excitement.  I've heard of a couple of good places in Las Vegas for Indian dining.For me, everything is so spot on point here that I have no desire to search any further or try any other places!  I love Paradise India."}
{"text":"The worst indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Food was horrible. We were treated so bad by the owner and the staff. Such a bad Indian food experience. I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Very delicious Indian food! Authentic and aromatic cuisine. I tried many of the vegetarian options and let me tell you, yumm!! The best for me was the Chana Saag, chickpeas and spinach in a delicious sauce. Also the naan bread was amazing! Oh and please try the mango lasse. Best I have ever had. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is our second Indian buffet in Vegas. We understand that some people like the food spicy, but we don't so it was perfect for us. There was a good variety of food including a selection of vegetarian dishes. The staff was friendly and attentive. I especially enjoyed the sautéed zucchini and the mango creme with fruit. We will be back."}
{"text":"Paradise India is the most authentic Indian food I've ever eaten, period. You don't have to buy a plane ticket to India and on top of that spend more money on a hotel; just eat at Paradise India. I've even noticed my digestive tract health improve with eaten this great vegan Indian food as well."}
{"text":"Decent Indian buffet but could be improved. On the positive side, the server was super friendly. The dishes are spicier than at most Indian restaurants which tend to water things down for us Americans. I really liked their version of chanamasala. Good flavor for most of the curries.   Things to improve on: - Buffet items not kept hot enough. - The rice used is of poor quality, short or broken grains and dry. Really missed fluffy hot basmati rice. - No Indian desserts. No kheer or gulabjamen.  We gave it a try as it is close by but would rather drive further to get a better overall experience in Indian buffet."}
