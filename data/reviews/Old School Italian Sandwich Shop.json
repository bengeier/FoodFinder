{"text":"What a find!  This place is awesome. Me and a buddy tried the Italian beef and the Polpette. Both were top notch sandwiches but if I had to choose, the Polpette was the best. Whatever they do with the peppers there is very unique! I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Old School Italian!!  I can't say enough about this place.  The sandwiches first and foremost, are incredible, it's hard to find this quality of sandwich anywhere.  The people are great, the atmosphere is unique, 5 stars without question.  It's just discrete enough to feel like a secret, but then you eat there and have to tell everyone."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh, hands down! I ordered the classic Italian and it is truly a classic. The owners, Janine and Gina, were fantastic and welcoming. If you visit Pittsburgh, you must check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"Limited choices but the meatball sandwich is great. Simple, classic flavor. Very friendly staff. A bit difficult to find but worth it."}
{"text":"I live in Florida, but my family is from the Pittsburgh area. Every time I'm in town, OSI is a must-have meal. I often crave it when I'm back in the Sunshine state, but there is nothing remotely comparable in my neck of the woods. As an Italian you're not supposed to compare anyone's sauce to your mother's. However; this sauce gives my mom's a run for her money (please don't tell her). The meatballs give a complex flavor profile beyond just ground meat and bread crumbs. Everything I've had off their menu, down to the dessert is what makes this place so special."}
{"text":"Disppointed - I expected more after hearing about this place.  I ordered the $10.99 lunch combo meal - meatball sandwich, salad, drink.  The sandwich was small (4\") with 2 meatballs and a tiny bit of sauce on a soft white roll.  The meatballs were dry and not very tasty.  They left an aftertaste, too.  Not sure about the sauce since there wasn't much of it.  The salad was small and comprised of iceberg lettuce, green peppers, mozzarella cheese and italian dressing (mixed in) served in a cheap stryrofoam dish (that easily tipped over) - nothing exciting about the salad.  They did offer a large bottled water as part of the meal.  The desserts offered were mainly cake - I expected italian pastries at the very least.  The tables/chairs were awkward - your meal on the table was at shoulder level which made it hard to eat.  Parking is alongside the building which was tough, especially if cars were coming.  Service was friendly. Overall, I don't plan on returning - portions were small for the price and the quality of the food was poor."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The restaurant itself is adorable, full of original decor from when the building was an actual school and has lots of cozy spots to sit and enjoy your meal. The owners are super friendly and the service is fast. They clearly love what they do and you can taste it in the food. The meatballs are to die for- so moist and flavorful. The bread is delicious and the portions are just right. The biscotti was the perfect sweet treat to end the meal. I would highly recommend this shop to anyone who loves Italian food (but who doesn't?)!!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, pasta, meatballs I ever had."}
{"text":"Food and employees are great! Only reason keeping it from 5 stars is the limited high style only seating and it was uncomfortably hot inside. They should put a few standard height tables/chairs and a better air conditioner system. Even a window box or portable air conditioner would make it much more comfortable."}
{"text":"The meatball hoagie is the best! Great authentic Italian sauce and meats. Perfect place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Just had a Polpette and an Italian hoagie. Both really delicious and filling. It took a bit of maneuvering around to find this gem but it was worth the search.  The smells of Italian sauce cooking with meatballs is reminiscent of an Italian Kitchen. The owners are so friendly and we even got to sample the beef and the meatballs in sauce while we waited. Both were delicious. The sandwiches are on Breadworks buns and are the perfect compliment to the fillings.  I am looking forward to my return visit to try some of their other offerings.  The chocolate cake looked pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"Family owned Authentic Italian sandwiches in a cool brick building that used to be a school. Italian Beef Sandwich with hot and sweet peppers and chocolate cake were excellent. Gina was super nice and accommodating! Very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location keep you from stopping here - either to grab a bite for lunch or to take dinner home for your family. Excellent home cooked Italian food; hoagies,  pasta and wonderful desserts!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch place! For starters it's extremely convenient for me being located only 1 block away from my home & 1 block away from work! From the minute you walk in you smell authentic Italian, YUM! I've tried everything on the menu (very slim pickings as I'm sure they are trying to establish a broader menu) besides the meatball sandwich. My favorite had to be the Italian beef sandwich. Everything is extremely fresh. Portion sizes could be a little larger, but I'm not one to eat a large lunch anyway. The home made Italian dressing was great, sweeter than your average. Great little mom & pops lunch place nuzzled in the heart of Homestead. Check them out! If your one for cute decor & atmosphere, the place will get you! My only complaint, add more sandwiches so your new established regulars don't get bored :)"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches i ever had. Tender beef and the meatballs, wow. Very down to earth owners."}
{"text":"Great little quick serve sandwich shop. If you are tired of the dreck that is available on the waterfront you should  drive a little bit further and give this place a try. The sandwiches are on the small side but I found them to be the perfect portion for lunch and they are priced well. The bread, peppers and meat are of great quality and I also enjoyed a large slice of their chocolate cake. The shop is located behind a credit union and there is plenty of close street parking on 9th.  You just have to then walk around the church and down a little alley/side street where there lots of signs in the window to direct you."}
{"text":"Friends and I went to a food truck event in Homestead tonight.  I've heard good things about this place and considered trying what they were offering.  The setup was a few tables not a truck.  It started to rain with pretty intense wind.  The tin foil type covers blew off of the trays they were serving on and onto/across the ground.  When it happened my friends and I got showered in sauce from the food and one has considerable stains on his clothes.  The stains aren't the worst part.  The worst part was the workers and patrons running after the covers, picking them up off of the ground, and placing them back on the food they were serving.  GROSS!!!!  The lids swept across the pavement for a good 10 feet then end up back on the food they were serving which is why I highly recommend that you DON'T EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. Always looking for places in area to eat lunch and this is one of the best. Had the shredded beef sandwich and it was great. The staff let us taste the meatballs and ham and both were excellent. I'll skip the fast food and here."}
{"text":"A little disappointed because I expected big things. The location is very tough to find so drive slowly if you are searching for this place. What I liked: Great bread they serve the sandwiches on. Maybe it's baked fresh daily?! The owner/management were nice. Some opportunities to improve include: sandwiches larger than 4 inches. Initially $5.99 sounded like a great value, but I was very underwhelmed when I was handed the sandwich. Out of the three only options that day I had the Italian beef. I didn't enjoy it, though other reviews said it was great. My partners had the meatball and  ham. They both enjoyed theirs, but left a little hungry. The ham I was told, tasted sweet like a holiday ham. You can order a side, though I only saw someone with a salad (chopped lettuce) making your meal come out to $10.99. Suggestions to ownership: because of your location you need to create a buzz about your food. If it's only a 4 inch sub, I need to have my mind blown by how delicious it was. If you create the same taste I can find elsewhere but give me child like portions, I won't tell others to check you out.  I'll check back in 6 months from now to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"Positives - food is very good, atmosphere is great, people are kind. Negative - the sandwich is too darn small.  I ate there at noon and it is 2:30 and I'm starving. They are bigger than a slider, but smaller than a real sandwich.  Maybe offer a \"pick 2\" lunch special?  Idk.    But again, the food is good, just have to figure out the awkward portions."}
{"text":"Go for the food, stay for the entertainment. We stopped in for meatball sandwiches and had a delightful time eating and chatting with the chef/owner.  The meatball sandwich has perfect components- bread, sauce and perfect meatballs. The sweet ham sandwich is also really tasty, and they even let us sample the Italian beef, which was also really good.  Excited to see them open and looking forward to them expanding the menu & space.  Will definitely go back when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"What a great spot in Homestead!  It's tucked away and a bit hard to find at first, but well worth the effort.  It's a simple places, clean on the inside with friendly staff.  They have great homemade Italian style sandwiches.  The meatball sandwich or Italian beef are can't miss.  Highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"Well worthy of 5 stars.   I stopped in today for lunch thanks to searching 'food nearby' after an oil change.  I had The Polpette which had (sauceless) meatballs, garlic seasoned peppers topped with parmesan cheese. It was extremely filling and absolutely delicious.  The shop is in a school building that closed in the 60s. Dining area is in the 1st grade classroom and kitchen is in the former 3rd grade classroom. They kept the cool touches like a chalkboard (the menu is on the board) & exposed brick. Service was friendly.  The shop is a little tricky to locate with Google maps, but once inside you'll enjoy yourself"}
{"text":"I saw this place from the Wendy's Drive -Through and made a detour hoping to get some good homemade food..and I wasn't disappointed.. The Chef/Owners were extremely amiable and welcoming.. I received samples of the food and everything I tried was great .. The Italian Beef Sandwich is hands down the best I've tasted ..Meatballs were so tender and moist and the Ham was sweet and flavorful **!! The negative is that they are located in a one-way alley.. Definitely a hidden gem!! **must try if your in the neighborhood**"}
{"text":"Randomly came here and found the meatball sando to be delicious. Great family atmosphere and vibe. I had forgotten how delicious a great meatball sub is, other spots their meatball subs are too greasy and just falls apart, not this spot."}
{"text":"Great cooked Italian style sandwich meats. Can also order meat over salad for a small up charge. Uses Breadworks bread. Had the ham and the beef so far. Both are fantastic. Sampled the meatballs and they're very good also. Cash only and super friendly. Great addition to Homestead after losing Smoke."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I highly recommend stopping by. A little bit hard to find (be sure to drive around to the rear of the building) but WOW the food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"i hate to let everyone know.....want to keep this a secret. like grandma is in the back cooking!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wooooow what an explosion of yumminess for my taste buds. I'm a native \"munhallian\" but haven't had the pleasure of eating at this magnificent jewel hidden in an alley of homestead. The lady who helped us said it was her family who makes the food and man you can absolutely tell this is home made eating!   They let me sample almost everything and I was soooooo pleased I couldn't choose and got one of each. No joking, the best meatball sandwich Ive ever had! If you're in town and need a quick bite to eat with some homemade loving and great customer service this old school Italian shop is where to go!   I don't know how red robin got its slogan Bc these sandwiches are \"Yummmmmmmmmmmm!!\"\""}
{"text":"Check out the website and the music!  Love it! The staff is very nice and helpful.  Went with a few others that had questions and the staff was very good at answering.   There are only a few high tables and the stools are a little low for the tables but we were not planning on staying long.  There is a side room that you can eat in that has a couch and table but we just used the high tables.    If you like Italian beef sandwiches, Go to OSI. Nicely season meat, nice and moist, topped with peppers. Nice and sloppy!   Just what the doctor ordered! As good as Chicago!  Good bread/bun.  A little smaller than 6 inches. There are 2 other sandwiches, and some electives/sides of salad, pasta and desserts. Only 4 small stainless steel tables.  If you are in the Waterfront area and looking for a good sandwich!  Here u go!  Address is on 9th Ave. but it is really in the alley behind the church/school.   In the basement of the old school."}
{"text":"Omg! You gotta try the sauce and meatballs! This is the real deal ! I'm Italian and always looking for good homemade Italian food, to bad I'm not from the area If not I'll have Nona cook everyday for me, a must place to go and fall in love with their food ! Definitely a 10!!  Grazie!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Homestead. Great sandwiches and salad with the homemade dressing. A+++++"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp.   Stopped in this evening and was not disappointed!   They let me sample a number of different menu items and I settled on one of the specials of the day, a meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"Now that's a meatball!  When trying meatballs, I always try to figure out what's a restaurants \"secret.\" It seems that the secret here is simplicity, which translates to perfection.   With a small menu, one could be weary there is nothing they will like, but it is impossible not to love the sauce, the meatball, and the salad dressing.  The location is odd for first timers--it's technically in between the bank and the church. If you're nearby, be sure to grab a meatball sub!"}
