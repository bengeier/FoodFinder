{"text":"service was awful food was even worst! my nacho's were so soggy i couldn't and wouldn't eat them! she asked were we done we said yes and she removed one plate?"}
{"text":"If the food and the service just being mediocre were the only things wrong with this place, I could probably get over that.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is practically nonexistent.  There's food stained all over the walls, the floors are dirty, and the silverware was not clean.  Aside from the cleanliness, the food was pretty bland and the salsa was watery.  If you're looking for good Mexican cuisine, I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everything was great food,service and atmosphere!! Best Margaritas in Gastonia,thank you for all Alfredo*****"}
{"text":"I've tried several of the Mexican places in town and Azteca is the best so far. The portions are huge and the food is consistently good. Casual atmosphere, but a little cramped for space."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years with my family and friends, and this place never disappoints me. They are always welcoming and friendly as soon as you come in the door. 
I recommend the cheese dip to go with the chips they bring you, and pico de gallo. The fiesta chimichanga and the chicken fajitas are wonderful dishes here, and they give you a yummy complementary dessert with every meal (just a fried chip with cinnamon sugar, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream). 
OH, and the margaritas. They are huge - like fishbowl huge. And SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and decent prices. They actually give way more food than I could hope to eat and it's not often I say that. Large portions plus friendly waitstaff = one happy Kristen! The bf and I will be headed back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best!!!! We have came here since I was younger, and now we come even more!! This weekend alone we have already been twice! We typically come once a week! This place has not only great prices, but they give you a LOT of food!! You will not leave hungry. The staff feel like family to us. Check out my pictures to see how much food you get! I recommend the fajitas, enchiladas, and cheese dip! If you like pico ask for it and they will bring it to the table."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Mexican  food to start but they have good food and the chilli reno is awesome when the wife want Mexican  that's the place for me"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I would definitely return if I was in Gastonia again which I really doubt will happen....."}
{"text":"We eat here most every week and enjoy the food tremendously.  The salsa is some of the best I've had in this area.  Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Eh. We are regulars at the Matthews location. Our service at this location was poor and the gaucomole which is sort of our staple was awful."}
{"text":"Service and staff were wonderful. It was my first time  in this place today and I will definitely go back. The folk was very good and the prices was very affordable."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and the most tasty and authentic Mexican food in this area. Ask for the GM Alfredo. You will never forget his friendly smile and attentive service. Love this place and will come here always!"}
{"text":"I very rarely get five stars but I have been to this place three times and each time was fantastic. I never waited more than 10 maybe 15 minutes tops for my meal, each time the servers were quick and very polite, each time my food Was delicious hot and fresh, and most importantly the pricing is more than fair. The food does not taste like it's out of a can, it taste fresh and feeling and it's always hot to the plate. I will continue to go here and give them my service. Even my five-year-old enjoys this place!"}
{"text":"First let me begin by saying that my waitress was spectacular. Fabulous Mexican rice. My beans for a little watery. They said it came from my chicken burrito. They substituted my chicken burrito cheerfully. I would come back because I want to try the chicken soup.

My lunch companion had the chicken fajitas and ate every last drop and said it was delicious.

She'll come back too"}
{"text":"We go here about 3x a month, food is always fresh and so good and the service and people are great!"}
{"text":"Food and potions were okay but we found a fly cooked into the complimentary dessert they serve. My friend and I were totally grossed out that our meals were cooked in the same kitchen where cooks don't recognize they've fried a whole insect in a dessert quesadilla. When we told the server and manager about it they were both very nonchalant. The manager finally obliged to taking $1 off of the bill. Seriously? Never again."}
