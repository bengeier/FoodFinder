{"text":"Great food great service. My wife and I had breakfast here over the weekend - coffee arrived at the table in record time and breakfast followed soon after.   The portions for \"the bunker\" (corn beef hash) are large enough that we each had a midmorning snack later in the day.  We've been in a number of times over the years and I've always been glad that we've stopped."}
{"text":"Have been here many times. Pros; Great priced food. Cute place with a small town feel. Great pies!! Kid friendly. Best fish in Burton.  Cons; Service is often slow. Not many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Very good and very inexpensive!  Split a dish (large portions)  Sirloin steak - very well seasoned Chicken noodle soup - excellent Potato skins - very large and very good Side salad - the weakest thing by a mile: iceberg lettuce The decor is stereotypical golf theme and a lot of old people. Portion sizes were huge and beer was cheap. ($3 Yeungling). I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"We love JC's. John & Cindy are always so welcoming. the rest of the staff, especially Holli, are always friendly & attentive. Everything on the menu is delicious, but their fried pickles are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch.  Located just off the square in Burton.  They have daily specials including pie (I think homemade?).  Definitely a local joint if you want a true \"Geauga county\" experience."}
{"text":"This place got 4 stars from me because of the pie.  Oh my the pie!!!  The chocolate cream is by far my favorite.  The coconut cream is a close second.  My husband and son love them too.  I can not wait to try them all.  They have decent burgers here.  They are very flavorful and I did not have to doctor it up like I do for other local places.  I was told they have awesome omlets do we will have to try breakfast here soon."}
{"text":"JCs is your quintessential small-town diner. The food is consistently good but nothing extraordinary. I Particularly like going there for breakfast. They do have a fantastic selection of pies as well. Over all it's a great place if you're looking for a good diner atmosphere and classic American food."}
{"text":"We got there after a busy period, but the place was very dirty. I didn't see the kitchen, but I took a couple of shots of the bathroom. I really don't want to go back there again."}
{"text":"We received a warm welcome from the hostess and wait staff. Our beverage order was immediately taken and filled.  We ordered one 10 oz steak dinner and one patty melt entree. Both beef items were served exactly as ordered-- well done steak and medium burger.  These were served with appealing sides, including sweet potato fries with Cajun mayo.  We finished with extraordinary hot chocolate cheese case and pleasant blueberry pie.  Service was friendly, prompt, and continuous.  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"What a great find! My husband found this one and I am so glad he brought us up to check it out for ourselves. Located just off the round about in Burton this little place is way more than meets the eye! I would have never imagined all the choices their menu had. From Salads to seafood to the two words I love to see Gulf Shrimp! They have a great menu and i truly feel confident saying something for everyone!  It was hard not to have the Gulf Shrimp but I was really wanting a sandwich and their special of the day was a steak dip! Oh my goodness was it delicious! I upped the side to their thick cut onion rings and was not disappointed. It's a big sandwich ladies - I had to use a knife and fork! Very juicy and good to the last bite!  Jason and Rhyan had burgers that were equally as delicious and looked amazing! She chose the Bacon Cheeseburger and Jason had a burger with their signature sauce and onion rings on it. My bunch is serious about their burgers and they rated these right up there with Michael Symons BSpot in Cleveland! That's some big words! I'm gonna have to try one on our next visit!  All in all it was a great meal and ran us around 10 or so per plate. Not bad. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is OK.  I've had extra items added to my bill on two different visits.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have only eaten here a couple of times but this is a great place to get some good homemade food that tastes fabulous!    The place is small, but the staff is attentive and the prices are very reasonable.  All around a great place to stop."}
{"text":"We stopped @ 2:00 pm on a Sunday on our way to the Geauga County Fair. The restaurant was busy but not packed so we were immediately seated. There are both booths & tables which may be combined for parties of 5 or more.  The hostess noted & quickly returned with our ordered beverages. There is a wide variety of menu options & daily specials, all reasonably priced. Unfortunately, breakfast is not served all day as I had hoped.  I had the french onion soup, Super Pattymelt & fries. My wife had a half rack of BBQ ribs, fries, & apple sauce. We both agreed the fries were very good & served in huge portions. The ribs were also very good, better than we've had at some exclusively BBQ restaurants. My patty melt was large & very good though more rare than medium as ordered. The french onion soup was OK having very little melted cheese on it.  The service was mediocre at best. I had to remind our server I had ordered water. My wife had to remind her she hadn't been served her side of applesauce. My soup bowl wasn't cleared from the table when our entr√©es were served. There was no follow-up on our meals until we were nearly finished. I never received a warm-up on my coffee. The service cost JC's one star.  There are not many dining options in Burton so I can understand why locals may be loyal. I may try a different local establishment before returning."}
{"text":"Not often you go into a little diner type place and they ask how you want your burger cooked.. most places always cook very well done, since it is frozen not fresh..THIS PLACE USES FRESH HAMBURGER.. hand made patties they were awesome.. order it med rare.. the fries are fresh cut very hot and crispy. First Night I visited they had gumbo soup that was amazing.. second visit had the burger again and a cup of green pepper soup that was good (not as good as gumbo)"}
{"text":"Best burger around ! Great service and the breakfast is huge!! My family's favorite place for food around this area"}
{"text":"Few food was very good and fresh! Had a veggie burger and fries. Staff was friendly but good came out a bit slow. Cute little joint  out in the country."}
{"text":"Manager (owner?) came out and argued with me after her server kindly brought my order back for being overcooked.  I had ordered a slice of their prime rib (that night's special) medium-rare but the meat came out completely gray at all points and all the way through.  When she confronted us at the table I spoke kindly the entire time, not to make a scene, and just stuck to the facts pointing out the order was cooked well-done.  She insisted on telling us it simply can't be, that it was warmed up in hot au jus sauce for only a moment, and came off as if we didn't know the difference between medium-rare versus well-done.  I really wanted to tell her, \"hello lady, take a look at the meat on the plate and tell me if you see any red or pink at all!\" but I bit my tongue and let finish her rant before returning to the kitchen.  Our server (a nice guy we've always had wait on us) witnessed this and took care of us afterward and we rewarded him with a handsome tip accordingly.   But for the manager's attitude and comments we will not return and that means a downgrade from my last review to 1-star from us.  Besides, I've never heard of preparing prime rib by boiling it in au jus sauce as she stated they do."}
{"text":"OK, so I have never figured out why they doesn't start the lunch menu until 12:30 on the weekends. Maybe it's just me, but after about 11:00, I would like a lunch option.   Other than the unusual hours they keep, JC's is a gem. The food is always better and more diverse than it needs to be. From the homemade salad dressings to the nightly specials, JC's always delivers. It's the kind of place you can take your mom, your wife, or the kids and everyone comes away happy."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast and happy we did.  Food was plentiful, hot and tasty.   Good portion sizes for the price.   Convenient to the town square and pleasant staff. We'd definitely return if we are out this way again."}
{"text":"We visit this spot at least once a year and have been for the last four years.  The restaurant is usually super busy but the turn over rate is amazing and we somehow always get in without waiting very long. The decor is golf based and everyone gets mismatched coffee mugs which I think is a cute little touch.    Since we've started going,  I've had the Eggs Benedict,  foot long breakfast wrap,  corned beef hash and pancakes!  All of which have been wonderful! The food is always hot and comes out quick.  Drinks are always full and refilled promptly.  We will definitely be going back again next year,  and even if we were driving through, I may even stop just because we are familiar with the spot and know the quality."}
{"text":"Place was dirty, service slow and sparse,  food was mediocre.  Just not a great like place like I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"My family meets up near here every year for a camping trip, and we always stop here for breakfast the last day before we head back to our homes. Every time it has been great. We are always seated quickly, which is surprising because we typically have 7-8 people, and the place is always packed.  Since we only go once a year I've only had a few things so far, all of which has been delicious. I will recommend the corned beef hash which was homemade, salty and really damn good.  The biscuits and gravy was also very good.  My most recent meal here was the breakfast burrito.  This has eggs, cheese, sausage, grilled peppers and onions, and was killer after a night of drinking at our camp site. The food is awesome, and the service is great, and even better, the prices are on the low side which is nice for a big group. Definitely a great place to grab a solid breakfast, check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped for late breakfast.  We both had eggs Benedict.  It was very good.  I will return."}
{"text":"There aren't many dining choices in Burton but JC's is the clear leader.  The food is a bit better than what is expected from a small rural diner and the prices are reasonable.  The kids love the treasure chest."}
{"text":"This a great stop not far from Punderson State Park. We were a group of 8 and were seated easily and served quickly! They are busy for breakfast too so they obviously have a good system going. The servers are friendly and attentive and I never went without coffee and water.   The sausage bagel was delicious. There was a ton of cheese and 2 eggs. The sausage had great flavor and the bagel seemed fresh. It's also a great price for such a large meal. The hash browns could be better.. they weren't browned much.  I also tried the pancakes and YUM! Have to get these next time. They are huge and fluffy and have great flavor. You don't even need syrup!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Surprised by how busy it is on a Wednesday morning. Kids all loved their food. Portion size is good. Looks like we found our new goto breakfast place since moving to Auburn . No kids menu, so just order ala cart."}
{"text":"Hubby had s big breakfast with eggs, hash browns and sausage. He cleaned his plate. I had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup. I enjoyed the generously-sizedpancakes which were well made and the syrup. The blueberries were definitely in the freezer too long and were dry and tough. The endless coffee was great. If the blueberries were fresh (or probably even canned) they would have gotten a better review."}
{"text":"Okay, not to be mean, but this place reminds me of something you would see on restaurant impossible that needs help.  We stayed at the Red Maple Inn and they highly recommend this place. They raved about the food. I like to eat healthy and noticed the flounder looks good . It's the only thing decent/healthy on the menu. I get that and when I got it, it had no taste, the veggies taste like from a can and the bake potato was microwaved. I'm not a nit picky person, but the way I describe it is true. The staff was so kind and helpful.  The restaurant was decent. It could use better decor and update. I'm not one to complain, but this place could use alittle help with better quality of food."}
{"text":"Solid small town diner with goodAmericana food me up. Solid breakfast and lunch. Big fan of the fries."}
{"text":"Lunch under $10 with water to drink. That's what I look for when out with my girl friends. JC's is a nice casual eatery. Good service. Good food piled high! Most sandwiches come with cole slaw or fries. Onion rings or sweet potato fries are extra. Daily specials. We had the burger, flatbread sandwiches and tuna melt. All hardy and yummy good. Found on Yelp."}
{"text":"Used to come here often for take outs. Loved it. Dined in today. Curt service from the female hostess and server.  Everyone at our table sighed. Oh well. But the food was great."}
