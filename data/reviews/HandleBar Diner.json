{"text":"Stopped by Eastmark and decided to give the diner a shot; shakes were AMAZING!! Also had the pretzels and very good quality. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite burger joint!! The 1St time I went to this place it was really busy, they had only been open for 2 days. My experience wasn't the greatest however I knew this place had grater potential. So I didn't give up and decided to give them another try!!   I was lucky to speak with Adam one of the owner about my experience. He was glad that I spoke to him about the problem and offered to fix the issue!! Also I spoke with couple of the employees while I was there, they love working for Adam (owners) because of the passion they demonstrate for food drives them all !!!  I've always had a soft spot for burgers so I know when I find an excellent burger joint that's worth going back to!"}
{"text":"Been here twice since it opened, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and the food is amazing! The only negative experience was the amount of flies that are around you while you eat and the weather. I know both of these can't be controlled by the restaurant but I wish they would have made more of an inside dining area as opposed to outside seating... Especially in the AZ summer!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were really good, the fly problem is beyond belief.   We had to put some of our food on another table just to get some of the flys away from us, just look at the pic...    The drinks were great but 1/2 normal size at twice the price.  Anyway I'll raise the rating if I come back and the fixed the fly problem.  Just changed my review to a two star instead of a three star because there staff wrote me saying I'm ridiculous, instead of just saying sorry, were actually trying to do something about this.  If you look at their overall rating it's obvious other people don't care for this place either...."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has a really fun atmosphere and huge patio. Came for the drinks but was really more impressed with the food! The soft pretzels were awesome and the crispy chicken was even better. Will be back here again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Stunned they have that many stars. Went up to the window to place a to go order. The young lady told us it would be 5-10 minutes before they could even take our order? I have been there several times and it seems like every time there is different people like they have high turnover. Service has declined since I started going there right after they opened."}
{"text":"Best ceviche this side of Baja California!  My husband had the chicken sandwich with grilled onions.... to die for!  Eddie and \"Chef\" were so friendly.  The diner is right out of the 50's but the menu has some great twists along with fabulous traditional fare. Super friendly staff and they have mixed drinks as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"They had there growing pains when they first opened, to be expected. Everytime I go back I continue to be impressed. Not only is it great for the Eastmark Community to have, but its worth going to even if you don't live in Eastmark. Breakfast/Brunch, Lunch/Dinner and  even Take-Out. Its a definite stopping place when people come to visit. Love the atmosphere and even better when my bestie visits from Tacoma and brings my godson, her expectations were met and then some. Wishes she had a place like this in her neighborhood. Adults can enjoy a tasty beverage, and still let the kids explore."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday breakfast after my wife and daughter went on Saturday. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as they said it was the day before. Some of our food was cold some was warm. Was disappointed when when I ordered sausage and eggs with \"breakfast potatoes\" only to find out they were more like potato chips.  Sausage was great but the potatoes killed it for me. My wife's biscuits and gravy came out cold and had to wait another 10 minutes to get new order.  My son had the french toast that was supposed to have berries but they didn't have berries. Our waiter did a great job and was on the spot with refills and doing his best with what he had to work with from the kitchen. Overall I would say it has potential but was not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is a legit restaurant . The chef knows what he's doing and executes it perfectly . This place will do very well staff is friendly and knows the menu and the spot is really nice. Good job guys"}
{"text":"This little diamond in the neighborhood is the best. The Nachos... soooo good! We've also had the burgers, burrito, and did I mention he nachos?  Great place to enjoy a beer and some food with friends. The kids can play in the grassy area while you enjoy watching sports out in the wonderful AZ sunshine. The service is always friendly and prompt too. We have eaten there and picked food to take home. It's great to have a yummy place to grab food in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice place but they messed up my Lobster Sliders(3).  I paid $18 for one slider! I got screwed over.  Tried to call the diner and no one answers."}
{"text":"I think this place is ok.  I would chalk up the high score to the location. There isn't much over in that area and this is in a park.  It seems to be situated to allow dads a cold beer to take the edge off while watching over their annoying brood.    The food is pretty good bar fare, but the service is slow.  The manager is constantly overwhelmed and is prone to freak-outs.  Not much on tap either and they are always out of something.    The loaded tots are solid.  The hot dogs are not great.  It's more about the toppings, but the dog is a flimsy bargain dog.  So unless you're hanging out at the park, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful ! We love the new diner. Big menu with something for everyone. Food is good- especially the fries. Cute location in Eastmark with lots of outdoor seating and good views. Small bar area inside with a few seats. Staff was very sweet  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant to have in East Mesa/Gilbert. I like that each dish has a special twist which makes it unique. The portions are pretty big and they have very decent prices on food.  Their nachos with short ribs are hands down the best nachos I've ever had. They had the best queso on them and the short ribs were so tasty. The wings have been featured as some of the best in Phoenix and they live up to it! I've been here 3 times (4 tomorrow) and really look forward to visiting each time.  The staff is also quite friendly and the service is pretty fast. We consider ourselves pretty lucky to have a place like this in our community."}
{"text":"We are very excited about having a restaurant walking distance from our house. We were able to choose our own seats. It took a long time for a server to greet us. The hostess ended up taking our drink order and assured us that a server would be with us. When he finally showed up, he was very impersonal and did not introduce himself. He took our order and left.   The food took a very long time. But it was so good! This is what will be bringing us back. We had the west style loaded tots, my husband got a buffalo style chicken sandwich (cleverly called \"Boy I Love Losing Superbowls\" on the menu), and I had the \"GCS\", a grilled chicken sandwich. I opted for onion rings as my side and there was no extra charge. French fries were good as well.   Ultimately, I think the service staff is poorly trained. The Handlebar Diner would be better off as a counter-service restaurant. Nonetheless, we will be going back to try the other menu items because the food was good. We can overlook the poor service for the excellent food. I hope that the servers can get some better training!"}
{"text":"Excellent service today with fresh food. I had a chicken sandwich and hubby had a burger for lunch. Simple order, but both sandwiches were juicy and the toppings tasted fresh. You can taste the \"farm to plate\" philosophy at this diner.  We also split the pretzels as an appetizers; they were soft and flavorful. The service was outstanding! Haven't experienced such great service at a restaurant in a long time. We will return."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Well done chef Adam.  Amazing service that is very friendly.  We will definitely be making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious.  I wish I wasn't so bloated I can't think of anything entertaining/well-written to say, so please accept my recommendation and stuff your face here."}
{"text":"Poor service, we waited forever to get some help. Burgers were not to great and server got my order wrong. Over priced for quality of food."}
{"text":"The food is really good, we love the chicken wings. The only thing the last few visits the food were cold and they take for ever and the place wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Super cute spot! Didn't plan on eating lunch but the patio set up with the misters and picnic style benches lured me in! Ordered the Arizona salad and it was delish! Steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well! I'm quite picky when it comes to steak and this didn't taste like cheap fatty meat ( a major plus).  After we ate we sat on the grass and finished the beers we ordered on the Adirondack chairs ( perfect afternoon pick me up)! If youre near by stop on!! Only down fall is it is a bit pricey, $36 for two beers and the salad with tip.  They had a good lunch/brunch menu too we just missed that by an hour."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this Restaurant I think I find out about the Chef through The Simple Farm's Instagram post about a farm to table event . My friend and I drove from Ahwatukee. Upon entering the restaurant we were abruptly greeted with \" What can I help you with ? \" my response Um I think we came here to eat . Answer . Here's a menu sit inside or out . We sat at the counter & it was filthy as was the plastic menu ( how hard is it to wipe down plastic menus) I looked at my friend and said let's go . I was in the bar restaurant business for 30 years. Customer Service & Cleanliness paramount in the business. I sent the Owner Chef a message about our experience. I guess he couldn't be bothered as he never replied . Don't waste your time ."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have drove by this diner a couple of times and decided to try it out one night. We walked to the diner and were confused if we could just sit down or had to walk inside the diner and order. An employee told us to pick a table and that we would be helped shortly. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting to be helped, while two other servers were helping out other customers next to us. Yes, next us. They walked past us more than 4 times without saying a word. We walked out and they didn't even acknowledge that we walked out or apologized. Really wanted to try it out! So bummed."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and was so excited to try it.  I really wanted to be able to say I was blown away, but I wasn't.  The place had several customers but wasn't packed.  There were plenty of places to sit outside and there were no customers inside.   We were seated and immediately got menus.  Our drink order was taken fairly soon after and drinks delivered.  Hubby's beer wasn't very cold and we learned they were running out of ice.  They were out of milkshakes - again - and we overheard the staff tell another customer they were also out of something else.  We waited...and waited...and waited for our food, finally coming out after 45 minutes.  While we waited on our food other people arrived and, after being told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes, they left.  We wouldn't have minded the wait if the food had been worth it.  It was barely lukewarm when it came out, except for the onion rings which were hot and we guessed the plates had been ready but were waiting on the rings.  I ate half my food and left the rest.  Hubby said his Cruiser was good but not consistent in temperature...one bite almost hot and the next not at all.  The flavors of our sandwiches were good but would certainly have been much better if they'd been hot.  There are definitely bugs to be worked out here and I hope they're able to get it together.  We'll give them some time to hit their groove then will try it again.    The plus side today was the wait staff who worked diligently to try and keep the customers happy.  They were attentive but not hovering and really made sure we were never low on drinks while waiting for our meals.  One of the staff even asked the kitchen for a side of fries for some customers who were upset that they'd been waiting so long.  New openings always experience some bumps but hopefully Handlebar will be able to overcome their problems and be that neighborhood \"go to\" spot when we get the munchies."}
{"text":"I just tried this place out for the first time. This particular restaurant is in eastmark housing development which is cool if you live in the neighborhood. I happened to go when the hot wings where on special for fifty cents a piece. So I ordered some Carolina and parmeasan garlic. I also tried the pretzel bread. The wings are good and the pretzel bread was delicious. I'd definitely come back and try their breakfast or maybe stop in on a Saturday night for a drink."}
{"text":"Hard to find, but worth finding! Small place, but has nice outdoor seating. Great onion rings! And the burgers are big and messy (in a good way)   There's no sign from the street, but there's no place like it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to us.  I will never come back! I was so excited to show my family the restaurant so we rode our bikes up and took a seat. Right away the waitress let's us know that she will take our drink order but it will be awhile before returning. Her attitude was embarrassing! 20 minutes later we get notice that the beer we ordered is out of stock. So water it is! In addition, she let's me know that they're out of high chairs. We ordered nachos and a few other items. 10 mins later we get a heads up that they're out of chips for the nachos, but we get a quality eye roll this time...We ended up just heading out. It's always such a bad experience when we come. Cold food, taco Tuesday(gross, gross, gross) my brother who eats everything and anything couldn't even choke the tacos down.  I'm always making excuses for them such as, it's the heat or it's a new place so my husband will go back. I love that you can ride your bike up but We can't do that kind of service or quality anymore."}
{"text":"For those of you that enjoy small Diner's this one located by my home is just perfect. Great menu and pricing to boot. Service and the visit from a manager that cares about their work product was not expected. Way to go Handlebar Diner."}
{"text":"The cheese steak sandwich was life changing!!Loved it!!!! The out door atmosphere and location makes this a gem in East Mesa! Try there milk shakes too!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times.  Twice on?Saturday morning 8am.  Total time in and out 1and a half hour.  My meal was great.  My friends meals were cold but tasty. Had breakfast this morning 5/18 9am.  Food came up right away, very good and service with a smile.  Love that it's local. And after a rough start, looks like they're working out the kinks.  Definitely a place to enjoy a meal.  Looking forward to the day I can give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The veggie board and chicken wings were awesome. Great start to the meal , tasty, and visually appealing. The service was great. Attentive staff, we were quickly greeted and sat. They also had a great beer selection. Will return."}
{"text":"We tried HandleBar Diner for the first time tonight.  DELICIOUS food!  We tried the crispy chicken sandwiches - hand battered chicken breast...very good!  home made onion rings...melt in your mouth!  The Handlebar burger  was very good - lots of meat....house made sauce added some zing.  Loaded tater tots - western style - TRULY loaded with meat, avocado, cheeses, beans, corn!  Small restaurant but we did take out.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, concept good, but if you sit inside (and who wouldn't in this heat!) you hear the banging of the doors every time either a customer or server goes outside!! Omg!!! I wanted to scream!!!  Because of the coming and goings, there will be flies in the establishment.  So I appreciate the local eatery, but the flies and banging of the doors kill it for a repeat visit from me! Just want to mention, customer service very good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch yesterday and everything we got was AMAZING!! And the service was great! You need to try the avocado toast if you haven't, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Super cute local diner. We went here for the first time just to check it out since we live in the area. The environment is pretty chill and the food was great. Our server Eddy was pretty awesome too. He joked with us and made us feel at home. Definitely would come back here. Nice that it's only 2 miles from our house."}
{"text":"We live in Eastmark and are so lucky to have this fantastic little diner right in the hood The menu has lots of variety and choices. I got the Grilled Chicken with Onion Rings and my significant other got the OC burger and she loved it. The outside seating is perfect to enjoy this time of year."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. I ordered wings to get started and a burger after and it was all delicious. They also offer a pretty large selection of local beers which was great. I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome local beers on tap. We will definitely make this one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"As residents of the community that this restaurant is located in, I can tell you we are so lucky and excited to have these guys here! My husband and I went with some good friends the first weekend it was open, and surprisingly had very few hiccups! Our food was outstanding. They brought our 3 year old daughters food out super fast, and ours was pretty fast behind hers. I had the Crispy Chicken sandwich that was awesome, and husband had the French Dip I believe and said he loved it. Our ONLY complaint was that the canned beers we got were extremely....not cold. But that's something that can be fixed. Also, it would be awesome to get some music, fans, misters....they'll need all that stuff to keep the customers coming in the summer time. :) But you better believe this will be a frequent staple to my husband, daughters and our neighborhood \"framily\" to come eat, drink and hang out! We wish them the best of luck and can't wait to work our way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Kid friendly yet they are too cheap to print a kids menu.  Stupid.  This place is going down hill.  Service is spool slow."}
{"text":"Cute little diner in Eastmark. Inside is extremely tight but the outdoor space is nice and spacious. Their are a lot of families here with the splash pad being next door but we didn't mind. We came on a Friday night and it was pretty dead. This seems more like a place you would come to for lunch. We ordered a couple beers which came in a can (kinda cool) haven't seen that in a while. For dinner we ordered the west loaded tator tots (yum) and split the windjammer. Food was delicious and service was nice. We will definitely be back once it cools down a little :)."}
{"text":"Food has room for improvement, but the location, environment, and prices are all promising! I like being able to just drop by casually with friends, hang out under the misters, and enjoy the outdoors. I think the menu items are great, but the flavors need some tweaking!"}
{"text":"This place is awesomely unique. We were told about it by some Canadians passing through town only to find out it was less than 5 miles from my own house. How did I miss this great spot. They rotate craft beer in and out and always have something new to try. I recommended a beer to the owner and he even put it on tap the next month. The food is fresh and made to order. Really great homaede Pizza sauce.  I have been back with friends and family and will continue to go as long as I can."}
{"text":"We love handlebar. We go there all the time! Their food is great, we love the wings, nachos and their shakes!!! They also have great specials all the time that I highly suggest you try. It is so nice to hang out, have a cold drink under the misters and relax. I recently went to their Thursday night trivia and had a blast. ( I'm terrible at trivia but my friends were all good haha)"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Handlebar Diner.   Great service from the staff.   I had the nacho's again since they were so good the last time,and they were just as awesome on this occasion.  My wife had the chicken tender basket. She said she really like the nice crisp texture of the outside which was very light. She said the tenders were very meaty, and the comeback sauce paired well with them.   Thank you for the great food and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because I wanted the lobster rolls. I also heard great things from a friend who lives in Eastmark and frequents the diner. Let's just say I was disappointed. I was there Friday afternoon for lunch and the service sucked! I went inside got a menu. The waitress said someone would be outside shortly to take my order. That never happened until another waitress noticed me sitting there. Disgusted with the waitress who should have been helping, this waitress said she'd be with me. Finally service or so I thought. I ordered the lobster rolls. She wasn't sure but thought they were out. She took my menu, went to check, came back without a menu and said they were out. With no menu, she asked if I wanted to order something else. Other things- the waitress would forget to bring things I asked for, the waitress who should have been helping me was too busy posing to make sure her fake boobs stood out. I can go on but I'm tired. I won't  be going back. Red Lobster just came out with small plates and they have lobster rolls! I gave it 2 stars because the short rib nachos were delicious BUT that doesn't make up for poor service."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have EVER had dining out. We were a party of 5 with reservations at 7 pm for the crab feast, to celebrate my husband's birthday. After 2 HOURS, we finally left without ever being served dinner, and in all that time - after 50 minutes of waiting - we only had one round of warm beer. We were mad, hot, hungry, and bitten up by gnats. Waitresses kept lying to us and telling us our food was next to be served, yet everyone else around us who arrived later than we did had their crab served to them, eaten and left. Clearly a management problem - you don't have an event like this without staggered reservation times when all you have is 2 burners to cook on (one of the excuses the waitress gave us). The manager on site didn't even have the decency to offer us the round of beer on the house. If you like sitting on dirty picnic tables, getting eaten up by bugs, drinking warm beer and never getting served your meal - this place is for you. Otherwise, skip this disaster altogether."}
{"text":"This place seemed like a good idea. Sadly during the busy hour of lunch it was too much for the cooks. Every table around us was constantly told sorry for the wait and etc.   After being there for an hour our food finally came out dish by dish and not all of it came at once. When the food did come it was all either Luke warm or cold, every meal had to be returned and be redone. Poor service along with poor food. Doubtful we will return here."}
{"text":"An incredibly charming little diner in the Eastmark community. Their loaded tots are amazing, but be warned if you order them, you won't be hungry for much else because it's a huuuuuuuuge serving. Zero regrets ordering them though (and to be fair, we were warned that it was a lot of food. We just opted to be gluttons that day). Hubby had Lobster Roll Sliders which he seemed to love. I didn't try them since I'm not a huge fan of lobster. I also got the mac & cheese which I think was actually missing the chimichurri sauce, but it was delicious even without it. BUT THE TOTS YOU GUYS. I left bloated, but extremely happy."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, kids can play in the nearby field and splashpad close to diner. That is the best part. TV's have several lines running through video playing. Looks as if they were damaged. The service is below par. Long waiting to even be greeted. Food tatses decent but good luck getting your food warm. Prices are about $2.00 more than what it should be for each item. Has a ton of potential, but lacking were it means the most....customer service."}
{"text":"Went to look at the homes around here and we were hungry. I loved this place! The food was so fresh and so good. The flavors went so well together. I recommend this to anyone. Great local restaurant. Unique items. Must try."}
{"text":"This place gets busy here from time to time so when it isn't busy it the best service.  Wait staff are friendly and so are their best when it is packed.  The Pork Nachos are very good and best time to hit the place up for drinks is when it's happy hour otherwise it's a bit expensive.  Great outdoor place to to eat out.   Very few seats inside at a counter.  Mostly outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Unique place with friendly staff. It's awesome that we have personally seen the owner Chef Adam in action! The food never disappoints and the shakes are amazing. Not too many places have the same story of the building actually being transplanted from another state and that just adds to the attraction."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! We were playing at the splash pad when our kids got hungry. I sent my husband over to pick up a kids turkey sandwich not knowing they were doing a special Mother's Day brunch until 2 pm. They were so awesome and made a turkey sandwich special for us! Really appreciate that kind of service and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this neighborhood diner and what a disappointment!  They ran out of items we wanted and the food is way overpriced for what you get. $8 for a milkshake...are you kidding me?  Ordered nachos and they were absolutely gross!  Threw open a bag of tortilla chips and dumped on cookie sheet topped with maybe 5 black beans and some sauce that tasted like chipotle mayonnaise not cheese. So disappointed we won't go back.  Can't imagine it could ever make it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I love that this place is conveniently placed in the middle of many neighborhoods. It brings out people, even those not in Eastmark. The prices and happy hour are fair. Only downfall is that it can get hot because it's an outdoor diner (besides the small seating inside), maybe some misters and fans outside in the future? This place is still new, so I expect some improvements in the future. Also, due to its size, I wish they wouldn't host events that they wouldn't be able to accommodate. I understand they can service us, but when it's busy, it's slow for customers, especially waiting in the heat. I would recommend this place for homebodies who don't want to leave/ travel far for good eats."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited when we found out our community had a local restaurant/bar within walking distance to our house, and it does not disappoint.   We have gone once, for trivia.   The service, food and atmosphere were amazing.  We definitely will be frequenting The Handle Bar Diner for not only trivia and beer, but also their amazing food.   You will not be disappointed when you try it out."}
{"text":"The Handlebar is awesome.  John A's review on 6/1 was a hatchet job, since for once in his short life an adult told him what to do. The food is great, the beer is cold and the staff is friendly. Please keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Yummy and right in my awesome neighborhood!  Dog-friendly patio, fast service, friendly people, delish food!  All in the beautiful Eastmark setting. Happy to see it off to a roaring start. Looking forward to many more meals and drinks here!  Had a yummy burger (the backyard), awesome fries. Everything was perfect. Quick service.   Round 2:  bagels and coffee today. Toaster oven not working so cook tried to heat bagels on stove. No bueno. And the bagels are not very good. Just like bread. Cream cheese was weird. Waitress was busy flirting with the guys in the back. The slamming doors were beyond annoying (we ate inside cuz it's June). I think when the owners are there it's pretty good. Otherwise you are at the mercy of non-stakeholders. Hit or miss.   Round 3:  daughter and her friends (15 year olds) have been going for trivia night on Thursdays. Apparently the wait staff are frustrated by the lack of tips from this group as the last time they went the server decided to teach them all about tipping. How '15-20% is the norm' and how 'you don't want to appear cheap when you are on a date so you should leave a good tip!'  My kid - and the others - know how to tip - but when she had to go inside to order a milkshake - since the server never came by their table - she didn't feel the server deserved a tip. A tip is not a given. It's earned. Sometimes the servers just keep change - assuming it's their tip. There have also been times when they have called people who had picked up to-go orders to ask for a tip!  This isn't a fine dining establishment. It's a diner. The food is hit or miss. Almost all seating is outside and the flies are annoying.  I'm going to drive a bit further and eat at Joe's Farm Grill or another fave - Flancer's.  Prices are better and so is the food and the service."}
{"text":"This place is such a good concept in such a great neighborhood. Food is great! For breakfast you can tell their bagels and many other things are freshly baked that morning. Delicious. Must try place!"}
{"text":"Woah...I have to write a review here again about this diner! Tuesdays are Street Taco days! I have been wanting to check this diner out again and try something new and man...was I blown away! Their Street Taco's out of this WORLD!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge portions, and great local beer! Although the prices are a little high, the quality, quality, and convenience it suburb! They've come a long way with adding the outdoor tvs and the social aspect is fun for the whole family! I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Sorry Handlebar but your margaritas were not tasty and food choices subpar. There was also much confusion with your wait staff. Love the location but not fond of your place. We'll try again in a few months.   Update: owner did reach out with gift certificate offer. I opted not to accept gift certificate but said I'll try it again since I live in area."}
{"text":"We've been here frequently and love it! Love the location, the staff and the food. The nachos are delicious and I have a hard time choosing something different because they're so good. My husband loves the burgers. We enjoy coming here and are so glad we have a restaurant/bar within walking distance"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and would highly recommend!! We go there almost every Saturday or Sunday morning for breakfast or lunch depending on the weather."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  This place is awesome.  My sister and her family live in Eastmark and they recommended we stop here for lunch.  Farm to table amazingness.  Great food, chopped cobb with blackened salmon was To. Die. For.  Kids loved their burgers, said they're better than dad's, but not to tell him.  Good beer, had a Dragoon IPA.  Baseball game was on the outdoor seating, life was good!  Will make the drive back, for sure."}
{"text":"Solid food and love new TVs outside. Great service and unique menu. Enjoy sandwiches in particular."}
{"text":"If your priority is fast food, Handlebar Diner will probably come up short.  However, if you're seeking an awesomely delicious chili relleno special, terrifically tasty hamburger, outstanding onion rings, phenomenal Philly cheesesteak (with actual CheezWhiz), or other similar fare, this a must on your dining bucket list.  The patio overlooks Eastmark's Great Park so this is a relaxing, fun gathering place.  The servers are outstanding and attentive to their patrons.  The small kitchen (it's a vintage diner, after all) accounts for the wait from order to having a plate set in front of you.   But you can enjoy a drink or two and soak up the ambience.  Then fill up on some of the best food in the area.  We been to Handlebar twice and now that we're East Valleyites, will likely be regulars."}
{"text":"Too much good stuff to say about this Diner, get over here and enjoy the food and drinks. Great folks working here, the wife and I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Dropped into this tiny gem based on Yelp reviews and were pleasantly surprised with the quaint & cozy atmosphere. Wings were on special and we tried 6 different flavors and ended up taking a couple dozen home to put in the freezer for emergencies. No tap beer the night we were there but they do have 3 handles that should come back on line soon. Tried several local craft beers in bottles and cans and were not disappointed. Looking forward to eating outside in the future when weather permits. Friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"It has been an epicurian adventure discovering new menu items that are different, delicious, affordable and with personal service to match!  This little bistro is nestled in the new and growing Eastmark Neighborhood in East Mesa right next to the pool, parks and community center! If you are looking for casual, private, unique and a mostly outdoor experience, check it out!  Try the Short Rib 4 Cheese Grilled Cheese with Tomato Jam w/Tots!  It is amazing!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good food! Some unique menu choices, and very friendly service. We enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant nice outside sitting area with TVs. Food not so good. Also after eating I became very parched and the fish n chips had no flavor to it at all. Maybe next time I would just come back and get beers and watch a game on the tvs outside."}
{"text":"Overall meh.  Onion rings were good.  Fries were good  Burger...not so much.  Heavy charred taste (to the point that's all you tasted).  Bun was stale.  Comeback sauce was rather flavorless...or just overpowered by the aforementioned charred taste.  Interior seating is small and cramped, but plenty of outside seating if the weather is good (raining during visit).  Took almost 15 minutes to get meal and we were the only ones in the place.  That being said when others ordered food seem to come out faster...may the cook just needed to get warmed up.  Restroom (singular) was across from the restaurant in another building."}
