{"text":"I remember when this place was a hardware store. These guys were some of the first on the \"new\" block and they have staying power for good reasons!  Irish hospitality, good beer, friendly bartenders and amazing fried fish - what more could you ask for? Oh yeah, futball on the big screens and a constant street scene through the big front windows.   And we never fail to see an old friend!"}
{"text":"Weird experience. I walked into the Old Angle, expecting to order a beer. The bartender, a young woman whose name I didn't catch, but I believe began with a \"V\", absolutely ignored me. I sat at the bar and watched her serve others who came in after me. When I tried to get her attention, she waved me off and said she was \"busy serving other customers.\" Fair to say that I was stunned. I left. The next day, I contacted the owner. In all fairness to him, he was very considerate and mentioned that the other bartender who was working with her had corroborated my story. Although the owner seems like a good guy, (gave me a gift certificate)  this is a review for the establishment. Because my experience was so ridiculously bad, gotta give the Old Angle one star."}
{"text":"The concept of an Irish bar with mostly faux old-Irish decor (\"stonework\", big wooden castle-y doors, as well as a nifty and I believe genuine old tin ceiling) that caters especially to soccer fans in Ohio City could easily have gone horribly wrong on so many levels.  Fortunately, it didn't.  The Old Angle is a real nice place to spend an afternoon.     Initially, we noted that the beer selection seemed a tad limited, but we figured with Guinness, Harp and Arrogant Bastard (Double Bastard too) you can't go too far wrong.  My companion, the Guinness aficionado, was thrilled with how fresh the Guinness on tap was, as well as with the fact that it only cost five dollars a pint.  We also noted a nice selection of whiskeys.  Food was better than average pub grub.  I recommend the lamb stew as being very fresh and aromatic, similar to bar food I've had in UK rather than the Dinty Moore type \"stew\" you usually get in the USA.  Our stew and burger also came with very good bread.    Wait staff was super friendly and FAST with the drinks and food.   A plethora of TVs were split between football game and soccer match, while an odd mix of obscure 70s album cuts (Rundgren, Ian Hunter. Steely Dan )  played rather softly in the background, allowing for conversation.  I'd expected to find much more of a soccer-club atmosphere, but it was just pleasantly social for a weekend afternoon, and much less hectic/touristy than the Great Lakes brewpub restaurant can get around the same times.      The place is currently located on a slightly skeevy block at the edge of the gentrified area.  Besides the Old Angle, the block contained several restaurants that currently aren't operating, and some slightly shady looking neighborhood businesses (check cashing, insurance, grocery). Fortunately, ample street and lot parking are available within a few steps of the Old Angle's entrances. It's also convenient to bus routes, especially if you're coming from points west."}
{"text":"Every time I come here everything is great! I haven't tried a lot of the food here but I've tried the wings and they were great. Bartenders are always super helpful. I was there pretty late once and ordered a hot toddy and the bartender went out of his way to make it perfectly for me."}
{"text":"The main issue I had with this bar (strong drinks, decent bartender-do not get the cranberry vodka..taste like juice) was with the security guard. Which they didn't need, because nobody was there. During pride, when every other bar was packed. This woman was VERY rude, took our drinks from us at 2:00am and told us to leave ASAP. She did not tell a single other person to leave. This bar is for townies who are trying to avoid the good, popular bars which don't suck."}
{"text":"This is very much a neighborhood bar. As a first timer, the staff was very nice, a great selection of beers and great bar food."}
{"text":"Great service! Good food!! The staff really goes out of their way to take care of you here. It's a favorite spot in cleveland : )"}
{"text":"I've been compiling a list of places to try around W25th and this was definitely on it. We stopped by here tonight and as soon as I walked in, I loved the vibe and decor. We sat at the bar and were promptly served. Their beer selection is pretty good - I like that they have more of the off-beat beers and not just the customary domestics (which they have too!). I was super exited to try their food but the bartender told us they are redoing their kitchen so we ordered sandwiches from Bogtrotter's next store. There is a window inside Old Angle where you can just order the sandwich you choose and they will bring it right to you.  Bogtrotter's sammies are pretty darn good. I had the Chicago with roast beef, peppers and it come served with au jus - which you can get on the side, \"wet\" or \"drenched\". I chose the \"wet\" option and would've preferred a little more so i'll make a mental note to get the \"drenched\" version next time. B got the Porkopolis sammy that looked equally as good as mine and his had chips inside too.  I always have a slight test when I go to restaurants - judging them on their bathrooms and Old Angle didn't disappoint. Clean and funky-designed bathrooms.  The service was alright, we were served pretty fast throughout the evening although we did see some people who seemed to be having trouble ordering and were waiting at the bar for awhile.  We definitely enjoyed this place and will be back to try the pub grub once the kitchen opens back up!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars for our second experience here. About a year ago I ate at the old angle and thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  I was eager to take my out of town guests for some good food and brews.  My guests and I have much experience in food service and usually are very understanding.  We never got asked if we wanted water. Actually I didn't see the server come near us until he brought our food over 45 minutes after we ordered and 10 minutes after the food was basking under the heat lamps.  45 minutes might not seem long but the bar was pretty desolate when we entered.  The only way I got a lime with my cocktail was to go up to the bar and get it myself.  My boyfriend sat with an empty whiskey glass, eager for another.  I asked our server for the coleslaw on the side and received a soggy fish and chips platter...hardly the beer battered delicacy I Experienced last time. My friend had the chicken toes which were so hard and overcooked it was disturbing to think they would try to serve it.  My boyfriend had cold wings and we were disgusted at the attitude of our server whom didn't seem to understand customer service or quality control. When I asked to speak to a manager our server scoffed...telling us he was the manager and literally waved off my concerns and rudely stormed away.  I have never been so irritated by the lack of respect or concern this manager showed.  I would be embarrassed to hear of the poor treatment this manager shows customers if I were the owner of this establishment.  Maybe the carefree attitude worked for awhile, but the 6 new establishments around the Ohio city area are more than willing to provide excellent customer service, booze and food.  We will never return to the old angle as nano brewery and Ohio city burrito smacked us in the face with quality and kindness and not to mention better prices! Consumers do NOT have to settle for sub-par restaurants/bars as there are certainly much better places to spend time. If you want to play with fire and risk ruining your evening, this is the place for you. Otherwise, STEER CLEAR!"}
{"text":"Best football (soccer) pub in Cleveland! Arsenal fans not welcome, great people and food."}
{"text":"meh.  people love this place. the food is better than bar food, but not anything to write home about.  the atmosphere is bar. bar is an adjective now.  meh. if i didn't go to the old angle again, i don't think i would cry."}
{"text":"I think Will S. summed it up very well, but I just wanted to give an enthusiastic \"hear, hear\" for the Old Angle.  Last night I met fellow Yelpers, drank affordable and pretty good beer (and Original Sin cider), had a place to sit, ate yummy fries, and our group was attended to nicely by our server.  Plus, I've heard they play rugby games, which doesn't really matter to me, but which will eventually lure my husband to this place.  The crowd was pretty large, but not overwhelmingly so.    An added bonus: when I got there earlier than anyone, and sat at the bar by myself while I waited for a familiar face to come through the door, I wasn't given weird looks by either the bartender or the fellow patrons.  Overall, I really liked the vibe of this place a lot."}
{"text":"Great irish bar. Going there for years. Bartenders are awesome. Good and friendly local crowd. Good irish pub fare. I am not a huge soccer fan but know that it is the place to go and it gets packed early. Nice place to watch other games too- lots of tv's and decent seating. Good staple of the trendy and sometimes obnoxious west 25 bar scene."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best soccer bar cleveland has to offer. It is a hidden gem on west 25th and has some of the most authentic Irish fare around. I come here once a month on Saturday or Sunday to watch English premiere league, bundesliga, la liga or any sporting event. Usually visiting the West side market before or after eating. The open around 10, maybe earlier, but they only serve beer. The kitchen opens around 12 or 1230, at least on the weekends.the beer selection has the classics and some craft choices like fat heads or great lakes.  Food-wise, I have never had a bad meal. The buffalo basil chicken wings have outstanding flavor. The fries are always cooked to perfection, hand cut, come with house made ketchup and are generous in portion. All the sauces are made from scratch as far as I know. The craic head sandwich and the grilled cheese are reasonable prices, and consistently delicious. No need to order extra fries with either one. Even the mac and cheese is great, with a ton of cheese and very filling.    If you are looking for a soccer bar with fish and chips, shepherd's pie, or bangers and mash this is the place to be. I would not bring kids here for a soccer game, unless you are fine with a roudy pub atmosphere. It is dimly lit but it scream authentic Irish pub. There is a warm fire place, plenty of big screens, and they always have sports on, like a sports bar should. The service is world class as well. If you see a guy in a green old angle shirt walking around, he makes this place go.  Come for the soccer, stay for the food  and keep it our secret! Supporters of any club welcome."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is homey, quiet, and offers great food. I am a little annoyed by the OSU crap that they put up during football season, but everyone has to make a living I suppose. I will probably lose 50% of my friends for calling a giant inflatable Brutus \"crap\" but I believe that in the war against hooknasties and hambones, there will be some regrettable casualties.  The Old Angle is not a sports bar; it is a pub where you can catch a game (most apt to be soccer) and drink a pint while enjoying really, really good grub. Their pub grub is top notch and worth stopping in for, with or without the pint.   To make a long story short: if you want to go to Ohio City and haven't experienced the Old Angle, go. Now. Leave work early."}
{"text":"My mom and I adore this place. We went back in July but I'm just now writing a review. I had the fish and chips which tasted really fresh and my mom had grilled cheese and the salad was fantastic. I also got some type of Jameson cocktail which was delicious.   I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Great service here despite coming during an Ohio State game! This is definitely a sports bar more than anything else, but drink prices are decent ($6/beer, for most) and their menu is great for lunch and dinner. There are plenty of TVs so you can get a good view of whatever game you're coming to watch.  Portions here are really good for the price, and the fries are delicious! Service was also super fast. I think I'll try coming here more often, but perhaps not on a huge game night."}
{"text":"I think this is considered a \"local bar\", but in the sence that the \"local\" are actually normal human beings that are not scuzzy.  Usually when I think local bar, I think that I would be comfortable in a sweatshirt.  This is not the case with the old Angle.  It is a classy establishment with a local feel.  The previous reviewer was righ on when suggesting to watch a soccer game there.  That is the \"type\" that would be there.   It's a nice place for food, to meet after work, to go out to on a weekend, to meet up with an old friend, to go to a first date on (it's actually kinda romantic) or to watch a game.  Very versitile."}
{"text":"I went to the Old Angle on thurs night and had a great time...the manager was very funny and nice..the food was great and came out quickly.......I love this place and will come back every thursday that I can"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently decided to head to Ohio City and do things we hadn't done before. We have our stomping grounds we are comfortable with but as Ohio City grows it keeps bringing in more awesome places to check out.   I have probably walked by TOAV numerous times but really, I am unsure why we have never stopped in before. It's a tavern and they have nice curb appeal which means I am usually 1/2 in the door already. Upon entering I was even more shocked- it's a great space. I am not sure what I was expecting but nonetheless, I like this place.  We pulled up a spot at the bar and ordered some beers and also watched some of the soccer game on. I could tell this was a neighborhood bar kind of place. The bartenders knew everyone and were really friendly. Service was quick, chatty and seemed glad we were giving them our money.   Definitely check out the sandwich place in the back. This place rocked my sandwich socks off! I don't even know what we got but dang was it good with my guinness.  Sandwich was pricey- $13 but SO worth it.   We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am loving The Old Angle!  The man & I have been here several times in the past, but usually on Saturday mornings at the cusp of being too early for a drink.  Always the same bartender, Matt, is there and & he's super nice, helpful.  Great bloody Mary's here, and great beer.  This is a European pub to be sure.  Football (SOCCER) is always on the telly.  Old Speckled Hen and Bass is on tap and well of course, Guinness!  A few weeks ago we were starving, post run, and post shopping at the West Side Market and decided to order some food.  OMG!   The Potato Leek Soup was outta sight.  (Yep, I said \"outta sight\").  The man ordered the D'Angle which is their version of a Reuben and Holy Corned Beef!  That was the best corned beef I've EVER, EVER had!!!  The fries are great too.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese which had tomato & bacon on it.  YUM!! YUM!!!  I had the Guinness Battered Onion Rings and those were excellent too, especially with the Guinness mustard.  They have some great vegetarian options, and of course the traditional \"Bangers & Mash\" to go w/ the theme of the bar.    I suggest you head your hiney over & go get some great food & booze!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Its has a huge bar that streches the lengh of the room. its all wood. nice seating areas. Its a really good atmosphere, but they don't really have any \"cheap bar food\" so be ready to actually eat food and pay for actual food. I went with my friend and husband on the night of a Cavs game, back in the playoffs. They pull down a screen and have it projected up on the wall.  Its a nice big screen and really allows you to watch the game from anywhere in there. It was also packed with people cheering and yelling and slapping hi-fives to each other. Its a nice environment, but the beers are a bit on the expensive side. however, it was still easy to get beer and food at any point, even when the bar was hard to move around in. They do a good job of keeping you full of beer and good food even when its packed.  The food is warm comfort food (stews and lots of meat), with alot of IRISH mixed in. Its good place to just feel  warm, it is a nice place to just hang out. It doesn't make effort to be exceptional in any way, but it does a good job of just being a clean, comfortable, slightly nicer priced bar around the corner."}
{"text":"This is a great spot on w.25th. The food is so good each time and good service as well. Also they make the ketchup in house"}
{"text":"My favorite place in CLE. Good food, good bar,good location, nice people. The jewel of west 25th"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch at The Old Angle Tavern today.  We spent the morning shopping down the street at The West Side Market and we were looking for a fun place for lunch.  There are lots of great options on West 25th but we wanted to try something new and we're glad that we did!  We got there just as they opened at noon and pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We sat at a table near the front windows and did some people watching while we were eating.  I had a corned beet sandwich and my husband had a pulled pork sandwich.  Both sandwiches came with fries and all the portions were huge!  We both enjoyed our sandwiches and the crisp french fries but, oddly enough, the best part of the meal was the ketchup!  While the sandwiches and fries were delicious, the ketchup was over-the-top good!  And I'm not even someone who particularly enjoys ketchup!  We asked the server and he said it was house made, along with the mustard, coleslaw and almost everything.  I took half my sandwich and fries home -- and I was sure to snag some ketchup, too!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent bar on 25th street in Ohio City.  This place is simply huge and can handle a ton of patrons.  I've never been there when it is really crowded, but if it were I'd imagine that it might take a while to get drinks.  However, each time I have been there, it has been simple to get a drink at the bar, or a short wait for the waitress to serve me.    The band last night, however, left more than a little to be desired.  I am all for live music, but sometimes the jukebox is just the better idea.  There was no cover charge, though, so I guess you get what you pay for.  And, it was still better than the crappy piano at Howl at the Moon over in the flats."}
{"text":"Matty was the best! We were out-of-towners, but he made us feel right at home. Perfect place to watch EPL. Love that there were so many Man City fans in Cleveland. And Spurs fans were very entertaining. Loved the songs!  Clean pub. Good food. Excellent and friendly service. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Cleveland.   Hey, Matt, if you ever move to Louisville, bring your pub with you! Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest bars in Ohio City...  THE UP-SIDE: Great, semi-healthy, bar-food in a nice atmosphere.  The service is always a pleasant experience.  THE DOWN-SIDE: Once a week, they feature the same solo guitarist.  He's not that good and his singing can really crush the great atmosphere the place has going.  Try to avoid this time.    THE SUM-IT-UP: A terrific place to hang out in Ohio City.  You could go to the Garage across the street, but why bother?  The Angle has everything you could ask for in a decent-sized corner bar."}
{"text":"Pretty solid spot. Very comfortable kind of place, especially if you happen to be sitting near the fireplace.   The mix of music was cool - from Neil Diamond to Joy Division. You could actually hear yourself and others speaking, which is always a plus in any bar.   Beer selection is so-so. They had La Fin du Mond - which is one of my favorites. I wanted to switch it up, so I got a Cocaine Lady (which is similar to a White Russian and has a splash of coke in it) after my beer. And this is my only complaint about the Old Angle: I was charged for a White Russian and then charged for a Stoli Vanilla as well. The adorable bartender asked me if wanted that, to be fair, but I didn't know I'd get charged for two drinks. I probably should have said something about that and I'm sure it would have been fixed. Oh well, not a huge deal really.  Really awesome atmosphere, good company, adorable bartenders, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks. Not usually prepared to handle any sort of crowd early in the week so you'll wait fooorrreeevvveerrrrr for food and refills... But the servers and bartenders are really nice so it makes up for it.  And don't have to go to the bathroom ever. The smell is nauseating in the basement. Even with the stinky bathroom is gets 4 stars. I recommend everything, never been disappointed with an order. Especially the pulled pork sliders!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, surprisingly exceptional food. Lamb sliders were the best we've ever had !  Super friendly service, excellent drinks. Funky old decor, but that adds to the grunge bar feel. Went to see Austin Walkin Cane on Friday night happy hour. Awesome slide guitar player"}
{"text":"How did I end up at the Old Angle Tavern? Its where my sandwich from Bogtrotters was delivered. And I'm glad it was because the Old Angle Tavern was a really neat experience. I loved the old decor. It reminded me of those old neighborhood bars that were on every street corner in Chicago back in the 70's. I had a great time hanging out with the locals, cheering on the Indians.   If you're looking for a fabulous, local bar that has a retro feel and friendly vibe, The Old Angle Tavern is the place to go. Its a great place to sit back, relax and enjoy a cold one. Its like going back to a simpler time when your biggest worry was where your next draft beer was coming from. Personally, I miss those days."}
{"text":"Yep, five stars.   I'm updating my review because I've noticed that many places I've reviewed (and loved) are now closed. The Dredgers Union closing was a big blow. And I actually liked at first how the Dragonfly Lounge tried a different vibe than everyone else. But it too is gone. So is Phoenix Coffee on West 9th. How did it close? It was the best coffee house in Cleveland.  That said, the Old Angle is immune. As others have pointed out, it's more than a bar. I am not that cool of a guy, but the bartenders always act as though I am, and make most everyone feel welcome.   I came here to call the police, passing up many other places with telephones, after having a gun in my face while getting robbed. Maybe this place makes you feel safe. Roaring fireplaces have that effect sometimes. They also gave me a set of shot glasses after my stepmother passed away. She loved the Angle too, despite only being there a couple times with me.  But, this is a review site, so I'll get back to the point.  Their shortrib sliders are the best food item on West 25th Street. Order them. Tonight.  I can't imagine a pub able to consume more Powers whiskey than this place. They've even got me drinking it sometimes. They would be able to defeat any bar, anywhere, in a \"Powers-Off\" (should have done that during the blackout. Man, do I need to be in marketing).  That is all."}
{"text":"It is a great neighborhood bar.  4 years ago, I deducted a star for dirty bathrooms. They've cleaned them and they don't stink anymore.  The food was surprisingly good.  I finally ate here, before I just drank.  I wanted to take all the stuff from a sandwich (vegan), the guy wouldn't fill the order.  He said it would be bad. He made me a veggie quesadilla instead and it was terrific.  I was hangry so I ordered fries.  Cooked in pig fat, still want them?  No.  And thank you.  5 stars for service, honesty, and clean renewed bathrooms.  The food/drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Those 2 stars are a gift!  We stopped in here after a trip to the Westside Market for lunch. We got there shortly after they opened and were the first ones there. The bartender/waiter didn't seem at all happy that we were there. While we were sitting there another family came in and stood by the door waiting for the guy to seat them. After about 5 minutes of them standing there and with him nowhere to be found they walked out.  We both ordered the corned beef and all I can say is I've had better. I love corned beef and I could tell this stuff was at least a day or two old and just warmed up and done so the wrong way. The fries were good but I'm not going back for fries.   It's a shame that a place in that location was so bad when everything else around there is pretty good. I give it 2 stars cause the place has potential to be really cool. Maybe it is. Maybe I was there the wrong day. Better employees and better food is all this place is missing which unfortunately are pretty important in the restaurant business...."}
{"text":"A Great Neighborhood Bar.  This is one of my favorite places to go in Ohio city.  My friends always want to go out by my place because I live so close to the Angle.  The food is good, the beer is good, and the service is normally good.  When it gets crowded service can be a little slow. Great for a night of drinks and fun with a group of friends. Definitely a neighborhood hang out in ohio city.  I recommend: The heated roast beef the d'angle (corned beef sandwich) anything with french fries the fried ravioli the lamb stew Cosmopolitans the seasonal rotating beer  hit or miss: flat bread pizza  Avoid like the plague: hot ham sandwich. (too much ham can't taste the cheese)   Overall: Great place for a relaxed night out."}
{"text":"Plenty of TVs and a great place to watch sports if that's your thing. Food is delicious! Had the chicken pot pie and it was mouth watering! Good beer selection, and good crowd. Not douchy like the other bars on w25th on the weekends."}
{"text":"Still my favorite bar in the world. I've taken to calling it the \"corner office\".  As Ohio City becomes infested by all these new suburbanites and W. 6th assholes (thanks a lot, USA Today), the Angle remains the one refuge in my neighborhood that is still relatively tolerable on weekend nights. I truly hate that Ohio City is now the new \"trendy\" place for the worst drinkers in Cleveland to hang out. The Angle is still for professional drinkers, not amateurs."}
{"text":"This is one of Ohio City's great little places. Great fish n chips. Service could be a tad better but man they have good food! Im impressed."}
{"text":"Jess and I visited on our first foray into the west side of town since moving back to Cleveland. We really enjoyed this place. It's definitely the shotgun bar setup, with the long bar on the right. We were there from maybe 3 pm on a Saturday afternoon until about 5:30. It was a pleasant atmosphere and the servers were really friendly, telling us all about their favorite places in Cleveland. UK beers on tap and Jess got to try a dry cider she never had before (\"Original Sin\"). Overall a great place!  Pros: Chill atmosphere, good beers, great part of town. Cons: They had a lacrosse team there doing a fundraising/benefit jobby. Our pleasant afternoon was ruined by soccer/lacrosse moms wearing buttons on the sweaters with pictures of their kids in lacrosse gear (gross). Definitely not necessary and even though I never thought I'd be that person, I don't like it when kids are around (it's a bar for heck's sake!). Eh, guess I'm a square now, but Jess agrees.  Next time we're in Ohio City, we'll be back...plus it might even be when other people are consuming copious amounts of beer (like Saturday EVENING instead of afternoon). Try it out, yo!"}
{"text":"The farm to table meals on the list of specials tonight were awesome. The homemade chicken potpie was worth the 27th review update of this place. My man ordered the slow cooked pork over whipped mashed potatoes--both meals came with fresh baguettes. Keep doing what you're doing guys!!"}
{"text":"I like The Old Angle, but I am so mad that I just have to complain somewhere.  The place's website won't let me.  Try it--it won't work!  So I had two brain aneurysms and a stroke late last year.  Before that, I was a whirling dervish, had been the Angle, took out-of-towners to the Angle...the whole bit.  Right now, after the stroke, I am expected to make a full recovery, but I have no balance.  I see weird, I walk weirder, and I don't drive.    The bartender at The Old Angle wouldn't serve me because he thought I was drunk.  I wasn't drunk.  We just moved down the street with people, astonished people.  My friend tried to explain what had happened to me but he wasn't having it.  Did I say I was a bartender?  I am, and I would do the same thing at first.  But I would talk to the person (I can talk) and see that I am reasonable and, uh, normal.  He wouldn't talk to me.  I am normal, my brain is just dumb and doesn't always tell my body what to do.    This was like three weeks ago.  I plan on going there - its locally-owned, it's right there, I did like it, but that really sucked."}
{"text":"Had a Friday lunch at Old Angle--the only day of the work week they are open for lunch.  I had the Char-Grilled Burger--a 1/2 lb. patty with grilled onions and cheese for $10.  I thought the burger was solid and filling, especially with the big bun used.  The hand cut fries are about par for the course, and the plate also comes with a thimble of nondescript cole slaw.  While the was food just decent, I liked the space the tavern is in: spacious with big tables and a couple of big flat panel televisions on the walls with (at the time) ESPN Sportcenter and soccer.  I think the nice environment kicks Old Angle up to low three-star range--though among my recent lunch spots I actually prefer Leader Bar & Grill on Superior."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Old Angle Tavern because I am a big fan of Bogtrotter's Doorstep which is attached to the bar. I walked in, tried to order a drink, one bartender was busy doing shots of Jagermeister with some customers. When the other bartender rolled by, I ordered then he fulfilled some drink orders for some customers who appeared to be regulars that had ordered before me. It took me 20 minutes to get a can of beer in this place! If you are not a regular,don't go!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Old Angle a lot... and in the beginning, I was not a fan at all.  The service was mediocre at best and I did not seem impressed with the service.  After they worked out those issues, things definitely did change.  Good food, better service, great beer, great decor and ambiance and soccer.  I highly recommend checking it out if you are a fan of good grub, soccer and great beers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were new to Cleveland, so we decided to try out this bar. We were only in there for 2 minutes because the bartender swiped our West Virginia ID's and claimed we had fake ID's. We told him that wasn't right because we were both 23 years old, and our West Virginia ID's don't swipe, they scan, like a barcode. He told us that his machine was, \"state of the art\" and that we needed to leave. I guess most people would stand their ground and argue, but we didn't bother. We are 24 now and never returning."}
{"text":"UPDATE: the food actually is real good! Onion rings were the bomb and I got the corned beef sandwich too. I recommend both. Do it."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST establishment in Ohio City. Don't waste your time going here. Walked in on a Friday night with a group of 10 when they had about 10 total people in the bar itself before we walked in. Apparently the bartender has never seen a non-Ohio ID before and wouldn't serve my 31 year old brother because he thought his NY state ID was fake. All patrons there were rude and told us to go to another bar. Really explains why you had zero business on a Friday night. You pushed hundreds of dollars out the door because of stupidity."}
{"text":"Shepherd's pie is pretty awesome. And I love the decor. In Cleveland, on a soccer game day, this is THE place to be."}
{"text":"Cute decor, loved the bookshelf and living room feel. It was intimate and cozy. Beers were cheap, could have been because of the OSU game, but still. Good locaiton on W25th. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Dim lighting, mahogany furniture, tall ceilings covered in tin, stone tile flooring, a cozy fireplace and dark red accents abound, this Gaelic inspired Tavern has a sort of Medieval personality to it.   Located in the heart of Ohio City, The Old Angle can be easily found on the main drag of West 25th Street, just next to Ohio City Burrito. My first visit was to meet with other local Yelpers. I've since returned to bring a group of friends prior to a Cavs game. On both occasions, we were treated to extraordinary service with great food and drinks.   The bar offers a limited quantity of draught beers, but each of the tap offerings seems plenty adequate to please most Irish pub dwellers. The bottled selection is abundant and consists mostly of quality craft brews, including a local favorite of mine, Indigo Imp!  The menu is well balanced and consists of not only classic Irish mainstays, but plenty variety for the health conscious and dietary restricted.    I consider myself honored to have been introduced to The Old Angle. And unbeknownst to many of our suburban friends, there ARE downtown dining options outside of Flannery's, The House of Blues and The Hard Rock Cafe, and it just so happens to be located just across the Hope Memorial Bridge among the other popular destinations in glorious Ohio City.   Old Angle, I look forward to my return!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Superb, and Outstanding! Is the only way to describe our experience. My husband and I stopped in for the first time, and it won't be our last. The food, the service and the care taken to make or experience was one, we'll never forget. Hubby was feeling a little under the weather, and they offered and made a Hot Totti like your Gma would. The pulled Pork 10/10, jerk chicken sandwich 10/10, wings 11/10, fries 10/10, sauces10/10, house made pickles 15/10. Fantastic meal & deal! Glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Keep taking this down Yelp and Ill keep writing a new one.  This is how I feel about this place.  Management can keep reporting reviews instead of actually FIXING the bartenders. Read Paul R review as well.  I'm not the only one who knows the bartenders here act like its their friggin playground...go to Edisons late on certain nights and watch them in all their glory..  Place has really changed. Shepards pie is still good and they have the same macro Irish/British beers you would find anywhere. Burger was done right last time but the fries taste like butt. When they first started they went for the local Irish, neighborhood feel. Ive seen Boys From Co Hell play here as well as other good Irish bands. Now its morphed into this w.25th cheesey/jock/frat/college/preppy/tweaker/tourist place. Its new urbanites trying to re-live their college days. Drive by on a sunday and peep all the people in Ohio State or Browns gear milling about sloppy and chain smoking outside. If 25th had a sports bar, this would be it. Its like the Barley House Downtown but the bartenders are still up from the night before. Anyone in the biz will know them by name.  Come on whiskey night and watch them keep up with the patrons 1-for-1.  If your in their little clique they hook you up bigtime.  If your not, your the only fool paying for drinks at a full bar.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Poor service and crappy food. I went with two other people and none of us likes or finished our meals."}
{"text":"Visited on business from Cincinnati, wasn't expecting too much. Was pleasantly surprised! Great staff, beer selection and enjoyable people. Will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"Went here after a wedding reception for a 2nd reception with the guests and bridal party.  We were in a downstairs room with its own bar. Very cozy and the staff was helpful.  I don't drink but the staff provided me with free cranberry juice, so I'd say they were accommodating.  Seems like a great place to sit around and watch the games.     Its in a good location, was very easy to find and parking was a breeze."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese was fantastic. I have no words LOL! I believe it was only $8, and you got a hearty, big sandwich with amazing fries. The fries were crispy and deep fried to perfection. The cheese was ooey gooey, which is a technical term and a must-have when you're eating any kind of melted cheese. Of course, just to top it off, there was a pickle served with the sandwich, yum!  The ordering process was pretty easy. Even though there were about 150 people at the bar (no joke), there was no line to wait. You go to back where there's a counter, order, and the guy tells you to return in about 10 minutes. My sandwich was ready on time, as promised.  I did not buy my drinks, but I did stick with vodka sunrises all night. They were refreshing in flavor, but not too fruity. I don't like it when cocktails are made with so little alcohol OR you can't taste the alcohol (which can be dangerous!). These cocktails were made on point though. I wouldn't mind returning again!"}
{"text":"Went for soccer (MLS Col Crew) but they were distracted with March Madness so focused on the food and drink and it was fabulous. Only topped by the waiter who suspiciously acted like he owned the joint (aka: fantastically happy, helpful and attentive).  I'll be back for soccer soon and food and libations of a hoppy kind!"}
{"text":"I went here for my first yelp meetup !   Although the Old Angle looks like other 'Irish' bars/pubs at first glance, he Old Angle stands out above the rest of them.  The crowd was much more subdued than I have encountered (drunk frat boys) at other 'Irish' bars.   The beer selection was solid although with only 5 [all microbrews] on tap, they have a very wide bottle selection with domestics and microbrews. Their prices were reasonable for Ohio City, most 16oz drafts (microbrew) for $4 or $5.  Their discounts on happy hour covered a wide variety of mixed drinks (about a dozen of them), shots, beers, and Irish whiskeys (even aged Jameson). A few happy hour appetisers rounded out the menu (I only nibbled on a couple fries, which were tasty).  Additionally, their happy hour menus were available and clearly listed all of their items - something that I don't see enough.   Despite the busy Friday Happy hour, our server was very good.  He forgot to bring a water for me after requested for one (and seemed to disappear for a few minutes) but he made up for it afterwards by bringing carafes of water for our table afterwards and attended to us much more.   He was happy to give us separate tabs for 6-7 at the table.   I'm glad to go here."}
{"text":"Great place to go to watch a soccer game in comfort and enjoy tasty food. Good atmosphere and friendly staff, although sometimes overwhelming during soccer games."}
{"text":"Quintessential British pub experience in Cleveland.  A friend who frequently visits London was immediately impressed with the British pub inspired  food menu items.  The drink selection is varied, you'll be able to find something for everyone to drink.  For vegetarians- menu options are limited, as expected from a British pub.  They have mac and cheese, grilled cheese, and veggie quesadillas.  I had the veggie quesadilla and it was tasty.    If you're a soccer fan, this is the official home of the Tottenham Hotspur (an English premier league team based in North London) so they're always open for Spurs game, and it draws a decent following.  Kitchen opens at noon, so what's nice is that if you're there earlier, the owner does not mind if you bring in your own food.  Super friendly staff, an outdated but old British looking scene, solid food.  Go Spurs!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star place for W.25th street.   Its a great place for a beer and to watch the game, or if you just want a quick bite while sitting at the bar.  The people working are super.  They listed all the happy hour specials and I think somehow I ended up getting a free $2 Tecate can the other day.  Each time I end up in that area for whatever reason, I always find myself coming here for one.    I read all the 4 star reviews left for this place and completely agree with all of them to some capacity.  Make it a must stop if you are in the neighborhood and have an hour or two to spare.  Walking distance from West Side Market."}
{"text":"This bar is in a great location in Ohio City - nice chill atmosphere and so awesome with the front windows open in the summer letting in that lake breeze. Eurosports (football, rugby, etc) on the TVs is a nice touch.   Employees are all super cool. They sponsored our rowing team (Thanks Alex!) Service is great too - all servers I've had here have hustled their butts off.   Menu is pretty good in my opinion. Standard Irish bar fare plus creative additions. Salads, wraps, etc. all great. Even the chicken strips are not your regular over-breaded, over-fried mess. And you get 3 different sauces (choose from 5) with them. Yum. Especially liked the garlic mayo.  The only thing I find weird about this place is the decor. A lot of the place reminds me of an Italian restaurant rather than and Irish pub. It's like half and half. Upholstered panels on the wall for an elevated dining area with fancier tables on one side, but regular pub-type tables in the front where the windows are. The downstairs where the bathrooms are is really really cool and dungeon-y,  though and there's a private room with its own bar that seems like it could be rented out.   Overall, a nice neighborhood spot with friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I were hankerin' for a brew and a burger last night and just happened to stumble on The Old Angle Tavern in Ohio City.   Imagine our surprise when we stepped in, only to be greeted by not only a warm staff, but also a warm, cracklin' fire. I immediately thought the place was a delicious blend of neighborhood bar, medival inn and sports pub. Very cozy, chill and oh-so-familiar. The Indigo IMP Blond Bombshell I ordered just added to the warm glowy feeling I had about the ambiance.   Admittedly, our char-burger was a little more aggressive on the \"char\" than we typically like. However, the Guinness Onion soup was D-E-L-E-C-T-A-B-L-E, thus proving that everything is indeed better with Guinness. The turkey chili was also quite tasty...a difficult feat when dealing with a largely bland bird.   I'm going to reserve a higher star rating until I'm able to sample more of the menu. But, if first impressions count for anything, I'll be loving this place in no time flat! Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"One of the top bars in Ohio City. Totally comfortable atmosphere, friendly and casual. GREAT food, strong drinks, experienced bartenders.  Nice big TVs for my boyfriend to watch sports. Try the lamb taco special on Thursdays... delicious!  Love the front tables with the big windows open!   Only downside: They no longer have desserts. :("}
{"text":"Cool little place. Kinda loud. Does have a little bit of Chi'town feel....just a little. The menu is tiny! Wing, fries, couple of sandwiches and 1 or two \"specialty\" items. Shouldn't go here looking for a lot of variety. Service was really good. One guy covering the bar and mid afternoon Friday crowd. He never missed a beat and was a nice guy. Bbq pork sandwich and fries (gut buster) worked out nicely. Tender and great smoky flavor...big chunks of pork.   Don't look for their menu online anywhere. It doesn't exist. Oh, and no sliders. FYI."}
{"text":"A group of us visited this bar on a Thursday evening for food and drinks. When we entered there was hardly 10 people in the bar. We took a seat and the server took our drink order. My friend asked for a lime and didn't get one, she asked again when he checked in but 10 minutes later when he took our food order but still no lime. We went up to the bar and got it ourselves, no huge deal. After 45 minutes had gone by we still didn't have our food. We could see the food sitting in the window at the opposite end of the bar but our server was nowhere to be found. After 10 minutes sitting in the window the server appeared from behind the bar and brought our food.   How disappointed we were. My friend got fish and chips and the coleslaw had sat so long in the window that her batter was soggy. My girlfriend ordered the chicken toes and they came out a dark brown and black at certain places. By this point we had enough, we waited almost an hour for our food and when it came it was a sad disappointment. Our server came over and we asked to speak with a manager and the server told us he was. We expressed our frustration with how long the food took and how disappointed we were with the food and the server/manager without skipping a beat turned around and walked away from us mid-sentence. We waited to see if he'd come back but he never did. We paid for our drinks with cash and went next door for dinner.  We felt disrespected when our food took so long and the server/manager never came to say anything, never asked if we wanted another drink in that 55 minutes and then when we voice our concern he turns his back and just walks away. Maybe we went on a bad night but that manager needs a lesson in hospitality. My friends and I will never go back to this establishment as it was one of the most disappointing experiences I've had at a restaurant.  I'm only assuming the manager has no financial investment at the Old Angle because if he did he wouldn't have treated his customers the way he did."}
{"text":"We were bar crawling in Ohio City recently when we looked across the street at the Old Angle Tavern.  Since we had never been there, we decided to venture into the unknown and we were pleasantly surprised.  The waiter and bartender was super funny and friendly and he's from Parma, just like me.  The beer selection was good and surprisingly, the Wit beer I ordered came in a can, but was really delicious.  I love Wheat beer!  We didn't try any food, but we learned that there is a Sunday soccer club that meets here to watch games.  That sounds fun.  The basement is cool and rentable.  The Old Angle has medieval or castle theme going on, which we liked.  I can't wait to go back for a full meal!  Love the friendly, unassuming, down to earth atmosphere."}
{"text":"Buy one get one shots of Powers on Sundays and complimentary pizza.  OF COURSE 5 stars.     Only complaints: With all the stairs involved in locating the bathrooms, you might want to limit your amount of free whiskey.  Also, with the patio accessed by climbing out the window, see whiskey advisory above.  Have yet to eat here, but I love the wood bar, decor, and the layout of the bar.  Makes easy for groups to intermingle."}
{"text":"Update - As West 25th grows trendier, so apparently does the Old Angle - and in my opinion that's not for the better. The tartar sauce I raved about before has changed. The food portions seem to be smaller, and without surprise, pricier. The chili-cheese fries are also gone. Overall, now, I really wouldn't go out of my way to get to TOAT, and that's saying something since I live only a couple blocks away and with walking could bypass parking problems in Ohio City. But meh, there are similar places to go, and so I shall, and leave TOAT to the crowds on W. 25th that seem willing to pay just to be in the happening spot, and overlook authenticity."}
{"text":"This is another place I didn't want to try, 'cause it looked like the type of sports bar that attracts loudmouthed lames.  Boy, was I wrong.  We watched the great tragic Olympic hockey finals here (Ryan Miller deserved a better game) and everybody -- those putting the beers on the bar and those throwing them down their gullets -- turned out to be the funniest, smartest, friendliest people -- quoting everything from obscure historical facts to Dr. Demento.  Just like the staff at the nearby West Side Market Cafe, these bartenders know their customer's names.  They have Smithwick's on tap and that is one fine, smooth ale.  I didn't get a chance to try the food, but it looked great -- huge portions, lots of leafy green stuff with the meat, and the sandwiches were served on huge slabs of fresh bread. Located in the really cool historical funky Ohio City neighborhood, right near the iconic Market."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been at a place that was more rude.   We had a rather large party and were standing by the door because we couldn't find anyone to seat us. Meanwhile, I don't think a table there seats more than 4.. After about a few minutes of not seeing an employee, we sat down and moved two tables together. The bearded fellow who eventually acknowledged our existence made snide remarks about our having moved a couple of tables together (there was only one other group of 8 sitting at tables that had been moved together). We left before ordering and moved the tables to their original position. We weren't welcome for whatever reason and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The Old Angle is where people who live in the neighborhood go to drink said numerous bartenders who live in Ohio City. I have never had a great time there nor has it bummed me out. Irish bars are not really my thing. Polish bars like Post 58 in Tremont are. The inside of Old Angle looks like a castle. It is worth stopping in to eat a Bogtrotters sandwich and enjoy one last beer before heading home."}
{"text":"Had a very positive experience here. Just came for drinks, but everything was reasonably priced (especially in comparison to the bars surrounding it). Our bartender was friendly and knowledgeable and stopped by our table every five minutes or so to check on us. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I love Mac & Cheese and this is one of the best takes on Mac & cheese. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. I was unable to finish all of the noodles. Honestly, I am going to go back for this dish alone. Beyond the food the service is great. The waiter was very attentive to us despite having a large crowd."}
{"text":"Both the quality and the price are five stars. I had the D'angle corned beef sandwich with fries on the side. Mere words fall far short in trying to describe this wonderful dish. The lovely Avril took wonderful care of me and my sister. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"You've all walked by.  There is that ominous looking wooden door in the basement near the bathrooms.  I always had figured that it was to some kind of closet or possibly a torture chamber?  Actually, it's a long thin private party room.  They rent this out for free so long as you can guarantee enough people.  They may have even thrown in free food from what I recall.  It was great!  I especially liked it because it's cozy, they were more than hospitable and they let us do karaoke!  Yeaaaa!!!!  So anyway, now you know what that room is...it's a bastion of joy and debauchery."}
{"text":"The Old Angle is a great West Side establishment. It's a decent size so it's great for big groups to meet up, but it's not overwhelmingly big like Cadillac Ranch that feels more like a compound than a bar. The Old Angle is the perfect place to catch a television event or game. I, myself, have caught a few Cavs games with friends and even the election night coverage with a bunch of my fellow politicos. The food is more than decent for bar food and the bartenders are very attentive and friendly. I like that the Old Angle isn't too done up or done down and has just the right amount of cheesiness to make it a perfect neighborhood go-to-whenever-you-feel-like-it-no-matter-what-you're wearing bar."}
{"text":"I have been on a life long search for the perfect Mac and cheese. The Old Angle Tavern delivers with the best Mac and cheese anywhere around. The atmosphere is very reminiscent of the Irish taverns I saw on a recent trip. It's also a good place for a good pour of Guinness. Top notch!"}
{"text":"If you are into friendly corner bars with unexpectedly good, fresh food instead of fried bar food, this is your place.   The ambience and charm of a corner bar with upscale, farm to table food . The prices may be a little pricier than what you might expect from a divey sort of corner bar, but oh so worth it.   This place is clean, comfy and friendly serving some great dishes like lobster roll, homemade meatloaf, deconstructed pork shank tacos and many more.   Do yourself a favor when in the W. 25 area and walk in here. You will be greeted with a friendly smile and some darn decent food."}
{"text":"This is a great location and a fun bar to hit while you are in the W 25th St area.  I haven't tried the food here, so I can't comment on it.  The service is pretty good for a busy bar but you can wait a while if there is a crowd.  Just be patient and enjoy the fun!"}
