{"text":"I frequented this bar -a lot- in my early twenties on the weekends.  Now I'm back on Saturdays, only during the day, for what I consider one of the best game-day specials around.  For OSU and Browns games, the special is $20 for all-you-can-drink draft beer (Miller Lite/Coors/Bud Lite) AND a dozen wings.  That's a heck of a deal; I don't know why they don't advertise it more!"}
{"text":"Overall a good bar. Would not call it a restaurant. Only complaints are the damn small plastic cups & overpriced drinks- there are never any drink specials. And they beed to cool it with the \"slutty costume\" events- lakewood is not that kind of place-"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and it was my first time. They have EXTREMELY rude staff. Soon as I came in to get my ID checked, the guy who checked my ID throws it on the floor and says ...\"that's how I feel about your ID\". But I walked away. Not only that but when I went to get a drink, the bartender didn't ask me for ID, but I went to get a second drink ...she then checks my ID. I didn't understand this. Their drinks are too expensive and serve your beer in disposable cups. This will be the first and last time I'll ever go to this bar. Never had an experience like this until now. I don't recommend this bar at all. Dissapointed at how I was treated"}
{"text":"I went to Around the Corner on a weekend night in the summer, and while it seemed like it could have been a perfect place to have fun in theory, it was just too mobbed and loud to have a good time with friends.  If I wanted to grind on the dance floor among blackout drunk people, I would go back to college.  The patio seemed nice, but I'd rather check it out on a day or night when there's less belligerent traffic."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. My husband and I stopped in this place on Saturday before a wedding to have a few drinks. The server charged our card and we went on our way. I check the bank account today to find that they processed our bill TWICE! So, I call to speak to Ryan the owner and of course he's not there. I get told that he doesn't haven a normal schedule and that I would have to call back and try to catch him in order to find out why it was processed twice for the same amount. Then the older gentlemen I spoke to decides to tell me that it's the processing company and that's how they do things and that I should wait 3 to 5 days for the second pending charge to come off. I can be sure to say...I WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK AGAIN! A $64.00 tab turned into $128.00 tab.. So instead of running your card for the one tab they run it twice he stated. THAT'S BULLSHIT!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are fairly cheap, service isn't bad, but NO TANKS. WTF. This place acts like its some 5 star restaurant. It's a bar with hermit crab races, guys who vape, and essentially a large communal urinal that doubles as a piss river. 

The one time I was allowed to wear a tank the bouncer said \"I'll allow it, but I don't like it\" and then would stare me down every time we walked past me. 

I can't help it that my vascular arms just look so good in a tank top. It's really a shame that my people continue to be discriminated against and this establishment facilitates it."}
{"text":"Good beer prices, food is great, and patio is fun during the summer time.  Buffalo chicken wrap is the best I've ever had.  This is the perfect spot to watch a game or hang out for an evening."}
{"text":"I love the brunch but the rest sucks. It always smells really strong like alcohol everywhere whenever you go and the bathrooms are always nasty. Hipster hang out!"}
{"text":"Different place depending on when you come in. Mon-Thus beer and food specials make this a great deal for those who like go out early. 

Lots of complaints about the young crowds, but it's much older and even family friendly up until around 8-9."}
{"text":"A group of us went for Sunday brunch and had a great experience.  The food was awesome and it was a beautiful day to sit on the patio.  The waitress was very friendly as well.

...However, the first time we tried to eat here, we stood at the front door confused for a good 5 minutes, were never approached and ended up going somewhere else...Might be a good idea to have someone at least near the front entrance in order to direct people."}
{"text":"Service sucks,. Had to go to bar to serve my own drinks.  Ordered chips and wings waited over an hour for service.  The owners are missing and don't care."}
{"text":"Have been to Around the Corner frequently.  Stopped at ATC on Sunday to watch the Browns game.  I had a sandwhich and 3 Southern Tier Pumking Ale.  Very surprised to find out I was charged $9 a cup for beer.   I agree it is good beer, but $9 a beer is at least $3 or $4 too much. Especially at a local establishment that has good, not great food"}
{"text":"First off the drinks way over priced 5 $ bottles come on guys you can do better then that ??

Went there for dinner and got the chili. It was pretty good 
Then went back later on and was surprised on the completely different atmosphere good for dancing"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer. However, at the end of the night I had a drunk worker yelling at me telling me that I could not use the bathroom because he has just cleaned it (it was 1:50 am so they weren't closed) and ended up flicking a lit cigarette at me and threatening my friends. They need to monitor their workers drinking habits while on the clock. I will NEVER go back again and that sucks because the food was really good."}
{"text":"I would give this place less than one star if I could.  Stopped in with my husband.  He had three miller lites, I ordered one drink.  When I paid the tab, there were two shots on our ck., which we did NOT order.  Bartender became very nasty and argumentative insisting we drank them.  We don't do shots!  

She put someones shots on our tab!  No tip for her.  No response from mgmt.  Thieves!!"}
{"text":"Worst brunch ever!  Don't  know how they can even call it brunch?????  I have had a better BREAKFAST at a grease spoon!  Server was rude, eggs were floating in grease and they were out of champagne so NO MIMOSAS's!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on New Year's Day.  The place was surprisingly dead.  The service was good, and my food was good.  A few people at the table got the stuffed french toast, and they all said they wished it didn't have the marzipan in it.  Seemed like a good deal for the amount of food.  Bathroom was dirty."}
{"text":"I died and went to heaven for their brunch. I am not gonna lie ... I hate ATC as a bar. It's always too loud and has a certain smell to it that I thought I left behind in the college bars. So when my boyfriend suggested we go there for brunch because his sister LOVES it, I was a little hesitant. But I will try any place for food at least once. 

After I got over the smell of stale beer, we settled into the small booth for breakfast. They even put little table clothes on to make it look nicer. Mimosas, blood beers (not sure what that is), and a bloody Mary bar were all offered. I stuck with iced tea and my boyfriend for coffee. The menu was a lot larger than I imagined, and I ordered the South of the Border Fritatta. It took a little while for the food to come out, but it was well worth the wait. I got cheddar cheese instead of jack cheese and double bacon, no sausage, with my meal. It was way too much food but I couldn't stop eating. (And they did bring out our fruit cups first). I'm a huge hash browns person, and I couldn't stop shoveling mounds of the deliciousness into my mouth. 

While sitting there, we heard the couple in the next booth talk about a Groupon they had for brunch, so we ended up looking it up and getting the same deal. $11 for $20 worth of brunch/lunch. It was such a good price, even without the Groupon, for all the food, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Just had Brunch today on a Saturday. I was a bit taken aback when seated outside --- very warm and somewhat buggy but bearable. But ...when the food arrived ....awesome! The omelette with cheese, tomato, bacon, onion was juicy and large. The bomb..... was the Coconut Pancakes --- 3 Herculean cakes with real and abundant coconut! They came with ---get this --- a fruit compote which it did not need and ....bacon, sausage and potatoes --- extreme gluttony! The food for 2 was meant for 4-6! And it was delicious. Our waitress made it even more pleasurable with her smiles and positive attitude. I will be coming back and I will be much hungrier next time. The quantity and quality of food was extraordinaire!"}
{"text":"So we tried this place twice. The first time we sat inside and had wings and skins... it was typical pub grub and nothing special. The next time we thought we would try it again because we found a groupon and it was close. So we went for Sunday lunch... They have a very limited menu on Sundays and even more limited staff. They front was closed for a graduation party and after awkwardly being asked to move we went to the back patio. It was filled with the aroma of stale cigarette smoke, which is always nice to dine to. They staff looked as if they had rolled out of bed from the night before or slept in the back room. The manager sat in the large beach chair in the corner and played on is his phone. Will not be back and it wasn't worth the groupon."}
{"text":"We came for our ohio wing tour. This was our second stop in cozy Lakewood Ohio. The menu said award winning wings. So it was worth the try. I tried three flavors: the black pepper rub, garlic Parmesan  and the sweet Carolina. All three were very good. The black pepper was a little salty. But the sauce was good and the black pepper was there but not overpowering. 

The garlic parm was a really good sauce as well. I felt like the Parmesan was overpowering the garlic but it was a nice change from most garlic sauces I've tried. 

Finally, my favorite, the sweet Carolina sauce was fantastic. A honey mustardy slightly vinegary sticky sauce was just what I was looking for on our quest to find the best wings in ohio. A great sauce that works with wings but a unique flavor profile that makes it stand out from every other wing joint."}
{"text":"This is a casual place to get beer and wings. The beer prices are not the cheapest but the food is decent. They usually have some sort of music act especially on the weekends. The best thing here is their happy hour is from 3-7pm and the patio is large and a great spot in the summer."}
{"text":"My favorite bar/restaurant in Lakewood! All of the food is amazing, especially the wings! They make the best green tea shots. Best patio around, perfect for summertime. Very chill, laid back atmosphere & the weekends are so much fun! Love coming here to watch the Cavs, Indians & Browns. All of the servers & bartenders are so cute & nice & provide great service. Highly recommend for any occasion!"}
{"text":"This place would not be my pick for night life, with the Abercrombie & Bud Light crowd, but I am here to write about the brunch. It's pretty decent, definitely better than what you'll expect from a sports bar. I did well with the South of the Border frittata. My wife loves the coconut pancakes with berry compote. Most meals get sausage, bacon a big hunk of toast and a fruit cup appetizer. Portions are huge, expect leftovers.The coffee is average.  It isn't Pier W but it sure beats a Denny's."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Great wings and an outdoor patio in the summer.  Plenty of entertainment.  Check out the crowd.  If it is your \"type\" you will have plenty of fun.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up for happy hour with friends....nighttime is a meat market. Seems to just be a bunch of people saying \"look at me\" crammed together....especially the outdoor area. 

Nighttime regulars....no. Annoying. Daylight afternoon crowd with a bite to eat, yes."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better, or maybe I had lower standards. Very limited draft beer choice, if Coors lite is my order, choice is pretty lousy.  Sat at the patio bar and almost had to beg to be waited on. Food was mediocre, standard bar food. I know this place gets hyped as a hotspot in Lakewood, but they really need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Their very, very popular patio has great hambone and hook-nasty watching in the summer. All the kids from River are home from college with their collars popped and on the prowl."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a while now. First, it's like three bars in one. Great classic bar in the front with plenty of TVs and a good bar. The patio is perfect in the summer. In the shade and plenty of room at the bar. Then the party room for big games - had a big friendly cavs crowd for the championship game. You can see the TVs from every seat. 

About the wings - easily the best around. Big and cooked to a perfect crisp. Good sauce and dry rub selection too, but the key to perfect wings is the wing quality and how you cook them. They have it down."}
{"text":"Plastic cups?  Really?  Do I look like I am about to wile out and go nuts or something?  Thus place is stuck in the college years.  Although... The wings and a cold Summer Shandy on tap while sitting on their back patio never suck..."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for many years, but my friend & I decided to catch the tribe playoff. Went to the patio and got a table...no acknowledgement, so went to the bar for service. Then got a server, no names but a very beautiful girl. We ordered the sampler, ugh! 12.99 for frozen apps most likely from a bag purchased from GFS...bogus! Wings were good though only 3 were included. Split that evenly between two people?...then, not to blame server, there was no specific detail as to what happy hour meant. So sitting at a table right next to the bar, we were not able to get the same prices as if seated at the bar (with 1 bartender totally in the weeds!)  Then prices made no sense for drinks (in disposable cups?) Overall, very disappointed...good wings, nice server, but you need to have better mgt/training and maybe rethink the overall quality of your menu. Fresh made??? Yeah/no. That is the new thing you know! Also, save the planet...stop using all the disposable stuff!!! So sad. Will I be back? Mmm, don't think so, too many other places to choose from...sorry!"}
{"text":"A Lakewood institution.
The bar food, especially burgers and wings are above average.
Drinks are slightly overpriced in comparison to most other Lakewood bars.  
The patio is one of the best in Cleveland during the summer although it gets uncomfortably crowded with a younger (21-26) crowd."}
{"text":"Little better than average food. Great outdoor sports bar.1"}
{"text":"If you are a person who enjoys going to a bar that has slow service, sub par food that serves drinks in plastic cups, offers food in plastic baskets, and use plastic utensils...then i guess this is a place for you. 

Extremely hard to find, and this is clearly a dive. The service is very slow and the food was \"ehhhh...\" 

I will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Went there one Saturday night before the crowd came in. The waitress was a little all over the place, not very attentive at all. Waited 20-30 minutes with a friend to place an order. I ordered the garlic parmesan wings. With hearing all the talk about how good these wings were, I was very excited for a bunch of buttery, garlicy, parmesany goodness. I also ordered a side of Cajun fries. The food was done rather quickly which I appreciated. It's always been the little things that matter to me when ordering food. If I mention that I would like a side of honey mustard or ranch, and if the waitress remembers I know she's good at what she does. This one did not. When she came to check on us about 15 minutes after the food was delivered, she asked if we needed anything and I mentioned my honey mustard and my friend asked for ranch. She comes back with honey mustard and a packet of blue cheese.. Close. The wings had a good amount of meat on them and I can see how people say they're good, but the garlic parm I had in front of me was actually in a red sauce and was pretty spicy.. Not at all like I expected or was told from friends. Maybe there's a new cook or something? My lips were on fire as I finished eating the wings, I felt like I ordered a dozen hot buffalo wings. The fries were tasty though, I don't think anyone could mess up fries though.. When it came time to leave the bar was a little more full with people and we couldn't find the waitress anywhere. Went up to the bar to pay and they couldn't find our orders. After 10 or so minutes of another lady calling our waitresses cell phone she walks by and rings us up and away we go. Definitely not a smoothly operating bar when it comes to food and customer service, at least not this one time. On top of that, the vodka drinks my friend and I ordered tasted like there was little to no alcohol in it.. I'd go again if friends were there and I'd eat if I were hungry.. but definitely not a place you'll hear me wanting to go."}
{"text":"What a cool bar! 

This bar is so big and has lots of different areas. If you want to hang with friends, it's perfect. If you want to dance, just go to the back and you can!  I love the variety of it.  For that reason alone, I will go back.  Decent beer selection and I have not eaten there but it's great for big groups to just go hang out in the evenings. Very cool place."}
{"text":"Guys, it is what it is, a fun bar with one of the best patios in Cleveland, and their food specials make it a great value.  By the way, every time I have been there the staff has been great, always friendly and accommodating, even when my son is running around the patio like a mad man.  Great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"The black pepper wings are the greatest wings in this country. When The founding fathers were piecing together what would be the future of this great nation, they had this exact spot in mind."}
{"text":"Love coming to the Corner for a good time with my friends! The atmosphere is always fun and their black pepper wings are the absolute best!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice/romantic night out with my fiancé and stumbled across this establishment.  Couldn't be more disappointed. The napkins were so stiff. The waiters must use those as blast rags.  And the women...don't get me started!  All were fast n easy. This place gives a whole new meaning to \"crab races\""}
{"text":"Nice place, with some ok burgers, but decided to try their perch dinner. I'm sorry but I'm from Cleveland and this was the absolute worse perch I have ever eaten. You might be able to pull off bad Lake Erie Perch in another city, but not here in Cleveland. There's no way this is fresh Lake Erie Perch!!!! Look and tasted like something they bought at a grocery store, threw on a pan and heated up in the over!!!! Real fresh Lake Erie Perch has taste to it and this simply had NO taste to it at all. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
If you're in the mood for a burger, then yes, check this place out, but if you've got a taste for fish, REAL, fresh, Lake Erie Perch - don't bother with their idea of it here because you will be more than disappointed."}
{"text":"I have only been here for drinks, but I love the atmosphere. The bar in the front usually seems pretty chill depending what events or live music are taking place. If you are into patios this bar is a must. The patio is very large and has a totally different vibe than the bar in the front. The scene is is definitely on the younger side. Great bar to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Went here Wednesday evening 6:30. To finish the Tribe game. Went to the outside bar, sat there for 10 minutes, and the blond behind the bar ignored me. She walked by me at least a dozen times. She didn't even greet me. Place wasn't busy the but there was a animal benefit starting.
With all the competition in Lakewood and in Rocky River, I can scratch this place off!"}
{"text":"Two words: Coconut Pancakes.
 
What? Why are you still reading? Doesn't that say it all? No? Well, I also enjoyed the South of the Border Frittata which was stacked with guacamole, cheese, salsa, and goodness. And the sausage gravy over biscuits were a delish heart attack on a plate. 

The brunch prices are quite reasonable, although the drink prices are a bit over the top. But I can't say enough how the food well exceeds my expectations. Portions are huge, and I never leave without a to-go box.

 It's a bit divey yet charming on the inside and I can't wait to partake in more brunch-aliciousness."}
{"text":"Went to Brunch on a Sunday and was pleasantly suprised. Bloody Mary bar, Mimosas and nice simple menu. Got the O.T.C. omelette.... Wow!  Huge portions with bacon, sausage, and hash browns!"}
{"text":"Decent corner bar...

THE UP-SIDE:
Nice corner bar with good bar-style food.  Servers are usually pleasant and hard-working.  In summer, always sit on the back patio; great feel to it and much more fun.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
Food isn't anything spectacular (but good for a corner bar.)  

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Yeah, I go here every once in a while to just kick back with friends on the back patio.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"They have crab races at night sometimes so that's different. At night it's a riot, a younger crowd than nearby bars. I have to be in the mood to go here.
I also went for Sunday brunch and had the eggs benedict which was pretty good. What was really great though was the service. The waitress kept all our waters and coffees full at all times and was always there when needed."}
{"text":"Clearly one of the most happening, young, crowded watering holes on the Westside. I usually only tend to stop by with a group and when its incredibly busy. The outdoor patio and stage-bar area are excellent to drink and socialize and dance. Summer nights are fun. 

I once watched someone try to pluck a Lobster out of the Catch-a-Lobster claw game. Drop in some money, position the claw, watch it drop on a live lobster just to see it slip away as the claw ascends. Definitely funny to watch with a drink in your hand. If you can catch one, its yours to eat or otherwise... I think. 

If you like fun, crowded, loud, drinking and dancing this is a great summer, westside spot."}
{"text":"I'm surprised these reviews lean low... The thing is, this bar is rad. It's got several different areas including a great back patio/a huge music stage/a small front stage a small party room etc etc... I've been here dozens of times and there are probably rooms I don't know about. 
It does have a young crowd on the weekends, but it's fun to be around young people. And yes, they have plastic cups, it's a bar, who cares? If you want glass go to a pub. Am I going to eat here? Probably not, but I know people who have, and again, it's bar food. 
It's like when I rate a vacuum place, I'm not going to rate it low because it isn't fun and doesn't sell pizza. It's in it's own category, and this big bar is on the top end of the big bars category."}
{"text":"Interesting menu but the service is slow and the food is consistently lukewarm to cold when received. A frittata received with the cheese obviously cold and congealed and the hash browns cold. Love the menu but even the best food served cold leaves one disappointed."}
{"text":"A good place if you are in the mood for a burger or wings. But otherwise a relatively short menu. The burgers are HUGE and  well prepared. Several standard options. (I like the signature burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and American cheese.) Be aware, fries are not included and have to be ordered. 

Lots of good wings. When it's busy, ask for your wings well done.  I like the Around the Corner Signature Wings. A black pepper rub with some mildly spicy  butter sauce. May be one of the best wings in the area. 

Monday is 2 for 1 burger night. Such a deal!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a few of my friends. The place has an outdoor patio with a bar and a live band! It was packed ...filled with college kids and cheap drinks. Your average crowd of 20 somethings and a few oldies in there. The music changes every time you move to a different room and table booths were available to sit. The lights are dim inside the bar but once you go outside towards the patio, there are xmas lights decorated around the place. Outdoor seating is available as well but because it rained that night, everyone sort of huddled around the tented area. The only other active thing going on that night were the crab races. You get $, a shot, and a beer if you guess which crab wins the race. 

It would be nice to have a pool table or darts so people can actually have something to do then sit around and watch other people. Other than that, the ladies restroom were absolutely disgusting. No toilet paper or paper towels...just horrible. I'd only come again for the cheap drinks but there are other places I can find for that."}
{"text":"Brunch. I get excited to try new places on Sundays. After this morning I would have loved to be at one of my favorite dives for their $2.99 grub. 

Unless this is your first day on the job, you should know that when people walk through the front door someone should greet them. And if you are the manager, you can feel free to say hello and ask how many vs telling your employee to do it in front of the customer. Ugh.

Today seemed to be a busy day. But that's what you look forward to right? Everyone seemed very rushed and everything done with minimal effort. We decided on the Hangover Omelette and the Eggs Florentine. After a long wait, we got our meal. The omelette was massive and ok. Alas, it came with chewy bacon and the \"Texas toast\" was a slice of a baguette. Chewy bacon? No thanks. As for the Eggs Florentine, I wish I took a picture. It came in a skillet. Think Eggs Benedict. The english muffin, I needed a steak knife to cut. The Canadian Bacon was super salty, topped with an egg with the hollandaise sauce on the side. Now add the creamed spinach with mozz and parm. Well it was swimming in the creamed spinach and cheeze. Disappointment. Without asking how things were or if we needed another drink we were given the check.

I'll stick to drinks when I have to visit in the future."}
{"text":"Everyone in northeast Ohio has to try this amazing bar! It has a positive, relaxed atmosphere. It's perfect for people of all ages, both young and old, and even a great place for a quick family dinner. They have the best wings in the area, and Erie island flavor is a must have for everyone! The service is excellent, all the waitresses are friendly and know what they are talking about when talking beer. Awesome expieriences, awesome service, awesome food!

P. S. The ultimate fries are sooo bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"After a few more tries, I am set to finally update my scathing review from years past. The experiences I have had as of late, really have changed my view on this place. I am so glad I gave them another chance to make good. 

First and foremost, they have one of the VERY BEST patios in Cleveland. Anyone who knows a lot about Lakewood, knows that patios are scarce. But the patio here is massive, clean and has an awesome outside bar. If you like to dine outside (or are a cornhole player) then this patio is right up your alley. And literally, it is right up an alley!

I have to say, if you like wings....this place will rock your socks....put the wind in your sails....fly your kite. Well, you get the picture. The are amazeballs with extra sauce. Meaty, crispy and the sauces they have are FULL of flavor. Our favorite sauces are the black pepper rub and the sweet caroline. I know I know, you are singing the song right? Thanks Neil Diamond....... on Tuesday and Thursday the wings are $.49 with a minimum of 10 per flavor. No other purchase required...void where prohibited.

Do you like mussels? Then I recommend you get these too! On Thursday's they are $.15 a piece and that was the exact reason I gave them a shot. Low and behold, they are super yummy. They come with a garlic, tomato and butter sauce all over them. They are cooked well and a decent size for the price. We love them!

 I am a huge salad freak. This place does salad correctly. Not any of that iceberg crap...this is the real deal. Baby romaine mix with fresh veggies. I also LOVE their blue cheese dressing. Really yummy!

Service can be spotty depending on who is working, but overall it is good. I gave them 4 stars because the bathrooms are old, gross and smell funny. Update them and you have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Around the Corner is your standard bar with a fairly standard bar menu. When I'm visiting my mom this is our last resort - no creative thinking place to stop. They've got great burgers and reasonable prices but they are seriously lacking in service.

If you stop by in the summer be sure to sit at the patio."}
{"text":"One of the best places to relax in Cleveland during the summer on the their huge patio. Always an entertaining event happening in the warehouse but somehow this old bar/restaurants keeps its hometown family atmosphere at the same time."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We arrived at 1:40 pm and were told we could only order brunch until 2. I had looked at the menu online so I was disappointed that I could not order what I  wanted. We each ordered a diet cola and never received a refill. I ended up getting the  breakfast burrito with bacon, cheese and apple. The bacon was layed inside in strips and was too rubbery to cut without a knife. The apples were a sugary cinnamon compote. Served with obviously cheap frozen hash browns."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely terrible. Bartender Natalie Ignored us at the front bar for 15 minutes and walked away in the middle of out order once she finally acknowledged us."}
{"text":"Been going here for the last twenty years but the last time we went the entertainer was so loud we couldn't order. Noticed several tables asking it to be turned down but the entertainer refused. Great wings, will go back."}
{"text":"I hear this is the kind of place you go to have a random-ass, good time. Well, that's true, with their huge patio--but I don't think I'll be coming back for food. 

The man and I stopped here for a quick bite before our thrift/vintage shopping spree... you know, to fuel up! The server was nice, but totally overwhelmed with just three tables to serve. Beyond that, the service was painfully slow.

When we finally got our food, it was really subpar. My partner's hamburger was a square-shaped, grey patty. My fajitas were burnt to a crisp and had a funny taste, although the chicken was nicely cooked. It was just... not good. In fact, the man next to us must have been new to this place and shouted, \"It feels like I'm eating inside of someone's old boat shoe.\" I don't think it was that bad, but he seemed to think so..

I will say that I hear their wings are pretty good, so maybe if I ever eat here again, I'll stick to those. I saw two men at the end of the bar enjoying them and I didn't hear a peep out of 'em! 

I can see the allure of Around The Corner for great, late night (and cheap) drinks on their patio. I've been here in the summer and the most silly, unexpected and fun things seem to happen out there! It really is a hoot to see, so don't focus on the food. I mean, it's just pub-grub anyways. 

P.S. The bathrooms seem to have been redone recently and aren't nearly as bad as I'm guessing they used to be based on what I read."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but never made it to the outside patio.  What is it out there? It's a whole different world out there with live music & silly dancing! 

I mean, do we really have to convince you that this place is a riot? There is hermit crab racing ... yes - I said it.  You can place a bet on a hermit crab and cheer it on as it crawls it's way to the outside of the circle.  I felt sad for the crab, but also excited by the process.  It was confusing. 

Great for late night fun!"}
{"text":"We tried to go here for the \"I hate Valentines Day\" theme night advertised at the Cupids Corner Bar and we were told it was closed for a private party. The facebook page said that the bar was still open 2/15 until 2am and no mention of a private party. Next time please put something on Facebook or at least have a sign at the bar... It was very disappointing as we were looking forward to visiting. I attempted to contact the bar via their Facebook page but they ignored my message, and when I left a review, they removed all reviews. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food for brunch is amazing and the bloody Mary bar is great.... But the service is absolutely atrocious.  What's worse is its consistently horrible, it's common knowledge for brunch goers in the area know how bad the service is.  If you do decide to eat here just block a good 1.5/2 hours out of your day."}
{"text":"The food was edible and we had an okay waitress. I'm not overly impressed with the bartenders ability to make drinks or shots. Our entrees came out before our appetizers and everything was just average. Nothing life ruining but nothing incredible either. I would recommend this place to someone who just wants a patio and doesn't care how  their food/service/drinks are."}
{"text":"We had quite a group of people for brunch. They were very accommodating and helpful. Our waiter even took photos of our group for us. I had eggs benedict with a spinach sauce, which I thought was outstanding. I would recommend them for Sunday brunch in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I've had a good time.  The bar is fun, but the food isn't that great.  The outside patio wreaks of fried foods--I think the fryers vent out in that direction.  The moment I walked outside, I felt like I walked into one of those tiny Chinese take-out joints that   smells like nothing but deep fried egg rolls.  The smell was a bit overwhelming for something that's outside.  Inside didn't have the same odor problem.  There's not a massive selection of microbrews, but the bartenders were friendly and quick.  The bar was fully stocked and everyone seemed nice.  I don't think I would go here for dinner, but I would hop over for drinks with friends and maybe some wings."}
{"text":"ATC is a neat joint to grab some food and drinks. I recently moved to Lakewood and have been looking for new spots to grab a few drinks, watch sports, or grab dinner! ATC has daily food specials, with .49 cent wings Tuesday & Thursday! I have come here a number of times and my food has been consistently good with great drink prices ($6 pitchers 3-7). The service has always been friendly and quick. Natalie, a bartender I have worked with a number of times, is very welcoming and personable. Truly no complaints so far, slowly becoming a favorite spot of mine to visit! 

(Pictured are the Dijon-honey mustard & hot garlic parm wings)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had heard that around the corner served a surprisingly good brunch so we went to check it out. The booth we were sat at was small. I'm not the skinniest guy around but the booth was so small my girlfriend and I were fighting for leg room under the table. 

I got the Hangover omelette which consists of an entire meal of breakfast (sausage, potatoes, cheese, ect.) inside of a gigantic omelette. Seriously, this thing had to be a 5-egger or something. It was also covered, absolutely covered, in sausage gravy. It was good and came with a small fruit bowl and a side of bacon and toast. It was also $10. 

The price was not a big deal per se, but the fact of the matter is I would have paid $5 for half the food and would have been happy and full. The place was surprisingly loud for 11:30 on a Saturday. 

All and all I can't say I won't be back. The food was good, not great but enjoyable. With so many places that do breakfast and brunch in the area though, it tough to compete."}
{"text":"I have been going to ATC for years! It has taken a nose dive. The food is no longer good. The wait staff are ok.  There is one waitress with VERY long hair and SHE PLAYS WITH IT CONSTANTLY!!   I can imagine hair ending up in the food. Where is the management team?

I will go back because I love the outside seating. However, I hope the beer stays cold and the long dark haired waitress stops touching her hair!!"}
{"text":"Decent patio (in the heyday, it was King) but food is just average.  Wings use to rock, but lately just average.  Menu seems to have been the same for the past ten years and could use a face lift."}
{"text":"I had the cheddar burger...got sick. The bun was stale. The zucchini fries were not to good. My friend got the goat cheese salad and the goat cheese came fried. Beer was brought as draft, make sure you ask for a bottle of that is what you want. Bands are great to listen to but food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here for another Trivia Night.  They are on Thursdays at 7 PM (might run a little behind) and it seemed to be quite popular.  The host tonight was filling in for someone, but he seemed to do an ok job.  There were about 4 rounds with about 7 questions each.  First couple of rounds were random and then the last two were  on music and then sports.  They also had a 49 cent wing special going on with 15 cent mussels.  I've had the wings before and they were amazing.  I usually get the Spicy Garlic Parmesan but this time I thought I'd try BBQ because another table had ordered them and they smelled and looked so tantalizing.  However, when I got mine, they were so cold that the sauce on the wings were cold....not very appetizing.  Our server was really nice and helpful though.  She offered me some new ones, but I didn't want to wait for them to cook since my friends and I were leaving soon.  She ended up just taking them off the bill, no worries. I gave the mussels a try and they weren't that bad considering how cheap they were.  They offered them in two different styles: Garlic Butter or Marinara.  I went for the Garlic butter.  Even though I only gave them three stars for this visit, I have faith in Around the Corner to turn it around on my next visit."}
{"text":"Its a fun dive bar in Lakewood. The crowd filled up with goofy frat guys dancing all over each other. I came for the band which was great, Lt Dan's New Legs."}
{"text":"We to ATC for brunch and it was not good. Ordered the southwest omelet. It was a plate of sad eggs wrapped around giant mushy globs of store brought guacamole, LOTS of sour cream a ton of cheese and canned salsa. Did I mention there was  LOTS of sour cream and cheese. It was so mushy one would not need teeth to eat it. It came with tasteless hash browns, a chunk of toast and some bacon and sausage. My favorite part of the meal is when the waitress took my plate away so I didn't have to look at the food any longer. Yikes."}
{"text":"Been here many times for wing crawls and brunch.  Even happy hour. Its OK.  Bartenders are OK.  The beer selection is nothing more that you would see in a college kids dorm.  The black pepper wings and even those (half the time) are oily and burnt.  If you cant get on the right day they can be great.  Lakewood has so many other options.  Parking here stinks.  If you have a coupon its worth it, other than that...not so much."}
{"text":"Popular bar with the 'main stream I don't care if everything sucks' college aged kid types. The space is great (large patio, some interesting architecture) and there's a big crowd on the weekends. Wish the music didn't suck so bad (even if it's tailored toward the mainstream type). Party Rock anthem remixes in the \"dance\" room is rural bowling alley music status."}
{"text":"Young people tend to fear the proper suburbia. It's this mysterious place where rockers and pot-smokers and boozers and artists all settle down and never, ever leave its confines. It's an island, cut off from the mainland by PTA meetings and lawncare. 

Walking into Around the Corner is like walking into that nightmarish landscape. Not too far from the rest of the world, it sits in the dark, serving the same patrons day in and day out. The beer selection is your standard fare--once you've left behind expectations of microbrews and specialties. White haired grandmothers sit beside budding young mothers, the servers look like they need to escape a few towns over. It's only a permissible place to drink and eat if you have no other options, like so many of the sad suburbanites."}
{"text":"I'll say this that they have a great outdoor bar and eating area that's nice even during cooler days and evenings because they turn the heaters on. It's usually a summer time hangout on a Friday night after work. The bar staff is very friendly and totally takes care of the customers with complimentary shots. Food is actually good with specials all the time. Usually drink for a while and order later. 

If there is one negative is that I hate the parking in this area. They have a few lots on westside of the bar that fill up fast and then there's a struggle to find decent parking and one has to settle for parking on a side street. Not good. 

Lakewood bars are great because of the age appropriate group and mixture of people."}
{"text":"I've been to ATC many times and I have to say it's one of my go-to favorite bars in Lakewood. I like the fact that there's three rooms and each one is a different atmosphere. If you go in the main room there's usually a live band, booth seating and a long bar. Keep walking through and you'll get to the outside bar. In the summer this part is hoppin'. In the winter it's just a bunch of people smoking in an \"outside\" area (it's tarped off).. which I'm not a huge fan of because it stinks. In the summer the outside bar is my favorite though. Next to the outside bar is the second inside bar, this one usually has a DJ, and a big dance floor. There's always people dancing like idiots in there (cough cough me cough cough) and it's a fun time. I like to get drunk in the outside bar then go dance crazy in the second inside bar. Plus the bathrooms are in there so it's better.

The bathrooms are really annoying, only two stalls for all those people! Whoever designed that should probably be shot. Besides that, this place is great. Cheap drinks, good crowd (some douche bags but much better than going to downtown Cleveland West 6th let me tell you!)... There's usually a lot of cute guys here too. 

Overall, this place is really fun, I've definitely had plenty of good nights here and forgotten to close my tab out quite a few times and had to do the walk of shame in the morning. Don't worry they don't judge you too much :)"}
{"text":"Around the Corner.... 

Keep in mind this, like all yelp reviews, are subjective. 

(I've never had their food, this review is based solely on my experiences there on Weekend nights). 

With those caveats out of the way, Around The Corner has been packed every time (~6) I've been there. Set-up wise, there's a large dancing floor and an outdoor bar [and space heaters out there in the fall, a plus]. Beer-wise, it's Great Lakes, leinenkugel [score for me], Blue Moon, and the domestics. 

Every time that I've been there, it's very busy. Waits for the bathrooms (there are two of them) but I commend the staff for somehow keeping it clean considering the amount of customers. Considering the large crowd, service at the bars is all right. Some of the times I received my orange with my Blue Moon without asking, some of the time they did ask, sometimes they don't ask and don't give it. $4.50 for a short Blue Moon ?! I didn't know Lakewood began charging a price premium. 

There are crab races on 2 nights a week. You pay $1, stand around a large poker table, and with an MC/official, root on your crab to out 'run' the others to the finish circle. Can be entertaining, especially if you're not sober. 

It can also get entertaining to watch the hooknasties barely able to walk in their stillettos out of the door, but the entertainment can wear off fast. 
The music is top 40 from the 2000s with some very popular 'classics' (I'm using that term broadly here) from the 70s, 80s (hang on sloopy, journey, bon jovi). 

If you're into the scene that I described above: a large crowd (from 21-40 ages, with a slight majority college-aged) with its share of popped collars and hooknasties, music, and prices I mentioned, then add a couple stars to my 2.5. I'll admit: the atmosphere doesn't just jibe with me well, But it's just not that place for me."}
{"text":"I have been to ATC mutiple times now, but this was the first time I had ever ordered food. I would say the food is pretty average bar food. I ordered a burger and fries and my boyfriend ordered the chicken quesadilla. The services was great even though it was really busy. We never had an issue getting more drinks from our waitress. I do wish she would have told us the drink specials before we ordered because we would have gotten the special and saved around $10. 

Late night at ATC is always fun. They have multiple rooms so there is something for everyone. I always enjoy the live band they have inside. A good cover band is make or break, and they always have entertaining bands! It can get extremely busy, so I have to be in the mood to be around a lot of people. All around ATC is a great place to go hang out with friends, grab some drinks, and listen to live music!"}
{"text":"AWESOME. Pretty crowded but I love the atmosphere. Between the crab racing (that's right...crab racing) and the great live music, who wouldn't love a party night here? The patio is a great place to hang out and have a good time in the summer.

This is very much a party place though. So if you're in the mood for a quiet place to hang out with friends and booze, this is not it. The live music makes the side bar extremely rowdy and hard to get service.

I haven't had the food, but I've heard it is quite good. I would definitely try some given the opportunity."}
{"text":"You know how everyone calls Lakewood the \"college town without a college\"? Well, this would be the big frat house on campus.  I describe this place as a \"bro-bar\" to my friends who have never been here. It surprises me that the guy that owns Georgetown owns this place too...I always got the feeling the inside of the place was just dirty every time I went, ESPECIALLY the bathrooms (have they been re-done? If so, I haven't seen them yet). I typically go outside on their pretty big outdoor patio that they have, and it's nice they realize that the greater Cleveland area does have cold weather from time to time, and they do have one or two heat lamps out there for those chilly nights. 

I think the biggest reason this bar reminds me of a fraternity is because of the dance floor/room, whatever you want to call it.  I just think of the random big room where the frat guys would push all the couches out of the way, play some music and have a couple colored strobe lights. That's pretty much what that room is like, with a bar in it. But, when my friends ask me where is somewhere local they can go on the west side to dance without going downtown, that's really the only place I can think of. Either ATC found a niche or I haven't been to enough places to find one where you can dance...like that..(....without going downtown).

The service......eh. Hit or miss. Sometimes they're good, other times it feels like they're serving everyone but you and they are doing it while they hate their lives.  I came here once and ordered the sliders--probably won't be doing that again. Didn't care for it. Came here another time during Lent for a fish fry.  Now let me tell you, I do NOT like seafood, put the perch was super good! My girlfriend got the cod, and I think I would like a couple bites but not the whole thing.  I have never been here for brunch, but, I have heard that the brunch is super, super good. Can't comment on it though.."}
{"text":"I've always thought of Around the Corner as a great spot for a night out with friends. They have a huge space and something fun always going on. From hermit crab races to their many bars to live music, there really is something for everyone. 
     Recently, I purchased a Groupon for food and decided to give their brunch a try. I was not disappointed. I ordered the hangover omelette, which was delicious. It's an omelette filled with sausage, hash browns, cheese and topped with sausage gravy and served with Texas toast and bacon..what more could you ask for?? It was about as big as my head, and I ate the whole thing- it was so good!
     Service was good- we were the only people there so I don't have much to base it on, though. On a normal night I think their drink prices are a little much, but their brunch and good prices seem reasonable."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - I went through a phase where I was at ATC every. single. weekend for about six months. That doesn't mean it's the best, it just means I was always there. it's best described as the kind of place where, once you walk in, time stops and you're in your own little universe. That's not necessarily a good thing. 

ATC on a Friday or Saturday night is the equivalent of a college party transported to a bar. it's great because there are the three rooms - the main bar you walk into, the patio, and the Warehouse Room, where there's either a live band or a DJ - but just because there is space, doesn't mean there's room. The place is PACKED in the summer, and it's hard enough to move from one room to another and not lose your friends in the crowd. You need child leashes in here to make sure your group stays together. The crowd is VERY diverse - bros, bachelorette parties, sports fans, older patrons, groups of friends having a reunion - everyone is here. If you sit in one place for most of the night, you will be approached by any and every type of person possible. It makes for good stories, funny conversations, awkward moments, and more than one \"help me I need to get out of here\" interaction; this goes for men and women.

Drink prices vary at the bars from room to room. The front bar is usually cheapest, but moving there to get drinks usually means giving up your prime spot on the patio. It's a toss up. It's helpful to head out with quarters, as most drink prices are in multiples of 25 cents.

Dancing in the Warehouse Room is fun, but do watch out for phantom dancers. If your goal is to dirty dance with a random bro who grabs your hips out of nowhere, you're in the right spot. If you want to just dance with your girls, be prepared to fend off the dudes. Live bands are less threatening than the DJ on nights with dancing if you want to keep away from grinding attacks.

There is cornhole outside in the back, which is WONDERFUL. It's quieter out there, as it's behind the walls of the patio, so it's a nice option if you want to be out in the summer but avoid the craziness of the rest of the bar.

Bathrooms are disgusting. There is one stall in the ladies room upstairs, so you get to make a lot of friends while waiting in line. There are three stalls downstairs, but those floors are usually wet and covered with toilet paper. Pick your battles.

One of the biggest draws, though - crab races on Saturday nights. For $1, you can pick and race a hermit crab and win money, drinks, or food vouchers. DO IT.

I came here once for wings on a Thursday, which were pretty good. The crowd was definitely less intrusive during the week. it's a decent place to watch a game, as there are a number of TVs throughout all three rooms.

Overall, I think everyone needs to go here at least once. It's an experience, albeit one not everyone will want to repeat."}
{"text":"I love to dance in the warehouse but I hate the way it smells like hot barf. 
I would appreciate a sense of crowd control and would recommend a cover charge for the warehouse to detour \"onlookers\", of people dancing. 
This is the place to be if you want to dance and have a good time on the west side.

Holler if you'd like some more lucrative business tips to help this place reach its full potential!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars to hit up in the summer!! They have the best patio in Lakewood and amazing food specials during the week. Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday are all  .49 cent wing nights and the wings are phenomenal. They have bomb DJs on the weekends in the warehouse and they even have hermit crab races. Around the Corner has something for everyone. The service has been top notch every time I've gone here. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Your typical Lakewood bar (read: not very good). I ordered artichoke dip. The tortilla chips that came with it were stale but the dip was ok. I should've requested something else but I was too hungry. The drinks are overpriced - I was charged $9 for two well drinks which I thought was way too much for this kind of bar. Douche-y clientele and bartenders."}
{"text":"I ordered wings here at 6:40 pm by phone for a pick up. I asked for the price of the wings and the person on the phone told me $.49. She then proceeded to take the order for my wings and a salad. She quoted me a time of 20 minutes so I arrived at 7:05 giving them an extra five minutes to complete my order. 

When I walked in nobody seem to know about my order, nor did they have it ready. The woman behind the bar then went to the register and put the order in telling me it was going to be another 10 minutes and walked away. 

I then looked at the check that she handed me and noticed that they had charged me double the price for the wings. I pointed this out to her and she said, \"No, we don't do 49 cent wings on takeout orders.\" I told her that I confirmed the price with the woman taking the order on the phone and that I expected them to honor the price. She refused so I asked for the manager. She said, \"I pretty much am the manager for right now. But the manager will be back in a few minutes, and the owner won't allow this anyway.\" I said, \"OK,\" handed her the check and walked out. 

The sad thing is this place has pretty good wings and a cool patio, but if you read the other low reviews, their BIGGEST issue is service, just like my experience. There are other wing places in Lakewood, so I'll be patronizing those instead of Around the Corner."}
{"text":"This place was really busy on Friday night. 

Met my bro here for a couple cocktails... The band played inside, while most of the crowd hung around the outside bar/patio area. Crowd was young (21-25). Drinks were cheap and everyone was friendly... good times :)

In walking distance of several other bars in case you get bored."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good place to go out, this is not it. The drinks were terrible and tasted cheap and very watered down. All 3 of my friends agreed. Staff was not friendly, especially the bar tenders, and they were not that busy. They acted like they didn't want to be bothered."}
{"text":"If you come here for the ambiance. Don't because it sucks. The food is good though. It is open to all ages which is cool? Who knows, this is a weird place."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience in a bar ever.  Went to go to the pop up Christmas bar which was attached but it was super crowded so went here to get a drink.  The bar tender was super rude , couldn't make a basic drink ( Manhattan) as they didn't have the ingredients .  Made a dirty martini instead and it was terrible.  Once again a basic drink and she totally f'd it up.  ( and I'm not a martini snob by any means). I'm going to try this during the week because it was a cute bar,just to  see if it was the trailer trash  bar tender that made it so unpleasant."}
{"text":"During the week I like to go here and order up some Buffalo wings or mini burgers. They have decent bar food. The wings are my default choice. They are cooked well done and are never mushy, rubbery and weird. My favorite hot wings in Cleveland. The music is hit or miss but mostly miss. The patio is a great oasis during a summer day or night, as long as it isn't busy. They charge  too much for domestic draft beer."}
{"text":"Bar service is great tonight. Lynn is very good. 
Cavs home opener. Inside was full so I sat outside. Loved the cool night with the heaters on, wings and beers rolling. Good night to watch CLE sports."}
{"text":"COCONUT PANCAKES!!!
I think they put cake batter in their pancakes, because they were amazing.  You get what you pay for as well.  Pancakes, home fries, bacon, AND sausage.  2 meals out of this breakfast meal."}
{"text":"I like the patio a lot and the fact they now keep it year round. Its hit or miss for the bar food, I normally don't go there specifically for food. I don't go to Lakewood bars period actually, so the crowd here really isn't my ideal one. They have a \"DJ\" and usually play horrible music. For me its like a high school reunion and ill always run into someone I don't really care to catch up on the last ten years with, or jumping around knocking into everyone. Don't get me wrong I'm very social, love meeting new people, normally don't like running into ones I haven't seen for a decade or so, its usually for a reason. I could sit home on FB that I don't have for all that. 

All I need is my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Don't go back for old time's sake. Food and service not the same.  Slow.   Slow.   Slow.   And the order was wrong.  Waitress felt bad and said one of my beers was on house but I noticed it was still on the bill. Saw the owner, Mickey, on way to my car and told him what happened. He said \"yeah, new menu.\" Funny because the menu had the same cartoon hamburgers it had in the mid 90s, and the same Lakewood bar food. He Offered a lame excuse, never apologized. This was our second unsuccesful attempt to happily revisit an old favorite - never going back. The same guy owns Georgetown Corners (former Three Birds spot) so expect the same great patio ruined by lousy food and lousy service there."}
