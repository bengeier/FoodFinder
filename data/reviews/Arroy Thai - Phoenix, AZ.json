{"text":"I ordered the spicy drunken noodles and it was really good! I finished the entire dish. It was nicely portioned, and I am definitely full after it. I've tried a lot of Thai restaurant in the past, and this restaurant definitely does justice. Do ask for peanut and spicy chili garlic sauce to spice up your food though. The people were very friendly, genuine, and accommodating! Also the whole restaurant is very clean.   Another plus is that this place has plenty of outlets. Pretty much along each dining table. They also provide wifi too!! Might be a good place to get some work done over food.   Overall I rate this place highly and would definitely bring my friends here for great Thai food."}
{"text":"Arroyo Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Ahwatukee! Accommodated our special order request with a smile. The Cashew Nut Dish was amazing. Must try! Hottest new restaurant in town.  Our waitress Dee was a dear."}
{"text":"Good place but we waited too long for food.  They seem to do a brisk take out business so even though we were the only people in the restaurant but the food took for ever to come to our table.  Once the food came it was good.  The only issue with the food was that I wanted more vegetables in my dishes."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff! Food was delicious and was very affordable! Would recommend over Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"Arroy Thai is amazing!  The food was fresh & delicious and the Owner and staff are fantastic!  My brother and I just went there for the 1st time tonight and can recommend the Pad Thai (all meats), Yellow Chicken Curry, and Chicken Satay (Not on the menu).  Shout out to our unexpected but great dinner companions, Adam & Grant!!"}
{"text":"Got the Mussaman Curry for takeout. It was just the right amount of spice (I ordered Med-spicy). It was the only curry dish I saw that had potatoes. I've been to Thailand dozens of times and it seemed like all the curry dishes there had potatoes, so I'm surprised more of their curry dishes didn't have potatoes. It could've used more chicken as well--not much there. Overall good Thai."}
{"text":"Amazing quaility with authentic taste, I'm so full right now but can not wait to eat here again!! Very friendly family feel inside. The soft shell crab is awesome!! Sweet rice with mango dessert too. You will be addicted."}
{"text":"Friendly quick service and the panang curry was amazing!  Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Arroy Thai offers the following:  Great Food Great Service And Respectable Prices  Which Makes It 5 Stars In My Books."}
{"text":"Love this place, they are very friendly. Food is delish. There is nothing in the menu that isn't good. I am so happy I found this place."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this little restaurant. Food was very good and fresh. Portion size was great for the price"}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food was good.  However today I went to grab a late lunch and was told I could get takeout only at 2:45. Lunch hours are until 3! Very bad and lazy business practices. Won't be back, there are plenty of other Thai in a 2 mile radius."}
{"text":"Really amazing flavorful Thai.  The chef when out of her way to make a gluten free fried rice dish. I asked for mild spice. I don't taste any spice but that is fine by me. This will be our new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai Curries and other authentic dishes just how I remember them when I was visiting Thailand! This place is the best I've been to since moving to Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Delicious! this place is located in Ahwatukee off of Ray Road and 48th St. unfortunately it's located in plaza that is pretty vacant so not many people know that the place is there. When I walked in, it was very quiet. There was only one lady with her kids eating. Not sure if it ever gets busy. The cashier lady the greeted me and took my order was very friendly. I ordered the chicken fried rice and it is delicious. If you're ooking for good Thai i highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but very bland for Thai food. I've had the Panang curry and pad Thai. Both were small portion sizes for the cost. I got the pad Thai to go and it smelled fishy when I opened it up, plus it was almost dry from not enough sauce (luckily I had extra pad Thai sauce in the fridge).   Service was good, but there are better Thai restaurants in the area that have better fotos for a similar price."}
{"text":"I have prayed for a good Thai restaurant to open in Ahwatukee and my prayers have been answered.  Arroyo Thai is amazing.  I was apprehensive when my wife said this new Thai restaurant was located in the strip mall by the old Sports Authority. I am blown away by the authenticity of the food. The Curry had a deep rich coconut flavor and the spice was perfectly balanced. My son had Pad Thai and my wife cashew chicken stir fry.  Both loved their meals. I will be back...."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant, the quality of food is very good. The food here is not greasy like most Thai restaurant and there is no compromise on the flavor"}
{"text":"After a long rough day, Thai food is what I needed. I ordered Chicken Padthai and it was amazing. I can tell that they use fresh ingredients and produce. The noodles are not soggy and awfully wet like other restaurants. If you want to judge Thai restaurant, order Padthai. If any restaurant mess up the main dish then it's probably a bad sign. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Had heard it was tasty months before we actually tried it. Went in for dinner on a whim. The place is cute, clean and service was very friendly. We were the only people sitting for dinner, a few to go orders ...ugh ! Started with lettuce cups that were delicious. My son got a new dish on the menu. Bacon and Friend fried rice... amazing! Veggies were fresh and crisp. I got a curry dish that was so flavorful. Loved every bite.  Will be back! Hopefully it will stay around!"}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I ordered shrimp pad Thai... was really good. Friendly service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Medium heat was a bit mild. Cellophane noodles are made from green beans, who knew?  Google did"}
{"text":"Food-9+. Great stuff. The ladies are super sweet. but The pace of service is dreadful. we waited over 20 minutes to get our bill. place 1/3 full. they need to step up their game service wise."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! We came for lunch. I had the chicken fried rice and my husband had the broccoli delight with chicken. Both medium spicy. I like spicy but next time I'll ask for a little less spicy. Portion sizes are generous. Atmosphere was nice. Service was good. Only suggestion would be to bring out all the food for the table at one time. It was only me and my husband, but I had my dish 2-3 min before his was brought out. We would go again. Food was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and found it very good. I really enjoyed it I highly recommend this to anyone. Try it the Salmon was great"}
{"text":"Great Thai food one of my favorites. Panang curry and cashew chicken are excellent. Just the right spice."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on Mother's Day, we were pleasantly surprised how clean and modern the decor was. The food was truly the best Thai food we have ever had.   We tried the Pad See-iew with chicken, the arroy fried rice, mussam curry with chicken, and last but not least the mango sticky rice.   A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We tried this for \"Lenner\" on Saturday afternoon and loved it! The service was great and very genuinely personal.  The restaurant was very clean and tidy.   We had 2 orderes of Pad Thai, one with Chicken medium spice, and one with Pork hot spice. They were both delicious, but trust me... The hot is HOT!!   We also ordered the Pad Se-ew with Beef medium spice... I think this might just be my new favorite!! Loved the flavor!   We will definitely visit this restaurant again. We felt the flavors were authentic and the atmosphere and service were great!"}
{"text":"What an outstanding lunch!  Delicious!  The lunch special is s great deal with the meal coming with soup and a spring roll.  Everything was tasty, the service was excellent, and the restaurant was very clean.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing Thai food! I have the same brand restaurant across the street from my house in Florida. I always get the combination fried rice or the pad Thai. I have to say that this place is slightly better! It's hard to find authentic places anymore and the owner uses her own family recipes! Definitely a place to try when you come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Had the sweet and sour chicken.  First they brought my husband's food which took longer since he ordered duck but forgot my meal.  Five minutes later my dish came which was very bland and the chicken was overcooked.  The staff was nice but I am not surprised that the place was empty.  Too bad because I really like Thai food."}
{"text":"A little grossed out sitting here, already ordered and look up to see waitress chomping down on corn on the Cobb. Grabs a napkin wipes her face and then walks into the back kitchen where I can see through the apron her preparing food. Never washing her hands.  Yuck yuck yuck."}
{"text":"This little place serves ones of the best Thai food in town. The owners are so sweet and friendly. The food is delicious. We always get carry out for dinner, never sat down to eat there. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here and ordered take out-  both are great! The staff is always very friendly. They have delicious pad Thai and drunken noodles! My husband likes a lot of spice and they definitely make it hot. I get no spice and it still tastes wonderful! Their delivery fee is a bit pricey so we always just do pick up. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After visiting Phoenix for the weekend, my partner and I decided to try a new Thai place, as our options tend to fairly limited in Tucson. As this was conveniently off the 10, we decided to try Arroy Thai. Interestingly, while the location was the primary factor for our choice, it was also the most frustrating thing about our experience- the restaurant is located in a very large shopping plaza, and is pretty tucked away, making it a little difficult to locate at first. Even so, we found it eventually, and I'm glad we did, because it was a great dining experience.  Even though we went for lunch, we decided to order off the dinner menu. We started with an order of larb gai, which was deliciously tangy and refreshing- a perfect summer dish. For our main entrees, we shared a chicken pad thai, an order of green curry with chicken, and also tried the Thai lemon chicken (something that I've never seen in a Thai restaurant before). You will notice that we love our chicken when it comes to Thai food.   The pad thai was great- perfect texture to the noodles while the sauce had a pronounced tamarind flavor. My partner felt it was a little too sweet for his liking, but I enjoyed it. The green curry was absolutely perfect. We ordered it medium spicy, but we could probably go up a notch next time. It was extraordinarily fresh-tasting. The Thai lemon chicken was sort of like Chinese-American sweet and sour chicken, with pineapple and bell peppers mixed with battered chicken. It could've been just a little tangier for my taste, but I still really liked it.  The best thing about this place was that it was very clean, lovely plating, and the lady running it was extremely nice and friendly. It was unfortunately empty when we went (Sunday at noon), but I hope that business picks up because this place is really great. I thought the pricing was quite fair- with all the food we ordered, we ended up paying around $50 after tax and tip- and it was great to support a local business. Just don't let the location fool you- this is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Great neighborhood Thai food place!  Chicken cashew nut with hot spice is the best!"}
{"text":"I eat too much Thai food. This place is one of the best. The drunken noodles are the bomb. Red curry as well. Very kind staff, easy online ordering"}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise for an Ahwatukee restaurant. Very fresh food and a nice clean restaurant. The ladies serving were very sweet. We had an excellent papaya salad, great entrees (both with brown sauce and veggies), and mango sticky rice for dessert...if it's in season get an order!"}
{"text":"Arroy Thai is delicious! The food is great and the service is wonderful! Go in to see Dee! She is such a delight and totally willing to help out with dining options!  When approaching, one might not think too much of it from the outside, but the inside is very nice! It's such a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We happened upon this hidden gem by accident and loved it.  The complimentary soup they served us was fabulous we could have just eaten a large bowl.  The lettuce wraps wer fresh, and entrees were too and very tasty.  Large portions for lunch, we took food home. Great place, clean and neat.  Service outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, clean, modern interior. We always get take out. Some of our favorite dishes are the pad Thai, spring rolls and amazing Rama. A couple of new Thai places in Ahwatukee in recent months and this ranks among the top. Thai hot isn't the spiciest we've had, but does a pretty good job of bringing the heat. Great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Three nights in a row and liked it then on the third night I decided to never go there again when I ordered the most expensive dish on the menu it was a fillet of grouper fish on the dish comes to me it was a deep-fried little tiny pieces of fish with giant fluffy greasy filling all around it something that I didn't want to eat being that I'm gluten-free there was no mentioning of deep fry or battering or anything and when I mentioned this she took the tax off the check for me I'm not going back after this I'll find an other new place"}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the service was amazing! If we are ever back in Phoenix, we will definitely be back.   The place is in a Strip Mall off set from the road with plenty of parking. It's really nice inside and clean. We were able to pick where we wanted to sit. I loved the attention to detail inside, especially the place settings and how they folded the napkins. If they cared that much about the small things, I had a feeling the experience was going to be great ... and it was!   We had Spring Rolls as an app and then I got Pad Thai for dinner. I originally asked for it as Medium spice level, but the waitress recommended Mild ... and I am so glad she did! Usually when I go to Thai restaurants the Mild version has no flavor. Not here! It was the perfect amount of spice and flavor, and I enjoyed every bite. The spring rolls were great, too.   The owner and waitress were very accommodating throughout the entire night. The food came out pretty quickly and they made sure our water glasses were always full. Pricing was pretty reasonable, too.   Overall, I would highly recommended this place if you are in the mood for Thai!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very fresh. The service was good. They cooked the shrimp in my pad Thai perfectly. My husband really enjoyed his arroy fried rice. This was our first time dining here, but if we have the opportunity we will return. Next time I would bump my spice level up from medium to high. I regularly eat jalapeños and other spicy foods. The medium spice barely registered on my spicy scale. You never know how the heat scale rates until you try a place :) Oh! and they have outlets at every table so you can charge your devices."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Arroy Thai food. Great food great service. Welcome to Awhatukee Arroy Thai food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service ..I like the pineapple froed rice , bangkok wings and drunken noodles. The food taste and service is consistent Everytime I came in"}
{"text":"I have had take out from this place and been there for lunch. Both times were two thumbs up. The pad Thai was absolutely delicious! It is very reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was superclean.The service was fabulous and they were so kind to our young daughter who was there with us. I would highly recommend Arroyo Thai as it is probably the best Thai food we have here in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"First time at Arroy Thai. Arrived at 6 PM on a Wednesday night and there were three other tables full. The restaurant was very clean and open. They could've added three tables for two if they chose.   I ordered Gyoza and Shrimp Pad Thai (spicy), plus a glass of ice water. They offer 4 heat levels. She saw that I was yelping so she gave me a free Thai Iced Tea. Good start.   They had two TVs but only one was on. It was playing esoteric type MTV. Kinda weird. Artfully set tables, with black and white napkins holding silverware, not plastic. Nice ambiance for a strip mall restaurant.   My app arrived in 6 mins. The 5 Gyoza were steamed and pan fried, just how I like them. The sauce was very rich with tamarind. The presentation was excellent and even had an orchid blossom. Very good app.   My Shrimp Pad Thai arrived about five minutes later.   It had 8 large Shrimp that were plump and juicy, tender egg noodles plus some wide egg noodles for presentation. Bean sprouts were found within, along with garnishes of crushed peanuts, scallions, egg and cilantro. The heat level was appropriate. It was a bit expensive but there was plenty of food for two peeps, so it was a good bargain.   The guy next to me tipped his bowl up to get the last drop, so that must've been tasty!  As I dined, 8 more groups came in, so it was steady.   Very good service tonight and I couldn't really find anything that went wrong!  I recommend Arroy Thai for a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed that I didn't find this precious little gem hidden near until it had been there for nearly a year. The restaurant experience we've had since coming to Phoenix nearly three years ago has been dismal as we have sampled one mediocre or terrible restaurant after another seemingly with no light at the end of the tunnel. Phoenix and the East Valley in general has been a foodie's nightmare, but Arroy Thai gave me a ray of hope. The restaurant is in a small, clean, simple storefront location across 48th Street from Target. For starters, I thought to play it safe and order the pad thai, which my wife ended up ordering. Instead, I  decided to be a little more daring and try the grouper pad char. We started out with the standard Thai spring rolls and Bangkok wings for appetizers and were pleasantly surprised. They were fresh and the sauces were tasty, but they couldn't prepare me for my delicious adventure with the grouper plate. The pieces of fish were hidden in a flavorful forest of basil leaves and veggies and covered with a light batter that surprised my taste buds with its simple but exquisite plunge into the ocean waters of the fish's origin.  In addition to our tasteful meal, the owner/chef came out from the kitchen and showed a real interest in whether or not we were enjoying our meal, chatting us up for a short time before leaving us to finish our meal. The server also spent time pointing out various things about the sauces and meal that were very helpful.   The menu was very explicit, explaining the ingredients of each meal for anyone not entirely familiar with Thai cuisine. Although it was our first time at this restaurant, there was no fumbling about with a new, badly designed menu trying to figure out what was what. We are so happy to have found this place, better late than never, and fully intend to return and try some of the other selections on the extensive menu, and, of course, we would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in Phoenix who has a clue about what real Thai food should taste like. I can only hope that represents a large enough group of people to keep this valuable asset in business."}
{"text":"Not a Thai expert, but I really enjoyed the food. Friendly service and was told they have good deal on Tuesdays with Pad Thai. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place. Good portions and tasty food. So far the better Thailand food I've had around the area and I'm thai."}
{"text":"An amazing new Thai restaurant! The first thing you will notice is the outstanding hospitality and friendliness of the staff. Second thing you notice is the outstanding quality and presentation of the food. This is the place worth checking out and making a favorite to return to again and again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the vegetable green curry and I ordered chicken red curry. The dishes were spicy but very flavorful! The crab Rangoons were amazing! And our waitress was so helpful and friendly! If i lived in Phoenix I would come here all the time."}
{"text":"***DON'T BOTHER***  Sign out front, time on Google, and time on Yelp all said opens at 11am. Showed up at 11:30 and it was closed.  Poor management. Don't bother wasting your time...they might be closed by the time you get there."}
{"text":"Omg chick pad Thai!!! So delicious! I had been craving pad Thai for a while and I've loved walking distance from it for a year and finally went! I've been missing out!!! Also had the spring rolls! Yummm. Really good food. It's my new Thai place :)"}
{"text":"Do not just drive by! You will be missing some of the freshest, most delicious Thai food in the Phoenix area. Service is attentive, decor modern with hints of the culture to let you know the type of food you will be served. Love the fresh rolls, and the spicy drunken noodles, add shrimp, are to die for! They like spice so be sure you are prepared for hot if you even order medium. Again, they are very accommodating without sacrificing authenticity, so let them know how you like it. While being accessible, their location is tucked in the corner. I wish it had a better visibility because I think more people would stop by."}
{"text":"Very good Thai place! The curry was very rich in flavor and their Tom Kha is my favorite. The service was overall very quick and friendly. The place is small so it may be hard to get seated if they are busy, but it's definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"The lunch options here are fantastic and cheap. Experience has been great everytime I've come and will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are vegan and Thai is a solid go to for us.  We were very pleased with our meal and look forward to going back and trying different dishes.  The staff was extremely pleasant and the restaurant was very clean.  We would recommend this to anyone who likes fresh and tasty Thai!!"}
{"text":"First time there, ordered food to go on a Friday evening by phone. It took a couple of times of trying for the phone call to be answered, so I knew they were busy. The wait is a little long on the weekend, fyi...40 min. When I got there every table was full, good sign. We ordered the gyoza, the pad thai shrimp, the pad see ew with chicken, and the house fried rice with chicken. They were all good. The only two small things were the gyoza were no longer as hot as the other dishes, and my husband said medium on the pad thai wasn't hot enough. But the quality of the food was good, plus for next time they said they deliver within 5 miles for orders over $35, with a $4 delivery fee. I have a toddler and gave him the rice, pad see ew, and gyoza and he liked all of them."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was stymied with the menu. I couldn't order my usual eggplant with chicken only shrimp and tofu. Secondly they don't serve my other usual Ginger chicken for lunch only dinner.  I ordered the only other item I thought I might enjoy... I didn't enjoy this version of sweet  & sour though. Cooked cucumbers and tomatoes didn't appeal to my taste buds.   Every other Thai restaurant allows you to order whatever meat you wish with the eggplant so I don't understand this limitation.   Not to mention I had to endure a version of American Idol in a foreign language blaring on the tv the entire meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. The waitress Dee was super helpful and explained all the dishes and gave her recommendations. Ordered the red curry with chicken. Very clean, new restaurant. Highly recommend and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My wife & I love the spicy basil & green curry. My son loves the fresh rolls. Very good Thai restaurant & good prices."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food. I ordered the pad see ew, basil beef and black pepper beef, Gyoza and shrimp for apps. Everything was awesome and our waitress Dee was super attentive and honest with her opinions on The extensive menu. Their portion sizes were perfect (for me at least) and I'll definitely say it was worth the trip to come out here. Environment is clean too!"}
{"text":"Smaller Servings, OK Food, Higher Prices   After trying to eat at this restaurant three times we finally got there when they were open and ordered some food. The serving sizes were kind of small leaving me still hungry when I left. The prices were a little bit high considering the serving sizes were so small especially.  We didn't really receive much service at all, no one really said much to us and when our water ran out that was the end of the water for the day.  All in all it was not a terrible place and if you needed to eat somewhere it would be perfectly acceptable. However I probably wouldn't rush back to a place that didn't perform as well as many of my favorites in the area."}
{"text":"I had tofu with house fried rice. Very good! The place looked perfectly clean and very chill inside. I'm vegetarian and this tofu is my favorite of all the Thai places in the area. I've eaten here 4 times now, every time has been great!"}
{"text":"Arroy was good. Pretty good. My boyfriend and I got the Pad Thai and it was pretty tasty but my main issue with our meal was that we both ordered Medium and I could SWEAR it was at least hot. I can't tell you enough, their Medium for us was making us sweat. We were sucking down water like nothing else and it just was a little frustrating because I just can't imagine how a Medium slice could be that insanely spicy. From my understanding, we chose 2 out of 5. If I'm missing something here, someone help a sista out! The service was just ok and my boyfriend asked for water and we were one of two tables in the restaurant and she turned said \"okay\" to him on the water and never came back and we had another server the remainder of the time. Weird! If I went again, I'd pick-up the food and choose Mild without a doubt! You've been warned ;)"}
{"text":"Love this new Thai restaurant! I just had the soft shell green curry dish and was truly blown away by the flavors.  The serving size was perfect for two (if you want to share.)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  We invited friends out that never had Thai food and they loved it.  We had the Beef Teriyaki, Thai Pepper Steak, Pan Khing, and Beef Curry and everything was a hit!  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It would be easy to pass by this inconspicuous little Thai place tucked away in one of Phoenix's endless series of strip malls. But don't. The curry is delicious and the crab Rangoon is mouth-watering."}
{"text":"I ate here several times but didnt get a chance to write a review. Well I visit here tonight after a long day, and I want to share my experience. Roti appetizer was superb (not a normally find in a Thai restaurant). You must have and you won't be sorry. It was definitely tasty/yummy/turn your head. It's a dish from southern Thailand (the chef told me). I ordered the Tom Yum Goong (shrimp). It's some kind of a spicy but clear soup. It helped clear my sinus as well as make me sweat a little. Then finally for the main, I had the Four Buddies - strange name -  it was a new item on the  menu. I dropped my pant after the first bite. How did pork, beef, chicken and shrimps become friends, who know ? or who care?  It was so delicious....and filling. I have to come back for more...  PS: Come to eat at Arroy Thai by myself is my only mistake - Because I can't try all other dishes or else someone need to carry me out!"}
{"text":"Food is great.. portions are good.. i just wish the chicken coconut soup would have more ingredients other than just chicken and mushrooms...the shrimp pad Thai was great!!!"}
{"text":"We just ate here last night after a couple of our usual spots were closed for the holiday. Our party of 6 arrived and sat down as there is only a few tables available, inside is nice and clean looking. We sat for an awkward amount of time until we all started just staring at the two people in the front wondering if we would ever have any service. Finally someone came over and asked if we needed drinks, when they came back they missed one drink. Then once we ordered, they dropped the ticket and didn't even notice for a couple minutes until one of us brought it over thankfully. Who knows how long we would have sat wondering where our food was! When the food came it was nice sized portions, we had two orders of the spicy drunken noodles, one pad thai, one cashew nut, and one chicken fried rice. The two with the spicy drunken noodles didn't like the texture of the thick noodles at all, and one had ordered extra spicy but said it had no heat  so they were not happy. The cashew nut was delicious, no complaints there. The pad thai was just ok, said they've had better for a better price and the chicken fried rice was very good according to our 1 and 6 yr olds. All in all I don't think I would think to go back to this place again unless everywhere else is closed again."}
{"text":"My husband does not normally \"dig on\" tofu but he really enjoyed the spicy basil sauce lunch dish. I thoroughly enjoyed my green curry dish. The meal was preceded with a small salad and one small egg roll. My egg roll was room temperature while my hubs was warm. Taste was good however. Our bill averaged $10 for lunch per person with water to drink. It was worth every penny! This location is new to the area so the place is clean and decorated well. It is small if you dine in. Five booths that seat two persons comfortably. Six smaller tables that can be pushed together for larger groups. Fast and friendly service. I highly recommend this for great curry!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. I was impressed by this small, and quiet restaurant tucked away in this shopping plaza. I've eaten here numerous times already and have called in a few orders to go, it's always consistent and they're usually pretty quick."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very underrated. We came here because of its proximity to the movie theater, but will definitely be back! Service was SO friendly and the food was exceptional. Everything has the perfect amount of spice and great flavor. We had spicy basil, fresh ginger, and soup."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Wings are delicious.  Everyone enjoys the different  dishes we tried.  Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food. Wonderful service. Food is made to order just the way you like it. And now, they serve a terrific Pho soup with a savory, well seasoned broth that makes Arroyo Thai the default choice for our family when we are wondering where to eat out.  A terrific value.  Large food portions mean plenty of leftovers, too."}
{"text":"Excellent even better than the award winning Thai restaurant in Los Angeles that I tried before . I really recomend this place.  Very nice employees and spectacular job on service not to long of wait and a very friendly restaurant and while your there try the mango sticky rice...it is  spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Large portion for the price. The service was spot on I don't recall her name but she was super friendly and funny. She made you feel like you were at a family dinner only because she had everyone who was eating talking to her and each other. I loved it."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Friendly staff and very clean. I order my food Medium and it's the perfect amount of heat. I recommend the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Thai food around.  I come here every week and will continue to come back.  The service is always top notch, I highly recommend Arroy to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful.  The service was very friendly.  My boyfriend ordered Thai hot Drunken Noodles and he got it and loved it.  I had the papaya salad-- excellent!  We will definitely back.  Clean, nicely decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"Their Thai chili is the best! It's super fresh and imported straight from Thai. Food was amazing, our server Joy was excellent, and on Tuesdays there's a buy one get one half off Pad Thai special. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, and a very kind host! The spicy Drunken Noodle was delicious, and we really enjoyed the Pad Se-eu! Will definitely be back soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai fare in Ahwatukee!  Recommended!  I love Thai food, and wanted to try this place ever since seeing the first Yelp reviews. So a couple friends and I decided to have a Sunday lunch to check it out. TL;DR: we all really liked it!   Arroy Thai is tucked into a strip mall, so plenty of parking is available. They open at 11 AM on Sunday, and we arrived about noon. There was only one other customer, which was a surprise, but several other tables filled up while we were there.   Food: The lunch menu has pretty standard Thai dishes, but some items are only available on the dinner menu (served after 4 PM). I ordered the Panang Curry with pork (spicy), and my friends ordered the Cashew Nut with chicken (mild) and the Pad Se-ew with tofu (medium). I tasted each dish, and my friends and I agree: they were all really good! The ingredients all seemed fresh and properly cooked. The vegies were still a bit cruchy, and everything had a nice texture. My Panang Curry was especially flavorful, and not too sweet. One thing I noticed, the \"medium\" and \"spicy\" were not nearly as spicy as I expected. I like my Thai food to have a really good kick, so next time Ill try \"Thai hot\". As others have said, the portions are a little on the small side, but for lunch that was just fine with us. Honestly, I wouldn't hesitate to order any of these same dishes next time, although with such variety I might well try something different!   I notice the online lunch menu says \"Every Entree served with complimentary salad and fried wonton\", and in another place \"Every Entree served with complimentary soup of the day and fried wonton\", but none of us received salad, soup, or wonton.  Cost: For both lunch and dinner, the entrees are priced according to the type of protein you order. For example, all lunch entrees with chicken are $7.95, and with shrimp are $9.95. My Panang Curry with pork was $8.95 plus tax, which was reasonable.  Service:   The staff were friendly and  attentive, and we never felt rushed.  Atmosphere: This place is open and colorful, and has a relaxing feel. Decorations are sparse, not at all cluttered. And when we were there it was impeccably clean!  Overall: I enjoyed the meal, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a nice time here.  The waitress was very nice and the food was excellent.   We had the Pad Thai, Red Curry and Fried Rice.   We'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and her friend told me about this place so I figured I'd give it a try. I came for lunch and I have to say I was not disappointed. The food and service was awesome! I couldn't tell you how I many times I've driven past the place, but I'm glad I stopped in today. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best pad Thais I've had in Arizona! Their Tom Yum soup and curry are both really good too. Also, the mango sticky rice is phenomenal! Definitely would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here.  The spicy drunken noodles were great.  The portions were a bit small for the price but the quality of the food was excellent.  I'm looking forward to trying more options.  They have a Pad Thai Tuesday special where it's buy one get one 50% off which I'll be sure to try out.  Also, I was told by the waitress it's BYOB so that's good to know."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, but lately the food has been extremely dry with little flavor. No longer a place I enjoy going to"}
{"text":"One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had. My wife had the red curry and he said it was fresh and excellent. The service was excellent as well and very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. Loved it! Probably the best Crab Rangoons I've ever had! Fantastic Pad Thai & Tom Kah. Clean. Easy to order online for pick up. Excellent service. Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"We ended the weekend with a great dinner and had the Arroy Soft Shell Crab  w/ shrimp  and some yummy Pad Woodesen w/ some more shrimp. It's the first time I've actually had soft shell crab and it was delicious and my personal fav is always some noodles, veggies and . We support local. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to give it a try.  WOW, service was very friendly, quick and very personable.  I had the drunken noodles and my wife had the massona curry.  Both dishes were very hot and fresh tasting.  All around the restaurant was very good, great to have a Thai place so close to home, we will be back for more.  Also they run a Chicken Pad Thai special on Tuesdays, buy 1 get 50% off the 2nd."}
{"text":"I have searched the Phoenix valley far and wide for good Thai and sad to say this isn't it. We ordered 6 different things for our family with 3 different types of meat. The shrimp was way over cooked and rubbery. The beef was tough and lacked flavor.  The different dishes had one thing in common...too much pepper. As in a black pepper taste that overwhelmed the dish.  It was sort of strange for Thai food to have this persisting pepper flavor in such a variety of dishes.  The other disappointing thing was when we ordered the food for takeout we were told it would be 40 min before our food was ready. It was only 5:00 and I felt that was a long wait for a takeout order.  Keep searching...there is good Thai food in the valley.   Not sure if I'm allowed to mention it here but you can see my other reviews for details."}
{"text":"Crab rangoons were tasty. The red curry has a decent flavor. I ordered it thai hot and it wasn't spicy at all - I actually had to add my own spices.   When you order curry to-go, they don't put it in a soup container. Instead, they wrap it in tin foil and put it in a styrofoam tray. It leaked all over inside the bag.  It's strange, because my boyfriend's tom yum soup WAS in a soup container - so they definitely have them. He said the tom yum was okay, but nothing special.  I would have given them 3/5, except for the worst offense - there was a ROCK in the lettuce wraps.  Awful."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and they have always been grrreat! If you don't want it too spicy, be sure to order Mild, otherwise be prepared for some heat!  The yellow curry and hot & sour soup is soooo good! Be sure to give them a try next time you're looking for some good Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai food is my absolute favorite. I wish I could eat it every day! I usually judge a Thai restaurant on their panang curry and Tom ka soup. Theirs is on point. I am so glad to have another great spot to choose from in Ahwatukee. I will be a regular.  On a side note, some of you may not be aware that this small business was burglarized in the middle of the night a few days ago. Thieves came in through the roof and stole all money and valuables. It's not easy to get a small business up and running to start with, but this is a major set back for them. I would just like to encourage the community to come together and support them. Grab lunch or dinner there when you can and help them to re-establish. Show your love Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"The Panang curry with chicken at Arroy Thai is delicious! Crab Rangoon too. We've been waiting for great Thai food in Tukee and this place is awesome.  We can't wait to try all the other dishes. I also love that we can order online for take out. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from start to finish. We ordered the pad Thai, pad see ew, fresh rolls, and the lunch specials came with soup and fried egg rolls. I can't express how perfectly cooked everything was and those flavors were incredible. The service was pretty good and I will be returning. Check it out! Lunch specials on the weekend are a pretty nice touch as well :)"}
{"text":"I had their Pad Se-Ew with beef. It was great and had lots of flavor. There was a lot of food, lots of veggies, lots of beef. Overall, a great experience.   This place also has free WiFi."}
{"text":"The seafood PadThai is the most perfect PadThai ever!  The staff are super friendly!  It's a super quiet neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute new spot in the Ahwatukee Foothills. Friendly...and a good full menu. Got a free Thai Ice and 10% off my bill! I can see this being a regular place to pick up a quick thai meal."}
{"text":"The cleanliness and up to date design and style were great to start with.  The shrimp pad Thai was outstanding. Fresh ice tea was indicative of the fresh approach they have to all there dishes."}
{"text":"My sister in law is Thai and we have enjoyed many home cooked dinners. We were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful food at this small gem tucked into a strip mall. We had the chicken lard salad , pumpkin curry with chicken and eggplant lovers with tofu.  Servings were generous and packed with vegetables.The food was delicious and heathy. Seats were almost full on a Monday night so people must come here regularly. Service was friendly and fast.  Our meal with 2 beers was less than $50.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the duck and fish dishes."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and it was close to our apartment so we thought to check it out...this place is small but nice... very friendly, the lady didn't charge us for the coke and Thai tea bc she said we were the first customers and we told her that we found this place on Yelp.. we ordered the Thai egg rolls, Thai sweet and sour chicken. And chick. Pad Thai.. the egg rolls were just average but everything else was good and the prices are decent.. they have outlets by every table so if you need to charge ur phone while you eat you can... and they also have buy 1 pad Thai get the 2nd 50% off on tuesdays ..."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and were craving some really good Thai food. We found this little gem while doing errands in the area and thought we'd give it a try. Boy, are we glad we did! Everything was better than we expected. Just for starters we both have tried many thai restaurants and have appreciated the differences from place to place but my gf has been to Thailand and remembers how the food tasted there. She says this place brought back such great memories. The owner was chatting a bit with us since it was the slow time on a weekday afternoon after the lunch rush. She was so nice, personable and gave us many ideas for what to order when we go back again, which we will! We ordered the Red Curry w/shrimp and the Panang Curry w/shrimp and shared. I have to say both were kind of similar but you could definitely taste that one had more of a lemongrass flavor to it, both absolutely delicious. For dessert we had the Mango sticky rice which I'd never tried before because I'm not crazy about mango. The owner suggested it so we gave it a try and it's my new favorite Thai dessert! It was perfection, the mango was sweet, succulent and beautifully presented on the plate, the sticky rice is served warm with a coconut cream, it was just perfect. I can't wait to go back and try the green curry, they made it sound so good I had a hard time deciding what to order initially. Definitely recommend Arroy to anyone in search of good Thai cooking, it is obviously made with a lot of love."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite the night before flying back home. The Thai place I normally go to is tasty but a tad on the greasy side, but this place was fresh, light on the grease, and absolutely delicious! I ordered the Pad Woonsen, and it was on point! Will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Visited this Thai restaurant for the first time last month and loved it. My family and I love Thai food and this is some of the best we've had in the valley. They are also very kid friendly and not only did a special rice order for my 3 year old, but they made sure he and the rest of us felt comfortable. I was blown away by the quality, prices and friendliness of this great little restaurant. I highly recommend you try them out. You won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Still clean and fresh!  Just disappointed that with the lunch dish there were only 4 small pieces of meat."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've ever had. Even my two year old who's really too picky ate the whole plate. Donno why this place doesn't get enough hype"}
{"text":"Talk about scoring a great deal, free Thai ice tea with a Yelp check in and a 10% off for their grand opening!! I ordered a to go lunch over the phone and the food was ready in 15 minutes. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. When I picked up the order the staff took time to explain what was in each container and separated the wontons to avoid then beginning soggy. The restaurant is small and cute, it was quiet.  The environment was welcoming as well, I will definitely dine in one of these days. The food was delicious and affordable. Lunch specials start at $7.95 and the portions are very reasonable. I am a tough Thai food  critic being I am very familiar with the Thai culture and food, their food definitely has the Thai flavors and Thai kick. I will definitely be back and  become a regular. Excited to have a good Thai place in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this clean, neat little eatery since they opened. We always come for lunch and find it tasty and sufficient. I thought the menu was a bit limited but they have many specials too. I've tried several of their lunch entrees and found them uniformly delicious. Their curries are rich, thick and yummy. We will be regulars as long as this place continues. Its nice to have this type of eatery on Ray amid the usual strip mall shops. I just hope more people learn of it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very inviting, wall decorations are impressive.  I went with my husband and son and they enjoyed fried  mixed vegetable,  spicy beef salad ( I think that 's what it is called) and creamy soup (it 's taste more like a mushroom soup than a Thai soup but I like it).    The salad was too spicy for my two boys but they love it with lot of rice :).  We waited for food quite a bit but the gentle speed :) 's the same on all Thais restaurant we visited."}
{"text":"Came into Arroy Thai to grab a quick bite of Pangnag curry and some coconut soup. Everything was delicious, they had coconut milk thai iced tea - my favorite! Great service! The best part was the perfect playlist of House music playing in the background! Glad I stopped in!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner. It's a small place with a friendly staff and good food. I ordered the Pad See Ew and was not disappointed. My dish was fresh and was prepared quickly. The sauce was rich, smokey and very flavorful, if not quite spicy enough for me. The portions are good too. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"First time at the Arroy Thai and I love Thai food so I am happy to have one right next door to me.  - Food and appetizers was delicious - It is super clean - The Arroy Thai team member is super friendly - Bathroom resort like and super clean - Menu items reasonably price - Decor is very zen and chic - Great place for a romantic date - Great place for just hanging out with friends"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed when I arrived here because I thought they had lunch entrees on Saturdays and they do not. Regardless, the husband and I stayed and ate some seriously tasty Thai food. We ordered spring rolls, potstickers, and drunken noodles with beef ( at five star spicy level). The spring rolls and potstickers were nothing to write home about, but their noodles were excellent! They really made them spicy, which I appreciated, and the spiciness didn't take away from the flavor of the dish. The portions were quite large. The prices were a little on the expensive side, but not terrible. I would recommend Arroy!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. Everything's I've tried has been great but I'm OBSESSED with the Green Curry. It is amazingly delicious.  Dishes are actually hot here so I might recommend starting at a mild or medium spice before diving into hot. Great place to dine in but also works very well as take out!"}
{"text":"Great service on a to-go order and to-go orders after us. The cashier was very intuitive and offered us spice on the side when we weren't sure what level to choose.   Very nice modern interior design and very clean."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers on a Monday. I got to the parking lot at 10:45 and started getting nervous because there were no cars in front of the restaurant, but the owners quickly came before 11 and opened just in time for us to go in. They were super nice as soon as we walked in. We got their lunch special which comes with an eggroll and everything was really good. I got the red curry lunch with medium spice and it was really good, flavorful, the spice level was perfect, the portion size was perfect. The eggroll was really good and fresh and super hot. Our service was quick, the ladies there were super nice and accommodating, and we'll definitely be back to try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"this place has really good thai food! I always get the Pad Thai which is always delightful and consistent when I come over! the only thing that i would say about this place is there service lacks! the servers hardly can understand english and I got brought my check right after I received my food... which was annoying!"}
{"text":"Very clean and charming inside. Staff is super friendly. Thai iced tea was great, not too sweet! Lots to choose from on the menu. Food was delicious. Outlets at every table which is nice. We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food joints ive found! Had their spicy Pan-Am and had a nice kick to it. Really hit the spot. Coming back for sure!"}
