{"text":"It's 3.5.     We had:  #10: Kalbitang ($8.99):  Typical price for kalbitang at other korean restaurants is usually $11-$13.  It's $9 here.  Very good super tender beef short ribs (4 pieces).  Good strong beef broth.  Rice is a bit hard.  Rating 4/5  #14: Soondubu soup with seafood($7.99):  Good soft tofu but lacked seafood.  Good broth.  Rating: 3.5/5  They gave us 6 banchan(small dishes in the beginning).  They were quite mediocre.    Good service.  Aside from the banchan the mains were well done.  Would come back again.  CASH or DEBIT only.  No credit cards."}
{"text":"Great new authentic Korean restaurant! Our usual go-to is Nak Won but we decided to try this place one night. Service was great, and the food came out quickly. I had the Kim chi stew which had great flavour, spiciness was perfect (the good kind of spicy where your nose is constantly running just a bit!) and was better than other places I've tried! We also had the lah boki (duk boki with ramen) which was also delicious (just wish there were more noodles!).   Inside the restaurant is nice and clean, and doesn't have that heavy Korean-food-air lingering like other Korean restaurants, so you don't leave with your clothes reeking of the place.   Overall a nice addition to the area and I think our go-to Korean restaurant has now changed to Mom's kitchen!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this restaurant a proper review of their food. I cannot believe that some of the other reviewers went into what music was playing and that chicken tasted like chicken...how am I supposed to base my decision to eat here on stupid reviews like that?  First, I am Korean so I know what Korean food is supposed to taste like and the food here is good. It's not the best in the world but overall, it's tasty and satisfying.   The pork bone soup is seasoned well and tastes balanced with a slow simmered broth. The ginger doesn't overpower the pork. The heat is right, although I think they may have made it milder for non-Korean palates. It's not the best pork bone soup but it is very decent.   The beef soup is bland and tastes more like a clear broth gom-tang so I don't recommend it unless you like plain tasting soup bases. They give very generous portions for the price and the takeout containers are very good quality.   The kimchi fried rice is very savory and I like how they cut the kimchi into tiny pieces so that the taste is dispersed well throughout the dish, I do wish they put more pork meat pieces.   The black bean noodle is what you would expect and made with pan fried black bean sauce (gan) rather than regular black bean sauce--usually it costs more but it looks as if the cost is the same as regular black bean sauce. They also give a very generous container of kimchi. I do think the kimchi may be store bought however it is tasty. See my photos for reference. This is a decent restaurant and deserves four stars. If they improved on the kimchi and gave just a bit more pork in the kimchi fried rice then it would be a four and a half to five star rating."}
{"text":"Eager to find a new Korean restaurant in the area, I decided to check it out with my mom for dinner. The sign outside lead me to think that this restaurant would taste like authentic Korean food since the name of the restaurant proclaimed that it is like mom's cooking. I had gotten the Seafood Soondubu and my mom had gotten the Gamjatang. They had brought out the banchan at the beginning as they do and immediately I noticed how off things were.   While the portions were great, the Seafood Soondubu I had was filled to the brim with tofu to make up for the lack of seafood. I found the food bland and it didn't seemed to have as much spice that I'm accustomed to for Korean food. Trying a bit of the Gamjatang, I noticed once again how lacklustre the food was.    As for atmosphere, it was comfortable but they had a tv playing music videos from this Youtuber the entire time which seemed sort of strange. When it came to service, the waitress was quick and fairly attentive. Overall, it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Honestly I was really impressed with this little korean restaurant. We got in and the server greeted us quickly and nicely. She gave us option for seating. We received our little sides quickly after we ordered. The spicy pork bibimbap was really good and my bf thought they were really generous with the veggies and pork portion. We also ordered the pork bone soup, sweet potato fries and chicken wings. Definitely one of our fav. Pork bone soup, it was flavorful and didn't taste watered down or too gingery. Sweet potatoes fries came with spicy mayo and when we asked for more mayo the server didn't give a stink face or charged us a ransom number off of her head. She was really kind and brought us some more. The chicken wings were ok, you can definitely skip them. Overall, the service was extremely awesome, the food is tasry and well proportioned. I think we found our Korean spot in Markham."}
{"text":"Certainly not the greatest Korean restaurant, but not bad if you're craving Korean. My group tried the bibimbap, pork bone soup, and the seafood udon. The Bibimbap was average, the pork bone soup was tasty, and the seafood udon was apparently good (I did not have any but everyone else liked it).   The side dishes were very average though, certainly a lot better to be had elsewhere. But again, if you're really craving Korean food, Mom's Kitchen will do just fine.   The service was excellent, our waitress spoke English and Cantonese very well. She was quick and attentive to what we needed."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Update: Been visiting this place quite often and the pork bone soup has been better than the first time around. The texture of the rice is also better. It definitely does the job and it is a quick cheap meal. Note that I only get this menu item each time I go so I cannot comment on the other dishes. ==  Decided to give this Korean joint a try as I was craving for pork bone soup and a friend mentioned that the place was decent.  Service was friendly and attentive. Waitress took the time to explain the menu to other folks and provided suggestions which you do not see often for a fast paced restaurant.  The pork bone soup was not bad. I asked for extra spicy as I have been told that their regular spicy is not too spicy. There was a fair amount of meat and it was tender for the most part. In terms of the soup base, the spice level hit the spot nicely but the pork broth and garlic flavour could definitely be more amped up.  The rice that came with the pork bone soup was a bit of a downer. They used a very small short grain rice which did not seem to match well with the soup. Would be nice to get something with a bit more chew to go along with the soup.  I would come back another time to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"New Korean in the area means it's a must try! In an area that has very limited parking and the restaurant being a little on the smaller side, it was a nice alternative to some other Korean restaurants in the area.  One of the biggest differences in this restaurant was that they offered Jjajangmyeon. There are no other places that I know of that offer it in the area, so that is definitely a plus. It was also quite delicious, so definitely worth ordering. I came with a group of 5 people as well, so we order the Boodae Jjigae, which was AMAZING. Lots of veggies, meats, and even rice cakes! All the food was amazing and fair priced for their portion sizes!  Service was really good as well, lots of attention, quick service and the owner even came out to talk to us a bit too. They even explained things about how to eat and differences in spiciness too.  Definitely recommend this location for some different kinds of dishes in the Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, it is totally unauthentic Korean food.  Ordered seafood pancake, black bean noodles and rice.  Seafood pancake had very little seafood, just a few small shrimps and tiny scallops.  Taste ok but I can even do better at home.  Black bean noodles was ok and rice was ok.  Nothing make you want to return again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time now and just want to give a shout out to the waitress for always being approachable and attentive. Definitely one of the main reasons that contributes to the decision of dining here often. This place has decent korean food and not a bad place to drop by when you want to satisfy some cravings. If you are looking for really good authentic korean food, what are you doing looking for it in Markham anyways."}
{"text":"If our server wasn't nice, I would probably give this place a one star. The side dishes were bland and the potatoes were hard and crunchy. I ordered a bibimbap and I was expecting the meat to be bulgogi, but it was just plain ground beef. My bf ordered spicy pork on rice and the vegetables were all hard and undercooked. Disappointed :("}
{"text":"Mom's Kitchen has quickly become one of my favourite places to eat.   The service is really friendly and the server that usually works there recognizes my husband and I every time we go. She also has our order memorized.   The food always comes quickly. My favourite thing to get here is their kimchi stew. It is full of meat, veggies, and kimchi. My husband always gets their pork bone soup and says its one of his favourites to date. Their kimchi fried rice is also really good if we want something different from our usual order.   They are always happy to refill your side dishes without you having to ask, which I can appreciate. Cause I'm always eating them while I wait for my piping hot food to cool.   We are always happy to come here whenever we don't feel like cooking at home."}
{"text":"found this korean restaurant when i was grocery shopping. was pleasantly surprised. the restaurant was clean and simple and the servers were nice. i ordered a katsu chicken and i have to say they did a great job at it. it waa crispy on the outside but the meat was still juicy and tender on the inside. the dipping sauce they had made for it which i believed was some sort of of katsu mayo combo was also very good. its taste was tangy but uplifting. the pork bone soup our family had ordered was very nice. the spices were all correct and i think overall most of it was pretty good. the only thing was the korean aide dishes offered were not very good and the kimchi wasnt  quite the right flavour for it. otherwise i would recommend those with a craving for korean to come here. as the prices are reasonable and the food is goos"}
{"text":"Mom's Kitchen is located in the Langham plaza south of Highway 7 and on Kennedy. Parking spots near this restaurant are limited due to the many restaurants and chiropractic practice next door, but there is an underground parking you can go to.  The double doors definitely prevent the cold from seeping into the restaurant (not super large place). The prices are rather inexpensive for a Korean place - about $7.99 for a meal. Their banchan consisted of seaweed salad, potatoes (this was actually hot and not sweet, but tasted like soup potatoes), kimchi, bean sprouts and radish slices. The waitress was very nice and speaks Cantonese as well as English.  We decided to try their seafood pancake and their pork bone soup. Both items were mediocre, though I'd like to say that their seafood pancake consisted of quite a few items including shrimp, chives, scallop and the base was made from egg and sweet potato flour. The pork bone soup in my opinion could be a little spicier and could have been cooked with more flavour in it. All together, it was $10 a person! Great for dinner on a weekday night!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The service was very friendly and quick. The waitresses were speed walking and trying to get everybody served, but were polite about it!   I ordered the seafood pancake, and my boyfriend ordered octopus on sizzling skillet with rice.    We also got 6 complementary side dishes.  They were all pretty good and went well with the meal, we ordered seconds!   The seafood pancake was a little disappointing.  It was soggy, not crispy like I expect, and not many toppings like onions or octopus.  The vinegarette sauce that it came with was quite salty.   My boyfriends sizzling dish was very salty.  At first when having the first bite it's not too bad, but with all the sauce and having a 3rd or 4th bite, it started numbing my tongue.   I would give the food 2.5, but with the nice service it bumped it up to 3."}
{"text":"I walked in and it was way too hot. I don't think they have great air ventilation because you can still smell what the others ordered and the air was very still.   I ordered the chicken bibimbap. I don't usually like vegetables, so I didn't have high expectations.   The chicken was actually really awesome. It was grilled well and still hot even when I got to the end of the meal. It actually tasted like chicken.   All the vegetables tasted okay separately, but when I mix them and put them on my spoon, the different tastes all seemed to blend together so I couldn't recognize them. Weird. I guess the veg tasted a little bland. The mushrooms were great though!   Only the chicken was a positive food experience.   I like that they were playing Americans got talent and those things on their tv. The whole restaurant was rapt. Even my friends and I were watching it with full attention.   Would I come here again? Probably not on my own accord. It was filling, food was hot when it came, and the chicken tasted great. They need more non beef and non spicy options."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this for the first time because our favorite Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu was closed that day. Nothing outstanding about the food though nice servers and quick service.  The Ramen we ordered was okay and the side dishes were small in serving. The place also doesn't have whole lot of options if you are vegetarian as almost all dishes are cooked with some kind of meat or fish."}
{"text":"Mom's Kitchen's serves up Korean food that doesn't exactly impress but gets the job done if you're craving it.  The menu is smaller than most Korean restaurants but seems to have the main staples. We ended up getting the gamjatang and two varieties of bibimbap - the original, and the spicy pork. The side dishes were mostly underwhelming save for the kimchi. Their gamjatang was pretty good, the flavour is good (although it was heavier in terms of soybean flavour than most places), and the pork bones was definitely fall off the bone. But that craziest part was that there wasn't enough potatoes! Gamja means potato in korean, how did their gamjatang not have any potatoes? The bibimbap was incredibly standard. I do think it's worth paying more to upgrade from the original and get the extra meat like kalbi/spicy pork as the ground pork was poor. The portion size is pretty large for a bibimbap too.  Markham isn't exactly known for it's good Korean food, and it's still worth the drive to North York, Thornhill, or Scarborough for better Korean options."}
{"text":"Worse Korean food I ever had. I think it is actually open by Chinese hence no Korean taste. I wouldn't come next time. Very disappointed. Food is not fresh."}
{"text":"For someone who loves korean food this place is somewhere you should avoid if you knew what good korean food tasted like. I would drive further for food Korean food than come here again.   Banchan were the saddest things I have seen in my life.   Pork bone soup was too salty and had no potato. Should you call it gamgatang at this point?  Bibimbap was average. I've eaten better. But it's okay if you're looking for a quick fix of bibimbap.  Owned by Chinese people. Sorry. These people can't make korean food.   Will not come back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place because it was close by and for the love of Korean food. The place is fairly small in interior and hard to find on the plaza exterior. Try finding parking underground as opposed to in the plaza because within the plaza, parking spots fill up pretty fast. The actual food menu portion was relatively small for dinner time compared to alot of other Korean restaurants perhaps factoring in the pricing. If you're a big eater it won't entirely fill you up. You can try and ask for extra complimentary appetizers! Also, the food came fairly quickly so that's always a plus! The waitresses were overall quick and attentive but I felt slightly rushed by the waitress when I made and when she received my order."}
{"text":"Not authentic Korean food.  The stars are mainly for the nice waitress we had.  Calamari was from frozen and over fried. Didn't finish them. The kalbi ribs were the the most disappointing especially for the price. They were thin, dried and burnt. Even the onions didn't taste good."}
{"text":"A great little place in Langham Square! The prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. They offer a variety of different Korean dishes.  Your meal also includes 6 little side dishes, which you can refill once (for free).   10/10 would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Judging by the Yelp reviews, I really didn't expect much from this place, but I was hungry, close by, and feeling something different then the usual lunch.  Ordered a KamjaTang and JajangMein take-out,  KamjaTang, surprisingly wasn't a bad it as I thought it would be.  The potatoe texture was perfect, but didn't have any taste.  THE PORK BONE WAS GREAT!!! The soup base for the Pork Bone was there.. and it was flavourful, but it was missing a bit of thickness to it, in other words, it was runny.. I believe it's because they didn't summer long enough or with the right package of ingredients.  The Rice it came with was not Korean rice!   The JajiangMein (although not ordered for me) was horrible.. probably the worst I have ever had, the noodles were not El Dante, the sauce was like out of a can and not even warm. CANNED NOODLES eww.."}
{"text":"The seaweed salad was good and fresh. The spicy pork on rice (\"dweji bulgoki dubbap\") wasn't very spicy and had a lot of oil. The pork was done well though, it was juicy and tender. The size of the food portions was good and the dishes are priced quite low compared to most other Korean restaurants.  Service was average for an Asian restaurant. They speak English and Cantonese here. There was difficulty getting a waitress' attention to pay at the end. Parking is a pain to find because of T&T nearby, you're better off parking below and walking up.  Wifi password is 9056049238. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Came here for the pork bone soup, I agree with other yelpers about the potato, I only got 1 piece and it was still raw.  Taste wise, the pork bone soup was okay but it lacked the spiciness :( Their kimchi was not bad as well, they probably mixed it with Korean hot sauce which made it really saucy  The cost went up to 8.99 with ends up being around 10 so it ain't that cheap anymore :/"}
{"text":"Gamjatang soup $8 .... DELICIOUS. Not disappointed at all. They were great with the sides, we got an extra order because there were 4 of us.   My friends got the bibimbap $9, gyoza $5, bulgogi $12. Everyone enjoyed the food. It would've been even better if it was a tad cheaper. But in this hood, the prices are expected.   Service is great, poor lady was by herself for a full house but she did a great job.   I'm stuffed."}
{"text":"Great place. We ordered Kimchi stew, dukbokki, and a chicken dish (cant recall the name). Everything was super tasty and i had one of those moments where I couldnt get up after eating...ibwas way too full but the food was good.   I've been really into dukbokki and so Ive tried more than a few versions from different restaurants. They made it perfect here. The rice cakes had that satisfying chew that dukbokki lovers seek. As for the chicken and the kimchi stew, great flavours, great spice. Prices are reasonable and comparable to other relatively cheap places like owl of minerva. Dinner costed $38 includong tip for the three dishes. Cant complain!"}
{"text":"Mom's Kitchen is a decent korean restaurant in the neighbourhood. Side dishes banchan are okay. I feel they are stored bought not made by their own.   Main dish portion is smaller than other places yet the price is lower as well.   Service is prompt and friendly though. Good thing is free wifi available."}
{"text":"So Mom's Kitchen is more than likely being ran by Chinese owners instead of a Korean lady as you would expect.   There is only one worker but she's very efficient and fluent in both Cantonese and English.  The menu is small but has staples of what you'd look for in a Korean restaurant.   I ordered the soondubu tofu soup and was very happy with my order. The tofu was silky and smooth. It was definitely cooked to the right amount as it kept its shape and didn't fall apart at the slightest touch. I just wish there was a little more soup and pork ):  My sister and her BF got a pork bone soup which they finished but said the potato tasted weird?  The side dishes were definitely lacking. I usually love the kimchi at any restaurant but this one tasted stale ):  I'll definitely come back when I'm feeling my soondubu though! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here looking for a new place to grab some food. The plaza at this location does have a lot of variety so we decided to check this place out. Its a simple nice, small and clean restaurant with one server working. I ordered the noodles with black bean sauce and pork and it was a large portion but I don't think it was fit for my palette. The description said there was pork but there wasn't much so I decided to order some chicken wings along with it and again small portions and the chicken wings didn't look that appetizing. This is a korean restaurant so I was excited to try some beansprouts that they give at the beginning of the meal but they didn't give me any. And when I asked our server for some beansprouts she didn't know what I was talking about. Overall, I don't think I will be going back here to eat."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Flavour - Had the Gamjatang, the spicy chicken sizzling plate, and kimchi fried rice in separate visits and the flavours were there. 2. Banchan - Varies with each visit.  Free refills are a plus in my books.  Neutral: 1. Cash/debit only - I don't really like places that don't take credit but I guess if that's what it takes to keep the prices reasonable then it's not too bad.  Worth it?: For sure.  Prices are reasonable, food and flavours are good.  One of the better Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Mom's Kitchen is the newest Korean restaurant that opens at The Mall at Langham. Menu is quite similar to most of any other Korean restaurants. Price is quite good as most of the items starts at $7.99.   A+ for service. The waitress really takes the time to go over the menu and make recommendations and help with the spice level. She speaks English and Cantonese.  I ordered a Wooguhji Haejangguk ($7.99) which is the Hangover Soup. The portion is generous with tons of cabbage and bean sprouts. I was surprise to find a few piece of beef short ribs. Extra spicy was requested with addition of pieces of fresh Jalapeno.   Side dish Banchan was weak. Kimichi tasted bland. Since I was eating alone, I was served everything on 1 plate.   Mom's Kitchen does serves some decent Korean food. As there is not much other choice in the neighbourhood, I hope they will do well.  Cash or Debit only."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, YES!  I like the Korean food here, as the \"one chilli\" food is not too spicy.  Sure, you can call me chicken, but I prefer to eat Korean \"mild\" or non-spicy.  So if I tell you that the \"one chilli\" spiciness level at Mom's Kitchen is good for me, and in fact I added MORE chilli sauce into the rice, you should take the hint that the \"one chilli\" level here is just a step up from a hint of heat.  Now that I have set your expectation right, here is the review of the two bibimbaps and a Spicy Pork Dupbap.    We ordered one non-spicy regular bibimbap, and one spicy squid bibimbap (1-chilli).  The portion of both was generous.  Probably the most important ingredient of a bibimbap, the rice was good.  It was soft and supple.  The regular bibimbap had no particular flavour.  Just mixed some banchan in, and the problem was solved.  I tried some of BF's spicy squid.  It was covered in authentic Korean lip-licking-delicious spicy sauce, at maybe medium spiciness level.  Except there wasn't that much sauce.  Once my BF mixed the rice up, the spiciness was mellowed to 1-chilli/mild level.  He scrapped the bottom of the big bowl.  I took that he liked the food.    The Spicy Pork Dupbap was my idea.  It was a good quantity of pork and a bowl of white rice on a plate.  I could tell the pork was not only cooked in the Korean spicy sauce, it was marinated in it.  The spice sipped inside the meat.  No matter how the rice diluted the heat of the sauce, the pork slices remained spicy.  I would call the entree mildly spicy overall.  As previously mentioned, I added more chilli sauce into the dupbap, as I found the contrast between the pork and the rice too big.   So here is the scoop.  Is Mom's Kitchen authentic Korean?  I am no expert, but it tastes similar to the bibimbap I have eaten at many places.  The spicy sauce tastes quite good and spicy, but it is not suicidal spicy like some places.  If you eat non-spicy to medium spicy like myself, Mom's Kitchen hits the sweet spot.  And this is exactly why I rate here 4 stars - I can eat everything on the menu, something I cannot do at many other Korean places.  It helps that the price is very reasonable.  A bibimbap costs $8.  Services was friendly, polite and effective.  The interior decoration is simple and down to earth.  We were given 6 banchan.  They were not memorable, but the good thing is you can order refills."}
{"text":"Waitress was extremely nice and accommodating. When my friend and I first sat down she brought us hot tea right away (it was -13 outside). Upon ordering she made sure we were both ok with the spice level, after hearing that I asked for my Kimchi stew to be prepared extra spicy. When she brought out the side dishes she asked if I (not being East Asian) was comfortable with using chopsticks. Some people might get offended at that but I think it's a nice gesture, and her just trying to be accommodating. Also throughout service I asked for the side dishes to be refilled 2X, and the waitress did so with a smile! Usually at other Korean restaurants the ajummas give me a dirty looks. The reason I'm giving this spot 2 stars is because the food was not good. I'm not Korean, however I love Korean food and have been to many authentic Korean restaurants. The kimchi stew served here was SWEET and had more of a Chinese flavour. This isn't a bad thing but that's not what \"kimchi stew\" is supposed to be. Remember how I asked for extra spicy? Yeah, it wasn't spicy in the least. My friend, who ordered the bibimbap said it was bland. If you're looking for authentic Korean food try some place else."}
{"text":"Wow, when people said the banchan was lacklustre, they weren't kidding. The quality of each varied, but were overall underwhelming.  I came here for dinner one night with three other people. We ordered the spicy pork bibimbap, spicy chicken hot plate, and beef hot plate.  The bibimbap was quite tasty. It's not a dish I usually order, but I really enjoyed it here despite hating carrots. I actually finished the entire thing. The hot sauce they provide you with is not too spicy - more like a sweet spice. You do need to use it to enhance the flavour of the dish though.  I didn't eat too much of the other dishes, but I wasn't very impressed with the beef. The spicy chicken was okay, but since the hot plates were 11.99 each (came with a bowl of rice as well), I'd rather pay the two extra dollars and go somewhere like Ga Bin where the servings are much bigger and tastier. Plus, the banchan there is a lot better.  Mom's Kitchen is not a bad restaurant by any means. As one of the only Korean options in the area, they're able to generate good business. Their food is decent, but not impressive. Service wise, they are very good. I enjoyed my visit, but would not return."}
