{"text":"Excellent service, our waiter was very friendly. I had a strawberry banana crepe and my boyfriend had a mushroom cheese crepe, both were delicious. Cute inside upstairs. Also beer and wine available. I was not, however, impressed by the bird flying around inside, landing on the tables and such."}
{"text":"Looking for crepes? Go elsewhere. Not only is the food pretty bland, but they do not serve tap water to paying customers who are buying food and alcohol. Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"Good crepes. We went in the early evening in September and were the only ones there. We had the nutella strawberry and banana crepe. It was delicious and service was good."}
{"text":"I like the quaint upstairs where the creperie is.  I have ordered both the sweet and the savoury crepes and they were lovely.  The menu's need to be updated and possibly laminated.  I never ordered tap water so I can't complain about that....although it's possible they don't have good tap water in that old building.  It's beautiful and the crepes are good.  Went there once and specifically go back there for crepes."}
{"text":"This was like dining at your crazy neighbor Mr. Wilson's nuclear bomb shelter - except it's not 20 feet underground and there wasn't any toilet paper (except the piece wedged under the table) or water (bottled or from a pipe) available. If experiencing post-WW3 brunch excites you, bomb away."}
{"text":"This place refuses to serve water to paying customers- off to a bad start already.  Plus the food is pretty mediocre.  Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Good morning what says it's going to be a good day like lé creperie de triumph   Tell me when was the last time you tasted heaven before noon.. Second thought don't answer that just come get breakfast.   Let's talk about service   Lovely owner beautiful hommes working and the kindness you'd see in a old land church  Thank you for being one of a kind magic to a old soul surely this will be accounted in your next life   Cheers Bon cherie"}
{"text":"This review is for the Crêperie St. Paul, on the 2nd floor. All interaction was in French and translated here, except where noted.  1) No tap water: $2.50/bottle of 500 mL As others here have noted, the first thing that irked us was no tap water. When the young, seemingly inexperienced waitress (whom I'm going to call Waitress #1) asked if we wanted to start with something to drink, I asked for water. She came back, plopped three bottles of Eska water on the table and proceeded to walk away without a word. I quickly called out, \"Oh, you don't have . . .?\" and she replied quietly, \"No, only bottled water. We don't have tap water.\" I told her to take them back. I noticed a man sitting opposite us with a glass of beer and also an unopened bottle of Eska water. No doubt he was too shy to say anything, but I wasn't going to pay for water if the waitress wasn't even going to mention no other option. She would have let us open up the three bottles (which I found out from the menu was $2.50 each), without saying a word. Strike one: putting down bottled water without saying a word about the cost, or the non-availability of free water, is a lack of customer service. Interestingly, I heard Waitress #2 serving another table in English, and when the customer asked to start with water, Waitress #2 said, \"We only have bottled water. Is that okay?\" So I guess Waitress #1 just didn't care or feel it was part of her job to mention it.      (And really--$2.50 for a 500 mL bottle? That's the price I'd expect to pay at an outdoor festival or a concert, where I'd have few other options, so being ripped off is part of the experience. We're not even talking about imported water--it's a locally-sourced Quebec spring. This is just a blatant cash grab at a tourist trap restaurant that obviously has a sink and tap to prepare foods, but just doesn't want to give its customers drinking water.)  2) Want maple syrup? Shell out an extra $2 Most good crêperies will offer maple syrup. Whether it's real maple syrup or even the cheap imitation stuff, it accompanies the crêpes because it's an expected way to eat crêpes. When I asked the waitress after she had set the plates down and walked away, if she would bring maple syrup, she replied (again, mumbling), \"Yes, but it's extra.\" How much extra, I asked. $2. $12 per crêpe, + $2 for maple syrup? Strike two.  3) Dry, bad crêpes and ingredients We ordered two of the ham-asparagus crêpes, and one of the chicken-Brie-asparagus ($12 each). As a comparison, a crêperie up the street on Place Jacques-Cartier had these same offerings in the $8.75-$10.00 range, but unfortunately, they were closed when we passed by. So for this price, these would surely be fantastic crêpes, right? Wrong. The crêpes were on the dry side (if you've ever made crêpes, you'll know when you've let them sit too long before flipping); the asparagus had several woodsy tips where the food preparer had obviously not properly docked them; and worst of all, the chicken was dry and chewy, like plastic. It's not that hard to prepare good chicken, unless your food has been sitting around for far too long (it was 2:00 pm, still roughly lunch time). I left a few pieces of the inedible chicken and asparagus on the plate so the waitress would know. Strike three.  So by the end of the meal, my experience was: - cheap restaurant that didn't offer tap water - overcharging $2.50 for a 500 mL bottle of water - poor service from waitress who didn't know how to properly communicate these charges, or mumbled under her breath when addressed - (over)charging $2.00 for maple syrup - dry, inedible food  My total bill came to $41.22. As a first in my life, I decided I wasn't going to add a tip for an evidently terrible restaurant experience. Ten seconds later, Waitress #2 ran down the stairs after me. What followed was a 5-minute argument about why I *had* to tip for bad food, bad service, and that none of it was their fault. (Even though she conceded that tip is not mandatory or indicated on the menu as added, she said, \"Here in Montreal, you *have* to tip, 15% minimum.\")  So don't go here unless you're ready for a tourist trap that gouges you, and argumentative, tip-demanding, no-service servers.

{"text":"My wife is 6 months pregnant & was having one of her famous cravings. Crepes!!!  As we were walking on St. Paul street we stumbled upon this cute little place. Upon sitting the staff was very polite & helpful. My wife ordered a Nutella & strawberry crepe and I had a Nutella & banana. The crepes were amazing. They tasted great and the fruit was fresh. I was disappointed to see after eating there all the negative reviews. Definitely would go back again pending my wife's cravings."}
{"text":"Huge, delicious creeps with the European Nutella formula! Yum."}
{"text":"I eat here on every visit...they really know their crepes. This small restaurant upstairs on Rue St. Paul should not be missed. Ambiance is good, quite cozy. They open quite early.   Although a great place for lunch.. we just stopped by only for crepes. We had the nutella and banana ($12)... was delicious. It was thin and not chewy( unlike some creperies). Next time I'll try a mango crepe (sounds interesting).  The service is good, plus for travelers a place with bathrooms and free Wi-Fi is essential.  They have fresh squeezed orange juice ($5)!"}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. Located on the 2nd floor on St. Paul street. Service is average."}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  We asked for a plate to share our various plates instead of passing the large plates around.  They charged us for an empty plate.  Crepes we're very average.  You can not go wrong with Nutella.  Too bad they give Montreal a bad name for tourist treatment."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but not the worst either; just average for me. It was pretty pricey for a simple savory crepe."}
{"text":"An unplanned but a good stop.    I saw a woman just about to eat a banana strawberry crepe on a St.Paul street bench.  Apparently I was hungry and asked her where she got it - that led me to Creperie St.Paul just behind the bench!  A friendly English speaking gal showed me a menu at the door and led me upstairs.  Upstairs is cute lil place with a few tables and a bar where crepes are made.  A couple of tables look out to St.Paul below.    I ordered chicken and bacon crepe that had mozzarella to go and it took only 5 minutes!  I went outside and sat on a bench nearby and tantalized other tourists!   ++. Crepe was deelish!  Savory and warm.  Crepe seems like a better option than wraps any day.    +++  Excellent service!!  Fast and friendly.  They even let me charge my phone that was down to 1%.  They also refilled my water bottle.    - Price is a bit high $15 with tax.  It's in a touristy area but still seemed a bit steep.  Of course, I'd do it again in a heart beat!   -  Parking is non existent.  Best to walk or Uber/cab/metro.  Awesome crepe and great service!  Just writing about it now makes me want one."}
{"text":"We ended up here strolling down the street looking for crêpes. Not many places were open, so we were happy when we came upon this place. We headed upstairs and were instantly welcomed. The crêpes were huge. The fresh oj is perfect. The coffee was good too. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.  We had a few kids with us and the staff was very nice with them, even offering to plus our phone in w music as the kids were dancing around. Such a great vibe."}
{"text":"They refused to give us glasses of water, saying they only had bottles. It took us 40 minutes to get our orders taken, and then another 30 to get our food. One of our friends didn't get her food. Would only come here again if desperate."}
{"text":"We were browsing around old town Montreal on a Sunday morning looking for a good brunch opportunity - but we were not the only one with this intention. So we ended up in this place. Despite the very different ratings (1 star or 5 stars) we decided to stay. The guy at the door was very friendly bringing us up the 2 stairs - we found a lot of room and could choose our table. Nice interior - but you could make more out of it. Service was very friendly no complaints at all (it seems that a very young team is running the place - I like this). We had both a Latte, my wife had the Nutella Crepe and I took the salmon crepe. I have eaten better crepes before but food was good and nice presented - overall nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"While in Old Montreal was looking for a place to have a quick crepe. I viewed the menu while outside the resturant, and it looked good. The staff is very  young and friendly, but not professional.  I saw customers leaving after sitting as no wait staff came to table to anknowledge them.  I ordered a simple ham and cheese crepe, it took about 20 minutes to arrive. It was just ok. I ordered a dessert crepe which was dulce leche with banannas. Both the carmel sauce  and the bannanas were very skimpy.  I got my bill which was $26 for the 2 crepes and a pepsi. Definetly not worth the price. I wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with a friend visiting in town. It's right above the Montréal Poutine place and it's the cutest place. The place was basically empty when we got there around 5, so we nabbed the only seats on the tiny balcony overlooking an open air square surrounded by ivy covered brick walls. It was magical.   The crepes however were nothing too special. Large yes, but not special. A pretty basic menu was given. It was a wrinkled and water crinkled printer sheet type, they should probably invest in proper menus. Savoury and sweet options, about 6-8 of each.   TIP: when getting fruit crepes, ALWAYS get bananas they just taste so much better than strawberries if possible get both.   Friend and i both got a crepe ($10) and a sangria ($5.65) and after taxes it was around $18. I just gave them a $20 and let them keep the rest as tips.   Would most likely come back for the location, not the crepes."}
{"text":"Cute little 2nd floor eatery specializing in sweet or savory crepes. My bff and I stopped by here for dessert because I didn't want to leave Montreal without eating crepes, and I'm glad we did!   We had a nice window seat with a pretty view overlooking the busy shopping crowd and streets below. We both ordered the strawberry and Nutella crepes, and they were scrumptious. Made fresh-to-order, the large crepe was folded over in a triangular pocket encasing TONS of melted, gooey Nutella and chopped fresh strawberries, drizzled with strawberry and chocolate sauce and finished off with a dusting of powdered sugar and a side of whipped cream. So sweet and creamy and melt-in-your-mouth rich. My friend couldn't finish hers but I managed :)  I liked that the exterior of the crepe was crispy and golden, a nice texture contrast to the soft, gooey center. Yummy yum yum, I can't imagine regretting having a dessert crepe here!"}
{"text":"Crepes themselves were pretty decent, can't really complain about the food. But the service was pretty bad: Inattentive staff and slow service. My simple crepe took a long time to arrive even after other tables have been served. By that time my coffee was cold.   When my order did arrive I could only stare at it without a knife and fork to eat it with. Had to ask twice and finally get up myself to ask again. The woman at the next table even had to get up to get her own menu.   And God forbid you ask for a small sip of water with your meal. Despite ordering a $4 coffee they flat out refused to give me even a small sip of tapwater.  If you are in Old Montreal and are desperate for a crêpe I guess it would suffice but otherwise the service  is too lacking to make up for it"}
