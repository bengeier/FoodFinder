{"text":"All their items taste homemade, just like mom makes (or is it Aunt Mary?). I had the greek salad and Banquet Burger, both amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, greasy food. Big portions, and yes very popular with the locals. You cant get a seat in there on weekend mornings. I love their coffee. 
My favorite thing there is their all day breakfast. It tastes just as good at 5 in the evening as it does 8 am.  Take out available."}
{"text":"I just gave it a 1 to be nice! This place is the worst! They food lack flavour and originality! It doesn't taste anything like \"good\" fish and chips! We use to love this place when the old owners where around, they served us what we wanted and it was great! I use to come here when the new management started and noticed the change in the fish quality! Ummmm maybe because they weren't giving me Halibut? One time my fish was orangey the other time it wasn't cooked thoroughly! I hope they improve and if you want real Fish & Chips go to My Place or First Choice F@C! 
It's around because it's the only place you can have a sit down in the area, that's the damn truth!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a local gem. I started coming here in high school and though I have moved away, I still crave the food and make the effort to stop by any chance I get! The variety on the menu is great, but the real deal is the fish and chips. I always order mine with a greek salad and OH MY GOD its to die for! So filling and cheap too! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Good deal on breakfast and awesome fish and chips with a big onion ring on top."}
{"text":"Closed on Sundays.  Cash only.  I really only go for the fish and chips.  Halibut is what i would recommend.  You get a generous portion for the price and the taste is good to good enough.  Recommend you take your food to go.   If you can get by the sometimes questionable clientele (not the best part of Scarborough) it is worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is  amazing.   My favorite dishes are Souvlaki with Greek salad.     Fish and chips are amazing too.  Truly a locall jam,  highly recommended."}
{"text":"If it weren't for my fiance always wanting to go here, I probably wouldn't. 

I'm not exactly a fan of cheap, greasy breakfasts, but he is. I don't really have any complaints, if you come here before 1PM, you get a breakfast of toast, sausage, eggs and home fries for $4.99. It's not bad, and I've certainly had worse, so I'm not complaining. 

We always get the gravy for 75 cents more, because the home fries with gravy are just absolutely delish! 

I haven't tried anything else here as it's become the super close by place with cheap breakfast for us. But I do want to try a 'Super' poutine they got going. If their fries are as good as their home fries with gravy, I wouldn't mind at atll! I believe that certain poutine comes with hamburger meat, and something else I can't remember from the top of my head.

If you live in the Scarborough Golf/Lawrence area, be sure to drop by for breakfast! Very friendly people here, and they remember your face! Always a good thing.

TIP (not sure how to add from desktop, without a mobile) - They are closed on Sunday's, and generally close at 8PM on every day. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to get fish and chips. They also have a cheap breakfast plate and it is enormous. The fish and chips is a big portion size and is costs between $6-10 depending on what you get. Their staff is often very friendly and they give you tons of tartar sauce if you request it. I ordered the haddock and chips and even tho it's the same cost as halibut and chips, it is a lot bigger."}
{"text":"greasy spoon, badly in need for renovations, however they do an awesome breakfast with big portions!  if you go before one you pay 4.99!  Great burger combo, big portion also however do NOT order the fish and chips, greasy!  The servers are top notch, fast and efficient and your coffee is bottomless!  OH, unfortunately cash only at this place!  If you can get past the dingy decor and the ceiling then go for breakfast and you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I hate to put down peoples taste in food, but are you people raving about this place out  of your minds?  This place serves mediocre food at best.  The quality of fish is poor, aswell as the pork and chicken used for their souvlaki's.  If you want cheap food I guess it works but if you want real fish and chips go to highland or mccowan fish and chips, those places are the real deal.

P.S. a customer found a cockroach in their coffee one day, that's all you need to know about this place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good fish & chips, charming decor & atmosphere. The rushing waitress apologized for their expensive soft drinks - which are something like $1.35 - and we didn't have the heart to tell her that isn't expensive at all! 

The fish is heavy on the batter, but if you want that sinful fish & chips platter in a place with no pretensions, this place is perfect. Feels like a 1950s diner without the front counter or, thankfully, the racism. At least as far as I saw."}
{"text":"Good portions for fish and chips.very popular with locals."}
{"text":"Be very careful to look at your bill as I was charged $4 for something that wasn't even what I was suppose to be charged for. I won't mention what I ordered but when I went to inquire about the cost of this \"extra\" charge. I was told it was for \"this\" and I said I didn't order \"that\" and the guy said well sorry but we charge \"extra\" I told them I wasn't going to be paying \"extra\" for something that I didn't order. 

So just be very careful as they seem to want to make up \"assumption\" charges for something you didn't even order.

BTW didn't pay the \"extra\" charge. I put down my money that was minus the \"extra fake charge\" and walked out never to return again."}
{"text":"If you like your fish and chips crispy with just the right amount of tasty batter, aunty Mary's is the answer. For the price and serving! Bang for your buck and untop of that the service was efficient, clean and on point - salud"}
{"text":"Listen here jerks: 

If you want the real deal on Fish n' Chips its happening at Scarborough Golf Club and Lawrence. 

Sure the plaza is sketchy - Sure the locals would jump you for your teeth - but by god if you can make it past the front door you are in for one helluva meal. 

Family run business, cheap food, friendly service, and most of all THE BEST ONION RINGS I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. 

(no joke, order them and you'll agree!). 

To be honest I haven't tried EVERYTHING on the menu, I typical stick to the greek food / halibut - but it's safe to say that the food is good across the board. 

Please go here. 

Right. now - even if its closed. 

... we'll break in *shhh*"}
{"text":"Not worth the money!

Fish and chips $6.99 composed of 2 square pieces of haddock fish and store-bought fries."}
{"text":"I had heard this was a good place for fish and chips and was in the area so thought I'd try it. Well first of all when I walked in the entrance i could smell what seemed like a backed up toilet. Not a good first impression. Then I saw the sign that they take cash only. Who doesn't take some form of plastic these days? Instead of listening to my instincts i went to get cash and returned. I ordered the fish and chips, not sure if I got halibut or haddock because the server didn't ask which I wanted and there was no printed menu just a menu over the counter area.

I must say the place looks like a real dive, very run down and in need of some renovations. The food came very quickly and the server seemed quite efficient. The fries were supermarket frozen fries, and they weren't very appealing. The fish batter was just dripping with grease as was the one onion ring on top of the fries. I was only given one napkin and I used that to try to soak up the grease. I had a vision of their deep fryer and I though I bet the oil never gets changed. Anyways I got an upset stomach within about an hour of eating there. 

Weirdly enough I got my bill and it just said fish and chips and Pepsi but no detailed price nor a total. So my bill when I went to the cash register to pay was $12 and change. 

Needless to say I won't be back. I'm really surprised at some of the reviews where people said 'best fish and chips in the city'. The fish itself wasn't even nice and flaky the way it's supposed to be so I suspect it's was frozen as well."}
{"text":"Had takeout one time but the Fish and Chips were crispy and delicious.  The greek salad has everything I love in a greek salad too!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips and onion rings. Breakfast so cheap and good. Service always  good and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Beef souvlaki, Greek salad, fish and chips! Yum! Friendly staff! Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite place for fish and chips.  I always order the fish with greek salad and it comes with a few fries. So good!  I didn't give 5 stars because we haven't had success with their breakfast as their steak is always overcooked and the eggs aren't usually made as ordered.  We've been going here for over 7 years and will continue to.  We do take outs now but used to order in."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and the portions were huge!! The souvlaki I ordered could feed two people not just one and the fish and chips was split between two people and there were still left overs."}
{"text":"The worst fish'n chips EVER!  I ordered halibut but most definitely DID NOT receive halibut.  Greasy as hell.  The best part of this trip was the cheap price, I should have known!  I think they use to be good but have changed owners!  I would not even recommend buying food for my dog here!"}
