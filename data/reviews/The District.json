{"text":"Food was good and our service was excellent. Our server, Riley was very friendly and nice, and did a great job."}
{"text":"Love this place but even better is the service. Ashley is the bombdizzle!  If you don't cum here your missing out."}
{"text":"Bad service and pretty good food. We've been here for 30 minutes and have only gotten fries so far we tried to order and the server said she was going to get drinks for another table and ended up taking their order instead so now we are waiting here for our food while the other tables that walked in after us are eating. I just want my milkshake!!!! Wings we bad there was no meat, burgers were asked to be rare and they were all well done. Manager was sassy. Very disappointed not coming back even though we have a groupon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch football games. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"They guy at the door wearing a K-mart shirt and Walmart pants with knock off Converse told me that I couldn't get in wearing a silk button up and leather panths... Maybe if he got a raise he could properly disifer what quality clothes look like"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to get a burger in old town! It's juicy and full of flavor. You can't beat the price of a $5 burger during happy hour!  When it comes to the night, the District is full of energy and stands out against the other bars in the area. Music is loud, bartenders are good, and the patrons are full of energy.  Definitely a newer \"young\" bar for college-mid 20s / early 30s, but I would recommend to party goers of all ages!"}
{"text":"Drooling just thinking about our dining experience. Sooooooo flipping AMAZING!!! We got the Californication and the Firemen Burgers, Sweet Potato Tots, and the Plain Jane and Chocolate Shakes. All of which were 5 stars! My husband also got the IPA on draft (can't remember the name-they only have one) he said it was the best he ever had and he drinks lots of IPAs...good and enjoy. PS, we went at 6pm there were families eating there but I wouldn't take a family past 7ish...the night crowd was emerging from underground!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at the district with a friend using the Groupon offer and got Fuego fries added on.   The Fuego Fries are on Fire! The shakes are pretty good too, but our burgers were not cooked to order and were unappetizing. Also, we were not greeted or seated which was awkward, and our servers forgot our orders.   Left hoping they run a better club than restaurant.  The Fuego fries are worth trying if they are kept on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Had a great time. Our server Kassie was fantastic! Will definitely be back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here while it was a nightclub. We bought a Groupon deal for lunch. Usually you don't think places that are a nightclub will have a good lunch menu with quality food. Boy I was wrong, it was AMAZING! I had a Harlem Shake and my husband had a Fireman burger. It was quality meat and the flavor was outstanding. Service was 5 stars also, three staff members checked on us. I had the bottomless mimosas and our server Kelsey was always there to fill it up before it was empty. Kelsey knew the menu well and was very friendly. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite spot in Scottsdale during our Spring Training trip! I was across the street at Bottled Blonde with my girlfriend, my friend and his girlfriend. My friend and I spot two beautiful women dancing across the street on top of the bar at The District and we immediately asked ourselves what we were doing here. We convinced the girls to head over-best decision ever!  Wait was a little long to get in, but well worth it. I felt like we were in Vegas when we walked in-the women dancing on the bar were wearing practically nothing and my girlfriend asked me for $1 to stick in her G-String. Are you kidding me? How could I not give this place 5 stars! Music was great, everyone was dancing, and it didn't take long to get drinks. Bartender was having fun too-he would pass our beers between the legs of the dancers on the bar with a shit eating grin on his face the entire time.   All in all a great spot to party! We will definitely be coming back here next year!"}
{"text":"As a corporate pilot, I have eaten burgers all across the globe from Hong Kong to Burkina Faso I consider myself an international burger connoisseur.  Many of the restaurants I've visited advertise 'voted best burger' only to turn out to be flavorless or dry necessitating drowning it in ketchup to make it palatable.  Many places can get it right once but I don't consider a place 'great' unless it can produce the same quality on a consistent basis.  I have been to the district 3 times and each time I order the same thing and it has been excellent.  The burger is full of flavor and the bun is fresh. If you are looking for a great burger in the Phoenix area, there is no other place to go.  I put the districts burger in my top 10 best for burgers anywhere in the world."}
{"text":"Went with our kiddos and it was great food. Place is a quite loud but lot's of TV to keep entertained. Burgers were great and cooked to order and the shakes were out of the world.  Drawback was there is not a kids menu. Server Ashley was great in recommending burgers and shakes and kept up with the refills and great service.  Would be a great place for a guys night or a group setting not really a great place to go with kiddos."}
{"text":"BURGERS! BURGERS! I love the burgers.  Had an amazing burger here over Super Bowl weekend and the chef came out to make sure he prepared everything to our liking.  Very enjoyable experience.  It's definitely a place worth frequenting!"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest staff. They're busy hanging out and talking to each other than taking care of customers. Food is over hyped and it's a limited menu."}
{"text":"Gotta try the fuego fries they're AMAZING! Our server Kelsey was great she recommended the fireman burger it was delicious! All together we had a great experience with exceptional service and food. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was amazing! The chef came and greeted us at the table. Loved the milkshakes! Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Had the best burger ever.  We did a groupon but have to say would pay full price...the service was great thanks to our bartender, Sam. She was amazing served us  great margaritas and was fun to talk with made our day . definitely  will come back for both the food and Sam"}
{"text":"very shallow place. the dump security pig at the door treated us like crap. gave him our IDs to check and didn't believe we were the people in our pictures. and the next two \"white girls\" behind us got in with out an issue. I say F--k this place."}
{"text":"Ashley is awesome! She took care of us and made our night! The food was great and huge portions. The shakes are killer. Ashley pulled it all together"}
{"text":"Disclaimer...this review is not for the nightclub; in fact, it's more of a daytime, late-lunch, early dinner, happy-hour review. Burgers - exceptional, juicy, well seasoned, tasty nestled in soft brioche buns. Onion rings - hot, crisp, yum and the garlic aioli a great compliment. Shakes - chocolate creamy tasty brownie surprise delish-ness. Local beers - makes me happy (or hoppy, depending on your choice). Staff - pleasant, friendly, helpful :)"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Kind of pricey for what it is.  Burger was good.  The shake was just ok.  Service was fine.  Nothing to really write home about.  Wouldn't go out of my way to go here again but would go with someone who wanted to go because it was not bad."}
{"text":"We were in town for my brother's birthday and they chose to get a couple of tables at the District on a Saturday afternoon/evening.  It was packed but the server we had at our tables was great and the other girls helping her out were always around for anything we needed.  Super fun experience, they had sound on for the NCAA basketball games and had a DJ playing in between, great environment, really cool looking out over the pool at Maya as well, will definitely return on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Again I stopped into this place. And again they killed it. The bartenders were dancing and so were the go go dancers. The DJ was on point and overall a great time.  This place will take over for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"So Basketball Jerseys are not allowed but no shirt and tank tops are ok in the middle of the day??? Because as the bouncer said \" we don't want to attract the wrong crowd\" it's 3:00 on a Saturday during NBA playoffs you make no sense"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great music, not too crowded, bartenders were awesome. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Been hitting this place up on Thursdays for a minute. Food is excellent and always how I ordered it. The management,  Clarence, & Cole always do a great job taking care of us when we come in. And Ciara & Courtney takes the best care of us at the bar and when we get a table. If you haven't checked this place out then you are missing out. They have definitely earned a long time customer."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food. Brought my kids over to eat as hubby is out of town and I did not feel like cooking. Plus i know I can watch the Cubs game as well!!  My only complaint was that I could not have a normal conversation with my family at our table, or even order my food with the waitress as the TV (packers football) and music (played at commercials) was extremely loud. I thought it was just me because im old, but I could see others leaning into other peoples ears to talk and I find that to be a real big turn off. I had to repeat myself a few times for each of our orders and she had mention that she was going to ask if they could turn it down, but i didn't notice a difference. As we were leaving, we passed another family that was hesitating to come in, I assured them that the food was phenomenal, but forget the conversation. Just text each other. She laughed and agreed. It was too loud. Sorry, I hate complaining. so maybe try finding a middle ground??"}
{"text":"Good: friendly, no intimidating bar staff; DJ was spinning good music  Bad: drink prices were outrageous especially considering the low amount of alcohol mixed into them - it's another thing if you pay top dollar for a great, strong cocktail. Prices may be in line with old town bars but that doesn't mean they're good drinks.  Ugly: patrons who show up for nightlife are not the cream of the crop so don't expect much as far as courtesy goes. If you have any respect for yourself and you're not already drunk, don't go here. No room to dance either despite great music. Overall, the establishment is confused as to what it exactly is when it comes to nightlife."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the Memphis Burger and my friend had a make your own. It was the bomb. Sweet potatoe tots were great, ask for crispy. Rylee our server was very attentive and nice. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. if you can get any!! Also don't expect a tip if I've been waiting 20 minutes at the bar to order and then have you be a total jerk to me! I only tip when you do your job well (if at all)! This is America where tipping is optional to begin with."}
{"text":"First for the one positive the atmosphere is pretty unique and rather cool. But this was one of my worst experiences ever. We walked in around 1pm. We sat at a table on one of the two patios. After waiting over 15 mins and no server comes to us the guy repairing the TV  who does not even work there asked if we have been helped. We said no and he apologized said he was not part of the wait staff but was nice enough to go and get us some water and menus and tell someone at the bar of our existence. Finally a server comes over were we order our two burgers, one side, and our two shakes. After about 20 mins a guy comes over and literally sort of throws our food down and runs away before we can get one word off. Needless to say we now have no silverware and need some more water. So we wait patiently for no joke another 15 mins when finally my boyfriend walks over and asks the bartender if he has any silverware and if the burger \"the jungle\" is suppose to not have a bun. He seemed confused as to why the kitchen made it without a bun. Needless to say the burger had no bun. He was nice enough to give us some silverware and brought us out a bun for his burger. After that ordeal we ask him were our onion rings were and shakes. No joke another 15 mins later after we had already finished our burgers the onion rings are brought out. And of course the person that brought them did not say one word. Or ask us how we were doing. Once again someone not part of the wait staff a security guard asks if we are okay. I then politely asked for some more water. Finally after another 15 mins a girl comes over and we ask if we can please get our shakes and the check. another 15 mins later are shakes finally come. But we are once again waiting for the check... Overall our lunch lasted over 2 hours and at this point all we wanted to do was LEAVE!!! Finally we got the check and we were able to leave. I would never recommend this place! I have never ever ever ever seen such horrible service!!!! I know it is more of a club vibe but still this was just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Place was absolutely freezing but sll garage style doors and even door itself was open. Waitress would go behind bar, put on coat, take off again to go out on floor. How about just closing the doors as it was 48 degrees outside? No wonder the place was deserted, it was so uncomfortable to eat! Food was good I did not care for the small wood handled \"plate\" they served the burgers on, no room to set things aside or be comfortable eating, and it just seemed unsanitary."}
{"text":"We stopped by the District last Sunday to grab some drinks and watch football. The place was pretty busy but the bartenders were very attentive and friendly. Plenty of screens to catch the game from anywhere in the place. After eating and drinking for a couple of hours our bill was also surprisingly low. Definitely a nice place to watch sports, drink and have a good time."}
{"text":"A piece of crap bartender gave me the wrong drink and told me I \"ordered it that way\" when I called out his mistake. He was rude and I will never go back to this rip off. Terrible bar."}
{"text":"Great spot , burgers are good.   Can't beat the Maya Day-Night Club combination. Fresh concept."}
{"text":"Courtney rocks. She and the bar staff took good care of our group all night long.  Recommend a visit.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"$15 mismos all day Saturday and Sunday!! what!!!? i went there last Sunday and wow was the scene almost better than RnR and el Hefe.. my bartender, Christiano i believe, was very on top of it which is hard considering bottomless mismos can be very difficult to keep up with..  I will return next Sunday and I think The D is gunna give el hefe a run for their money but if your gunna beat el hefe, you gotta have girls on the bar dancing && have ass in people faces because at the end of the day thats all we want.."}
{"text":"Their firehouse burger is too die for!!!! The service was a little lacking but nothing overly outrageous to keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Great little sports bar across the street from the W Hotel. If Sam isn't your bartender or server, then switch seats until she is. Friendliest, most attentive server we've had in Scottsdale. Not your average Jersey girl. The cheese curds are decent--although not exactly like the ones in my native WI. Huge burgers. Good drinks. Lots of TVs. But...Sam. Seriously. She got them the 5th star."}
{"text":"$14 for two under-poured shots of fireball. Drinks are way overpriced. This place is your standard old town club/bar that is in business for a year then closes. I understand they are trying to increase their margins by over charging for drinks but this is ridiculous. Why would anyone go here? If you're going to pay for over-priced drinks you'd expect a good atmosphere or at least some kind of benefit but this place is lacking."}
{"text":"The food is great, the drinks are awesome, but the service is the ultimate deal.  I have never had better service at any bar or restaurant than I have at any establishment in any major city-these folks knew what they were doing-and did it very, very well. Jackie was an amazing baryender and server, would recommend anyone hust to come here and see her alone. Try their whiskey sours for a refreshing afternoon cocktail!"}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale for the WMO.  If you book a table here, don't count on actually getting the table that you booked.  We went to the door and they said that they had no record of our reservation and if we wanted a table it would be $3500 minimum instead of the $700 that we booked.  Blatant liars and dishonest people working here.  Later that night the 30k millie joker of a GM finally admitted that we did have a reservation but still decided to rape us on the table.  Great way to ruin what should have been a fun weekend.  Book a table anywhere but here, Dakota, Bottled Blonde, Whiskey Row... this place knows how to hold you hostage and put a gun to your head when you have no other options... great way of conducting business... hopefully others will choose to spend their money elsewhere... I will never step foot in that trash ball venue again and I hope others will heed this review and do the same."}
{"text":"Went out of curiosity via Groupon, but was duly impressed. The recipes for the burgers (and everything else on the menu for that matter) were great. I was impressed by the food, overall, and consider it world class. As long as it stays the same over time it is a winner in my book. I am reviewing the food only, as the atmosphere is something else entirely. It is a club, and by virtue of that, it is bright and noisy (really noisy) and not really comfortable per se. The bartender that served me did a good job, but it was difficult to get his attention. But my review is about the food. Without going into detail, the burgers were really delicious, best I've had in a long time. Chef Ramsay would approve! Oh yes, the 3-7 happy hour deals are something to get excited about too! $5 burgers, $3 sides...yum!"}
{"text":"Sunday funday worthy. Good drinks. Good vibe. And close to other bars. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"As a Happy Hour spot:  EXCELLENT.  $5 Burgers, not to mention cheap shakes, beers, and sides, too.  When my wife and I came, it was not crowded at all, so we got to relax on one of their couches.  I only wish the couches weren't facing the bar, so we could take advantage of Old Town's excellent people-watching.  As a Restaurant:  MEH.  The food isn't amazing.  We both agreed the burgers, fries, and shakes looked better than they tasted.  Service was fine.  Our server was definitely busy, but very sweet.  Like a lot of other places around town, they offer Bottomless Mimosas on the weekend, but cap it at 5 for $15.  Not a bad deal at all.    Overall, I would recommend this as a Happy Hour spot for when bar-hopping around Old Town, or to grab a quick bite before heading into Maya, which it's connected to.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Completely mediocre burger. It was ok, but not great. For the price, I'd go elsewhere.   The sweet potato tots were actually grossly sweet. I love most things sweet potato, so this was a shocker for me. I hated them. They were way too sweet. No idea how they managed to ruin sweet potato tots, but they did. It was sad.  Doubt I'd get food from there again."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5-stars if they weren't so unethical, its a fun place and cool environment.  Twice now they have overcharged me on my bar tab, ie. a $34 tab which I signed and tipped $6 should equal $40, I was charged $51.  This was the second time, the first time I went to close my tab at the bar and the bartender said \"oh, we already closed your tab\" without me signing anything.  They gave me no receipt or anything for the amount.  I later see my credit card was charged $70, $30 and $5, none of which I was offered a receipt for.  I believe we spent around $50-$60, not $105.  I called the bar, no one has ever answered the phone, I also emailed from their website with no response.  I don't care about the money so I won't be fighting it (not worth my time) but if I ever go back here or to Maya, I will be paying with cash only.  Be careful as well, they will not let you in wearing a Bulls jersey while the Bulls are playing a playoff game on every tv in the bar....yet people with no shirt are welcome to roam freely."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on this place explaining how I didn't enjoy my stay. While I maintain that a negative review does reflect a person's experience at a place of business, I was perhaps being a bit harsh on a place that is trying to fit in the scene. It may be unfair of me to voice my displeasure towards a place with no room, talking space, cheap drinks since all of Old Town Scottsdale is the same way.   I don't like Old Town, but I can manage a way to have fun with a little liquid courage at most places. My experiences at this place have not been fun. I believe that this place is great for others, just not for me. Much like how I love Calamari and others don't share that same affinity.   I will however improve my star rating of this place based solely on the fact that I had someone personally reach out and tell me how unfair I was being and I kinda agree for some reason. So I apologize for being a dick. Carry on District. Perhaps I will try you again sometime, but in the meantime, here's a neutral rating."}
{"text":"Another poorly undercooked burger a few weeks back. Manager was nice and comped drinks, but serving a burger raw in the middle after requesting well done means you need a new chef."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I came here on a Saturday night with a friend. We initially went to Maya but there was a door you can go through that connects it to this place so we thought, \"Why not?\"   The crowd was evenly all ages and a fair mix of guys and girls. It really felt like a house party, there wasn't a specified location for a dance floor so people were just going at it all over the place. It was also incredibly packed, so not a lot of room to go around. The dj was okay, mostly edm. It was another sports bar gone \"dance club\" at night.   It reminded me of Hi-Fi, El Hefe, and Bottled Blond, so if you're a patron at those places, you'll love this one. But if you're like me and like actual dance clubs like Cake, Mint, and Maya, you probably won't like this place. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Boy is it hot outside... We heard good things about the burgers here so we decided to venture outside of our Sunday safe zone of restaurants and tried out this place. I understand that it's an open area next to Maya but it was quite warm sitting at the bar. You'd think there would be a fan of some sort available to keep guests cool. I was sweating the whole time I was here. We came with a Groupon for 2 burgers, 2 shakes and a side. Our burgers were good but nothing memorable. The fries we ordered were so bland... It seemed like they sprinkled paprika on just for presentation and nothing else. There were exactly 11 people at the bar. My boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary when we first got here and when he finished it, it took quite a long time before he was asked if he would like another drink. The bartender walked by a few times without asking a thing. I had the bottomless mimosas for $15. Not too bad... It's kinda what every place in old town does. We are still waiting on our milkshakes. Asked for them for them to be taken to go and it's been at least 10 minutes. It's kind of awkward sitting here waiting for them after paying and all already. We'll see if those are any good. Honestly though, I don't think we'll be back. Nothing stands out and service was just okay. There are plenty of other joints in old town to try out."}
{"text":"LIFE CHANGING BURGER ALERT!!   Fun and dynamic atmosphere with great service & a gorgeous staff. Definitely a go-to bar any time, day or night. The food is impeccable and the night scene is always a great party. You can't go wrong!  There are two full bars, one inside and one outside, which means quick service even on the busiest nights. The music is always awesome and appealing to every taste. You can eat, play, dance, chill and party all in one location.   Wait, did I mention the burgers?   I wish i could give this place 6 stars. I highly recommend visiting The District next time you head out to Scottsdale. It's  a must!"}
{"text":"Our server name was Courtney. Very personable. She made our first visit exciting. I had the turkey burger it was excellent. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Dang, their burgers are good here. Their milkshakes are also delicious. I appreciate that their menu is focused (They've found what they're good at and they stick to it). We discovered them from a Groupon, and have been back a few times since because they food is amazing and they have an excellent happy hour! The staff is also super friendly and helpful. Definitely recommended! It's in old town, though, so parking is sometimes tough."}
{"text":"Great Place! Fantastic Burgers, and shakes and Margueritas! Great Bartender  Courtney with super service! We will be back this week!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband a few weeks ago and we both ordered burgers. I'm not a burger fan but I really didn't joy myself at the district as well as my burger.  We both had a shake which was really good.  I checked in on Yelp's website and was able to use the offer of a one cent draft drink. I ordered an IPA which I normally don't like but it was an orange flavour and was pretty good!   The location was a little hard to find but once we got there we were curious about the pool outside.  I think if I were 10 years younger, I probably would like this place more!"}
{"text":"For those looking for a Packer bar in Scottsdale/Phoenix continue the search. We had the unfortunate experience of watching the NFC championship game at the district. The bar service was awful, the bartenders were more interested in trying to pick up girls and chat with friends than serve drinks and food. The game management was equally awful. The sound was not broadcasted on the sound system till game time and they cut it off all together in the third quarter. There are several other options like Casey Jones and Buffalo Chip in the area that are true Packer bars."}
{"text":"We LOVED The District during our visit to Scottsdale for Spring Training and Girls Weekend Out!  Reno was the best bartender and we were treated like princesses!  Great music, great crowd, so much fun!!!"}
{"text":"Hippest place to go for loud and fun times.  Formerly  the north end of Maya cabanas, is now the epitome of old town Scottsdale fun!   Where do we go after college is over?  Here of course.    DO NOT go here if you are looking for a relaxing and quiet lunch or dinner.  If you bring kids near this place you might be a kid still yourself.  This is a place for EDM goodness and loud DJ's.  PS: forget about ordering food here unless you are too wasted to walk but just ok not to be kicked out.  Takes forever and they most likely will send your food to the other side of the bar.  However, if you do get the food, Congrats!   You have managed to not pass out before your food gets to you!  The burgers here  are very tasty especially if you have been basking in the sun all day at Maya's pool!"}
{"text":"The district is fun! Joseph let me and my 4 friends in for $5 each, and then pocketed the cash for himself. I wish he hadn't groped the ladies that I was with but they were hot so I understand. Great bar! Way too crowded though. Next time I'll go next door."}
{"text":"This place is great. Kim D. Really made our experience great.she was on time when we needed refills for our bottomless mimosas and made a our experience great. Will for sure come back!!"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter if there is a DJ playing next door or something is going on, I always end up at District. The place itself is really cool and I love the staff there. They have two main bars that are split up so there is plenty of room to walk around. Lot's of TV's as well and overlooks the maya pool. Go GO GO !"}
{"text":"Fun place, but they really need to get that bathroom situation under raps. The guys line was at least 40 people long at all times.  I spent probably 45 minutes of the night waiting in line to take a pee. Talk about a buzzkill."}
{"text":"I went here, last week some time, using a groupon. It was the kinda late afternoon, so there was only a couple of people in there, which was perfection. I walk in and the decor is amazing, open, contemporary and rustic, my favorite. They are located next to a day spay so its right next to this really nice pool area. The girl working the bar took my order, she was really nice and helpful. The food was really good, and you get a lot for your money. I had a burger, sweet potato fries and chocolate milkshake. I would recommend this place and go back in the future. It was a very pleasant and chill experience."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon for 6 burgers, 3 sides and 6 shakes.  They were really good burgers. We also had fries and onion rings.  They were ok, but nothing to write home about. Shakes were unique and good.  Took a while to get our food...was the only downside.  It also was a younger crowd, which I certainly have no issue with but was very loud (music playing) and hard to have a conversation with the people we were with.  That is the point of going out to eat isn't it.... to enjoy the company you are with?  But, it was good food and lots of it and a bargain with the Groupon coupon. Not sure we would go back with the noise....but may order to go sometime with another groupon coupon!  Wonder if they allow a to go order with it?"}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Scottsdale as an adult (twice-both during the Phoenix Open) we have ended up with a table at the District.  Again, the only times I have come here are during the weekend of the Phoenix Open so I don't know how much that sways the vibe but I have always had an amazing time here! Great service and atmosphere, and I love their bottle presentation. All in all, a great place to party and I will definitely be back if I can handle the trouble of another Phoenix Open weekend, which is debatable."}
{"text":"On my 2nd trip to Scottsdale, I made my rounds bar hopping in the Entertainment District and can say officially that I've been to every bar there. Among all the bars in the area, I think that The District is my favorite. My experience this time around was so much better than last year's, and I wouldn't have wanted to cap our night at any other place. The bouncers were cool and didn't stand around like robot douchebags. The music was just as good as I remembered with a mix of Top 40, hip hop, EDM, trap, etc. For a Saturday night on a holiday weekend (Martin Luther King), the place didn't feel so claustrophobic with people. The bathrooms were clean and maintained pretty well through the night. I had such a great time partying here, and I look forward to coming here again on my next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"WOW, OMG & Mmm are a few 3 letter phrases that describe the quality, flavor and creativity of their food!  Not your standard bar food.  We came in and got Burgers, Onion Rings and Milkshakes.  The Burgers were enormous, and so tasty!  I got the Harlem Shake burger, which was a burger topped with a home made pastrami, Russian dressing and cole slaw.  The flavor was insane, just bursting out of it!  Very juicy, and was on a homemade Brioche bun that was soft and buttery.  The onion rings were awesome, beer battered and huge.  The Milkshakes were a delicious treat as well.  The burgers and sides are served on wooden cutting boards, nice stylish touch for a modern unique bar.  Definitely recommend coming here!  Also, their happy hour boasts $5 burgers, so great time to come try a burger with a beer."}
{"text":"We bought a table for the night and bought 3 bottles over the course of 3 hours. We were respectful of our server and asked for the simple tasks that are within the limits of a servers job. At the end of the night and we were paying our tab the server came back to the table and confronted the bill payer about the tip he left. It is completely inappropriate in any situation for a waitress to approach a guest about a tip and to complain. We were dumbfounded and couldn't believe that after a fun night out we were left with a bad taste in our mouths. On top of it, our out of town friends were told that they \"don't have money\" because there cards were declined. The level of disrespect was amazing to me. Thanks for nothing District"}
{"text":"Music was absolutely amazing however I'm only giving this place 3 stars. I'm giving this place 3 stars because you guys let dudes cut the line without paying even though it wasn't even the guest list line and you guys need to make the guys bathroom bigger. I was extremely shocked just like everyone else that there were only 3 stalls. Fix this and I'll give 5 stars"}
{"text":"I will challenge anyone who wants to argue the best burger in Phoenix, because this place has it. I've downed plenty, and it was one of those when you know, you know.   When you come here, ask for Steve. Dude will take the best care of you. Very friendly, respectful and great at his job. Out of any bar I've been to in Scottsdale, this is the place with the best service. Lots of respect to the managers here. I'll be coming back here many of times."}
{"text":"Was going out with a friend for the night and found this place via Groupon.  Excellent burgers with a very friendly bar staff.  They also have great deals for happy hour."}
{"text":"I was here with my friends & there was a drunk man creeping hard on any group of ladies. I told a security guy & the creeper was immediately kicked out. It immediately made me feel safe as a female in a bar. Thank you for listening! Also they have deep Eddy's grapefruit - yum!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I was glad they had option for vegetarian patty. But the frys we're rubbery and not seasoned. It is next to maya pool and club. So it was very crowed and noisy. Am not sure if it is affiliated."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday. They have a great dayclub and big party vibe. We loved it. The food was great. The service was even better!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place because of groupon, decided to try it for lunch. So I walked in here this week , 2 guys working behind the bar ignored me completely, looked RIGHT at me and completely dismissed me. There was a total of FOUR customers in the whole place, so I sit down to wait for my friend, she shows up and we sit down at a table. Out pops a waitress, completely sweet and adorable! I tell her about the groupon and she got us started with our meal. She was helpful and quickly got us squared away. Within a reasonable amount of time she brings out 2 insanely delicious milk shakes, about 10 minutes later she brings out 2 really nice burgers and some nasty nasty nasty onion rings. Seriously these were like Burger King, small...chopped onions in them and funky breading. My friend and I laughed because there was a GREAT pub style onion ring on one of our burgers. I would try this place again, but I have to take one star away from because of the 2 that completely ignored me and one for  the NASTY frozen, gross onion rings."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, fries, onion rings, sweet potato tots and fried pickles! Ate during lunch time. Super loud club scene at night but very quiet relaxing spot during day. Check lunch hours though as they varied from the 2 days we went."}
{"text":"I completely understand the whole \"bringing the outside in\" vibe, but The District has taken it to a whole new level. I think leaving all of the doors and windows open has caused the AC bill to be as high as their fly count... Also, if I wanted marinara sauce on my chili cheese fries I would have ordered a pizza."}
{"text":"Service was decent & food was delicious. Super hot and fresh when we ordered. The atmosphere was wild on a Saturday night which was expected at a bar in the area. While we were waiting for our check, a server set an open carafe of water on our table & many around us - kind of scary considering anyone could just spike the water with something and I doubt anyone would notice. Lots of drunk people around who would likely drink that water too."}
{"text":"The burgers here are always great, along with the toppings and dipping sauces. Service is great too. Taylor and Chrissie were awesome and friendly.  I understand that there is a cost to a business to accept credit cards. It should not be passed to a customer by penalizing them for using a card!  At $15 for a shot of Jameson I think they are making a good profit.  It is like paying more at Basha's for not using cash."}
{"text":"This review is for the groupon and food.  I think the groupon is deceiving.  This is only a savings if you go after happy hour.  ALL burgers are $5 from 4-7.  The menu reads all burgers come with fries.....unless you use a groupon as your waitress points out, then your burgers come with one shared side for an additional $5.  So during regular dinner hours your 2 burgers come out to $10, since you aren't given the fries that accompany the burgers the charge is $5 and 2 shakes for $14.  The grand total is $29 so your groupon saves you a total of $9, which isn't close to 50%.  Since they charge you tax, I can't help but think that is why they increase the price by $5 with a side that comes included with burgers if you didn't have a groupon.  The bread was stale, the red peppers soggy and cold out of a jar and the Jungle had so much garlic I can't taste anything else an hour later.  My boyfriend order firehouse burger which supposedly had bacon...one strip.  He ordered without red onions and you guessed it onion.  The burger was a soggy mess but had quality meat.  The shakes were good but don't love up to their $7 price tag.  The waitress said everything on the menu was her favorite. We won't be back unless I need protection from vampires."}
{"text":"Jadah was the shit. She should be a manager because she has the best attitude ever. She was super accommodating and very genuine and cares about her customers. She's the best server/ bartender here."}
{"text":"My friend and I just went to The District. We loved the food. Such good prices. Sam was a great waitress. She was very accommodating and friendly. We will be back here for lunch. Great music in the background playing and a good vibe."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere without the crazy crowds and noise"}
{"text":"The burgers are excellent! Rylee was our friendly and knowledgable server and we adored her! Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience . The  securtiy at the door was shockingly ignorant. We went there on a tuesday night since we had family & friends visiting from Dubai. Heard fun things. As we arrived, I got in with no problem without a state i.d but the rest of the group were not able to get in without their passports since they only had their Dubai issued id's...which was ubderstandable..company policies are different. The ignorant fool at the door had to say  \"we don't take your stupid i.d here...go back to your bottled water\" instead of politely saying \"sorry, without a state id\".. or whatsoever \"we cant let you in\".  Rude & disrepecrful people like that shouldn't be at the door. We were a group of different races & people around us that heard us were shocked. We got in other places just fine."}
{"text":"This was one the best burger joints I have ever been too. My husband and I are very well traveled and have lived in 6 different states. We went there with our three boys at around 2pm on a Friday. We ordered two cheeseburgers, two \"Harlem burgers\", ranch bacon French fries, cheese curds and 3 shakes...of which were one chocolate and 2 peanut butter flavor. The burgers were huge! Like 5-6 inches in height and 4 inches wide. They were juicy and delicious. Their cheese curds were out of this world! They are very similar to mozzarella sticks but the breading was more tempura like. The onion rings were crunchy and big with the onion part staying intact with the battered outer layer. The shakes were simply put evil because they were so tasty and perfect in the amount of thickness that you don't want to share."}
{"text":"Giving this 5 stars because the food couldn't be any better! Most juicy and tasty burgers. The shake was great. It's more like a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"A very lively place! The food was excellent, probably one of the best burgers you can find in Old Town. High quality meat and tons of flavor. I love the brioche buns, so moist! Staff was very helpful and attentive, the chef even came to say hi and check on us. Fun place! Only suggestions is the beer menu was a little blah, but happy hour prices were great."}
{"text":"Awesome milk shakes! Good burgers! Excellent sweet potatoes tots!  Cool spot to hang out with friends and feed the animal...."}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing cocktail across the street. I got good service and a couple of really goid cocktails. Really all I was looking for right now."}
{"text":"We tried the District because of a Groupon we purchased for 2 burgers, 1 side & 2 milkshakes.  We were very impressed with the choice of burgers. We had the Harlem Shake burger & the Faithfully. These burgers are huge!  Their fries are skin-on & fried well. We especially liked the homemade milkshakes.  We would recommend this restaurant for anyone that lives burgers!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and decided to try it out. Be warned, its in a very busy part of Scottsdale and its also a nightclub. Be prepared for parking 2 blocks away and long waits on Friday and Saturday nights.   Go during the week and avoid the crowds and parking hassles.   The food is fantastic! Loved the burgers! Loved the buns! Loved the fresh cut, crispy (but thick) french fries! Loved the Wisconsin Cheese Curds with marinara! Everything was really, really over-the-top delicious. The atmosphere is very cool. The staff are all very cool. The prices, even without the Groupon, are very reasonable (especially considering its location).  I will be dining here again soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun, pretty good service and the security at the front were very friendly."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. it took the bartender over 6 min to acknowledge us. She never even gave us a food menu and was on the opposite side of the bar the whole 1.5 hour we were there, when she was by us she never even looked at us. we only purchased two drinks (one each) because she never came back. The food is the only redeeming quality for this place. I really enjoyed the cheeseburger i purchased with my groupon. Good food horrible service."}
{"text":"Food-wise, 5-stars.  Service-wise, 5-stars...ish.  We tried two of their enormous burgers via a Groupon we purchased, which also included a side and two shakes. Both the Fireman burger & Californication were very tasty & filling. The side of sweet potato tots were good, as were the Chocolate Cherry and Very Berry shakes.  I like the setting. Very 'Murican, with a touch of classic American pop culture, and pretty similar in layout to the other restaurant bars lining this street. Our server was nice and bubbly too.  The only real complaint I had is that with the overabundance of food that comes in this packaged deal, we really didn't need two shakes. So we asked if we could substitute one of the shakes for a beer, which is actually $2 less on the menu, thinking it'd be an obvious \"yes\", and our server returned to inform us that regrettably the manager said, \"no\". That part turned what would've been a 5-star experience into a solid 4... I can understand if we were asking to sub for an item that actually costs more, but we were doing the opposite, and we ended up having to toss half of the shakes because it's just too much to put down in one seating."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the District. If I'm being frank I expected half assed bar food lacking originality. That was not the case for me! I came here with some new friends for a bite to eat and a few adult beverages. They have a solid selection of local breweries and a creative cocktail list. I opted for the Camelback IPA to keep it local. For food I opted for the Fireman burger. It was topped with bacon, fire roasted poblanos, jalapeños, red bell peppers, arugula, red onion, habanero jack cheese, and District sauce, cooked to order. I ordered medium rare and each topping added to the taste and didn't all blend into each other. Don't order this burger if you're on a date as it could be pretty messy but definitely worth it. I also ordered the sweet potato tots and they were so good I had to take them with me much to the dismay of my fellow dining companions who thought it was weird!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place! Fun atmosphere, service was on point, and the food was good. The boneless wings were my favorite two thumbs up!!  The only down side I would say is it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently attached to Maya so it's a great spot to grab some food after hitting the day club. I got the veggie burger with tater tots. It was really good and huge! This place might be a little loud and crowded for people not in \"partying mode\" though, so that's something to consider."}
{"text":"Be wary of this establishment.  I went to district yesterday and my friends credit card was lost by the bartender.   We kept the card open at the bar, but the bartender kept insisting that we took the credit card back.  The bill was never signed for or anything. We tried to talk to the bartenders about the situation, but they got an attitude and started throwing things around 'looking' for it.  Its not like we were wasted and being annoying drunks about the situation, we had one beer.   Finally, I asked the bartender if we could leave a phone number for when they found the credit card.   The bartender then says they are so busy that we should just call tomorrow and ask if they found the credit card after they deep clean that night.  To add to an already weird and sketchy situation, I am calling district and getting different voicemail names, I'm getting hung up on and no one has actually answered the phone.   So, I call over to Maya because they are connected.  The first man keeps me on hold for 20 minutes.  So, as I'm on hold, I say 'hello' and another man says hello back.  He then says he just got into work and had no idea that I was on hold and he would go look for the card.  Well, ten minutes go by and he just ends up hanging up. This is so ridiculous, it doesn't even seem real.  But, now I'm just convinced I'm being punk'd or this establishment is run by a bunch of thieves and con artists.  Or is just completely unorganized and no one knows how to use a phone.  I would definitely think twice about ever going here again, the service I have received has been extremely sketchy."}
{"text":"Today I tried The District for lunch. I had a pretty good experience. My boyfriend and I arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon to a completely empty restaurant. We approached the bar on the left side where the only employee was standing and told her that we were dining in. She instructed us to sit where ever we like and someone would be over. It was a very lax atmosphere. Our waitress however was very upbeat and friendly. We ordered the mudslide shakes, onion rings, my kind of town burger, and walking in memphis burger. The shakes were awesome, overindulgent and thick. The onion rings were okay, but a good sauce would have improved them quite a bit. I would recommend ordering something to go with them since it isn't provided. The my kind of town burger fell a little flat of expectations; it was a bit flavorless. I only tried a bite of the memphis burger.. it advertised a spicy BBQ sauce but instead was more sweet. Luckily there is a roll of paper towels left on the table as we needed quite a few. I enjoyed the bars decor and the numerous Tvs they had. The District seemed it would fill up at night, but business was incredibly slow for the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Located in the entertainment area. Plenty of seating. Screen tv's and music!  Stop number 1 before olftown."}
{"text":"'Tis the season for football and baseball, where Sunday, Monday and Thursday night's rule. Even better, is staying in Scottsdale just a stone throws away from Old Town and having all those fine establishments at our fingertips to choose from when we want to grab a bite and watch a game.  The District is an open and inviting place, with lots of tv's, a large bar and a djay that was spinning during the commercial breaks keeping the vibe upbeat and fun. The menu is a solid bar menu consisting of mainly shakes and buns with a few extras like cheese curds and sweet potato fries.  As far as bars go, this one is a solid A-Ok for me. Nothing I didn't like but also nothing that made us say, \" best we've been to\" just a great location with a big bar atmosphere. It will do and we will be back.  The extra star is for their delicious District julep... I heart juleps."}
{"text":"This revue is for the bar/nightclub only. The music is great for dancing - the drinks ARE NOT SO GREAT. They did not have red wine. They were not able to make a mojito. 1 bottle of scotch, 2 bottles of bourbon at the bar. Disappointing as far as cocktails. Stayed solely for the music."}
{"text":"Great place!  I loved the atmosphere, music, food women, drinks....this place has it all.   Went with a friend to see Lil Dicky perform and we had a blast, definitely haven't seen anything like that outside of Vegas.  Billy was our bartender most of the time, great dude!   I'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The best hamburger and onion rings and shake I've ever had hands down ! The service from Billie was excellent ! I highly recommend this place for lunch ! Wow!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there because it was a Packer bar and the food was pretty good. Both, the manager and executive chef, came to check on me to make sure I was ok with the sweet potato tots instead of fries. Definitely will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Two servers on a Sunday? During a Packer vs cowboy game. Incredibly slow I had to ask for a beer probably 4 times and I'm still waiting. Leaving at halftime and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to not drink or eat."}
{"text":"We arrived early hoping to beat the Saturday night crowd. No such luck as the District (and surrounding bars) were packed.   The drinks menu indicates some seasonal beers on draft, but good luck being able to ask your server. The noise level here is so bad that we resorted to communicating with the waitress by pointing on the menu and communicating with each other via texting. The beers arrived bottled, not on draft, and they were luke-warm.  I ordered the California Burger and it came piled high with fresh sliced avocado, grilled peppers, and grilled tomatoes. The fries were pretty good too. And that's all the good I can say about this entree. I shouted \"WELL-DONE\" when the waitress asked how I wanted my burger. It was pink in the middle. Good luck being able to communicate with the waitress if you aren't happy with your food. Otherwise the burger was flavorless and messy. The brioche bun was very chewy.  I had to get up and get us cutlery, condiments, and napkins off an empty table.  A security guard saw me and offered to bring some over, right after I had just gotten up. And that's another thing...security everywhere in here makes this an intimidating environment.  We had a guard stand over our table (usually with his back to us) the entire time we were here. I totally understand the need for security/bouncers in Old Town, but seriously, what did he think two guys at a patio table were going to do?   The men's bathroom was disgusting. The door was propped open so everyone in the bar could watch you do your business.  There were paper towels EVERYWHERE on the floor.   To cap the night off, a drunk lady threw a drink on me. In summary...loud atmosphere plus lackluster food and service. There are better options in Old Town."}
{"text":"Nope!  Came for food and drinks.  Waited 10 minutes before bartender even acknowledged we were there.  It was a dead Friday night at 730pm, and there was probably less than 10 people in the entire place.  Served a Moscow Mule in a cheap plastic cup that was so diluted with ginger-beer that I think they forgot the alcohol.  Ordered food and burger tasted like it was grilled on the floor - just plain nasty.  Stomach-ache followed in about 2 hours.  Crowd wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Need something to eat quick and found this little jewel just a few steps out the side door from the W Scottsdale hotel. Fantastic burger Californification style with a side of Sweet potato tater tots with a little cup of maple syrup. Yum!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Monday night. Service was slow despite us being practically the only ones there. Then they took my friends ID for alcohol, the manager stared at it across the bar from us for a full five minutes, then sent the waitress back over to say they wouldn't serve her because it has the phrase \"not for federal identification.\" This is a technicality that is easily cleared up with a cursory Google search.   After that, the server gave up on us entirely. I'm assuming she had just written off any chance at a good tip, and chose to ignore us from there on out. It took half the evening to get water refills.   Additionally, the tv screens just cycled a screen saver of bikini clad women partying on a beach or something. We hadn't been looking for a strip club or Hooters. This is highly subjective, but the atmosphere of this place is profoundly douchey.  The food is okay, but not good enough to make up the aforementioned inadequacies. It's one of five identical bars on that street. I recommend trying one of the other four."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's bachelorette party as the maid of honor. There was no one in line but a lot of ropes. I called out to the bouncer if we could duck under and it seemed to me that he indicated yes. As I did that, another bouncer essentially clocked me, pushing me back and yelling at me that I wasn't allowed to do that. I was really humiliated and it hurt. I'm a 30-year-old mother of a toddler, and it was the first bar we had gone to, so it's not like I fit the profile as someone trying to cause trouble or buck the system.  When we got in, after being manhandled, the bar was fine. It was very crowded, loud and smoky (from smoke machines, not cigarettes) but that's what you want from a bachelorette party in downtown Scottsdale, right? The drinks were good."}
{"text":"Fun fun bar! One of my fave night clubs in Old Town! And convenient how it's right across from my other fave bar, Bottled Blonde! Good music and good drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and their bottomless mimosas specials are half the price of other establishments in the area.  Kimberly our server was very attentive and gave great recommendations on food and made sure our drinks were always full.  Would recommend coming here during the day to eat and get great drinks and service."}
{"text":"Went in last night with a good friend to watch the fights and grab a beer. Two beers for $8 and no cover for the fights? We were impressed!   I left a $2 tip on the $8 tab when we left, and after checking my account this morning, they gave themselves an additional $15. Bank is going to be notified, charges disputed and reversed, and I won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"ashley was fantastic. after our cashing a Groupon I was very hesitant to come back after the bar was open and the restaurant  closed early. we forgot about our groupon for a few months. sorry Delux, ypu,ve got some major competition. I wasn't expecting to be totally blown away.  my husband was moaning a status afflicted upon him by his perfect *shake*  I got the vegetarian quinoa burger with avocado, perfectly melty cheese, perfect brioche- The roasted red peppers were better than some of those I've had in four star restaurants'   Ashley was totally on top of everything , beautiful, attentive, professional --- yet never pushy. A clear asset to the team. I'll be posting a more in depth post on my blog phoenix 24 or phx 24 in the future.   I'll certainly not hesitate in recommending this restaurant to anyone. I only hope the other staff is as accommodating as Ashley. we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a burger snob and these are Ahhhhmazing!  These burgers are huge, thick, juicy and perfectly done to your taste. And the bun - a perfectly soft brioche that melds into the burger.   They have many menu options at a great price, especially on happy hour.  And, if you like shakes (which I know doesn't help our diets) but they're loaded with the extras (brownie bites in chocolate and Nilla wafers in the Vanilla).    I can't wait to go back for more!  Hopefully, the District enters into the Burger Battle during Culinary Festival - definite winner!"}
{"text":"Sam was awesome. She totally took care of us and she's super nice. Burgers and shakes were awesome. Would totally come back to The District."}
{"text":"Bottle service here is always great. Music and lighting are on point.  My bestie and I came here for lunch and had the most amazing hamburgers ever! She ordered the Harlem Shake and I ordered the Californication. Yum!! I sat at the bar and had 8 giant flat screens in front of my face to watch the Cubs game. It was awesome.   Our server, Alyssa, was beautiful and helpful. She knew the menu well and made great recommendations.   There Happy Hour goes from 3-7pm Monday thru Friday and has great deals for drinks and food.   Fun both day and night.  District is low-key, clean, and fun."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This place is a little disjointed for lunch. We walked in and it took a little while to figure out where we were sitting and who was actually serving us. Once things got moving, though, the service was amazing! The food was okay, nothing extraordinary. I will say, if you are down with the cherry and chocolate thing, try their chocolate covered cherry shake. It's heavenly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in last Saturday for lunch and we had great experience here! Kassie was our server and she made sure our drinks were never empty and our food was delivered surprisingly fast. Our great experience didn't stop there... Kassie talked us into coming back for bottle service that night and we had a blast! We will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place to unwind and have a great burger and beer. Ask for Candace, she'll st you up good."}
{"text":"Place SUCKS. Food is horrible, service is ridiculously slow and the waiters are arrogant. Wouldn't waste another dollar at this HORRIBLE place. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how this place was run.  A business partner of mine wanted to have a night on the town with bottle service in a reasonably casual venue, and I recommended The District.  What an embarrassment that was.  He booked the table about 4 or 5PM on Saturday, May 4th, for that night.  When I showed up around 10:30PM, he had already arrived and bought a bottle. At the door, I told the bald, white bouncer (who later refused to give me his name) the last name of my Partner who had the table that I, and my two female guests, were there to join (we were the first guests to arrive to join the table, aside from my Partner and his friend from out of town).  This bouncer confirmed the last name was on the table list, and then just stood there.  I asked what we were waiting for?  He said the person who had the table had to come to the front to retrieve us.  I asked if he was serious.. I couldn't believe he expected the client himself, who was there spending more than 15 GA patrons combined for the 'VIP' experience, to push through the crowd and come personally retrieve each of their guests, while the hostess (who's job is to host) stood by idle.  He didn't even offer to have the hostess or a waitress retrieve my partner, he said I should text him.  In disbelief, I complied, and as my Partner pushed through the crowd from the table to the front, I asked the bouncer if this was protocol for the District and if so, why this was?  He gave me a rude answer along the lines of \"Because I said so, that's how we do it here.\"  I used to work in a high end Old Town club.  I've lived here for nearly 5 years and Old Town has been my usual weekend spot from day 1.  I am no stranger to VIP bottle service from Scottsdale to LA to Vegas and beyond.  I have NEVER seen a table client treated like this.  Whatever, I let it go, I was there to have a good time.  About an hour later two more guests of ours arrived, one male one female.  They texted me asking us to come retrieve them in the same fashion.  Already feeling embarrassed by having recommended this place and having my partner treated like that, I personally pushed through the crowd to the front to get our guests in.  I walked outside where our guests were standing on the other side of the stanchion.  When the same bald white bouncer finished checking IDs for a group, I approached him and let him know those two were our guests for the same table.  He looked at me blankly in a patronizing tone said \"Oh ok!\"  And then he stood there, and again, did nothing.  I asked him why he wasn't letting them in?  He said \"The person who's table it is has to come retrieve them.\"  I couldn't believe it.  The stupidity had me at a loss.  My face must have been red with embarrassment when I pushed my way through the crowd back to the table a couple minutes later and told my partner, \"Hey man, they want you to go up there again.\"  He was irritated, and reluctantly went back to the front and got our guests in.  It was about 11:30 at this point.  And we had a large group on their way at this point.  We weren't going to be treated that way all night, so we closed our tab and went elsewhere.  On the way out, I asked the bald bouncer for his name, intending to report him to the GM. As a business owner myself, I thought, I would CERTAINLY want to know if an employee of mine was throwing basic manners to the wind and undermining my key revenue source.  He refused to give me his name.  I couldn't believe this whole experience, and I have to assume I am not the only one to have been treated this way, as none of the support staff working the door seemed to feel that anything unusual was occurring while witnessing all this.  Before leaving, I asked our waitress why they were acting like that?  She said \"Its so a bunch of people don't come in claiming they're with a table.\"  Okay - if that's the purpose, there are MUCH better solutions to that problem than abandoning the fundamentals of the VIP experience being consciously over-paid for, especially when there are six competitors within a 200 foot radius.    I feel embarrassed on behalf of the ownership and management.  What a senseless way to lose revenue.  If this was in fact a policy passed down from management, and not a rogue door-guy with ill-intentions for his employer, then what in the actual ?  Let's see... the more guests a table has: the more bottles of high-margin liquor they're going to have to buy... the more poppin your club looks = the more exclusive it feels... more exclusive = even more patrons buying drinks & higher prices... not to mention, the service you're selling is literally represented as VIP bottle service.  What kind of \"VIP\" wants to push through your GA crowd to retrieve their own guests?   Needless to say, after that offensive treatment and embarrassing personal experience, I will *never* again, under any circumstances, be recommending the District to any of my partners, associates, investors or friends."}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch and happy hour.  It gets too busy for my liking in the evening.  Best burgers in Phoenix, and the milk shakes are incredible.  Cannot forget to mention bartender Courtney.  She always greets me by name and remembers what I like to eat and drink.  She also knows what teams I like to watch and will put their game on when I arrive without being asked.  Also extremely entertaining to talk to.  She is like that with other patrons as well.  Just a fun place for people watching, watching your favorite teams, or enjoying a good meal."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for lunch, placed our order then waited and waited and waited finally about 45 minutes later received our burgers, our waitress (didn't get her name so loud in there) was so busy chewing a big wad of green gum came by and said was it worth the wait? Heck no! what do you think? I've had much better burgers elsewhere and the onion rings were soggy so not on my list of places to return to, oh and the smoke from everyone outside flows right inside, not what I want to breathe while i'm eating!!"}
{"text":"Came in to District to catch game 2 of the NBA finals. I was greeted warmly by Kelsey and given an wide array of menu/drink suggestions. I ended with a pint of the Camelback IPA and since I wasn't too hungry, some bacon ranch French fries. The beer was served in a frosty glass and the fries came out crispy and well dressed. Kelsey was attentive to my every need and tempted me with one of their specialty milkshakes, but unfortunately I was too full. Manager with the dark curly hightop also swung by to see how I was doing, we got into a great discussion about the game. Can't remember his name but good guy. District, you have a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for a lunch had a few burgers and shakes and some of those sweet potato tater tots. Overall a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Came here to catch some Saturday NCAAF games. It was pretty amazing that the staff was willing to change the game channels by customer request. We sat at the bar and every bartender we came across were friendly and extremely efficient. We ordered a slew of burgers and shakes and everything was delish! I am the biggest carnivore but decided on the jungle and it was sooo good! Everyone else ordered a real burger and enjoyed it too. Oh and for the sides, go for the sweet potato tater tots!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. They have better deals at happy hour than buying a Groupon. Cool design on the decor. Loved the big ball made of sprockets with lights. Service was ok but they made it up on the tab. The shakes are the bomb and portions were perfect. People/Staff were exceptionally friendly!"}
{"text":"This place will never disappoint. Great food, great drinks. And our server Kimberly is a rockstar."}
{"text":"The food is terrible, burger had no season and same for the fries. Best to only come nighttime for the party I guess"}
{"text":"*** This rating is based solely on the nightclub...didn't get a chance to try any of the food***  Came in late Saturday/early Sunday with a bachelor party group, and the place was going off! Everyone having a good time, great music from the DJ, and just a good overall vibe. Didn't have to wait hardly at all in line, but by the time we left around midnight, the line was about 50-75 people deep.  Will definitely make it down here again next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night. Not only did my phone get stolen, but two of my friends phones got stolen as well. It is unbelievable that The District allows this behavior and offers no help to those whom this happens to. Security only seems to offer their services when they don't like what you're wearing or when you drink a little too much.  Also, drinks are overpriced and bartenders are unprofessional.."}
{"text":"Our first visit was no fluke, this place is great!  We brought the kids (again) on a Sunday for lunch thinking it would not be very busy but there were already several tables full when we arrived.  By the time we left it was pretty busy and music was pumping.  We were seated just after a party of 16, my wife and I thought that would mean it would take a long time to get served but Holly was on it!  She acknowledged us as she was putting in the order for the big party then got our order in.  Despite the big group keeping her busy with multiple add on orders and drink refills she kept checking in with us.  The kitchen seemed un-phased by all the orders and the food came out much faster than we thought it would,  Once again, burgers done just right, sides very good and those great shakes.  The manager John even remembered us from our last visit a month ago, I guess being here with kids makes you stand out.  Once again he was conscientious and welcoming, he even turned the music down a bit for us and gave the kids a couple beach balls.  For a place that is really for adults they do a good job making sure we didn't feel out of place.  This place really shines, even in ways you don't expect.  I mean, it is a night-spot but the food is very good and the management and staff made sure we and our kids felt welcome.  A great surprise in old town!"}
{"text":"The Best burgers and food ever, girls are great and so is the service, music is loud, and this is NOT A Place to bring kids or babies, This is for adults, they make great ice cream Drinks"}
{"text":"Only place that let me in cause I had camo shorts . service was fast and the did not lose my card"}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch and it was great! No wait, good service, great food. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I got the faithfully and added bacon and chipotle mayo. Seriously the best burger I've ever had and I'm not really a burger person. Also got a chocolate shake and onion rings and they were great. Go there hungry for sure! I could barely finish half my meal. Used a groupon so we definitely got our money's worth!! Will go back. However, good luck finding parking."}
{"text":"I wanted to try The District sourly because I had a Groupon. I was very pleasantly surprised with the location. I love it. There are so many cool places here. The burger was good served on a butcher block. Rings were good but could have been cooked a tad more. The shake was good as well. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"The Harlem Shake burger was outstanding. I was still talking about it to my wife the next morning. She was a little annoyed, but that's just how good it was. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great energy Great Vibes!  House music tuesday is the place to be.  you just might meet one of your fav local djs dropping some killer dance beats."}
{"text":"Please don't patronize this place. They are super racist. My brother and his best friend were wearing the same shoes and because his friend was African American they didn't let him in.  It is awful that they can arbitrarily pick and choose who they let in."}
{"text":"Where do I begin....I'm not one to complain.  Our server was great!  She was called in on a short-handed day, as I was told.  One server, 3 bartenders, 1 bar back.   One of the bartenders was the manager.   We waited for drinks while the manager was texting and one of the bartenders was dancing.   The bar was not busy, and we had to wait for drinks.   My friend and I complained to the manager.  His response was that they were short-staffed and if we sat at the bar, we would've received faster service.  Then we were told if we had ordered food, we would've received faster service.   All f'ing nonsense! I was told we could leave if we weren't getting proper service.  I was willing to stay if i didn't here that a few times.  We had already been waiting for food and drinks.   The 'manager'tried to blame our server for the poor service.   All B.S!  Long story short,  we were basically asked to leave if we didn't like the service.  I asked to be comped, and we were told to leave again.   I had some curse words with the incompetent manager and bartender ( C U Next Tuesday) and walked out.  WORST SERVICE EVER IN MY LIFE!!! Came to El Hefe and my party was treated like royalty.   AVOID THE DISTRICT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  ZERO stars in my mind.  I start my tip at 40% and it goes down from there.  Shay at El Hefe is has earned 50%,and Mike, the manager has earned my business!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and we loved it . Defiantly going to come back and bring more people with us. Burgers were delicious and huge. Sides amazing . Shakes was little bit more then ok. I didn't like my choice of Shake ."}
{"text":"This place is going to take the crowd away from some of the other popular bars in the Scottsdale Entertainment District.   I went here thinking it would be a lowkey night with a sports bar atmosphere but i was pleasantly surprised.  The place quickly filled up and the crowd proceeded to get turnt to the level of bottled blonde or hi-fi.   You can get bottle service at one of their tables or do the scottsdale 30,000 dollar millionaire thing and settle for their $5 domestic drafts all night.  This place passes the test for a fun night out with friends. The plethora of tvs they have also make it somewhere for you to watch sports all day long, especially with their $15 bottomless mimosas on saturday and sunday.   Very excited about this place, looking forward to many more good experiences here."}
{"text":"My friend ordered an iced tea. It looked funky... come to find out my friend was drinking someone's used Tobacco dip spit. Our server replaced the cup and continued serving. Speaking of the service, it was horrible. Our server disappeared for 30 minutes at a time. We received the bill an hour later in which we were still charged for the contaminated iced tea. I physically got up to search for a manager that we could speak to. In any other restaurant, the manager would have been at our table right away. Awful service, dirty dishes and average food. Don't go here unless you're blacked out drunk and unable to notice."}
{"text":"Great bar/restaurant for burgers and shakes!!  The veggie burger and the Californication both are winners..  The District Mud shake is my favorite shake here.   The food here is a bit pricey, but they have big portions..  We had a groupon for 4 that came with 4 shakes, 4 burgers, and 2 sides..  The sweet potatoes tots and onions rings were our sides we picked.   Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Talk about awesome service and awesome food! And being a U Of MN alumni I found out it's a gopher football bar!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now for night on the town. Service at the bar is always fast and what I love most is the music. Sat nights the DJ does a great mix of old school beats, hip hop and EDM. It's nice to have some variety and not hear the same EDM ALL the time!"}
{"text":"Came here for there bottomless deal with a couple friends. Definitely not the same vibe as some of the other bottomless spots... Snobby bartenders and staff and that's to be expected. I would come back during the night time but brunch wasn't as fun and laid back as my other favorite spot. My friends and I agreed it was nice attempt but not very original plus we spend our second half of Sunday-funday in this part of town we'll wait for the PM for this place."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Terrible customer service, cannot answer the phone (or their customers in general), staff is untrained and unable to address basic customer needs. I'm astonished at how this establishment is still in business. I'll never return and I'll advise my friends and family the same."}
{"text":"I mean my friend and I came in on a Tuesday & this guys service was less than basic. I gave him 2 stars because he kinda cute. he didn't serve us right away & Made it seem like an inconvenience to split a tab. Eh, probably won't be coming back here unless I'm blacked out."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I've only been here during happy hour for the $5 burgers, $4 shakes and $3 sides. Crazy. Not what you would expect in Scottsdale but the food is really good. The burgers are cooked to order which they do an o.k. job at. I would order the burger one level rarer than you normally do just in case they over cook it which they've done consistently. No big deal really because just about every place over cooks burgers. (not sure why grill cooks like hockey pucks but whatever). The burgers are huge, stacked with whatever options the particular burger comes with. Juicy, messy and tasty. The way a good burger should be. The sides are also good and $3 for the stack of onion rings is fair. There are 2 different Milkshakes and both are quite tasty. If you're in this area and it's happy hour time, check it out."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it gets better and better. I have now tried ever burger and I can say they all rock my world! We normally always get the \"walking in Memphis\"or the \"California\" burger, both of witch are so f***ing good! Today we tried the Harlem Shake and the firman burgers! Both are delicious and every thing you want from a good burger, flavorful, cooked to perfection, real Angus beef, quality ingredients, home made sauces, served hot and fresh! We normally get the hand down favorite sweet potato tots (best in the west) or the tasty basket of fries but decided to try the onion rings today. They were yummy but defiantly the tots take the crown in our opinion. Not to mention the shakes! The district mud is a must try, a real premium shake with actual chunks of brownie and Oreo goodness. However it's also important to have good serves which today like always we did! Sierra the bartender killed it today! Not only could we tell that she knew what she was doing with her fast and flawless serves she also was very welcoming and friendly! Everyone who works there is always very bubbly and nice! Love the vibe of this place! It's lively, clean, fun, and modern."}
{"text":"What's not to like looking at all the fresh meat that comes in every year I love it I get older and they still stay the same all hail old town Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Amazing food and Ashley was a great waitress. The burgers are mouth watering. The kids loved it too :) great atmosphere !!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar! Fun, fun, fun. I was there on weekday which they had a band. The place was pack and they were able to still have great service. The good looking staff are professionals and nice. Everyone there were cool. Don't miss this place when you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I was in Scotsdale. It's hip and happening. The bartenders are real cool and easy to chat with. Prices are good."}
{"text":"2nd time there.  First time it was totally empty save the bartender and us and then about half way through-a dad w/ 2 kids came in w/ the same groupon we were using.  Take note, service was good, food was good but it is mainly a night clubby/bar atmosphere.  The first time we went w/ the groupon for 2.  This time, we used the groupon for 4 and went w/ our son, daughter and the 2 younger grandkids.  It's very loud-yet I would never suggest going w/ a crowd b/c they don't have tables for more than about 6 (if you squeeze).  It is more of a bar, late night place/area.  So if you want to go for a family burger night, either go very early or go someplace else."}
{"text":"After waiting for facking ever at the oh so busy casa amigos old town with Zero service with the whole 10'people there... we came and actually had the most prompt service with Kristy at the bartop at the district!! She was super awesome and I've been in this industry for too long!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in the Valley so far. Sat down at the bar and was promptly treated to service and taken care of. I had the \"Walking in Memphis\" and this Tennessean gives it approval. Tender, juicy and even comes with a side of fresh fries which were also great. Security at this place was pleasant, instead of being rude, the bouncer was kind when letting me know that food had to stay inside and can't be brought to the pool. I would definitely return to this spot for a burger and a drink. Great service!"}
{"text":"First, the decor is absolutely fabulous and fun--an eye feast.  Our server was friendly, but it took FOREVER to get our food with apps being served simultaneously with the burgers. (There was literally only 1 other table seated in the place, so it wasn't busy.) We mentioned to our server that it was 97 degrees outside so with their doors open and absolutely zero a/c or even a fan blowing, it was extremely uncomfortable. He just chuckled and agreed that it's hot today!  The burgers were huge. The buns were a little stale and hard, but the toppings were good. Our sides/apps (onion rings, cheese curds, skin-on fries, and sweet potato tots) were good--typical bar food. Our shakes were 1/3 whipped cream on top.  If I didn't have the Groupon which made this an incredible deal, I wouldn't go back and pay the menu price for what we got."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here, we all tried out their burgers and shakes, seriously tho they have amazing burgers. I had the veggie burger and it's probably the most amazing veggie burger I've had so far.  John the kitchen manager came out and talked to us and passed down some recommendations. The staff was so friendly and on top of everything. We are coming back for sure. My 4 year old had a blast as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I waited for 20 minutes with no acknowledgement.  Asked the bartender for a menu, waited another 5 minutes he never brought us the menu so we decided to leave.  Horrible service, we will never go back."}
{"text":"Was in town for work stopped in and had an awesome lunch!  Best hamburger I've had in a awhile.  Service was great too, the bartender Christian was very friendly and helpful when I couldn't decide on which drink to get.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is shit. Don't plan on ever coming back to this place. To the man checking ID's on the weekend, it's 2016... Discrimination isn't cool."}
