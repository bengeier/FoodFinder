{"text":"Great little place to have great tasting Asian food at a good price. Menu has a predominately Japanese flavour. Dragon rolls are excellent. Service is quick and friendly. Lunch specials are great value. Location is off the beaten path and parking is a challenge. Worth the try."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this restaurant often. Some thing has changed, and we will no longer be returning.  My family and I ate there 3 wks ago and the seaweed salad was frozen.  The butter fish was frozen as was the tuna. They didn't bring the entire meal that we ordered ( we always take a picture of the All you can eat list that we check off, just to be sure that the aforementioned won't happen) and when we complained we were told that's the way it is.  The quality has dropped to sub-par and there was no compensation even offered. Bye bye Edamame!"}
{"text":"We both had 'roll combos' which included about 15 pieces of sushi, salad and soup.  His combo was for veggie lovers and mine was the spicy salmon, butterfish and tuna...delicious!  My only concern is that I don't know what butterfish is.  The menu prices were reasonable and the service was efficient.  The decor was simple.  It included a string of white Japanese lanterns overhead which lightly swayed."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the better Japanese style places in North York. Their rolls are the absolute best and are very filling, granted that's all that I've had from here along with the miso soup. Overall, you get what you pay for. I order from here every chance I get and prefer this place to Rainbow Sushi, Yonge Sushi, etc."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi places in the area. Good salmon, decent price, quick service, filling."}
