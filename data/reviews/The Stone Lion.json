{"text":"the patio is really great in the summer. I don't have a reason for going here in winter though. I ordered some jerk chicken thing, and pieces of rubber were in it. the server apologized and took it off the menu. other than the pieces of nasty plastic, the chicken was meh.  then I saw a drunk man stumble out of the restaurant and get in his car and whip down queen street.  what a delightful meal."}
{"text":"Went for Trivia Night with some friends while visiting Toronto. Fun and friendly host, the quesadillas were yummy, the beer was good, plus we won a $25 gift certificate. I wish they had a longer craft beer list, but other than that, I really enjoyed this pub and would happily go back."}
{"text":"This is fractionally above a tourist trap.  It's fine for drinks though the service is a little lame with waitstaff foregoing eye contact to spend our brief interaction glued to their iPad ordering system.  The patio is what keeps this place going - that and how few competitors there are In the area.   The food Is pretty terrible.  The 'baked chicken and feta' sandwich had to be microwaved and was the possibly the most dried out chicken I've had in a pub.  French fries are extra with sandwich entrees and were mostly stuck together but they were warm and tasted fine.  The fish tacos were pretty weak and soggy.   It really wouldn't take much to turn around the kitchen but I don't think they really care.  Gosh darn My Place In The Beach not being open before 4pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Ein guter Ort um ein schönes Bier  zu trinken und typisches Barfood zu bekommen. 
Bierauswahl ist echt großartig und es gibt sogar ein Alkoholfreies! Pro Tag gibt es ein besonders im Angebot. 
Neben der üblichen Speisekarte gibt es auch eine Tageskarte. Vegetarier finden auch etwas zu essen. Ich hatte den Quinoa Salat mit Ofen-Rote-Beete von der Tageskarte, dazu eine kleine Portionen  Süßkartoffeln. Diese wurden mit einer scharfen Majonäse serviert, die mich - genau so wie der Salat - echt vom Hocker gerissen haben, weil es so lecker war. 
Service aufmerksam und echt freundlich. Essen wurde zügig serviert. 
Draußen ein großer Patio. Drinnen Livemusik. Dort wäre es mir deutlich zu laut gewesen. Das wäre der einzige Minuspunkt. 
WLAN funktioniert draußen nicht."}
{"text":"Great lunch - wrap and chili was so good. 

Chili on potato pancake, just wow!

Hot and fresh. 

Patio is one of the best in the beach. 

Beers were amazing. Love cruiser on tap!"}
{"text":"dish 1: fish and chips. fish crust was too dry and rough, very dark colour giving the impression that the oil was old or reused. too few fish inside the crisp. the fries = too oily. 

ketchup bottle mixed with water so when i opened the ketchup bottle, it spilled all over the table and on my jacket. the waitress did see us struggling, as we ordered extra napkins, and didn't consider/suggest/seem to care helping us (in any way). an obviously bored young girl who hides behind the bar. she looked at our table and the ketchup-full-napkins we used and said: 'oh extra napkins for that!' and left. she got us napkins but that's all.

dish 2: pad thai chicken. It was extra!!! spicy!!!, eyes in tears from how spicy it was. burnt onion and mostly burnt ingredients (posting images). seems like this dish was forgotten by the chef. 

Ambience: the place was over heated. warm air coming out of the ceiling on our heads (adding the spice and the ketchup smell everywhere on the table, wasn't nice lunch). 

place was not busy except for 2 other tables and happy people at the bar. so no excuse for bad food."}
{"text":"Four of us were there for dinner on a Tuesday night. Nachos: mediocre.  Wings: for me, inedible (not cooked enough, gamey tasting), french fries: delicious!!, fish tacos: average.  Ambience is very noisy. The restaurant is laid out in a way that there's nothing to buffer the noise so a comfortable conversation cannot be had.  Only great thing: $20 bottles of wine on Tuesday night. I would never go back for the food but may consider going on a Tuesday evening to share a bottle of inexpensive wine with a friend (but would only go if the weather was good and could sit on the patio outside)."}
{"text":"Sigh. Why is it so hard to find a decent place to eat in the Beach? Here's yet another pub. They all seem to be owned by the same company, they all serve the same food. Calamari! Really! Just like the place next door and the one across the street and the one just down from that. Hey, with chipotle aioli -- just like everywhere else in Toronto. Etc.

The battered fish was disgusting -- thick, soggy, inedible batter around dried-out tasteless fish. So-called creamy slaw was chewy and flavorless and far, from from creamy. Accompanying fries were soggy. Thank goodness for ketchup! Korean short ribs were overly sweet and gristly. For some strange reason, I expect to see some meat when I order ribs.

With the hard furniture and bare wood floors and echoey walls, it isn't exactly a comfortable place to sit back and relax -- feels like a glorified fast-food joint. But they have some decent beers, which is about all they have that's worth returning for. Eat at home first, go and enjoy the beer."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a late lunch with my gf. I knew the food was mediocre and overpriced because I've had the displeasure of eating here before-- but we figured it would be quick and easy. We were wrong-- the service was the absolute worst. I don't know who they have working in the kitchen, but they must not have a clue what they're doing. We waited 15 minutes before being greeted by a server and offered drinks and our menus. We waited another 20 mins before getting our drinks and had to stop the server from rushing away so we could order food. My gf ordered chicken fingers w/fries and I ordered a burger-- couldn't get any easier, right? Lol, apparently deep frying some shitty frozen chicken fingers and heating up a frozen burger was too much for their incompetent kitchen staff to handle. After another 30 minutes sitting with empty glasses our server finally came back...but still no food. We got another drink and asked how long the food would take as we had other things to do-- the server said she'd get it rushed out to us and it would be about 10 minutes. After waiting 20 more minutes without food or an update, we decided to say fuck it and go elsewhere. As we were paying at the bar, because we couldn't even flag our server *again*, she comes out with the food. I told her we were out of time and we didn't want it. She took it back to the kitchen and I see the angry joke of a \"cook\" making a fuss. It's like, bro, if you could cook the fucking food in 10 mins on the fly, why the fuck did it take you over an hour to make it?! The place was HALF full! You're not fucking busy! 

Paid, didn't tip. Won't come back. The owners should have a hard look at how the place operates--I would fire half of the staff. The only guy that was sympathetic and apologetic was the bartender. 

Oh, the local drunk sitting at the bar even made a stab at the incompetent kitchen staff and how long food takes to get! What a joke!"}
{"text":"Since turning into the stone lion the service here has been great. Very large patios."}
{"text":"The team at the Stone Lion always kills it!

Food is top notch & changes with the seasons. Service is great and the patio is amazing. Sean always makes sure we have a great time.

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars here just for amazing patio. If you want good food, then maybe it's not the place to go. Been here with my kids last week. Kids asked for cheese pizza from the kids menu. I had fish and chips. Pizza was just inedible. My hungry kids could eat it. My fish and chips plate was missing coleslaw. Then I've asked about it I was informed that they run out (it was before 6p.m.) Eh? Fries were weird and fish covered on huge crust. Overall not nice experience. I understand that kitchen can run out of something, but aren't they supposed to notify the customer and offer something instead nicely?"}
{"text":"A good spot to grab some drinks and chill! There was live entertainment, the singer was good, good voice!  We just grabbed drinks but no food! Can't complain about the service!"}
{"text":"The Stone Lion is a corner stone of the Beach Community. No pun intended.   What makes it a nice place to hang out is the layout; a patio on the east and west side with  the bar in the 
Middle. 

The staff are friendly and very polite. The selection of draught beer is extensive with over 20 to select from, so it's safe to say they can cover you taste in beer. 

However, the best think about the Lion is by far those that regularly hangout there. If you want to get a good feel of the Beach Community then the folk that frequent the Lion are a great indicator. 

If you can't make a friend here at the Stone Lion then you were not meant to have any. 

The Stone Lion is a place to chill, laugh at life and meet new friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really good. Staff friendly. The soup is homemade and always delicious. A simple burger is a delightful surprise. 
The Blue Jays Burger \"made with hope \" lol. 
An authentic local pub and eatery. Watch the game or chat with the regulars. You'll be glad you came."}
{"text":"We tried the new Stone Lion. As noted previously, the old place was a bit dingy but good for a beer on the patio.

However, we were not impressed at all on our first visit. Firstly, the menu is extremely limited. There is nothing good here for a vegetarian (1/2 our family). It has one of the smallest menus for a pub i've ever seen. the burger was OK but you pay extra for fries, so overall it is overpriced.

The patio furniture is the cheapest crappy plastic chair (unbelievably, more cheap than the old Lion's home depot patio furniture. The inside reno is at least clean, but pretty boring, blah and nothing to make you want to come back. Pretty cheap looking reno overall. 

Service was OK. Our server tried hard, but they couldn't get our order to the table at the same time. One of the dishes was late coming and they forgot one of the sides.

Not even sure why I don't give it one star. I'll save the for Bikkuri Sushi (worst service in the beach BY FAR).

Big disapointment."}
{"text":"Soooo bad. I went with my kids a couple days ago for dinner. I ordered a beer and the kids ordered a Pad Thai and some chicken wings. Both were inedible. Worst Pad Thai I've ever eaten. It was like Chef Boyardee Pad Thai, like it came out of a can. The waitress asked me \"be specific, what exactly could the chef do to improve it?\" I said, \"for starters, the chef could go to a restaurant that serves Pad Thai and eat it.\" And the wings were slimy and tasted of corn starch. However, the beer was good. They poured a good beer. Highly recommend the beer."}
{"text":"Good place to eat when you are hungry. They have big portions, mainly comfort foods, nice patio and good waitresses."}
{"text":"Update:  Refer the the recent rating vs the ones from early 2015 when ownership had just changed. Everything  about this place has improved dramatically since the initial reviews."}
{"text":"This is somewhere you don't want to try ordering from. I could probably use this over fried fish as a weapon. that's how hard it was."}
{"text":"My salad was good - my friend's salad had a hair in it. Upon noticing this, we waited for our server to come by so we could tell her. Our server, Kailey (same name as me... ironic), had a rather rude response to our discovery: \"Okay, what do you want me to do? You've already eaten most of it, right?\" ....
My friend and I are both servers, so we understand these things happen. But we also know how to deal with customer situations like this in an appropriate manner. Kailey's response baffled us! We looked blankly at each other, surprised at her blatant disrespect. She then offered to take the food away, which she did. When she returned after 5 minutes later, she had told us the manager gave my friend a 10% discount on her bill, which was less than a dollar off. Insulting. The manager did not even drop by our table to do damage control like responsible establishments do. 

Update: this friend of mine emailed the establishment over 2 weeks ago, having received no reply back. Safe to say, we are NEVER returning back here."}
{"text":"Had the nachos here which were average. The patio is very small (only seats 4-6 people) which overlooks Queen St. E. The inside is dark (it is a bar) and has seating both at the bar and tables. The beer selection is decent."}
{"text":"The sign out front got us. \"Local, fresh and friendly.\" By definition, yes, if you are standing there it's local because you are physically nearby, but fried frozen chicken tenders doesn't exactly jive with local flavors or fresh. The outdoor seating area was nice and the staff was fine. It was really the food (and the prices for said food) that was a complete disappointment. My boyfriend got crab cakes and onion rings. The crab in the crab cakes was LITERALLY artificial crab. We couldn't believe it. Wtf? The onion rings were way greasy (translucent and dripping in oil). My kale salad had almost an entire bottle of poppyseed dressing on it. More like poppyseed dressing soup than a salad. Give it a shot if you must, but I'd steer clear if you're actually after any version of a decent meal."}
{"text":"Yikes, this place. 

I feel like there should be a separate rating system for restaurants in the beaches, as they all seem to be stuck in the same dull vacuum. How many \"Basic pubs\" can you fit per capita? Restaurant owners here seem to be chasing the record. 

You want chicken wings!?! You got it!!

Decent selection of mostly corporate craft beer (corporate owned breweries posing as independents). The taps are cold though and my Steamwhistle was delicious.

Twenty year old girls and Neanderthals with bad haircuts flock here like militant pigeons. If you visit after 10pm, be prepared to witness communal shots from wooden planks, drunk tarts dancing on the bar (yes, actually), awful music and drug dealers from Scarborough striking poses.

This is the kind of place where the owner is either a genuinely nice guy, with nothing but good intentions, and I'm an asshole (quite possible), or else he's barely there and hardly knows what's going on.

Apparently someone got stabbed there the other night. Sounds about right. 

Dat patio doe!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here and magical summer Wednesday night.  Sat on the patio and had beer and wings.  

Service was fast and quite cheerful.  All the staff seemed happy to be there.  Place was very clean compared to what it used to be as the Stone Lion.  Bathrooms were great.  

I think it's one of the better patios in the beaches to be honest.  

Wings were great - and Wednesday night they are on special for $7!  Total deal.

We will definitely be back, and I will bring my friends.  I'm excited to have a place in the beach that I can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely atmosphere. They need to make their own burgers and crisp up the fries to improve the experience."}
{"text":"Honestly the food sucks and the service was meh. The only thing remotely enjoyable about this place was the nice patio. The burger and onion rings were of the frozen variety and had absolutely no flavour.  I ordered the baked chicken sandwich with a side of salad. The salad was wilted and lacked any depth / flavour. The chicken was dry. I cannot believe we dropped 70$ on this crappy meal. This was your 2nd chance Stone Lion. We're done!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight, fish and chips, among the best we ever had. The service was fast and friendly.  The portion size huge. The taste superb.  The fish was crispy, and the French fries were home chipped and fried to perfection.  
The patio is very nice, away from street noise, and quaint. 
Overall a great eatery."}
{"text":"It is no longer Lion On The Beach, it's a new restaurant in the same spot now called Stone Lion.  Completely renovated and brand new.  I live the area and pretty much stayed away from the old place as it was pretty dingy and unkempt.  I got the feeling the old establishment was satisfied to do the minimum and just coast.  The new place is very clean and inviting and it's obvious that ownership and the staff want the place to be a big success.  You can feel the entrepreneurial energy of everyone wanting things to be perfect - pretty nice to see.

I guess you would classify the Stone Lion as a gastro-pub because there appears to be a real focus on chef style food.  The beer prices are OK at $6 and change for a craft pint and the food is very reasonable based upon what you get.  One note is that they don't take Amex at this time, which is unfortunate.

So far I am very pleased and I hope Stone Lion is successful.  Nice to see independent new businesses in the beach who are working hard to add to our community experience.  Maybe there is hope for Queen East yet as it is turning into a non-stop row of McCondo's and franchise restaurants."}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at the Stone Lion this evening.  It was the Lion on the Beach for about 30 years and changed owners and was renovated about 2.5 months ago.

Gord ordered lobster mac & cheese with bacon.  He said it was just okay.

I ordered smoked jerk ribs and fries.  The ribs were tender and the sauce had a kick to it.

Gabby was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"I went veg this time and ordered a couple of things on the menu that were all veggie.  I'm not a vegetarian but if I was I'd go here all the time!

Great layout and open space, good vibe- a lot of locals (which is always comforting).  Good selection of beers on tap.  

Service was attentive and wonderfully polite.  We barely noticed when our waitress clocked-out.  Good music, but it can get a bit louder as the night goes on."}
{"text":"The patio is massive and has two sides; packed with people enjoying the warm weather. Did not order food. Went for drinks; plenty to choose from. Food wise, the menu has a limited selection and is typical bar food. Inside, a Celtic band was playing live music. Good vibes and energy. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Back in February, a friend whom I went to high school with, was in town. She lives in Victoria these days. She was here for a wedding and spent her birthday here.

I am the type of person who understands that when you return home, you don't have time to see everyone that you want. Time is limited. So, I didn't reach out to her and ask if we could hang out. I normally let that person do the suggesting first, as my schedule is far more flexible.

To put our meeting in context, we have not seen each other since my last year of high school. She was a year ahead of me. I had skipped a grade in French, so we ended up in French class together for three years. She came to our high school during her reading week and we talked just outside my locker.

Time flies. She reached out to me and asked if we could do coffee. I asked if she was free on a weeknight for dinner. She was. We came to the Stone Lion, as it was walking distance for her and I was driving over to our old neighbourhood anyway.

I parked on Kenilworth. Sidestreet parking is perfect. You don't have to pay like you would on Queen Street East, depending on the time of day.

I got there early. The washrooms are downstairs. This building was a CIBC branch in the past. The basement gives you the feel that there was a bank vault.

My friend walked in. It was great seeing her. She told me that I looked the same. She hasn't aged, either.

We spent four hours chatting. It was a fun evening. Our server was patient with us.

I ordered the bacon mac and cheese. I love comfort food. So does my friend. She decided to be bold, and went with wings and fries. I washed it down with a Diet Coke.

The portions are huge here! Sadly, I wolfed down my bacon mac and cheese, and never got a photo. I will say that you get the spiral noodles, which allows more cheese to cling to each noodle. Perfect! The mac and cheese here is yummy and cheesy, the way it should be. Her wings were huge. She got a decent amount of fries and veggie sticks.

It was wonderful catching up with her. This place was a perfectly casual, cozy place to meet up with a dear friend.

{"text":"Passed by this place a few times after going to the beach, and decided to check it out. 

I was excited to try the bacon mac and cheese after seeing a couple of pictures on this site, but was disappointed when it arrived. The dish did not remotely resemble what was in the picture, which appeared to show a more creative fusilli pasta in white cheddar cheese sauce. The plain macaroni and cheddar cheese dish that actually did arrive tasted fine, but wasn't too different than what I can prepare in my own kitchen. The poutine I had on the side was also fairly mediocre. 

Given that the restaurant isn't responsible for the accuracy of pictures posted on this site, I can't really hold this against them. All that being said about the food, the server was friendly, attentive, and prompt. This place is conveniently located near the beach, and would still be a decent place to grab a drink on it's patio."}
{"text":"Loved the cauliflower bites with Kalbi sauce. Delicious beef dip sandwich. One of the best Ceasar I've drank at the restaurant. Great patio ! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Asked to sit outside on the patio but the hostess stated the patio was full, aould be a 20 minute wait but we were the only ones in line. They said we could sit inside until a table opened up. We agreed, sat for about 3 minutes and then we got a patio table. Unfortunately we sat for 10 minutes before we ordered and that was only after i approached the waitress.

We shared 3 appetizers: Korean kalbi short rib, coconut shrimp and bacon perogies. We waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive. Hence no photo of the perogies because at that point I was so hungry, I didn't care anymore.

All the food met our expectations but the service was very slow and not a place to go if you're hoping to pop in and leave quickly. Great patio, has one off the street and another behind/beside the building. We paid $10-12/app, should have just gotten a meal."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience.  My husband and I visited this place twice and each time the food, service and crowd were great. Will for sure be back; if you're vegan like me be sure to try the vegetarian burger. It's great!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Since the revovations, I can honestly say this place has stepped up its game. Not to mention; the food is considerly better than most of the pubs that you'll find on Queen Street East."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Terrible service and disgusting burger. I'm not a Crazy foodie or anything, but this place just sucked.

Don't get any of the burgers if you're forced to come here."}
{"text":"Swing and a miss.  

They could really have made this place amazing but somehow its just not quite there.  The staff aren't friendly and I suspect that I was given a dirty glass with my beer, the burger was quite lame and my friends coffee  was \"lukewarm and burned\". 

To top if off they totally failed at rebuilding the actual bar.  The top of the bar isn't deep enough for you to sit comfortable at it.  Your legs get somewhat squished or you have to sit with them to the side.  Not comfortable at all."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner and was attracted by the outdoor patios in the front and side of the restaurant. Ordered 2 appetizers; hummus and pita and perogies; and 2 entrees; the mac and cheese and a burger with sweet potato fries. Food was overpriced and mediocre. The appetizers came at the after our entrees. The table we sat at reeked of beer and we had to ask for them to wipe it down a second time. Service was good but nothing amazing. 

Overall, a good place for a quick bite or last resort outdoor patio spot. Good summer vibes with expensive food that will make you just slightly satisfied."}
{"text":"Glowing review for this place! Atmosphere is warm and welcoming. I wondered in for lunch and had the fish tacos and a big glass of the house Chardonnay. It was so good I came back for dinner! Had the ravioli- it was great! Servers were nice and I felt very relaxed. Also, prices are reasonable. Would go back anytime I'm in the area. Thank u!"}
