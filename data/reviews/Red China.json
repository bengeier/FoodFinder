{"text":"If you like food that tastes like ALPO then this is the joint for you!

I give this place a one-star review because the food was TERRIBLE and the service was AWFUL. 

I ordered Beef with Vegetables and the meat looked purple, pale and felt soft. 

The General Tso's chicken was a little bit better, what my hubby ordered, albeit I'm sure it's just as MSG-loaded and as old, if not older, than the limp beef I ate. 

The fried wontons also wafted forward with a delicate Kibbles 'N Bits aroma, with a fake gravy flavor oozing within to match."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you see a little place that is a bit rustic, maybe a little dirty, and it's the best Chinese food you've ever had?  Well, this is not that place.

I was in a rush home yesterday and needed a quick dinner.  I've passed Min's Town on my way home many times and thought maybe this would be the time to give it a try.

I am a Kung Pao Chicken devotee, no peanuts, kind of a guy.  At Min's, this item is on the specialty Szechuan menu and everything is about $10.  Sure, I thought.  Why not.

It's pretty mediocre fare.  Spicy enough, tasty enough, but just meh.  I think the chicken was par fried and then warmed up again with my order.  In place of the peanuts, I got a ton of green peppers in their place.  

Fast, friendly enough, but the food was just sub par for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"The takeout we had tonight was really below par. General Tao had a runny light brown sauce and batter was not crunchy like we like it. Similarly broccoli seemed overlooked. Veggie lomein 
 was bland and short on vegetable variety and amount... mostly noodles. Hot and sour soup was best item but didn't impress either."}
{"text":"This isn't the most flavorful Chinese I've had, but it tastes authentic and seems healthier than most others.

Made to order, authentic, tasty, and healthy. It has my vote!

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to the restaurant.  A little on the dive side, but the food is decent.  I'm partial to the shrimp mei fun, extra spicy.  It's been good and made to order every time I've had it.  The meat wontons have been good also.
No, this isn't your fancy place for Chinese, it's a small town spot in what is really, a small town.
The service has been good, food quick, and the lady friendly."}
{"text":"Recently tried Red China for some take out. They do a lot of local business judging by the traffic I observed while waiting for my Szechuan Beef. Good was delicious, hot and sour soup was excellent. Family run, very polite and eager to please. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Red China is easily one of the best chinese take-out places in the Greater Pittsburgh area. The flavor, authentic feel, and family-owned touch is what makes it. Everytime I come in, I talk to the son of the mother who owns it and he always makes pleasantly interesting conversation. I always walk-in to order versus calling on the phone (too much pressure, yeaknow?) and no matter if I order a lunch special or two dinnners, the wait is no longer than 10 minutes. The portions are HUGE. I can make a full order of lo mein and beef broccoli last a week. 

The dumplings, fried or steamed, take my palate to west coast dim sum; they are amazing. They also have to go tea, which is a nice touch and you can sit inside in eat, which is actually pleasant if you go with a few friends. 

Red China highly deserves to be lauded from every angle."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place an extra star because it doesn't deserve one star reviews. It's a family place and very friendly. 
It's not great by any stretch but it's not priced like a five star restaurant either. 
The food is the standard fare that you'd expect at any Chinese take out."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised that this place got so many decent reviews. We went there one time and it was horrible. I should've listened to my mother when she said to never go to a restaurant with dirty windows. The food was on par with the filthy windows. Even the water glasses were dirty. The food was bland and tasted like canned chow mein. I would not return here."}
{"text":"This place used to be touch and go when it was Min's Town, but it's gotten significantly better since it became Red China! The food is better, the ordering process is simpler, the overall experience is much more pleasant. Thankfully the rude male owner is now gone and the female owner seems to have full control. Anyone who had a poor experience in the past should really give this a second try."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese resturant around...

I stopped by Min's town the other night and was appaled by the filth inside and how sick (as in flu/cold) the lady at the front was."}
{"text":"*UPDATE* The review below was for the restaurant \"Mins Town\". I did notice the name change to \"Red China\". Having said that, I do not know if it is under new management or just a new name so, please, take this review with a grain of salt because this place could be under new management since my review which also means it could've improved or gotten worse. *END*

While Mins Town isn't the worst Chinese food joint around, it certainly isn't the best either. The food isn't as overly seasoned as a lot of places. It has a pretty good balance. The Sesame Chicken was the best dish they had, in my opinion. However, there are much better alternatives if you're willing to make the drive to pick up the food. Kyoshi's, on University, is a really good choice."}
{"text":"I have been to many American Chinese food places. I have been coming here for the past 12 years, and will continue to patronize... Love the owner, and the food is great, always. Nice prices and portions, that why I always come back. Food is on point. Anywhere else your paying far more and smaller portions and if your getting General tso's, which is what I get faithfully, it's usually soggy... Not this place. It may not be the most up to date looking place, but everything cost money. Keep making good affordable Chinese food!!! Thanks for the bomb food and service! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.  The restaurant itself seemed clean.  The menu was nearly identical to every other Americanized Chinese venue (not a bad thing, just an observation).  My food was prepared freshly after I ordered and the pepper steak was good.  They added carrots, which I found odd, but it worked.  Serving sizes are big enough for two meals and the prices are reasonable."}
