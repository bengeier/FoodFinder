{"text":"Small place, used to be a u-totem way back in the day.    Great atmosphere best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this place is incredibly good. I had the pollo Marconi which is basically a thin chicken breast topped with eggplant, ham, tomato, provolone and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce. Served quick and very hot, along with spaghetti marinara and hot garlic bread. What more do you need? I have a hearty appetite and couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"The food is good, service could be better.  Had a to go order which was taken by  the buser. Ordered 2 cheese steaks and wings extra crispy..told him.3x extra crispy..of course they were not so they had to make over. The food isnt cheap. 34bucks for two sandwhiches and a dozen wings.  I was charged full price even though I had to wait over 10min for wings so our sandwhiches are no longer hot.  Slightly disappointed that the manager didnt offer to take care of the wings,instead i got a to go drink..ive worked in the industry and she should have paid for the wings..dissapointed today with Time Square"}
{"text":"Interesting location, sign not lit so we almost drove past it but evidently plenty of people know about this place because it was packed on a Saturday night.  I had the pasta Emiliano good though the chicken lacked flavor, garlic bread was on point came out warm, meatballs were amazing and marinara sauce was so good (both the reason for my 4 star) service was good, just when you thought they forgot something you asked for BAM! They show up with it out of nowhere! Decor is extremely comfortable casual.  I think a hidden gem due to it's location though plenty of people have found it so they are obviously doing something right."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey it's Analynn with another great mom& pop location to try !!! Time Square at 7th street and Union Hills phoenix AZ . They have the best steak and cheese sub ! If you like Eggplant then it won't disappoint . Happy hour at the bar is a must ... offering 1. 00 beers/ drafts . Dress casual !!! As always if you go let me know what you think. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Amazing Food -  Was at the hospital when we decided to look for something new and good in the area, checked out Google maps and this one showed up.   Pulled up and hesitated to come in - building was a little weird, but we're too hungry to look for anything else.   Walked-in and people are friendly & attentive.   Food was amazingly tasty!  One of the best Italian restaurants I've been in for a few years.   Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for 10 years now and my company also used to order food from here at least once per month (extremely large orders) and I never had the experience I had here today. I don't know where to start it was that bad. Between our waitress rolling her eyes at me each time I spoke or sighing hard when I asked for something, food not being cooked the way it usually is, the manager doing nothing to help, the waitress smacking her lips when I told her it wasn't  cooked as usual and them trying to do nothing to rectify the situation than saying \"when I did come back next time I can have more sauce\". Absolutely unacceptable!!! I eat the same exact thing once per week wether it's to go or dining in. The food is always great never a complaint. The service today was atrocious and the way the manager acted was just as bad as the waitress if not worse seeing as though they are there to rectify situations. I will take my business elsewhere before I allow myself to be treated like that. I am going to do reviews in regards to this situation where I see fit"}
{"text":"My second time here. We ordered veal parmigiana and bake ziti dishes. The food was good. The waiter brought the food and says\" sorry we ran out of  bread. Is there any I can bring you. This is the first time we have ever ran out of bread\". How does a restaurant run out of bread ?????. As we are leaving the restaurant we noticed several tables with sides of bread. ARE YOU SERIOUS. Why would our waiter lie to us about having no bread. Very bizarre. It is obvious we will never go back to this establishment. Trust is an important factor in getting repeat business."}
{"text":"We heard the place was good for pasta but we order the pizza. The pizza came out cold in the middle. We sent it back and never went back. Should've ordered the pasta."}
{"text":"As always the food is fantastic. The sauces are delicious and everything is served quickly and hot. Everyone there from the bus people to the wait staff, bar tenders, and chefs is delightful and fun to be with. Thank you especially to Shay Galey for being the best waiter anyone could ask for. See you soon!"}
{"text":"The anti pasta salad is the reason we go here! It's that good. Plan to share with a friend, the portion is very generous. The staff is very friendly and there is almost a \"Cheers\" like element because it's privately owned and not some corporate franchise environment, which is great."}
{"text":"I haven't had dinner here yet but have friends who have and loved it. I have been here many times for breakfast and it's always amazing. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Time square is a great family owned spot in the northwest valley. The service is exceptional, they remember us every time we come in. The food is consistently awesome and their biscuits and gravy is the best I've found in the valley. I wouldn't have expected this to be a good breakfast spot but it's become our weekend go to. Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Came here before Thanksgiving to get some pasta and was not disappointed.   My wife is gluten free so she ordered the chicken picata with a side of spinach. I had the pasta giovanni.  Both were excellent.   The food was serve hot and fresh.  Our server named Teresa was also  very nice.  Had the bread pudding but that was just okay.  Bourbon sauce was a tad too thick and bread pudding was a bit bland.  Could use some cinnamon and fresh whipped cream."}
{"text":"Kristie is an awesome server she sees us in the parking lot and she puts in are order as she remembers what we have every sunday. The food is great just wish they would have sugar free creamer for the excellent coffee."}
{"text":"This is a perfect neighborhood restaurant, any Italian dish is made from scratch and you can taste that in every bite. So worth the wait and trip to visit. Staff is pretty amazing also, the gals know the regulars and if your new, they make you feel like your a part of the family!! I have no favorite dish, because each one taste delish!!"}
{"text":"2nd trip there.   1st time, I had chicken parm and it was pretty good.  Returned with some friends and had tried the veal parm this time.  Aside from a rude waitress, bread was stale, the veal was tough and there was not enough pasta on the plate.  I thought I had found a decent restaurant.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Start with Their seafood salad Be prepared to have the most exquisite explosion of flavors and the sweetest shrimp and tender calamari  This and its sister location are on my not to be missed Celebration  Anytime off the feast  Breakfast  Lunch Dinner Drinks Snacks"}
{"text":"23rdI'm sad to give only 3 stars because this place used to be one of my favorites for my fiance and I. My friends and god daughter who is 8 months old came to visit us over the weekend. Sunday at about 3pm we came in for a late lunch. My god daughter cried for about 5 mins while she was settling down to take a nap in her carrier. One thing to note, my god daughter does not have a loud cry, she is very quiet even when crying. Our original waitress came walking over shaking her head and then looked to the other staff members and said \"not my problem, my shifts almost over\". She didn't even introduce herself to us and just said \"so what are we drinking\". I didn't want to make a scene in the restaurant so we ordered our drinks and began looking at the menu. It was rude of her to act this way because of a baby crying for only 5 mins when the restaurant only had about 4 tables with customers. We are respectful enough to take the baby outside of she is being overly loud or if it persists for a long time also.  The rude waitress clocked out and our new waitress was phenomenal! She was kind and checked up on us, our drinks were never empty and she was just wonderful. The chefs make fantastic food that is to dir for and is great portion sizes.  I'm sad to say I will not be returning when this particular waitress is present whether children are with us or not but otherwise this place is perfection"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good food and fast service. Great food. They went out of their way to provide me with turkey instead of all the pork they serve for breakfast. Great food and very very good price."}
{"text":"I live nearby and decided to try them again with a friend. Sunday, 2 pm, only about 20 customers...but the noise from the LOUD music playing was enough to ruin the meal. Could not speak to the person across from without leaning forward to raise my voice in order to speak or to hear her. Most go to eat to enjoy the company they are with and the meal, but with the music playing so loudly, very annoying. Management needs to tone it down. Had a hot sandwich, Chicken Parmesan...most of the meal consisted of the bread roll it was on, not much chicken/or sauce/cheese for the money...not worth the $9. Have been there years ago and did not go back because it was a VERY noisy experience then with the place full..if you enjoy that chaos, then give them a try."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix. I never had a bad meal. The chef is remarkable in his preparation. One of my favorite dishes is the chipino. Crazy good on a cold day. We order the spaghetti and meatball, extra ball, on a regular basis. The antipasto salad is the best I ever had. Not much of a pizza guy so I won't comment on that since I never had one there but they come out of the kitchen like salmon swimming to spawn.   They have a bar that is conveniently placed to accommodate you with a cold beer while you wait for takeout. I've eaten at the bar a few times always a lively and friendly crowd."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the whole family!  The pest mahi-mahi is incredible because they make their own pesto!  Almost anything I've ever ordered here was amazing.  And the best ranch dressing ever!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had (and I'm Italian). The fettuccine Toscana (with chicken and artichoke hearts) is PHENOMENAL. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to give Time Square 5 stars however the noise level was horrendous!  The food is some of the best Italian food in Phoenix and I recommend giving it a try.  Be sure to visit in between meal hours otherwise to have a conversation you will need to use your outside voice!  On a recent mid-week evening, I along with 4 other diners had dinner at Time Square on Deer Valley.  Having been to the other location on Union Hills a few months ago and having a wonderful experience, we decided to try this location.  A note a caution, most portions are huge!  One of our diners order a calzone and it was large enough to feed 3 people!  The same was true for the Chef and Mediterranean Salads.  The Salad di Mare, which was my choice, was excellent and very refreshing on a hot Phoenix evening!  Our other diner order Linguini Imperial and he was too busy cleaning his plate to participate in the conversation!  An excellent Italian restaurant located in a very non-pretentious location - it looked to be a former fast food location.  Try it ... you will like it!   --Fork of Fork 'n Knife  Be sure to check out the reviews written by my critic in food, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant has been around forever, the restaurant is in a small center immediately off the road.   Food; Baked Ziti with sausage was amazing. Perfect size could be shared with small salad.    Service; everyone is always super outgoing and attentive.   Need to try spot."}
{"text":"Always the bomb. Traveled all over north America and this is some of the best Italian food I've ed ever had. Get the pasta giovanni! Get anything. Its all good. They are very busy sometimes but that's because they are awesome and the good is amazing. So if u have time to wait,  I would. Thank you times square. You make my mouth water when ever i smell your smells. And for that I also hate you,  for I know I must visit you soon and drink your scotch and eat your pasta. I love you times square."}
{"text":"I think by far the best corned beef hash breakfast in town!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I genuinely love this restaurant the service and majority of the food is amazing. (Marinara sauce is amazing best fried calamari I've had in phoenix area) the reason I give it 3 stars is because 2 staple Italian food dishes I've tried here are just plain disappointing.. the ravioli in weird butter sauce is terrible.. it's perfectly good ravioli swimming in a pool of oil slipping and sliding around making your lips greasy and filling your arteries with oil and butter.. it was horrid.. I then ordered the next time the fettuccine chicken alfredo took it to go arrived at my job to enjoy and opened a foil box of pure disappointment.. again oily noodles with hardly any alfredo sauce at all and boiled looking chicken.. looked like a microwaved dinner and tasted a bit worse. But I truly would come back here for another dish penne a la vodka linguini principessa pasta giovani pasta de Angelo all wonderful and flavorful.."}
