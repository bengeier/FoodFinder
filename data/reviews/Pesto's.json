{"text":"Went to hear the jazz being played live (thanks to jazz.kjzz.org) and ended up having a great meal too! Wonderful service. Although they were busy they found us seats right next to the band who were super smooth. Good selection of drinks. We shared a number if menu items and enjoyed everything. The kale salad was a surprising find especially for someone who doesn't normally eat kale!

We'll be back"}
{"text":"My first visit...I was not happy with being seated where dishes were emptied...close to kitchen. Aside from that My waitress was fantastic great service and wine selection. The food was served hot and freshly prepared.  There was a lot of food could not finish all of it. I will return but not sitting same table a few over would be great."}
{"text":"Pizza is just average, but the prices are well above the norm. This place is no spinatos or even nellos. Service was really poor,. The owner lady with the punk red hair (55  trying to be 15 again)  did not seem to be concerned with helping  the severs, but she was  exceptionally  loud and obnoxious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service, live music, locally owned. This is our favorite spot to dine for sure."}
{"text":"The white pizza with pesto is out of this world and the wine list is fantastic. Always great service, the waitstaff knows the wine list and makes great recommendations. We've been eating here regularly for 4 years and have never had a bad experience.  The takeout is equally as good, they never skimp on quality. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING family owned restaurant.  The food is phenomenal and the service is wonderful starting with Noah the bartender who generously let us have tastings.  We had the calamari to start with.  Tender morsels lightly battered!  The Italian Burger is to die for.  Juicy and thick patty.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Really great wine bar with very good food. Prices are a little high for some things, but the service and atmosphere are worth it."}
{"text":"Have been going Pestos for over 15 years. We order the same each time which is the baked eggplant. Keep in mind that I have never been a fan of eggplant but the way Frank makes this meal is just the most amazing dish I have ever had. I always order this  for our special occasions and it always comes out the same Amazing!!!. Best Italian restaurant in this town. I travel from old town Scottsdale to Franks place in Chandler, yes it is far for me but it is definitely worth the trip. Best food , service. Only wish they closer to me as we would come more often. Its always a treat for us. Always recommend Pestos to our clients. Never desapointed. Thank you Frank for always making our birthdays such a special occasion for us."}
{"text":"The food was great, went with me and my girl, and was blown away by the atmosphere, and style of the place. It's not over the top but it's not a hole in the wall, great place to take a first date and enjoy great food and a good environment , Alfredo Pizza was delicious, I highly recommend it to any pizza lover"}
{"text":"My partner and I had dinner here last night (10/12/12). We were very happy with the atmosphere/decor - the dim lighting helped set a romantic mood. The only seating options (for the most part) were high-top tables, which seems to deter parents from bringing their loud children. This made us very happy! High points for presentation of salads and pasta dishes. They were also delicious!! The pizza did leave a bit something to be desired. The toppings were decent, but it was more the crust that wasn't very good. It reminded us of those $1 Tostino's pizzas that we bought in college. We will go back again -  we'll just stay away from the pizza and stick with the pastas and salads."}
{"text":"Pesto's is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine, delicious pizza and great conversation! If you happen to stop in on a Saturday night they also have live music  - usually jazz."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for an enjoyable dinner. Run by Italian family who you can tell care about their restaurant. Had Ravioli and Lasagna. Great food and healthy portion. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and good wine list! The food was delicious. The grilled broccoli caesar salad and cauliflower appetizers were some of the best appetizers we've had in a long time. Even better, this restaurant is locally owned. Go for a date night or family dinner!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere. I come here all of the time for happy hour (which is fantastic, by the way) and for dinner and/or drinks. The owners are super nice and seem to really care about their customers. It's a great place to be any day of the week as a casual hangout, nice dinner, or a sweet first date."}
{"text":"Love Pestos! Wonderful family owned business with exceptional service. The pizza crust and sauce are fantastic. The low carb special is a dieting girls dream come true. Great place for date night, or to gather with friends."}
{"text":"I LOVE Pestos and me and my family have been going there since 1994!!! Frank and Debi are top notch owners. You will never be disappointed by any of their food, wine, staff or decor. My favorite is the Pizza, my husband loves the Low Carb special and my kids love the salads and calzones. ANY choice you CANT go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Place was great.  Happy hour appetizers were varied and high quality.  Loved the cosmos.  The bacon wrapped dates were yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been coming here since the place opened. Family owned with a lot of regular locals that make it kind of a \"Cheers\" sort of environment.  Food is excellent, especially the antipasto salad and cheese tray."}
{"text":"Alright, what am I reviewing here? I wish I was reviewing the decor, which is sleek and very cool. The service which was great, the wine which in this area is incomparable....but I'm not reviewing any of that, I'm reviewing the shrimp scampi pizza, and the linguini with white clam sauce, one of which gave me the rumblies in my tummy, which would not go away until I \"moved\" them out. So yes this review comes from the bowels of my hear...well no, just my bowels. You made them very unhappy. I give you 10 stars for the decor and the wine bar itself, but on the seafood, my bowels give you -9. Insert mad face here...the bowels, not me. It actually tasted pretty good going down."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wine selection! Live jazz band on Saturday and awesome ambiance. With so many wine choices I selected a Wine Flight to try 4 different wines samples (2oz each)"}
{"text":"This was my third time at Pesto's. I think the last two were pre-Yelp because we couldn't remember it well. I know I liked it the first time and my food was cold the second time. This time was the deal breaker and unfortunately we won't be back. It seems like a cute little place to have. 

My husband and I got specials of the night.  I had meat he had pasta. The meat was weird. Weird meaning it reminded me of a piece of water logged meat. It was cooked how I ordered it medium rare but it was weird and I didn't like the flavor. His pasta was seafood based and they ran out of some of the seafood. He said it was bland and the shrimp were hard (over cooked). 

It's a bummer that it was a bomb.

The service was pretty terrible too.  That was the final decision. 

Oh well.... Disappointed. I was so hungry and now my appetite is ruined for the night. Lame."}
{"text":"The stuffed mushrooms and bacon wrapped dates were amazing!  The service made us feel as though we had been coming here for years. Definitely our new go to place for amazing Italian food!"}
{"text":"This is a great family owned Italian restaurant!!! The caprese salad is one of the best I've ever had!!! Great daily dinner specials. The service is always friendly and informative."}
{"text":"This place totally surprised me. The staff was warm and friendly and the food was both unique and very fresh. The  gnocchi was excellent. They even had a kids menu although they seem to cater more toward adults."}
{"text":"I just love Pesto's.  The family owned establishment  has the best happy hour in town!  $5 wine, \"bubbles\" and appetizers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was sooooo salty that it was almost painful to eat. I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was definitely done wrong. It's been a long time since we've been here and I don't remember the eggplant being this bad the last time. I doubt we'll go here anytime soon for food, but the bar area is cozy and relaxing."}
{"text":"I......LOVE.......PESTO's

Such a cool vibe in the place. I cant help wanting to come here all the time. Great wine selection....and incredible food. I havent had anything bad on the menu. I am a huge fan of the place !!!!

The lo-carb dish was the bomb and the salads are freekin perfect every time!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner from Pesto's last night.  Was quite surprised to be so disappointed in the meal.  Previous dine-in visits and carryout from them were much better.  Let me break it down for you, we ordered by phone for carryout service as we didn't want to miss the State of the Unions speech.  Our order included The House salad, Greek Pasta, Eggplant Parmigiana and Tiramisu for desert.  Yum right!
The House salad was made with Iceberg lettuce that was still in large clumps garnished with out of the bag croutons. To its credit the lettuce was crisp and very fresh. With a name like Pesto's I expect romaine and homemade croutons.  The entrees of Eggplant Parmigiana and Greek Pasta were flat in taste, no personality at all.  They came in large portions as if to divert the lack of flavor with size, no bueno.  We counted on the desert of tiramisu to save the day.  This turned out to be tiramisu layer cake, delicious but not classic tiramisu by any stretch.  This meal cost $50, my expectations were higher and I know they can do better, I've tasted it."}
{"text":"I use to go here once or twice a week when it was a hole-in-wall pizza joint and the owner worked there everyday.  Really good pie and service. It had a perfect pizza joint atmosphere too. 

Then they got really popular, expanded, hired more help, churched the the place up and raised the prices. 

I stopped going when I had two back to back experiences with bad food and bad service. The last time I went there was for a large pie and my bill was $40. 

Now?  Costco's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, owners are personable & make you feel at home. Def. love the food MY FAV are the wings! highly recommend the atmosphere is chill."}
{"text":"After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)"}
{"text":"Go for the burger.  No, seriously.

Pizza at Pesto's was a tradition in my wife's family for years, but they eventually moved away from going regularly because the pizza is really very expensive - about $30 for a large specialty pie!   And this isn't a 24 inch one either.  

Recently we went back for dinner, but most of us ordered pasta dishes instead.  The stuffed shells were very good, as was the mushroom ravioli.  But for me the star of the evening was their Italian Burger.

This burger is a work of art.  It is easily in the top three burgers I have ever had in my life, and it certainly is the most unique.  It is a half pound burger, cooked to order, that is served on a custom roll, along with ricotta cheese, pancetta, an onion jam, and topped with arugula.  The evening I got it it came with a side of truffle fries instead of tater tots.  You know how some things in life are so much better than the sum of their parts?  This burger is one of those things.   It can be described to you, but until you experience it you really don't get it.  Pesto's should be entering this in Valley wide burger competitions - it really is that good.  

I originally felt like a bit of a rube ordering a burger when I went to an Italian restaurant, but when it was served any reservations I had quickly evaporated."}
{"text":"Their food is mediocre at best but ridiculously overpriced.
The waiter will keep interrupting your conversation which is really
annoying."}
{"text":"I went on a date here and had a really great time. The place has a really nice ambiance for a restaurant in a strip mall, and I would go here again to try out some other wines. My first and really only qualm is that they sat us at a table for 8 (there were only two of us) and then sat another group of 4 at the other end of the table... I didn't really like this and it kinda cut down on the privacy of the date... I would have gladly waited 10 minutes for another table. 

The waiter was really attentive and suggested good things. 

We both ordered two different white wines suggested by the waiter and they both turned out very nicely.

We got the garlic pesto bread with mozzarella which we both really liked. 

I got the stuffed spinach shells and he got the chicken calzon. Both were very good, the spinach was strong so I would only suggest for those who really like spinach. The portions were a good size not but too big so it would be easy to finish your plate and a small appetizer if your not super hungry. 

I'll come back for sure and try some other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"The very best Italian food in chandler! The bar is a great place too.
The hostess, Vicki is exceptional in making new people feel welcome..... She is the best in the south valley. She must be an owner that cares about customers.
We will be back. Maybe regulars.
Kerry & Anne"}
{"text":"This place has good pasta!  We heard about this place from our friends and checked it out with them this passed Thursday.  They have fried pickles and calamari.  We all love fried calamari, so we always like trying it out at new places.  The fried calamari is light and crispy.  Also, it's not salty compared to a lot of Italian places we've gone too. 

Hubby ordered a special that was offered at the time we dined in; it was a cheese ravioli with homemade pesto sauce.  I ordered their shrimp with linguine and their homemade tomato/marinara sauce.  All their sauces are homemade.  Both dishes we're really tasty and fresh, really delicious!

Go check this place out if you like Italian food.  They have live music!  Good music.  But, the only complaint I have is: That night they had a live band playing and it was kinda loud for me."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, and I really like the wine bar. Nice place to pop in for happy hour or a quick dinner. Very friendly and you can tell it's not a chain.

Nice vibe, decent food-great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Where has this outstanding restaurant been all our lives.  We discovered Pestos on our anniversary and had the best Italian meal ever. We require take out.  Unlike 95% of the restaurants we frequent the order was exactly what we ordered.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident while going to the bank. I followed my nose to the great smells coming from the end of the strip mall. What a nice place.  Found out it's another independant that has survived for 15 years at this same location. Pizza slice was delicious. great wine bar and very nice atmosphere. I can't compare previous prices or portion size as some other reviewers have but I was happy with my food,prices and over all experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  Warm welcomes, great table choices, amazing menu, and outstanding service.  Everything that a restaurant should aspire to, they excel at.  The lasagna was the best my husband has ever had (including my homemade).  Great food choices, great wine list, casual (with a touch of elegance) atmosphere.  Love Pesto's!!!"}
{"text":"We had family in town who wanted Italian and I found this place on Yelp. Wow! Happy hour had a lot of options (mushrooms and calamari amazing!) and good wine ($4 who beats that). Food was really wonderful. But what took this experience over the top was our server, Carice, she was patient with each family member that had a million questions, she was attentive and  listened to what we were saying and made suggestions based on that (every suggestion she made was spot on!) We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"An incredible eatery in Arizona for those that appreciate an imaginative, experienced chef. The owner is personable and really focused on service and that family touch. Everything we have eaten here has been remarkable. Be sure to get the side specials menu. WOW! A neighborhood feel, with top chef quality food that you won't find on any other menu is Chandler. Wine bar is really nice too. Only regret, we did stop here years ago! We are glad to be part of the Pesto's family now!"}
{"text":"I give this place between 3-4 stars... 3 would be because of the service there... it's not the greatest but it's decent.

I rounded my review up to 4 stars because of the alcohol selection. The bar has an impressive selection of both liquors and liqueurs that you don't often see at a typical bar. It is nice to see businesses making drinks other than standard margaritas and vodka/crans. Every single specialty drink I have ever ordered from here was smooth and tasty. They also have a pretty decent Scotch selection which is fairly priced as well. 

Furthermore, the pizza is good although pricey... the white pizza is delicious and the basil really stands out on it. The standard cheese pizza that you can order by the slice really lacks any kind of wow factor though. If you order pizza from here, you should definitely order a whole pizza and ditch the by the slice option completely. 

Overall very cool place. I'd recommend going on a Saturday night when they have live music."}
{"text":"Very intimate setting, great decor, inviting atmosphere, and awesome service.  We love this place.  The menu is wonderful! We've been here 4 or 5 times now, and every time more than meets my expectations! The wine list is extensive and the staff knows how to pair the wine to the food.  We usually get what's on special, and the appetizers are a MUST! I recommend taking a date and enjoying a great meal!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant!  From the outside it looks like nothing special.. but once you taste the food, it's outstanding!!!  Almost every weekend there is a new duck special and it is always delicious.  More recently we had the Italian burger and it was so fabulous, we're returning two days later to have it again.  Another favorite menu item is the prosciutto with melon salad.  Their wine is great too!  The chef is very talented.  So wonderful to go to a local family owned restaurant and eat what tastes like award winning food.  We have also, always had friendly helpful servers and the service is never slow.  We try to eat low carb, and even though it's Italian, it's easy to find low carb menu items.  This is our favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"Never again.  terrible service, average pizza, ho hum wine list.  Took forever to get a glass of wine, never heard from the server after she dropped the pizza on the table.  AND the bill was unbelievably high for the quality of the food.  Server never asked us if we wanted another glass of wine or offered us dessert.  Don't go - There's nothing to like about this place."}
{"text":"Lovely family own restaurant. A true neighborhood gem.

Awesome service and really comfortable.

They have more high tops than regular tables so be aware if you go with kids our elder people.

I tried the calamari, cauliflower, custom pizza, pineapple Canadian bacon pizza and the lasagna. Very solid and well presented dishes. 

Be aware, servings are big.

Fit desert I had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream. There was no hot chocolate filling :'( the I've cream was delicious though.

Highly recommended and we'll be back and try other dishes (beet salad for sure).

So the missing star is because there's room for improvement. Which for them will be really easy to do.

Prices are fair.

Cheers"}
{"text":"The prices were a little high for what it is.  The pasta was good but a little bland, I got the linguine with white clam sauce.  The service was slow but in their defense,  it was a Saturday night and they apparently had just ran an article in the Arizona Republic.  I'd go again, but maybe just in the middle of the week in hopes it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Thursday April 9. We were a party of 7. The most amazing and generous portion for an appetizer was the spicy Califlower. It was so delish I could have eaten it as an entree. The wine tasting for their wine on tap was actually quite good and was only $10 for about an 8 oz combined pour.  The lasagna was ok, not the best I've had. My brother said the chicken Parmesan was delish. I would definitely go back when in the Phoenix/Chandler area"}
{"text":"Great Family owned restaurant. A friend took us here for their happy hour and stayed till close ... I guess you could say we had a great time! 

Everything that came out of this kitchen smelled, looked and tasted amazing! The Martini's were on point and the atmosphere couldn't have been better. 

Coming from someone who works for a family owned place myself, I can appreciate a local place that does everything right!

Can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Thank You Frank Taurisano,Owner of Pesto's (one of my fav family owned Italian places in town) for never letting me leave without a Rose in my hand in all these years. Thanks Deb for always greeting us with your warm smile. Great food clubbed with sweet n thoughtful gestures always. You guys surely know how to win a woman's heart.
Favourites- Garlic bread  , Tuscan Pizza and Pino Grigio."}
{"text":"This review does not address their pizza, which I haven't tried. Went there with a group of friends, ordered and shared lots of food. Bottom line: Great atmosphere, great wines, great appetizers, great desserts, so-so salads and friendly service (even though they forgot one of the sides we ordered), but the entrees ranged from fair to poor. The sauce on the lasagna and eggplant dishes tasted burnt, and the eggplant was sliced way too thick to be flavorful. Eggplant Parm or Rolatini is not for the lazy chef who doesn't have the time to do the painstaking preparation. The worst was the linguini in white clam sauce. It tasted like somebody dumped an entire container of peppercorns into what otherwise might have been a good entree. Consequently, the mild taste of the clams and pasta was completely destroyed by the flamethrower heat of pepper - NOT what linguini with clam sauce (red or white) is supposed to taste like. (What is this? Mexican-style Italian?!) Pesto's is fine as one of those trendy wine, appetizer and dessert bars, but for a real Italian meal, it leaves a LOT to be desired. They might also consider having waiters offer fresh grated cheese (Even the Olive Garden chain does that!)"}
{"text":"Good Pizza,Calzones nothing exceptional.Shopping center wine bar."}
{"text":"When we went the last time, the place was empty yet it seemed to take forever to order our food and the customer service after that was a bit lackluster.  The pizza was good but was nothing out of the ordinary.  And on previous occasions, I wasn't that impressed with their pastas either."}
{"text":"We had a friend introduce us to Pesto's a couple weeks ago and have already been back. 

My husband claims the chicken parmesan is the best he's ever had!! I must admit my Ziti & Grilled Chicken was great the first time so I couldn't make myself order anything else the second time, not disappointed!! We'll have to bring friends along so we can try other dishes, the pizza looks great!

Nice ambiance! Very cozy feeling, nice music on the weekends. Service is always great at this family run business. I would highly recommend for a dinner with friends or a romantic evening with your honey!"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour with my husband. They asked us if we had a reservation, we did not since it's happy hour. They extended a patio in the front of the restaurant and it looks very nice and they have space heaters. The house wine was great and the food was good.  Parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer. Ordered the lasagna; was really good. A little heavy on the ricotta for my liking, but had a good meaty sauce. 
Go early...small place, tends to fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Pestos is a good neighborhood wine bar. I've eaten their pizzas and cheese platters and found both to be very good. The cheese platter is an excellent side if you're enjoying the wine bar.  The staff has always been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Pestos but not to happy with the service.  I went there with my family and we ordered waters and an ice tea.  Had to ask twice for it then when we asked for sugar once again asked twice then got up and got my own. 

Food took awhile and surprised since they were not that busy since it was a Monday night.   I was surprised with the poor service.  Now the food was very good and I recommend the Pesto Chicken Ziti.  Unfortunately we had to eat it in the car since we had a meeting."}
{"text":"Great food!. Awesome atmosphere. Good service.  Love this place. I wish more restaurants would offer the low carb dish. Chandler's best kept secret."}
{"text":"The pasta, the pizza, the burgers, the specials....order anything and you won't be disappointed. They take pride in what they do. There's a reason this gem has been here for so long! The food is the best in the valley. The specials on the weekends will be hard to beat anywhere. We are so lucky such a great place is so close by! And their wine selection-amazing. Their recommendations are perfection. It isn't cheap, but not unreasonably expensive. You get what you pay for. Great food, great wine, great service!"}
{"text":"OMG what here is not to love? Meatballs are by far always a favorite and go to on the menu but everything we have tried is just fantastic. Oh and they nailed the lava cake-- highly recommend saving room for this desert. This is definitely a local gem and the owners always make you feel welcome and always remember you the next time. Great staff, great food, great place!"}
{"text":"Ok my first review wasnt the best but since they've remodeled the place, i love it!Great neighborhood spot to go for a drink and a bite to eat. Their cheese plate appetizer is delicious and the pesto pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"Favorite place for Antipesto pasta! Love that its family run and the ambience is low key. Saturday is live Jazz! Drinks are poored and mixed just right too!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday around 6pm, looking for a spot at the bar to have a glass of wine and an appetizer. The hostess, assuming the manager, immediately asked very pointedly \"Can I help you\" when I simply LOOKED into the bar.  She said they are very busy but she can seat me at the only spot left.  I thanked her, not knowing bar seats were not open seating.  I was awkwardly placed on the end, where she asked a woman to move her purse to allow me to sit.  WOW!  For the entire 40 minutes I was there, this woman openly complained about me sitting there, gave me several dirty looks, dramatically moved her wine glass over, dramatically slid her food... as if I was going to eat it or something.  Clearly she was a regular because the bartender spoke to her in a friendly manner and ignored me.  I was so uncomfortable the whole time.  The lady continued to make comments about me for 40 minutes!  I was approached by a bar back, ordered the bacon wrapped fig appetizer and wine.  Five minutes later the bartender asked what I wanted, I said the bar back took my order, and I then watched her tell the bar back my order.  UM? Why did you ask what I wanted if you aren't going to put it in to the kitchen?  The figs were overly sweet and mushy after about 3 of them. Could have used some cheese or something to cute the sweet flavor.  Overall, it was not a good experience.  Staff was not very friendly unless you are a regular."}
{"text":"Pesto's is always a great place to eat and have drink.  The antipasto salad with thier house dressing is awesome!  Although they are a wine bar thier bar is fully stocked with some great top shelf liquers.

And you can't forget ther pizza, my wife and I love their white pizza with pesto!"}
{"text":"Pesto's, it is a pleasure to write a review for this \"Neighborhood bar/restaurant\" from my experiences over the last several months during my short stay in Chandler, AZ this year. My boyfriend and I have really enjoyed and appreciated having such a quintessential neighborhood bar restaurant located 5 minutes from our house. What makes Pesto's so amazing is not only the great bar, Happy Hour and local feel, but it's amazingly delicious, quality food! 

This is a family owned business and the proprietors are quite pleasant and actually work and run the restaurant daily. I think this is part of the secret to the success of Pesto's. Their $5, 2pm-6pm Happy Hour is delicious and a great bargain for the food. I have enjoyed many tasty pizzas, salads, and cheese platters at Pesto's. The portions are generous and the vibe is very cool and laid back with nice low lighting. From the outside the looks of Pesto's is very deceiving, but once inside a quaint bar atmosphere is experienced with lots of locals frequenting the place.

My personal favorites are: the Malbec on tap, $5 Happy Hour bubbly, fresh pesto served with crostini, and the cheese platters. My friends have also enjoyed there freshly baked Tiramisu and swear by it. Anyway, thanks Pesto's for providing a cool, friendly, and yummy place in the neighborhood! I highly recommend this to anyone in the local area and it won't let you down when you have family/friends in town, as they will also undoubtedly fall in love with it!"}
{"text":"We went here with two friends for happy hour. Someone had called in, which wasn't a problem at first, but once it got busy, our waitress pretty much deserted us. 

I think the atmosphere was for a 40+ scene. There was only one other couple in the 20s or 30s there. 

For happy hour, the well drinks weren't bad (I get vodka and diet coke). The food though I thought could have been more for a $5 \"happy hour\" price. I know it's on discount, but I didn't realize they were such small portions. The pizza was good, but we stayed until after happy hour was over and my friend ordered a slice of pizza. It was HUGE, and I probably could have just gotten 2 slices for the same price as my 6\" pizza. 

They need to get some booths in there, they only had high top tables and just one or two lower tables. It's like they want a bar scene, but for a much older crowd. 

Overall a bit pricier than what I like for a pizza joint, but I would consider getting just the pizza to go since the dough was good. Also, it's in a very sketchy strip mall area. I was surprised by the inside!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and can't believe I've never rated them before.  This is a hidden gem in Chandler featuring authentic Italian yet never limits themselves to only traditional Italian like many other Italian stops.  The menu is diverse and the specials are always amazing.  The lamb special I had there the other night had to be the best i've ever had.  I've never had a mediocre meal here and always find myself saying \"we should come here more often\" when I leave.  

The owners are sweet and know their customers and even connected us (through our friends who are regulars) with an amazing private wine tour in Napa.  We had the most amazing time and will never forget that experience.  

The bar here is also outstanding.  I have friends that will only drink a cosmo here and their martinis are always perfect.  The wine selection is not only extensive but well vetted and fairly priced.  This is one of the few restaurants that I will not hesitate to blow through two bottles in an evening because I am always happy and don't feel like I'm getting ripped off.  

If you've never been here you need to give it a try.  This is the type of owner operated place that I enjoy supporting and they always make it very rewarding to do so."}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars! Found this place by accident while on vacation in AZ! 

Walked in around 7:00 and there was hardly anyone in the joint, they squished two tables together and sat our party of 7 down.  Within half an hour later, there were people waiting outside to get a seat.

Our waiter was great. The food was great! Had the chicken parm and do NOT forget to order the bacon wrapped dates!  I wouldn't bother with the stuffed mushrooms.  Try the sangria, cold and refreshing.

I will definitely go back if I am in the area again.  I wish Napa had good and AFFORDABLE food!"}
{"text":"Pesto's is everything a long-standing, local Italian restaurant should be - great food, happy hour options, good service, low key atmosphere, a patio for when the weather is nice. I love their white pizza (quote the husband, \"I love their white pizza...it is the best I've had in my life\"), cheesy chicken Parmesan, rotating specials, tiramisu (quote the husband, \"I love their tiramisu...it is the best I've had in my life.\") The food is big and homey, everything carb-y and good about American Italian food."}
{"text":"saturday night i had a craving for pesto pizza, so i decided to check this place out after a quick search on yelp. the place was situated in a nondescript strip mall on the northeast corner of ray and dobson. the restaurant was reasonably crowded, and the atmosphere was a little vacant. apparently they are in the middle of a remodel. 

we decided to sit at the bar due to the crowd and the cold feel to the rest of the restaurant. i ended up ordering the white pizza (with pesto) and a side salad with homemade italian dressing. the salad came out, and it was pretty tasty. my only complaints being that it was a little heavy on the dressing, and the bowl was like a plastic picnic bowl! strange.

the pizza was amazing. the crust was not thick or thin and had a fabulous flavor. i loved the ricotta, and the pesto was superb. i just wish they had a been a little more liberal with the pesto. it was more of a drizzle.

i would definitely return here, and i'm sure the decor will improve once the remodel is complete. if only it were a little closer to home, so i could stop by for takeout."}
{"text":"Very unimpressive food, though the restaurant itself is pretty cool. Very modern, chill vibe in the bar and dining room.

Ordered a veg pizza and a calzone. Both were mediocre at best, and felt like they could have come from Pizza Hut, not a nice restaurant.

The pizza had a crust akin to take and bake pizza from grocery store. I'd been better off going next door to Frys and getting a pizza; at least that wouldn't have set me back $20. Terrible value, and the pizza was barely average at best. Anyone who thinks this is one of the better pizza joints in Phoenix is an utter tard.

Calzone was the same story. Small, mostly crust, and not particularly tasty. 

Very limited beers on tap, too.

From my table in the dining room, I was very disappointed to see at least two microwaves in non-stop use in the hour I was there. Unacceptable in an establishment charging premium prices for reheated shit. 

Better options out there, especially for the money. Unless you're a late 40's \"sociallite\" that thinks it's cool to order mediocre food and 13 glasses of wine in a strip mall restaurant in Chandler, then I would avoid this place unless you have money to throw away."}
{"text":"The rose at the end of the evening - so appreciated and so special! Hugs to owner Frank and son Noah- so welcoming - great food - superlative service."}
{"text":"The black garlic pasta is amazing! I should've taken a picture before I ate it! My husband got the mussles and said 'perfect blend of Old Bay and the other seasonings - absolutely delicious!'. We're never disappointed here - the main menu is always cooked to perfection but the specials are oh so good! Great staff - great food  - great place!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, creative and delicious menu choices, a fantastic wine menu with very knowledgeable staff. This restaurant is one of our favorite places. It's the type of place where everyone knows your name and remembers you and your favorite meal and wine choices."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! First time here and OMG no more Olive Garden for me Pesto's is my new favorite Italian restaurant.... and what can I say about the 800 gallon fish tank in love"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at this restaurant. The food is that good and the menu that varied! But then they went and redecorated, removing the booths, tables and chairs, replacing them with tall tables and high stools. The furniture is so uncomfortable I don't go here often, (although I do still order take out), which is too bad. Everything on the menu is delicious including the salads, pastas and pizza."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite restaurant! I've been bringing family and friends to Pesto's for the past 10 years and have made it my birthday dinner tradition for most of those years. The transformation over the years has been beautiful to watch. The staff is very friendly, and I love how the owners are fully involved with the day to day business. Not to mention, the food is amazing! The Greek salad, stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and linguini with clam sauce are among my favorites."}
{"text":"Awesome attention to detail.. servers actually shine the wine glases, and prime the beer glasses accordingly cold and clean."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour and they did not disappoint.  Ordered the bacon wrapped figs-tai wings- small pizza and meatball sliders.  So the figs and wings were fantastic and the pizza and sliders were pretty good. Service was so so ambiance gets a 10!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place was nothing more than a hole in the wall :) I went here a couple of months ago and WOW! What a change! The food is still delicious as ever, but they have really upgraded the place and it is a really nice restaraunt now. A great place to go for a first date."}
{"text":"Best burger in the city not like you really want to have a burger at an Italian place. Family owned so it has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our go to place, when craving neighborhood pizza and wine in Chandler.  Great ambiance, solid food and warm friendly service, especially from Vicky, our favorite hostess and Dayna, our favorite server.  

Try the Tuscan pizza and wash it down with a bottle of Vista Point cabernet."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night at 7 two weeks ago. We were seated right away. The place was a little less than half full. Then for the next 20 minutes we're completely ignored, not even water. After about 20 minutes, the same waiter, Brandon, who was attending to the table next to us, come to find out was our waiter. He finally came over to take our order. In the whole twenty minutes not even an acknowledgement eventhough he had walked past us 5 or 6 times. I would have understood if he had simply said it will be a few minutes but just to be ignored not knowing who was our waiter was annoying. The food was small but delicious thus the three stars. They had also ran out of dessert. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews so I was initially very excited to try it.

 The staff seems very friendly, clean establishment, great happy hour prices and interesting wine flights. I appreciate places that have seasonal items and have menus that change with the seasons. Pestos has regulars that are very polite and mature and the staff greets them very warmly.

  Started the evening with an old fashioned,I asked what fruits they use and got a weird look from the bartender. I then asked if they had sugar cubes, and I got that, \" this guy is going to be a pain stare\". I decided to stop asking questions at the point and just take what I got.

Ordered calamari and wings off the happy hour menu. Both were good. The wings had a very deceiving spiciness to them which I enjoyed. 

Wife had the Halibut off the specials and I had the duck. The sides were good but the protein on both entrées missed the mark. The halibut was well done (overcooked) and the bloodline was visible. The fat was not rendered off the skin of my duck which made it rubbery. Very poor execution on both dishes.

Dessert was a complete let down for me. I ordered an expresso and ricotta cheesecake,which sounds to die for, but I got what looked like a store bought tart shell filled with chocolate pudding and topped with chocolate mousse and whipped cream. You seriously needed to stab the crust to break it. My wife ordered a banana tart with the same issue - the spoon literally bent on trying to eat it.

All in all, $175+ spent on a less than average meal."}
{"text":"We just finished a beautiful dinner here at Pesto's Italian Kitchen. We both had the lasagna, it is perfection. The Ned Pinot Noir was wonderful and we capped off the meal with a wonderful dessert that they prepared especially for Valentine's. Our server, Daniel was very helpful and just attentive enough, the owner even stopped over to check on us on what was obviously a very busy night. Couldn't have asked for anything more, thank you Pesto's!!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. The food was incredibly appetizing. The price was a little high for me but we'll definitely return to try some other entree's. Honestly the menu options look like you just can't go wrong. The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Great for date night or lunch with the kids. The name says it all...anything with pesto is excellent.  Prices are reasonable especially for the quality.  We've been there 3 times now and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to hide for a romantic dinner or dessert and drinks. The owner always comes to our table with a rose and the servers are well versed in the wine and food selections. LOVE Pesto's!"}
{"text":"The best authentic, Italian food!! However, my favorite are the honey sambuca chili wings! I'm a wing fanatic and these wings never disappoint!! Flavorful, juicy, sweet but spicy. A combination I normally wouldn't gravitate to but the were recommended to me, so I'm HIGHLY recommending to you! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Recently(5/2015) went there again to meet a friend, same impression...male owner is a serious buffoon !

I live near this place and have over the last 5 years tried it many times. That said it is sad when someone is an owner and does not greet you or offer to get you a (overpriced) drink when you sit down and the bartender is busy ..this is typical not an exception.
       The female half of Pesto's is nice and attentive and genuine but the male half is a turd! I will not give business to this establishment simply because of his blase' attidude about clientele.If she divorved him and retained the bar I would go back and tell all my visiting out of town clients to go there too since now I lead them away from there  when asked where to get a good glass of vino and food.
       Food is ok and sometimes tasty but overpriced for the amount and quality. 
       If the bartender is Jason he is outstanding and I hope he gets recruited to work somewhere with more pleasant ownership.
       Really just a hang-out for suburban wanna-be wine drinking botox/fake boobs I think I\"m still in college moms and the \" I own a Harley and the t-shirt that says Harley and the bandana that says Harley and a Harley ring and Harley socks\"  inane boring golf -playing overly self-importance Viagra using Harley riding tools disguised as men."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The wait staff, the HH deals (favorite chicken Caesar salad!) and the ambiance is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early dinner. It was our first time here. What a lovely experience. It seemed like a family-run restaurant, and everyone was so friendly. I had the eggplant Parmesan and it was really delicious. The place seems to be full of regulars so it has a nice neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"The food was good. Not the greatest but not bad. The service was excellent. Staff went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place ... family owned ... good food and drinks ... there is no better \"neighborhood joint\" in the east valley!

Frank and Diane have really transplanted a New Yawk neighborhood place kind of vibe that this Brooklyn transplant misses and is blessed to find nearby ... great food (Yo chef ... mad props!), great service and owned and run by wonderful people."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Frys Shopping Center, Pesto's is definitely a hidden gem for any wine and Italian enthusiast. This family owned and operated restaurant is fairly quiet with a calm and inviting decor. 

The main attraction for us is their Happy Hour deals which are arguably the best specials in the area. And when I say Happy Hour, it should really be Happy Afternoon, holy crap! Mon-Sat from 12-6p and Sunday 3-6p, they offer 9 different wines, martinis, and draft beers for $4-6 each. And they aren't pours that compliment the price! $5 for a FULL pour that's normally $12? Deal. 

But their special's don't stop at drinks! They offer a great selection of appetizer style munchies from a bowl of olives for $3 up to a Mini charcuterie cheese board for $8. Needless to say we have frequented their Happy Hours a few times just for a nice affordable date.

In the times we've gone to Pesto's we've tried their Calamari, Honey Sambuca Chile Wings, Personal Pizza, Meatball Sliders, and Bowl of Pasta. The champion of these is definitely the wings. 6 good sized wings with a flavorful and (legit) spicy wing sauce. Yeah, can I have like 20 orders of this? Thank you! 

Their pizza is also amazing. While I have yet to try a signature pizza, their personal pizza was enough to sell me on trying their normal pizza. A reasonable size crust that is cooked till crispy and isn't overly doughy with a balanced blend of cheeses. The tomato was well balanced and complimented the pizza without flooding it. 

The Pasta Bowl and the Meatball Sliders were a slight let down, mainly due to the tomato sauce. The meatballs themselves were great but the sauce on both dishes was a bit too sweet for my liking and a slightly watery. But both plates were still enjoyable to eat, especially at the happy hour price. Just not my thing.

All in all you're going to have a great dining experience here. The staff has always been friendly and on top of things and the prices are beyond reasonable during their \"Happy hour\". Makes for a great afternoon date before hitting the movies or headed out on the town."}
{"text":"Pesto's was good, not great. We stopped in at lunch time but were underwhelmed with their lunch specials. So we went for it and tried mozzarella sticks as an app and the Mediterranean Pizza as a shared entree. The cheese sticks were yummy, fresh and the bread coating on them was just perfect. Even though the pizza used fresh ingredients as well, it was VERY oily. The crust was nice but it wasn't any better than Rosatti's or even Costco pizza for that matter. Our server was quite friendly but our experience at Pesto's will probably be a one-time happening. And for the expensive price, I can think of several other places I'd rather spend my $$$$ at."}
{"text":"Everything about Pesto's is excellent, from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food!  Don't let the restaurant's location in a strip mall fool you, it's a top notch place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I love this intimate place. When the work day has been less than kind happy hour is your answer. A great glass of wine, sambouca wings and calamri...casual yet intimate and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I have gone here several times and have tried the pizza, subs and the calzones.  I have not had anything there that I did not like and the only reason I don't give this five stars is because everytime I am in there it seems a large group with lots of young kids has just sat down (or come to run around me while I try to eat) at the same time as my date and I.  I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children.

Anyway, this place has awesome food, good service and if you can handle large groups of families then I highly recommend you take the drive out here to give it a try."}
{"text":"Pesto's - where have you been all my life?!?!?!  It was my pick Saturday night for dinner, only to find out my hubby had been for lunch a couple years ago.  Boy, was he surprised!  Who knew such a cute wine/pizza/pasta place was inside?  The decor is gorgeous - and I loved the beaded curtain and high top tables!  

As for food - I had the BEST Calzone (the Pesto) I've ever had!  It wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect.  We also loved Pesto's take on the caprese, with greens added.  There were lots of options for wine too.    The hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was \"okay\", but he's picky when it comes to pizza.

Granted, we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking.  If you're looking for a more \"adult\" environment, I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  As we were leaving, they were setting up some live music.  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lounge and restaurant perfect for a Thursday afternoon HH!  Check out the extensive wine list, great appetizers and amazing entrees!  The pizza is solid and it is family friendly! Pestos at Ray and Dobson is worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"Pesto's is pretty good. A tad on the high side as far as prices go, but the portions are large so you might get two meals out of it. I tried the house made pesto and pasta with shrimp. The pesto tasted like parmesan cheese with garlic. I didn't taste much basil or other fresh herbs, but it was still good. The rest of my group was satisfied too. The food just lacked a certain fresh quality that I think defines a truly unique Italian food experience."}
{"text":"I am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salty when the waitress asked me how everything was I had to say something. She was very nice and offered me another dish but I declined. Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said \"well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you\" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot."}
{"text":"A friend referred me to this place.  Inside is very nice and comfortable.  Service that night was not great, the kitchen seamed to be behind, some people were complaining but we did not, it was obvious our server was a bit overwhelmed.  And because he knew we were waiting quite a long time he took our appetizers off the bill, nice of him.  We had shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were large and fresh and the cocktail sauce was very good.  We also had the Alfredo crab pizza OMG!!! never had crab on a pizza but it was so good, rich, but so very good.  Ended the meal with some gelato, fresh, creamy, hit the spot.  Defiantly going back again, several items on the menu that caught my attention."}
{"text":"Total accident that was ended up there. Just at the end of the lunch hour which runs until 3 .  

We each had spaghetti and meatballs. 

Excellent! 

Order of olives.

Excellent !

Service. 

Excellent !

End of review"}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale but coming back here for years . Anytime I want to score major points with my wife I bring home the lamb burger. The apps, the specials, wine selection etc.. Always top notch."}
{"text":"A most unexpected gem! If you are a wine drinker, fabulous flights! Great selection! I can't say much more other than... AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pesto's. Local business owners that have it right. Small intimate restaurant, great happy hour EVERY DAY from 12-6, and a terrific staff. This is the Italian place YOU need to support. Food is outstanding and an awesome wine list, if you stop you MUST order the bacon wrap dates. I would would work here and you could pay me each week in dates. If I was a waiter here, overtime I delivered a plate of those, I would guarantee one would make its way into my mouth overtime. This is the perfect first date place."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place one Friday night. Remembered Pesto's from my High School days at Chandler High when we went there for lunch. Back then, it was a little hole in the wall and had a counter you walked up to to order. I was surprised because now the restaurant is contemporary and a sit down restaurant. The decor inside is gorgeous yet, the place is still small giving it an intimate feel. I loved the wine wall and the beading separating the bar from the actual restaurant. 
Anyhoo, my husband and I opted for the appetizer sampler plate which came with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant bruschetta, and fried ravioli. The mushrooms were ok (Ive had better, Haus Murphy's has the best!), the ravioli were great but I prefer mine with meat, and the eggplant bruschetta was pretty good though different from your standard bruschetta. I could have done without the kalamata olives which I think are a bit too salty.
For our meals, I got the spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatball and my husband got the meat calzone with sausage and pepperoni. I loved the spaghetti and meatballs! The meatballs were flavorful, big and meaty, and soft the way a meatball should be. I probably didn't even need to get extra because they were huge but I am glad I did since they were so yummy. I never thought I would say this but they might be as good if not better than Rigatony's meatballs. The hub said his calzone was good but it didn't seem that fresh. The cheese was not oozing from it like it would with one that just came out of the oven. 
I am a total canoli connoisseur so I felt that it was my duty to try one at Pesto's. Boy am I glad I did because this was one of the best canoli's I think i have ever had! It had chocolate chips in it but what really kicked it up a notch was that it had salted pistachio's on it which gave it the sweet and salty effect. It was lovely! I probably should have gotten the mini canoli but I am kinda glad I got the big one. GO BIG OR GO HOME! Anyways, Pesto's was pretty good although the service was a little slow. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Friday night at 6 and there were still tables open. I hope this place doesn't go under cause where will I go to get a canoli fix??? WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Great food,  loved the jazz Saturday night and staff was great.  1st time there and will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, reasonable prices. What more do you need to know? The tiramisu was incredible."}
{"text":"I get a small pesto pizza and side salad- (and the cheesecake is always great too )- one of my all time fav meals. They are always nice at Pestos. It is a great neighborhood restaurant - and the wine bar is great too."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious and they have an awesome wine selection. Its a family owned joint and they take pride in what they do. I have met the son, Noah, and he displayed outstanding customer service. We had questions about the different cheeses that were served and he came to the table to answer all of our questions with sweetness and patience. If you are on a budget, try coming in for the lunch specials. The pizza is really good and they use very quality meats and cheeses. 
Two big thumbs up: )
Bon apetit"}
{"text":"Just like so may places in the Phoenix area that just look like another little restaurant in a strip mall this place is great. 

Great wine selection. Very nice menu of pastas, pizza and more. The service was quick. 

We both ordered a pasta. Mine was the baked Ziti and my daughters was a pesto based pasta. Both were excellent. 

Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find! The interior is quaint and cute. They have a bar area and a dining area. We were greeted and got a nice table. The menu has so many delicious items to choose from. We started with the calamari and warmed olives. The calamari had lots of small pieces with tentacles, the best!!! I has the caprice salad and ordered the eggplant rolentini. The salad was huge! Nice heirloom tomatoes and fresh motz. The rolentini was fresh, moist and the sauce, just like my moms! REAL ITALIAN FOOD HERE FOLKS!!!  Our waiter Noah was on point! He answered questions and made suggestion. The wine list is extensive and lots of choices. They even have pistachio gelato! We will be back for happy hour and for many many more dinners. So happy we found a place that makes food like our moms used to!!!"}
{"text":"So so good! Great wine and liquor selection for starters. Our server Noah was great and very attentive for the restaurant being so busy. We ordered the caprese and olives for apps. They both were delicious. We also ordered spaghetti and meatballs, the grilled chicken ziti dish, and Alfredo linguini, all had great flavor. The grilled chicken dish was the favorite of the table! We will definitely be back. Tip - make a reservation, especially for the weekend nights! Great patio too with fans and misters, it's actually very nice outside on their patio!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dinner and have not had a single bad thing to say about their food or service. From the appetizer to the salad to the bread that comes with the entree, nothing has been less than perfect. The servers were attentive even on a busy night. Our water glasses were never half way empty. A must try if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade Italian food. I went for happy hour with a group of girls so we got to try a bunch of different items. The salads are so delicious and the lasagna is out of this world!! The waitress said it takes them 8 or 12 hours because everything is made from scratch and wow, you can really tell."}
{"text":"Great find.... THANKS TO YELP!

Just moved to the neighborhood and while looking to find a new local hangout decided to give this place a try and LOVED IT!

Great Bar, and food. Cant want till next time to drive in and walk home!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a super low key, quaint, Italian restaurant, this is SO your place. They have amazing food and their prices are pretty reasonable!"}
{"text":"Nice little wine bar.  I enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch.  Pretty tasty.  The food won't win any culinary rewards, but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh. Minor niggle, they only seem to have high-top seating... when all I want to do is curl up in a booth and drink myself silly, this can be a problem."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  My wife and I shared the beet salad (big enough to share for sure), and made short work of it.  The warm bowl of olives was a nice accompaniment.  Our entrees were a salmon on risotto special and the eggplant parmesan.  Both reminded me of the finest Italian food I've had in much bigger cities at restaurants that charge a lot more.  The proprietors Frank and Deb know their regular customers and treat them like family, something you don't see in the restaurant business much anymore.

Given the paucity of fine dining in downtown Phoenix, the trip out to Chandler is worth it to eat here.  Next time we're in town, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food with even greater service. Go sit at the bar on Saturday evenings and tell Katie, Will sent you. Don't be afraid to order something off the specials menu. Everything here is absolutely amazing!!!

READER E&D TIP: Try the Lamb Burger (my top 3 burger of all time)."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary.  So I open up YELP and start looking for something different, something good.  I spotted this near our office.  Good reviews, never been here...let's go!

The atmosphere is very nice.  A touch of class to it.  The menu was a simple over-sized heavy paper.  Lots of interesting dishes listed.  The waiter recommended a few, and we ended up going with two of his suggestions.  First was the ziti and chicken.  It came in a white sauce with pesto.  (A lot of their dishes have pesto, which may be why they named the restaurant \"Pesto's\"!)  It was very tasty, and the portion was quite reasonable.  Something different from a lot of Italian restaurants (and vastly better than most of the chains like Olive Garden).

The other dish was their Italian burger.  It was BIG.  And surprisingly good.  Very nice seasoning and toppings.  Not an ordinary burger!  Our waiter was two for two.

We had a very nice anniversary lunch.  I think it safe to say we'll be coming back.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants something different than typical Italian fare (though they did have a lasagna I was tempted to try...maybe next time!)."}
{"text":"Pretty nice decor (although it was freezing cold inside this evening).  We had the Tex Mex pizza which was very good.  The food was a little overpriced, compared to most local pizza places, but it was better than most.  Probably my fifth or sixth favorite pizza place in town as of right now."}
{"text":"Thanks Chef Chad for the 40lbs. Suckling Pig you prepared for our painting party.  It was delicious.  I recommend anyone hosting a party and NOT wanting to cook to give them a call.  It was a show stopper and tummy pleaser!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious  bars is beautiful  my favorite  part is the live jazz Saturday  nights. And management  is super courteous  and pleasant"}
{"text":"Based our visit off the Yelp reviews and was very happy with our choice. Food was good and wine selection was great. Not your typical selections which was nice to try something new. My only complaint was the lack of break basket and dipping oil. If I have a bread basket I'm more prone to sit there and drink more wine. Overall we would absolutely return as the overall experience was great!! #butgetsomebreadbaskets"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight and it definitely won't be our last! Great service and amazing food. If you haven't you need to come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good food, everyone is friendly. My waiter was the managers son, apparently. I hear him call her mom in front of other patrons. I was seated 5 minutes before the table behind me and he waited them first. When I was waiting for my check. I waited 10 minutes and saw him get checks for two other tables before the hostess came over to me and asked if I needed anything. I cashed out with her and left. GREAT PIZZA, they should hire more professional waiters.  I will not be back. La Familia Pizza is much better and the wait staff is much more competent."}
{"text":"Probably one of my new favorite places to eat and hang out!  I went there last weekend and sat at the bar, ordered a fantastic martini, amazing appetizers and super yummy pizza.  LOVE the \"hole in the wall\" feel but when you get in there you feel like you stepped into a different place.  It was recently remodeled so it has a swanky feel inside.  Couple that with truly tasty food and the nice staff, you got yourself a dynamo place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place, in my opinion, is a bit overrated. I think part of the reason is because of it's location in Chandler, where there isn't much else.

On a positive note, yes the decor is nice, with a laid back feel. As for the food, we chose a calzone that was smothered in marinara and the \"Pasta Greek.\" The calzone was really good but the pasta dish was lacking flavor. The chicken in it was overcooked and tasteless and the one thing that stood out the most were the kalamata olives, which were delicious. And for the price of the pasta, I would've thought the portion was gonna be larger. Just saying.....this place serves Italian right? Then where's my leftovers? Derrr.

I really wanted to try their pizza but I couldn't justify $16 for a 10\" pizza when I've had what I KNOW to be awesome pizzas for less at places like Bianco and Cibo.

Overall, a pretty decent experience, mostly I'm sure because of the company, but I probably won't go back just because of location and because I think they're trying too hard but don't quite deliver."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant the first week opened - 19 years ago.  I still can't find the cannoli's Frank makes.  Pizza there is flavorful and New York style.  I Like the Italian dish choices for take out too.  I love the decor in the bar."}
{"text":"The food is good.
The wine is great.
The service is meh.
The ambiance is thumbs up for being in a shopping center."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it's close to my job. Their website stated Happy Hour is from noon-6pm. I went with colleagues at 1pm and was told that the website is 3-4 mos. old and HH won't start until 2pm. I did not appreciate the false advertising/bait-and-switch, but I was hungry and so were my co-workers. 
  PROS: During HH, the chicken caesar? salad is awesome & only $5
            The olives were delicious (they're served in a bowl of olive oil-       messy, but yummy.)              
  CONS: None of our water glasses were refilled for 30 minutes and I had to wave my arms to get the waiter (Tyler) to refill our water glasses.                      
            The calamari is served with a weird Asian mayo rather than just simple, yummy, complimentary marinara sauce.
             The pricey \"cheese plate\" consisted of small, scraped pieces of cheese that have to be scooped with a spoon to be put onto the bread.
             The cocktail menu offers \"Chef's Choice.\" When we asked about it, Tyler said \"It's whatever the chef wants to make.\" So we said we'll try it, but he said the chef wasn't in and nobody else can make it. 
   Overall, it's too bad that this place missed out on getting repeat business from several of us who work nearby."}
{"text":"Family owned delicious pizzeria and wine bar. Get there early though, there's usually a small wait. The chicken pesto pasta, pizza, meatballs and Greek salad rock! Casual dining and good for a date or the whole family."}
{"text":"10 inch \"combo\" w/ hardly any meat, not by request, was decent BUT $16?! 10 inch is almost as small as a personal size pizza. Get over urself Pesto's Pizza. If you're looking for awesomely delicious pizza where they give you your money's worth, try Nellos - get \"the skinny\""}
{"text":"I don't know about the rest of their food but we just ordered to gluten free pizzas and we're terribly disappointed. They were the size that you would expect for a childs pizza and cost $20 each with no more than a few toppings. I'm sure the rest of the food is good but I would never go back because being gluten free doesn't mean you should have to pay twice as much for your food as everyone else. Thank you for trying but those pizzas should be bigger."}
{"text":"Comfortable, semi fancy wine bar, great atmosphere, great service, great food= perfect for date night. 
This place is everything you like about fancy wine bars without the uppity attitude. Prices are reasonable and I'd say lower than an avg wine bar but the food is delicious: pasta, pizza, etc so don't expect postino type food here. I think of it as a step up from Floridino's with a date night atmosphere."}
{"text":"I only got to this place once while I was in Arizona and really intended to go back--maybe next trip!.  They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce, an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in California--San Fillipo's in La Mesa.  My daughter got the calzones, which she had had here before and knew they were good.  I had a taste and while that is an item I never order, they were delicious!  The atmosphere here was very nice also and I was really glad we had chosen it.  It's one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so I don't have other experiences to compare it to, but I really like Pesto's. My ravioli was great, and the salad was amazing. They make their Italian dressing there, and it is just unbelievable. I am a Caesar girl, but this was fantastic. I was there for work so I couldn't drink, but the wine selection looked great. I would recommend this place for sure, and I will be stopping in again soon."}
{"text":"Really good food and also provides catering.  We've been coming since before the remodel.  I've catered for work events before as well.  The little wine bar room is cute.

I think because we always come early or late for lunch or dinner, we never have a wait.

Nice little gem, tucked away in a shopping center.  Give it a try doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I was a little girl, one of the few foods I just couldn't stomach was eggplant. My mom served in drenched in egg and fried in oil. Even as an adult, I just didn't see the point of the lowly vegetable. 

But Pesto's changed all that. The first time I tried their grilled eggplant pizza all I could think was, Eggplant-- where have you been all my life? Maybe if my mother had been Italian... 

Everything at Pesto's is made from scratch, from the pasta to the salad dressing. And he sophistication factor just went up with the recent addition of a wine bar."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a big selection of Wine. The pizza ranks as \"pretty good\" for east coast standards, but \"damn good\" for Phoenix for sure. The house specialty is some kind of pasta-alfredo-chicken and a few other choice ingredient combo which is REALLY RICH and tastes great but sits pretty heavy. It's a nice place to go for dinner for 2 and not blow tons of cash (if you live way out there)."}
{"text":"We tried Pesto's based on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed!  We sat at the bar and I had a glass of their house Cabernet, which was great.  We shared the beet salad to start and it was just amazing!  We followed that with the white pizza topped with pesto and fresh roma tomatoes.  It was the best pizza we've had in a really long time.  The bartenders were friendly and service was great!  I'm so glad we discovered this place!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had the stuffed mushrooms for an app, so darn good i ordered seconds. Ordered ziti and grilled chicken for dinner, my fiance tasted it and finished it for me. So now I'm ordering seconds on the ziti to go.  Glad I live close to yet another place where the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed....have heard great things and remembered this place from years ago.  First we waited for too long to even be greeted once we were seated, nearly left.  The server was mostly sarcastic from the beginning...then the salads arrived...with everything we asked to be left off, the servers excuse was that he \"asked them to rush them\", the baked ziti was awful, too much ricotta which resulted in a plate of mush ....the waiter asked if it was okay when he finally checked on us (note: after we were finished) and when we were presented with the check the server refused to take off the entree...I asked that the entree be removed which resulted with the arguing that he wouldn't do it and finally grabbed the check (along with our card) off the table and loudly stating I could speak to the owner about it.  He returned some time later with the adjusted check, no visit from the owner, no apologies, nothing.  Any indication along the way that they were attempting to make it right and we would have given it another chance, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Awesomeness.  Went here for lunch to finally check the place out.  Great lunch deals!  Had a salad, slice of pizza and soft drink for 7.25,  delicious, great house Italian dressing and really good salad, pizza is up there in taste. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the past few months and I have always been amazed. With the addition of their new Chef comes a whole new experience you wouldn't expect from a 'pizza place'; but this is so much more. Every night they have a special menu available and prepared by the Chef himself. Having ate at all of the best restaurants in the Valley; I can tell you this Chef knows his stuff. The seafood he prepares is amazing and Debbie (The owner) always has some amazing wines available to pair perfectly with the dish. You'll find true Italian dishes and some amazing 'New American' offerings as well. The service and atmosphere are always relaxing yet, refined. If this place were in Scottsdale, I'd expect to pay 60-80 per dish; but it's not. So the prices for the quality of food you get are such an amazing deal. The staff is always willing to do whatever they can to accommodate you in anything that you want. If you're in the Chandler area, go try this place, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner.  From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - I didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern.  
Pesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards.  Instead, it's a very nice spot to take a date, or to just belly up to the bar solo (as I did).
Service was friendly and fast, and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on hand.
Great atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious calzone. Drenched in sauce and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite place of mine. The service standards have gone downhill quite a bit. One example is I waited 10 minutes for a refill on iced tea, at the bar. The food is still outstanding, but I think I will take my hard earned money to Sal's Gilbert Pizza. You have truly let me down Pesto's."}
{"text":"Just Superb!!!!! The best pizza in Arizona!!! Fresh ingredients and amazing service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the king of family owned and run, traditional authentic Italian cuisine. The wife and I come often and never leave unsatisfied. Try the Popeye pizza or the grilled chicken pesto with pasta. Or maybe the chicken parmesan will make a believer out of you. Anything with a great glass of wine and amazing personal service. Try pesto's tonight. You'll love it. -kia"}
{"text":"Deb and her staff make us feel like we are the only ones there ... every time we go.  They always have a wonderful array of specials, not to mention the best pizza this side of Chicago!"}
{"text":"Fantastic local spot with great food and wine.  I had the lamb chops while my wife had a pesto pasta dish.  The wine selection is good at decent prices.  Great place to bring the kids or a date night."}
{"text":"Touchdown we were so lucky to find thus place on yelp! 

Great selection of wine & food! The owner Frank was very friendly and personable! 

The canollys were delicious, had white zin ! 

Happy hour best 1/2 OFF great selection of wine and appetizers!!! 

Definitely coming back on V day !!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, asked some friends where I should take the wife out for dinner on her birthday. They all suggested this wonderful little place! And I think the fact that the waiter was very helpful was what made this trip a success, shout out to her, Julie! We asked her what the best type of pizza was she said Tuscan, this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had! We saw a lot of different dishes coming out and they all looked very tasty so we will definitely be back to try the other stuff !"}
{"text":"I've lived here a long time and tried so many pizza places. This is the best I've had so far, by far! I will go back here from now on when I have the pizza craving. Great service, great pizza, and reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed two FABULOUS meals here!  Being new to Arizona, I feared that I would never find a wine bar up to snobby standards...  but I have!  Primarily they feature Italian wines (which are quite wonderful!), but also have a few interesting frenchies and, of course, West Coast wines.  I hope you go when they are serving Creme Brulee Donuts...  for the love..."}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet pizza and great cocktails! Loved the personalized and friendly service from the owner. Really interesting, yummy desserts too! Went for a relative's birthday. We had a party of four. We were seated right away. Drink orders taken quickly. They serve water with cucumber in it to clean your palate for wine. However, we didn't have wine. One in our party sampled a wine but she was tempted by the 1944 Mai Tai cocktail which we all tasted and it was spectacular. Fun cocktail names too! I can't believe they've been in business 19 years. I moved to Chandler 17 years ago only two miles away from this restaurant and I've never been to Pesto's all this time. Shame on me. However, I will definitely be back and bring friends and family. Would like to try the happy hour for some more delish cocktails and some more of the specialty pizza flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! If they had more craft beers on tap I would've given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Very CLEAN and love the fish tank!  The lunch menu is poor with few selections, but of those selections you will find something to delicious.

We went with with the salad and cheese pizza.  The salad was filling and the dressing very tasty. The cheese pizza was huge and very good.  I love pizza and want to try out places that claim to be the best and this place was really good.  Not as good as NYC, but still really good.

The staff was friendly and our food was out in a timely manner.  The prices are HIGH, but that is to be expected for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Pesto's is delicious! After many recommendations, my husband and I decided to give it a try for my birthday dinner. So glad we did! I got a sugar plum princess drink, the ravioli, and a cannoli. My husband got pizza, a beer, and gelato. We were so full and happy. Highly suggest everyone tries this place out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried a lot of different pizza places in the valley area.  Everything seems to be thin crust and I just don't like that.  This is just standard pizza, but being here it makes it seem pretty thick.  The price is reasonable.  We had two calzones and mozzarella cheese bread and were very impressed by the flavor.  The size is decent compare to other restaurants.   The dining room is very loud. If you're hearing impaired, probably not a good idea to go during peak hours.  Overall decor is meh... The staff was very attentive to our table and was fairly informative regarding menu options.  Extensive wine selection will cost you significantly more although they have a selection of some reds and whites from $12-15 a bottle.  We managed to eat for 2 with an appetizer for ~35."}
{"text":"When I have guests in from out of town - this is where I take them. Exceptional Italian cuisine, a lovely atmosphere and a great staff. Could you ask for more? The owners come around to the tables and greet you to make sure you're enjoying your meal. They recommend wines and side dishes to complement what you've ordered and they're always spot on. I love this place. A really wonderful place carefully hidden in a strip mall that you wouldn't pay attention to if you didn't know about it. Treat yourself to something remarkable and get to Pesto's. I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick couple glasses of wine.   Loved this place!   Very cute little wine bar.   Wine was good,  as were the appetizers.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great here. They had a HUGE wine selection and a great menu. The food was tasty too. However, the waitress wasn't very attentive and the portions were tiny in comparison to the prices. I paid $35 for their low-carb option and 2 glasses of wine. Everyone else in our group loved their food as well. I think you could get a better bang for your buck elsewhere, though."}
{"text":"Random wine bar in a shopping center alert! 

Lovely, dark interior and fun wine decor - Where am I again?! 

Given this criteria, Pesto's is one of the best options for Happy Hour in our neighborhood; a very casual and affordable date afternoon. 

Wait, Happy *Hour*? 

Try 12-6PM. I *think* it's Monday-Saturday as I know we showed up on a Sunday once and it appears they open later. 

You can get several wines, champagnes, cocktails and beers for $4-$5 a glass. 

The small plates are anything but small. For $5, you can get a personal pizza, six FATTY sized honey sambuca wings, meatball sliders, a bowl of pasta . . . $8 will get you cheese plates, charcuterie. 

Get those honey sambuca wings - You'll thank me later. Out of everything we've tried, these are the favorite and a go-to. The perfect blend of sweet and spicy with a slightly crispy finish.  

Also took my sister and her gals here for her bachelorette party dinner. 

It certainly wasn't the traditional rowdy bachelorette group, but Pesto's handled all 8 of us without missing a beat. Other patrons were even trying to buy Katelyn drinks, a fun atmosphere to kick off the night! 

I've noticed Pesto's will host the occasional Paint and Sip night, would be a blast to get into one of these vs. going to the traditional studios. 

Nothing but the friendliest service on any of the many occasions we've been in. Andrew C. and I have been served by both Debbie and her son, Noah. It's a family ran business, and that shines through every time. 

Pesto's is an excellent option in this nook of Chandler. As long as the food is delicious, the wine is a flowin', and the service remains the same, I will ALWAYS be back for those weekend afternoon wine and wings sessions."}
{"text":"Great food and wine! We come here at least a few times a month."}
{"text":"We came here as a suggestion from a friend & loved it! It was such a nice atmosphere and the food was some of the best Italian food we've ever had. I ordered the ziti with chicken & it had so much flavor and was incredible! I did not expect to love the food as much as I did. Our server, Justin, was extremely helpful and friendly. Since it was our first visit, he gave us excellent recommendations for the wine and food and you could tell he was very knowledgable about the menu. I haven't had that great of a server in a while and he definitely made our experience even greater. I am excited to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Pesto's rocks the kazbah! It is a hot little spot in an armpit of a strip mall.  The wine bar is movin' and shakin' almost every night of the week. Forget, 98South, 56East, if you want to chat with a bunch of fun people about absolutely anything with a staff that is there to cater to your every wine desire, well, Pestos is great. 

The wine list is a treat to drink yourself through and should be on someone's - maybe mine - top 75 things to do list! As lovely as the wine list is, what truly is the cherry on this sweet slice are the bartenders. They are not shy about a generous pour, love a long chat about absolutely nothing and know absolutely everything about the wine they serve and love to share. What is not to like about this establishment....well, the food is just okay. Hey, its' Chandler. Wadda ya want? The pizza crust has  improved recently and well, the appetizers have never been anything to right home about.  Does the food detract, yes but just a little bit, hit the bar, serve yourself up a flight and turn to your neighbor and start chatting!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and Italian dishes at Pesto's. This little eatery has been here forever it seems like! We ate here for lunch, and noticed that their happy hour lasts for quite a long time, 12-6. That would definitely make someone very happy!

I decided on the spaghetti with meatballs ($13). It was a gigantic dish with one large meatball split in two, pasta, and copious amounts of red sauce. It tasted great, and the meatball was flavorful and tender. The lunch special included a salad and a drink, which meant I was definitely stuffed after eating here.

Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.

I'm glad I rediscovered this restaurant. It's definitely a good option for Italian if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Expensive. I don't mind paying money when I get something that is far and above better tasting then any other restaurant. In this case the price point is off a bit. Don't get me wrong aesthetically this restaurant looks nice, but the food wasn't better than any other pizza joint. I wasn't feeling the high tables either. I usually prefer places with booths. That is more comfortable to me. Pestos only has stall tables. Most of them are the high tables that I find uncomfortable. If you are willing to pay more solely for being is a good environment than so be it. I'm not though. I will pay for good food, but nothing here tasted that amazing. The food was good so that's a plus. This place will remain successful because there are people that only want to eat in environments like this restaurant provides, but just know that is what you are paying more for."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! My boyfriend and I don't go out too much, but when we do, we try to have the best experience possible. This place definitely gave us that. Not only was the atmosphere relaxing, but so was the staff. Our server was very knowledgeable on all of our questions he even got my boyfriend to try wine! And he's not a wine drinker at all. 

Towards the end of our meal the owner came by and gave me a rose, which was super sweet! He then cane by and took a portable picture of me us...we definitely felt special and very welcomed.

I recommend this to anyone who loves family owned businesses."}
{"text":"I had not been to Pesto's in a few years and found new items on the menu and a remodeled interior. I tried the Italian burger because I like unique entrees and our waiter Noah recommended it. It was simply one of the best burgers I've had in my life with a bit of sweetness (house made onion/balsamic/cane sugar jam), pancetta and a crisp, hearty house made bun. I was almost sad to finish it, it was so good! 

Noah was a friendly, attentive and relaxed server. He asked what brought us into the restaurant, answered my questions about menu items thoroughly, and made a point to provide more than the bare minimum of service, something I don't experience often. Having worked for three years in an Italian restaurant as a server myself, I cannot overstate how valuable such service is in generating returning and satisfied customers! 

So if you are looking for a locally owned and relaxed Italian restaurant with great staff and fresh food (and fantastic Italian espresso made skillfully on an authentic machine), I suggest Pesto's!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite awhile, but had no time to make dinner tonight so called ahead to get some takeout on my way home. Was told ready in 15 minutes. Perfect! I Showed up in 25 minutes and was offered a cup of water while I waited an additional 25 minutes for my food - with my 8 year-old son in tow. Meanwhile watching others come and go with their called-in orders. Was Never offered an explanation, and they would've let me leave without the extra salad I had paid for if I had not noticed it missing from the order. 

The food was good, but I can get good Italian takeout from a lot of places. I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"We love Pestos! Great neighborhood bar great drinks and we feel like family. Roxanne, Deb and Frank are so friendly. We have the Greek salad every time and normally try a dinner special which never disappoints! Love love the martinis they knock you on your ass. Extensive wine list that is very affordable. Pestos is a sure thing!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Pesto's and it was a fantastic experience. The service has very prompt and the entire staff seemed to work as a team. The food was great as well. We live in SE Gilbert so not near the house but if in the area I would certainly return."}
{"text":"I have been to Pesto's several times at different times of the day or night...I am so in love with it! The atmosphere, the food, the wine, the happy hour, the people! They have the most friendly servers/bartenders! It's adorable inside! The owner is so sweet and personable! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here on a Saturday night for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised that it was happy hour. We ordered the meatball sliders & calamari from the HH menu. The sliders are delicious but the calamari was a little rubbery. For my entrees, I ordered the mushroom ravioli with cream pesto sauce and my friend ordered the shrimp marinara. Both dishes were delicious. The ambiance was lovely. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences in Arizona!  We have now been there three times in the last three weeks since being introduced to this culinary gem.  The food is authentic and fresh with specials that are creative and interesting.  The drinks are served with gusto and the customer service and friendly faces are second to none.  This is officially our go-to spot!"}
{"text":"I have visited Pestos a few times and the food is always fantastic. Servers are friendly and it's a nice place to have a quiet meal. I am in love with the mushroom appetizer and the veggie pizza with palm hearts!"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite spot. We love going and getting their hot and dirty martini, it is hands down the best dirty martini I've had. I always get the best salad, a slice of pizza or the pasta Greek. The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place was our first food place on our trip across America. We shared a huge white pizza with sausage for dinner. It was pretty good. The ambiance was very relaxing and it looks like a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Noon to 6 happy hour?  Perfect!  Calamari was great just a touch of heat which we loved, meatball sliders were delicious and the bowl of pasta in the house sauce hit the spot.   Just great food would have been 4 stars, the bartender was great. His suggestions on the food were right on, he was attentive and always there when we needed him. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has been around for several years! I'm excited Yelp is now here to leave a review!! I went in here after grocery shopping one day to get a pizza to go, mind you I said to go! Plus they are located right by Fry's grocery store! I was informed they had a dress code! After I paid & was given my order. Had someone told me before I'm sure they knew I wouldn't have bothered to spend my money on their establishment! I was 9 months Prego in summer I wanted to grab something quick & go home. I was obviously dressed well enough to be in the grocery store shopping. (I'm not the person running around in my pj's) NEVER WENT BACK NEVER PLAN TO !!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I always have the linguini and white clam sauce and my kids love the meatballs and raviolis. The sauce is very good."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood Italian restaurant and wine bar.  We have been customers for more than 10 years.  Everything is homemade and the service is great.

The pizza is tasty, but I recommend the house specialties, like eggplant parm, linguine w/ clam sauce and others...  The homemade house salad dressing and marinara is very authentic.

Huge wine selection and cold beer!

Stay away from the big chain restaurants and go to Pestos....you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago and loved the place. It's a quite little place with the bar on the left and table to the right. We arrived in time for happy hour but just ended up getting a glass of wine. With I'd seen the calamari but there's always next time.

First we started with an appetizer. Decided to get the sampler which was well worth it. So delicious. After I had the clam pasta and husband had the pizza. Do yourself a favor and have the clam. It's fantastic! So traditional in the wine broth. It had a little spice to it but not enough to really call hot. It was a nice warm, subtle heat that only adds to the enjoyment. Husband loved the pizza. He's not a man of many words so I have no idea as to the chewiness of the crust or anything else but I'll say this, it looked like a good pizza. Not weighed down.

After we were finishing, we found out that our waiter was the owners son. It was lovely talking with him about his parents place and how the whole family is involved. Just gave the place an extra bump to know the love that goes into the food they create and serve. 
Big thumbs up for me."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. The food is incredible. They have the best Caesar dressing I've ever had. Be brave and try things you may not normally try. The eggplant pizza may not sound like something you'd normally try, but you'll love eggplant after eating this pizza. The eggplant rollatini is amazing. The lasagna is to die for. The ambience makes for a great date night or girls night. They have a really good happy hour. I love their wine flights and the owner is great about suggesting wines. I did not think I liked Cabernet before she introduced me to one. They have unique wines and are very knowledgeable about wines here. My only criticism on the food would be the garlic bread. It's on the dry side and it's not all that well seasoned. I would also say they need friendlier service. They are efficient but not as personable as a five star restaurant should be. That said, I will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was amazing! The Bacon Wrapped Dates, amazing. Meatball sliders, amazing.  Beer, amazing. Service, amazing.  And a good lookin' bunch too!"}
{"text":"I would like to say first that the place has good service and I know they are trying hard to create unique flavors in a strange location. Which is mildly being factored but, I have to be real and with giving a less than positive review I will give feedback that will improve it next time. 
According to YELP 3 stars means \"Yah I am a fan\" and I could not give them that 3
I came here with a couple friends and let a non foodie friend suggest this place because it was his Bday and he heard from friends it was good... 
We ordered :
$8 ish Sweet Potato Fries with Duck Confit- This was one of the things that I kinda liked even thought the duck was dry and was presented as an almost\" pulled pork style\" What really could of improved this would of been some type of dip of sauce to go with it. Something that might reflect a confit glaze with texture. 

$10 Bacon Dates- This is something that if you are going to serve Tapas style that you do right because it is standard on any Tapas menu. The bacon was soggy and falling off and the dates were really hardly stuffed. CRISPY BACON is is critical though for this dish. 

$12 Prosciutto and Melon- UGH it should been a red flag when they misspell it on the menu and when you ask the waiter all he can say is that people come here just for the dish but doesn't have any personal opinion. So on paper it sounds like an interesting dish and it could be possible delivered but, it is difficult to do. The dish here is served with bug chunk of melon of small prosciutto slices on top with Saba drizzled and feta scattered on the plate with a poached egg. All the ingredients I love but, if this was \"Chopped\" the judges would say that you just threw them all on the plate without really combining into flavor. The melon was too big and sweet with the minimal prosciutto and the saba/feta was more on the plate than on the dish while the egg just was hard to use for anything except by itself. How can you fix this??
1. longer thinner melon slices turn it more into a vessel while being able to add the prosciutto as true layer of same size.
2. I would try a qual egg which would fit perfectly
3. then drizzle the saba directly with a sprinkle of feta and it is all on their like a great umami finger food. 

$9 or $10- Pork Belly Mac and Cheese- The worst thing here by far and this really can be categorized as BAD overall! Alfredo noodles, runny Alfredo Sauce, under fried pork belly and cheese on top then bake it BOOM Mac and cheese!! Oh man I can't believe this actually made it to a menu without some type of vetting. It really was not mac and cheese because all the cheese was a sauce on the bottom of part of the baked cheese on top. The pork belly was cut really small and was just fatty and mushy without any real crisping or frying. This idea is good but, actually put work into it! Make a sauce with the noodles already in it. 

$18 Alfredo Pizza- Sausage, Spinach, Sun dried tomatoes and Alfredo sauce- Super cheesy if you like think really creamy cheesy flavor which is super 1 note. Could use more spice but, this is exactly what you order is what you got. So, I can't say to change it however the crust is not very crispy and hard to eat with hands. I had to knife and fork it. 

So overall I am not saying don't go here, food choices in Chandler are fairly limited and I assume if you are really into wine you can ignore my review since this is food related. I am just saying the food needs major improvement and the prices are set for something much more high end than what you are getting."}
{"text":"I go here anytime I come and visit from Ohio, the food is always great and the happy hour specials are a steal, especially if you just want a few small plates with your drinks. Great environment and great food, always friendly servers and bartenders. I highly recommend the fried calamari appetizer and pretty much any classic Italian entree."}
{"text":"They did remodel about a year ago. Nothing major, just some table and booth changes. The bar area is the same and the food is great. I have enjoyed the pizza, calizones, and alfredo. There are numerous Italian places within 2 miles, and they have survived and done well."}
{"text":"Wonderful locally owned place, no wonder it's survived 20 years! I have been here a few times over 10 years & forgot to check in. Feel bad I never wrote a review until now!

Happy hour is 3-6, Good drink deals. $5 house wines that don't suck, $4 Mich Ultras, & a GREAT list of $5 food items that definitely fills me up for \"dinner.\" However, CHECK OUT the specials... They are impressive, gourmet. 

Service is friendly, genuine. The owner Debbie is AMAZING, she CARES. Like a friends' place. Atmosphere is classy, relaxed elegance. There is background music playing, but you can have a conversation without raising your voice.

SLEEPER TIP: CHECK OUT the cocktails menu!! I've always ordered wine. Finally saw the cocktails list - these are NOT the boring cocktails. These are CRAFT. The owner made my Hibiscus Kick all fresh. I was SHOCKED at how delicious & balanced it is... I expected too sweet... I'M delightfully WRONG!

In a sea of chain restaurants, I LOVE this neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it might be shabby from the outside, but when you walk in it's a legit wine bar! Their mozzarella sticks are REALLY good, seriously I have never had mozzarella sticks that good before. I've had the Eggplant Parmesan rolls (or something like that), Pasta Greek and of course the Chicken pasta with pesto/alfredo sauce which were all flavorful and delicious! Portions are very generous; I end up always having leftovers! Their house wines are actually not too shabby either. I don't think you'll be finding any Liberty Creek here! It's really good, but can be a bit pricey, so you'll definitely want to make it a once-in-a-while thing. Still, it's really damn good!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for a date. 

We happened to get here at the right time because a few minutes later it was packed. 

For an app, we had the mini cheese plate. Very pleasantly surprised. The mini plate is large enough for two. 

I also had the white wine flight. Delightful. 

Dinner I had the ravioli - they were good. 

I would go back for sure. The service was friendly, only small complaint: drinks were slow, but not a deal breaker. I live in the neighborhood behind this shopping center and would love to have a wine night and walk home :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night as part of a large group.  Service was good.  I really liked my wife's pesto with shrimp.  I didn't care for my ziti with chicken.

On a funny note, my insane brother-in-law sent back his calzone since it had ricotta cheese....what kind of cheese was he expecting?!  The staff was very nice about it.

I do appreciate they were able to accommodate us on short notice.

I did try the tiramisu.  It was non-traditional, but still very good.

This looks like a nice place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good here. The lasagna is excellent. Service is great. I also like the quiet and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have My friend Tigearnan to thank for first introducing me to Pesto's.  Who knew it even existed with it's unassuming stripmall facade.   I was pleasantly surprised to meet Antonio, a superb bartender who makes you feel as if he invited you to his house for dinner and cocktails with 40 or so of his closest friends.  He mixes a mean martini and helps you make the best drink and eat choices to fit your mood.

The lighting is right, the food fresh and tasty and the staff bring it all together for a delightful evening of socializing and or just eating.  I'm crazy for their house Pesto Pizza and  fabulous Greek Salad.  All this for a great price.

It's a jewel in the East Valley you have to check it out."}
{"text":"While their happy hour is good ($5 wines by the glass) , and the food is passable, I was absolutely perplexed when they could not tell me the price of a bottle of a split of champange in their prominently displayed behind bar wine cooler. When I inquired with the manager he strangely acted like I was in his house saying \"did you ever think that there may be a reason it's not on the menu? Maybe it's part of a personal collection!\" It seemed odd, and completely devoid of any hospitality. I probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best calzone hands down and the pasta dishes are also delicious. The only downside is the noise level but it's worth it for the delicious food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!   So good went back the following week!   The atmosphere is great,  drinks are far from skimpy and the food is amazing!   The cracked crab Alfredo pizza is mouth watering.   Besides great pizza and Italian dishes,  Chef Chad's weekly specials are creative and delicious!  One of the best restaurants I've been to in Arizona!   Go!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their service has been hit and miss. The food has been outstanding for the most part. Tried the Tuscan and Cracked Crab Alfredo pizza. very good. Their prosciutto and melon was also outstanding.The sausage stuffed mushrooms are excellent appetizer bites. The goat cheese and pepper jelly lamb burger is great! The linguini & white clam sauce was sub par and bland. I like the wine bar ambiance and intimate lay out. It is on the more expensive side if you want to have wine or drinks, but if you know what is good, it is worth the price."}
{"text":"The moment we entered, we were greeted with a smile by the friendly hostess. Our waiter was extremely attentive as was the bus boy. The food was delicious. Great atmosphere. My bfs napkin fell on the floor and before he could even pick it up the hostess had a clean new one for him. We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best kept secret in Chandler! Amazing food, great service, and there is no place around with better food specials."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! It was a different experience right from the moment we were greeted by the owner herself who was very friendly and caring. Our waiter Will was amazing he was very informative and attentive with my family and I took the time to break down the menu and the most popular items since it was our first time. Got the prosciutto and melon appetizer salad it was amazing and big enough for 3 adults to share. Then ordered the lasagna which was to die for, the ziti with grilled chicken also amazing and the crab pizza which was my absolute favorite! Food was delicious and service was the best I've had in a while I will definitely be back for more!! Got a free cannoli since it was my birthday as well and I think I'll come back for my next birthday!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for a relaxing drink of wine and some great food as well. Love the owners involvement with this place. They keep things fresh and updated. Friendly is an understatement. Service is 100% great menu to choose from. Everything I try I like. Big on their Greek salad and gotta hit that meat lovers pizza one in awhile"}
{"text":"I love Pesto's and frequent here often! I love that its locally owned, quality food and has great decor.  Happy hour is a great deal too!  My favorite dish is the Eggplant Rollatini!  Chefs specials are amazing too.

Twice the owner gave me a carnation on my way out.  Great family running this place!"}
{"text":"I've been impressed each time I have been to Pesto's. This time they went out of their way to accommodate our party of 6 on a busy Friday even though we did not have a reservation.  We told them we were celebrating a special event and they made it happen. The selection of Happy Hour plates was great, flavorful and satisfying. The prices during Happy Hour meant we had lots to sample and share, ample wine, and a wonderful celebration. Thanks for your gracious hospitality! We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Interior very good and nice. Food.....not so much...
Pizza was okay for a pesto cheese....was just okay...hand toss style. Had the the eggplant bruchetta was okay...fried ravioli not so much. Stuffed mushroom not so much.....it is an mature crowd. Yea dont feel it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Delicious and authentic Italian food is created here...and that pesto...wow! A must try. Next time I'm getting pizza"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  They have everything!  Delicious house salads, specialty salads, pizza, delicious specials.  The best pizza place in town!"}
{"text":"I love Pestos! The owner Frank is a great guy and the food is awesome! I love the pesto Alfredo and the Alfredo pizza! Amazing Italian food and great service! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place looks a little plain from the outside but the interior is really nice, well decorated and very comfortable! 

They have an awesome wine selection and the food is really good! The eggplant appetizer was AWESOME. They have an extensive pizza menu as well as a lot of regular entrees.

If you live in chandler, Mesa or tempe I would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! I was planning a dinner for my family (party of 20) and they accommodated us so well. The staff was so nice and incredibly pleasant. The atmosphere was  warm and inviting. The wait staff was so attentive. They were amazing. If you have a large party I highly recommend them!!!!! Oh, and most importantly the food was amazing. Because our party was so big and we had so many different orders and I had my fork in each plate. The cracked crab pizza.....TO DIE FOR! The chicken pesto penne ....uh, AMAZING....Sambuco Chili wings were finger licking good! Lamb burger was grrrreat!. Happy hour was delicious!"}
{"text":"Pesto's is awesome! pizza is really good. i always ask to please make a little extra crispy:) it's usually a little to doughy if i don't say something. love the atmosphere, it's usually pretty busy. great selection of wines, they have beer too. i like getting a pizza to go usually. but if i have time it's nice to sit down. i recommend."}
{"text":"Very cute decor, unfortunately that was our best experience during a recent happy hour. House wine was room temp (Chardonnay), calamari was reheated and still not warm enough, and pizza was not even close to home made. Granted it was happy hour, but far from a level worth returning for. Service was good, specifically from the bus staff. Owner spent plenty of time with the regular customers but never made an attempt to acknowledge our presence."}
{"text":"I don't get out to Chandler much. But a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here. From the food to the service, everything could not have gone smoother. I heard they had recently remodeled the place. Well...bravo! Everything is tastefully decorated. Looks like a great place to get your happy hour on. There was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area. But it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like. I can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a Safeway.

The theme of the shower was wine and cocktails. The bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable. For our party, she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails. And the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper. The owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality. The owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom. So, I don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party. But judging by how nice she was, I'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment. And everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good. My favorite was a chocolate martini. The bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation. 

For the food, we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping, a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip. We also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms. And for pizza, we went with the pesto and Mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes, chicken and feta cheese). The pizzas were thin crust and piping hot. And the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency. It took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet. 

I was happy with the food and level of service. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I only wished I lived closer so I could visit Pesto's on a week day."}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped  in today for a glass of wine and appetizers.,it had been a while since we had been here and I had forgotten that they had done extensive remodeling. Wow! The decor is beautiful and this is NOT your average wine bar. They have an Extensive wine list, probably more than 40 wines by the glass, and very good appetizers. We arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday, the bar area was beautiful, with just a few customers before the Sat rush comes in to listen to the Jazz band. We each had wine flights, great wines, and our server, Will, was very knowledgable about the wines as well as very attentive! He did a great job suggesting the wine flights and various appetizers!  Great overall experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Over the last month, ordered pizza to go and dined in as well. I like this place. Nice decor, very nice cocktail bar, which is semi-separate from dining area.

The pizza is terrific. Medium thin crust, excellent sauce. Dining in ordered a pesto calzone--superb. The sauce is simmered with Italian sausage, even though meatless, it produces a sublime flavor. Calzone is lighter than doughy versions elsewhere.
Service was excellent.

Recommended for solid Italian fare and pizza or a couple pops in the nice cocktail bar."}
{"text":"Amazing as always!  Chef Chad's specials never cease to amaze, as well as the severs and owners.  Lobster Lasagne and Low Carb Meat Bowl were spectacular!  Great for a special occasion or just a regular evening meal. The Basil Mist and Black Cherry Manhattan are a must!"}
{"text":"Nice Spot to Gather and Enjoy Food and Wine

This friendly spot was worth the drive to meet, sip wine, and chat with a group of new and old friends. Service was fast and friendly, I enjoyed the wine offerings, and had a nice Caesar salad. My only concern was that my calamari came out barely warm and overly salty. It was perfectly fried, but apparently during that busy time they couldn't manage to get it to me still hot. If I lived closer I might be tempted to return to try the calamari under different circumstances. I didn't want to send it back that evening because they were so busy."}
{"text":"Waw!!! Is all you need to know. Me and my wife went there last Thursday looking for an Italian  bistro and we ended up on Pesto's. I ordered the lamb burger and her the eggplant something. I can honestly say i had never tasted better meat than that burger.  And I  have been all over. I highly recommend this place. The food is delicious and it is also a bar which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Wednesday lunch.
First time here, our server was Justin. Excellent interaction, gave good advice on menu. 
Started with iced tea and app Olives.
Got to tell you, those Olives were great!
Entree was 1/2 calzone and salad. Very nice, fresh mix of greens.
Calzone was tasty, had a light crisp outside, a little soggy on the inside, but good.
A little pricey, but good quality ingredients.
Very nice bistro interior. Clean, tasteful, comfortable.
I'll bring my wife here for dinner."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was!  Great wine list, terrific food and a totally awesome contemporary decor. The ambiance and lighting were perfect, and the space created a very relaxed, modern vibe, which was not at all what I was expecting from the outside. It's in a strip mall in a Fry's lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint, but it's totally chic and cool inside!!  

My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered. I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had, it was one of the best I've ever had. 

The wine flights are really great, you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes. The pours are generous, you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight. 

We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  great ambience, great food and great wine list.   More importantly, something I haven't found in abundance in the valley, excellent and friendly service.   check out thier daily happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the food and service is always great. They have a pretty good happy hour from noon till 6pm. We ordered calamari, bacon wrapped dates, Cesar salad, Greek salad, lasagna, and linguine with clam sauce. The calamari was well seasoned and the dipping sauce was also flavorful and really good. I didn't try the dates but others said it was a delicious combination with the dates and bacon and bleu cheese. The Greek salad is what I had and it was really good! Very fresh and colorful. The lasagna was good as usual and the linguine was good too. There was a good amount of clams in it but we didn't know it was going to be like a noodle soup like dish. Flavors we're all good and overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Excellent calamari probably some of the best I've ever had. I had the garlic spinach calzone and it was great, although too much garlic for my taste. I found the service to be very on point in every way. Food came out quick and hot. Sangria was great too. 
I went during happy hour and was a little surprised at the prices but felt like the value justified the price."}
{"text":"Pestos is my absolute favorite restaurant to introduce friends, neighbors, family and coworkers to. Each time I bring new customers in, they are blown away by the quality of food and the attentiveness of the staff. 

My absolute favorite on the menu is the Shrimp Scampi pizza. The combination was something I was very unfamiliar with when I first visited, but I took the advice of my friends and tried it... and it's now a favorite that I will drive 45 minutes one way to enjoy!! Absolutely worth the taste, especially if you love shrimp!

Another item that is a recurring item on the Specials menu is the Grilled Broccoli Caesar Salad. Never have I thought it was possible to make broccoli taste like a steak... word to the wise, just order it and TRY it!!! I love to see the reaction of my guest's faces when I give them a fork of the salad for them to try it... an instant favorite.

Of the 15 plus items I have tried and sampled on the menu, I have never found for even one of them to not absolutely blow me away with the quality, presentation and flavor.

For dessert, give the salted caramel gelato a try! Paired with the dark chocolate gelato, it makes for an amazing flavor combination. It can be difficult to find room for dessert after a huge meal, but it is sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious here! The staff were all great today too - helpful, friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. I LOVED that the bacon wrapped dates were on happy hour because my husband won't eat them so it's nice to get a smaller plate of them. The only thing that disappointed us was when we realized the bottle of wine we ordered was 3X the retail - I thought 2X was more the industry norm. But maybe this is because of the minimum wage crap."}
{"text":"yes I agree! Fellow NY-er here says this restaurant has some of the best NY pizza in town! They also catered my brother's rehearsal dinner and all the food was great. ( sausage and peppers- yummy!)

Update-6/25/11 - Walked in last night to catch Steve Benson spinning the CD's and drawing caricatures-hello? Not missing that gig. Me- \"Wow you remodeled the place\"  LIz- the wonderful, superstar waitress- \"Yeah, nine years ago\" -hahahaahahah! PWEEWWT!!!! I guess I have been eating mostly take out or catering from them over the last few years. LOL! The place looks beautiful and the food is outstanding. The owner is from Smithtown, NY and I love her and this place. Manga!

PS- Hello did I mention Steve Benson was there?- Again did I mention Steve Benson does first Friday's there? You can get a caricature done by none other than Steve Benson. Oops, I'm sorry did I mention Steve Benson is there once a month on Fridays Dj'-ing and drawing -(D and D-lol)  Being politically motivated/involved and an executive member of AEA I was in heaven! I love my teacher caricature! Check it out. Fun times!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Italian restaurant. Great food, wonderful atmosphere and a superb wine list. What sets really sets them apart is the service and staff. Friendly, fun and great place to learn about wine and wine pairing. I love bringing friends and family to Pesto's to enjoy a great evening together. 
Pesto's gets my highest recommendation!!!!
