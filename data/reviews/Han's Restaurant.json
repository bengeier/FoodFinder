{"text":"To my surprise this tiny restaurant is VERY busy during the lunch. If you don't get there before noon, you can pretty much forget getting a table. Hans serves both Taiwanese and Szechuan style chinese food.   I've been there on a couple of occasions for lunch. I would say the food is hit and miss as it completely depends on what you order. On my first visit there, I ordered the taiwanese beef noodle soup. It was delicious!  The slices of braised beef were very lean and tender. The soup was very flavourful. However, on the same occasion I ordered the seafood fried noodles. That dish was a disaster. The squid was mushy and overall the noodles were VERY bland.   On my second and third visits there, my coworkers and I ordered more traditional taiwanese and szechuan dishes. My favourite is the wontons with chili oil.  I also really enjoy a traditional taiwanese dish called \"Ants climbing tree\".   Of course, the dish doesn't contain real ants. It's basically a vermicelli dish with lots of chilies. I also like the spicy oxtail dish as well.  For me the dishes are very addictive because I really enjoy spicy food. If you decide to try Hans, you have to go there expecting an entirely different style of chinese food.  Most people have been exposed to cantonese style chinese food as that is what is most prevalent here.  It is very rare to find very authentic taiwanese and szechuan food in Calgary.  If you are expecting to find westernized chinese food (eg. ginger beef and pineapple chicken balls) this is not the place to go as they don't have any of those items on the menu."}
{"text":"I periodically crave for the delicious Szechuan dishes from this restaurant. The food tends to be on the oily side so we always request that they prepare the dishes with less oil and less salt/soy sauce. The owners are really nice and accommodating. I highly recommend the sliced pork with garlic sauce. The thin strips of pork belly were covered in a tangy, spicy, savory, and garlicy sauce over a bed of beansprouts. I always order the 3 cup chicken as well. The chicken is marinated really nicely so the meat is flavorful and you can really taste all the different ingredients especially the basil. I also recommend the eggplant with spicy sauce. Even with less oil it's still really oily but the flavors were really good so I keep going back for more. The sweet and sour fish filet has a thin crispy batter and the fish was still soft and flaky inside. The sauce smelled really sour but it nice and sweet as well."}

{"text":"First of all, if you struggle to find this place you're not alone. The address is 303 Centre St SE, but you'll find it inside a bigger building on 3 Ave SW right near the Centre St intersection. Follow the sandwich board arrows inside! The restaurant is the first on your right once you're inside.  The place is open from 11am - 8pm, with a specials list all under $10 on weekdays 2-6pm and Saturdays 11am - 6pm. I walked into an empty (tiny) restaurant at 5:30pm and asked for a spicy recommendation from their specials list. She suggested the Kongpao Chicken Combo, which is very popular. It was $8.75 + tax - I peeked and the usual menu item is $13.50.  My food was ready is less than 5 minutes and was pretty tasty! I had a generous serving of rice with chicken, onion, peppers and chilies. I was impressed with the chicken quality and the flavour given the price. Plus the veggies tasted fresh even though I don't see how they could have cooked it so quickly.  For dining in it's not much to see, just eight cheap wooden tables each with four chairs and their usual menu is all around the $15 mark. I'm not sure I'd ever dine in but I certainly see myself working my way through the specials list on future takeaway nights in."}
{"text":"It took us a bit of exploring to find this little spot, but definitely glad we made the effort. The food always tastes fresh and well prepared, and always accommodating to make our orders extra extra spicy as per request. Would suggest ordering take out as the restaurant is a bit small."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here since the change of ownership and I am so shocked at how dead the restaurant was (pretty dead the past few times I walked by too during the lunch rush).  The food still tastes pretty good and retained the same flavors as before, so I wonder if people are just not giving these new owners a chance? I sure hope traffic will pick up!"}
{"text":"Tasty, simple, affordable, clean, friendly, and authentic, what's not to like about Han's?  Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Super tasty and quick to serve. Veggies tasted very crisp and fresh. Great value in their pricing, and they take debit/credit in an area where many do not!  Staff are so kind; the waitress has excellent English skill and is always quick on refilling water.   Chef came out to say thanks for coming as I finished paying.  I am visiting CGY for a couple weeks, and wondered around the Center street area.   Accidentally found this little place. It's inside a little mall so as others have said it's tough to find.  It's not in the obvious mall across center street. It's on the other side.  Have to enter a little off the corner along third street.   I found out they are new owners, who took over from an elderly couple that apparently were legendary.  Ah well, the new owners obviously take good care in their dishes."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my family and a couple friends - 7 altogether in our party. I called a few hours ahead to make a reservation. The proprietor seemed to have trouble understanding my English over the phone, so I asked her if this was indeed a Taiwanese restaurant. She assured me it was, and so I switched to speaking Taiwanese (I lived in Taiwan for 7 years an am fluent in the language). From that point we communicated without any problems. We are from out of town and I was looking specifically for a Taiwanese restaurant. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the other reviews here were favorable, so we thought we'd give it a try.  The restaurant itself is small with no atmosphere or ambiance at all. However, the food was FANTASTIC!! It was authentically Taiwanese and so good. Even if you've not had Taiwanese food before, I would recommend this restaurant. The only bad news from tonight was learning that the owner is planning to retire this year, so not sure if it will close or continue under new ownership/management. BTW, you should be aware that they do not accept debit or credit cards. Cash only. That was a surprise to us, but fortunately we had enough to cover the meal."}
{"text":"Nice simple family style restaurant run by a young couple. The husband is the chef and the wife runs the front of the house. Very polite and accommodating. My mom likes their ??? and I found the rest of their dishes pretty good. They are from northern China Tianjing so do not expect to eat Cantonese dishes. I will come back"}
{"text":"In case you haven't heard, the original owner is back! The beef noodle is delicious as always. Customer service is top notch. They have really authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Best beef noodle soup in Cow Town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Han's today.  It wasn't very busy; only 2 other tables were occupied.  The waitress explaind to us that the restaurant had closed down for 2 months and was just reopened last week.  I can see that there is new floor and the tables and chairs are like those in the trendy restaurants.  They are more like barchairs and tables.    The food is Taiwanese so lots of chiilies.  I love it!  We ordered a pork appetizer dish with chilli oil and bean sprouts.  It was pretty good!  Not too spicy for me but my friend coughed for a bit as the chilli got to her!  It's all good!  The other dish we ordered is the Beef Chow Mein and Vegetables - it comes with beef, cabbage, sliced black fungus.  The noodles were good.  I just wish we had bowls instead of the little plates to eat off.  The waitress brought me the hot sauce and she brought me 2 kinds - one of sambal oelek kind and the other is their chilli oil that they make inhouse.  The chilli oil was pretty good!  Cash only.  Will be back to try other Taiwanese dishes!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourites for szechuan food in the city.  My signature favourites are the pork with garlic sauce, spicy fish hotpot, green beans with minced pork, kung pao chicken and the spicy bean noodles. If you enjoy authentic spicy chinese food, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Mei and Han have retired and have passed the baton to new owners who, I discovered today, are from Tianjin, near Beijing. Han's has, needless to say, been a favourite of ours for years and a couple of past attempts at retirement and handover went so poorly that Mei and Han had to take the restaurant back. Today, we ordered our favourites (chicken with spicy sauce and the fried green beans) along with a cold celery dish that sounded interesting. I'm happy and relieved to report that it was all superb... amazing actually. The simple celery dish was magnificent; made with extreme care, blanched and tender but not close to mushy with a simple dressing of light soy sauce and sesame oil, I think. Delicious. The hot mains were absolutely stunning- we ate every bite and enjoyed them all. Service was very friendly if a bit slow because three parties, us among them, showed up at the same time, but it was very much worth the wait. Such a fantastic meal.  Han's is also and finally not cash only!"}
{"text":"Spicy Alert! - Hans serves both Taiwanese and Szechuan style chinese food. I have been going to Hann's with a group of friends since 2007, we normally order the following: 1-Fish Hot pot 2-Wonton with spicy sauce  3-Egplant with spicy sauce 4-Deep fried beans Always good and predictable, Hann's is a gem ! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I were looking for a good place for Chinese lunch. We were sick of all the large dim sum places with bland food. One of my colleagued lived in China and swore this was authentic. The food was phenomenal and portions are huge. Our table of 5 ordered 4 entrees and that was more than enough. I'm not sure why so many people are having problems finding it, we found it right away on google maps. It's inside a Chinese mall at corner of 3rd Ave & Centre St NW."}
{"text":"Han's is probably the best Chinese food I've had in the city. Small, family run business.  Wontons in chili sauce, eggplant, green beans and minced pork, dandan noodles, their spicy chicken dish... it's all excellent."}
{"text":"great food..the spicy chicken was a hit and so was the salt and pepper fish.  defintely worth a repeat!"}
