{"text":"Food is delicious and the owner is very friendly! I will come back for sure. I had the chicken shawarma platter and it was a lot of great tasting food for a good price. Make sure to ask for Tahini sauce!"}
{"text":"Ordered the kafta kabob and chicken kabob. Both were really tasty! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch! Friendly service and delicious food! Can't go wrong with a kebob :)"}
{"text":"Welcoming host, chef and owner prepared a custom order of mixed kababs for me. Having eaten Chaplee Kababs in NW Pakistan, I wasn't the same but probably healthier - it was less greasy and packed more meat than flour. I would say I tasted more Mediterranean flavors in the other Kababs than Afghan (which is how I had searched and found it on Yelp). Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try and we weren't disappointed. The food tastes good, and what made it better was the really friendly owner. One man team."}
{"text":"AMAZING Kabobs! Haven't had kabobs like these in a while. 

I love these places that have good food, friendly service, yet don't charge a gazillion. 

The one downside of this place is it's more of a fast food joint than a sit-down restuarant, but there are places to sit down too. So go here for the good food, but not necessarily a place to be wined and dined."}
{"text":"I go there at least once a week, they offer great kabobs along with very delicious afghan bread."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is so good and I suggest everyone to go an try it! It's a small hidden gem in Calgary that most would walk or drive by but I am glad I stopped in the food isn't to spicy which I like and the rice is plain and it's good for someone like me who suffers from ibs! Suggest everyone to go and give it a try nice staff as well! And good food for the price ."}
{"text":"The owner is amazing and really takes pride in his work. You are always greeted and the servings are HUGE. I could not finish an entire meal in one sitting."}
{"text":"Surprised I had not checked this place out yet while I was walking my pup I scurried back after dropping him off. There were a bunch of happy kids playing after some bday cake and I was warmly greeted. They took time in making my Donair and did not slap it together by any means. All of the add-ons looked very fresh and prepared with care. After bagging it the attendant threw in a small free pastry and it was scrumptious! Since I hadn't been here before I wasn't sure what they had for sauce selection and I was offered hot sauce, garlic sauce, tahini sauce, AND sweet sauce. Next time I will know better because I ended up getting 3/4 not knowing there was going to be more options hahaha. Will be returning to try the other authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Been to 14 other places before I found this.

Think I've been back 9 times.

Honestly the best shwarma in Calgary.

Friendly service massive bonus too!"}
{"text":"Delicious Afghan \"Fast Food\" Style.
Decided To Try This Place And The Food Was Absolutely Delicious. 

I Ordered The Kofta Kabob Entree Which Came With Real Afghan Rice (Not The Cheap Basmati Rice) But Long Grain Afghan Rice Which Had A Nice Seasoning In It As Well Came With Afghan Naan, Salad And Dal Nakhut. The Amount Of Food You Get Is So Worth The Price!.. I Couldn't Finish Half Of It And Saved It For Later.

The Man At The Counter Was Friendly. Takes A Little Time To Get Your Food But It's Because They Make It Fresh. I Would Rather Have Good Quality Food And Wait Than Have Pre Made And Fast.

I Will Definitely Will Be Going There Again And Try The Spicy Burger!"}
{"text":"This place is slow.    30 Minutes for a donair and falafel wrap!  It is the worst tasting place in Calgary.   Eat here if you like crappy food and to die of old age  before you  get it food."}
{"text":"We live in an area where there a lot of Afgan restaurants and I would rate this restaurant as good. The mixed wrap was ok and the lamb plate was very flavorful. Parking was difficult. The parking lot was full with no custimers in the the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They served hot tea even though it was not on the menu. We were missing kabobs and this restaurant met the need. The washrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Went there last week for the first time. I got three kebab's, rice, bread, fries, soup and a drink for approx. $20

For the amount of food I got I thought it was a great deal and I ended up having to get a take out box as I couldn't finish it.

The food was super tasty and fresh cooked, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Good is excellent prices are great. The owner really cares about his product and puts effort into every meal he delivers."}
{"text":"We eat here periodically. The food is good and price is right. Occasionally get a free desert. It can be a little slow to get a few gyros/pitas to go but not a big issue.

Parking can be tricky. We normally park in the back of the McDonald's parking lot and walk around the corner."}
{"text":"Ali Baba is located in the busy downtown Calgary on the intersection of 16 and 14 st, so chances of missing it are very less. It has private parking for few cars and street parking is close. 
It offers a choice of platters from Chicken Kebab, Beef kebab, Chaplee kebab, Shawarma, Donair and falafel all served with side of rice, fries, bread and salad. It also has wraps. Dessert is baklava.
I ordered Chicken Kebab platter on the spicy side. The chicken was soft and well done, I also noticed them checking temperature before putting on the plate. It was served with rice, some lentils, salad and raita. I could feel the aroma of fresh grill in my mouth. I would like to comeback next time and try shawarma."}
{"text":"So I love how Calgary has enough falafel/donair/kabob type eating places that there is a healthy amount of competition.  My wife and I tried a chicken shawarma and a falafel at Ali Baba.  Both were very tasty and excellent!  We visited the shop mid afternoon and our dishes took some time to prepare - but I saw them deep frying fresh chickpea balls and the sandwiches were grilled perfectly and such efforts take time.

I am kind of a geek about checking out how clean the prep table and kitchen are - and this is an open kitchen type shop... the food prep areas were clean and all of those the ingredients looked fresh.

I also like how the people working here did not have to write down my order yet the got it right.

I will definitely be back to this shop to explore some of their other menu items!

I have returned twice since I wrote this review and the food is very consistent.  And I love supporting a good family run business."}
{"text":"There's nothing like walking into a place and seeing three different kinds of meat rotating on a stick. Oh yes, Ali Baba's is one of *those* places and it's now my new favourite for shawarma (bakery counter included).

If you've ever heard me talk about meat, you'll know I love lamb. Those fuzzy little critters are just too tasty for their own good. It should come as no surprise that I came out of Ali Baba's with lamb shawarma. Of equally no surprise should be that I also had to satisfy my sweet tooth with some baklava (did you know they make three different kinds?).

The shawarma comes in two sizes-medium or large. Medium was plenty big enough for me. I could definitely go for another one of those soon. The baklava I had came in a little roll. It was pretty good, but then I've been spoiled when it comes to baklava.

Bonus: Ali Baba's is open late every night, and until 4 am on the weekends.

Tip: Don't be fooled by the cash machine in front of the register. They do take debit."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 8pm on a Saturday night. We were hungry and ordered platters. It came with rice, salad, bread and 2 skewers of meat- 1 beef and 1 chicken. The ground beef skewer was spicy and very tasty. The chicken was not as flavourful but still good. Hubby had the chaplee which was spicy ground beef patties. They were huge. We ended up taking the rice home and it was enough for 2 people. 

There's not much seating in this place and parking is slim.  This is a solid place to go if you're hungry on a late night out but don't expect service. You order at the counter, pay then they call you to get your food. Overall, we knew what to expect thanks to fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Alibaba serves Afghan food (chaplee kabob and so forth, with excellent, excellent rice) as well as donair and shawarma and even some western items (burgers); it has undergone at least one change in ownership and I think that it's now really firing on all cylinders. Today I got my usual which is the chaplee kabob plate, spicy minced beef patties with that excellent rice, and I also got something I've never bought there, a chicken shawarma for my partner.

The chaplee was as good as always and a big serving, but what really astounded me was how DELICIOUS the shawarma was. They use the big square sheets of pita that crisp up so beautifully in the sandwich press, the chicken was fantastically seasoned and they have this creamy spicy sauce, like a spicy mayo, that brings it all together. It is fantastic- I'll never go back to overpriced and underseasoned Shawarma Knight up the street now. That shawarma was massive and $8.99- I'm in love again :)"}
{"text":"Decent food but poor service. Had the owner chew me out because I used Skip The Dishes to make my pick-up order. He hated that we had to give them a cut, got angry at me that I didn't phone directly to make my order, and said he's giving me less food to make up for the cut that Skip The Dishes takes from him."}
{"text":"We tried donair sandwich and the lamb tikka kebab with rice. I liked the rice, and nothing wrong with the kebab. If I go again, and I would, I will not overfill the pita bread with lots of stuff. I tried lots of toppings and ended up with massive sandwich and a bit messy :). Still it was fine.

The gentleman with his wife were very kind."}
