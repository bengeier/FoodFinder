{"text":"What kind of self-respecting sushi place doesn't have wasabi?  Perhaps they forgot to add it to my order, but by the time I sat down and spread out all my stuff at a food court table, it was too much of a hassle to go back and ask.  And I know they certainly didn't have it at the condiment/cutlery bar.  I had a salmon and avocado roll, and the size of the fillings was not consistent throughout the roll. A couple pieces were missing avocado altogether.  However, at least it was not as rice-y as other supermarket and food court sushi."}
{"text":"Well, pre-packaged take out sushi is what it is...  but for whatever reason, I find myself visiting this little kiosk every couple of weeks or so.    Perhaps it's the random experimentation that they do, because certainly variety is their forte.  Random offerings of maybe wild rice rolls (which meant grainy texture... scratch that)... to the decadent deep fried onions on top of the rolls... to what the f@ck, but that looks like trying rolls ...   Why not?  Whatever it is, they have stacks of it, and employees continuously are stocking stacks more as soon as anything gets low.    The lineup in a sea of LONG food court lineups goes quickly, because the ass-hats in front of you have no real opportunity to stall the process.  No special orders.  No detailed questions.  Shut up, grab it, and pay.     I like speed, and efficiency.     Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012 - 29/30"}
{"text":"Even for mall sushi, this was very bad.  The discount near closing time was good and the service was friendly, but I couldn't finish the sushi since it didn't taste good at all."}
{"text":"It's all about the sushi. And specifically for me the salmon avocado sushi with the spicy mayo goodness on top, which I now have most days for lunch. On good days there's even a brown rice option. Today was a good day.  The first time I went here I tried one of their Teriyaki bowls. If it's a cold day and you want something warm, walk away. This was the worst 'teriyaki' anything I've ever eaten.  There's a good range of sushi and even on days when I've had a late lunch (1pm-ish) there's still been a decent selection. It's all made fresh that day, and the salmon avocado option has 9 pieces for $7.99 (plus tax). The sushi comes with ginger, wasabi and a soy sauce already packed in, with chopsticks and more soy sauce packets etc next to the till that you can help yourself to. I've even asked for extra wasabi before and been given a plastic container free of charge (before I realised there was some already in there).  Remember the golden rule: sushi yes, teriyaki no, and you'll do just fine here."}
{"text":"While traveling Canada we found quick lunch place in a mall. Soup noodle was very good with traditional Japanese style. Sushi also was acceptable considering price. I think this place is Traditional Japanese food in quick take out service and this kind of restaurant is hard to find nowadays with good quality like this one."}
{"text":"really nice sushi with very good quality. staff is friendly and extremely helpful. great sushi for a rather low price. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"For a big city, there are really not a lot of sushi places in downtown Calgary (but there are lots of Tim Hortons locations - don't get me started!)     Since the unfortunate fire at Sushi Hiro (and again, who expects a fire in a place that serves raw fish?), I have been looking for a place to sate my appetite for tekka and wasabi... and this is the place I have settled on.  Previously located in an island-like kiosk in the centre of the Scotia Centre food court floor, they have since relocated to a hip and very mod kiosk on the side.  While it is still not restaurant-level sushi, it is probably the best food-court sushi I've had in Calgary.  Their spicy salmon and tuna rolls are pretty good, and they have a good selection for sushi newbies too (if your definition of sushi does not extend beyond California rolls).  Is run by a truly charming woman with a wonderful smile and excellent marketing skills, her sincere charm will keep you coming back (plus she's cute!)  In my \"dream Calgary\", we will someday have at least one good \"corner sushi bar\" at least every two blocks in downtown Calgary.  But until that happens, places like Bento  Zushi will have to fill the gap. Recommended."}
