{"text":"Here sushi equates to much ice-cold rice with very skimpy bits of fish on top. Had to ask waitress for wasabi and ginger and given inadequate amount. Salad floating in dressing, bland miso soup.  Slow service.  A year or two ago one could get a decent lunch here."}
{"text":"When I feel like sushi, I feel like new generation  best all you can eat sushi place in downtown Toronto. I love the garlic/Jalapeno shrimps, the seafood salad, the selection of sushi, sashimi and rolls Fast service and really helpful. the only cons of this place is the Godzilla, it has huge hips Lol"}
{"text":"It was a couple months ago that I dined here, but I distinctly remember it being some of the worst sushi I've had.   The sushi tasted like someone decided to steam some unseasoned chicken and wrap it with plain white rice. I couldn't taste any vinegar on the rice at all. Also, if I remember correctly, it was not structurally sound and falls apart as you touch it.  I believe I also tried some Udon on this visit. I don't have terrible memories of it, so I'd suggest that over the sushi. I'm sure some of the other dishes are all right, but avoid the sushi.  That said, the prices were very reasonable, but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've had a very up and down experience with this restaurant. Blog TO recommended it as one of Toronto's best sushi spots so I was quick to try them out. The first few times I was in love, they were very affordable and very yummy. I even started recommending them to people. The past three times I went though, ruined my entire experience with this restaurant. One time, I went there at around 9 on a weekday, it wasn't very busy and we ordered as soon as we came in. 40 minutes later our food was nowhere to be seen and a waitress came up to us asking if we had ordered. They had totally forgotten our order and didn't even check up on us for an entire 40 mins to realize it.  We were pretty upset about the experience but deemed it as a one off and went again a month or so later. That time the service was slow again but not too bad.  What ruined it for me was the other night when we went back to New Gen.  Our waitress had obvious troubles communicating with me and completely messed up our order - when the food arrived I quickly told her it wasn't what I had ordered and her confusion led her to call the manager to talk with me instead. The manager was rude and instead of apologizing for the mistake, laid the blame on us and was very aggressive.  When it came to the bill, they attempted billing us for their mistakes twice, and didn't apologize once about the bad service we received.  We left feeling angry at the horrible service and it ruined our night.  Definitely never going near that place again and recommending that everyone else stays clear of their terrible service and rude waitresses/manager."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and the quality is definitely going downhill quick.  First off: What is WITH their rice? its mushy and feels more like oatmeal in your mouth than rice! I ordered a spicy butterfish roll and guess what- my fish wasn't even spicy and had no mayo on it to be found. BUT if you want extra spicy mayo? You can pay an additional dollar for that.... even though the roll I ordered had the word \"spicy\" in front of it, they put ZERO spicy mayo on it.  They also charge a dollar for a cup of green tea, so watch out - they won't warn you until you see it on your bill, but they DO make sure to offer it to you every 30 seconds! (it used to be free)  Secondly: Why is it that every time I want to do basically anything, ask for anything or want something on the side its an extra dollar? Most sushi places offer it complimentary - its to the point that if you want two of the SAME roll in a combo they charge you a dollar extra. Why? I'm getting the same amount of fish... what logic is there behind that?   After today's experience, I can safely say I'm not going to go back again. Just feel ripped off when I leave this place every time - and am ALWAYS hungry after my meal is over!"}
{"text":"A $30 minimum delivery charge plus $2 fee?! Lame."}
{"text":"Service is fast, prices are cheap and you have a wide variety of combos to choose from.  I chose the any 2 rolls with miso soup and a salad for $7. The food is OK for what you pay and very filling."}
{"text":"This is regularly voted of the best places to get sushi in the city. It's very popular with local residents so there are often lineups at peak hours. Extremely fresh food, reasonable prices, friendly service, and open till 2am every day. Also offers delivery!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years. In my opinion, this is the best sushi restaurant in the general area when considering all factors. Meaning, it does not necessary have the best sushi in town, or the best prices or service, but it provides the best experience overall, with no disappointments in ANY department.   I'm talking about: Food quality (especially the fish) Selection and menu diversity Cleanliness of dining area & restrooms Location & hours Price Great lunch specials Service (speed and quality) Speed and accuracy of delivery Consistency of all of the above  Because of these things, I know that new gen is waiting as my go-to whenever I want a no-hassle sushi experience.  Personal favourite: crunchy roll."}
{"text":"This place is the solution to our sushi addiction. They have great combos, comfortable sit down restaurant or takeout, very courteous staff, and are open anytime you crave some sushi (until 2 am). Meal combos come with a soup, salad and ice-cream of your choice. The salad dressing is the best I've tasted among sushi restaurants. If you would like all you can eat just go down the road to their AYCE branch. Lunch combos are special price and really cheap. A special mention to the attentiveness and courteousness of the staff, we enjoy tipping them for their wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Always ordered delivery from this place - the minimum amount of 20 dollars pre-taxed for delivery is quite something for one person, but the portions and quality of food make up for the price.  Ume box is definitely the best value for a hungry student - for 9 dollars you get a terriyaki rice AND 6 maki rolls AND numerous tempuras AND 2 gyozas, along with miso soup and salad. That's almost like two meals!  I also enjoy the spicy salmon rolls - the green onion and tempura bits make a great symphony with the spicy mayo sauce."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner about 3 weeks ago based on a suggestion by a friend who is a regular here.  Ambience-busy, but not cramped, casual dining atmosphere Quality of Food-Decent, but I've had better Japanese food elsewhere. I guess people come here for the value  Quantity-Good decent portions Value-Good value for the portion you get. Service- fast and good.  Summary- I would skip this restaurant if you're looking for very good Japanese food. If you're looking for cheap yet decent Japanese food, this may do, but I would sooner go to Ho Su on Queen West."}
{"text":"Easily the best cheapest sushi out there. I try to get there between 11 and 5, when their lunch special is $6.99 for 16 rolls of sushi (plus salad, tea and soup). Even if it's a late night grab, it's still so well priced. You won't find anything that beats it."}
{"text":"Freshness fluctuates to the point where I don't want to risk a \"bad day\" and I never go here anymore.  Sorry, but this place isn't good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this sushi restaurant! It was the first one I've tried in Toronto and I'll definitely go back. The prices were on point and the sushi was delicious. You receive a complimentary miso soup and a salad as well as a scoop of their fresh ice cream. I ordered the edamame and fried yams as an appetizer and they were so good I accidentally filled up on them before dinner. The phili roll and mango fusion were both perfectly made and easy to eat."}
{"text":"I went last night with my bf and father to New Gen Sushi.  Here's why I liked it:  1.  Great options on the menu to choose from.  2.  Cheap and it is easy to get different meals that satisfy everyone.  3.  I like the fact that everyone get free ice cream after their meal!  Here's what I didn't like:  1.  The service is poor and the wait staff does not fully comprehend what you are saying when you order.  They forgot one of our meals last night.    2.  Although the selection is large, you don't really get a lot of sushi in terms of portions.  3.  I am still not convinced that the place is entirely clean.  I think you can do better with sushi somewhere else, but hey, it fills the belly!"}
{"text":"For sashimi, this is a great place. Large cuts of fish that are so generous you don't need rice. I recommend the Ruby Sashimi Plate (They added an extra piece or salmon!) for $13.95. It comes with a miso soup and salad. I will definitely take my friends here."}
{"text":"New generation is another one of my favourite sushi spots - i love coming by this place after a late movie,  the selection is good, the quality is nice, yes its always busy and theres a line up most of the times ive come by but overall its just a nice place to have some good sushi  the service is friendly and they check up on you quite a bit, and yes they throw in freebies all the time, soup, ice cream,  this place is better than sushi on bloor, take my word for it!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price, but the rice is kind of poor. I didn't try any of the cooked dishes so I can't comment on that.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here! The sushi isnt that great... More rice then fish for the spicy tuna. The sushi combo was sloppy and squished together in a container. But it was tasty... The reason i say do Not order from here is because the delivery guy actually came into my apartment when i opened the door. After paying, he stood there and made me feel uncomfortable. I asked if everything was ok and he said thats not enough tip. I was shocked and kinda scared.   DO NOT ORDER."}
{"text":"I must have eaten here 200 times and it is always amazing! The servers are shy but sweet, the main chef is really nice too. You can't go wrong with a 6.99 lunch special, and their extended hours are also great. This is the best sushi place in the Annex, by far!"}
{"text":"Hey guys and gals!  Here's the down low on this Sushi place.   First off, the selection in terms of variety is as wide as it's going to get. Ranging from Beef Tataki, to Edamame, to Dragon rolls, to udon to soft shell crab! You can pretty much order anything that is even remotely Japanese.  Second, the quality of the food is consistently at a high level. I am not necessarily a picky eater when I am hungry, especially after I have just finished a 13 - 14 hr training session for my triathlon. But the great thing about this place is that even if I am hungry, or if I am not, the food is always good, always fresh and always brought to me within seconds. I recommend the Salmon roses, the Salmon set and the spider rolls!!  Third, the price of the place is relatively cheap. I eat like a monster but can still walk away full as if I just had an all you can buffet :D When I brought my (now) girlfriend here for our first date, I wasn't exactly a gentleman and ate like a pig. To my surprise she ate almost as much as me and we scared all the chefs and waitresses (who we are all friends now) lol! But between the two of us, the bill only came up to $70 which was amazing considering we ate the equivalent of what the the average North American consumes in one day (not even kidding, I am a personal trainer and I calculated the total calories to be almost 3000 LOL).  And ever since that night me and my girlfriend have gone back on a consistent basis, always greeted with a smile, hugs and FOOD!!  Hope that helps you out! (Especially those of you guys out there trying to woo a girl ;))  Happy eating everyone!  ZC"}
{"text":"Its a convenient location close to Spadina or Bathurst Station. This place is open late (2AM). The service is very quick and attentive. The menu choice is quite extensive. Its not too expensive and the price is quite good for the location.  Ordered some maki rolls since we were hungry and two orders of sushi. Got the Tobi-Zura which is flying fish roe with quail egg. Its a nice experience, but really not much going besides the presentation of this dish. We also got the Uni sushi. If you're a fan of creamy light sweet taste, then this is for you. And for the price its good.  Got the spicy tuna roll (lots of rice). It was okay.  Got the Oyster roll with tobiko. This tasted pretty nice for a first time. Got the Canadian Roll (lobster claw meat with cucumber, asparagus and mayo and smoked salmon). This was alright, but a little bland. Got the Spicy scallop roll. This is bland taste, but we like scallops, so its fine. Got the Fusion roll which is the most tasty roll out of all. Its a california roll integrated with torched fish on top with some light soya sauce and green onion. - The taste of this dish is definitely highlighted with the torched fish on top of the roll and a little with the sauce. And its ($9) so its pretty fair for 8 pieces as well.  All this came to $60 with tax and tips for two ppl. You get complimentary salad and miso soup and ice cream at the end.  Would go here, b/c there's many options and its open very late!"}
{"text":"Around 11.45 pm on a Monday night, I was gripped by a sudden and strong craving for some miso soup & sashimi.  Being lucky enough to live on the edge of the Annex, I high-tailed it to New Gen, the only Sushi place in the area that is open at midnight. (until 2 actually)  Strollong in at 12.30, I found an empty dining room with only one other group and grabbed a whole booth to myself, relishing the prospect of a having a quiet snack.  Let me make it clear that I am not an expert at sushi. My tastes lean heavily to the Izakaya side of Japanese cuisine. That being said, I did find the prices to be a little on the higher side.  I ordered the following: - Sashimi Ruby: 3 pieces each of Tuna, Salmon, Tai & Hokkigai with Salad and Soup - Asparagus Beef Maki  The dishes came out in a very haphazard manner, with my main dish of the sashimi coming first (along with the salad& soup), and the beef appetizer following shortly behind.   Salad: Doused in a sweet creamy Mayo based dressing, this was uninspired to be generous. Nothing to remember, but it served it's purpose I guess.  Soup: regular old white miso soup with Tofu & Seaweed. Well made but nothing special.   Sashimi: The Tuna & Salmon looked a little worse for wear, but tasted okay. Ti & Hokkigai were interesting choices that one doesn't usually see. Overall, I was very happy with the plate. My only quibble is the tiny pinch of Wasabi and ginger. I'll be honest, sometimes Wasabi & ginger are the only reasons I eat Sushi. For the prices being charged, they can definitely be more generous here.   Beef: not good. The paper thin beef, was absolutely smothered in a sickly sweet teriyaki glaze that drowned any flavour. Would not order this again.   Overall, this satisfied my late night sashimi craving and if I am in that situation again, i'll be back. But not if I have other options.  The total cost was about $20 without tip."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and service is good. However, I didn't find the menu was particularly inspiring, I have eaten far better sushi in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Allways good food here. They missed one star cause food is little pricey here. I can say they serve the best salmon sashimi i have ever had."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, great location and open to 2am. What's not to love? Efficient service, and it's almost always busy. It's a small space and they do their very best to accommodate all their guest. I eat here once a week. My only pet peeve about the place actually is the idiot customers who complain about how they don't have enough room. As if that's something the restaurant can actually fix on the already jam packed Bloor strip. Lol. Seriously, if you go during the dinner rush, expect to wait or grab a less desirable table. The price point and quality are pretty well matched and you should be happy with what they are providing. I know I am!"}
{"text":"When I attended my first year of University from Vancouver, needless to say, I was homesick. Searching for a somewhat decent sushi place, my floor mate suggested New Gen.   If you're a student and want to go for a bit of a splurge, New Gen is the place to go. Nice atmosphere, and a bustling crowd was what I first saw:  a comfortable scene.   Toronto's sushi scene specializes in the different kinds of rolls, but not so much on the freshness of the sashimi. I'm a big Salmon fan, so by far my favourite is the Spicy salmon maki. Tempura bits, salmon, and spicy mayo: the perfect bite every time. I must say that its salmon sushi set is also a bargain. The after meal free ice-cream is definitely a nice touch.   The salad I'm not so crazy about but the miso soup is always good."}
{"text":"This place is DOPE. The best AYCE sushi place in the city. It's a little on the expensive side but totally worth it. Show up starving and stuff your stupid face.  Apparently there's a regular menu too but who cares.   If you're still reading this you should just go there.  Stop reading; go."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I'm sad to say that I'm probably never going to visit New Generation ever again, even if I've been coming for over a decade. The quality has gone down a lot, portions are smaller, and they charge for tea now too. It's been a good run."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   I should mention that my reviews for Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi are identical, as, after many visits to each, I find they are beans from the same edamame pod.  There's much to say about Sushi. It's raw fish on rice, and it must be prepared by hand and with care. That helps justify the expense, even though it's customary in our society to equate \"value\" with \"man, I'm full.\"  Which is why places like Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi continue to be overflowing success stories. They provide the same ample feeling you might expect for $15 at any bistro, pub, or family restaurant, but, under the cover of \"sushi\" the average consumer feels that they had a healthy meal, or that they've experienced something avant garde.  The sushi at this restaurant barely has any taste, except for a hint of the saran wrap it sits in before a chef slaps it on some rice, and/or in a box, and on your table. Let's be frank: most Bloor Street consumers drench the rice in soy sauce and wasabe paste anyway.  The fish here is barely distinguishable. They make some extremely tasty special rolls ($10) but these tend to use cream cheese, avocado, tempura, or other filler that, again, makes the fish indistinguishable.  So it's hard to rate this place other than to say: expect a wait, you won't pay too much if you order smartly, and you'll probably get tea at the beginning and ice cream at the end.  3 stars"}
{"text":"With so many sushi places in the Annex, sometimes it's hard for me to keep them all straight.  But I have to say that I have the biggest love for this little place.  I've spent so many great meals talking with friends in this cozy, steamy restaurant that going to New Gen is almost a default option for dinner.  Hard core sushi eaters will be impressed by the array of options available to them.  Those of us who veer closer to bento eating territory will also find plenty of menu items to suit their appetites.  I'm especially fond of their array of appetizer choices, including their \"mega salad\" - one of my favorites, which has avocado, tofu, grape tomatoes and their tasty salad dressing.  Their miso soup is also delicious, and when I crave a good hot (fast) bowl of miso, this is the first place I head to.  Soup and ice cream are also free of charge with your meal, so don't be alarmed when it comes without prompting.  Of course, if you show up to close to the dinner rush, you will often encounter a line out the front door.  New Gen also offers my very favorite Annex lunch special.  With a huge amount of combo choices, each lunch special item comes in a sort of mini-bento serving - miso soup, salad and usually some sort of side, plus whatever your main meal is.  My favorite (and nearly inevitable) choice is the chicken katsu combo, although there are many others to choose from including some udon and less common lunch menu items.  Because of that never ending line, service is kept prompt and tactical in nature.  If you order a lot of items to share with a few people try not to be overwhelmed when they all come out within minutes of each other.  If you are still feeling the need to chat with your friends once you pay, my suggestion would be to move on to Futures for a coffee or face the antsy servers trying to get your table clear.  But overall the staff is very kind and helpful if you've got questions about the food or are looking for suggestions.  Overall it's a great quick meal if you're looking to go out with friends afterwords and nearly everything on the menu is affordable.  There are several vegetarian-friendly items although if I didn't eat fish/seafood at all I'm sure it wouldn't be my first choice. The only sad thing about this place for me is that I tend to avoid it during peak hours or if I'm looking for a more drawn-out, lingering dining experience."}
{"text":"New Gen is one of my favourite sushi places.  The food is good, the portions are big, the price is great.  My recommendations: Order the Ume Bento Box with Beef - it's HUUUGE and the sauce the put on the beef is really tasty.  For less than $10 you will be stuffed with deliciousness with free ice cream at the end to boot.  Spicy Vegetarian Maki - Again delicious! You can get this on it's own, or your can upgrade your bento box to include this for $1 - totally worth it.  Their spicy mayo is great, and the texture of softness and a little bit of crunchiness together is divine.  The Vegetarian Sushi pizza - whether your are veg or not this is really good sushi pizza and has a great presentation. Also great to share with friends. It comes covered in big avocado slices and topped in spicy mayo and a mountain of toppings. I've introduced it to bunch of people from Japan and they all loved it. (They don't have sushi pizza in Japan - it's a Western thing - so it's novel for them).  Usually the service is REALLY fast but I'm taking off one star because a few times I've had some bad service - once the waitress took my order but then just inexplicably walked away without taking my date's order.  Another time I was never brought one of the items I ordered (which was ok because I was STUFFED) when they brought me the bill the item they never brought was still on it, but they took it off without a fuss.  I think mostly these problems arise from the place being so freakin' busy and 95% of the time I've been there I've never had any problems.  But if do have problems I'd suggest you flag down a waitress right away because it can take them a long time to come around otherwise.  Every time I've done this they've fixed things, but I think they should be a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"It is a bit pricy than other all you can eat sushi places at lunch time but quality of sushi is good and also appetizers are tasty.  This place offer unagi and maguro ( never seen other places! ) I enjoyed takoyaki and yakitori very much. I would go back again when I feel like sushi next time :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my brother who came to visit me from Japan. The food was ok, but when we got home after having dinner there, I started to throw up and my brother had diarrhea a few hours later. I'm sorry to talk about this here but I don't think the fish here is very fresh. I'd never go back here again. Just no."}
{"text":"A solid late-night sushi fix. I ordered the salmon set and my dining companion ordered a selection of vegetarian rolls. The rolls are heavy on the rice and tempura bits, but the extremely reasonable prices, late hours, and variety of options make up for what's lacking in quality. One particularly good item was an appetizer of thinly sliced beef wrapped around enoki mushrooms - totally delicious!"}
{"text":"Open late, even during weekdays, so if you need your sushi fix, this is the place to go.  Very reasonable prices with large portions, you won't leave there hungry.  We ordered the Yasai and Ume Bento Boxes on this visit.  Both were served hot, fresh, and quickly.  This area of The Annex has several sushi restos within a stone's throw from each other.  Having a menu of delicious food and friendly staff providing great service is a winner in my book.    Definitely recommended.  Only criticism . . . carpeted dining room is a no-no.  By late night, it's covered in crumbs and bits of leftovers."}
{"text":"New Gen is one of the multitude sushi places between Spadina and Bathurst on Bloor. I've been to New Gen for a while, even when they changed owners/reopened. New Gen is definitely one of the better sushi places in this block, better than Big Sushi for example.   PROS The fish is fresh and the food is excellently priced. However, it is not as cheap as some of the other sushi places on bloor.  If you want a filling meal, I suggest their bento-boxes. I've always considered that to be one of the better deals, since you get some meat, rice, soup, as well as a little bit of sushi, salad and gyoza.  CONS New Gen is probably one of the more busy sushi places. I've had to wait for quite some time here and the one time I tried a reservation, I still had to wait.  They used to give freebies on the house such as edamame or seaweed salad. After the renovations, they've seemed to stop this tradition."}
{"text":"I went here a lot while I was working in the area.  It's always busy and the food is always fresh and delicious.  I miss it but sometimes my workmate and I go back for lunch.  $6 lunch specials with a wide variety of choices.  I tried so many and kept trying to order something different every time, but i could never remember what I ordered, so I may have over lapped."}
{"text":"Love this place! The manager and waitresses are very nice with great sense of humor. Always come here for the green & red dragon rolls."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service.  Nice setting.  I went at close to midnight, it was still busy and was so well lit that it didn't feel like night time at all.  It's great that they're open until 2am, I couldn't find any other sushi places online that were open past 11 or 12.  Interesting items on the menu!  The miso soup was good.  I can't remember the name of the rolls I ordered, but the caviar was nice and crunchy (kind of pop when you bite them)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was very busy. There was a large group of us so I had the chance to try quite a few of their maki. The most interesting out of everything I tried was the Cheese Unagi roll. The roll was wrapped with American cheese and while this may sound off-putting, it added something different and made it very flavourful. However, since American cheese is salty, I would not dip this in soy sauce. The other maki I tried was nothing special and nothing else stood out for me.  If I had to choose between New Generation Sushi and Sushi on Bloor (a few minutes away, but usually packed), I would choose Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"Came here twice for their lunch special....it's $6.99!  The service is about average, but their sushi is a hit and miss. The first time I came here, the sushi was good and the cheap price just made it better. The second time, not so good. The rice was hard, yet the sushi broke apart easily.  Not my first choice for dinning out, but will probably return once in a while if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu for $6.99! but I like this place even more when I came for dinner with 7 others last weekend.  The food were wonderful and the services were good. Will definitely be back for another dinner soon."}
{"text":"I was craving yam tempura and dynamite rolls. And that's exactly what I got.   Don't come here expecting the best sushi and Japanese food of your life, you're not going to get that at this price range. But if you're looking for a satisfactory meal at a good price, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is easily the best suhi place on bloor street (for rolls). People will try to convince you otherwise, but it's probably because they have never had the makimono set b (with spicy salmon upgrade! it's 18 pieces of sushi (rolls) - 6 spicy salmon, 6 spicy tuna and 6 california with miso soup and salad. I recommend pairing this with a budweiser). I swear they sprinkle crack on top, because after I go here it's all I can think about for days. Sadly, this place is always packed, and the tables are placed ridiculously close together. When I lived in the area I would usually come here at least once a week, and I would always have to wait for a table around dinner time (no matter what day of the week). For that reason, I would recommend this place for take out, or for lunch if you are looking for a quick meal, as it doesn't really have a 'relax and take your time' atmosphere. Also, if you are in to sashimi I would skip this place as there are much better places in toronto for that. Honestly.... This place burned down several years ago, and I felt lost and alone (sushi wise). Luckily, they rebuilt the restaurant (it is pretty much identical to the way it was before)."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has won out in my Annex 'War of the Sushis'.  With innumerable sushi restaurants on Bloor between Bathurst & Spadina, this is my bento box go-to.  They're open late (2 or 3am, I think), and the prices are very fair.  There's a discount for takeout, and the service - dine in or take out - is always friendly, efficient, and painless (unlike some other places *ahem* Sushi on Bloor).  There is quite often a lineup to get in, but there's lots of seating, so it usually doesn't take too long, and the servers are still great (not trying to rush you out).  I pass by it a lot, and I don't recall any Health code violations - also something that plagues a number of sushi restaurants in the 'hood. This is the sushi restaurant I recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great food.   Dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll, sushi pizza, dumplings, garlic shrimp & calamari. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Good place for sushi at reasonable price.  Tried maki combo two here and no complaint for the freshness and the taste.  The portion is slightly smaller than their neighbour SOB, but I can live with that.  One thing I'd prefer this over SOB is the service.  Both are efficient and quick, but I think New Generation is better at least during my visit.  The manager is friendly and is helping all over the place.  They also offer me complementary ice cream after the meal, which their neighbour neglected in doing.  As far as raw fish goes, quality is pretty much the same as SOB, maybe there will be difference in hot meal.  But since I'm only interested in raw fish when visiting Japanese restaurant, experience will mainly base upon that.  Overall experience is good, but don't expect anything too extraordinary or authentic.  After all it's a Chinese run spot and ideal for those who crave for sushi but don't want to break their bank for it."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI EVER, great service, try the brown rice yum! You can get a bento box which you can't even finish cause there's too much food but so delicious! My favourite sushi spot"}
{"text":"YES! Fast food service! Fresh sushi!   Three of us walked in and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for seats. There was a small wait line for this place. The dining room was packed!   Atmosphere: Simple modern interior. Dining room was a little bit crammed.   Service: The wait for a table took long (I thought), but we were served quick!   Food: The sushi was fresh and delicious! I also had a bento box, and let me say, I've never had my bento box so full. I couldn't finish it! For me, a man my size with a big appetite, that's a big deal!  WE ALSO GOT ICE CREAM ON THE HOUSE! SWEEEEEET!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. It is busy, but the people going and giving it high ratings must know nothing about good sushi or are drawn in my the cheap prices. Sorry, but you should not go cheap when eating raw fish.  Staff is unfriendly their only interest is getting people in and out. The food is terrible."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find some of the best sushi I've ever had in Ottawa, but I did - at New Generation Sushi!  The owner/sushi chef takes great pride in the fish he sources and the sushi he makes.  The tuna is special and not something that can be found in every sushi restaurant.  The eel is made correctly...the way you'd find it in Japan...served warm over the rice.  No imitation lobster in the lobster roll, but the real thing.    Not only is this some of the best sushi I've ever tasted, but the owners and staff are the kind of people I want to support.  They are kind and they are extremely hard-working.  The place is full at lunch but MORE PEOPLE NEED TO GO THIS DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT TO EAT DINNER!!  You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Incredible AYCE! Best in the city.  Have been twice recently. And both times the Shortribs stood out, so did the spicy salmon hand roll.  Everything we tried was delicious. The presentation is beautiful, staff are friendly and quick, and place is very clean.  Would go every day if I could."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. Friends of mine are regulars. Food was great, service was prompt and the food arrived hot. (big plus) The only downside is that on Friday / Saturday nights there is usually a long wait....oh well I think its worth it if you have the time!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and close to my school, but there are a few issues. They're nothing too big, just small things that I wish were different; like that we werent served pickled ginger, and how the tea was extra charge, but also, my friend's sweet potato tempura was undercooked, like, raw.   The service was decent, but the waitstaff are nice"}
{"text":"Loveee this place. I've eaten here so many times and the quality is consistent and the price is cheap."}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been coming to this place for 10 years and there's a reason they've been a neighborhood staple for a long time. They dish out decent, cheap, fast sushi to fill your craving without draining your wallet. The bento boxes are a particular favourite of my group. And every meal finishes with complimentary ice cream. What could be better?"}
{"text":"The highlight of New Generation is its pricing. The quality is surprisingly better than what you pay for, so it's definitely a steal, especially during lunch hours. The specials can average around $7 with a really satisfying portion. The service is respectable and friendly, and the atmosphere very welcoming. I've been multiple times and it's a place I'd recommend for good sushi at a really good price.   As a Japanese-Canadian, the quality meets my expectation for good value,  but if you're looking for an authentic japanese food experience, you may need to move on to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried New Generation about a week and a half ago. I got the Rainbow Maki and it was delicious. It is a pretty small restaurant and we had to wait for about 10 minutes but the service was fast and the food was good. I think I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, fast, crowded at times and once they offered to send us across the street to their sister restaurant plus 10% off.  Not authentic but satisfies my bento box cravings."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place and review it less than a 5 then you're the problem. This is the greatest place on earth."}
{"text":"Good food, great price. It's a student hangout and they've got cheap lunch specials until 5pm. Seems clean and service is fast."}
{"text":"Best Toronto sushi joint in terms of value. Affordable prices and portions are perfect. Ume box is a must and upgrade to one of the maki rolls for a $1.50 extra. Also, lunch specials are definitely worth the price. I've always came here for sushi, plus they're open late. Oh yeah, their fusion roll is a must try."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot but have since abandoned this joint for Big Sushi across the street.    Agreed--it's one of those \"Go to\" spots if you're in the mood for freebie green tea ice cream.  The prices are decent and the food can be tasty.    However, after so many orders that involved shrimp tempura, whether it came in a roll or it came as a starter, I noticed that this place does not de-vein their shrimp.  Now that's just gross.  Finding little black dots of excrement and sand on the surface of a Dynamite roll is revolting.  No amount of free ice cream can compensate my disappointment with this place.     It made me question whether other aspects of their food prep suffered a similar, but less-visible, fate.  *Gag*"}
{"text":"Although I would definitely come back to this place (Cheap as shit for lunch and filling) it fails to meet any sort of sushi expectation.  I came for lunch with my sister, she got some maki combo that included californian and unagi rolls (both were mainly rice), i got chicken katsu on udon (um, they messed up and brought chicken katsu on rice with a side of COLD bbq sauce), we also shared their special spicy tuna maki (the best of the sushi, but lots of rice and stuffed with tempura flakes and not really spicy).  That being said two salads, two miso soups, and all of the above came up to less than $20.   Why does it get two stars?  The service was sweet, decor was nice, the price was awesome."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is fantastic. It's a great place to eat at if you're on the go. The service and food preparation is quick and efficient. The fast service definitely doesn't take away from the food either, their sushi is always fresh and well prepared. Note - their lunch specials are great as they usually range from $6-9 for special sushi rolls or some bento boxes."}
{"text":"I used to love New Gen when I was a student and now that I'm back in Toronto I decided to give them a try again. Not sure if they've gone downhill in the intervening years, or I just didn't know any better back then, but one thing is sure: I'm definitely not repeating this experiment.  The quality and freshness of the sushi was so dubious that I left half of the gray, warm, fishy smelling pieces uneaten and I wouldn't be surprised if later tonight I'll end up regretting the ones that I did have. Yuck.  Yes, they're cheap but there are other sushi spots in Toronto where you can get a meal in the same range without having to settle for putrid quality.  P.S. I got delivery, which may account for (though not excuse) some of the issues."}
{"text":"Bloor and Bathurst is definitely my new go-to when it comes to good and CHEAP ala carte sushi. I always went to one place and always the same place everytime I end up around that area, and that was Sushi on Bloor. Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut, two nights ago, my girlfriends decided to eat here instead, and let me tell you.. Way better than Sushi on Bloor, complimentary stuff, salad, miso soup and ice cream for dessert, yes, meal came with ice cream. LOL the little kid inside of me was happy.   I ordered their spider roll and fusion maki, *AAAAAAAAAAAA drool*. I cannot wait to go back. I also ordered a sea weed salad and a can of diet coke, all for under $25. This place is definitely good, service isn't bad either, girlfriend serving me and my girls were so down to us and kept filling up my water without me asking, so to all of you extra bitches who are anal about service even though you're only paying chump change, here's a good one for you!"}
{"text":"Average sushi, it serves its purpose if you are in a rush and want some cheap sushi.  Everything is fresh enough but nothing here will blow your taste buds away.  Staff are really friendly and welcoming, and service is always quick.  Would go back if I'm in the area and hungry for sushi, but wouldn't really seek this place out."}
{"text":"Their food is always delicious. Have been coming here for the past 5 years and there wasn't one time where I had a bad experience. Also they open till 2 am which is a bonus! I love their spicy salmon rolls, dynamite rolls, tempura and sashimi. Their drink menu is very limited so you basically have the option of one kind is sake, domestic beer or house wine ( tastes very bizarre). You also get complimentary salad, miso soup and one scoop of ice cream whenever you order here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Here are some of my favorites: Mega salad, grilled tofu, vegetarian spinach rolls, and the yasai sushi combos. The prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food for your money. Staff here are really nice and the food comes quick too. I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for sushi in the Annex. Other decent places, but they've never quite done it right like this place does. Nothing too fancy here. Just straight up sushi.   Decent prices, solid hours, and not much of a bum rush. Been going for years now, will continue. Recommended."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and there seems to be decent amount of seating.  However, the food is very average and the salmon not so fresh when I was there.  The orange on the salmon sashimi was dull when it should be bright orange to indicate freshness.   I have also never seen a place so stingy on the wasabi! I had to ask twice for more wasabi because each time the plate of wasabi they gave was tiny."}
{"text":"Nouveau spot à Sushi sur bathurst et Bloor. Beaucoup moins bondé que son voisin le Sushi on Bloor. La présentation des plats est nickel et le service rapide. A recommander!  // New sushi joint on Bathurst and Bloor. Much less crowded than his neighbour Sushi on Bloor. Presentation of the dishes is neat and staff is quick. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The sushi was decent, but thats not what I came for. I went for the bulgogi, and it did NOT disappoint. Probably the best bulgogi I've had to date. The food looked really good, and my friends dish (Katsu Don) looked great as well. It was great that they gave us complementary mango icecream as well!"}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago with a couple friends and I was quite surprised.  We came right when they opened up at around 11:30am and we were greeted by someone who looked to be the owner or the person in charge. He was friendly and accommodating to my friend's food allergies. The other waitresses were also kind and attentive.  We ordered from the lunch deal menu so my friends ended up choosing a sushi (few pieces) + roll + handroll kind of combo and I ended up going with a beef shank bento box. Now from allllll my previous bento box experiences, they're generally small-ok sized meals. Rolls are usually same size as when you go for AYCE sushi and they'll give you a few pieces of tempura or you'll have some noodles. BUT, and I kid you not as I will post a picture, this place was DIFFERENT. I'd like to say they gave me salmon makies that were DOUBLE its usual size with a BIG piece of salmon in the middle!! Now we all have experienced that time when they give you a ton of rice and BARELY a good-sized piece of fish to go with the amount of rice they wanna stuff you with. Here, there is nothing to worry about! On top of that I got at least 6 pieces of veggie tempura! I don't recall ever having that many in bento boxes before! But I do admit I rarely go for the ones that have tempura...regardless, I'm not sure if all this was because we were their first customers but if this is on the regular, that's awesome!  By the end of the meal I was definitely full. Not uncomfortably but just a bit over what I expected. My friends were feeling the same way and one thing to note along with the BIG makies I got was that my friends also got a BIG slice of fish to cover each of their sushi. It was like a blanket over the rice! Same with the handrolls! I literally went O_O when I saw. The fish tasted great and fresh too! So what more can we ask for? We definitely got our money's worth for $8.99.  We also asked for tea...specifically we said green tea and we had to pay $1 for that. I wasn't sure why as I assumed tea always came with the meals...however, it didn't bother me much as everything else was perfect. I guess maybe because we said \"green tea\" and not just \"tea\" and they also gave us separate tea bags.  Anyway, I will definitely be back to try other orders from here to check on their consistency. If you want to get à la carte sushi for lunch and don't want to be disappointed, come try it here :)"}
{"text":"The service was okay, but the food was terrible. The rice in the sushi and the rolls was so mushy. There was so much grease in the beef teriyaki. All that I can taste from the beef teriyaki was the oil in it. The chicken teriyaki basically had no taste. This was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place.  We went here a lot during the weekdays in the summertime.  We always get the buffet deal.  Its worth it!"}
{"text":"One of my longtime favorites in the Annex. Noteworthy for vegetarians, they have an extensive selection of interesting veggie sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Quick and good service! Hey also have lunch special la that are half priced in the weekend. Amazing deal for quality food!"}
{"text":"I love New Generation Sushi, it's so affordable that I never have to choose between a rainbow roll, california rolls, and teriyaki chicken. I just order them all and they all taste awesome!  The only sushi restaurant I like more is New Generation Grill Fusion which is across the street, which has the same food and prices (plus a Korean grill menu), but a much shorter lineup."}
{"text":"?????????????dundas?ayce??????????ayce??????????????????????????ayce?????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ayce??????????????????????ayce????????????ayce??????????????????????ayce???????????????????????????ayce?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????pad thai???????????????????????????????????????pad thai???????????????? ?????????????ayce?????????????????"}
{"text":"For that price, the sushi is amazing!  They are also the only one that opens so late.  Every other places is closed by the time they are still booming.  I used to go there all the time when I was in undergrad, they've consistently satisfied me.  Don't go expecting to be fine dining, but go expecting great value for some pretty good sushi.  Quick service even if there's a lineup.  There's a pretty good reason why there's a lineup as well."}
{"text":"Love the booths.  Prices are good but watch out at lunch specials, sometimes they actually aren't a better deal than just ordering off the main menu.    Service is okay, not bad for a sushi restaurant but hardly attentive.  Women's washrooms are a major fail - not a hook in either stall? Just go and buy a sticky-back hook from Dollarama and slap it on there...so annoying.  Sushi rice was inconsistent - sometimes good, and sometimes hard and unappetizing.  Tea was not even lukewarm, just room temperature.  So why three stars?  Nostalgia, familiarity.  Only recommend if you grew up in Toronto.  Newbies need not apply."}
{"text":"We got some take out sushi here. Unfortunately we felt like the rolls had way too much rice on them and weren't packed very well. With all the sushi options in the area we likely won't give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I came to New Generation Sushi a while ago with a group of girlfriends. The interior of the place was pretty nice. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. I am a sucker for tempura and it was divine at NG sushi. We had a really great time there hanging out and the waitress was very kind and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Great lunch special and quick service. My take-out orders have been mis-entered in the past, which is a pain.  They make great maki rolls.  Great value for the money. It is always packed, so get there early."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi in town. But certainly not the worst.  Service is always efficient and I've never had anything here I didn't like. Sushi Pizza With Tuna, Mega Salad and Crispy Vegetarian Roll are perennial favourites.  My criticism lies with how busy it is and how cramped it can get if you don't get a booth. If I'm dining with friends on a budget, I'll suggest New Generation so we can all share a bunch of stuff, eat enough for everyone to be hungry and not hurt the pocketbook too much."}
{"text":"Have been going here for at least 10 years and have seen many renovations but the sushi consistency remains great.  Almost always ordered the Take Bento box - choice of beef, chicken, salmon, comes with shrimp tempura, sashimi, sushi, dumplings, rice.  Everyone gets miso soup and salad regardless of what you order.  Salmon donburi - very generous portion.   You get ice cream after your meal"}
{"text":"Got delivery here and it was so-so. We ordered Party Tray E, which came with around 30 or 40 pieces of sashimi and maki. The rolls were pretty standard but I was disappointed with the lack of variety: they gave us California with roe, salmon, salmon with tempura flakes (which were not very crispy), kappa, and kappa avocado. The sashimi was weirdly lukewarm and tasted fishy, the seaweed was damp and the sushi poorly/haphazardly wrapped. It definitely did not seem like it was made to order. The avocado in the kappa avocado roll was a mushy smear inside the rice. Maybe the dine-in experience is better, but I was personally unimpressed with the quality of the sushi and will not order from here again. Delivery man was nice, though :)"}
{"text":"Updated and upgraded! +1  Running through the 6ix in search of inexpensive, quality sushi will no doubt lead to manifold woes. And then...~New Generation~. I was impressed by my AYCE dinner experience at the newer venue but still felt it was just a bit pricey. Lo and behold, I discovered New Gen's lunch special (offered at both Bloor St. locations)! You have before you an eclectic variety of Japanese fare to indulge in for the unbeatable price of $6.99 (nearby Big Sushi is competitive at $6.95, but I felt New Gen's selection was simply superior).  I am, admittedly, a harsh critic, but my dining experience left me with nothing but absolute satisfaction. I had the roll option (2 maki orders, 8 pieces each) which was a steal (where else can you get 16 pieces for under just over $8 after-tax?!). The rolls (yam maki and spicy vegetarian maki - but you can opt for a number of different fish rolls at the same price) were mouthwatering; light and fragrant. The servers were pleasant and their service was fast (full disclosure: the restaurant was only half-full upon arrival). I would add that I appreciate how the restaurant pays attention to little details; the flower-shaped wasabi on my plate and display of the Chef's special on a chalkboard were lovely touches. And as someone who is not typically a fan of miso soup, I found New Gen's take on miso to be refreshing! Overall, hands down one of my best lunchtime experiences."}
{"text":"This place is nothing better than okay. The pricing is good but the sushi is meh. I'll have to try out more Sushi places in the area before I can offer an alternate option."}
{"text":"I don't understand the popularity of this place.  The value is definitely there, but the quality really isn't that great.  The rolls and sushi had way too much rice and were rolled almost haphazardly.  Nothing tasted or felt particularly fresh (might explain a bit of bellyache afterwards?)  The miso soup was uninspired.  The black sesame ice cream was incredibly delicious, incredibly overpriced ($5.50) and served already half melted.    Why, oh why, with so many other reasonably priced sushi options out there, is this place so busy?"}
{"text":"We had sushi there yesterday . We thought about the buffet but my kids don't eat that much . The sushi was good very fresh . Prices are a little high. We ordered the sushi pizza.which looked interesting.  Good service and pleasant surrounding."}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill. My friends and I used to frequent New Gen years ago. So, when I was in the area with a friend, we decided to drop in for lunch. We both ordered from their lunch special menus (meals range from 8.99 to 10.99). We both ordered the chicken katsu bento box and shared a maki roll. The waitress asked if we wanted pickled ginger on the side--and I thought it was weird there wasn't any on the table in the first place--but never came back with it after we said yes.   Anyway, I found the food to be really bland and flavourless. Without sauce to dip in, the chicken would literally taste like nothing. The rice on the sushi was on the dryer side, and it was also bland. Near the end of the meal, my stomach was starting to feel weird and I didn't want to finish the rest of the meal. I felt nauseous about half an hour after we left. Once my friend was home later in the evening, she was sick as well (I'll spare you the details). We suspect it was the chicken that was the problem.  Back in the day, New Gen used to give you free ice cream after your meal; not anymore. It seems like they really skimp and try to save $$ where they can...I mean, not providing pickled ginger unless requested and charging for green tea when it used to be complimentary? I'm definitely not coming back again especially after our experience. A cheap meal is not worth getting sick right after!"}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, good prices. And I like the Gojiro artwork on the wall. Note: there are two New Generation Sushis within three blocks of each other. If you are meeting someone, make sure you specify which one."}
{"text":"I usually go to Sushi On Bloor (opposite this restaurant) but they were overly packed and I was starving. I chose this restaurant instead of the other sushi restaurants around Bloor and Bathurst because of its modern design and atmosphere. Food was good. Price was average. Service was good. Quality of food was good. Clean restaurant. Friendly staff. Service wasn't extremely fast but it wasn't extremely long either. A bit more expensive than Sushi on Bloor but the price is worth the portions you receive. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Pretty much like any other sushi place in the annex.  the interior is nicer than sushi on bloor, but same level as big sushi. What I dislike to the nth degree is the tempura flakes they put on EVERYTHING..but i've come to know that as a general quality of sushi in toronto that is a really distasteful practise.    Helll, if I could find a cheap sushi place that didnt' use tempura flakes as filller all the time, that itself would deserve an extra star."}
{"text":"I don't remember ever not liking a place that serves sushi. I mean, even bad sushi is good sushi right?  I ordered a makimono set that came with california roll, spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. $13.95. It came with a miso soup and a salad.  Verdict - it was bad sushi. The rice was too soggy to the point that there was a weird vinegar taste. The ratio to rice and fish was weak and a little stingy and it just didn't taste good.   The california roll was decent because there wasn't much    Rice. The spicy salmon wasn't spicy and didn't have a lot of the spicy mayo that I enjoy. The tuna tasted very tough and plastic-ie.  A plus is - the service was decent and it seems like the people in the area like this place.   Would I go back? Prob not. There are better places for sushi in In the area."}
{"text":"The maki rolls were good. They had good flavouring. They definitely make the portions sizes on the bigger side.  We ordered the Tuna Dragon, BBQ Maki, Futomaki, and Sashimi Diamond. I enjoyed all the maki sushi. My favourite was the BBQ Maki that has eel, salmon, and cucumber. However, I was very disappointed in the sashimi. It was ok. The portions were not cut nicely, and the fish was served in huge chunks. The knife work was lacking. Even I have prepared better shrimp than the tiny ones we were served.  I didn't enjoy the salad the dressing, which was bland and mayo based. The miso soup was okay.    The service was good. The food came promptly, and our server was quick to take our order. I liked that there was someone constantly refilling our tea. Another plus was the free ice cream that they serve you at the end."}
{"text":"This is my daughters favourite place, and given the competition all around, manages to stand out.  The spicy vegetarian Macki is particularly pleasant . Bento boxes are ample .  All the staff are friendly and efficient and the service is swift .  This is fairly reasonably priced - for example dinner for four was 80 bucks all included .  They don't take reservations , but if you're a regular they will hold the table for you ."}
{"text":"I don't understand the fascination with this place. I have been here on 3 occasions. I have been twice with a friend who consistently raves about this place.  I have tried various rolls, sashimi, and even tried a green curry chicken dish.  There is some value since pricing is reasonable, but the quality is nothing to write home about.  I would rather hit one of the all you can eats since I did not find the sushi here to be anything better the what you would find at an all you can eat."}
{"text":"For getting on the wrong cable car and street, I needed something to fill my stomach so instead of to a sushi place that is about to close soon, I went to one that will close at 2 am. First thing I had was the basic sushi, tried the seaweed dumplings and for closing out the night, had an mango ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"One of my better choices when going out for cheap sushi. Quality and craft is a little better than places like Sushi On Bloor. Although dare I say it? I have more than once felt that SOB gives you a little more fish and a little less rice in their Maki... Mmm... Still their special combinations and their bento boxes look better than SOB's.  Anyway, I enjoy their seaweed salad and their Ikayaki which are priced cheaply in the $4.00+ range. All of their sushi prices are pretty standard fare however their flavour and quality is solid. Service is touch and go at times as the place usually gets packed around the dinner stretch and it affects the speed and quality of service, not to mention most of the server's English is far from par.    I do like that most of their meals include ice cream and I have to admit I have never felt rushed after my meal, which a few Asian/Sushi places tend to do when they are busy by just tossing you the bill.     PS:. Some of my acquaintances, specially the superstitious ones do not go there because of the grisly murder back 2009."}
{"text":"I have always gone ot Sushi on Bloor over New Generation and there was never any real reason for this just the way the cards fell. I stopped by New Generation this weekend late at night (around 1:45 a.m.) and was pleasantly surprised they were still open, and busy. I wanted to grab a couple of things for take out. I ordered two rolls and some sashimi.  OMG, the sashimi pieces were HUGE. The biggest I have ever seen in any sushi restaurant. I don't know if it was just a fluke or if the pieces are always that big. I got the typical salmon and tuna pieces so maybe it's because they are most common.  The couple of rolls that I got were not so great but they were not bad. I have had better rolls at other places. I always try to order the unique rolls that a sushi restaurant offers and I wasn't overly impressed with the ones I got. The one with the asperagus was particularly strange.  I have been to this place one other time with a large group and remember the service being really quick and good. I am definitely a fan and would return to New Gen whenever I get a chance.  All and all, I was very happy with my midnight snack choice and I will definitely be back to New Generation.  mmmmmmm, sashimi!"}
{"text":"Solid late night sushi in the Annex.  Definitely better than Sushi on Bloor, don't believe the lines there.  Great combos, specials.  This is not a spectacular place, just solid, consistant sushi that's fairly fresh, for student prices."}
{"text":"The best AYCE in downtown! Strongly recommend mango fushion, akagai and unagi sushi!"}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu mostly for the low prices! Lunch special work salad and soup is only $6-7!  I wouldn't say they are differentiating themselves from other sushi places around them (and both of their locations on bloor are surrounded with sushi places) and I can't vouch for the freshness of their fish as a vegetarian but the veggie options are good and there is also always a bit of line ups during lunch and dinners but what I like is that staff isn't trying to get rid of you when they see a line forming."}
{"text":"New Generation offers great sushi - maybe not the absolute best I've ever had, but still top-notch stuff. Getting a table at dinnertime is impossible, but my friend and I sat at the bar (got a 10% discount!) without a problem. The food comes out super fast, and the service is great, if rushed. Coming from NYC I appreciated the no-nonsense attitude, but I can see some people getting flustered by it. The prices (for Bloor) are really reasonable, and the portions are large. Most combos come with soup and salad, as well as ice cream at the end. The beer prices are good, too. The menu is a bit large and daunting, but I plan to go back, just to try out new things!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place! Reasonably priced and consistent. Always great service."}
{"text":"First time coming here. The staff were nice. The food was good. It's really small in here, definitely not good for parties. They were generous with their sashimi slices thank god. I ordered California roll, salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi and bbq short ribs and I am 100% satisfied"}
{"text":"An old stand-by, obvs. As far as \"cheap\" sushi goes (meaning about on par price-wise with any other non-fancy sushi joint downtown - about $35 all-in for dinner for two), the quality at New Gen is better than many, plus it's nice and clean. I have no complaints. Super polite, efficient, pleasant to be around at mealtime, music playing softly - basically, the opposite of the actual new generation. *shakes cane*  I'm sure previous reviews have covered everything you need to know, so I'll give you something new: the doubt-inspiring Cheese Unagi Roll (with eel, avocado, cucumber, tempura bits, and some sort of fluorescent yellow Kraft-esque fromage, $7.95) is GREAT. Try it if you're adventurous. If you're not, a) let's not hang out, and b) everything else is fresh and tasty too. Lucky you!"}
{"text":"Best cheap sushi in toronto!!!  I've had multiple thing off of their menu including seaweed salad, all the tempuras, gyoza, bento boxes, rolls, sashimi, etc. Always happy with the quality and tastiness of the food. AND the staff are always super friendly!!!!   My favourite menu item: fushion maki!!!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to spot. I just came back after a few months' hiatus and I see that they have renovated the space (murals, renovated bathrooms so they are unisex)  New Generation now charges money for tea, the salads are smaller, the rice for the sushi was gummy, and the cucumbers were limp and irregularly cut. Fish portions are smaller too and the seaweed for the sushi is a light green rather than the usual dark green (???)  The quality has taken a dive and I dont know if thats due to a new sushi chef or if there are new owners but I dont think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place a try, from the reviews mostly. My whole party (of 3) were physically sick shortly after the visit.  I found out they not passed the check shortly after.   Anyway, won't be going back. There is only so much food poisoning one can take. Well in this case just once at this place will do it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and this was the first time in a while.   Excellent mid priced Japanese food from sashimi to teriyaki to short ribs and a whole slew of rolls.   I got the short ribs dinner tonight $16.95. Comes with veggies and soup and salad and ice cream.  The ribs were heavily marinated hut with lots of fat.   I was impressed for a few things. If I put an empty bowl or chopsticks wrapper on the table ....*WHOOOSH** off goes a server with it almost immediately.  Also he came tabus with separate bills and a portable machine without asking  They've been operating for a long time and they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This place is a gamble. Had it in the past and its been ok. Had it again and it wasnt so good. Ordered a salmon avocado maki roll with yam tempura. Salmon had the consistency of mushy paste that i could stick my chopstick right through. Yam was undercooked and a bit hard. The yam I can deal with, the mushy salmon i cannot. Had to throw out my meal and ended up feeling sick later after eating 3 of the rolls."}
{"text":"They have $8 lunch combos so I'd definitely recommend if you're on the street and want a cheap but quality eat. There's two on the same street and a bunch of other sushi places so nothing is ever too busy."}
{"text":"This location often gets confused with the other \"New Generation Sushi\" on Bloor Street however, I usually do take out orders here. They have really good options for lunch specials and they're very friendly. Their take-out takes about 15 minutes depending on what you order and how much but overall, I really enjoy how fresh their sushi is. My favourite there is their Salmon Set!"}
{"text":"Was there today, and while the atmosphere was nice and the servers friendly and welcoming the food was way below decent. There's lots of good reviews for this place, so perhaps we were there on an off day. That being said, we'll be voting with our feet and won't be back for a second chance. With so many sushi places within a stone's throw I see little reason to go there again.   Our meal: the rice was overcooked (to the point where it sticks to the roof of your mouth) and the fish was not chilled properly. My salmon rolls were warm to the touch, which is never pleasing when it comes to raw fish. My girlfriend's sushi was equally disappointing: warm fish, overcooked rice. She said to me as we were leaving \"I'm still craving sushi.\" Me too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  The fact that this place always has a line up (of at least 3 tables) speaks about popularity by itself.   The place is small, cozy, and if you don't know it, could be difficult to spot because the entrance is narrow.   One thing I don't understand about the management is why they make reservations if they always lack spots. Waiting 15 min. for a table (while 3 or 4 empty ones have the reserved sign) when you are hungry is like a culinary harakiri. Don't join the conga line if you are starving, you will give dirty looks to the people eating hoping to scare them away.  Once seated the service was really fast. I think that the quality of the seafood over passed the beef's one. The salmon sashimi was really fresh, buttery, and colorful; I recommend it 100%.   I also liked the spider, spicy tuna, and dragon rolls.  The beef tataki was dry and chewy, so do the short ribs, as well as the beef slices on the pad thai. On the other hand, I tried a bit of the chicken teriyaki and it was juicy, tender, and crispy.  The unagi, ebi, and salmon teriyaki were perfect.  I liked that they kept asking us if we wanted more items, and whatever we asked in spare of the main order came right away, they didn't \"forget\" like in other AYCE joints..."}
{"text":"My favourite place for AYCE and for eating a la carte. It might be my favourite because it's close and convenient for me to get to but the service and food has always consistently been good. I've never had a bad experience here and the rolls and sashimi are great! It's also great for take-out. The prices are reasonable especially for the quality. I'll admit, sometimes when I go, I have trouble choosing which rolls I want since I've tried them all so many times because the menu isn't that big but they're good so I'm not too upset about their limited variety!! Clean restaurant and I've never experienced it really busy!"}
{"text":"This downtown sushi joint has been here for quite a long time. i had it before many years ago. and since i was around thr neighbourhood recently decided to try it again. i hate to say it but it has definitely gone downhill. i had ordered a teriyaki chicken  and tempura bento box. and there were quite a few mistakes. the teriyaki chicken was mostly tasting liked boiled chicken with a mild waterdown teriyaki sauce which you cant taste much. and the same problem for tempura qhere they gave you a Tempura dipping sauce that had clearly veen watered down into oblivion l. they might as well have given you water. cause there wasnt kuch difference in the sauce. tempura depens largely on the texture of thr batter. and the flavour of the sauce and natural ingredients. this was just not there. overall the food was just below average and not worth going to for anyone. i wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area cause the pricewas not great and neither was the food quality"}
{"text":"Decent, good quality sushi - I had the spicy tuna set which was tasty and fresh. Great lunchtime prices. I want to try a bento box next time. I've heard a lot of comparisons between this place and Sushi on Bloor and although SOB do great salmon teriyaki I can't seem to ignore the persistent stench of bleach in the restaurant. Really gross. For this reason I think I will be coming to New Generation more often.  Ok, so I did try the beef bento - delicious, generous, steaming hot - but I really don't get the deal with the 'salad' at this place. It's basically lettuce with runny mayonnaise. That weird 'salad' is the lowlight of this whole experience. I recommend either changing it  or going without it altogether. Just don't do that and call it a salad."}
{"text":"Ive been to this sushi restaurant at least a handful of times.  it is fast spaced and a relaxed social atmosphere.  no matter how busy it is the food has been very reliable.  this place seems to be a well oiled machine and the sushi is good.  decor isnt all that appelaling but if you just want really good sushi to go or to sit in with your friends this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Sorry, Torontonians, don't mean to be a hater but you're really lacking on the sushi front.  I mean, tuna should be reddish, not gray.  What gives?  But if I had to pick the best sushi place in the area, it would have to be New Gen.  Maybe because it satiated me during long nights in the studio, or because they tend to throw in freebies (ice cream, anyone?), but probably because it was the most edible - take that, Sushi on Bloor.  The Miso Soup is just fine, and the California Rolls are rather tasty.  The Tuna Rolls leave something to be desired compared to what you can get in the States, but were the best that I had in Toronto.  And they have some really random food here too.... Shitaki Butteryaki?  One of my classmates ordered that over the phone and I just cracked up.  This is a popular place and gets packed - especially during lunch time.  The place is clean and ambiance just fine, if a little cramped.  But they also deliver - including to UofT buildings.  If you're getting delivery, you can get a party sushi platter mix and share it with friends.    Prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. I went for lunch. Couldn't decide on which special (for $6.99) I wanted. Eventually pointed randomly and got the chicken bento. I got a tamago hand roll to go with it ($2.95). The hand roll came first. I was impressed right away. Lots of egg. Sushi rice was the best I've had to date in Toronto, and the nori wasn't tough. Yay!  The salad seemed to just be lettuce and mayo. The miso soup was awesome. The tempura was crisp and stayed crisp until the very end (I saved a piece for last to be sure). The chicken in the bento was good. Slightly heavy  on the onions, but whatever, I ate around them. It included salmon maki instead of the typical california roll and it was good. Big roll, fresh fish.  The service was quick and efficient. Water was always full. They checked in to make sure it was all ok. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I`ve been to most of the restaurants around here.  Haven`t been here for a long time.  Came here during lunch on Sat and its still pretty much the same quality.  Kind of meh but not bad either.  One thing that kind of got me irritated was the fact that one of the waitresses came over with a dish for another table and wasn`t being careful about handling the plate.  Sauce was spilt on the chair opposite me (I sat down at a table for two to work on some stuff) and also on the table.  Almost ruined the documents that I was reading.  She didn`t say anything and just cleaned up the mess with a tissue.  Kind of paused to wonder if she had time to do it.  Lunch could have been better with better service."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to say about New Generation Sushi; it executes well but plays very safe. It has a great, lively feel and is almost always full, the sushi is good and reasonably priced, and the servers don't judge you when you wear soy sauce to show your date what eyeblack looks like.  Probably the best sushi in the area at the lower price range."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I regularly come here to eat and the food is pretty good for what you pay for. We usually order the salmon sashimi don which comes with complimentary salad and miso soup. For every regular meal you will also get ice cream on the house.  Food is good for the price and service is generally fast and accurate (not to say they don't mess up every once in awhile but that's normal with any restaurant).  The seating is kind of awkward if you do not get a booth and the place is VERY busy at night.  Highly recommended sushi place if your budget for dinner is about 10-15 dollars/person."}
{"text":"i only order one thing here, seafood udon!  one of the best japanese places i think. free soup and salad with watever you order. and free icecream too in the end!  i have not found anywhere that makes udon this way! waaaay delicious. it's served with a metal pot, i feel so authentic. the rolls aren't bad either. only once i got spider roll and the softshell crabs felt like they were fried a long time ago and went soggy."}
{"text":"Pros: - Fair prices.  - Menus are easy to follow.  - Nice interior with intimate ambiance - perfect for group settings and dates. - Attentive staff - I was pleasantly surprised since they were quite professional and (unlike lots of AYCE sushi restaurants) actually ask how the food is which gives them brownie points in my books. - On the house ice cream!   Cons: - Tuna roll in Matsu combo 2 did not taste fresh at all - it had a very fishy taste to it.  - A couple of items in Matsu combo 2 looked as though it was just thrown together at the last minute. The salmon handroll was literally a cone of seaweed with rice and some salmon stuffed in it - that was it! No sesame seeds in the salmon handroll...nothing to make it stand out a bit more. Perhaps opt for more elaborate handrolls? Or have tempura instead of handrolls? Although the salads and miso soups that sometimes come sushi combos aren't usually expected to look that great, to me, having all food items well presented is important as it demonstrates how much the restaurant cares for their customers. The salad was literally some leaves and carrots thrown together with dressing (although dressing was good). It could have looked better if there were more ingredients and it all the ingredients were arranged more nicely."}
{"text":"New generation (Blood north location) is home to my favourite AYCE sushi location in Toronto. For dinner, they carry all the traditional AYCE items as well as additional fusion items that are delicious. Item quality is also significantly better than the traditional cheaper AYCE joints.   My favourite items are the fusion roll (torched salmon roll with avocado, imitation crab and cucumber), the pacific roll (salmon ikura with smoked salmon, cucumber), the mango salad (the mango they use is actually ripe), the gyoza (these are filled with meat and very yummy) and I can just keep going on and on.   Price of AYCE is slightly more expensive than the conventional ones but still cheaper than AYCE giants such as spring sushi or kaka."}
{"text":"This place is still as popular as ever. People love the value sushi on bloor and for my money, it's a dog fight between here and Sushi on bloor. Both places have quick service, fast turn-over and complimentary fixins (miso soup, salad and red bean or green tea ice cream).  If you're a sashimi lover than sushi on bloor gets the nod, if you're a roll lover than new gen might eke it out. Either way, you're getting reasonable quality stuff at a good price.   Go early or be prepared to wait and then chow down"}
{"text":"Decently priced sushi! I always go for the bento box meals. Staff is incredibly nice but the sashimi portion of the bento boxes is small and food is a hit and miss. Last time I got the bento with Korean barbecue ribs and they were so hard that I couldn't eat them.   Another thing is that I've been here 3-5 times and EVERY SINGLE TIME, a homeless man comes in and gives cards asking for money. I only ever carry credit or debit, I never carry loose change and EVERY SINGLE TIME I apologize and this homeless man makes angry and rude gestures to me or anyone who does not give him money.   I truly think that the staff here should not allow him to come in. If he was doing no harm, sure let him, but he's constantly harassing and making very odd and rude gestures at people who came to eat and it makes it a very unpleasant experience.   The homeless man who constantly harasses people when they don't give him money is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. I believe that the staff should stop allowing him to come in several times a day because it truly ruins the dining experience and makes customers feel very uncomfortable.   I once offered the man some of my sushi since I had no cash and he waved his hand angrily and dismissed me. I also come for lunch and late nights and EVERYTIME HES HERE. I dread when he comes in because I know he'll make me feel super uncomfortable for not carrying cash and I'm not going to go out of my way to go to an ATM to grab cash for a man who dismissed the food I offered him and the times where I sincerely apologized for not carrying cash."}
{"text":"Love this place...the food is great and it's super cheap! $25 all you can eat! You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. My gf and I were very hungry at the time we  went so we just ordered a whole bunch of stuff   * bacon wrapped scallops * bbq eel sushi  * salmon special (handroll, sushi, & spicy salmon) * mixed tempura  * Matsu combo 1   Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs on this night. But didn't realize the rolls were be so big. Which is a good thing. We actually wanted to go to sushi on blood but was too packed so we went here. Wasn't a bad substitute. The environment was bustling, & vibrant. Lots of energy from the servers   The one negative is that they charged us for green tea.   Overall, not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"I've eaten in and taken out a couple times each now, and it's a relatively standard cheap sushi joint.  You get what you pay for.  Their lunches specials that go till 3 in the afternoon are around $6-7 and there is a fairly wide variety of options from sushi rolls to udon to bento boxes.  Although the quality isn't amazing, it is acceptable and the fish is generally fresh. The udon/bento boxes are too salty and their tempura batter is actually decently done.  Unlike some other sushi joints, their terriyaki chicken isn't just drenched in the sauce, the meat does is flavoured and textured well.  Service is fairly good, the servers are attentive and refill your tea/water without asking.  All in all, not a bad place to visit to fulfill a little sushi craving."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to sushi place for years. Hands down, the best lunch special in town in terms of value/quality - until recently.   The owners recently renovated and reopened. Upon visiting New Gen after the renovation, I was incredibly disappointed by two things:    1) They now charge for tea. Tea used to be complimentary, but now it's not.  2) They have seriously started skimping on the salad. You used to get a little bowl of salad with your lunch combo, but now you get about half that amount. It's iceberg lettuce - seriously, how cheap can you get??  I really hope they reconsider these changes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice because it's close to Lee's Palace and the other options nearby aren't very appetizing.   It's not that this place is particularly bad, it's just that it's nothing special and I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it. There is no way that this is the 'best sushi in Toronto'. I suppose if you're hammered out of you mind anything tastes amazing. It's cheap considering it's somewhat central location but this is Toronto and there are a bazillion Japanese restaurants many of which are better.  One good thing is that unlike some other Asian restaurants, they don't seem to give you a big fuss when splitting the bill. Other restaurants just look at you with that a blank stare but New Gen actually suggests it."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is open late, has delicious sushi and gives you free ice cream. New generation rocks! All they need is a late night sushi ayce menu and I would live there."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best \"low-cost\" sushi I've had in Toronto. Always fresh, especially the melt-in-your-mouth salmon. Great combos and deals, and the lunch special is truly amazing value. The crunch roll and rainbow dragon rolls are particularly awesome, as is the sushi pizza. If you order at least one set, they will bring you complimentary miso soup, salad, and usually ice cream. Service is friendly and the vibe is casual yet fun. Very downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Good quality, very reasonable price, but small space. These guys make a great job delivering well prepared, fresh sushi. The staff is always helpful and ready to serve you. Try not to go during peak hours. As I said before, prices are more than ok. Order the bento box if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"New Generation sushi has been my go-to place for the last three years, but moreso since late 2012 when they added to their lunch menu. One option on the menu stands out the most to me: 8 + 8 pieces of maki, of which you get to pick the kind. The selection is wide ranging from standard California rolls to spicy shrimp tempura.   I am consistently impressed with their servers who always greet me with a smile and are just lovely people. In my opinion, this place (including the New Generation just down the street) is the best quality value for your money in Toronto. Oh and if you go during peak hours when there's a line up, the New Generation down the street on the north side of Bloor is rarely as busy as the one on the south side."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot in Toronto! They have lots of vegetarian options - including the mango fusion sushi and the new gen fusion sushi (has a spring roll in it!)   I came here on a Saturday for dinner and service was fast and we got free ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"The katsudon is so tasty which is my always order! The pork chop is so crispy and the quantity is large that I am velvet able to finish. Some yelpers under me mentioned the food quality went down and the food price had been raised, however, I think the food quality has been the same all the time. And nowadays everything becomes more expensive, it's understandable that they charge a little more. Anyways, their service and food satisfies me as usual."}
{"text":"New generation used to be a bit better when i tried it about two years ago, but the last time I went it got significantly worse.  The food did not taste good at all.  Not sure if they changed chefs but the chicken that I had the most recent time I went was chewy and flavorless.  The rice was bland and somewhat overcooked.  The only redeeming factor of this place are the low prices (no surprise there) and the sometimes good service (one time I went with a group and they gave us all free ice cream for dessert)."}
{"text":"This is a great all you can eat spot! Reasonably priced for good quality sushi.  Note: they didn't charge us extra when we left 6 pieces of sushi behind."}
{"text":"My mom told me that if I can't say anything nice, I shouldn't say anything at all.  But then this would be an empty review.   The quality of the fish was on the lower end of mediocre, and the service was just atrocious.    * The restaurant is a bit stale inside; no atmosphere or ambiance at all.    * My friend brought in a Diet Coke left over from our poutine across the street and the waitress sharply asked \"did you get that here?\" \"Well, then you need to get rid of it now.\"  * I ordered the Sashimi Crystal combination sampler with Tuna, Salmon, Tai, Hokkigai, Tako, and Kanikama.  I asked what the kanikama was (crab stick) and she said \"crab.\"  I always thought it was imitation crab, so I confirmed, and she said \"well, okay, it's fake crab.\"  And then I asked, okay well what is it made of then?  And she didn't know.  She guessed \"flour.\"    * The staff seemed to rush us quite a bit.  She kept asking what I wanted to order, and then they were quick to take away my food before I finished the last bite.  When we left we saw why - a line had formed.  * Our waitress spoke such poor English that I had to resort to Mandarin to communicate.  And yes, that also means some of them were Chinese (and Korean), not Japanese.  * The green tea and mango ice cream dessert was clearly from a neighboring grocery store and had freezer burn."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.  It's not that I need to be INSPIRED by sushi.  I mean, one can't ask for a miracle every time he takes a knee.  Sushi is, by its very nature, a refreshing and purifying experience, from the first comforting slurp of miso soup to the last palate-cleansing piece of pickled ginger.  And it's not like a sushi establishment can fall THAT low, what with the potentially-fatal food poisoning and all.  So am I OFFENDED by New Generation's utter lack of care, from the slapped-down food by the eye-contact-avoiding waitresses to the lowest-common-denominator rolls?  Do I clutch my PEARLS at their half-hearted, unevenly chunked avocado-and-iceberg-lettuce avocado salad?  Am I WEEPING over the sad strip of tuna, bulbous rice, and lazy dump of crunchy in my spicy tuna handroll?    No, friends.  I'm just underwhelmed is all.  When I first moved to Toronto, a young naive lass, I came here because its claim to fame was that it was open after 1am.  The fact that I can't remember the last time I was awake past 11:45pm leads me to believe I've outgrown it.  Fortunately, there are about 12 other sushi restaurants in its two block radius in which to spread my wings and fly."}
{"text":"Went during the lunch special and had a pretty satisfying meal that included sushi (yam, mango, tuna and salmon) plus the salad and miso soup. All for about 18 $ for two."}
{"text":"got takeout the other night- salmon teriyaki. two large pieces of salmon- delicious meal! thanks again!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Always quick, delicious and about the price you expect to pay for sushi. Some other spots in the area have inflated prices for the same quality meal. Try the Gyoza. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I'm certainly not the first to review this place (actually it looks like I came a little late to the party) so I'll try and keep my review brief. The venue is small so it can become packed during its busy peaks but the inside is done up nicely. I like that they have the sushi bar right open to the front of the restaurant as it is nice to see the fresh fish being sliced and crafted into rolls. The menu is quite large and includes a tapa style selection as well as a combo and meal portion. At ~$10-15 per meal I found the pricing to be on point. The vegetarian and alternative options were abundant. The service was very friendly, quick, and generally attentive. Between the three of us we ordered a rainbow maki roll, 1 fusion roll, 1 Take bento, a Handroll set and of course 4oz hot sake to warm the bones. They brought 3 soups and salads despite us only ordering 2 meals, and offered ice cream on the house to finish the meal. The total bill came to ~$50 with tax. The standout was probably the Fusion roll which was flametorched to smoky perfection, and consisted of a California base topped with charred salmon, and smothered in a sweet and mild combo of sauces."}
{"text":"New generation has been increasingly disappointing. The fish was low grade and the beef was inedible. I also ordered the soba noodles for take out and didn't get the quail egg or green onion that is supposed to come with it. The soba noodles tasted bland compared to what I've had before... I think I'm going to pass on new Gen from now on, unless my friends insist on going and if that's the case I'm only getting veggie Sushi. For those looking for a place in the Annex I believe the few extra $ to go to  Sushi Couture is worth it."}
{"text":"If you want cheap sushi, this is the place. But you get what you pay for as the rice to fish ratio in sushi is more rice. Will be back if I'm in the area ... and on a budget"}
{"text":"Amazing good for really cheap. Definitely coming back regularly. For around 13 bucks 6 rolls of sushi, a bento box, and free ice cream. Place is clean and has a nice ambience to it. Staff is friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"Had 4 interesting vegetarian maki rolls (the mango fusion and new generation vegetarian maki were great), together with sake, plum wine and tea for $40. Great value, good food, pleasant atmosphere. Recommended"}
{"text":"Great AYCE restaurant. The service, food and decor is wonderful and the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I swear by this place. Fantastic sushi and awesome value, too! The selection is incredible and better than most other sushi spots in the city. The staff aren't the friendliest but that doesn't really matter. The place gets packed, though so if you come on a weekend be prepared to wait! Overall, easily Toronto's best sushi."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is great. I go a little crazy on the salmon sashimi and beef short ribs. Several orders of each. The get a little smaller as you keep ordering. Crunch roll is my favorite. Friendly and fast service with some decent free mango ice cream at the end. I definitely get my money's worth and more."}
{"text":"Only have good things to say about this place. I've been to many AYCE places but this one is my favourite so far. We went on Saturday around 6pm, it wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Everyone there was really friendly and service was very quick. Many servers came around to take away our plates, refill our cups and our orders without having to flag them down.  The food was really really great, everything tasted fresh and looked good. Menu is very good in terms of variety. This place has AYCE sushi and Teppanyaki but I just went for the sushi this time.  Will definitely go again and try then teppanyaki next time. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time, I love this place. The food is good and the ume box is best for price, quantity and quality!  The service is pretty good; friendly and nice.  Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very fresh and affordable. I seem to always get the combo :)"}
{"text":"Had to go for dinner before a concert at Lee's Palace. Came here on Yelp's recommendation and it was great! Delicious food and amazing value, I couldn't finish. Roughly $10 for my meal with free ice cream too. Fastest service ever, waiters are constantly checking tables to see who needs plates removed, the bill, etc. which is nice but also made it feel a tad rushed. Definitely come here for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Where's the fish?! Felt so ripped off, paid $25 for RICE. Go at your own peril, this place ain't nearly what it use to be."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite haunts to host a sushi and bent box lunch on the cheap.   The food is hearty and clean, plus the staff is friendly and very efficient.   This is the key place in the annex where I take my friends out for a good and healthy lunch, not to mention good sushi."}
{"text":"\"Sir, would you like some free ice cream on the house?\"  Would I?   Absolutely.     Maybe it was because they sat us right near the door?   Maybe it was because someone kept inadvertently whacking me in the head with a tray whenever they walked by?  Maybe it's because we were talking a-little-bit-too loudly about the brutal murder scene that happened in this sushi joint a few months back?     Whatever the case, the ice cream was really good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time because another sushi place near by had a lineup.  Although New Gen was also really busy for lunch, my boyfriend and I were able to be seated immediately.  However, we were seated only 3 inches away from the table next to us, so we decided to shift away a bit more but ended up on slightly uneven ground. Thus, my boyfriend had to keep his foot on the table leg during the whole meal so we would not wobble!  The lunch prices were good, but the variety of rolls weren't, so I ordered the lunch special chicken katsu udon noodle soup. My boyfriend ordered the Take Bento Box with beef teriyaki and we also got a Red Dragon Maki on the side to share.   The miso soup was extremely salty and the salad was okay.  The bento box was decent, and the salmon and cucumber maki rolls that came with it were big portions.  The Red Dragon Maki was passable, but looked a bit sloppy and it didn't come with wasabi nor ginger on the side.  Unfortunately, my udon noodles were NOT tasty. The noodles didn't seem like fresh udon.  The noodles were flat, very similar to linguine or other Asian noodles.  Definitely not the thick round udon noodles that I'm used to. The broth was watered down and tasty funny, and the katsu was soggy by the time I got my dish because they put the chicken into the broth instead of leaving it on the side.  I was quite disappointed at this place because I thought I had heard some good things about it in the past. There are definitely more worthwhile sushi/Japanese restaurants in the neighbourhood. I probably will not return to New Generation."}
{"text":"Out of all the sushi restaurants I have been in the GTA, New Gen has the best quality sushi at a decent price."}
{"text":"The lunch is good and inexpensive .  The freshness and quality of food is good but not the best .  Overall a good sushi restaurant on bloor st. ."}
{"text":"New Generation Sushi   Without a doubt one of the best sushi in Toronto. They have 2 locations in the same area. There's an a la cart on the north side of Bloor and the AYCE (all you can eat) is on the south side.    Location: If you don't know, they changed Bloor St a few years ago. There was on street parking on both side of the street. They have removed most of those spots to make space for bike lanes. But there is a Green P parking lot near by. It's also not far from a subway station. 4/5 stars   Atmosphere: Like most restaurants on Bloor, both location is small. Each location seats maybe 75 people at one time. They do play some music but isn't too loud. The AYCE location tends to be slightly louder due to larger groups and the decor is kinda dark. The wall with the wood highlight needs to be dusted. I do enjoy the other location, as it has more of a whimsical feel, with the great murals. 4/5 stars   Service: The service is different between both locations. The AYCE has a great turn around once guests leave. The servers are always busy taking orders, they do not do the tablet ordering, but they are easily called upon. The other location, I find has a bit better service. They are always looking around to see if any of their guests needs anything. 4/5 stars   Food: Both places have the same menu. Good quality fish is used here, unlike other sushi places. It doesn't smell fishy, you can tell they use fresh products. Try their specialty rolls! They have your typical rolls, sashimi and cooked Japanese dishes. If you don't know what to have, why no try a little bit of everything with their bento boxes. 5/5 stars   Price: Considering they have 2 locations, the price for AYCE is cheaper/comparable to other all you can eat sushi bars. The a la carte location is reasonably price. Rolls prices range from $5 and up. Free soup and salad with your meal. 5/5 stars   Overall: What more can you ask? This 2 locations are very reasonable, great priced and clean places to eat. It maybe your next go to sushi place in Toronto 4/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"12 am and me and my boyfriend were craving sushi. We were walking along Bloor and noticed this place closed at 2am on a Saturday!! We both got the tempura maki and it was so good. Fresh and flavourful. Defiantly coming back here within the late hours to satisfy my sushi craving"}
{"text":"This review has been long over-due.  I love this place and I can't deny it; even after bloody murder.  The service is great, the food is excellent and the price is right.  Loving their new mango roll, which has yams in it.  Although not the best mango roll I've ever had, it was very refreshing.  Also love how they give you free miso soup and salad and complimentary ice cream when you order a good size meal.  Other things that I also like: their udon soups, spicy salmon roll, spider roll, and man... can't think of one thing I don't like, so everything!"}
{"text":"Love their lunch menu. Only $8.99. Got the chicken katsu bento box. It came with possibly a bbq sauce that wasn't too great. But everything else was good. Also served with soup and salad. Been here a few times before and they're staff are always friendly and service is always fast."}
{"text":"We came here because it was open late at night. It was open when we wanted to eat and it was cheap. The food was ok, though not great. We had one sushi combo and one bento box. The sushi was passable, though not spectacular and the bento box was solid, though the pork teriyaki was over cooked to the point of being bone dry. We got a ton of food for a little over $20 and definitely couldn't finish it all. If I lived near here it would definitely be in my late night rotation, though there is a lot of competition around so it wouldn't surprise me at all if there is better Japanese food to be had around here."}
{"text":"This place is just okay, in my opinion: Pros: - The prices are good, especially for lunch specials ($6.99); - Great location; - Plenty of seating; - Sushi is good enough, but nothing \"wow\"; - The employees were nice and friendly. Cons: - No parking (park on street, if you are lucky to find a spot); - Lunch combo portions are pretty small. I ordered two sushi that came with salad and soup - the salad was way too small - just few bites actually, and the sushi were also small; - I wasn't impressed with my sushi, they could be better. Probably won't come again, will try other places around."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty bad. The Miso soup is way too salty. You get what you pay for, and I will pass on this."}
{"text":"I gave new gen 4 stars in my previous review. I had been a regular for 3 years. I finally came back after a year and boy did they change. For starters, they raised the prices on many items on the menu. They also charge a dollar for green tea. The quality of the food has gone way way way down. They fill rolls with rice and barely any protein. Refer to my picture. I paid $7.50 for an unagi roll with barely any unagi in it. So so disappointing (new) new gen.. you used to be reliable. Safe to say I won't be coming back... it's been good"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant can easily be overlooked. The restaurant is small, and it looks really dated. However, I learned very quickly not to judge a book by its cover.  I have been here several times. The bento box for lunch is $6. The dinner portion is $11. I am very satisfied with my meals there. A good sign of a good Japanese restaurant is their tempura shrimp. The batter is light, crunchy, and not greasy. The rolls are decent size, and the fish is fresh.  I love the Fusion roll. It is my favourite roll at this restaurant. When my friends say that they want sushi, I tell them to come here. This particular location is a la carte. The location across the street is AYCE. However, I have taken left overs several times, so I don't do the AYCE, but I am sure that it is excellent."}
{"text":"I wasn't overall impressed when initially entering this place.   it sent off vibes that my stomach might need to be on guard for what it might experience here but I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The service was great, got free salad, soup and ice cream with my meal and the sushi was top notch. Even great the day after. If you are in the Bloor/Bathurst area check it out. Love the feel, definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"Well this is my first yelp review and tbh i never cared for giving reviews since im a server myself and know usually the reviews are full of sh*t . But anyhow came here late after work on a Saturday night the place seems nice and the salmon was fairly fresh . The service was actually quit nice too compared to other sushi places ."}
{"text":"So disappointed!!! Decided to go for lunch last week and sadly hated it. I use to love eating here (have been a patron on and off for the past 10 years) but even nostalgic memories couldn't save my taste buds on this visit. Tuna was tough and the rice tasted like it had been sitting uncovered for the majority of the day (extremely hard). I should also add the tempura bits were stale. With so many sushi restaurants on the strip I would have thought they would care about quality, sadly mistaken. Painful to say but I will never be back. I guess this is my way of breaking up with a restaurant I use to love"}
{"text":"Got food poising from ordering the 'Ruby Sashimi' within 40 minutes of leaving the restaurant. Highly suggest staying away from it. Usually my 'go-to' place- but with new staff (not friendly) and poor service + Food Intoxication- I won't be going back for a while. There's plenty of other sushi restaurants on bloor."}
{"text":"I was there on MonJan 11 '16 for dinner solo.  Solo diners seem to get seated by the door where it's really cold! I kept my winter jacket on the whole meal.  My order was the Sashimi Ruby (3 pieces of salmon, red snapper, tuna, and butter fish) with a side of sushi rice, soup and salad for $12.95+ tax.  Everything was good except the tuna. Also they didn't give enough pickled ginger or wasabi on the side so I had to ask for more. In addition, my sushi rice came about 5-10 mins after my sashimi came out, after they asked me if I wanted it, and after I asked a 2nd server where it was. I wonder if they ran out? It was odd but once I got it - it was perfect.   They were attentive in regards to filling up the tea (although I had asked for water and never got that).   I enjoyed the free ice cream at the end. And I ate it even though my hands were frozen. I noticed quite a few people getting take out.   Tax & tip it all came to about $17 for 12 pieces of sashimi + sushi rice, and soup & salad."}
{"text":"The go to spot for sushi along the sushi dense stretch of Bloor between Spadina and Bathurst. The tradeoff between quality, quantity, and price is generally better here than other nearby sushi restaurants. Service is quick and friendly.  The menu is large and has all the standards. You'll get complimentary salad and miso soup to start and ice cream to finish. Plenty of vegetarian options here as well so I never feel left out when when I go with fish eating friends.  An all around reliable spot for affordable sushi in the Annex."}
{"text":"VIBE  You're here for the sushi, first and foremost. It feels very \"New York\" in the sense that it's crowded, noisy, light and bright and the servers aren't really paying attention to you. It's not my preferred atmosphere but it works.   I ATE  I always get the dynamite rolls here. They have tempura bits in them and they are delish! Yum and Yum. Miso soup hits the spot as well; gyoza are a bit greasy but I like greasy.   Dining companion got the sashimi and man, it was a lot of fish! Super fresh and tasty if you're looking to up your intake of oemga 3s.  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Old Generations and New Generations will call this a safe bet for affordable sushi. An Annex stand by."}
{"text":"I pretty much only come here for one dish, so I can only comment on that lol.  I have to say that I love Salmon. Salmon salmon salmon. I love it, and usually that's the only sushi/sashimi that I want. So what do I come here to get? The Salmon set of course!  Spicy salmon maki, salmon sushi, spicy salmon handroll.  Watch out for peak hours as the line will start all the way out the door."}
{"text":"It was my first time back here in years since university and I was pleasantly surprised.  As far as inexpensive sushi goes, this place is one of the best in terms of value and decent, good food. The Ume Bento Box completely filled me up:  teriyaki chicken, rice, abundant tempura, 3 gyoza's, soup, salad and ice cream.  The service was also quick and courteous.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've been away for several months and chose to make New Gen my homecoming celebration dinner spot with a few friends tonight. We arrived at 7:30pm and were not too fussed about waiting in the more or less expected line up of about 6 people ahead of us. The flow seemed to be going smoothly until we got stuck hopefully at the front of the line. After a while, the host (which turned out to double as a server), came out hurriedly looking for a party of six which had shown up later than us, but were no longer anywhere in sight. When she was finally satisfied that they had left, she sighed loudly and said that we could have the table instead. It turned out not even to be that big of a table and fit us quite comfortably.  The sushi was delicious as always. There's a reason I've been a fan of 3+ years, ever since I lived in the neighbourhood once upon a time. Tonight, one of the chefs walking by even stopped to ask how everything was tasting - a much appreciated first here!   However, when it came time for the bill and my friend inquired about the ice-cream that almost always comes with the meal, our server gave us a lecture about how you don't get any when you share a bento box.  So, let me get this straight: If one person orders even the cheapest  bento box , she gets an ice cream. If two people share a huge bento box (an all out sashimi, nigiri, and roll splurge which filled us both to the brim and cost us each more per person than our third friend paid for her meal solo), we get no ice cream at all? It wasn't even like we were asking for two...  Cheap and tasty sushi pretty much always. Ice cream and decent service usually. Unseasoned and awkward servers occasionally."}
{"text":"FOOD:   PRO: I love their Fusion Roll, Takoyaki, salmon belly and all their ice cream flavors (red bean, green tea, and mango). Their food here overall tastes so good. CON: Spicy thai soup tastes so weird for me, but when you have it on All You Can Eat (AYCE), that's not a deal breaker at all coz you can just order other food on the menu.  PRICE:   PRO: Price is $18 for AYCE. A bit pricey I think but you get the value of your money.  SERVICE:  CON: The service here is not good, they don't give you all your orders, not sure if they do it on purpose, coz it happened many times already.  AMBIANCE: PRO: Ambiance is good. It is casual to sophisticated vibe, meaning you can dress up casually or formally, it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"New Gen has always failed to impress me. When I moved into the Annex 4 years ago, I went here frequently - until I discovered Sushi on Bloor.  Both places (New Gen, Sushi on Bloor) are definitely the two most popular sushi joints on the street. I'm slightly baffled why New Gen gets so much business over some of the other mediocre options on the street.   The sushi is adequate and cheap. You don't get the huge portions that you get at Sushi on Bloor, so if you like big portions, stick with Sushi on Bloor.  I had a few awful meals at New Gen (really greasy chicken terriyaki for one) but generally it is decent. The service is A-ok and decor is nice-ish too."}
{"text":"I thought New Generation is one of the \"best\" sushi places I've had since coming to Toronto. I ordered the beef bento box (cost approximately 22 dollars). When the bento box arrived, it came with chicken and beef...I guess I didn't catch the chicken part in reading the description..  I like the california with salmon sashimi roll. I thought it was very tasty and the sashimi was quite fresh.   The disappointing part was that one of my friends found a fly in his donburi and told the waitress. They told him they weren't able to re-do the meal. Kind of disappointing since what anyone would expect them to re-make the meal.   They gave us ice cream in the end of the meal. Something i don't normally see in other sushi restaurants.   I would come back again to try other rolls."}
{"text":"Opinions and assholes, you know the saying.  Of course, when it comes to an opinion on sushi, people generally find ways to be an asshole.  Let's be honest - while 20 years ago, sushi was still considered an exotic treat, it has now expanded in such a way that many neighbourhoods in North America housing younger generations with disposable income to spend on food contain more of these raw-fishaterias than McDonald's.   Sushi is every bit as mainstream as national coffee brands or discount shopping centres.    As such, all of us under the age of 40 have cultivated personal tastes based on initial experiences, background, travels and diversity with sushi.  With such an abundant (and diverse) choice of sushi restaurants, how are we to decide which new one we will try when entering unfamiliar territory?  A walk through the Annex, this problem was solved for me immediately.  In a college town full of what is sure to be the snobby and, based on saturation, well regarded taste in sushi, I have found one truth to hold - that New Generation is always the busiest of several similar restaurants around.    Despite some negative reviews, I have yet to come here when it wasn't packed, be it on the weekend or after work on a Wednesday.  The restaurant lends itself to this, of course, considering the small shotgun setup packed with tables and booths, surrounding the smallest sushi bar feasible relative to the legal occupancy.    Most people with a group larger than 2 have had to wait for a table, a problem that I, more than willing to sit at the sushi bar, have not had to endure.  Despite the large crowd, service has been as prompt as reasonably expected, and more importantly, the sushi comes out quick.  Standard with a sushi meal is salad and miso, neither being particularly remarkable.  I judge any sushi restaurant based of a plate of chirashi, or selected sashimi on top of a bed of steamed sushi rice.  New Generation's prooved good quality - the fish was fresh and served at the appropriate temperature (I hate when sushi is too cold), and the rice warm and slightly sweet.    The rolls are numerous and general Toronto fare, I can't say I've had one that stood out or was sub par, but they do seem to lean toward the unadventurour and tempura based variety.    At the end of the meal, I was offered complimentary iced cream, which I was far too full to try.  All in all, I'd say this sushi restaurant can be considered a trusty choice for anyone in the area.  I haven't had any of the non sushi dishes (which are plentiful), though I'll fix this in the future and report back.  If you're looking for something new that you haven't seen in the last 20 years, New Generation isn't for you.  But if you want the equivalent of sushi comfort food like you had the first time, expect good quality and service from the Annex staple."}
{"text":"Remember the good old days when rock and hip hop were still alive and when the sushi joints used to provide salad, miso and ice cream with whatever you ordered?! New Gen is still in with the old in that sense, and this, along with the fact that they serve up a comprehensive menu of Japanese goodness past 1am makes them a reasonable option amongst the plethora of Annex sushi stops!   As for the food itself, I found my negimiyaki subpar at best with way too many green onions stuffed in between the thin grilled beef! The few maki rolls I ordered were also not the greatest I've had recently and lacked any particular kick. That being said the fish was reasonably fresh and I recall having decent sashimi at NewGen back in the day!  Overall worth checkin out during the wee hours! 2*food + 1* for extras!"}
{"text":"On a lovely Monday evening we were planning to hit up Sushi on Bloor (btw - they moved down the street) unfortunately they were completely full, as usual.  Having to resolve or sushi fix, we walked into \"New Generation Sushi\" from the outside we were hoping it's authentic (Japanese owned), but as we sat down, I can hear a few waiter speaking Cantonese (I think loll)  The price wasn't like other weekday AYCE rate it was $21.95. I felt a little pricy, but meh, we went for it! I'm a sucka for Spider maki and they have it :) besides, there have a decent number of selections.  Highlight of the visit: to my surprised their good is very fresh! And definitely try their soup noodles in the menu! It's amazing good for an Ayce  Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 3/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Fun Factor: 1/5 pretty standard. Not much hype :("}
{"text":"As a Vancouverite, I've have a hard time finding good, fresh, and delicious sushi in Toronto that doesn't literally cost an arm and a leg.   After meaning to try this place out since moving here, I finally had lunch there today.   Walking in, it was clean, well furnished, and we were welcomed immediately and taken to a table without hesitation. Our server was friendly, brought water quickly, and gave us time to look at the rather large set of 3 menus (lunch special, all you can eat, a la carte).   After much deliberation, my partner and I ordered the following:   (1) Gyoza (1) Agadeshi tofu (1) order of #111: (1) salmon roll; (1) spicy tuna roll; (1) california roll; and (1) order mango fusion roll *  I'm allergic to avocado, which, as a vegaquarian (no meat, just fish), can make sushi difficult. I really wanted to try the mango fusion roll which, as is pretty standard, had avocado. I asked our server if I could change it for cucumber (hence the *) and she did so without additional cost or any fuss.   My partner said the gyoza was \"quality\", as was the salmon roll, spicy runa, and california. The mango fusion roll, with the substitution of cucumber, though, was hands down my favourite. Large pieces of mango atop a yam tempura and cuke roll. Delicious. All of the pieces were large and the rolls were 8 pieces each.   The only think I didn't really love (and wouldn't order again) was the agadeshi tofu. While the pieces were a good size, I found the broth far too \"fishy\" and the batter on the tofu thin. I'm sure it's favoured by some, it's just not my favourite preparation.   For $31 total (just water to drink), this was one of the best casual sushi experiences I've had in Toronto.   Will certainly be back"}
{"text":"They have very cheap lunch specials, bento boxes and party trays, a lot of which inclue a small miso soup and salad. They feature so many different combos and bento boxes that you'll probably find a permutation offering everything you want.   The service is super fast and more friendly than your typical cheap sushi restaurant.  I found the rolls to be below average in quality. They are at the same level as low-end AYCEs. Lots of rice and skimpy portions of fish and veggies. The rolling is also sloppy and uninspired.   With all that said, you can't beat filling up on sushi for less than $20. Ice cream's on the house!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi joint in the Annex and I affectionally call it:  \"Murder New Gen.\" Why? Because I am an insensitive bastard, who likes to make light of a very serious fatality that occurred here a few years back.... and because not 10 feet away on the other side of the street is another place called New Generation!  I hate trying new sushi places because I constantly feel like I have to modify them combos and bento boxes to suit my unsavoury obsession with Salmon. This is not the case here as they offer a Salmon trio in the form of 108A: Spicy salmon hand roll, spicy salmon maki rolls, and 6 salmon nigiri pieces. It's what I get every time and it's always good.  As previously mentioned, the soup, salad and ice cream are free and they are open super late."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious sushi. I am torn between New Gen and Sushi on Bloor, because they are both so good and so cheap...  New Gen has a nicer interior, and free soup, salad and ice cream with every meal. I am a sucker for green tea ice cream, so that is one point for New Gen.  Sushi on Bloor is a bit cheaper, which I liked, but New Gen's rolls are generally tastier. Also New Gen has a lot of vegetarian options that my vegetarian friends swear by.  Expect lineups around dinner, but they have a pretty fast turnover rate so you shouldn't be waiting long. They're also open really late which comes in handy if you get sushi cravings at midnight. Which I totally do."}
{"text":"Really bad sushi here.. wow. I remember coming here a year ago and the sushi was fine, so I'm not sure what happened. The salmon sashimi tasted a little odd, like it had been sitting outside for awhile. The spicy salmon roll was so bad, I had to force myself to eat it, so I didn't waste the money completely. It tasted worse than supermarket sushi. I'm so surprised that the food was this bad. Never again. I will give it two stars instead of one, because the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"There are actually three different New Generation Sushi locations; two of them are located within walking distance of one another on Bloor St W. The following review is based on the original location (the non-AYCE). A friend suggested this place for dinner, and I agreed to check it out with them. All of the tables were taken that Saturday, but the turnover rate was pretty high. The two of us got a table within 15 minutes of arriving. We were seated and given the menu which was rather large, and many of the items are fairly priced.  Unfortunately, I had a small lunch that day as I was busy all morning running errands. So I was super hungry by the time dinner hits. I opted for the NewGen Grill Bento ($22.95). The meal consisted of short ribs & chicken, dumpling, seafood tempura crunch roll (3 pcs), salmon sashimi (2 pcs), salmon sushi (2 pcs), and steam rice.  The sashimi and sushi selection in this bento box was standard which was salmon. The sashimi were thinly sliced, and the quality was decent. However, there was nothing particularly memorable about the sushi or sashimi. On the other hand, both of the ribs and chicken teriyaki were tasty, and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Satisfying quality for the price. My friend and I ordered a sushi roll that had torched salmon with mayo sauce for $8.95 which turned out to be great. Lunch specials are all 7.95 including bentos for which you have three or four choices.  Con: no free tea"}
{"text":"I had to stop myself from giving New Gen five stars, because I know it's nothing close to perfect, yet I feel this strange affinity towards it. I'm so attached that no other sushi place satisfies me. It's weird, I know. Anyways, onto my review...  There are a ton of sushi places along Bloor, yet New Gen is always packed with a line up out the door if it's around a mealtime. That's one drawback but they usually manage to get people in and out of there pretty quickly so you won't be waiting long.   The menu is fairly large and inexpensive. I can usually never decide what to get so I end up getting a bento box for a little bit of everything. Most menu items come with free soup and salad (the dressing is to die for, I've asked them if I could buy some once and they kind of just looked at me like I was crazy) and at dinnertime they serve ice cream on the house.   The service is super fast and efficient and I like that they don't make a big deal out of splitting bills or running debit/credit instead of cash. It's especially convenient if you're with a group of friends. I find the food delicious and very fresh, and there is also a delivery and take out option."}
{"text":"I have visited New Gen many many times. Its a great place for sushi, bento box and japanese appetizers.  The food is truely amazing. I love the Fusion Maki, Salmon Roses, Take Box, Urajiro (appetzier) among many other things.  The price is reasonable for the quality of food.  I would definitely recommend their food to anyone who likes sushi.    There are two issues with this place however: 1. The place can get really loud which is not great if you are looking for a quiet dinner with friends or family.  2. They are really popular which means they have a lot of customers which results in the staff kind of rushing you sometimes (in terms getting the bill and stuff)"}
{"text":"They renovated!  this has been the go to place for a complete meal approximately 12 dollars.  Guaranteed to make you full  and to top it off you always get ice cream.  Cant beat it.  cheapest bento boxes in town.  I'll be back.. but interesting fact about this restaurant.. someone died in this restaurant a few years back.. a staff got hacked with a knife is what i heard."}
{"text":"Amazing sashimi!!! Love the service too. Constantly filling up water, asking us the quality of the sushi, taking away plates. Great selection of sushi and easy to get to from Bathurst station.   Will definitely come back for all you can eat. :)"}
{"text":"Good place for sushi, I was reccommended to come here by my boyfriend and so I did.  It was pretty good sushi.  I was here for lunch and the lunch special was a great deal, 5.99 for a sushi combo or some udon etc.  We got the grilled chicken udon, california and unagi roll combo and a rainbow roll and 2 pieces of saba sushi.  It was very tasty and the fish was fresh.   I would reccommend this place!  And I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super awesome maki. Very yummy. The unagi was especially good and the specialty rolls were all great. Excellent post Pearl Jam late night eats. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"This is it. This is the best restaurant in Toronto. No matter what I am doing, I will always give a huge, resounding, wholeheartedly genuine \"YES\" to anyone who asks me if I am up for New Gen.  It's delicious. It's quick. It's affordable. It has something for the vegetarian who doesn't eat fish (wassup spicy vegetarian maki roll and tempura yam and avocado roll) (that would be you, 99A and 99E), it has something for the meatiest meat eater. It has everything in between.  It has sushi pizza. Order the sushi pizza.  In addition to the maki or whatever you've ordered, you generally get miso soup, salad, tea (but you have to ask for it), and ice cream (sometimes). This is amazing! and is actually more delicious than other sushi places' offerings.  They deliver (until 11). They deliver sushi and the joy of eating their sushi.  They give you discounts: 10% for eating at the sushi bar or going to their other location if the one you are at is flooded with people, 15% if you do takeout.  The only bad thing I have to say is that it is not so environmentally friendly if you do takeout. Everything comes in styrofoam in a giant plastic bag that you can't really reuse and it hurts me to think that even though I walk there to pick it up, it is still damaging to the environment.  But on a happy note, New Gen is actually the best sushi that I have ever had in the world (even better than that Toronto roll in Berlin), I take everyone there, and I have actually eaten there twice in one day on many, many occasions.  99A and 99E. Eat it."}
{"text":"Came here for buffet dinner, super hungry. Ordered some sushi rolls, and my bf and I couldn't finish about 4 sushi pieces because the concept of sushi in this place is 99%  rice and 1% you hope for some non rice ingredient. It was pretty bad.  At the end the waitress tells us she'll have to charge us for those 4 pieces bc her boss doesn't allow leftovers. So we said we can't finish it bc of so much rice in it. The boss comes over and argues with us that this is what we're gonna get in every restaurant and that we are being rude, waving his gracious hand and telling us he will allow us to leave the 4 pieces unpaid for. Obviously the boss skimps on ingredients, holds tight reigns over his staff and obviously doesn't understand the concept of customer service.  What a horrible experience..."}
{"text":"I'm actually giving New Generation Sushi a 3.5/5 (but Yelp doesn't enable users to do that). Surprisingly, this is one of my go-to and almost favorite Japanese restaurant. Their food is quite decent (and I mean that honestly) - it's not cheap food court nor it's not too high end. The staff are always so friendly and professional. Although the ambiance and interior is fair, while also showing signs of age. Please don't get confused between this restaurant and the second New Generation Sushi (now New Generation Fusion Grill) located across the street - Thank goodness they changed the name... finally. It was quite confusing and redundant. But I digress.   Overall, if you're looking for a decent, reasonably priced Japanese food and good service, New Generation is on my almost favorite list.   *Disclaimer I came here on a Friday night after 8.30pm dinner so your experience may vary"}
{"text":"Great for those late night sushi cravings!  10% off for take out?  Done!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and it gives a lot of food. My cousin and I shared Newgen Grill Bento and Soft Shell Crab. We only had 1 piece of Soft Shell Crab for each of us because we shared with our friends but the Newgen Grill Bento box was so much food that we couldn't finish. It was pretty good, it was pretty sad they only had green tea and red bean ice cream."}
