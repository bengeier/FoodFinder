{"text":"Nighout with the girls ended up here after scraping the idea to hit Niagara Falls as we had a cruel week of nonstop essays and tests and we were in no condition to drive that far.   We ordered nacho, pizza and wings. The wings were ordered with BBQ, honey garlic, mustard and cajun. We concluded these foods were notch above the likes of St. Louis and Crazy Wings. Nacho had diet-destroying layers of cheese and salsa sauce was delicious. Pizza was alright but we still enjoyed it as it had more than enough amount of toppings. The wings were a hit. They were really delicious and sauces were incredible.   We enjoyed its casual and modern ambiance but our server was too overly enthusiastic to the point we were wondering whether he was on something. My only complaints are the foods that came out too slowly and small tables that couldn't fit all our plates."}
{"text":"Okay ... where to start... decor ... it was alright, not very clean. There were flies and wasps flying around inside.  The plates were metal, quite old and scratched. The food was okay - wings were tasty but very small and quite expensive.  The onion rings were good.  But our experience was cut short- at 5pm their band started - we were the only guests inside the restaurant aside from the band's family. The music was fine but so loud - we had to leave. It was as if the band was performing only for their family members.  It was a bit too much for 5pm on a Sunday when most people go out with their kids.  So we all left - hungry. Unable to speak to each other or the server as the band took no breaks. Completely inappropriate.  Would not go back... many other places in this city to spend our money."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a chance having watched them put some impressive efforts into their design before opening up. But I've eaten here three times hoping the next time would be a better experience only to be disappointed each time. Now I've come to the conclusion that it's only good for beer and fries out on the patio. The food has been a major let down. I've never tried the wings mind you, but did try the hamburger, poutine and fish tacos respectively on each occasion. The basic hamburger is nothing fantastic. We ate inside and I couldn't stand the noise factor. The place had a couple kids parties which isn't my ideal ambiance. The second time was the same irritation with the ambiance. I had the poutine and they were skimpy on the gravy, it wasn't great gravy and the cheese curds never melted.  The third time we were out on the patio and I had the fish tacos and that was the third strike, food-wise. They over-salted the fish and the presentation was bland and disappointing. I've had way better fish tacos at fast-food restaurants. Having said all this, their french fries have been consistently good.   Overall I don't enjoy this place as a neighbourhood dinner spot. And now that the Firkin across the street has re-opened after drastic renovations, comparing the empty tables at DnF to the full tables at the Firkin, it seems the locals prefer the Firkin instead as their trusty neighbourhood beer & grub hangout. I would say DnF needs to rethink their demographics, and their chef."}
{"text":"Best wings in Toronto? Without a doubt. Everything about it from the food to the service is top notch. Wouldn't recommend any other place!"}
{"text":"This place is located at a convenient location for me, as I am from the area. It's opened fairly recently (few years) and enjoyed it a few times until a few weeks ago.  Their wings are OK, not as good as some people make them out to be. They also need more beers on tap, as their selection is pretty poor.  Worst thing about it, which happened a few weeks ago, is the service. I went in one night, and the bartender was just talking with a friend (I'm assuming) , and ignored me without trying to serve me. I asked him to come over and serve me, and he seemed annoyed by the fact that I asked him, and was very rude about it, to the point where I had to leave.  Not going to this place again, bad experience. Safari Bar and Grill, which is owned by the same people, is much more friendly, I would go there instead."}
{"text":"Visited Drums N Flats for the first time this week with some colleagues for dinner and drinks after work. Overall, food was mediocre at best and the same could be said for service. Granted -- wings places aren't notorious for having the best of either of those.  Relatively inexpensive beers make this place a good spot for an after work beverage on what is easily the largest patio in the area.  Not the best wings I've had, but not the worst."}
{"text":"If you are going to call yourself \"Drums & Flats\" then you should have amazing wings. Have tried the wings here several times (as we live in the neighbourhood) and have always left disappointed. St.Louis or Bistro on Avenue are much much better. 2 stars for atmosphere though. Nice patio and nice large screens to watch sporting events."}
{"text":"We tried the \"wet\" wings and were extremely disappointed. There was barely any sauce on them at all, and the flavor of the medium and hot sauces were lacking. Maybe if we tried the \"double dipped\" wings the quality of the sauce may have improved? On another note, the fries that came with the wings were AMAZING! The best item we ate from there and definitely worth the extra $1!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The service was mediocre, the management dealt with situations poorly and the food was average at most. My wife and I heard about the restaurant from a neighbour and decided to go on a whim with our two kids seeing as it was conveniently in the neighbourhood. Walking in the atmosphere was immediately seen as sketchy, with drunks loud at the bar, (hardly an appropriate place for the neighbourhood) lighting so darkly dimmed and the servers who reeked of cigarettes, it was hardly appealing and I should have walked back out the door right then and there. Our food took forty minutes and the server was hardly apologetic, when we asked to briefly speak to the manager she simply stated that the resturant was busy and there was a slight back up in the kitchen, without and offer to reimburse us. Tip for management; if your food is going to take longer than twenty five minutes (standard in most restaurants) then please advise your guests that it will take longer then usual BEFORE THEN SIT DOWN. This place is out of character for such a family oriented neighbourhood and will not return, especially not encourage those of the neighbourhood to not endure such a dingy setting. I'm aware it has the same owners of safari, however it seems that restaurant as well as gone significantly down hill."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and beer is a plenty. Burgers are good and the wings are tasty. Sat in the bar area a few times. When packed this place moves s-l-o-w-l-y as there never seems to be enough staff on hand. Also my wife and I have ordered takeout on a few occasions and they've messed up the order twice. To their credit they did resolve the issue but I had to drive back to the restaurant each time which was an absolute pain. They need to teak a few things in order to get a better score but we'll use them again..."}
{"text":"I'm not a wings guy but my wife enjoys it. Lots of sauces and the servers were friendly. Good place to watch a hockey game."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place based on a blogTo post. However, i can literally name tons of other places with much better wings. Has potential, nice ambience. However the staff seemed to have no urgency and i literally had to walk to the bar multiple times to get what i want. Wings seemed like a real small portion. The dill and fries were the highlight...if that says anything."}
{"text":"Visited on Mon May 19, was surprised to find this place open on Victoria Day. A handful of people were there, we sat on the patio. We ordered the double-dipped wings, which are wings which are baked in one flavour, and then fried with a second flavour. I have never tried this before, and this should be a huge reason to come to this place! We had two pounds one was \"The Angry Mexican\" (Tequila Lime then Hot) and \"The Hoser Eh!\" (Maple and Rye Spiked BBQ Sauce, dusting of double smoked candied bacon). The server said The Hoser Eh recently won some wing competition award. The service was excellent, food was excellent. That afternoon there were 3 patrons on the patio that were arguing loudly for over 20min, they almost started to fight. Aside from that, would definitely come back again. There is pay and display parking along Avenue Road."}
{"text":"Bartender was super nice. Great patio. I had dry wings with rajun Buffalo double dip wings. These wings are fried then grilled. Different than traditional batterie wings. A little softer and smokier. I liked them.   Worth a drop in for lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"The menu is very hard to read and to look at. It looks like a kid made it and honestly, staring at it too long will give you a headache. I recommend visiting the website before heading to the restaurant. The service was very slow. We were well done our appetizer and waiting for our wings to arrive. Once the food arrived, it was good. I was happy with my food. I would go back because the slow service and ugly menu doesn't really affect how the food tasted. It was also cool that I could order just flats or just drums."}
{"text":"This place is good for a snack.  About 5-6 beers on tap, wings are not too bad.  I actually really enjoyed the patio, it is large, there is stuff to look at on the street.  Word of advice to management, find out where the wasp nest is in vicinity of your patio and get rid of it.  I would say within 2 minutes of receiving the wings there was about 6 wasps hovering around us and never left.  Side note- I embarrassed myself in front of the restaurant trying to parallel park in a tight spot.  I had out of province plates so I am sure no one took me holding up traffic too seriously."}
{"text":"My pal and I wanted to meet up on Thursday night, but didn't want to go somewhere too far from home. It was my first time at DNF, but it was like the fifth time for my pal.   We got in around 9:30 to the sounds of live music - the guy was pretty good at singing a variety of covers. It's a little inconvenient to get to by TTC, but if you're driving, there's a very small lot in the back of the restaurant and some parking spots on Avenue Road (Green P). I noticed a patio; I will have to check this place out again in the summer after (gross) winter.   Drinks - Drums N Flats has both a bar and a dining area. Their drinks menu is extensive and they have daily drink specials. I'm on antibiotics so I wasn't listening to the deal of the day on Thursday night, but it sounded like a good one.  Food - We ordered a pizza initially. My pal and I were chatting so we didn't notice the amount of time it was taking. Luckily our server did and she offered an appetizer on the house for the 'inconvenience' (good service). The pizza came soon after; it was a-okay. Our server came often to see how we were doing and providing us with refills.  Drums N Flats isn't too far from home so I will definitely be back for a casual outing with friends who live in my neighborhood.   Good for: drinks, live music, late eats"}
{"text":"You're not coming here to diet.  You're not coming here to eat salad.  You're not coming here to stay sober.  You're coming to eat wings and drink beer. 'Nuff said.  Get the double flavored wings for a bit of awesome - the BBQ and chili lime wings were surprisingly amazing. Had to come back a second time before I left Toronto."}
{"text":"Service is awful and the wings are nothing special. Tons of other spots in the area to grab a beer and food. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Bistro on Avenue schools this place. The atmosphere at Drums N Flats is definitely a bit better, but the chicken wings are most certainly worse. If you are looking to grab a pint, Drums N Flats is a good place to go (Except for their brutal beer selection). If you are looking for some good wings.... take a few steps north on Avenue to Bistro - a legendary Toronto wing spot."}
{"text":"This is a local go-to for me. The atmosphere is great and the wings are the best in the area. The service is spot on too.   Whether I'm dining in or taking out, this is where I go for wings in the area.   PS: get the onion ring tower"}
{"text":"I was very impressed, almost ecstatic, at the quality of food Drums N Flats provided as an UberEats order. My quest was for delivery of wings that were extra spicy and they did not disappoint with their \"Insane Heat that will blow your face off\" wings (we ordered regular, not the double-dipped they offer). Wings arrived hot and plentiful and the spice was just perfect. Watered the eyes, but didn't create full panic mode. What a true \"suicide sauce\" should taste like (hotter than just Franks Xtra Hot). Wings are a good size too.  Also ordered the Mick burger and it was fantastic. A basic double cheese burger like you'd get at a back yard BBQ. Simple and so delicious. Fries were home cut with the skins still on. Had to toast them up in the toaster oven because of the delivery and the cold weather, but they were perfectly salted and crispy. Tons of leftovers. They did put dill instead of blue cheese for the dipping sauce, but I like them both do it didn't bother me.   Some people have written about the big boxes and little portions, but I can guarantee the portions inside are exactly what you would get at the restaurant. My only regret is having driven by this place so many times for over ten years and never trying them. Will definitely be ordering again and will check out the patio in the warm weather."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the wings I tried here and so did my boyfriend who was pleased to get them a little drier than saucy. We came in on a Saturday for a late lunch around 2pm. It wasn't too busy, it was clean and service was pleasant and quick. I hope this place succeeds b/c we need more wings places beyond the usual chains in North York. This place is family friendly (we saw two families enjoying themselves) and they have some good salads, burgers, fish & chips and desserts on the menu including Kawartha Dairy Ice Cream. We will be back to sample some more wings! Hopefully, more sauce options for the wings will be added in the future!"}
{"text":"This is your classic bar. The food is good, the service is always nice and they have a lot of tvs to watch the game. The only complaint is the prices are a tad high but other than that 3.5/5."}
{"text":"This place was great for about three months, then went downhill so fast we've sworn it off completely. Our last order of takeout wings were so soggy and underdone, we tried pan frying them up again at home before just tossing them and eating something edible. Two stars because there was a brief time that this place was good, and maybe they'll recapture that; but the problems seem like those of cheap, shortsighted ownership, rather than just careless staff."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!! I heard the owner screaming at his staff....my food came out with a huge hair in it and the owner basically told me I was lying and did not take the food back ....waited 1.5 hour for my food to come out also  this place is probably the worst food and service ever avoid please"}
{"text":"Went to see a band and have dinner. Sat in the back, in a corner where it was impossible to see the band. Had reservations and told there were no other seats, yet tables were open. On to the food. Ordered a chicken burger. It is not a chicken breast, but ground chicken and didn't taste of anything. Fries are pretty standard.  Being called Drums n'Flats, you would think the wings are where it's at, but no. I've ordered them a few times and find them very average.   I asked for some hot sauce, and when I got the bill, I was charged $1.00 for it!!!!! They also charge a cover, even if you're eating, and arrived before the band starts.  Overall, very mediocre food, and policies that are focused on getting a few extra bucks from everyone.  I'll avoid this place in the future. Plenty of other options."}
{"text":"Opt for the double dipped wings... While the wings are tiny the flavours are huge!  The ragin' Cajun and tequila lime were the best flavours by far.  The wings overall are a 3.5/5 but the deep fried banana split pushed my rating to an overall 4.  Make sure you leave too for dessert!"}
{"text":"After ordering the uber eats and paying $14.00 for apparent \"home made beer batter fish\" myself and fellow firefighters were all very disappointed. The portions were way to small for what they charge. You can tell the batter is not beer battered at all. At least when you get the delivery the box that the food comes in it is big enough to give you false hope of a good meal........"}
{"text":"The reason we chose to eat here is because Drums N Flats is listed on the Buffalo Bills Backers website (as well as making claims on their website) as being the home bar for the Toronto Bills Backers.  It's not.  We were able to watch the game on the big screen, but when I mentioned to our waitress that this was listed as being the Bills Backers bar, she had no idea what I was talking about. This was a pricey cab ride here from downtown.  And in all honestly, had this place not been listed as the Bills Backers bar for Toronto, we wouldn't have chosen it.  I was looking forward to some socializing, and besides us, there was maybe two other tables occupied while we were there. Minus a star.   But, after the meal, I was glad we ate there. The wings, while on the small side, were cooked perfectly and were dripping with sauce. The sweet potato fries were simple and tasty.  I picked a Molson on draft, and my husband had a draft local cider.  He'd never had it before and enjoyed it a lot.  Our waitress, was the bomb.  She kept us entertained and was a pleasure to talk to.  My only thing (and this seemed to be wide spread in Toronto) is if you're mobility impaired, you won't be able to use the rest room.  It's down a flight of stairs in the basement and I didn't see an elevator."}
{"text":"Really looking forward to trying this place out and left slightly disappointed.   I went there for wings (of course) and really liked the idea of being able to pick only drums or flats (or both), especially since the wife is strictly a flats kind of gal.   Unfortunately the wings and the sauce didnt measure up. They are a great size, ill give them that, but unfortunately they were dry (like they have been par-cooked) and their sauces were to be desired, for my tastes. Not to mention the very weak amount of sauce on the wing to begin with. And to make matters worse, we asked for extra celery and carrots for an extra charge (which is fine) and got exactly two dried out, thin sliced carrots and celery.   Anyway, if were ever in the area and craving wings, we may give them another shot. In the meantime, there are many, many better spots for wings in the area and the City."}
