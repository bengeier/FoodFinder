{"text":"Your average little Chinese joint but large portions. My friend would say less than average but this my review..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing General Tso's Chicken, sauce was watered down and meat was stringy."}
{"text":"Ho Ho Cherry House is the best place for a quick, tasty lunch! Usually they have two specials, one vegetarian and one meat, that run between $3.99 and $4.99. We generally just order one of both and always have extra to chow down on later. We religiously order from Ho Ho at least 5x a month and love that they deliver, too!"}
{"text":"The Cherry House is a solid choice for affordable Chinese take out. You get large portions of yummy food and the quality is always A-OK. They have a pretty good sized menu. I'm a fan of their szechuan bean curd. It' great when I need a quick meal.

There are a good bit of seat's inside, though I have never seen them very packed. The interior is as decorated as one would expect, but no matter, your there for the food right?"}
{"text":"This place has really good quality food for the usually low standards of Chinese cuisine. They always have big portions, which really came in handy for me and my roommate this weekend. We live close by (like less than a mile), so we had them deliver right at the start of their workday on Sunday.  The delivery fee is only $1 if you live close enough. Good quality and good service always from Ho Ho Cherry House. The prices are average however..."}
{"text":"just ordered lunch..egg drop soup is GREAT. the texture is just how i like it...excited for this sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"Ordered from ho ho last night. I ordered the cherry special chicken and it was pretty good. Portions were good, food was fresh and HOT. Although the chicken was very sweet. My 5yo enjoyed it and the warm, sweet cherries that were mixed in. I won't order the cherry chicken again unless I have a sweet tooth. I plan to order lunch today and I'll just get my regular (sweet and sour chicken with crab rangoon). I want to try the garlic chicken but I'd like someone to tell me about their experience eating it. This has become my fav Chinese spot.. There's one across the street from where I live. They used to be good but now they're just horrible. Ho Ho Is the place!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Christmas Eve as a new family tradition and was happy with the decision. I ordered the veggie dish with white rice. The veggies were great but I prefer sticky rice so didn't enjoy the rice as much. This is our new go to for nearby Chinese."}
{"text":"This place has really fallen off. Oredered delivery and couldn't have screwed up the order more. This twice in a row. Used to be good pretty terrible now"}
{"text":"A mediocre Chinese experience. Food was decent but delivery was 40 minutes late and the food was cold. Also, requested brown rice but received white. I will definitely give them another shot though."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a decent chinese place around plaza midwood for some time, and I finally found this gem. It's a typical quick chinese place that offers all the standard chinese food options, and the food is very tasty. Quick, reasonable$, and tasty: this is my go to chinese spot"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sesame  chicken combo. Along with  crab ragoon and an extra egg roll. Everything was delicious. I have no complaints. The lady who took my order was pleasant and the delivery guy wasn't bad either. Very easy. No complications. I would order from this establishment again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Old school Americanized Chinese Food. But with fresh veggies and the food is always delivered Hot and Fresh."}
{"text":"Good cheap Chinese food. Close to home, so it's a winner with me. Always friendly, pretty consistent quality."}
{"text":"Food was 35 mins late. Everything was not in my order on delivery. Mongolian beef was filled with all onions (for filler). Never again. Nothing but excuses from this place when called to ask."}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out lunch from here, but it has yet to disappoint me....weekly specials are key @ $5 with tax included. I always receive my food correctly, and piping hot. The lunch portions are enough to feed at least two. The lo mein could probably serve three. 

Interior isn't much to look at, but the food makes up for lack of appearance. Staff always seem friendly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 because I am giving Ho Ho Cherry House the benefit of the doubt. 

Why, you may ask? Well, ask yourself this. How many crappy Chinese take out places have you been to/ordered from in Charlotte? \"Too many,\" you say? Exactly. That's why Ho Ho Cherry House is deserving of 4 stars! It's reliable and fills that Chinese food craving that we all have with great food. It blows away the Chinese takeout competition in Charlotte easily.

Pros: Good prices, pretty good portions, delivery radius is pretty big compared to other delivery places, food was solid

Cons: Delivery took a while, took about 1 hour 30 mins when the expected time was 1 hour, so the food was not as crispy as it should be

Recommend: General Tso's chicken (pretty hard to mess this one up), crab rangoons, fried chicken wings

Long story short: Good, reliable Chinese take out in Charlotte which, from my experiences, is quite rare. I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Ho Ho Cherry House a couple times because its right up the street from our house. On a recent visit to pick up our order, I happened to notice there was a coupon in their to go menu I had picked up.  The coupon was spend 15, get 5 off. I asked the MANAGER, \"hey, can we please use this coupon?\"  The manager said, \"did you just pick that up off my counter?\" Playfully I said, \"umm, noooo\" thinking there was no way he was going to deny us the coupon.. (remember, talking to the manager, not a teenager in the front.)  He then proceeded to tell us that no we couldn't use the coupon, and we would have to take the coupon home, cut it, and use it on our next visit. 

I said I couldn't believe that, and that if there was some sort of parameter of that sense it should be clearly stated on the to-go menu. When he finally refused, I said under my breath, \"guess we'll be going down the street to 88 Bistro.\" to which he had the nerve to reply, \"yeah, I heard that place is great, have you been?\" What a jackass. If directly disrespecting your customers is how you run your business, then I will be happy to support your competitor."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 4, arrived at 510, so no points for quickness, as a result it arrived lukewarm. No silverware or chopsticks, which meant I was eating it with my hands because I was at a hotel. Wings were pretty big, but the rest was disappointing...Egg drop soup had a weird aftertaste. General Tso's came as heavily breaded tiny scraps of chicken, soaked in sauce, and only two small pieces of soggy broccoli, at the bottom. Entree, wings and soup came to $20, so not great value either. I'm glad others had such great food here, but I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Very quick service, friendly, and accurate, but at the end of the meal you realize that gee, it's just kind of bland. We keep going back because we can count on them to be there, but it's not really what I love about Chinese food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give 1 star but it's the lowest you can give. I had to call back after an hour and a half to inquire about my order. The person on the phone said the driver is ready to go home so how much do you plan to tip? I not so calmly said you can cancel the order! We know that this place has mediocre food but no clue that they had way below average customer service. Never again. Fortune cookie to the rescue"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I hate when reviewers slam a place for something minor.  This is an important forum for their business to succeed so when people overreact negatively to something minor it's unfair.  That said, they also need to be mindful of that and handle customer service accordingly.  I think I was actually being generous with the second star.

So for the service, it's far less about making a mistake vs how you propose to resolve it.  Ordering the dinner combo comes with a side.  Mine didn't show up in my delivery order.  When I called to notify and seek out a resolution, my options were pick it up (probably wouldn't have paid for delivery if I felt like heading out for a forgotten portion of my order) or have a credit to receive what I ordered for now, at a later time of purchase.   When I asked for something that would actually resolve this (have someone send it out, give me a credit for an appetizer in the future, refund delivery fee, etc I was told nothing could be done.

The food was primarily bleh.  Ordered two spicy dishes and asked for extra spicy on both.  Sha cha and Kung Pao.  Neither was spicy at all.  Very bland.  Fried rice with dinner combo tasted like a very minimal effort toward fried rice, otherwise pretty close to white rice.  The other dish my wife ordered Sesame Chicken, was good which deserved to be noted.  Also do provide large portions so definitely more than one meal so plenty to share, have leftovers, if you get something worth finishing.

Some things done right but looking for a go to Chinese restaurant they won't be close to making the cut.  If the service had been handled correctly, I would've sought out other dishes that could have been done well but I'm not interested in missing parts of my order and having to try em yet again to get everything I paid for."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for over a decade and always ordered from here. The food seemed as if it was slipping lately and we found another place nearby that also delivers. All I can say is Holy crap! I've been ordering from the wrong place entirely. Cherry house has stale meats, floating in awful, thick, flavorless brown goo. The spring rolls taste like they were frozen twice, and even the fortune cookies were rubbery. This place is just terrible. Thank goodness I'm recovering from the flu and didn't feel like going out. I never would have discovered what I've been missing all these years. This is not good food, even for takeout. You'd be far better off going to the grocery store and buying the store brand 'beef with broccoli' and some frozen egg rolls. At least they wouldn't be slathered in sauce that prisoners wouldn't eat."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is always fresh and tasty!!! This is my go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"I wanted a mild meal on the way home from a medical procedure. I was so thankful to be able order and pay for some delicious Ho Ho Cherry wonton soup and fried rice from my car. My husband was able to run inside to pick it up in about 10 minutes. Very convenient and yummy!"}
{"text":"Portions are generous however I feel the food lacks flavor.  We had wonton soup which was good, seafood dumplings that were fried but bland. Lacked a crunch.  I had the happy family and it required soy sauce and taking it home to doctor it up."}
{"text":"It's good, cheap Chinese. That's it, no frills, nothing fancy. Quick and friendly service when picking up. Dinner combinations are cheap, soup and entrees are good. It's the best in the area for when you really need takeout."}
{"text":"Food arrived earlier than expected.  It was hot and very tasty.  We were very impressed with the quality of the food. We will definitely order from them again in the future."}
{"text":"Delivery took over an hour. When it finally arrived the orange chicken sauce was too spicy and the chicken was overcooked and dry. After 10 years of ordering here I wonder if it is under new management. It has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I'm feeling a little inspired since I've been up all night listening to Slug (from Atmosphere) , so I think I'm going to rap this next review...Wanna Hear it, here it go.
(While you read this just think of a phat bass line with some cool scratch effects wherever.ever..ever.ever...you see fit)

Cherry House Chinese.... 
You get my vote  with ease.

-But seriously its really damn good. Fresh shrimp in the Lo Mien, not too much flavoring, (it had just enough), but you know how some Chinese places OD on the MSG, not here. And the portions are huge. Cherry House is inexpensive,scrumpt-didly-umptious, and they deliver. The Spicy chicken came with a ton of rice, not as much chicken as I would have liked but still very good, and spicy, watch out for the chili peppers, they'll burn ya."}
{"text":"So, I ordered Cherry House because it is the only Chinese place that delivers to my apartment complex and my boyfriend insisted we eat Chinese food for the opening ceremonies of the Olympics.  Yep, he's a big dork.  I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with my standard veggie lo mein while the bf ventured out and had the Cherry Special Chicken.  We also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon.

Well, the lo mein, first of all, was not lo mein at all.  It was actually chow mein and that did not really work for me since I prefer the wide, flat noodle usually found in lo mein dishes.  It was fairly bland and the veggies were scarce.   I mean, c'mon, it's veggie lo mein!  Give me something here!  The crab rangoon filling was nothing short of disgusting....it tasted like either ricotta cheese or curdled, mealy cream cheese.  Yuck!

The Cherry Special Chicken, however, was pretty darn tasty.  I ended up sharing with the bf because his food was way better than mine.  The sauce was a sweet/spicy combo and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried (i.e. not too greasy).  The only downside:  the cherries were of the marischino variety and tasted just like what you would expect: like they came from the bottom of a Shirley Temple.  Overly sweet and not so appetizing.  

A mixed review all in all.....maybe if I branched out and tried something different, but I think next time, I will just go pick it up from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cherry House is one of my few go-to take out places. The dining area isn't much to enjoy, but you can depend on consistent yummy take-out. Service is super fast.

I recommend the sesame tofu with broccoli. Menu is vegetarian friendly and almost any meat dish can be substituted with tofu. I'm definitely partial to Cherry House because their egg rolls, rather than spring rolls are vegetarian. Yay! 

FYI - take out menu has coupons on the back!"}
{"text":"This was my go to Chinese place in Charlotte.  As others have said, it's quick and inexpensive.  And don't forget tasty!!"}
{"text":"I've lived around the corner for two years and every time I go it's always delicious. The portions are big, and it's super reasonably priced. dining room is nothing fancy but you're here for the food right? :) Cherry house has always been a positive experience for me, 2 thumbs up. I ordered the General tso's dinner combo (chicken, rice, egg roll). I ordered it with a sprite and a side of sweet and sour! Cost me $12"}
{"text":"I really like this place because it has a more unique and exotic selection than most Chinese restaurants.  I've always been a big fan of sesame chicken and this place really does it right.  I know that doesn't sound very exotic, but it's what I like.  They get your food to you very quickly, which makes it a nice place to come if you're in a rush.  The only real down side is that the dining area is kind of small to actually sit and eat in, but it's perfect for take out."}
{"text":"Completely I'll-informed person working the phones refused to deliver to our address claiming it was 6 miles away when it was .5. I had already paid and they refused to refund. I kept trying to tell them they were wrong and they refused to work with me. I'm out $26 and dinner, and I'm still only half a mile away. They refused to make it and let me pick up without charging me again. They should be embarrassed at their \"customer service.\" Incompetent staff unfortunately. Will never use this place, or beyond menu app again."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. Ho Ho has saved me countless times. WAY better than average Chinese food. Not greasy. Crispy foods remain crispy, so good."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food spot! Just moved in down the street and had a great first experience! Ordered delivery and they arrived within 10 minutes. The delivery guy was super sweet and called when he arrived. Great service! And of course, the food was super delicious!"}
{"text":"Same thing, different day.  I always get it to go.  Lunch special this week was spicy garlic chicken for 4.20.  Not that spicy and only somewhat garlicy.  I would complain about too much onions and not enough chicken, but at that price I should be scared of a lot of chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was satisfied. Got here ten minutes earlier than promised. Good portions for the prices. The chicken egg roll wasn't very good and the crab wontons were just filled with cream cheese. The sesame chicken was spot on and the Mongolian beef was the best we ever had. The beef was tender and super flavorful. Only complaint would be too many onions with it. Also got pork lo mein and shrimp fried rice. Both had decent amounts of protein and fresh veggies. This will become our regular Chinese place."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place, my favorite to order from around Uptown. Highly recommend the beef lo mein and the general tso chicken."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Ho Ho and order takeout close to once per week.  They always have a lunch/dinner combo special that changes weekly.  It's a great value at $6 total after tax.  This it's the best Chinese, but I've never been disappointed.  They even allowed me to substitute red for green peppers the last time I ordered the special, cool!  It's the perfect \"neighborhood Chinese takeout/delivery\" place."}
{"text":"i love their seafood soup its the best
tofu pieces, scallop, shrimp lobster and crab all in one soup.
eggdrop soup, crab rangoon, and lo mein are a must if you go!

yummm"}
{"text":"Picked up a take out for quick lunch on the run.it was cheap but I got what I paid for. It was theory tasteless love me in I've ever eaten. Boiled pasta would have had more flavor. I could have drowned it in soy sauce but that would have added insult to injury. Next time I'm in a hurry I'll just stop for a fast food burger."}
{"text":"General tsao's chicken for take-out lunch broke the plastic fork I was using.  I probably caught them on an off-day."}
{"text":"I don't generally like to review restaurants that I've only eaten at once since that hardly seems fair to me, and I will be up front, I have only eaten here once, but I'm not in a terrible hurry to repeat since I've found better Chinese which is closer to my house.

We went here on my roommate's request. He had the Chicken and Broccoli (He ALWAYS has the chicken and broccoli!) and seemed to enjoy. We split an order of crab rangoon and it was pretty decent too. It wasn't exactly complex in flavor, but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste. 

What was not excusable, and really what is prompting me to write this review, was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg, no pork, no nothing) but cabbage that smelled, not mildly, of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean). I was very disappointed.

It should be said that the service was good and, as I said before, I have only eaten here once. You can pay your money and take your chances on the fact that I was there on an off night or that they will be more to your liking. I will be getting my Chinese food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good, convenient take out at a low price. Nothing particularly great nor terrible about this place. Food was average."}
{"text":"Got takeout from Cherry House twice, and was disgusted that shrimp found its way into my vegetarian dishes both times... The taste and smell of seafood makes me want to yack, and they screwed up twice! Cross contaminate once, shame on you. Cross contaminate twice, shame on me! This place is literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back again."}
{"text":"It was Christmas Day and I had no plans until 3 pm and I was hungry.  Thank you Cherry House for being open.
I had anticipated it would be counter service so I was glad to know it was table service since I was not in a hurry to be anywhere.  
I started with the Egg Drop Soup.  It was very good.  It was the right texture and not overly salty like some places.  
My entree was Shrimp Mei Fun.  I love rice noodles, but I don't think I've ever had this dish anywhere.  It was a generous portion of rice noodles with bits of scrambled egg and shrimp.  Not really a sauce so that was a plus in my book.  The noodles were cooked just right.  The shrimp maybe could have been cooked 30 seconds less, but still good. 
The service was very attentive, but there was only 1 other table.  It will definitely be on my list for when I want table service Chinese.  Not sure if it's worth the drive to Elizabeth when there are other Chinese restaurants near me, but good."}
{"text":"I had the best General Tso's chicken and fried rice. Great flavor for a great price. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. Good prices.  I love the Chicken and Broc.  Generals Chicken is good too. This is a staple in my diet since I live so close!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be decent. Cheap Chinese takeout.. food for a lazy weekend or something, but it has gotten to be AWFUL. Like take a bite and throw away awful. We had spring rolls and they tasted like old garbage or something? They were SO gross. 

The dumplings were tolerable but barely.. it was like a don't want to waste money kind of thing. I put them in the toaster oven and dabbed off some grease and they were a lot less gross. 

The general tso's chicken was ok, but dry and kind of clumpy. 

I was kind of scared of getting sick eating the food because of how weird everything tasted. I don't know what changed but definitely will not eat there again!"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap, pretty good. They offer delivery in a certain areas (so call to verify). Delivery was non-stop the night I went in and a few dining in.

The space was small and the restaurant smelled of their seafood dishes. The service was good and fast."}
{"text":"WARNING: This place is not safe for anyone with NUT ALLERGIES! I placed a delivery order online today at 7:21pm. My order was quoted 45-60 mins. At 8:50 my door bell finally rang. The driver hands me a receipt and there is no tip line. He said you have to do that before online. Why would I place a tip online before I receive a service? How do I know how much I will tip? My order took long than was quoted so I am glad I didn't tip while placing my order. I called to check on my order before the delivery arrived and the women I spoke with was very rude, she had a serious attitude with me. 

NOW ON TO THE BIG ISSUE: I have a severe peanut and treenut allergy. I ordered Chicken LoMein and noted my allergy in the comment box. When I got my dinner I took 3 bites and I could already feel an allergic reaction!! If you can't accommodate an allergy then you should have called an informed me! My allergy is a life or death situation for me, I am prone to anaphylactic reactions! This isn't something to joke around with and I would say the liability is one them for not informing me that it wouldn't be safe!!! 

NEVER AGAIN WILL I WASTED MY MONEY ON THE OVERPRICED FOOD OR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"The delivery service was super fast. Less than10 minutes after we placed our order! They delivered exactly what we ordered and it was hot and delicious. We will definitely order again and try more items on their large menu. Very pleased with this restaurant and their delivery service. The online ordering was very easy to use.
This order of food was very good.  I will continue to monitor quality in the upcoming months.

 I did reorder delivery again and was a bit disappointed in my meal.  It was delivered on time, but the quality was not a good as before.  The generals chicken was a bit dry and the opther chicken dish was equally dry.  In the future I plan to stay away from the chicken"}
{"text":"Ordered some food from here to go one evening, not the best but not the worst either. I was more pleased with some items rather than others. We ordered the veggie lo mein which was pretty good and I enjoyed it. The vegetable fried rice was ok but all around pretty bland I thought. We ordered their veggie rolls which were just terrible. The flavor was awful and the wrap was so soft and had no crunch, I couldn't even finish eating one of them. We also ordered the sesame tofu which was honestly the best part of the entire meal and pretty impressive. It tasted just like ordering sesame chicken only tofu instead. I would def. eat some things from here again but I wouldn't jump at the chance either."}
{"text":"Best steamed dumplings EVERRRRR (in excited Oprah voice)! Ho Ho Cherry House is a reliable neighborhood Chinese restaurant that does primarily takeout/delivery business. Service is generally very quick and friendly. 

The menu is pretty long and features standard fare. The dumplings are always perfectly steamed and they usually throw in a couple more than the count says on the menu. Some of the fried foods can be a little on the oily side. Online ordering is definitely a bonus! 

P.S. They have coupons on the Clipper app sometimes, though the app is not user friendly."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing!  We love the crab ragoons!  Always super quick delivery!!"}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time so I figured I'd finally try it out. Ordered some General Tso's takeout. It is very small and intimate inside, smaller than I expected. Was able to get in and out quickly though as my food was hot and ready to go once I arrived. 

Nothing was mind blowing about the experience. Great portions, got two meals out of it. Wasn't a big fan of the egg rolls. Fortune cookie said I had a future in medicine, so I'm applying to some new schools. All told, a good take out option when you don't feel like cooking but want some solid Asian food without the sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Quick takeout. One of the better chinese places in Elizabeth/midtown area."}
{"text":"NO NO CHERRY HOUSE. Cmon Ho Ho. You're better than this. I placed my order about 2 hours ago and I just learned that it has yet to leave the restaurant because Ho Ho only has one driver tonight. This is basic stuff, Ho Ho. Restaurants as established as yourself shouldn't be making rookie moves like this. Giving y'all two stars cuz I have hopes that when the food does arrive, it will be delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre fried rice had zero salt was tasteless general tso sauce is good but the chicken had too much batter and not enough chicken tasted rubbery."}
{"text":"Use to love this place, but literally the last 4 times I have placed a take out order they have messed it up. Sometime I'm missing items. Other times I'm missing an item and I get something entirely different instead. This last time I got home and had sauce all over every container due to them loading too many things on top of one another. Time to find another Chinese spot..."}
{"text":"Love this place...for almost two years it has been my go-to place for great Chinese food. The best in Charlotte"}
{"text":"There are 3 main ingredients in a good restaurant; Taste, atmosphere, service.  I ordered orange chicken and a Coke. I was expecting of course a glass of coke. But I got a can instead. I thought that was weird, but not inexcusable or Off-putting. The orange chicken though... was very crispy (which I like) , but the sauce was just utterly gross. It tasted like someone mixed corn syrup with corn starch (and went heavy on the corn starch). The broccoli that serves as a bed/garnish for the orange chicken was not only un-steamed and raw, but cold and actually frostbitten. The inside was dimly lit and the only somewhat good service we got was after I checked in on Yelp in a way that the waitress could see me. Very rude staff of 2 people and pretty bad food. Also, not a comfortable restaurant. I hate to leave bad reviews on local businesses, but I also hate to be served terrible food by rude waitresses in a poorly lit, uncomfortable restaurant."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with food here.   They came recommended but I will not go back.  The egg rolls where store bought, the rice had a chemical test, and the vegetables looked also rotted.   Canned soda no refills.  Would not recommend.  I went with someone who would recommend the place and he says they have fallen very far.  The health code rating has also fallen from a 96 to a 91."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte and was looking for a good Chinese place. I was very disappointed in the food. The lo main was flavorless and the crab rangoon had almost no filling in it. They were essentially fried wontons, not crab rangoon. The food was luke warm when it arrived and we live about 2 minutes from the place. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I gave Ho Ho Cherry an extra chance to keep me on there customer list. But I get the impression they do not care..I know owner or mgmt changed since 2016. I have had Moo Goo one of my childhood favorites,delivered in some sort of brown gravy, I was 6old that was how they make it despite the menu claims white sauce. So that fell from fave list quick.. Back in June I ordered Egg Foo young and not only did it come with beef broth instead of the gravy,only 1 patty eatable the other was burnt and I thought it came with 3 patties? So despite those fudges I got a taste for fried rice yesterday, easy simple I didn't feel like making it they make it all day long can't go wrong. Boy  was I wrong! What's the special of the day pork fried rice I have never had dry tasteless lacking ingredients fried rice before in my life the rice was dry and I mean dry dry it was Bland even with the meat and little bit of peas and onions it had no flavor I couldn't help thinking what did I just spend $6 on that I could have made at home. I had all the ingredients I just didn't feel like making the mess I'll smelling it so I learned the lesson that's it that's the third strike after seven years since 2010 I'm finally throwing out my takeout menus for ho ho Cherry House never again. It took them 9months to undo 7 years of patronage.. A friend laughed at me and told me I need to try anywhere else.. oh gave them 1 star for having me out in less than 5mins"}
{"text":"Food was meh. Nothing to write home about and pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprise by my visit to the Cherry House. After reading the reviews here, which are very mixed, I figured what the hell. Can't be worse than what happened to Hong Kong Chinese (read my previous review for that story).
When I first walked in I was surprised by the cleanliness, and how well put together the interior looked, nicely decorated without going over the top. 
My wife and I were greeted at the counter and took a minute to look over the menu.
I went with one of their \"house specials\" the spicy tangerine chicken, ordered with white rice, and an egg roll for $7. Not bad at all. The wife went with good ol' beef lo-mein. 
Everything was really good, seemed fresh, and had great flavor. This is slowly becoming one of my fav take out Chinese places around. Ho Ho Cherry House has my vote!"}
{"text":"While Cherry House might not have the most exquisite Chinese food ever, it's solid and cheap. It's one of my favorite buffets. They have a great deal for their takeout lunch buffet...it's around $4, and they give you the takeout box. You fill it up as much as you can! As long as you can close the box, it's the same price. I've stuffed one of those boxes so full that I ate leftovers for a week!

Sometimes the lo mein is a little dry or other items look like they might have that not-so-fresh feeling...but I can forgive a lack of culinary perfection for the fabulous prices."}
{"text":"Delivery was excellent,  and arrived piping hot. When I ordered and it was stated delivery would be at least 40 minutes I had my reservations. But the food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the \" brown sauce\" was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously, don't go here."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's the only place I order my Chinese takeout from. I've tried a few different things....lo mein, fried rice, egg and spring rolls and typical chicken dishes. But my all time favorite and consistent go to is their sesame chicken! It is delicious!!! Also really loved their egg rolls. I definitely will be ordering again...this review comes after my 3rd order.  

Update: Last time I ordered, my food was a hour late and stone cold. Not even joking...I had to reheat it. I called and spoke with a manager (something I NEVER do, honestly my sister ended up calling cause I'm really not one to complain even with bad service - character flaw I guess lol) who apologized and said they'd issue a refund. Issue was they never did! So sad, cause now I really don't care to order from them again and their food is actually delicious....when it's hot."}
{"text":"Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.

US CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \"CHOW MEIN\":
I learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?

At Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.

That said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse."}
{"text":"I mean, you know, it's \"Chinese.\" It's cheap. It's fast. You can even order online. And, it's good. Tonight I had the hot and sour soup and sa cha chicken. I couldn't even get to my chicken because the soup filled me up. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Atleast most crappy Chinese takeout has flavor. All the food was super bland and just simply not good. Had food delivered so I understand there is some draw backs but none of the food was good"}
{"text":"The food was average. Dumplings we're deep fried not pan fried. Happy Family was on par with buffet style flavor. Place itself is run down and needs updating. The service is HORRIBLE! 

I only came here because of Groupon Offer. I will never come back to this establishment again. 

It may serve your needs if all you're looking for is cheap Chines take out or delivery."}
{"text":"No frills Chinese spot. The staff is friendly and my food has always been right, without any mistakes. I always order a take out of their honey wings with veg. lo mein or fried rice and I'm always pleased. Wings are crispy and lo mein /fried rice has a good rice-to-veggie ratio. Honey wing sauce is not too sweet and coats the wings well. 

Although I can say that I have had better Chinese food, they are quick, convenient, & always satisfy the craving & for that I rock with them!"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery. Blazing fast. I was told about 45 minutes and they were at my door in 20. The food was good. Nothing special, like any other Chinese take Out place. I find it very hard to review these types of take-out places as I feel they all cook from the same ingrediënten list. Anyways, if you are looking for descent quick Chinese take out with a bubbly delivery guy, this is the place to be :)"}
{"text":"All I'm saying is that I'm glad we tried this place for lunch. Cause this can't be the last taste in my mouth for the day!.................."}
{"text":"Bought a voucher on LivingSocial and decided to dine here and I'm so glad I did!! I will definitely eat from here again. The food was fresh and delicious & the service was awesome. The prices and quality of food is well worth it. Great spot for inexpensive vittles."}
{"text":"Ordered sesame chicken, hot & sour soup, crab Rangoon & steamed dumplings. I did not receive my egg roll with the combo which wasn't that big of a deal but The sesame chicken was stringy, chewie & inedible. I called to get a refund for the only the sesame chicken & I was told that they couldn't refund my card & they would bring me back cash but they would bring it to when when they could... estimated time 1-2 hours. The girl at the other end of the phone proceeded to tell me that my request for a refund was pissing her the F***k off. I hung up on her & called back, got the manager who was still not able to give me a refund for the food that is inedible & she has to talk to the owner. I won't recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever give them my money again."}
{"text":"This is my staple, take out Chinese place.   I have been eating here since way before the ownership change and have enjoyed almost every moment of it.   I typically order one of the same three things every time I get in the mood for Chinese take out:  General Tsao, Chicken and Broccoli, or Triple Delight.    I LOVE their General Tsao, it is spicy but not overly and I think the sauce is the perfect amount of thickness.    I tend to go for noodles instead of rice, but do enjoy their steamed or fried rice.

The girl on the phone knows me (by my phone number) and usually asks me which of my staple three entrees I preferred that night.  That alone adds a brownie point.

The food is prepared quick and steaming hot - I typically let it sit on my counter for 10-15 minutes before even attempting to eat the steaming goodness.

I recommend this place as a quick take out spot if you are in the mood for delicious, fresh and fast Chinese (americanized) food."}
{"text":"Nothing special but OHHH SOOO CHEAPP!!! Also, a tad better than a hole in the wall Chinese places. The food? Pretty good, not stellar but for the price you can't beat it! I always get lo-mein, singapore noodle, or pan fried flat noodle. YUM YUM YUM. If you are uptown and want cheap Chinese food that doesn't taste cheap, this is your go to place. Find another place in Charlotte that you can get cheaper Chinese food and I'd be amazed!"}
{"text":"Very good! Nice service and clean restaurant. Good food as well. Sesame chicken was great!"}
{"text":"This was fantastic food. Had the General chicken extra spicy. It was cooked to perfection. 
Great portions... lots leftover for the next day. Also fast and friendly delivery!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I ordered my usual extra crispy sesame chicken and mushy yuckyness with  bland yet sweet syrupy sauce is what I received. 

I was given no choice between fried rice and white rice and they automatically assumed I wanted the large portion when I actually would have wanted the small if I knew I had the option ( I just thought the prices went up...and truthfully there was no difference in size and it use to be $6.95 now its $10.95!). I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap? 

The usually amazing   crab rangoon wasn't hot enough (temp-wise) and I was totally disappointed.They also forgot to give me my chop sticks which may be a small thing but I specifically asked for them. The literally gave us a full pint of duck sauce though so perhaps they should think of scaling down there and throwing in a veggie egg roll like they use to.  

They use to have 5 stars from me but this last time wasn't even worth a single star in my opinion so  I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give them a 2.5 ...I really am not sure if I would return if the quality has gone that downhill...search is back on for good take-out Americanized Chinese food in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is the best regular ole Chinese delivery I've found. They have all your classic faves and they deliver to a lot of places all around uptown. Prices are good and portions are huge. Why not a 5 star? No yum yum sauce. If they fix this, I'm happy to update my review to a 5!!"}
{"text":"Plus: They deliver.
Plus: The delivery guy is super nice.
Con: The delivery guy has to call me a few times to find my place.
Plus: You can do online orders.
Con: They can't get the online orders right. 
Plus: They have brown rice.
Con: It's hit or miss whether or not they can read the order correctly to get you the brown rice.
Plus: The prices are good.
Con: The food is laden with salt and MSG. I even asked for low salt, low sugar, and low MSG. (See 2nd \"Con\".)
Plus: The delivery guy was super nice when I told him that I had specified the order for later and I wasn't home yet. 
Con: They reheated the same food they'd made earlier for me. Rice and the veggies I got were no problem. But I was also delivered some super soggy crab rangoon. 

Plus: They actually deliver to my place! I live in a mostly dead-zone when it comes to deliveries.
Con: I really don't think I'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Is it the best? No way. Is it the worst? Heck no. I think A-OK is a spot on description of the Cherry House.

Most important thing: you can place orders online. I really hate to order over the phone, so this is a big win for me. They also deliver.

This place is just a few blocks from my house, so it's a super convenient location for me. I usually just grab some take out, but I finally had my first dine in experience Sunday night.

Starving after watching the Denver-Oakland shellacking, we voted on Chinese and decided to head here. I always get soup and one of the combinations. This go round I went Hot & Sour Soup and Sha Cha Shrimp combo with brown rice and an egg roll. Huge portions. My roommate doesn't like this place, but when I brought the leftovers home... she was a big fan. She was shocked when I told her it was from Cherry House. Maybe she's just been ordering wrong? 

My other friend always goes curry when she does Chinese. She ordered the Curry Chicken combination here and didn't like it. I'm not the biggest curry fan, so I'll let her be the judge on that one.

For me, spicy mustard is a must for egg rolls. I got a side and whoa did it pack a punch. I loved it, but it may be too spicy for some so be warned. Soda is by the can, so if you down your drink... you'll have to buy another one. If you're getting take out and do need a soda (one larger than a can), there is a Friendly Mart across the street.

There are better places around, but this hits the spot if you live in the Elizabeth area."}
{"text":"Drunk and need Chinese?  Stumbling out of the P-Stone (Philosopher's Stone) or Jackalope Jacks (JJ's)? HoHo Cherry house is here for you while you wait on a cab.  That said, it is good chinese and the prices are reasonable.  Go for takeout or delivery, the inside is a bit scary and sticky."}
{"text":"Love me some Cherry House on Tuesday nights after work.  Its super cheap, flavorful, and the place is clean.  The people who work there are really nice too.

My favorite dishes are the steamed Dumplings, the Shun Lee Chicken, Vegetable LoMein, Mongolian Beef, and the Hot and Sour Soup.  I hear the Cherry House Chicken is great too."}
{"text":"Convenience has made us frequent customers.  Typically we always do delivery, but we have dined in a handful of times.  The service is good and I have never gotten a dish I didn't like, one of my new favorites is the Cherry Special Chicken.  I may try to order it more on the spicy side next time though.  It is a very sweet dish, but extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"HOHO CHERRY HOUSE, not to be confused with a brothel, offers average food at cheap prices. Fast delivery and friendly staff. No matter what protein you pick it pretty much tastes the same."}
{"text":"Man, I really want this place to be good... but it's not.  A shame - it's so convenient to get delivery (especially when it snowed, hah).  Quintessential Chinese take-out isn't all that great in the first place, but Cherry House's dishes don't even measure up to that standard.

Probably the most annoying thing about the beef, chicken, or shrimp entrees is the abundance of vegetables.  Don't get me wrong - I love my greens, but there just isn't much in the way of protein.  Having ordered a variety of entrees, each of them just go overkill with the veggies.  You feel cheated - the dishes should be along the lines of \"snow peas, carrots, and a sampling of shrimp.\"  And to make matters worse, despite the diversity of dishes available, there's about three flavor profiles available:  (1) salty; (2) sweet; and (3) sweet and salty. 

Hot and Sour Soup - They're doing it wrong.  The viscosity is off, and it's neither hot nor sour, really.  

When my sister visited and tried this place, she said everything from there tastes like broom handle.  I've never had the pleasure of trying broom handle (and I don't know how she would know...) but I take it that it's no filet.

For me, the coup de grace was hair in my food the last two times I ordered!  Supremely unpleasant and tossed it out immediately.  You want to believe it was an accident the first time, but when it happens twice in a row... it's no accident.  Something's busted with the people, product, or process.

dmo out."}
{"text":"I get Chinese maybe twice a year. So unlike most, I don't have a go to spot. The reviews for the two places closest to me weren't so great, so I took yelps advice and we ordered (thru the Eat24 app) from Cherry House. We got steamed dumplings, beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken for the kids and a wonton soup. Ordering was a breeze. Price was nothing to complain about either. Service was friendly. Food was pleasant enough for Chinese. I definitely can't complain. It was all recognizable :) but the dumplings,.,they were delicious, the sauce that accompanies them...to die for. I'm pretty sure we just established our go to place. There was no shortage of condiments. Menu was plentiful and affordable. 4 of us ate off of what we ordered. Not bad."}
{"text":"It's Monday night; I'm hung over, tired, and have been wearing the same two-week disposable contact lenses for so long that the calcium deposits are creating white blind-spots on my periphery. Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Tuesday night; I have a six-pack of PBR in the fridge and four episodes of the CW's break-out hit Arrow to catch up on... Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward cold outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not quite cool enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean socks. So I blow it off and call Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends to hang out around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm \"feeling kind of sick\" or \"I'm really busy\" or \"Really? I didn't get that text\". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful in convincing the women to cook us something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge. But who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

The point is - no matter the day, no matter the situation, the only reasonable answer to your desire for Chinese delivery is Ho Ho Cherry House. 

Sesame chicken. Shrimp fried rice. Egg foo young. Crab Rangoons. Those gnarly little dumpling things. A bucket of General Tso's. A freakin' boat-load of Lo Mein. A lil Mei Fun to keep things crazy. It's ALL GOOD. 

Seriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit this place up. It's very consistently good, the delivery drivers are friendly and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human. 

On those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, and gorge yourself on something cheap, delicious, and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it. 

Let me emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real thing that is happening around us that we can all be a part of. No joke. 

It's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be. 

Very few things in life infuse me with as much pure joy and anticipation as someone uttering the words...

Ho. 
Ho.
Cherry.
Houuuuuuussssseeeeee."}
{"text":"I used them two more times over the next few weeks. I guess I just had some great people on my first experience. Both times I used them again took over an hour to get food and the second time took over an hour and a half. I have to say I was disappointed with the food also. Nothing tasted good these times. Maybe because it got cold in delivery? I saw my earlier five star review and I had to update it with my latest experience."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Charlotte!! and the prices are so good too! nice people great service!! I want to go there now!!! lol"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that the name sounds vaguely like an Asian brothel, we found the place to be a cut above the normal strip mall Chinese take-out joint.  My wife and I had a little time to kill and stumbled upon Ho Ho Cherry House at lunchtime and decided to give it a go.  Table service was pretty good and the staff was all very nice.  The only thing I would say is that I would like it if they paid a little more attention to the timing and waited until we finished the appetizers before bringing the entree.

We had fried dumplings and BBQ spareribs to start.  The dumplings were delicious, plump, tender and flavorful with a dipping sauce that was better than the usual offerings.  Ribs were big and meaty with the normal amount of chewing and tearing required to eat a Chinese restaurant style rib.  Nice char but not enough sauce.

For our entree we shared the Szechuan shrimp and scallops.  It was hot, fresh and flavorful without being overpowering in any way.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, although I suspect that the scallops may not have been real as they seemed too perfectly round and all the exact same size with a strange texture, more like a plug of fish and not very scallop like.  Veggies were all very fresh, texture was perfect and the balance was just right. 

I do have a pet peeve regarding shrimp in a sauced dish such as this - Take the freaking tail off of the shrimp.  It is a hot, sauced, stir-fry and we had to take our fingers and pull the tail off of the shrimp before eating it.  I'm OK if it is a shrimp cocktail or jumbo fried shrimp that you can grab the tail as a \"handle\" and pick it up but, not in a piping hot slippery sauced stir-fry...please...it just makes things messy.

The decor is exactly like any other of this genre and it seemed pretty clean from what we could see. The free wi-fi is a nice touch too.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Updated my review from 2 stars to 1 as they are still incompetent. Don't waste your time, order from elsewhere. I know they are only one of a few places that delivers but use other services such as Postmates or Uber to get better food and service. 

-----

Well the food is pretty good for Charlotte, it is my definite go to place in the area. My issue is with the delivery. I've ordered through the Yelp app and also via phone. Each time it's the same thing. I give detailed directions to press a number on the call box and come up to the right floor/apt and that I don't get cell service on my phone in my place. Each time they call my phone off the hook and I end up having to go down there. 

My other issue is I ask for extra duck sauce each time and each time I get 2 packets. I know it sounds ridiculous but when you order $20 and $30 worth of food the least they can do is throw a few more in there. 

In the end I would say definitely go to the location for a great time but do not order delivery."}
{"text":"The food is \"ok\".  I wouldn't pick this as a favorite \"go to place\".  There is nothing wrong with it, it's just nothing anything special.  Crab rangoons are pretty good.  Service is good, quick.  Clean environment."}
{"text":"No frills Chinese restaurant.  Walking-distance to my house so I get it a bunch.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery and it came an hour and 20 minutes later, cold. I liked that they have low oil choices on their menu. I got the low oil beef and broccoli. It was edible. Worlds smallest eggroll. Horrible Wanton soup. Lo mein was not flavorful at all. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great food here. They are fast and give you a good portion of food. The general tso chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"Their food is average like any other Chinese restaurant, nothing out of the ordinary.  It's all very good.  However, their service is awful.  So awful, I'm only giving them 2 stars.  I live two blocks from here and have never had such a bad experience.  I'm not sure what the cashier's attitude is all about, but buyer beware.  You come here for the food and not the service.  I felt like she was angry we were picking up a to go order and when I asked for extra soy sauce, there was no acknowledgment just an eye roll.  Heads up guys!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food after a good bar crawl but they need to write down orders better.

Had a craving for Chinese food & we couldn't find a menu we received at our door so thank you Yelp for always coming through. Found HoHo which was a bit further away than I expected but over well worth it. The initial phone order went well with the person repeating the order to perfection. Two orders of Chicken wings with Chicken fried rice with no onions which is my go to . I do not like onions of any sort and can't stand the smell so I make it my point to stress no onions.

We get to Ho Ho pick up the order (very nice staff) and drive home. It was past their closing hour by the time I get home & my rice is loaded with white & purple onions. Of course I wanted to call to complain or drive back but distance & time I just let it go.

I would recommend Ho Ho but check your food before you leave. I'll probably try them again if I'm in the area, the wings were good."}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway here for lunch thinking it would be half way decent given the number of people there. Wrong, the food was practically inedible the fried rice flavourless, the chicken meat was an odd texture, the sauce was coyingly sweet. Not sure where I am going to find decent Chinese in this city even Americanized Chinese, but I can definitely say this place is not it!"}
{"text":"food was very good for the price!  your typical Chinese take-out place.  Portion sizes were good.  Would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's the best chinese food that delivers in the area. Your typical american chinese, heavy on the deep fry for classic dishes. Flavor is good."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout, and I've dined in. I'm a huge fan of the oil free options. Delivery is always quick and the order has thus far, always been correct. Dining in, the staff is super friendly.  The food was even better and plentiful.

The pu pu platter was decent. The crab Rangoon, not the best, but far from the worst I've had. The meat stick was tasty. I always love spring rolls. 

My BF got his usual General Tso, and it's better in house bc it's crispier. I got the chicken shrimp house special oil free. It was perfect and the veggies!! Yum!"}
{"text":"The food is always great.  It doesn't matter what you order, everything seems to only take 10 minutes.  I want what ever oven they are using for my own house!!  The dumplings are excellent but the dipping sauce isn't as good as I have had at similar places.  Very nice people and quick service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and you can order through Living Social.  Large menu selection too.  Usually do carry out but it has a dining area too."}
{"text":"Delivery has gone downhill. Waited 1:45 for delivery (less than 2 miles) on a Monday night before the dinner rush. Food was lukewarm at best by the time it arrived. Food is decent for takeout, I like being able to get a dinner combo plate versus the entree portion."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese takeout. They have the absolute best fried rice. It disappoints me that they discontinued making the hot n sour seafood soup the way they had for years. It's now made like the traditional hot n sour soup."}
{"text":"I lived in Houston for nearly 20 years, and ate Chinese food all over that city, whose Asian population is among the most vibrant in the U.S.  Since I moved up here, I've eaten at just about every hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout and \"Asian bistro\" around.  I thought I was past the point of having my doors blown off by a dish, but the Cherry Special Chicken here did it from the first bite.

I ordered it expecting something akin to sweet and sour chicken with a cherry twist.  Sweet and sour isn't my favorite (My young sons, of course, love it) but I had to give this a try.  

What a revelation!  Yes, there's the sweet-tartness of cherry, but there's also a spice kick that put sweat on my brow (I requested it extra-spicy) and a panoply of other spice notes throughout.

Oh, and the hot and sour soup is actually spicy and brilliantly sour.  I order this almost everywhere I go, even though it's usually \"meh\" at best.  I could eat it every day.  

And the sweet and sour chicken my sons got?  Yeah, it was good.  But let's face it, if you can't get THAT right, you'd better close up shop.

The service was very friendly and attentive, and the entrees didn't come out until we'd finished our soup.  

I'm already looking forward to my leftovers for lunch tomorrow ..."}
{"text":"So, everything was good, but not great. As I have stated before, I base Chinese on the wonton soup. And, it wasn't that great. However, the chicken and broccoli and moo shu were both good. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese at a reasonable prices. The food is pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. They are open later on weekends if you're coming home from the neighborhood bars which is a plus."}
{"text":"Food is average Chinese food. What I don't like is they often forget to give you rice. What Chinese restaurant forgets rice in your order on multiple occasions?..."}
{"text":"I don't think there is such a thing as awesome Chinese in Charlotte. I've tried SO many places. There are two types of Chinese places, one you eat in your PJs on your sofa after a long day or really long week and the other where its nice enough to eat at the restaurant. Charlotte has slim pickings of both types. Ho-ho falls into the eat in your PJs, sofa Chinese. I've gotten several different dishes from Ho-Ho since it's fast, cheap and never caused me any heartache.  Heartburn yes, but, what do you expect? Sometimes its better than others, but overall, it always been a solid Chinese take-out option."}
{"text":"I must have gone and dined at the restaurant twice with the food being off. Tonight, I ordered takeout: Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken. This time it delivered on my expectations. Fresh, hot food, with tasty albeit Americanized flavors. Nothing's wrong with Americanized Chinese food, so long as it's tasty and fresh. Sweet, salty, tangy - a little cornstarchy, but not too much. Solid takeout Chinese food place and I will say much better than Panda Express. I recant my previous review."}
{"text":"The vegetables were rotten and they overcharged my order by $15 dollars and then claimed the credit card machine couldn't do refunds.  I won't be returning and I hope others don't either."}
{"text":"Wow, I should have really gone with my gut on this one. Ordered the Kung Pao chicken with a veggie egg roll and the main dish was so bland I had to add hot mustard and duck sauce just to make it palatable. Also, they slumped on the good veggies (red peppers, mushrooms) and just threw in a TON of onions. The veggie egg roll was nothing but mush inside. I honestly feel like getting the frozen stuff from Trader Joe's would have been a big improvement over this. They get 2 Stars instead of 1 because it was ready super fast. 

Save yourself the letdown and go elsewhere."}
