{"text":"tMy friends and I had an awful experience at this bar/lounge last night.  First of all the place was so hot, it felt like an oven.  Everyone in the place was sweating profusely and the waitress was walking around with a wet towel on the back of her neck.  The service was very bad, I guess the waitress was overwhelmed because she was doing the bar and serving, however there weren't a lot of customers.  Not surprisingly because of the unpleasant hot interior temperature.  The cook came out of the kitchen to use the phone, wiped his hands on his dirty apron and went right back into the kitchen, without washing his hands.  This is a real big mistake when you're working in a restaurant.  I ordered the chicken wings which were actually tastey, however because it was so hot I didn't really feel like eating.  No wonder this place is dead, it's kind of dirty, the service is just awful and if they want customers during a heat wave, their a/c has to be working.  My friend was at this restaurant in the winter and she said they didn't have the heat on and the whole place was freezing.  I guess the owner tries to save on his utility bills.  There were a lot of people smoking on the patio and they had the patio door open so the smoke kept drifting into the restaurant.  If you care about your health and well-being, avoid Zemra like the plague!"}

{"text":"Just came back after a perfect dinner.  My wife and I have been on diet for the last 3 weeks and we were starved for good food.  Ordered a large grilled calamari for appetizer - it was superb with olives, garlic and capers.  The complex flavors were fantastic.  We got a 1/2 liter bottle of house wine - it was surprisingly good (granted it our first glass of alcohol for the month).   We ordered the special for the evening a giant 18 oz \"cowboy\" steak (it was rib-eye) for two.  I have to say its the best steak I have eaten for a long long time.  Just melt in your mouth.   It came with super roast potatoes and veggies and a red wine reduction.  I finished about 3/4th of mine, my wife could only finish 1/2 of her portion.  Our son enjoyed the rest at home.   Definitely worth the trip to the west end.  We plan to go back!  This place should be more popular, given the quality of the food and the value.  I have eaten at far too many places which are just not worth the money.  It was surprisingly uncrowded for Saturday with only a few other patrons.   The ambiance was also quite nice - with a dark sophisticated decor."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for a groupon purchase, I may never have stumbled into this place. I have walked by it before but it has always been empty. This scared me a bit - but once I sat down and tried their chicken club sandwich that turned out to be delish all my worries vanished. I am truly at a loss to why Zemra is always so empty.  If this place was on Queen Street West or on College it would be packed every night of the week. It has all the good elements of lounge/restaurant: tasty food, low lighting, affordable prices, and great service. This is the perfect location to bring a date where conversation can flow without loud club music or noisy patrons in the background."}
{"text":"Really, people, 4 or 5 stars? Did you come to a different Zemra?   I have been to this restaurant twice. First time it was OK , although we had to wait for a long, long time to get something very simple. There were not enough people there to justify such long wait for such a price.   OK. I was done with Zemra. But my bf pulled me in another day because there was band playing live music.. Restaurant was empty. Only one couple besides us. We ordered a burger and a dip plate.   30 minutes later, the dip plate has arrived. The band started to pack their instruments. We started asking questions, such as \" Are you hunting for that buffalo?\" and \"How long can it possibly take to BBQ a burger when there is no one else to serve?\"   after a 45-50  minutes of wait my bf announced that he will go home and open a can of sardines. We cancelled the order and left.   We hope Zemra management takes this as a constructive critisism and improves wait times."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and really enjoyed the salad with the goat cheese, and added the chicken, everything was really fresh and the dressing was delicious.   The waitress was accommodating and  friendly when asked to check on the gluten status of anything I ordered.   The food service was a bit slow but the food was worth the wait, except for the dessert which was pretty much tasteless, so save yourself the trouble of ordering the green tea ice cream, sounds interesting but doesn't live up to the intrigue. Nice ambiance, would be a good choice for a date as the lighting is low, and the place is big enough you could find a quiet spot to talk."}
