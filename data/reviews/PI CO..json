{"text":"Craft pizza which means build it on your own here! I love the big selection of ingredients you can put on your pizza. $14 for unlimited toppings with so much to choose from, and they are pretty generous about it too! I picked so much to a point I was like, hey let me know if I am picking too much eh?  People are super nice and chill there and gave me suggestions of what to put on the pizza! Speed, service, food quality, everything in one with an affordable price.  I am coming back! PS - thin crust!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Financial District, this newly opened Pi Co had their grand opening earlier this week. I like to customize my food when that option is available so I decided to craft my own pizza with their unlimited toppings for $14. They had a variety of cheese to choose from such as blue cheese, goat cheese, ricotta, parmesan and fior di latte.   The interior is quite modern with the use of wood and marble and the space is nice and clean. The staff were really friendly and took the time to explain to me which ingredients paired well together based on their flavour profiles. The pizza dough is quite thin so it is best not to overload the toppings. Overall, I love how my pizza is ready in only a few minutes and will be back when I am craving for some fresh and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Simple idea, executed well. Make your own pizza for $14 with unlimited toppings. The selection for toppings is very good. The only thing I'd say was missing is prosciutto.  portions are okay, but because it's unlimited you just have to ask for more toppings if they're not giving you as much as you like. (I asked for more mushrooms 3 times lol). I typically eat half a pizza and can save the other half for another meal. My husband eats one whole pizza and is quite full. The line moves quickly and their pizza oven is crazy awesome. Cooks a pizza in 1.5mins!   Protip: ask for a handful of arugula AFTER the pizza is cooked. (As they're bringing it out of the oven)"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free crust! Was really impressed. While the pizza was delicious, the service was a little scattered. It seemed they didn't have the staff to handle the volume of customers. They did apologize for the delay which was at least nice. The service issue wasn't enough to deter me from returning. They offer so many toppings and the GF crust really was some of the best I've tried ever."}
{"text":"Great fresh fast pizza. The custom made pizza is a great option as you enjoy a pizzaade exactly like you want it. The crust is thin and chewy and toppings very fresh!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really soggy. The dough was burned on the side and uncooked in the middle. Toppings were of low quality too. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for PI day and did not regret it. The pizza dough is quite nice and they have a TON of fresh ingredients to choose from as toppings. The staff are also all really nice people to talk to. I even won a cool free t-shirt in line!   Great pizza! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Tried this location for a lunch on a Tuesday. It was a no-brainer to go with the 'Craft Yours' option. At $14 for unlimited toppings, this could quite possibly be the best 'bang for buck' pizza in town. The toppings to choose from are abundant and fresh. The turnaround time is pretty good, with pizza being the just the way I would like it to be.   Friendly and helpful staff - they don't seem to be seasoned professionals, but, with this right attitude, I'm sure they will get there soon.  I'd give this 4.5 stars; but, more a 4 than a 5. However, I'd definitely rate it above the regular pizza stores (same degree of convenience with better quality)."}
{"text":"Pi day special Craft-yours $3.14 (original $14) The crust is salty, chewy with a little bit crispness."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Pi Co.  It recently opened this location.  You can order a Margherita pizza or \"craft\" your own,  which is what I did.  There are lots of ingredients to choose from ... you can put as little or as much as you want.  It takes 90 seconds to bake.  I got mozzarella cheese, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, pepperoni, bacon, a meatball and sausage on it.  I love love love pizza and this was a delicious pizza.  The ingredients seemed fresh and had a lot of flavour.  I liked the crust ... it was soft and chewy.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are excellent.  You get to create your own pizza with unlimited toppings for $14.  Their pizzas are equivalent to some of the top pizza restaurants in the city but you get it alot quicker and cheaper.  Therefore, if you have a favorite pizza flavour just tell the staff you want those toppings and most likely they will have it.  The staff at the Adelaide and Simcoe location are very friendly.  I hope this does not change.  I live super close and definitely will be back several times this year."}
{"text":"Just opened a new location; though their website says \"coming soon 2018\"  Super clean, nice space,   Friendly staff, everyone is new, a little slow.   I had a side salad. It's actually quite filling.  However, there was way too much dressing. At the bottom there was a pool of dressing. I should have watched them.  Tomorrow, I plan on trying their pizza."}
{"text":"Tried out the new location to give it a chance. Pizza was ok, there are many places I'd rather order from."}
{"text":"This is the third location of the popular Pi Co pizza! Even though prices have gone up a little bit, it's still a very good value to get the \"Craft Yours\" pizza at $14, considering you can get unlimited toppings.  I love this bigger location since seating was an issue at the original Bay/Bloor shop. And like the mid-town location, this one offers beer as well (albeit somewhat limited selection).  Still a big fan!"}
{"text":"Yay for free pizza! They were giving away free Margherita pizzas on their official grand opening day, and the lineup was crazy but fortunately it was not that cold. The pizza was a perfect size and really good even with very minimal toppings, and the staff were very friendly despite having an obviously busy day. Will be back for the create your own pizzas as they have a good selection of toppings."}
{"text":"This review is for an order placed via Ritual app.  Had the \"Craft Yours - Pizza\" which runs $14 with unlimited toppings!   The menu recommends to order 4-5 toppings for best results, and against my desire to load it with everything - I tried it with Regular Dough, 3 Cheeses (Shredded Cheddar, Fior Di Latte, Goat Cheese), Crushed San Marzano Tomatoe Sauce, Bacon, Mushroom, Spinach, Roasted Garlic, Spicy Sopressata.  The 11\" sized pi is a good size for one. It is very thin - so I guess it was wise to follow the recommendation of only 4-5 toppings. Otherwise it'll fall apart because it's so heavy!  The pizza was ready at the time the app reported it to be ready for pick up. Service was nice and friendly.  Also learned that this location as lots of seating! So perhaps dine in next time.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Ok so I may have been here about 10 times already, have a photo on their Instagram page and got numerous amounts of dessert, but that's not what keeps me coming back. It's the premium toppings and the main guy Uri (shout out to Floyd) and their team. Their service is awesome!  Unlimited toppings is the must have, don't forget the pesto and top your pizza off at the end with arugula and chilli oil! The dessert is awesome too, I normally get marshmallows, strawberries and Nutella.   Give it a try!!"}
