{"text":"Sushi was okay at best. Had better. Loved the shrimp tempura for $5. Best part of our dinner"}
{"text":"Love it.  Great Sushi place to pick you your party trays!!!   Always fresh and on time when picking it up after placing an order on-line.  Very convenient as you can place an order on line and pay for it too.   They deliver as well although I always picked up my orders.  The place is in a food court so its not really a good spot for dates or romantic outings but a great place to pick up your food."}
{"text":"Top quality restaurant sushi for a decent price. (It is located in the food court of Sino mall.) Absolutely my favourite sushi place in town! Their Seafood Chow Men is amazing, too."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi places. Friendly staff. Fresh food. Reasonable price. Huge quantity. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"prices are good for the amount of ingredients and topings the chef puts on.  (and would prefer it over the mall sushi booths anyday)   always came i for a quick lunch. Recommend the sushi pizzas  not too keen on their Korean dishes, but love the sushi."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. This is a Korean run sushi store. Today I orders red dragon roll with half 2 butterfish I paid $9 for it tax included and if u didn't know I ordered it at a \"Giotto\" Chinese food court, u will have no clue because it taste better than supermarket sushi dish that would had been a few dollar more.   Rice: good. Not too much and the right consistency Fish: fresh  Service: good. I waited around 5 min  Overall: 9/10 for such cheap yummy sushi!"}
{"text":"Not that good, sushi rice was hard and dry. The colour on the sashimi is not RIGHT. Tempura covered with a thick flour. Also, the takoyaki balls are disaster."}
{"text":"Was by the Mississauga's Chinatown and saw this restaurant in the small food court. Huge fan of sushi burritos and surprised to see that they serve it here. After trying their burrito I notice it wasn't as fresh as others I've tried, each burrito had a Salmon bone piece lodged inside.   I'll give them the fact it was quite large but if your looking for sushi burritos, take the 2 extra minute and drive to Corner by spoon and fork down the road."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out today and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very helpful over the phone and helped me customize two sushi trays for my family. Location threw me off a bit but as soon as I saw the rolls I was confident that we had made a good choice. Luckily we were right! The whole family enjoyed the mix of sashimi and special rolls. I would highly recommend Kaoi Sushi and look forward to trying more of their menu! Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Great deal! We got a delicious platter for a very reasonable price. Our platter was a sashimi/sushi combo. It's definitely a pick-up type of place (the cafeteria the restaurant is in isn't very conducive to hanging around).  The service was pleasant. I would recommend that you find their menu and call and pre-order. We didn't do that, so we had a lot of awkward hanging around a plaza that was closing down. The pieces of fish were large and they tasted fresh. They also gave us plenty of soya sauce and wasabi."}
{"text":"For food court sushi, it's pretty good.  Especially if the owner makes it.  His assistants aren't as good.  He's expanded his menu to include Korean dishes as well.  The food court itself is kind of depressing with two of the restaurants and several shops closed down.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"crazy delicious sushi i have ordered the spider roll and red dragon roll. Both of them are made freshly"}
{"text":"I love Kaoi Sushi. They've been around since the beginning of time. I remember coming to Sino Mall as a child for some good old grub. Only in the later years did we venture out to get Kaoi Sushi - but we've always been impressed.  They are good for catering and regular orders. Their prices are reasonable and the staff are extremely friendly.  And now that the mall itself has gone under a recent renovation, the facilities are definitely more comfortable than ever. So check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi and Korean fare. Like others have said, don't judge a book by it's cover! Much better food than most large Sushi restaurants, the fried octopus is amazing.  It's located in a small Chinese mall you would never even know existed. Awesome, fresh, fast and good value. If you're in the area, a must try"}
{"text":"Loved it! Thanks to the two positive ratings above to take me to this restaurant and keep making me visit every week!  This price cannot be beat with the services and quality of food they offer!  What's even better is they give you 10% discount if you sign up for their membership on-line.  Who would have ever guessed you can find such a good sushi place at a food court?   One of the best I have had in Mississauga, the best I have ever had at this price."}
{"text":"Ordered the sushi and roll party platter, was ready in 1 hour. $47 + tax for 60 pieces of assorted raw fish sushi and special rolls. Taste was pretty good. Medium fresh. Looked clean and neat. The sushi rice on the sushi was  a bit dry and hard though."}
{"text":"Probably by far the worst beef teriyaki bento box ive ever had. All ingredients are from frozen. The shrimp they use is popcorn shrimp from costco, not even shrimp tempura. The springrolls are frozen veggie ones from Costco. The salmon was different colour. Would not return. You pay for what you get"}
{"text":"Kaoi Sushi is located in the food court of the Mississauga Chinese Centre (a.k.a. Sino Mall).  The food court at the Mississauga Chinese Centre is like a much smaller, dirtier and sadder version of the food court at First Markham Place.  It's all independent vendors, no big name chains.     I went here with my parents and we got food from different vendors and then shared.  At Kaoi Sushi (which serves Korean as well as Japanese dishes) we got the pork dumpling, rice cake and noodle soup ($5.99).  The bowl of soup was rather large and it had 2 boiled dumplings in it, lots of Korean rice cakes, and a good portion of thin noodles.  It also had napa cabbage, carrots and zucchini.    The broth was ok, but nothing too remarkable.  Not too salty which is good, but not all that flavourful.  The dumplings were filled with ground pork and onions.  There were a lot of rice cake pieces, so many that they stuck together.  They were chewy and delicious.  The thin noodles were a good consistency, not too mushy.  They have a hot tea dispenser near the cash register and you can help yourself to free hot tea.    For the price, the soup was good, but if I return, I would probably try something else.  They also do catering.  When we were there, I saw them preparing huge sushi platters."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great bubble tea. Great price. I always come here for a la carte sushi and get the sushi special for $10. They have AMAZING pizza sushi! Ask to join their loyalty program."}
{"text":"Great taste and very fresh ! Very friendly staff ! The sushi pizza is a lot for one person at only 7.99. I would try more next time."}
{"text":"Honestly... It used to be better. But if youre craving then its a good cheap spot for something fresh."}
{"text":"Don't ever order their Sashimi or raw fish, had a nasty smell and give me serious stomach issues. The sushi was warm and the smell was just terrible.   Never had issues ordering their cooked stuff, though I would be weary of ordering their raw fish."}
{"text":"This place is in a Asian food court. The prices are crazy low and the food quality is exceptional. This place will not disappoint. The rice is spot on. I had the Spicy Squid with rice and my GF had the maki bento which was in her words \"really really good for the price\". We both will definitely be returning to try more of their very large menu. If you want selection, this is definitely a joint you need to check out. These guys are on the web as well at www.akoisushi.com. CHECK THEM OUT.  One thing, this is definitely not a first date kind of place, as it is in a food court."}
{"text":"Staff are awesome! Makes the food that much more enjoyable.   Top picks: yum yum roll & potato croquettes  (MUST TRY!)"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I usually order from them when we were around the area and the people who run the place are really nice.   The portions are very generous and everything from their menu tastes good (well, if you like korean food in general then every thing will taste good anyway).  I highly recommend this spot in the food court. Just keep in mind that there are odd days that their closed."}
{"text":"Nobody wants to eat ayce sushi? That's okay I'll always go here to fulfill my craving!  I've seen three different owners at this place the first one moved back to korea and the 2nd moved to North York, now there is a young couple running the place and even though the owners have changed the quality of the food is still good.  The place is hidden away at Mississauga Chinatown, inside of the mall. At first glance it looks really sketchy to a point where you don't even want to try it. Don't let it fool you b/c the food is fantastic.   There is a large variety of options considering the place is tiny. You got the usual maki rolls and sashimi and they also serve korean food. Mind you I have yet to try the korean food but give me time and i will.  To me what makes or breaks sushi or maki rolls is the rice, of course theres the freshness of the fish too, but without good rice I will not finish the roll, I'll just eat the filling. As for here you guessed it, the rice is fresh with the right flavour and consistency, it's perfect! One thing that is hit or miss is the sashimi unfortunately. Some days it's fresh other days it's frozen so I would avoid this place in general if you're just looking for sashimi.  No meal is complete without bubble tea and the have it for $3. You have the usual flavours, taro, honey dew and 10 other different flavours to fullfill that bubble tea craving. Come on you know asian food in general is not satisfying unless you have a bubble tea accompanied with it. :-p  If you're having a party and want to bring some sushi they have three options for a party platter. I've ordered one of the platters before and it was the first item gone at the party. :-D. One thing though if you plan on getting a party platter during the weekend you could be waiting up to an hour maybe even longer if you do not call in ahead of time. Last thing, only bring cash, no debit no credit!  Items to definetly get  - when it's cold out the ramen noodles with cali rolls - dynamite roll - double sushi - chirashi donburi (I know I said its hit or miss with the sashimi but I love getting this item from time to time) - party platter"}
{"text":"Please don't judge the restaurant by the cover! It's way better than how it looks like.  I ordered the Korean beef ribs as well as the Crazy Roll sushi. The rice and the ribs were excellent. The ribs were tender and really tasteful. As for the sushi, they were good. But the rice wasn't sticky enough so they were falling apart. Not too much rice, just enough so you can taste the other ingredients.   You can only pay cash which can be an issue for a lot of people but there's an ATM right beside with a 1,75$ charge for it to use.  Overall I'm really satisfied. I got out with a bill of only 16$ for a huge portion. I usually always finish my plate but couldn't this time.   I just can't wait though to find a sushi place as good and as creative as the one we can find in Québec!"}
{"text":"Affordable, friendly and delicious: Kaoi Sushi is pretty much all you could every ask for. I particularly love their Sushi Party Trays as it's great to have at any party!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean/Japanese takeout/cafeteria places. Everything I had here was quite delicious and the guy that makes the sushi is super nice regardless wether you order sushi or from the korean side next to him. I like the fresh fruit bubble tea but some people prefer fake powdered tea over this. It's not the best fresh fruit tea but it's good enough to accompany the delicious food. Did I mention the menu choices are fantastic? Kinda hard to choose every time I go."}
{"text":"Location:  Mississauga \"Chinatown\", at the food court which has been cleaned up recently.  Was formerly quite grungy, but now just semi-grungy.    (Aside:  Anyone in the Chinese community in Miss KNOWS that \"Chinatown\" is a ghost town as T&T, Oceans, B-Trust and other such grocery stores/plazas have popped up!  So I think \"Chinatown\" is sadly a place for the neighbouring buildings and tourists to see the wall, then get back on the tour bus.)  Since I forgot my cell phone, I couldn't take photos, but there are pics of various Korean dishes, sushi rolls surrounding Kaoi's booth.  What sucked was that it lacked description, re:  what's in a Yum Yum, HK, Spicy Dragon Lady, Mavis rolls??  So as a first-timer, it's quite intimidating to be inundated with images, but having no info.  I think I also ordered wrong:  Special Roll Combo.  2 out of the 3 rolls were zigzagged in mayo-based sauces as opposed to having that flavour incorporated into the makis.  I had to scoop most of the sauce out since I was trying to be health-conscious, but what I did eat though was GOOD!  Again, I didn't have any actual fish in my rolls, just shrimp tempura + imitation crab.  I'd definitely try again, even for Korean dishes, and not order rolls with sauce on top!  P.S.  Contrary to what another Yelper mentioned, the prices AREN'T \"crazy low\".  There were pics of various rolls and rolls #1-20 were $7.99each OR $13.99 for 2.  Depending on the size/amount of fish, it's an ok price, but I wouldn't go as far as to say low."}
{"text":"Affordable on the go sushi.. Great for if u need a quick sushi fix. So much variety, and they also take the vincity rewards card ! The food court in which koai sushi is , is being revamped and renovated so it's going to have a new look eventually, which saddens me because it's a childhood memory but I'm still glad that they are renovating for the new modern look with the easier accessibility. This may not be a fancy place to eat, but like I said the food is great, and affordable :)"}
{"text":"Was in the area for a sporting event and looking for a quick bite for after. In search of this place that we could not find initially, my hunger grew. We then discovered its location in the food court area of the mall. The people who operate this joint are very friendly. They seem to have a loyal following. Not sure how the place gets such positive ratings though, as the food is subpar at best. Went on an evening that was very busy so expected quality and got none.  I really should have gone home and prepared a meal. So much for saving time.  What I ordered wasn't anything special to begin with (cali, yam & dynamite rolls) but even the basics were missing. The rolls did not contain fresh ingredients, were falling apart and worst of all, tasted off from the very first bite.  Normally, I get excited to eat sushi. In this case, it was a struggle. I was counting down how many pieces were left cause there were a lot and I didn't want to eat any more. I ended up throwing out more than half the order.  I sat and waited for what I knew was coming next. Not long after, began feeling nauseated. Details omitted as we all know where this is going.. Since I could still taste the aftermath, I washed that down with saltine crackers followed by a decadent slice of chocolate cake and gatorade.  I won't be returning, nor will the person I was with. They wanted to come by after their strict diet was over to indulge and changed their mind as a result of the aforementioned.  We shall stick with original tried and tested sushi restaurants.  Two star rating cause I didn't want to be over the top brutal. Nice people, terrible food. No pictures to show cause the garbage can ate it."}
{"text":"A hidden asian foos gem in mississauga. It looks like a small stand but they cater to diff asian cuisine from Chinese,  to korean, and Japanese.   Foe today's meal me and a friend had the machu pichu roll, yum yum roll, volcano roll, soup, and eggplant with beef brisket on rice.   So In general, food was delicious and portions are big!   The machu pichu roll was yummy but the yum yum roll had a good crunch to it (due to the fried seaweed). The beef in the brisket was so very tender!.   There are a lot of items to try from! If I lived near the area I would pick something new everyday."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday afternoon.  They have a lot of items on the menu which looked sooo good so it was hard to choose at first.  ordered: 1) porkchop with rice (6.99)     -tasted a bit bland.  2) takoyaki ($5.99 for 8pcs)     -REALLY GOOD & worth it  3) sushi pizza (7.99)      -the BEST OF THEM ALL!!!! Huge! Probably a good for two sushi! It has salmon, avocado, crabmeat, crunchy bits, topped with mayo and special sauce.  4) durian bubble tea (4.50) with tapioca      -meh. tasted like medicine syrup...  But overall, the staffs were REALLY REALLY friendly & nice. Has extensive items on menu. Plus, the sushi pizza & takoyaki were so worth the price!! Will come back for it."}
{"text":"A great spot for quick sushi meal at an affordable price. Super great selection of foods and cuisines (Japanese/Korean/Chinese). There are many different combos to choose from. It is a hidden g. Definitely need to check it out if you're in the area for grocery shopping and hungry."}
{"text":"Found this little food place in Mississauga Chinatown.  We trying the kimchi fried rice,  beef brisket and salmon rolls.  The salmon and brisket it was fine but the kimchi fried rice is to oily and need more taste. So many choices food and I think I should give try the second time."}
