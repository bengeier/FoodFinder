{"text":"Visited Alle Darsene in July of '14 - it was recommended by the staff at Hotel Belvedere and for good reason! Our dinner was fantastic and the service was impeccable. The restaurant was filled with a mix of international visitors and Italians - great energy but not too crazy.  Will definitely return on our next trip to Como!"}
{"text":"Wir haben hier hervoragend gegessen und und sehr wohl gefühlt. Auf Sonderwünsche ging das sehr freundliche und aufmerksame Personal beinah liebevoll ein. Auf der Terrase unter den Platanen am Hafen sitzt man im Sommer sehr sehr schön. Innen waren wir nicht."}
{"text":"This was our first restaurant during our 2 week vacation to Italy. The food, the wine, the service, the atmosphere, the staff, the presentation were all terrific. We were greeted and treated like family. The staff was attentive without hovering. We arrived by cab and once we had finished our dining experience, management had already contacted the taxi to return us to the hotel. 

We were welcomed with complementary glasses of Prosecco. We have been searching the web to find the recipe for courgette (squash) blossoms filled with ewe's ricotta as they were prepared at Alle Darsene because they were the best we had anywhere in Italy. The wines were perfectly paired with each course.

There are plenty of fine dining places in Bellagio, but this one is a must."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant just beyond Giardini de villa Melzi in bellagio.  We dined under a vine covered pergola and enjoyed terrific food. Howard had the tasting menu with an asparagus salad with burata, red shrimp and egg yoke, then black and white gnocchi with muscles and clams, then pork tenderloin with homemade BBQ sauce. Dessert was an apple cake with gelato a bit of crumble and berries. Yum!  Beth had zucchini flowers stuffed with sheep ricotta and then lake fish and veggies fried in olive oil. While it was fried, it was delicate and light. Delicious.  Best of all was the service ... Welcoming, friendly And efficient!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this off the beaten path! We were led here by the NYT guide to Lake Como and were treated like royalty. The staff is amazing and I enjoyed the pasta with lake fish especially"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had! Just at the behind door of the Villa and free parking. Need try the beef tartar, I had veal, it's so perfect"}
{"text":"One of the top 10 lunches of all time!  Set in a tiny village about a 20 minute walk from Bellagio. You can dine outside with a view of the lake, mountains and fisherman. Food + service + location = 100% satisfaction."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food served at this restaurant a little out of town. The service is good. And most important, so is the food. The sword Fah pasta was excellent. We tried the pigeon and the Spanish pork. Both were very good. And finish off with the crepe."}
{"text":"We were recommended to try this place from a local. If weather permits, sit outside and enjoy the fresh air and lake.

I had the cheese platter, which is meant for dessert, as an appetizer. Great assortment of local cheeses from sort to hard accompanied by house made jams. 

The ravioli was a must have as well. Fresh pasta stuffed with delicately seasoned veal with a cream and truffle sauce. Could have ordered 4 servings of this and called it a day. 

We tried the lake fish appetizer but truthfully it's an acquired taste. Lake Como fish has a distinct flavour- one that is too strong for my liking. 

The roasted lamb main was beautifully done paired well with a chianti. For dessert, I opted for a cannoli which was made of fresh ricotta served with glazed strawberries and a scoop of chocolate gelato.

Service was amazing and prompt. Very helpful staff particularly around picking appropriate wines for each course."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner at Alle Darsene. We ate outdoors with a view of the water. There were mostly tourists with a smattering of locals. The waiters were young and very pleasant. We were served a free glass of prosecco, which was nice. The appetizers were great. There was a special of pasta with white truffles that was off the chart. The zucchini flowers were also excellent. Main dishes were not quite as excellent. The fried fish and vegetables were well prepared and light. The ravioli was OK. Two of our party had a bit of trouble finding an entree. 

Overall, a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant.  No one in our group liked their dish. I had the zucchini flower stuffed with ricotta cheese and the cheese was dense and not gooey as you'd expect. I also had the lake fish fried in oil and it was terrible. The batter was NOT tempura, it was soggy from the oil and tasteless. A sauce of some sort would have helped! The waiter we had was awesome, however and the setting was beautiful. It is very close to Bellagio, but I wouldn't  recommend walking back to town in the dark on the curvy road with crazy Italian drivers."}
{"text":"The best meal we had on the lake. By far. The food was fabulous. Go for the tasting menu. Come here after visiting Villa Melzi, just outside the back entrance.

Tasting menu is only like 50 euros for 4 courses, which is a bargain on the lake, for the quality of food you get. If you're not getting the tasting menu, you have to get the beef tartar with truffles for the starter. Absolute heaven."}
{"text":"Situated not in central Bellagio, so a bit of walking is required through the Botanical Garden by the Melzi family (need to pay). The garden is quite nice though. Since it's not in the center of the town, it feels quite exclusive and private. The food is quite fine. For lunch, we ordered the swordfish salad with chicory, chestnut soup shrimp wrapped in bacon, and fried lake fish. All dishes are good and unique. A nice restaurant to visit if you don't mind a bit of walking."}
{"text":"Dining in Lake Como can be a bit of a challenge but a few locals had recommended this as one of the better restaurants on the lake.

We had rented a boat for the day and there is a small area where you can dock your boat during lunch. I do not recommend driving a boat here unless you are an experienced captain. It's a tight waterway and there is very little space.

Once we managed to tie up the boat (which resulted in one minor bump into another boat and many, many laughs), we headed up to their terrace. Service was lovely and we sat in a garden over looking the waterway and the boats. 

We started with the stuffed zucchini flower and then tried pasta with burrata and lake fish. The pasta was very fishy and not for us. It tasted like it was loaded with anchovies. We told them our thoughts and they were happy to bring over a spinach ravioli to replace the it. It was better than the fishy pasta but nothing remarkable.    

We had the fried lake fish as the main and it was fried in a tempura batter. Very light and nice.

An A-Ok meal just a 15 minute walk from Bellagio."}
{"text":"This restaurant is Fantastic!!!!!!! Very fresh seafood. The staff were friendly and helpful for us tourists. Make the walk from the ferry it is worth it."}
{"text":"This is a solid classic Italian restaurant with outdoor dining in good weather and indoor dining, away from the tourist hordes of the Bellagio promenade. 

The service is good the italian food is solid the prices are reasonable and it is very popular and has a good energy to the restaurant. In particular, the cheese plate is fantastic and the great value and the wine list has several good options under 60. 

One story that is particularly worth noting about the good service: I forgot my wallet with credit cards and had no cash on me and didn't realize it until the bill came.  After a few stressful moments and a call to my hotel to validate I was at least who I said I was they were extremely understanding and let me come back the next day to pay.  

One hint, don't drive a large car - the one-way road leading to the restaurant is very narrow."}
{"text":"Le chef fait une cuisine italienne inventive et raffinée. C'est bon et original!

Nous avons mangé à l'intérieur car le jardin au bord du petit port était complet. Cadre chaud dans les tons de rouge orange et jaune et service soigné.

Excellent repas avec pour commencer antiparti: la variation de poissons du lac et des fleurs de courgette à la ricotta, puis en primo piatto partagé la zupetta di cavetelli et ensuite en secondi piatti : la friture du lac et une queue de veau milanaise.

Le tout avec un excellent blanc Ca' Brione 2012!

Café pour finir car nous avions très bien mangé.

Vraiment de très grande classe. Bravo au chef!

Un conseil : réservez avant surtout si vous voulez être au bord du petit port..."}
