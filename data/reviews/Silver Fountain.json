{"text":"Wanted to try something different at this food court and unfortunately made a bad decision. The prices were cheaper than the other big rival store which convinced me to try, however you get what you pay for! The quality of food served here was terrible. 

Ordered a brisket ho fun noodle soup and honestly it was not edible and had to throw it out. The beef brisket was hard and not ready, not to mention it only came with 3 small pcs.. overall was tasteless. Also ordered a fried rice noodle and it was also tasteless, the ingredients were not fresh for both orders, and sidenote, drinks came in a small foam cup instead of proper take out cups. 

All in all, terrible experience and will not return. I'd much rather pay $1-2 more for quality food and larger portions at the big store."}
{"text":"More 2.5  was in the area and looking for a quick bite.  Hk garden was closed so went into food court and stumble onto this.   For 6.00 the quantity was a little anemic.  The few peices of beef were ok, not rock your socks off great.   The noodles were off. Seemed to have started the fermentation process early.   Had the beef and drink (it's ok again)."}

i've been coming here for years...  friendly lady has practically watch me grow up.  

its not too bad, its a cheap place for quick chinese food.   their iced lemon tea is good and quite cheap when you purchase food.   If you want to try a new dish they maybe able to accommodate it if you ask since its a highly competitive foodcourt.

i have to be honest with you though... i have found cockroach in my food here before.. a baby one if that helps..

i'll still return because its dirt cheap and im broke."}
