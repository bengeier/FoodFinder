{"text":"A favourite frozen yogurt place for my family. Good selection of flavours and doesn't taste too artificial nor too sweet. Also a decent selection of fresh fruits and toppings. Menchies is closer to where we live but we rather drive to Yozens for something much better."}
{"text":"We were excited to try yozens as it's in our neighbourhood, unfortunately we had an unusual and unpleasant experience when the staff insisted that they had to fill every single sample cup for us (none of the other froyo places around here or anywhere has ever suggested such a thing)  I told them I didn't need to sample that I was fine just choosing flavours that I liked but they insisted and proceeded to have to ask me at every flavour if I wanted to try, then fill the cup, hand it to me...etc.  Totally ridiculous!   The worst part is that they would not even accept any constructive criticism on their facebook page and ignored all \"negative\" comments about their establishment and then proceeded to delete them and leave only the peachy comments on their page.    With so many other froyo places in the area I choose to just avoid Yozens all together after that."}
{"text":"Yozens offers a great number of flavours of frozen yogurt as well as a banquet of toppings, sprinkles and sauces to add to your frozen concoction.   The owner/operator is quite friendly and on my visit, offered samples of the flavours.  I quite liked the Vanilla (where I'm usually a chocolate girl) and the tangy Greek yogurt was my favourite. They offer a number of fruit flavored (the mango was really good) and some blends, like Mojito.  You pay by weight once you've put it together.  It's a clean and bright, newly-built store in an unfinished plaza (paved). Parking is free."}
{"text":"I use to love this place. I actually went and told all my friends about it and how great to have a frozen yogurt place is Ajax. However, my last experience will never bring me back again. The owner/operator was quite friend when the store first opened, but now is lacking some customer service.  I brought in a coupon that I received in the mail (buy one get one free and buy one get 50% off). We came in with 4 people and wanted to use 2 coupons (I was hoping that made sense). The owner advise that we only can use one coupon per visit, and if we buy 4 we can only get one free (with the buy one get one free coupon). We tried to tell him that we are paying separately, but the owner refuse to let this happen. I know that this was something small, but it left a sour taste for me towards the business. I know that they just lost 4 customers that will never ever go there again. Hope they Yozens see this post and change the way they do business for a better experience for their customers!"}
