{"text":"I liked it a lot. It actually really impressed me with taste I can't believe such a negative opinion. Maybe ppl had off day it's a rib place it's a good place."}
{"text":"Have not experienced the food at the Rib Crib however have had a meal charged to my visa from this location.
Upon further investigation found out that i made the purchase at the leslie St Wild Wing Newmarket ( same owner ??????? Different town) be aware of your purchases,Do not know how your meal charges will show up and can cause issues with your credit company when you do not know what a charge is.

{"text":"Ok, I went to \"Rib Crib\" for lunch today (was working from home and I live in Aurora). Bottom line: It's absolutely horrible.

First of all, it's the same guy behind the \"Pink Burger\" concept. Apparently I heard he owns the Wild Wing franchise as well. 

I tried ordering the pulled pork, but was told \"we are out of pork\". Huh? It's 3/4 of your menu!.. \"We are getting a delivery today, but it has to thaw anyway...\" Frozen... lovely.. not suprised.

So, I ordered the brisket sandwich ($5.99) that doesn't come with ANYTHING. You have the option of ordering beans or slaw extra for $1.99. WTF? what BBQ place doesn't include anything on the side? They were out of slaw as well (at this point I was laughing). So i got the beans. My wife ordered the same sandwich (no side for her), and we shared an order of the fried pickles ($4.99) as an app.

The pickles came. Or.. I should say pickle (sing.). It was literally one pickle cut in quarters length wise... for 5 frickin bux... they tasted ok, wife hated them.

The sandwiches came. This isn't brisket. It's pulled like pulled pork... WTF? Not only that it is DROWNED in sauce. In fact, it might as well been pork, as you wouldn't be able to taste the difference. Size isn't very big, which would be forgiveable if it tasted good... But it didn't. It was horrible: Like eating a bun with sauce and no beef flavour. no smoke, no nothing. Garbage. The beans were even worse. basically Heinz out of a can thrown into a little plastic cup for $1.99 extra.

The bill came to $25. I gave the waitress a $5 tip because she was nice. So $30 for 2 sandwiches, 1 pop (wife had water), fried pickle, and side beans. complete and utter ripoff. Oh, the indigestion was free :)

Honestly, if you're in the area, drive a little farther north to Big Bone BBQ on Eagle st, as they serve up the real deal (same owners as Memphis in Vaughan). Even driving to Southern Rub in Vaughan, or The Stockyards on St. Clair W. is worth spending the gas money over this crap. At least those folks serve up authentic BBQ, and they are passionate about the food, rather than the \"gimmick\"

To the other guy who accused me of joining a day before the review:  You are correct, I did.  Long time user, just never signed up.  I assure you I have no affiliation  whatsoever with any of the above mentioned restaurants.  I am just a long time Aurora resident who appreciates authentic BBQ, as I do it at home often on my own Big Green Egg.  You however, seem offended that I found the experience horrible.  This means you either:
1. Really liked the place, to which would invite you to expand on the review,  Perhaps it was just an off day that they happen to run out of pork.  How was your experience?
2.  Are indeed affiliated with Rib Crib in some way, to which As a paying customer, and Aurora resident, I would love to give my honest feedback in person in hopes of your improvement.  My motive?  Simple..  I love to see local businesses succeed, and I love BBQ...

Regards,
