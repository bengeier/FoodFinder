{"text":"I discovered Nikki's years ago when I worked at the Post Office on Wabash.  This little \"place in the neighborhood\" was my daily go to!  I have since moved to Arizona, but one of my first \"home\" food stops is Nikki's for the Cheesesteak!!  Oh my gosh... better than Crack!!  I get mine with mushrooms and onions which are cooked in with the meat, Provolone melted on top with lettuce / tomato/ mayo.  Of course, they will customize it for you any way you like!"}
{"text":"Yum!! We just tried this place for something new and it was great! I was glad to find that this place has it's own unique style and it didn't disappoint.

As recommended by another reviewer, we got a white pizza with feta and it was scrumptious. Garlicky, flavorful and creamy. I also LOVED that the crust was kind of par-baked and doughy. Give me more crust!

When we ordered, we didn't have cash (no online ordering, the only minor let down), but the guy on the phone said we could pay by card when it was delivered. We did, but the sweet delivery man left too quickly before we could tip! We will be ordering again and tipping extra!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and gyros at very reasonable prices. I would highly recommend if you're looking for something simple and good!"}
{"text":"Niki's is pretty decent. 

The place needs a overhaul. It's looking a little dated inside. 

The two guys working there were pretty friendly and the food was OK. The place is pretty conveniently located in the west end near some cool piano shops and not too far away from a park with a basketball court and some tennis courts."}
{"text":"This pizza is good, but not what I'm used to. If you're looking for a crispier crust this would not be the place for you. I haven't tried the hoagies and other menu items. I might come back and try the hoagies and update my review. Everyone has different tastes!!! I think that the pizza could have been cooked a tad bit longer. It was just a little bit doughy for me."}
{"text":"Not many pizza places left in this area but this one has managed to survive many eras. I've had it a few times and it's OK. Nothing special but not terrible. Parking has become atrocious on the block in front of the place."}
{"text":"Now this is some good pizza. Why there are no reviews is completely beyond me. Eh, I'll earn another first to review badge. 

I give my brother props for finding this place, he is the pizza delivery King. On a recent delivery I ordered a small white pizza, my all time favorite item from Nikki's. Lots of garlic olive oil, ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, feta and I guild the Lilly and add black olives. This is a flavorful pie. And semi healthy, one slice fills me up and I can make 2 or three meals from on pie. 

Their regular pies are also works of art. They do Sicilian style as well as Neapolitan. The square pizza is my least favorite, and let's face it, if you want square pizza, Beto's is the best in the Burgh and cannot possibly be bested. The traditional round pizza American's all know and love is fabulous. Thick, chewy crust, a sweet/tart/semi spicy sauce and tons of cheese that to me tastes like a blend of mozzarella, Provolone and brick(?)or muenster(?). Excellent flavors all melding together to make the perfect pizza. They have all the normal toppings, but I find it to be really good with earthy mushrooms and a salty umami blast from black olives. 

The next morning I'll take a slice and put it in the oven and get the crust nice and crunchy and toss some soy sausage on it for a good breakfast pizza. 

Obviously they deliver and depending on your location it gets there faster if you're close to the west end. I believe you can dine in, but don't quote me on that. It's always piping hot when it's at my door. Great delivery guys too, always friendly. I still can't believe I'm getting a First to Review badge. This pizza rocks!"}
{"text":"Cool little pizza shop run by some Greek fella's I believe . Don't let the looks of the place fool you, their pizza is very good as well as their hoagies and other items . I eat here atleast once a week for lunch . It's right by my school , thumbs up!"}
