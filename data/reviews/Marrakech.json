{"text":"Great ambiance with good food. The staff was attentive and professional. The accommodated a group of 14 with ease and a peanut allergy. We almost double tipped them but the staff was so professional , they pointed out our error and enabled us to reimburse the family member who covered the bill. We would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here 6 times now. Come whenever I'm in Vegas. Food is excellent. The belly dancers are fun and music thumping. The steak skewers are tremendous - perfectly seasoned. I'm a life-long customer."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a guest, and while the service was great, the food wasn't as awesome as I would have hoped. The portion sizes were great. I just felt that the main dish (chicken and couscous) were not as flavorful as I would have hoped. 

Also, the dancers were only out about half of the time we were there. It would have been nice if there was entertainment the whole time."}
{"text":"The only reason I didnt give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because of the service.
Servers were not very friendly and were slightly rude. We actually noticed them looking at the customers and sort of making fun of people. That  was a big turn off for all of us. It seemed as they didnt want to spend too much time with customers, they were more interested in watching the belly dance performance :-)

The atmosphere and music are great, belly dancers are beautiful and very good performers. 
They serve a 6 course meal, which I really enjoyed. My favorite was definitely desert: chocolate, cinnamon and pastry.. it was heavenly.

Overall tasty food and fun atmosphere, but servers ruined what couldve been a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't the let strip mall exterior fool you! Also the single room when you walk in was fully decorated in authentic lighting and fabrics (tented). We were a group of 11- a bachelorette group and we were ready for an experience!

The staff was very attentive and the belly dancers were talented. Each performance they roamed the room, pulling up diners from each table to dance. Perfect for celebrating a birthday or special occasion. 

The food however delicious was A LOT!!!! At the third course we were done for. The last course, dessert...... WORTH THE WAIT!"}
{"text":"Service d zebbi! If you are Moroccan, don't go there, because they'll treat you like crap. I had the feeling they don't like Moroccans because they would criticize the non sense they serving, but at least for the price people deserve a decent service and no attitude form the servers. If you are not Moroccan, maybe you don't know any better, because it's far from Moroccan authenticity. I wish vegas has a better a Moroccan place to try."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place! However be ready to eat! U get a pre course meal and it's absolutely amazing... starting with shrimp scampi, then soup, then dips, then kabobs, then chicken and cous coups and when u thought u we're done they bring out a delicious mini cake with hot tea. Needless to say this place will leave u full and full of authentic Moroccan spirit. If ur ever in Vegas and don't wanna go to the usual overrated spots, come here! U won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.   The menu was preset and the food was very flavorful and very home made tasting.   The belly dancer was very good and the service was excellent.   I think with the preset menu you may lose some of the ethnicity of the food as it must appeal to everyone.   Overall very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our dining experience here. The belly dancers were very good.  Overall the food was pretty good. The shrimp was overcooked but the kabob's were excellent.  We liked the moroccan wine also.  We came for the overall experience and did not have super high expectations on the food anyway."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior... Once you get inside you'll feel like you're in Morocco! Service was a little slow at the beginning but once your 6 course meal starts it moves swiftly along! Great food and good atmosphere! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and cultural experience. Fixed menu limits the frequency of visits, but definitely a place to take out-of-town guests to show them something a little different. I would fully recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"A little out of my price range but between the belly dancer and great food it's well worth my money ! Very calm relaxing vibe with a authentic twist you can't find in Vegas any more !"}
{"text":"When we drove up were weren't quite sure what to expect as the restaurant is situated in a small unassuming strip mall.  Once we walked inside any hesitations we had were whisked away.  The decor is great, the food absolutely delicious and the dancing very entertaining.  The best evening meal we had while in Vegas!  

If you looking for something unique and away from the casinos this is the place!"}
{"text":"Oh boy... what can I say? It's simple, words cannot describe how delicious the food from this place is. It is one of the two places I have ever gone to that from start (appetizers) to finish (dessert) everything was great. I loved the atmosphere, made you feel like you were in a whole other world. The customer service was excellent. I thought it was a nice touch when they come to your table with rose water and you clean your hands before you eat. 

What was the menu? 
Lentil Soup 
bread 
hummus/veggie platter 
beef kabob 
chicken with Moroccan spices 
and a banana dessert"}
{"text":"Not for me.  I was here for a large birthday party and did not enjoy the food.  The atmosphere is fun as it is unusual and the belly dancers create a unique experience.  Have not been back to dine again."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like this place is anything special from the outside, linked in with random stores in a tiny strip mall, but it will surprise you from the second you walk in. 

The decor is authentic and unique. You seem transported to what feels like a cool, Moroccan palace. Since the menu is already planned in courses (prix fixe)- sit back and enjoy the experience. 

It begins with hand washing in what smells of soft, fragrant roses and ends with a dessert that is everything your sweet and savory tooth desires. The courses of food are so good and the cocktails are too! A warm mint tea soothes after the large meal. Having a prix fixe menu allows the diner to really relax and allow the restaurant to take them on a tasteful journey. 

This place is a Las Vegas experience and guests always love it when we take them here. But it's also fun for locals too. Be ready to dine for a few hours  and come with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. From the ambiance to the service, from the food to dancing - it truly has it all. I recommend both locals and tourist make this a \"must-see.\" You wont be disappointed. 
After washing your hands in warm rose water, prepare to dive into a five course meal that will tantalize your senses. And if you have a chance in between bites, make sure you take notice of the beautiful belly dancers that perform throughout the night. You may even find yourself performing right along with them! 
Its truly a great time for the whole family. I am SO glad I found this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered the hummus and a falafel side through uber eats. It was THE BEST FALAFEL I HAVE EVER HAD! super light, crispy, and served with a hearty side of perfect hummus and semi-pickled veggies. My order came with a whole loaf of traditional  challah bread, PERFECT pita chips, and fresh-baked pita bread. I am very impressed with the taste, presentation, price/value and prompt preparation. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Never had Moroccan food before. Walking in I was scared...I'm not an adventurous foodie nor am I keen on trying new cuisine. I'm definitely a creature of habit. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!  

Menu is quite simple: 6  course price fixe menu. Shrimp scampi appetizer, \"cinnamon - tomato soup\" (my description, I don't know if it was actual tomato soup), hummus, beef skewers, chicken & couscous, and a chocolate banana pastry with powdered sugar (that can be made with peaches or pear) served with a hot tea.  

I loved that the only utensil available...were your fingers (until the chicken dish & desert).

The flavors were wonderful. Not too little, not too much. Just right. The soup had a cinnamon taste to it which I found delightful & surprising. The skewers presentation was fun: delivered a la pineapple. I really enjoyed these two courses and filled up on these and the shrimp scampi. I really needed to be rolled out of the restaurant...I ate way to much. Unfortunately, I did not care for the hummus. (Did I spell that correctly?)

The place is small & dark inside. Seating very comfortable; it was dining on the sofa in your living room. 1 belly dancer performed at a time.  I loved the entire experience. Already looking for an excuse to go back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food ever. All of it was fabulous! The dessert was out of this world! Great belly dancers. Very talented. Next time in Vegas, we are going back for sure! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the entertainment is great, & the staff is so accommodating and nice!  The owner Tariq always makes me and my guests feel welcome whenever we come here.  This will be my second birthday that I'm celebrating here, and all I can say is - if you want to have an amazing time, come to Marrakech! You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Marrakech was an oasis of wonderful food and atmosphere on our recent trip to Vegas.  The decor is stunning and the shaabi/rai music was manna to my abused ears (seriously, did they stop importing music into Vegas in the early 90s?  so much bad music everywhere we went!).  The food was by far the best we had during our trip; you can tell the difference between chefs who make food because they care about food and chefs who design dishes to please the masses, and the chefs at Marrakech are definitely the former.  We were stuffed by the kabobs, but made a valiant effort to eat what we could of the couscous and the sweet bistilla served for dessert.

And of course there was the belly dancing--house dancer Aradia put on an excellent show, full of energy even though the restaurant was not that busy on a Tuesday evening.  I'm a dancer myself and I can say with authority that she is very good, a national class dancer and a great entertainer.

In short, Marrakech is the real deal and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went to Marrakech this evening with some friends.  Arrived on the early side, around 6:30p.   Ambiance was fun--1001 Arabian nights stuff.  Food was middle of the road--not bad--just not particularly unique or flavorful.  Service was very attentive/good.  The belly dancer provided some decent  entertainment, although it was a little weird watching a 5 year old boy tucking dollar bills in belly dancer's skirt at his parents' insistence.  Actually, perhaps it was a sort of training ritual               to prepare hims for his future trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Love how there are No menu ..set course Meal...Food Is Great .. Belly Dancers for entertainment. Great for First Date...:) 

Love the ambiance, BUT
Many Many years ago, they had Pillows all Around to sit on or lay back and was very Cozy & Very relax,   but now they have mini chair ; dont like  ..:( 

Over all Great Place!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant on two of our Vegas trips.  It is a very short drive from the strip and well worth it.  The Moroccan experience at Marrakech is just as good as the food.  The belly dancer was awesome.  She encouraged my wife to get up and shake her booty.

The food is awesome as well.  I like not having to worrying about ordering they just keep bringing the food.  The service is top notch, glass of water always full, never have to ask for more bread and the next course comes just as you wash down the prior course with your beverage.

The place isn't cheap and I got the impression that the menu doesn't change much so I'm not sure if this is a good place to go to more than once a month.  The groups we saw there were having an AWESOME time.  Lots of locals here, this is a good place to go if you want to get off the strip.

There isn't any good Moroccan in San Diego so when SoCal residents drive to Vegas, dine at a place off the strip once and enjoy the entire experience of dinning at a Moroccan Restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great.  No menus, $60 a person, Belly Dancers, Authentic Atmosphere... doesn't even feel like your still in Vegas.  The food which was 6 courses melted in my mouth.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but as much as I loved the steak, I HAVE to find out what sauce the fruit was smothered in.  Its not even right.  I literally was full after the 4th course and couldn't stop eating because itw as so good.  We went with a big group, but I would def take a girl there that enjoys good culture.  Maybe not the high-maintence bottle-service only type."}
{"text":"We loved the place.  The location is in a strip mall and so you're not sure what it's going to be like.  Parking lot was full so we parked in the back lot.  It's surprisingly close to the strip.  

The food was soooo good.  the Lentil soup was amazing.  It was seasoned so well.  The hummus was just ok but having the fresh cucumber and carrots with it was nice (vs. pita bread).  The shrimp dish was my favorite.  Absolutely delicious.  I could have eaten that all night.  Then the final course, the chicken w/ the couscous was good but shrimp was better.  Ask for the hot sauce.  It's soooo good.  

I had a bite of the dessert which was good and the tea they give you is even better.  I'm normally not a fan of tea but it was really yummy.

For the price of the food and the entertainment and the vibe, I thought it was a wonderful experience.  It's something different from all the fancy steak houses on the strip.  We loved it and I would totally go back."}
{"text":"What a class act!!!  Took a big family group to dinner in March.  The food was great.  Big portions, and good value. The dancers are very talented, and made the nephews in our group blush.  

My bad:  when I got home, I found that I had double tipped them, as I didn't notice (in the dark room) that the gratuity was included in the bill.  I was lazy, and did nothing to follow up with the restaurant.  Just got my visa bill.  They took the double tip off without even being asked.  Wow.  NEVER had that happen before."}
{"text":"Every food course was amazing, especially the chicken.  Their belly dancer was outstanding and the service was wonderful.  Be sure to pace yourself for all six courses.  The portions are very generous.  Have fun and enjoy the authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had heard of Marrakech and been wanting to go there for about a year already. My Birthday finally came around and i thought what better way to celebrate it then at Marrakech!!! Oh how wrong i was!

 the food was bland and really nothing exciting might of even tasted like something thrown together in 15 min. My  waiter made it an even worst experience ever. Making some racial Comments is so uncalled for and how very unprofessional. He was a more heavy set guy who is Cuban i believe. 

The food was being rushed.  the shrimp scampi was removed from my table when i had literally put the last shrimp in my mouth then i sipped my lentil soup when the Zalook and Hummus appeared. i dipped in maybe twice when the kabbobs and cous cous was already there and my humus was gone...before i new it everything was wrapped in a box to go all i needed was for someone to tell me ,DONT LET THE DOOR HIT YOUR BUT !!

 I will never go here again. One time for me is all it takes. It seems like it has great reviews from many pple but from what i see this place does have a problem with the customer service part. Tip to Waiter Keep the racial comments to your self Buddy. I will be telling all my friends about this place and what bad experience i had . i give Marrakech A BIG THUMBS DOWN!!!!"}
{"text":"You walk in, it's very dark, the waiter leads you to a table that is the height of your knees. You literally have to hunch over to eat and who wants to eat some nasty stew with BONES in it in the dark?? Just gross! The lady dances for way too long, you feel like you have to give her all of your attention. It's a dirty overpriced uncomfortable place to eat. Needless to say, I don't suggest it."}
{"text":"Growing up in a moroccan household, this restaurant makes me feel like im visiting my family. Everything from the food to the atmosphere is simply amazing. This restaurant NEVER disappoints! Dont think twice - you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Marrakech is THE ultimate date spot, great for a gathering of friends you haven't seen in awhile, or simply a spectacular experience! I have been going here for years and have enjoyed excellent food and fantastic service every time. 

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and I love the low tables and cushion-like seating. The servers are all warm and timely in refilling wine and water while juggling all the courses of delish food and the belly dancers are always wonderful too! Bring some cash to tip the dancer and be prepared for her to teach you a move or two!

The food is absolutely amazing and you cannot beat the price anywhere in town! Course after course is beautifully presented to the table and everything tastes amazing! I cannot pick a favorite course so make sure that you arrive with a big appetite. 

Overall this place is a gem that I tell friends, family, and tourists alike that they MUST go!!!"}
{"text":"My family and friends went in to celebrate a birthday. We had such an amazing time! The food was absolutely delicious. The service was spot on. To top
It off the belly dancers got my daughter up to dance with them. We had such a great time! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So happy we came across this place during the AILA convention. The environment, food, and service is beyond excellent. You need to try the shrimp dish. Definitely coming back for the party they have on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Angel:  4 Stars: Very intimate and sensual atmosphere. We were greeted by a typical male Las Vegas nightclub host; seeing that we were dining at a venue that promotes itself as an authentic Moroccan restaurant, I found him to be quite out of place. Upon entering Marrakech we found ourselves submerged into a relaxing, and tantalizing ambiance. If you select the basic option you are given three courses, including a dessert. I had a glass of Amazir red, a Moroccan wine, that paired nicely with my meal. This is definitely a delightful place for couples and groups. They had really gorgeous belly dancers who were very \"skilled\" at their profession, Lol. But make sure that if you are brave enough to shake it with these ladies that you have \"CASH AT HAND\" and tip accordingly :o)

Before you are served your hands are cleaned in a cute sort of ritualistic manner. Eating with your hands enhances the overall experience. If you are an average size lady, the portions may be a little big for you. However, I found myself falling in love more and more with every bite. The dessert was too much, but the overall meal kept my taste buds very excited. The servers weren't the most talkative, but I'm not sure if that was a cultural thing and that's just how Moroccan food is presented? Its also very easy to lose track of time, which makes this a great mini escape from Vegas without leaving Vegas.


Alex: 4 stars. I've never had authentic Moroccan food, so I'm unqualified to compare. All I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed with the taste. Very flavorful and well-prepared. We ordered the three-dish meal for $25 each (a solid deal) which came with cooked veggies and dip, chicken with couscous, and dessert. I had no complaints whatsoever about the food. The dancers were great, and made sure to keep the entire restaurant engaged; bring cash for tips to show your appreciation for their talent. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. Dance with the dancers, laugh, drink, be merry. I guess what keeps it from being a true 5-star for me is two things: First, though I love the belly-dancing music, between shows it slips into cheesy Vegas techno and kills the beautiful atmosphere they've created with the interior design and lighting. Second is the Welcome-Factor of the waiters. There is none. It's kind of a \"done yet?\" feeling.

Take friends, take in the atmosphere, and enjoy the delicious food...you don't wanna miss this place!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food was good. Yes, the ambiance was fabulous. Yes, the entertainers were splendid but, being made to feel like family was priceless. Every time we return to Las Vegas we will make sure to visit Marrakech Moroccan Restaurant. We had a spectacular time!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome really neat ambiance the belly dancers were very interactive and got the crowd dancing. As for the food it was definitely a lot by the time we got to the main entree we were stuffed. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Simply the best! The shrimp was to die for and the dessert was awesome! Best Mediterranean food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think I speak for myself when I say dining should be not only a palatable experience but a moral one. Now, where I'm from taking a 9 yr. old bride is not kosher, and neither is a middle-aged man preying on younger women on social media, especially women whose chastity is bound by an oath to God. Now what does that have to do with Marrakech's food? Absolutely nothing, I think.

The chicken I ordered was sprinkled with nuts of some sort. Now, I'm a fairly uneducated man, and to be frank, this ignorance is quite uninhibited, but I do think this chicken's integrity is compromised by such a gratuitous sprinkling of cashews, almonds and walnuts. The sauce was a curry, I think, and yellow, like the sort of \"man\" that fishes women out of their hijab with artful keystrokes and the peacock exuberance of wealth acquired young but earned a few generations ago. Bootstraps come cheaper when your parents couldn't ever be caught dead scraping bitumen out of a barrel for a colonial pound a week.

Also, the most palatable spice to the food here is the triple-filtered tap water and the midriffs swishing around our table-tents. 

The food is okay, the atmosphere is loud, and I'm talking a melange of Indian funk and the gut-wrenching undertones of pedophilia consorting with a babble of PIE languages and the smell of caterpillar smoke."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service is great and the food is awesome!! Went once and I am hooked."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Husband & I were visiting Las Vegas, had never had Moroccan food, so we decided to give this a try.

We had NO idea what to expect, so we were seated & sat around like goons for a minute (despite the fact that the restaurant has a big placard right inside the front door describing what to expect).  

As mentioned in most reviews, this is a prix fixe menu (about $40 a person) serving six courses.  No menu necessary.  

Everything was very good.  The highlight was the 'salad' (really more of an appetizer plate, but described on the menu as salad, and served as the third course), with beets, carrots, hummus, tzatziki, and olives.  Loved it.  The steak skewers were also fabulous.  The chicken and couscous was pretty bland, but by that time, we were so stuffed with great food that we could forgive this.

Also worth note - the dessert.  Holy cow.  I'm not a big fan of dessert, but this was amazing...a huge plate of something similar to baklava.  Lots of phyllo dough with walnuts, honey, some type of fruit (pear?  apple?) and baked.  And lots of it!  Yyeeaahh!!!

Service was good...they just kept bringing the food.  My husband thought the belly dancer was great & wished that she had performed more than once in the hour & a half that she was there.

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"We went here looking for something unusual and were pleasantly surprised with the really excellent and tasty food quality.  As other reviews note, tons of good food.  Prix-fix menu.  First course, shrimp scampi, was happily devoured by all.  The soup dish was the \"ho-hum\" course; nothing bad but not very interesting either.  The hummus / baba ganoush course was really high quality with bonus flourishes like olives and marinated carrots to take it up a notch.  Meat skewers were really tender, very above average.  Chicken cous-cous was a bit \"ho-hum\" for me but others in my family insisted it was amazing.  All this in a cozy setting (looks like you are in a tent) and multiple performances by some rather sexy belly dancers who I think did a good job keeping the female guests (e.g. my wife) feeling engaged and part of the fun."}
{"text":"This is a fun experience just off the strip in Vegas. A six course pre-fix Moroccan feast and the food is delicious. Pace yourself as you will not leave hungry. Belly dancing is included as part of the fun. The restaurant is decorated so that you feel you are sitting in a Sultan's tent. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great way to end my trip to Vegas. This place is awesome! Excellent food and customer service! Definitely coming here again! :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Perfect date spot if you arent worried about price. Definitely call and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Love going here, the food is awesome! It is decorated like a Moroccan tent and can't forget about the belly dancing! so much fun"}
{"text":"A must visit when in Las Vegas.  It was nice to get off the strip for an evening out.  The ambiance is cozy and lounge like.  It is a 6 course pre fix meal for $49; worth every penny.
Come hungry as the portions are large.  We began with our hands being washed with rose water; a wonderful touch.  Ordered a red wine by the bottle which was very good; a recommendation from the waiter.  Keep your bread so you can dip it and enjoy it with all the dishes.  The belly dancer was great ~ she came out twice when we were there; and was very talented.  Feel free to tip her!   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with our family the Wed night before Thanksgiving.  We felt bad for making a late reservation (8:45pm), but when we called they assured us it was no problem.  They were very accommodating as we had a late addition for a party of 9.

The waiters were nice.  Service was good.  The mojito wasn't that great, but the wine was good and reasonably priced.  

I've never had Moroccan before, but love Mediterranean food, so was optimistic.  The food at Marrakech was great.  We did the prefix and everything as really good.  Started with a soup, then hummus plate, then shrimp, a chicken dish, and desert.  There was way more food than needed, but they were nice about letting us take the leftovers home so as not to go to waste.  

They also had a belly dancer, which was pretty cool.  Although it was a bit uncomfortable as we didn't really know what the etiquette is for tipping.  We gave her a few singles, and she seems to appreciate it.  So hope we did the right thing.  

With food, wine, and tip it came out to be about $70 per person, which I think is reasonable.   Overall I'd definitely recommend Marrakech.  Good food and experience."}
{"text":"Food was great and lots of it! Belly dancing was a nice extra. Good service. The only dish we had issues with was the chicken plate, it was very bland and was the only dish that we didn't have seconds of."}
{"text":"We spent the New Year's 2012 eve there. It WAS a unique dining experience alright - nevermore, thank you. Not fun. Not tasty. Disappointing in every respect.  
My husband is Moroccan. Naturally I had high expectations for the place knowing the taste of Moroccan cuisine. Trust me, the taste of dishes could not have been more disappointing. How can you guys call yourself Moroccan restaurant when you cook the cous-cous without the basic ingredients?!?! The cous-cous we had was cooked without pumpkin, potato and chickpeas!! Only cabbage. Well, some slices of carrots, too. While It's the Traditional Moroccan dish! Unbelievable... 
Now for the dessert. Bastilla filed with chocolate and banana? Where did you get that recipe? It's a BAD mix of Moroccan and American tastes, if this is whet you were attempting to recreate. Hardly eatable... 
Now for the famous mint tea. We were not served that at all. Guess, they have decided that free champagne is a good substitute. Well, it was not. By the way, from the color of tea we saw being poured to a couple from another table, we can assume that it is not the best-tasting Moroccan tea either.     
As for the entertainment, the dancing lady was lovely! BUT if we had entered the restaurant 10 minutes later - we would have missed her completely. And that was the ONLY entertainment offered for the New Year's eve. Don't even want to mention the music screaming as loudly as it only could from the speakers above our ears. And it was some stupid pop songs, not even a hint to oriental tunes!! Or was it a special offer due to the New Year's eve? Another bad idea, gentlemen.  
The entourage is shocking at first as everyone are sitting in front of each other, in one large hall. But you get used to it, so OK for a change.  
All in all, we could NOT have been more disappointed by the restaurant. It by no means cost $140. The only reason why I asked the waited to pack the remains of our food to-go, was cuz I wanted to give the bastilla and the cous-cous another chance by eating them at home. It did not help..."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Intimate, exotic, with good food and great service. They took care of our 19 person group with grace and aplomb, despite our musical chairs-like mingling and special dietary needs. Family style food was generous in portions and really good. It's ambiance is warm and romantic without being cloying or claustrophobic. The belly dancers add great entertainment and atmosphere and are never obnoxious or in the way of conversation and enjoyment of the evening. Great for big groups or small."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit when in Vegas. I always highly recommend this place to everyone I know that goes to Vegas. Not once has it let me down, food is delicious but the atmosphere is priceless."}
{"text":"My relatives are visiting from Japan and I decided to treat them to Marrakech for dinner. They are thoroughly impressed and satisfied with the high quality service, the exquisite food, and the unique experience.  Marrakech is an amazing dining experience. The chef, Elias, is very talented and prepares the most delicious cuisine imaginable. Our host, Hany, is great! The service that he provides is top of the line. Aradia, the belly dancer, gave a fun and engaging performance.  We love the Marrakech team!"}
{"text":"What a fun and great place to have a wonderful five course meal, light hearted entertainment and good conversation with friends.  It feels like you are in Morocco.  Nicely done, like being in a tent in the Sahara.  The food was fantastic.  Especially liked the skewered meat.  The Moorish hospitality was excellent with washing of hands before and oil on the hands after.  The mint tea was great.  Drank three pots.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.  Have been there six times for birthdays, holidays and just time to spend with family and friends.  I would highly recommend the place.  I love it.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been coming here since I was about 10 years old. The owner is awesome and attractive:). The ambience is great, and the food is traditional and always delicious. The food is a little pricy, but for a six course meal, belly dancers, and one of the only Moroccan restaurants I know of, I think it's pretty reasonable. If you decide to eat here, you must have an open mind. You eat Moroccan style with your hands, the seats are low to the ground, and the restaurant is designed to look like a tent upon entering. The cornish game hen (not chicken as it has been referred to in numerous posts) is one of the best dishes. However, it is the 5th course, so make sure you leave enough room to try it!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm blown away with how tasty their food is. Being a vegan and was out with meat lover friends, it was great how we could all be around each other and eat whatever we want. Staff is amazing. Love the inside, makes me want to go to Morocco! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas with people who are new, I always want to take them to Marrakech...and for me who is a decidedly indecisive person, a fixed menu is perfect. 

Basics, dimly lit, good for groups (make a reservation...this is good too because there's plenty of food to go around), loud (esp every 30 min when the belly dancing starts up). You will definitely be propositioned at least once during the meal to dance with the belly dancer, and hey! why not? :) You're in Vegas and what happens here stays here right?

I would come here just for the experience, takes about 2 hours. And if not for the experience, for the DESSERT! Gooey, hot amalgamation of bananas, chocolate and slivered almonds wrapped in phyllo dough, baked up to a flaky moon of perfection and covered with a heaping helping of powdered sugar and cocoa powder.

TIP: come hungry, bring friends, don't eat everything that you see since you probably want to save room for the rest of the meal.

Gluten Free: also, came with a friend who was allergic to gluten. They asked at the beginning of the meal and make entirely separate dishes to make it gluten free. That's an automatic plus one star for me. Sadly the dessert I mentioned above was cold and chunky since phyllo dough was out of the question so it was not baked, but otherwise still tasty."}
{"text":"Food need a revamp, it looks like a mess and taste bland...shame, because Moroccan food is full of flavor, this restaurant used to be great few years ago, now it's all about belly dancing and liquor.  Too bad...maybe it's time for a real moroccan restaurant in Vegas"}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday a few months ago . Absolutely love the food , the lentil soup is my favorite"}
{"text":"I held my wedding reception here last month and it was the best decision! Tariq, the owner of Marrakech, helped me get everything set up the way I wanted it. He even touched base with me a couple of times before the date. I honestly didn't stress about a thing. Extra communication = happy bride/customer :) 

The food was delicious and the portions were HUGE. The shrimp scampi was my personal favorite. The steak was cooked perfectly. And the banana chocolate pastry + mint tea was a great end to the meal. It felt great to hang out with everyone in our own section, as opposed to sitting around a stuffy reception hall. 

The service was wonderful. Several of my guests had questions and the servers were more than happy to explain the different dishes. The ambiance and belly dancers were the cherry on top. Everyone left with full bellies and told me they had the best time. After running around all day, my husband and I were happy to just relax and spent time with our loved ones. 

So basically... if you've got a special event coming up, talk to Tariq. He'll take care of you and make sure you have an absolutely wonderful evening. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and had a wonderful experience. The food, atmosphere, and service was excellent. We ordered the 6 course dinner which was amazing. It was definitely a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Impressed! Company party so we had the 6-course meal and it was delicious!! 
No utensils and we had a blast!!
Enjoyed the belly dancer and the music set the tone in a good way. 
A must!!"}
{"text":"This is a quiet little gem on Paradise. I've been to its neighbor ,Firefly, a bazillion times and always wondered what lingered to the south. Now I know and this will be a must for out of town guests.

Bellydancers while binging on beef kabobs? Why not?

One of the most pleasant surprises involves rose water. The other tea."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4 stars, but I'll have to give it 3 for the following two reasons:
1) Only two prix fixe menu: a six course for $39.95, or a three course for $24.95
2) The food is good, but not amazing. Definitely not the best hummus, cous cous, or kebabs I've had, but still good.

I had the three course menu, which has two options. The first is soup, salad, and then the entree. The second is salad, entree, and then the dessert. I don't really have a sweet tooth, so I went with the former.

The soup was a lentil soup, that came with some bread. The bread was nothing special, but I thought the lentil soup was excellent, especially since I'm not a fan of lentils. The salad was basically some carrots, olives, and cucumbers with hummus and a eggplant sauce/hummus. I enjoyed both and thought it was definitely above average. For the entree, I had roasted chicken and vegetables over some cous cous. The cous cous was excellent, flavorful and moist, while the chicken was just decent. 

The real star of the meal was the pot of mint tea I ordered. Slightly on the sweet side, but it was some of the best mint tea I've ever had. Highly recommended. 

TL;DR: Get the mint tea; the food is good, but a little pricy."}
{"text":"ive never had moroccan food before, i met a girlfriend there for dinner. she knew the owner of the place. He was very nice and helpful, great costumer service. he sat us right away. its couch seating with a little round table in front of you. they have belly dancers that come out and perform. they bring out a bunch of different dishes. shrimp, coos coos, amazing dessert, kabob with different types of meat. a tomato based soup. everything you eat with your hands. the drinks were nice and strong. very nice experience, had a lot of fun and food was delicous. ill definatley be going back"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places in Vegas to celebrate with a group or bring out of town guests!  Have had WONDERFUL experiences here since I was a little girl.  Recently though, they did a private luncheon (40 men & women) for Admin Day for my work and what a hit!  They were very accommodating to our group's needs and really helped me tailor the experience to our celebration.  Everyone LOVED the food and the belly dancing!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here last summer and what a memorable experience it was! It's been over a year and we still talk about it. We made a reservation for 5 people and were seated at a nice corner table. The waiter was welcoming, courteous and friendly. We ordered their fixed price 6 course menu, which I believe was $45 per person, and a bottle of Moroccan wine - all absolutely delicious. 

First came their Shrimp Scampi sautéed in lemon. Then the Lentil soup, the hummus plate, and a couple other dishes. All amazing, tasteful and flavorful. For dessert, they brought some pastry cake stuffed with bananas and chocolate and we couldn't get enough! A belly dancer danced around while we were eating and was quite entertaining. We had a great time. 

We're all looking forward to go back on our next trip to Vegas. Must check out!"}
{"text":"I got the groupon. The food was great. I was way full and satisfied. The dancers were fun. The waiter was rude but I could overlook that because everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Great courses of food, I loved the shrimp scampi. The belly dance was enjoyable but I don't really like middle eastern / Indian music so was ok."}
{"text":"A-OK is definitely where this place sits.  My biggest gripe is the lack of a menu selection.  I am allergic to seafood and don't eat hummus or cornish game hens so there went half the meal.  What I did eat was delish.  After tax and tip it comes out to about $55 a person which is incredibly steep if you don't eat every single piece of food put in front of you.  One of the other reviewers outlined the courses and that's still accurate.  The beef kebabs are incredible and the soup was good.  

The entertainment is fun.  Thy have a middle eastern dancing girl who periodically comes out in in costume and belly dances.  It's fun and sexy but still something the kids can see.  She's very engaging and has enough savvy to engage the people who want to be engaged while still understanding that no from us 'sticks in the mud' means no.  This is definitely worth visiting at least once.  It's an experience!"}
{"text":"Loved it, had a great time!

The ambiance and the belly dancing were wonderful.

The food was great too. 

Definitely a fun place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"the ambience was amazing...the staff were very professional and the food can't get enough stars. the in dining entertainment featuring the beautiful belly dancer displayed taste at its finest."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's almost and year since my wedding day. My wife asked what were my plans for our 1st ann. dinner. My answer simply Marrakech!! Where we held our Wedding day reception at,  Many of our guest are still talking about the FOOD, SHRIMP, MINT TEA, DESERT AND EVEN THE BREAD This place is the true GEM of Las Vegas! 
Never had a bad moment in this Sultan's palace, that's the way they make all their guests feel.
I have been enjoying here for the past 15 years, Ali and his family are the BEST!
Each course better than the next ! Needless to say every March we'll be there! 
GO ENJOY TIP YOUR BELLY DANCERS !!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for a few years and I think it's new owners the outside is more inviting and the inside and music isn't as dated as it used to be. The food and staff was wonderful and we were even entertained by a very nice belly dancer. It's a 6 course meal that can't be beat for $50 per person and the wine is fairly priced too. This a a great romantic spot to bring your date. Just come hungry the amount of food you receive is a little overwhelming.  No it may not be for family's it's really a romantic spot. So if your looking to bring your family with kids this probably isn't the place for you. It's an experience, a show, fine dining and a true gem!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Phenomenal in every way! Start to finish. 
Loved it here! The interior was fabulous.
The food was excellent. Portion sizes were huge. 
The entertainment was outstanding. 
These women are beautiful! They know how to dance!! And their figures are healthy! What women should be! 
We will be dining here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome! If you want to try something fun and different I highly recommend it. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is that I think it is a little overpriced. But other than that, great food (6 course meal), friendly staff that worked with my wife to provide a vegetarian option. They even have belly dancers starting at 6ish about every hour. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Can you say a fun spot ? Was getting wined and dined for a business dinner and we didn't even need to with the fair pricing ! Loved the whole vibe of the restaurant and our waitress, Stephanie was adorable and knowledgeable. Will likely be one of our new Vegas hangouts !"}
{"text":"Went for my fiance's birthday this past weekend with some out-of-town friends. It was unique- you step into a \"Moroccan tent\" and has a great ambiance. The food was very good (shrimp scampi and the filet mignon were exceptional). Unfortunately, the service was something left to be desired. Our main waiter was not very attentive and was slightly rude at times. As a paying customer ($45 pp) I definitely expected more in the way of service. Not likely to return again."}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience while in Las Vegas. 

I've been to Marrakech Morroccan Restaurant twice in the last two years, both times were very enjoyable experiences. They serve a fixed price menu containing several dishes. It's a good idea to be hungry when you arrive. The chicken cous cous really stood out from the other dishes. The chicken fell off the bone, and the sauce that came with it was subtle and delicious. The Morrocan Mojito's are delicious, and a nice 16oz glass for $14. 

The staff was attentive (almost too eager to clear our plates when we were taking a pause due to our overloaded bellies), and very friendly. 

The belly dancing is outstanding, and there is lots of audience participation. Good vibes and great food at the Marrakech. Plan to spend about 2 hours there to get the full experience."}
{"text":"The minute you walk in it's like you've stepped into a tent in the middle of the dessert. Which, I guess, is kind of true. Anyway, we had Opentable reservations (definitely try and make reservations because the restaurant is small and they are often sold out completely for the evening) and a Groupon. We opted for the six course meal (we had fasted in preparation) but still could not eat all of it. While it's not commonly advertised, they do a smaller prix fix and an a la cart menu as well, so if you're not prepared for the six courses, ask or they probably won't tell you about it. The inside of the restaurant is amazing and beautiful; it really makes the ambiance fun and probably even makes the food taste better (not that it needs to, it's wonderful too). Every course was great even though we couldn't eat all of it and they do have utensils too, thankfully. The dancers were fun to watch and they weren't too pushy in getting people to dance (usually the drunk or bald guys would get picked on). The music when the dancers weren't present was at a great volume for talking. My friend and I had a great time, it was a wonderful experience and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance. This is definitely one of the top restaurants I recommend to people, as it's one of my favorites. Unfortunately some people don't like to live a little and get all weirded out when I explain it to them... pshhh. Their shrimp scampi is TO DIE FOR! I love every course, from start to finish. Washing your hands with rose water is a lovely touch, and you can't forget the guys who know how to pour tea! And who doesn't like watching the lovely belly dancers?! Some belly dancers seem to be more skilled than others, but it's always fun nonetheless! Have been coming here for over 10 years and hope they continue to keep things top notch!"}
{"text":"Tacky and Unrefined....but I'm not talking about Chicken Wings...


This Moroccan restaurant has figured out a working business model.  They use the lack of other Moroccan restaurants in the area, plus belly dancers, plus interesting decor, all to distract customers from the sub par food and poor service.  

We did the 6 course tasting menu for $40.  Much of the food tasted like it was sitting out at a buffet, and some unhappy waiter just brought it to our table.  For the money that you will spend here, you can actually go to a good buffet, even though you may have to get the food yourself.  

The mint tea at the end of the meal was heavenly.  It was soothing, and left a very pleasant taste on my palette, which helped distract from the other flavors that were there prior.  


If you're looking for dinner and a show, get some Teppenyaki.  If you want mediocre food while eating in what feels like a magic lamp, I guess you found the right place.  

There is nothing magical about this lamp, and no genie either.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best restaurant and entertainment experience I and all of my friends have ever had. The service and entertainment was superior and the food was incredible! Worth every penny although for 4 people it was only $45 per person which is a steal considering the incredible environment, ambiance and entertainment available here with impeccable taste, decor, style, and flair.
We will now make this a regular stop to our trek to Las Vegas. You will not be disappointed unless you don't like good food and fantastic entertainment."}
{"text":"One word: AWESOME!!! =D

I was in Vegas last week for my best friend's bachelorette/birthday weekend. While planning, we needed to figure out a dinner location that would fit the occasion, not too expensive and had a prefix meal. I came across Marraheck Moroccan, got the bride to be's approval and made a reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, it was as though we were transported to a fancy tent in Morroca, the decorations were beautiful and there was a lot of drapery. We had a little issue with the seating at first because they had us all side on couches on one side of the table (not very good for conversation) and when we asked to be switched to another table or for more chairs on the other side of the table, our waiter was not accomedating, so I went and grabbed chairs from another table so that we could have 3 girls on one side of the table and 4 girls on the other side. HOWEVER, i must say that our waiter made up for his original rudeness because when we ordered our meal, we told him that we had one vegan and one girl who cannot eat cinammon, he made sure that their meals fitted their needs. There were two belly dancers who performed during the night, super fun to watch. Especially when we pushed our bride to be to go dance. We got the 6 course meal, and wow...everything was absolutely delicious! We were going clubbing after dinner, so I didn't plan on eating too much since I didn't want to have a little belly, but I COULD NOT stop eatting! Everything was just sooo good! When dessert came, they made a small one with no cinnamon and one vegan one to accomedate the the diets of the allergic and vegan. That was super nice of them to do that. I forgot to mention the yelp deal so we didn't get the 15% discount, but I was so happy with the meal that I don't care. It was a great meal, great ambiance, and great people =)."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just to write this restaurant a review. If I could give them ZERO stars I would! My parents were going to Vegas for the first time to celebrate their 25th anniversary, and this is the first time they have gone on a trip together with just the two of them (having 4 kids makes it difficult for them to get away!) 

Well, I saw the great reviews for this restaurant and a groupon deal so I bought it as a gift for them. They showed up to the restaurant and the RUDE lady at the front told them that since they didn't have a reservation, they can't eat there, and that if they wanted to eat there they would have to come back ANOTHER DAY and that there were other restaurants in the area and that they should try something else. WHAT THE F WORD!??? My poor parents, who are not used to taking cabs (we live in the suburbs) asked if they could help call them a cab, and they said yeah we'll call someone but you're going to have to wait outside. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET MY PARENTS WAIT INSIDE FOR A CAB!! It's December, winter, and I double checked the website and did not see mandatory reservation required anywhere!!!! While they waited outside for 45 mins, people walking by looked and stared and no cab ever came. My dad had to go hail a cab outside in the main streets for them.

They decided to go to this restaurant on a weds night at 6:30, and were rudely turned away and after cabbing here from their hotel, had to cab back. My mom said she has never felt so lowly, degraded, and embarrassed before from this awful customer service and it was a horrible way to end their 25th anniversary. Really Marrakech... no room on a WEDNESDAY night to fit in 2 people?! And asking them to leave your restaurant? I will be writing the owner a letter. SO DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"saw Philip's review a month or so ago and it reminded me ( after eating at firefly and dragonfly several times ) that i need to hit this place. 

'm trying to figure out how this place makes $$. The price is very reasonable for what you get. i liked everything - especially the shrimp and the chicken - it ain't high end stuff but decent . 

my roomie was convinced the dancer was trying to pick-up on me - all i can say is, IN MY DREAMS !! She did make a point to come by after the dance to talk to me - one of those, \" don't i know you from somewhere ? \" 

thank god, it turns out she's a friend of a friend , then again, i think it might have been more fun/interesting if she was trying to pick up on me !

If i had to arrange for a lively dinner for a group, this place is in my top 5 - especially if $$ is an issue.

Happy Eating !"}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed!!!

Great ethnic Moroccan cuisine, belly dancers, beautiful atmosphere. Wish I could eat like this everyday. The price might seem high at first, but I swear it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"food was good definitely different from my culture. Everyone recieved a six different dish"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Overpriced and underspiced.

Cons: Not worth $40 for dinner. Maybe $30, but still pushing it for me.The soup was clearly from a can - tasted like cheap Campbell's vegetable soup to me, no flavor, had that tin taste. Bread was okay, nothing special, clearly purchased from a factory. Everything was underspiced and a little bland, which sucks because one of the things I love (and expect!) about food from this region is the flavor. The red wine I had was good, but not $11/glass good. Maybe $6.

Pros: kebabs were yummy, put a couple drops of lemon juice on them for a different flavor. Can't go wrong with hummus and cucumbers. The shrimp (though a bit tough) had a nice sauce. Dessert was yummy and went well with coffee (they give you mint tea, but ask for the coffee instead). Chicken was pretty good. Large portions, my party of 3 had plenty of food to go around. Decor was lovely and the dancing girls were a crowd pleaser. Service was spot on.

I think this was once a nice restaurant experience with authentic food, but management was losing money or wanted to make more money so they cut corners with the food. Typical, but sad. Marrakesh, make a fresh soup and your own bread. Stop outsourcing. Add a little love and flavor into the food. You're not doing yourselves any favors by Americanizing your menu. Sure, you advertise and get the tourists... but what about the locals like myself who would make it a regular thing if you had better food? Do you want someone to spend money once or many times?

Until they get their kitchen in order and their chef in line, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The husband took me here for my birthday and we both enjoyed the entertainment and food.  We loved everything about this place. The restaurant was very cozy and intimate. They even pour rose water over your hands so you can wash them at your table.  The experience itself was hands down amazing!

Now you gotta come here HUNGRY cause they do offer a 6 course meal (yes 6 courses) and I must say, by the time we got to the main course we were FULL. Probably our fault since we loaded on the Morroccan bread ;) But that bread dipped in the shrimp scampi sauce...heaven!  I especially loved their hummus and babaganoush plate. If you're like me and love roasted eggplant, you'll love the babaganoush - it was packed with so much flavor! The beef kabobs were so yummy that I wished they offered more especially since I thought that was the main course, but I was wrong. The main course came after and honestly, we were already stuffed we just couldn't eat anymore. Which was okay since I wasn't too impressed with the chicken and couscous. The chicken was on the dry side and I think the only thing I enjoyed was the veggies on the plate. But if you love sweets, you'll love their dessert though.  It reminded me of a huge baklava puffed up. It was yummy!

Now for the entertainment, the main reason the husband took me here for my birthday - the belly dancers. It was the first time for both of us and it was fun! There were two dancers that night. We did get up and dance with one of the dancers. It was a fun experience since she was teaching both of us how to belly dance :) She made the experience even better. 

All in all I would definitely recommend this place. From the service we received, to the entertainment and to the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wine, entertainment, atmosphere and dining experience! I have been here about 50 times!"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but it nearly put a hole in my pocket ($40/person). It was my bad since I didn't look at the price menu before walking in BUTI left SA-TIS-FIED! When I was working in Vegas, I discovered this spot one night when a friend and I were just feeling some Mediterranean food.

It was a six course meal that left me wanting more and more and more....MMmmm the Shrimp Scampi were delish! The game hen was so tender and savory, the meat just fell right of the bones and into my salivating mouth. The hummus with veggies were also to die for. The belly dancer were entertaining as well. 

I only wish that they had lunch specials or something for half price during the day, you know without all the oohhs and ahhhs, entertainment, and fancy shamancy shiet. I'm selfish. I know. I just want to be able to afford you in this economic crisis...."}
{"text":"It's hard to pick a place solely based on reviews and I was iffy ... but we went and it was awesome!!!!!!  Food was amazing and potions plentiful, service was great, ambience was exactly what I was hoping for! Small and intimate -a definite must-experience!!"}
{"text":"Great Moroccan food and service. They have six courses dinner so delicious for $50 a bit expensive but worth it. Remember six courses enough for two .."}
{"text":"After lunch at Firefly we looked up Marrakech which was in the same strip mall. Unfortunately we were flying out that day. Fortunately, our flight was delayed 3 hours so we cabbed it from the airport here, had a delicious 6-course meal for $40, a unique experience, and got on the plane happily full. The only other places like this is one i can think of in LA, where there are belly dancers and the ceremonial-like hand washing as well as pouring of the Moroccan mint tea!
The belly dancer was actually asian but whatever. she was good and entertaining, and she came out occasionally so it wasn't overboard. My fave course was the chicken couscous. It filled me up after multiple dishes of non-hot appetizer-like dishes (all very good but nothing like steaming hot food). The dessert was over-the-top and huge for us 2. It was warm, made with sliced bananas, chocolate, flaky goodness, and sprinkled with confectionary sugar and cinnamon. so darn good! we couldn't finish it. Would def go back. Great for an adventurous date and a pretty authentic meal in Vegas. Next time, all my meals will be on Paradise Drive."}
{"text":"Everyone was so nice and very avoid sting for my gluten allergy. I can't wait to go back. Loved seeing the belly dancers and an amazing atmosphere. I love the ambience of the culture as well."}
{"text":"I felt like I was eating and lounging in a genie bottle.

The atmosphere was dimly lit with booths and tables low to the ground.  My friend took a few of us girls to this spot and we ordered the 6 course pre-fixe menu.  We ate with our hands and shared everything.  They bring out food portioned to the size of your party.  My favorite course was the 5th, which was slow cooked chicken with couscous.

A belly dancer came out twice during our one and a half hour stay and we tipped her dollars in her belt and she seduced the crowd with her grace and talented body control.  She was amazing and the experience as a whole was unlike any other."}
{"text":"Jiggy jiggy jiggy... that's the shake of the belly dancer that entertains as you begin to embark on an amazing 6-course meal at Marrakech.

If you're feeling adventurous, or just need a break from the Vegas strip, make your way here. It's not too far but far enough that you forget about the chaos that's just around the corner.

Located in a non-descript shopping plaza, you wouldn't realize you were actually about to be transported to Morrocco itself. The decor is amazing - you are in a tent! The tables are low, everything is authentic... nothing big-box manufactured.

We opted for the 6-course meal and I assure it's a lot of amazing food and it's great because it leaves all the thinking to the restaurant and yes, they have a vegetarian option.

Here's the breakdown:
1st course: sautéed shirmp (mushrooms for me) in a garlic butter/white wine reduction sauce.. O.M.G. I ASKED FOR BREAD SO I WOULDN'T NEED A STRAW TO DRINK THE SAUCE.

2nd course: lentil soup. Was really well flavored... you could really taste the cumin, fennel seeds.. it was vegetarian. Oddly they didn't give you utensils... but now that I am thinking about it, we didn't use utensils throughout the meal.. (ah, now that wonderful rose hand wash at the beginning of the meal makes so much sense).

3rd course - kebobs served on a pineapple. Delish and perfectly cooked

4th course: hummus, babaganoush - good hummus. I think it was more of a palette cleanser

5th course: chicken and couscous - wowza. The chicken (according to the hubster) fell off the bone. The couscous was really good too... cooked in a saffron broth

6th course: I can't even begin to explain what this was... it was like a bakalava, banana pie cake thing of amazing-ness. I wish I had more room for it.

So go... pack your stretchy pants and dancing shoes (because you must dance with the belly dancer), venture off the strip and go to Morroco."}
{"text":"POSITIVES:

Great Service  - Our server, Ali, made this a top notch experience.  He was pleasant, charming, attentive, quick, and very accommodating.  

Good Food - Some of the 7 items were hits and some were miss, but overall the meal was satisfying.  The shrimp seemed a bit overcooked, it was almost rubbery.  The soup that followed was like canned soup.  Everything that followed was good, especially the kabob which was flavorful and tender.  There was so much food that by the 6th plate, I was so full that I could barely put a dent in the chicken or dessert.  Thankfully they let you take leftover food home.  

Ambiance - The restaurant itself is very cozy and ethnic looking, at least that's what it's going for.  I've never been to Morocco so I don't know how authentic it all is, but they did a good job in making the customer feel like they've left Vegas and entered a Moroccan lounge. 

Talented belly dancers - they come out once every hour and a half and dance for 10 minutes.  

NEGATIVES: 

Lack of menu options

Shrimp tasted like rubber

Soup tasted like canned soup

CONCLUSION:

If it were my restaurant, I'd replace the shrimp scampi plate with something else, get rid of the soup, and maybe throw some more options in the menu that allow the customer to have more variety.  The current 7 course meal is fine for the first time customer, but I don't see how this business would attract repeat customers using the same foods."}
{"text":"Great Staff, Great Food, and WOW can they dance! I would come back anytime. Before they brought out the main course I was full, left alot of food, since I am in a hotel on the strip, but had a ton we could bring home."}
{"text":"Dining at Marrakech has become a tradition of my friends' annual trip to Vegas and I was delighted to be able to join them this year. The restaurant is located off strip so prepared to take a cab. 

Yes, the dining room is one large room and fairly small compared to other Vegas restaurants, but I liked the ambiance, finding that it lent to the intimacy of the experience. Guests are seated on couches at low tables. Be prepared to eat with your hands (they do provide rose water for cleansing before dining.) 

I enjoyed almost all of the food during the six courses served: warm bread, shrimp, soup, steak kabobs, chicken and rice, and a banana & chocolate souffle-type pastry. While the food wasn't mind-blowing, I did enjoy it. 

Belly dancing is dispersed throughout the evening. The women will encourage others to get up and dance with them. I was too shy, but one of my friends got up and had a great time. 

Overall I'm looking forward to returning again should I make it to Vegas next year."}
{"text":"Great food, but even better people!

We've been here twice with large groups and both times were excellent!!  Tariq ( the owner) was extremely quick and responsive when we were planning the event. He made it easy on us and when our party grew by about 10 people, they were still all smiles and helpful!

The food was amazing both times and I love that they have simple rates for everyone (one price for the meal and then an additional price if they wanted an open bar). This makes it very simple for large groups. We loved all the food, but I'm telling you the service is beyond anything I've experienced with a large group. We loved them!!! 

Do yourself a favor, and book them for your next event! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Last week I went with some girlfriends to Vegas for my 30th birthday (yay!) and we really wanted to try a unique restaurant...Marrakech fit the bill perfectly and I'm so happy we decided to be adventurous and leave the strip!

The decor is amazing...the second you walk through the door, you feel as though you've been swept out of the country.

The wait staff was attentive and extremely funny...our waiter dances for the ladies ;). The gal who did the belly dancing was entertaining, talented and very sweet. I admit, she got me up to shake my groove thing...though I'm not nearly as good at belly dancing as she was...but watch out...I may be working there soon. Ha!

The food was delicious. It is a 6-course set menu, starting with shrimp scampi that is buttery, garlicky and fantastic. Then the tomato lentil soup...nice and hearty but not too heavy. I liked the vegetables and hummus, but I don't think that was the favorite with the other gals. The beef kabobs were phenomenal. OMG, melt in your mouth good and I loved the presentation! Then the fall off the bone chicken and couscous was fabulous, but at this point we were getting so full that we left so much on the plate! Dessert was good, but not my cup of tea. I felt it was missing something, but not sure what. Oh and the tea they served was delicious...definitely the best part of dessert.

So next time you are in Vegas, be adventurous and go off the beaten path...you won't  be sorry!"}

{"text":"4 stars for the food and ambience, 3 stars for the service.

We were seated after 15 minutes of just standing there and the waiters ignoring us, when we had a reservation and there were plenty of available seats.

When we were finally seated, we waited another 20 minutes for a waiter to give us some water and bread. We came all the way from OC for this restaurant and you want us to just sit here forever?

The food finally arrives, and man, it was all good. Especially eating with your hands. And eating delicious food with your hands. I most especially love the beef kabobs. They were the most tender pieces of meat I have ever sunk my teeth into. It was like biting into a dream. Lol. I thought they were the main course! But there's more food! We were full by then and had to run to watch a show on the strip so we had to go... Regrettably. If not for the show, we would have stayed to keep watching the lovely and amazing belly dancer, and maybe tried some hookah. Or just lounge there and enjoy the ambiance and the dessert. 

We wish we could've been served better, though. We have a Groupon deal for four but they would only serve us food for two. It's like paying regular price when we could have taken the other food home and wallowed in the dreaminess of the tender beef. It was unfair! Just because our friends couldn't make it. And they made us wait forever. Anyway, I had a lot of fun an it was definitely a good experience. :)"}
{"text":"My husband took me here last month as a surprise for my birthday. The most unique experience ever and I was pleasantly surprised! I never had Moroccan food before, so I was a bit nervous. I also never experienced a 6 course meal before. This place blew my mind. The meal is set so there is no guessing over a menu on which items to order.The ambiance is amazing, its romantic, the food was delicious, and the experience is unforgettable. They even have a friendly belly dancer  that entertains you throughout your meal.
Great place to go for special occasions. Pricey, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe and the belly dancer was awesome. Food was just ok, although the dessert was really good and I loved the babaganoush. Had an enjoyable experience. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Great food! Great entertainment! Great serve! I am a local and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So much fun!! Marrakech is a perfect place to spend a evening filled with delicious food and dancing. A great escape from the endless buffets and crazy Vegas nightclub scene.

The pre fix menu keeps everything simple and allows you to relax and enjoy the ambiance and belly dancing the minute you are seated. To start with, the staff is very accommodating. We had a few vegetarians in our group and they happily gave us huge portions of both the vegetarian and meat dishes. Everything was delicious! Also they are very good with their timing in bring out the dishes, allowing you to actually enjoy the food, atmosphere and your company without feeling rushed to leave. By the time dessert came around, we were all ridiculously full and had it packed. 

Also the belly dancers were amazing! Loved how they were so inviting and brought up everyone to dance. They deserve 5 stars alone!

All in all, Marrakech definitely needs to a part of your Vegas visit!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people and great entertainment. Each course was scrumptious and perfectly seasoned. The owner Tariq was very accommodating and engaging.  The belly dancer was beautiful and so fun. Thanks for making my wife's birthday a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"One word - so funandamazing! Ok, I dont think that's really one word, but when you find a great place to eat and be entertained, you make some exceptions.   My military unit was staying nearbye this restaurant and a frequent visitor (new guy in the unit) wouldnt shut up about this place.  After finally being convinced to try the place, I soon found out the reason why he was so enthusiastic.

First of all they have a six course meal and it IS delicious.  From the start all the way til the end the food was delicious.  The very first dish was the shrimp scampi - this dish was the best shrimp scampi dish i've ever  had.  One word of advice, you have to try the bread and dip into the savory shrimp scampi sauce.  The next dish was the lentil soup.  I've only had a few bowls of this stuff, but the way this place makes it, it comes out very lemony and tasty.  The steak skewer was perfectly grilled and the rest of the meal was great. 

To finish it off, the tea that they give you was the perfect way to end it. Who would have ever thought that an extremley hot, sweet tea would be a nice way to end a meal.  Thanks to my friend who was so insistent on going here.  I've now found a place I must head to every time to vegas.  You can have your buffets, but this place rocks and I will now be a frequent customer every time I head to vegas.

ps - the belly dancer is amazing too ; )  best i've ever seen!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Marrakech in Vegas for as long as I can remember. So, when I saw a groupon for it we snatched that baby up and booked a reservation for July 4th weekend, during our recent trip to Vegas. The coupon helped tremendously, since there were 7 of us and this place is a tad on the expensive side, but for all you get, it is surely worth the price. 

Based on the food alone I would probably rate this restaurant 3 stars, but who goes here JUST for the food - no one. The experience is well worth the price and even though the food isn't the BEST I've ever had, it is pretty good. Stand outs for me are the shrimp appetizer with bread, which is so good. Soaking up that buttery, garlicky sauce with fresh bread is excellent. I love the hummus and pickled carrots. The soup is OK (I would cut this course out if I could). The beef kabobs are the BOMB! They are so well cooked and extra yummy. The chicken is moist, and the cous cous is good, but nothing special. The dessert was different this past time than it previously was. I liked how it used to be - nuts and chicken- this time it was bananas and chocolate and I'm allergic to bananas and I didn't know they were in there, so that was a bummer. 

The belly dancing MAKES this place. It's fun, and I love seeing my Husband get pulled up to dance with the girls. Cracks me up every time. I would say go to Marrakech for the experience at least once when you are in Vegas. It's off the strip, but well worth going... you'll have some funny trying something different and unique!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic off the wall spot. A very unique dining experience. Additionally, the customer service was amazing. Hani the manager went above and beyond to accommodate our large group. And was also very sensitive to the food allergies/sensitivities in our group, bringing special desserts and keeping the pita out of the dips for our gluten-free friend. The food was delicious, the belly dancing phenomenal. Highly recommended for a different experience in Vegas!  Thank you Hani!"}
{"text":"Love this place from the atmosphere the food the belly dancers everything. Prices are not cheap but that is ok because they keep the place clean and the staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"We read about this place in a list for unique dining experiences in Las Vegas and it was really a fun and delicious meal. The menu is price fixe and for $45 you get a 6 course meal that includes amazing bread, beef, and banana chocolate pastry. I would seriously consider fasting all day before this epic meal as we really struggled to eat it all because it's just so much food! Also definitely make a reservation as it's a very intimate space. Expect to spend some money but leave full and with a fun experience."}
{"text":"WHAT A DINNING EXPERIENCE!!

I was greeted by a hostess right outside the door.  As I took a few steps passed the door, I had to step through another doorway with hanging curtains-- then, I was transported to what seems like a magical far-away place (I had never experience anything like this before!!) The decor and setting of the place was outstanding! I felt like I was in an authentic Moroccan tent with draping fabrics on the ceilings; hookahs in the corners; low-leveled seatings and tables; dim lightings with lit candles; beautifully printed fabrics and carpets covered every space of the walls. 

This place has a prixe fixe  6 course menu--  $39.96 per person. My favorite was the Beef Brochette (Kabob). It was super (SUPER) juicy, tender and...definitely grilled to perfection! Be sure to dip them into the  two dips from the sampler's plate. The overall dining experience was  3.5/5. Not every dish was a hit nor was it a miss for me. It was definitely fun trying new things.

The belly dancers were amazing. It was mesmerizing to watch and entertaining at the same time. The music was thumping non-stop!!  

If you're all about experiencing new things and want to be transported out of Las Vegas for a few hours, definitely come check this place out. Be sure to mention that you came across this place on Yelp to get your 15% off from your entire bill. Reservation is required."}
{"text":"You step into a different world once you enter, dark and intimate. Dinner was a prefixe meal with 4-5 courses. Be very hungry when you come."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! There isn't much else I can say.  They accommodated our large party and modify there menu so we could make our show!  Food was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambience. Come hungry, they bring out so much food. It was pretty good but I would have preferred more spice. Was a little more expensive then we were expecting but the not over e top. The Belly dancers were great also, it topped off the ambience."}
{"text":"5 stars for Ambiance and Service!
Overall 3 stars because:
1) Customers cannot order from a menu and are offered only one choice: A Six Course Meal for a fixed price.
2) Though the six course meal clearly mentions Mint Tea which is served along with the dessert, if you want your mint tea earlier with your food they will charge you extra.
3) For 1 person: The six course meal with an added charge for asking for the Mint Tea with my food was $ 54 (tip not included).
4) You cannot eat and leave quickly. The whole thing takes a lot of time and so you should be prepared to spend a lot longer than most places. 

- As you can see this is a more expensive place than the average because you are forced to spend a fixed amount which is much higher than an average entree by itself since you are paying for six courses.

If you wanted to have a meal for less $ than that then this is not a place you want to go to.

If you don't mind the cost, have plenty of time and would like to have a unique experience of being inside a Moroccan tent with soft lighting, music, belly dancing and an authentic feeling ambiance then this is the place for you. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The six course meal is to die for!  By the time we reached the fourth we were stuffed.  Everything was flavorful and presented beautifully.  The service and belly dancers were spectacular."}
{"text":"This was a different experience. It's a price fixed menu (or at least thats what they sell strongly).  It's a great place to go with a group and enjoy the belly dancer and the unique music and decor. It's an overall very entertaining experience. The food is definitely middle eastern (you eat by hand) but the chicken and the spices were excellent."}
{"text":"Took my husband out for his bday - I've been wanting to try this for a while, but had not had the chance. Went with three other people. Loved it! The only thing I wish is that they didn't rush you with the food - we were only done with one entree before they brought the other ones. 
Otherwise - we were still eating and they would bring out the next entree. Other than that, atmosphere is great, but the belly dancers (who were amazing btw) don't come out every 40 minutes like the waiter told us initially. We got there at 8:00 pm and saw one show, and then at 9:25 the other belly dancer came out... the girls are amazing and it's great to see them dance, but I just wish that they would have let us know that when we came in as opposed to telling us they came out every 40 mins. 

As far as the food goes, it's super delicious. It's a price fixe meal but they're pretty flexible - we were four people and we got 3 price fixe meals. We still had leftovers. 

Overall, great atmosphere, delicious food, and amazing belly dancers! Moroccan wine is great (we ordered two bottles) :) - and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food.

Outstanding Moroccan food. Each dish in our set course for our large group was delicious all the way to the puff pasty dessert.

The belly dancer is entertaining, but she scolded me when I took a picture of her. I guess you are supposed to tip to take a picture. Oh sorry, maybe you should put up a sign. That or maybe just be nice instead."}
{"text":"I bought a deal off Groupon - $30 for $65 worth of food, and used it during the 4th of July weekend with 5 other people. If I had to pay full price, I would not come here.

Food is mediocre. You can say you're \"paying for the experience\", but the experience was whatevers too. I like the decor, but that was about it. The belly dancer is not that great either.  You can probably find a better Morrocan Restaurant that serves even better food."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant accidentally when I was visiting Vegas. I searched for a Mediterranean place for dinner on yelp and Marrakech came up as one with the highest rates. The dinner style was different than usual, it was full course dinner that consisted of six different dishes: lentil soup, shrimp scampi, sides, kabob platter, couscous platter, B'stilla chocolate. The portions were generous and definitely too much for one person to eat in one setting. I took out the left over in boxes and ate it next day. Surprisingly the food was still fresh and delicious. 

Marrakech is absolutely worth trying."}
{"text":"We just finished our meal at Marrakech for the first time. Great food, fun atmosphere, great service.. but when it was time for our party of 31 to split the tab for over $2,300 it became a little difficult to accommodate everyone. The host had checked with management prior to this large engagement as to whether the check could be split among such a large party. Management assured her that it was no problem only to find out upon completion of the meal that there was no other option but to pay it as one large tab. Ridiculous. Not to mention, they tried to charge us for 6 guests that were not in attendance and that reservations had not been made for. Some mix up about the number of people that was supposed to show up. When the host asked to speak to the manager, the guy said he would go get him and he came back as the manager. Aside from that, the entire experience was phenomenal. 

Our party opted for the six course vegetarian Moroccan feast which consisted of sautéed mushrooms and zucchini, harira soup, sampler of hummus, Baba Ghannouj (eggplant/tahini dip), olives, cucumbers and carrots, grilled veggie kabob (zucchini, eggplant, onion, and tomato), couscous platter minus the chicken, and a beautiful dessert pastry filled with fruits, chocolate, and nuts. The prefixe meal also came with mint tea and homemade bread. We had to devour the first four courses without utensils which was really fun because the bread acted as a scooping and soaking element. I was quite relieved when forks appeared for the couscous. I think that would have been challenging to use just hands and fingers.

The entertainment was the highlight of the evening at the restaurant. The belly dancers were talented and beautiful. They came out to dance twice during our visit and brought up some of the guests in our party to do some belly dancing with them as well. The servers were also very friendly, prompt, and attentive.

All in all, Marrakech was a wonderful dining experience. However, I do not recommend this place for large parties."}
{"text":"Well, this was the first time I had gone out for Moroccan cuisine, but my wife and I were feeling like something different and some Vegas locals had recommended it.  
I was pleasantly surprised when I saw they were serving a set, six-course menu.  It gave us a variety of food at a good price ($40 a person).
The decor in this place was fantastic too.  It seems like everything off \"The Strip\" in Vegas is in a strip-mall, including this place.  But the atmosphere inside not cookie-cutter as I half expected. 
The belly dancing show that goes on periodically while you eat, is a good balance of fun, sexy, and family-friendly.  

When all was said and done, the food was delicious, and offered more than we could eat.  The servers were friendly, and happily answered any questions."}
{"text":"Marrakech is one of my all time favorite spots in Las Vegas! They have one set menu, which they have perfected, so you always know what you're going to get and that it will be delicious! It's $50 a person and includes a 6 course meal. Starts with a shrimp appetizer, then soup, followed by a spread plate, then a beef kabob, chicken and cous cous and finished with a delicious dessert and tea. Every course except the chicken and cous cous is eaten with your hands. It is definitely a one of a kind adventure! Leave picky eaters at home and prepare to enjoy a unique culinary delight. They have alcoholic beverages but if you don't drink I recommend ordering their signature mint tea to drink throughout the meal. It pairs well with everything! They do have gluten free and vegan options. Make sure you bring a couple dollars to tip the belly dancer. Love the ambiance here and will continue to return regularly!"}
{"text":"It's a set menu so you don't have options. However, the bad stops there! Despite not having choices about food, it's quite delicious. Oh and the tea... yum. The decor is absolutely amazing and the belly dancers are so fun to watch. This is definitely a hidden gem in Vegas. We come here everytime we're in town."}
{"text":"This is place was a nice break from the strip, we used a Groupon that was basically a 2-4-1 on their Prix Fixe dinner, ordered also a bottle of red wine and enjoyed everything about the place: service, entertainment, food and ambiance.
The best out of all the food was the beef skewer and the dessert, simply amazing.
I would go back if the deal came back, full price? Maybe not, not because of anything negative with the place it's just that Vegas has too many places to try. But I do recommend."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 6PM; the restaurant opens at 530PM. When my partner and I arrived, we were the only ones there. The seating arrangement is lounge-like and is along the perimeter of the room so that the center becomes the \"stage\" for the performances. I could clearly tell that the restaurant entertains group dinners, but the corners have seating for couples if need be.

Foodwise? I never tried Moraccan food, so as an entry eater, I thought the food was great. Authentic? Not sure since it's my first time, but since I enjoyed it,  I would definitely consider finding a local restaurant which serves authentic Moraccan recipes. 

I probably over did it with the bread because I ate it with everything...enough where I couldn't really finish my last two courses. But the bread was so yummy. It's soft in the middle but holds up liquids/sauces well.

Food for thought: It was my anniversary dinner. My guy said, \"Fogo?\" I said, \"For the same price, let's try something different.\" It definitely was different. It was worth going the road less traveled."}
{"text":"First time there. Food was excellent. The atmosphere is very
Different dark creepy like a movie set
. A lot
Of fun. Definitely
Would go back."}
{"text":"Marrakech was a great dining experience, it was so much more than a dinner. The food was excellent, the atmosphere cozy, warm and intimate. The wait staff is friendly, polite and charming. They are graciously accommodating to vegetarians.

First you begin with hand washing in rose water, then the six course meal provides a LOT of food. Utensils are provided if you ask, however this is meant to be a very hands-on experience. Hence the hand-washing ceremony.

I had mushroom scampi due to a shrimp allergy, which was out of this world, and my boyfriend had shrimp. My friend had zucchini scampi however because she doesn't eat shrimp or mushrooms. Hers was equally delicious.

The hummus was excellent and I'm a picky hummus person. The harrira soup was fantastic; I make it at home a lot and loved it. I never knew my recipe at home was so \"on target\".

The kebobs were delicious, even the vegetarian option. The bread is addicting from start to finish. Especially when dipping it into the scampi sauce. Next up was the cous cous with Cornish game hen. By now I was just about full but persevered. It was too great not to.

I had an apricot beer to go with my meal with was a perfect choice.

Then there is dessert, a baklava type  dish with Moroccan tea. Both a pleasure to enjoy.

This was truly a unique experience and one I would recommend to anyone who wants to try something a bit different. This is not a restaurant to go to if you do not like to linger.

The belly dancing is fun and mesmerizing for everyone."}
{"text":"This establishment is one of our favorite places to visit and have shared wonderful memories here! My husband and I have been here for our second date, my 20th birthday, and for a casual night out with friends. It's a great place to go for all sorts of occasions and is especially suited for groups. 

The ambience is fun, upbeat, and appealing if you're into experiencing something new. The belly-dancers who come out intermittently are not shy to try and have you dance along with them. Personally, I've never been brave enough but it's evident to see how much fun those who do dare to participate have.

And the food is SUPERB! We always leave as if we feasted like kings. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-I've had a chance to eat at Marrakech 2x times.
-Both times did not disappoint.
-If you are looking for a fun, comfortable, taste-bud explosion & stomach-stuffing experience, COME HERE.
-The Moroccan cuisine here is absolutely delicious & you are served in a romantic, tent-like setting.
-You start off w/ washing your hands by warm rose water being poured onto your hands in the middle of the table.
-The tea is poured in a very photo-op worthy way (see photo below).
-WARNING:  COME HUNGRY b/c you will be stuffed.
-You eat a set, 6-course menu, which consists of:  
-Mediterranean Shrimp Scampi -  Large, juicy, tangy & succulent.
-Harira (lentil) Soup - Very hot & perfect portion.
-Marrakech Sampler - Baba ganoush, hummus, Moroccan olives, cucumbers, marinated carrots served w/ pita chips (you can ask for more if you run out).
-Beef Brochette (shish kabob) - Excellent presentation atop a pineapple, big, chunky pieces of smoky beef.
-Royal Moroccan Couscous Chicken Platter - If you aren't full by now, you will be!  The chicken quarters are so tender you can almost eat the bones & the couscous just melts in your mouth.
-B'Stilla - Very yummy pastry stuffed w/ bananas, nuts & chocolate.
-Entertainment is provided by some talented belly dancing + you can participate :)

Overall, this is a great place to take a group of family and/or friends.  Very lively, very good Moroccan food."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant many times and everytime we have the time of our lives. Not only do you get great food, the entertainment is just as good. If you'd like a dining experience like no other, Marrakech is a must try."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was good but if you aren't in the mood for the 6 course overload it's not for you as it's basically all they offer.  Very pricey for what it is.  I've had $15 platters at similar restaurants that were just as good. Ambiance was really good though. Service was meh. I was drug here as part of a group. Definitely not a place that should be on your list when visiting Vegas, especially with all the other top notch options around.  Unless you're dying for Moroccan food for some reason I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"In town with some Vegas rookies and took them to Marrakech for a starter point for the rest of the night.  As when the last time we were there, it was a good time.  The food was tasty, drinks were Vegas, and the belly dancers rocked! The wife danced, our guest danced, and i belly danced.  Next time I'm taking those tips."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer here for over 20years.  I absolutely adore everything about this wonderful place: the food, ambiance, music, entertainment, service!  I have some wonderful colorful memories - once a wedding - full bridal party in gowns got up to dance along with the Biker gang in full leathers that were also there - and soon the entire restaurant was on its feet dancing and smiling and enjoying a once in a lifetime experience.  You can dress casual to dressy - Its an environment that makes you look good. Complements all styles. Each time i go there its like a wonderful escape from whatever reason I've come to Vegas - Whether work convention or Partying for days - its an off the beaten path Joy!  As if you go into a Cocoon or Genie's Lamp and come out refreshed, belly full, giggles, and content.  I highly Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Moroccan food I've had since I was in London! I wish I could find something like this in Phoenix. If anyone knows of a great Moroccan place here, pleeeeze let me know. 

Marrakech offers a set menu with several courses. Simply check out the pics one of the reviewers put up (kudos). No menu. Just a server swiftly giving you the run-down of what will be served. I believe the meal is $40/person.  I'm allergic to seafood and couldn't eat the shrimp scampi. They were very cool about substituting. I had sauteed mushrooms in garlic &  herbs. I dipped the peasant bread in the juices and OMG!! The hummus course was so good and so smooth that I literally want to hop on a plane right now just for a repeat! 

By the 4th course I was stuffed, but the food was so damn good that I just kept going and going! This is one of those places the locals go. So I knew it would be great. Oh, and fellas, the belly dancers are awesome too!

Oh, and ask for Leo (server)!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with great food and entertainment!  The sautéed mushrooms and shrimps, filet kabobs, hummus and dessert are awesome!  Great Moroccan wines!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The ambience, the food, the service was all really great. Barely waited to get seated. 

We got the prix fixe as part of a Groupon. Would definitely recommend and think it's worth the normal price as well. Everything we had was pretty good, especially the meat dishes. The only thing I didnt think was THAT great was the soup. 

I was a bit upset that we didnt get the mint tea in the end, but other than that, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This review is beyond overdue, but I wanted to write it anyway. This is an AMAZING place. My husband and I got married in Vegas, and this is where we had our reception. The price was more than reasonable for what we got. In addition, Ali did some extra things for us when it came to getting some specific beers etc. If we did it all over again, I would have done the reception exactly as it was. We have wonderful memories of our special day!

I truly hope we get back here again. I also recommend anyone looking into this wonderful place for a reception or a party. You really can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Ever since my Moroccan feast during a holiday party at a Moroccan restaurant in Atlanta several years ago, I've wanted to revisit the experience.  This visit was a pleasant end to my two-week birthday vacation.  

The six-course Moroccan feast is a prixe fixe menu consisting of:

1. Moroccan Style Lamb Sausage with onions and tomatoes (shellfish substitute)
2. Harira Soup (Lentil, rice, lemon, and spices)
3. Marrakech Sampler (Hummus (garbanzo/tahini dip), Baba ghannouj (eggplant/tahini dip), Moroccan style olives, cucumbers, beets, and carrots)
4. Beef Brochette (Beef kabob - marinated and grilled)
5. Royal Moroccan CousCous platter with Djaj (Chicken, assorted vegetables including butternut squash and cabbage)
6. B'stilla (Moroccan pastry stuffed with fruits and nuts topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon, and served with traditional mint tea.)

Homemade Moroccan bread is served with each course.

To drink, I had the Marrakech Mojito (Bacardi muddled with fresh mint, lime & sugar, topped with a splash of soda and a hint of rose water)."}
{"text":"Last night my very agreeable boyfriend took me to this Moroccan/ middle eastern restaurant for dinner. He obliged me this dinner and I'm so glad he did!! 
It is a six course meal that is already set for you. The meal was something like, shrimp scampi, hummus and veggies, soup, beef kabob, Cornish game hen on top of yummy cous cous and then an apple filo thing. 
It was yummy, filling, it didn't BLOW ME AWAY...but it was fun and romantic and yummy and I will defiantly go back when I feel like sipping mint tea and eating some middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat for this dinner and exotic dancing show for $45/person.  The waiter kindly suggested we only order 2 feasts so our son ate our portions which were very generous.  The meal was pre-set...no ordering of main dishes.  First was large prawns in a white wine, butter, garlic, lemon broth with a huge thinly-sliced loaf of bread.  We dipped with delight and polished of the generous prawns.  Next came a rich Hummus and Eggplant dip. The Hummus had lots of Tahini so it was decadent.  The eggplant dip was similar to Babaganoush but more smokey-flavored and otherwise lightly spiced.  Large lemony pickled cucumbers and sweet pickled carrots along with a small selection of Mediterranean olives were very fresh accompanied the dips well.  Unfortunately one was not quite pitted all the way and I nearly broke my upper back molar. Please be careful when eating these.  There was filling, flavorful lentil soup too.

Next were two large tender kabobs of Filet Mignon steak cubes.  Now after all this we got a huge plate of couscous and (chicken?) on top.  The meat could have been another poultry as there were thinner bones than usual.  It was tasty but we were almost too full already.  A very large phyllo-pastry filled with dates, bananas, nuts with chocolate sauce drizzled on top was also included for desert.  We also ordered traditional Moroccan mint tea for $10 at the start of the meal.  The waiters, who were gracious and relaxed poured it several feet above the glasses to aerate it and then filled the pot for us at least 6 times.  It was very sweet and strong of mint flavor.  I would highly recommend ordering this to compliment your meal.  

Lastly the dancer was Acadia and she was an amazing belly dancer who could undulate her belly and shimmy her entire body simultaneously.  She was sweet and has been dancing here for years.  She allowed my son to dance with her and we got great pictures for his Instagram.  I wish I had brought a $20 just for her but I did add it to my tip and asked the waiters if they would give that portion to her.  This is an exceptional restaurant.  Well worth the price with high quality food.  You will not leave hungry and you can't help but enjoy yourself in the laid-back, darkened and romantic setting with the high quality food, exotic belly dancing and high class waiter service.  My only complaint was that the owner had a table of friends or relatives and spent the 2 hours lavishing attention on them but ignoring his other tables.  Oh well, our waiters made up for this and we still loved it."}
{"text":"A really REALLY unique experience.

The place is $35-$40 per person, preset menu. It's a 7 course menu.

From the outside the building doesn't look like much, but inside, WOW. It's like you're inside a genie lamp

This restaurant is more of a one time type of deal I felt.

I would definitely recommend, but I don't think i'll go back here on a regular basis. To show friends from out of town this is great, but on a regular basis, I just don't know.

That said, everything about the place was great. Food was good, service was great, belly dancers provided some entertainment.

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Marrakech for over 15 years and it's my all-time favorite restaurant. Never miss it when I'm in Vegas.  I love the atmosphere, it feels like you're dining in a tent in Morocco. They used to have pillows for sitting on the floor, which I really miss, but everything else has remained the perfectly the same. The belly dancers, especially Aradia Wynn, are FABULOUS! Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I organized a group of 21 people for a Night Circus-themed birthday party. The reservation process was a cinch, and the entire staff (but especially Abdul) were incredibly patient with our highly disorganized group. 

The setting itself is warm and felt very intimate--it was like we had the place to ourselves, even though we were a small fraction of the actual space. The dancers were good and all too happy to let us dance with them. The noise level was not too loud for us to talk freely. 

They accommodated a range of dietary needs (vegetarians, gluten-free, etc) with grace, and called us 5 cabs when we were ready to go. I would definitely recommend Marrakech for a large group and/or festive event. I looked at a LOT of places before deciding on Marrakech, and it's a decision I'd happily make again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I flew in from LA to have dinner last night. I  Love, Love, Love to food and the atmosphere! The shrimp scampi is AWESOME and the chicken was so tender, juicy, and absolutely flavorful. I will be making another trip to Vegas really soon ;)!!"}
{"text":"Oh boy oh boy, how do I start?

The restaurant starts with a prixe fixe menu 6 courses, the decor of the restaurant makes you feel as if you've been transported to a new world.

They start with washing your hands as soon as you're seated. 

We had a great shrimp scampi (probably the best part of the meal), a harira veggie based soup, some kabobs (also very good), marrakech sampler (best hummus ever!), could've done without the mushy chicken, and the b'stilla was pretty smushy too...

the server was so nice and courteous 

the belly dancer was so cute :) 

the experience is out of this world highly recommend for a romantic date night"}
{"text":"Yes it's not cheap but about forty-five per person, you'll be very content with the off-the-Strip feeling of this restaurant. 

I organized a bachelor's party dinner here and everybody was happy. The dancers could shake, and my tummy was happy.

Even though I was full, I couldn't stop eating the dessert; a flaky nutella-like chocolate, banana filled concoction that rocked my tongue's world.

And after dinner, move your BP to the cigar bar in the same plaza!!"}
{"text":"First time for me for morrocan food.. This place was so cute! Food was hot and delicious.. Their dessert was to die for and the chicken stew and kabob were so filling.."}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool dining experience.  

As we were planning our trip to Sin City, I perused Groupon and found this great deal.  The BFF's agreed, and the Groupon was bought.

The dining room is wrapped in a cloth and decorated in traditional Moroccan style.  The feel is like you are in a warm happy place.  You sit on low benches, or little stools...so ladies, I might bypass the short dresses here.  Unless you are not shy,  The servers were great, taking us in nearly an hour before our reservation time.  we thought there would be a bar we could sit at, but there was not.

With the Groupon, we had the 6 course meal, which was DELICIOUS!!  Every course that came out was made to perfection and in just the right proportions.  My favorites were the shrimp and lemon garlic sauce.  The bread dipped in the drippings were scrumptious.  And the Beef Kabobs were perfect.  For a nice touch, with desert came a delicious mint tea that just ended the meal on the right note.

The Belly dancer was pretty cool.  She was amazing, and everyone had a great time!  She moved through the room gracefully, and encouraged people to get up and dance with here.  The music they played was perfect, and just loud enough where you felt like you wanted to get up and dance, but could still carry on a conversation with your friends.

Cab fare from the strip, and back, was about $30 total.

It is a pricey place if you don't have the Groupon.  I am not sure I would have come if I had to pay the full price for 4 people.  But I am glad we made it in...I have not seen anything like this place in all of my dining outs."}
{"text":"MORROCAN FOOD straight feastin'! ;D

For $49.99 it was a full on 6 course fixed meal with belly dancers performing.

6 Course Meal: 
-1. *Mediterranean Shrimp Scampi*: sauteed with lemon, wine and garlic.. gave the shrimp incredible flavors and was awesome for dipping the bread into the sauce 
-2. *Harira Soup*: (Lentil, rice, lemon, & spices)- was good 
-3. *Marrakech Sampler*-Hummus (garbanzo/ tahini dip), Baba Ghannouj (eggplant/ tahini dip), Moroccan olives, cucumbers & marinated carrots: awesome  hummus, and carrots were too pickled for my taste
-4. *Beef Brochette* (Kabob)- stabbed in a pineapple, these grilled beef steak kabobs were tender &  delicious! excellent presentation and flavor ;]
-5. *Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj* (Chicken)- this came with variety of veggies, my favorite was the butternut squash in the mix and the chicken was juicy and delightful.. I was too full to eat a lot of it, but did taste it's goodness, MmMmm
-6. *B'stilla* (classic Moroccan pastry stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea).. great dessert reminds me of a filled crepe and tasted light and fluffy 

Ah this place is super expensive, but lots of fun!! With never ending food coming out, come here hungry and ready to grub! I'd recommend this for a change up from a typical dinner or maybe for a special occasion/celebration. They also have a full bar, specialty cocktails, beer, and wine. 

They had 2 belly dancers the night I came: one thicker belly dancer and the second belly dancer was more slender and fit. Both were great and friendly which added for great entertainment with their music, decor, ambiance, and dinner crowds. 

With my group that night it came to about $100 per person for food, drinks, and gratuity. 

4 Stars for this exotic restaurant in Las Vegas.~ :)"}
{"text":"Oh My God - Such a great experience. Everything from the company, to the food, to the ambiance, to the entertainment was amazing. 

First of all it's off the strip, so you don't have that crazy rush of people coming in and out of the place. It's sort of refreshing, after being surrounded by people 24/7. The place is pretty small, you can probably fit about 50 people in the whole place. So make sure you make a reservation, if you want to get seated right away.

Once you walk in you will notice the great decor. Beautiful bold colors all over the the restaurant, its literally covered top to bottom. The tables/seats are covered in plush cushions, which make you never want to get up from the table.

As far as the food is concerned, everything is on a set menu. It's six courses, the first being shrimp scampi, the second being a tomato based soup, the third being hummus and vegetable platter, the fourth being beef kabobs, the fifth being chicken and couscous, and the sixth and last being a fruit, powdered sugar, filo dough dessert. Everything was family style and amazing. Oh and they really don't give you any silverware, so you have to eat with your hands, good thing they wash your hands with rose water before hand. I really can't tell you which of the six dishes was my favorite, everything had a unique delicious taste. 

The other great thing about this restaurant was the entertainment. Every 15 minutes or so a belly dancer would come and dance about two or three songs. The girls are beautiful and it's amazing how they move their bodies. They also interact with the crowd, they encourage people to come up and dance with them. When I was there some of the crowd was getting too happy - they were making it rain on the belly dancers - throwing lots and lots of dollar bills at them. 

I can't wait to come back again. I will have to take some belly dancing classes before hand, that way I can dance with the best of them!"}
{"text":"Who knew they had a traditional style Moroccan restaurant hidden outside the sparkly strips of Vegas?

Welcome to Marrakech.

For just $40 you receive a traditional six course meal that leaves you absolutely stuffed while watching beautiful belly dancers mesmerize you with their vibrating hips. Seriously, what muscles do these girls have that I don't?! Sugar honey iced tea.

So I'm going to give you a disclaimer for the meal that I wish had been there for me to see when I had dined there this Saturday: do NOT have a 6 course meal if you plan on going clubbing later that evening. Just don't do it. Why? Well, after 6 delicious courses you will have no other desire but to curl up into a ball and slip into the inevitable food coma. Nothing else. No really, nothing else. 

That being said, the fare at Marrakech was heavenly. Here's a detailed course by course recap of our FEAST:

1st Course - Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi (sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic): I could not get enough of this dish. We were given two plates of shrimp for the four of us and it was such a great serving. I could not get enough of the sauce and kept dipping my bread in it to munch on. I knew I  was a goner once half of my loaf was already in my belly at after this course.

2nd Course - Harira Soup (lentil, rice, lemon and spices): I usually dislike lentils but I really enjoyed their version of this dish. The flavor of the lentils did not overpower the other flavors and I really appreciated the tomato-lemon essence. True it was probably 90 something degrees outside but I really did enjoy that hot cup of soup!

3rd Course - Moroccan Sampler (hummus, zaaluk, Moroccan style olives, beets & carrots): Wow that was definitely homemade hummus. Wonderfully fresh with a hint of smokiness. We were given even MORE bread at this point (i.e. warm pita) to mop this up with. The zaaluk (eggplant tomato dip) was to die for as well.

4th Course - Beef Brochette (marinated beef kabobs): Beef skewers served on a whole pineapple. Unfortunately I dropped two pieces of my kabob like a child but I really enjoyed my meat. It was a tad chewy but great seasoning.

**Please note that by this course you should make sure that you have car arrangements figured out once you receive this entree otherwise you might be screwed FYI.**

5th Course - Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken (served the traditional way with heaps of vegetables including squash and cabbage): At this point we were totally dying. I think I had 4 bites of this dish and had to call it quits from fear of exploding. The chicken was tender and literally fell off the bone and the couscous were fluffy perfection. Our poor waiter thought we didn't like the food but we reassured him that we did. 

6th Course - B'Stilla (classic pastry filled with bananas, walnuts and chocolate covered with powdered sugar served with Moroccan mint tea): Basically this was a warm, flaky puff pastry filled with all of the above. 

The voluptuous belly dancers entertained us about every half hour during our meal which was a great distraction from our constant noshing.


Overall Marakech was a fantastic and AFFORDABLE dining experience in Las Vegas. Now I will reiterate that the food was great.. but the reason why this restaurant received 5 stars instead of 4 was because the amazing owner drove me and the rest of our party to the Palms after waiting outside his restaurant for an hour for a cab. He took pity on us and offered us the ride since we were sweet (unlike the other see you next Tuesdays that were also outside). What a gentleman! 

Plus, he's hot. Great combo ladies."}
{"text":"I don't have much experience with Moroccan food but it is often mentioned in Las Vegas that if you want to try Moroccan cuisine, the best place to go is Marrakesh. The restaurant is close to the Las Vegas strip and in the same plaza as the infamous Spanish tappas restaurant, Firefly.

The inside of the restaurant is decorated elaborately and feels like a real life set of Aladdin. If half of a restaurant is made by its ambiance, then Marrakesh has it nailed. After you are seated around a circular table, a service staff member comes by with a bowl and a pot of rose scented water, and you are asked to cleanse your hands.

The two items worth noting were the Moroccan style shrimp scampi which comes out as the first course and the beef brochette which comes out on skewers (essentially a kabob) planted in a pineapple. The Moroccan bread which is served like a bread basket throughout the entire dining experience was actually one of the highlights.

The lemon herb chicken accompanied with cous cous as the main course was actually a bit of a disappointment. The cous cous seemed bland and the chicken equally under seasoned. The dessert, which was amazing on the first bite, seeemed disastrously sweet on the second, and almost inedible by the third.  

Another part of the dining experience at Marrakesh was the live belly dancing show and the loud Moraccan music that is piped overhead. While the show and the music was enjoyable at first. It became more of a nuisance to anyone that was trying to have a conversation over dinner. This isn't a restaurant you would take a friend you want to catch up with.

This restaurant seems ideal for partying with a large group. The food was decent, and the atmosphere enjoyable the first 30 minutes. I'm not sure if the entire dinner was worth the 40 dollars. Service was timely and impeccable."}
{"text":"Came here with friends who have never had Moroccan food. To such newbies, this restaurant will be satisfying. To those like me who know this food, they will find Marrakech has food that tastes fine but is not authentic, service that is below average and all at a fairly high cost. The atmosphere with belly dancers is always fun, but even they lacked authenticity and looked like people that had just finished an intermediate course. Overall, this place is just average at a steep price (the bill for 3 with minimal drinks was $240 including tip)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! It was not busy when we were there only 2 other tables.
The decor definitely puts you in the Moroccan mood.
Belly Dancers were beautiful one had more skills than the other, overall they were fine.
One person that was with us is 1/2 Moroccan, speaks the language and has visited often. He asked our waiter if he was also Moroccan and he said yes and walked away. 
I feel that the waiter could have made our experience fun and engaging. We felt as though we were bothering him and he wasn't even busy.
With a 40.00 tip our ticket for 4 adults was $274.00. For this kind of cash I expected more."}
{"text":"One of the best parts of our trip. We were a party of 8 and were treated like royalty. The food was incredible and the portions were huge.  We are really happy we tried and had a fabulous time."}
{"text":"Delicious 6 course meal, awesome vibe and beautiful belly-dancing to match. Tip: Don't eat too much of the bread on the first course or else you will be stuffed my by course 3 :)"}
{"text":"By far my new favorite restaurant! BY FAR! The food was amazing, I like the fact that it's prefixed because I tried things I wouldn't normally have ordered before & I loved all of it! There wasn't one thing that I didn't like! Highly recommend for big parties or groups even though I went with just one other person and it was still a blast. We had tons of leftovers though so make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"I cannot rave about this restaurant or their staff enough! 

Tariq (the owner) was amazing at helping me set up a destination wedding dinner at his restaurant this past April. We rented the entire restaurant for a few hours and I can tell you we had a blast!! The servers were very quick and attentive, food was hot and delicious and the belly dancers were fantastic! 

I could have not asked for a better wedding reception dinner or a better person to help me plan a very special dinner. Thanks again Tariq, my husband and I will be back each time we make it to Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Friday night in vegas with no prior dinner plans can be a pain in the you know what.  Every damn place had a wait that was a hour longer then it should be.  Marrakech is an unsuspecting nondescript store front in a shopping mall just off the strip.  It's neighbors include Ruth Chris steakhouse and some tapas place.  When you walk in you are stepping into a room with floor to ceiling carpetting and guys in mc hammer pant like costumes.  It's a pretty cool and intimate setting.  You sit on little couches and eat food with your hands.  The meal was good and portions were generous.   Later on a belly dancer came out.  It was definitely an unusual and fun part of our vacation!"}
{"text":"Marrakech was a both a great and disappointing experience.

Visited her with my Morrocon friend, and opted for the 6 course prix fixe meal for $50. 

The venue was great, the ambiance was nice and super authentic. We got to wash our hands, eat with our hands and try some cool dishes.

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the ambiance itself. 

The starter shrimps were okay, and my friend noted that they weren't authentic at all. 

The second dish was the lentil soup, which was a mix of lentil, rice, chickpeas, and tomatoes. We enjoyed the soup.

The third dish was the Morrocon salad which came with cooked carrots, hummus, babaganous, and cucumbers. Surprisingly, the carrots were amazing, the dips were nice, and the cucumbers were... Cucumbers.

The fourth dish was the beef skewers. Their presentation was beautiful as they came skewered into a whole pineapple. I really enjoyed the skewer, made me want more!

The fifth dish was the couscous with chicken. This dish was absolutely horrendous, both me and my friend took two bites and let the entire plate go to waste. One of her favourite meals is couscous and she was really looking forward to this dish, unfortunately it was a disaster and not authentic at all.

The sixth and final dish wad the dessert with tea. The tea was fantastic but the dessert was awful. Banana completely overwhelmed my taste buds so we took two bites and let it all go to waste.

There was also a belly dancer which came out periodically. I find belly dancers really awkward, especially when I'm at dinner. However, it's Vegas, so other people seemed to really be enjoying it.

Overall this was a good one time experience, but I would never want to come back again as more than half the food sucked. I'm surprised this place is rated so high, I'm assuming it's the experience as oppose to the food that people enjoy."}
{"text":"I went here in April.  This restaurant is not on the strip, but fortunately we had a car and could drive there.   Earlier in the day we had been online trying to figure out where to eat that night.  There are so many places to choose from in Vegas as you all know.  We wanted to try something different from anything we've tried before.  This fit the bill.  

We were greeted by the owner, he appears to greet all incoming customers and were promptly seated. I liked the ambiance because I've never been to a place like this. It seems like you are sitting in a large tent and the decor goes well with the food.  The service here was excellent, very friendly and prompt.   I thought the food was very good, but I think the prices were high and your only choice on the menu is the multi course meal.  It may be beneficial for them to add items to the menu where you don't have to get the multi course meal, so that people will come back more often and have more choices.  

The shrimp was very good, as well as the hummus, soup and kebobs. By the time we got to the main entree I was stuffed and felt bad that I couldn't eat much of it although I did like it.  The meat in the main entree was very tender.  Somehow I managed to eat the dessert which was very light.  I can never pass up dessert.

The dancers were very good, although for whatever reason it made me feel uncomfortable when they were dancing at our table."}
{"text":"Marrakech is an excellent venue if you're looking for a set price, great for large groups and adds that extra spice with it's authentic Moroccan decor. 

It's as if you're transported directly to Morocco as the host leads you through the draped red velvet curtains into the restaurant. Fabric as far as the eye can see, cozy couches, plush benches and intimate little seating areas serve as this restaurant's dining space. It feels as though you've stepped into a Moroccan themed living room. 

Side note: The ladies restroom is almost as big as my apartment (ha), complete with table and chair (as if sitting on the toilet is not relaxing enough, perhaps a waiting area for potential \"drop off\"? Ha ha, not sure). 

Upon arrival, your server may or may not see the urgency in taking your order right away, I've had two sets of experiences with the staff there. Once you place your beverage order, the feeding frenzy commences! 

The food is a 6 course set menu with a vegetarian option (in which I thoroughly enjoyed). First you will have to cleanse your hands in a table side experience where the server pours rose water over all hands dining at the table (not sure how \"clean\" rose water actually gets your hands, but they smell delightful after wards!). 

Shrimp scampi (or garlic mushrooms), soup, bread, bread, and more bread. Kabobs, chicken with veggies and what I like to call Moroccan \"rice/pasta\", cous cous, and some powdered sugar drenched pastry for desert accompanied by a super SWEET tea. 

All in all the experience is fantastic, hot belly dancers, great variety of Moroccan music, decent service, and tasty eats. 

Bring a date or bring a group, the set menu and fixed price definitely is a plus. (Cash a bond or liquidate your assets for the drink menu though.. yikes!)"}
{"text":"We first discovered Marrakech when my dance troupe attended the Belly Dance Intensive a few years ago. Every year we've gone to Vegas we've gone to Marrakech because it's such an awesome place to go to with a bunch of friends.
The minute you walk in the door you're transported to another part of the world; the low tables, dim lighting, variety of benches and poufs, Moroccan lanterns. The ambience is amazing.
The food is superb...and there's a lot of it... even 8 of us couldn't finish it all off. The servers give you plenty of time between the different courses so you can sit and chat and enjoy the fabulous dancers (and yes, the dancers ARE fabulous-- their technique is perfect). 
I've only been here with a large group, but looking around this would be the perfect romantic date spot. 
I'll also say that the mint tea at the end of the meal is superb. I'm not a huge tea drinker and I mostly dislike mint, but somehow I love this tea."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Great little date night spot. Atmosphere is authentic, food is delish and service is on point... Love all the little touches that this restaurant does, esp the rose water!! See you soon!"}
{"text":"A very cool experience!

We had the six course dinner, and although pricey, it was very good. They were extremely careful about my allergy and even brought me my own plate for the salad and bread since the hummus had sesame in it, and the homemade bread had sesame.

Loved the eggplant stuff, whatever it was, and the belly dancers were really fascinating to watch!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. Service was great we had fun it's a cool place belly dancing and all. The in laws loved it you can't miss if you're bring them. Safest bet for your girls side of family."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! If I could give it more stars I would! My best friend took me here for my birthday last night and it was my first time going. I've heard great things about this place so I was excited to come here! Well it completely surpassed any and all expectations! The food was AMAZING! The shrimp was so good! I almost asked for more! The meat kabobs were so tender! I usually don't like meat because sometimes their too chewy, but it just melted in your mouth! I had never tried couscous and I must say I'm glad that my first time trying it was here because it was sooooo fluffy and the chicken literally fell off the bone! AND THE DESSERT! OMG!! probably the best thing I've ever tasted! At this point I was stuffed beyond belief but when the dessert came out I could not help myself! It's a Nutella/chocolate banana filled filo dough pastry baked and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon along with a hot tea! Perfect way to end a delicious meal! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here Thursday night before a concert. We did the six course feast. It's definetly  a feast!! By Course three I was stuffed!! Don't eat too much bread. And the desert is absolutely delicious too!!! My favorite was the mint tea at the end. I was so stuffed I could hardly move, but after a few cups of this delicious tea I was feeling much better!! Thinking about having my work holiday party here this year!"}
{"text":"Go for the whole experience, and bring someone worthy of sharing it with you.  The food is very good - but the atmosphere is one of a kind.

  I've been to Marrakech twice now, not many restaurants have blown me away on first impression the way this place has.  You won't forget your first time here.  The second time, the magic wasn't quite there, however still good, so maybe its a place to go once for a date, but not necessarily often or repeatedly, especially considering the food selection is planned for you and it's always the same.

  FOOD:  The 6 course meal includes a shrimp scampi, a kind of lentil soup, a sampler including humus, dips, olives, and veggies, beef kabobs, a chicken platter, a Moroccan dessert, and hot tea to drink. (There is also an option for vegetarians)
  All of the food was pretty solid, the shrimp, beef, and humus sampler were my favorites, all 4/5's.  And although the food will not disappoint you, what's going on around you is where Marrakech really kills it...

  ATMOSPHERE:  It looks like you're eating in a tent, sitting on low comfortable couch seats, with interesting wall hangings around you, and loud middle-eastern music playing.  Warm, refreshing towels are  used to wash your hands.  A beautiful belly-dancer comes out and really puts on a show.  She made my date blush because we were trying to tip her but she wouldn't stop gyrating her hips, so she couldn't get the bills in her waste band.  Silverware is optional but they recommend you use your grubby little digits to feed your face.

  BOTTOM LINE:  The place is crazy authentic.  Admittedly I've never been to Morocco, so I wouldn't know.  Okay, so I've never eaten at another Moroccan restaurant.  Whatever.  The point is that this is what I would think is totally authentic, and it was really really really cool.  I recommend it highly to anyone out there who hasn't yet made this trip, you are totally missing out on a very unique and entertaining experience.

  NOTES:  On one occasion the owner was there and was genuinely concerned about what we thought.  It turned out we both grew up in NJ, so I totally Facebook added him.  He seems to check in there often.  Super, super nice guy.
  Also, as others have mentioned, there are Groupon discounts available from time to time, so grab that bad boy up if you see it selling.

5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I didn't eat all day in preparation for the 6 course meal and let me say that we still took leftovers home. So COME HUNGRY! Marrakech is fantastic! From the moment we arrived we were treated royally. Every course is timed perfectly to entice and cleanse the palate. The richness of each savory course is definitely fit for a king. The music, and ambiance is upbeat and sexy, which will undoubtedly make you want to gyrate alongside the belly dancer. The drinks are well worth it it here as they are STRONG! I loved this experience. It's definitely worth exploring, but be advised that finding a cab after is a bit tedious. The restaurant called a cab for us. Allow about 15 minutes for them to arrive, otherwise enjoy Marrakech for all its worldly wonder."}
{"text":"Great experience if you're in the mood for something different.  Fun for teens and adults!  Good food and entertainment...great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is truly authentic. The experience is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The food was great. The dancer was amazing. The wait staff friendly. The music divine. The owner amiable. Everything was perfect here. My only complaint would be the price which without a Groupon would be much to pricy to frequent too often. Go here for the experience of a lifetime"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! The ambiance is amazing and the food is even better."}

{"text":"On to my next dinner.

All of the courses were just OK. It's a $45 fixed menu, and they were prompt in their service.

The one benefit of eating here over other Mediterranean restaurants is the belly dancers that come out every so often. I only got to see one, but she was extremely talented.

Visit here for the experience, not necessarily the food."}
{"text":"Marrakech is a fun place for a nice dinner out.  Good for a twosome or a group, I've never been disappointed.

The menu is a set six course meal, so you don't get your choice of what you want, but it's all yumtastic.  A shrimp plate gives way to a barley soup, then a plate of stuffed grape leaves and hummus, half a game hen, lamb kabobs in pineapple and an apple dessert that satisfies.  It's all fantastic.

The interior is fantastic - rich rugs and draperies line the walls and ceilings, and seating is on the floor with pillows.  The service can take a while, but the entire experience is fun so I never minded.  Bellydancers swirl about and our server poured tea from shoulder height into a cup balanced on his toe.  Bravo, dude."}
{"text":"This place rolled out the red carpet. The owner Tarek greeted us on arrival and we had a blast. Food was great and the dancing was insane."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience, a great place with the wife, daughter, son in law and my precious granddaughter. First time in Moroccan restaurant and was great"}
{"text":"Dinner on Saturday, 1/16/16 (first time visiting)

This restaurant is located in a small plaza so parking can be tough. The ambiance seemed casual with very dim lighting and loud music. You'll get right into the feel of the atmosphere with belly dancers around the restaurant.

We came with a group of friends so they ordered for us. A variety of dishes were served one at a time while we sat on a couch with a lower table, like a coffee table. We started off with an appetizer that included hummus, olives, and dipping sauces. The main dishes were tasty but I don't know the names of them. We had vegetables mixed together and also meat skewers served vertically on a plate. When all the courses have been served, we were pretty full. The dessert was something I've never had before. It tastes like bananas and chocolate between crispy flakes but looked like a round cake. We were too full to finish it so we took it to go.

My first time visiting a restaurant with this type of atmosphere and food so I'm not sure how the food should taste, but I enjoyed it. Other parties seemed to enjoy it a lot too because the belly dancers welcome you to dance with them and photography is allowed."}
{"text":"My husband made Valentine's Day reservation through yelp and Marrakech did not disappoint. The servers begin your meal by rinsing your hands in rose water. We decided to order the six course meal. Every dish was exotic and delicious even their Moroccan tea was tasteful. Our dinner lasted about two hours and between meals we saw the belly dancers perform three times. The dancers were enthusiastic and energetic throughout their performance. I will definitely be coming back. I recommend Marrakech for couples on a date."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight with my sister. We went hungry and still couldn't finish our meal! The  six courses were all delicious with the shrimp scampi being out favorite. We had the house wine  ( chardonnay and pinot noir) and both were good. I didn't love the hummus but everything else was good. There were two belly dancers that came out twice each during our dinner. Be prepared....they might ask you to dance!"}
{"text":"We felt like royalty at Marrakech!  I took my fiancee here for our first anniversary as part of a full day of activities in Las Vegas.  After driving from Los Angeles, seeing a show, and wandering around, this was the kicker at the end of the night...and it didn't disappoint.

Marrakech is a very unassuming restaurant from the outside.  It looks like a regular hole in the wall joint, with nothing spectacular going on inside.  This is where this facade ends.  Once we stepped in, we felt as if we'd been transported to a distant land, where the royalty had lavish tents filled with food, drink, and debauchery.  The interior had a beautiful, and romantic appeal which seduced us with beauty, aroma, and ambiance.  We were lead to our section of the \"tent\" and began our meal.  It was explained to us that the menu is prix fixe, and if we had any preferences (vegetarian) to let them know.  We did not, so they began to serve us.

Before the meal started, they washed our hands in rose water over a beautifully elaborate bowl, and we knew that we were in for a treat.  Next, they began to bring out the food.  Each dish was extravagant, and each dish progressively tasted better and better.  We were wowed by the presentation of the dishes, and the flavors exceeded even the visual appeal of the beautifully prepared dishes.

Just when we thought we were done, they brought out the dancers.  Now this was a year into our relationship, so I began to avert my eyes from the dancers, and enjoy the company with whom I was spending my time.  My fiancee, however, thought it would be a good idea to make me dance with the dancer.  I obliged, and after an embarrassing (but fun) dance, I was affirmed of the excellence of this place.

We have tried looking around for somewhere similar in our area, but have yet to try something, since this was one of the best dining experiences we had.  We have never found Moroccan food to even come close."}
{"text":"We go every year for our Christmas party and have a blast!!! No one will ever leave hungry! The food is phenomenal and the service is excellent! The atmosphere is fun and very entertaining!! I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very intimate setting with a wonderful atmosphere. Very dimly lit inside with music playing and dancers walking around the restaurant. The food is amazing as well. All I can say is come hungry. The dinner is more of a prix fixe menu that comes in multiple course but I didn't have one bad dish while I was there. The tea at the end really helped with my food coma. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"A hidden place in a strip mall 2 blocks from the strip. Very friendly, good service. Atmosphere and lighting is relaxing, good seating. I ordered an old fashioned and pleasantly surprised that it was made correctly. You start off with having a hand wash with rose water. The six courses come out perfectly timed. A fresh loaf of bread with shrimp scampi was excellent, soup, vegetable, hummus, babaganoush, kabobs, chicken and cous-cous followed by pastry dessert and tea.   Very good overall , I would give 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Went here with my gf & had a good time. The owner likes to get involved with the customers to make sure they are enjoying themselves. The ambiance makes you forget that you are in Vegas. The food & entertainment go hand & hand. Overall, a great date night! Ty"}
{"text":"This was definitely a fun and different dining experience. It wasn't the best atmosphere to catch up with friends since the music was so loud, but it was exciting and exotic. Every hour or so a belly dancer would come out and dance around the room which was fun. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small. The room was lined with small little table and stools. So I wouldn't really recommend it for very large groups. 

Food: We had to order their 6 course dinner and the only substitue we could have made was for vegetarian options. We had a party of 6 ppl and 4 portions was more than enough food to feed all of us. So pretty much you ate what they brought out and didn't have much choice, but luckily the food was pretty good. I would have to say that all the food was very flavorful and very fresh.

Overall: the dinners were a little pricey. I would say about $60 per couple. But the food was pretty memorable and scrumpous. 
Environment: a little too loud for my liking, but music and entertainment was nice."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, and the belly dancers were great as well! Can't believe it took me soo long to come here! I am vegan and they catered to my needs without any hesitation!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a strange evening. 

We took advantage of the 6 course meal. The first four dishes were amazing. They came out quickly and were quite tasty.  We had totally overlooked the fact that our waiter never smiled and had no personality.  We were having a great time. 

The meal started with some fresh baked bread.  The bread was great, even better when dipped into the fourth course, the hummus.  Naturally when the waiter came over to clear the hummus we told him to leave it. There was plenty of bread and hummus left for dipping. 

We were having a very nice time, laughing and enjoying the belly dancing. Then we started to notice that the food stopped coming.  It had been 20 minutes since the waiter stopped by. We joked: \"maybe we should have let him take the hummus!\". 

10 more minutes passed as we tried to get the waiter's attention. We finally decided to chug our waters so the water boy would come over. \"He could get us our waiter,\" we thought...

We had now been waiting 40 minutes for the chicken to come.  The water boy came over almost immediatly as we finished chugging. We asked if he knew if our chicken was ever coming...He told us he'd go find out.

Shortly thereafter the waiter came over and said \"oh, are you done with this?\" referring to the hummus. We really would have continued to dip, but feared we would never see the chicken if we did. We let it go and a few moments later we got our bland chicken. 

The moral of the story: DON'T KEEP THE HUMMUS!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been wanting to try this place for years, so when the groupon came up & thought it would be perfect to try it out. Upon entering, we were seated in an old room that may have been cool back in the 90's but not so much anymore. The first course was shrimp scampi, not bad but not impressive. Second course was the bowl of soup that tasted like progresso, then the hummus platter that was ok. Then the steak skewers that weren't bad but again not anything great. Lastly the chicken & cous cous. This isn't Moroccan food. 

The other strange thing was the belly dancer was Asian, aren't we at a Moroccan restaurant? Don't get me wrong, she was good. 

For 4 people to dine, with the $65 off for the groupon it still was $102. I'm sorry but it definitely was not worth it. Way better Mediterranean food at Paymons. Lastly the service was lacking, I sat for 20 minutes with an empty water glass, and the place was not busy. Save your $ go somewhere else.

Fake Moroccan restaurant. Owners are Lebanese."}

{"text":"This place is outstanding. The decor and entertainment of the restaurant is amazing. This is a great date place or good for a group, they have a few small tables as well as large ones for groups. This is a great place to start your night off at when you really wanna make the most of it. I can't wait to go back! It is on the expensive side but from my point of view your getting entertainment as well as a great meal!"}
{"text":"Every single thing (from the mint tea to the desert) was delicious.  Coming from a family of excellent Mediterranean cooking...........I can't complain about this place."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for my friends bday! The service was great and the food was pretty good, plus the belly dancing was pretty cool ! The drinks not so much, I had the pomegranate mojito, let's just say it tasted like simple syrup I had to return it. Although the food was good, I don't feel like it was super authentic. I didn't know shrimp scampi was Moroccan, well that's because it's not! Haha then I asked for cheese and they didn't have any,  if your going to serve an Italian dish have some cheese. 

But as I said the food was pretty good, just nothing special. I wish that with  with our 6 course meal, that rice was served, and a better variation of meats. I don't know if I would return, this place was just whatever food wise for me."}
{"text":"Wow. As I perused the reviews of this place, I was surprised to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews. While I really liked the ambience of the place (reminds me of Babouch in San Pedro, CA), the food was just average. I can say this because, yes, I've been to Morocco and had authentic food (cooked at a home, not a restaurant).

For what we paid per person--some 50.00 w/o alcohol--the place is seriously overpriced. Although you do get several courses, the main dishes (chicken, cous cous) are not properly seasoned and the chicken is not the best quality cut. Probably the best part of the meal was the dessert, which was way too big for three people. 

The bellydancers were fine. We tipped and even got a friend in a picture. He thought the place was great (he lives in Utah) so I guess if at least one of us was satisfied, the night wasn't a total loss. 

But I would never return here again. If you're looking for an \"experience\", give it a try. However, if your entourage is particular about food quality, you may want to think twice, especially since they do not serve a la carte (at least the night we were there they didn't)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I paid 50 for a 6 course meal and it was worth every cent! Atmosphere is great and food was to die for. Everyone should give this place a change. It is a great intro to mediteranian food if you never had it before. Honeslty the best I have had so far!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a truly unique experience. As soon as you walk in you realize you are in for something different, a real treat :-) The walls and ceiling are draped in fabric, very dark yet has a nice glow from the candles. 

The food came out in multiple courses, all to be eaten with your hands. It was fun and I really enjoyed it :-) We washed our hands in rose water prior to eating of course and that was even enjoyable, I love the smell of rose water :-) The food tasted great from beginning to end, even the mint tea they served at the very end was a little something special :-)

The belly dancing was fun too and don't be surprised if they want you to participate with the dancing ;-)"}
{"text":"Let me just preface this review by stating why I'm giving it only three stars.  Our waiter told one of girls in our party to \"shhshhh\".  Totally rude because the response was unwarranted.  I understand that Middle Eastern/Persian/Moroccan people have a different culture, especially towards women but, we're in Vegas damn it.  And when you are a server working for tips, you are not to be dismissive.  There were other things during the course of our six course meal that he did/responded to in less than attractive/rude ways.  It's ashamed because the other bus boys/hand washers were polite and diligent.  

We start off the cocktails, who would've guessed? LOL!  Liqour-wise they're stocked but, wine-wise it's pretty much all house.  

One of the highlights of the night was the hand washing.  A guy came out with a kettle of warm rose water to cleanse our hands.  Loved it!  My hands were so soft afterwards.

Shortly after, the first course comes out.  Shrimp, looked like shrimp scampi.  I don't eat stuff that has lived in the water, yuck.  Squiggly goo, blah.  Everyone else seemed to like it though.  

Next was the harira or, lentil soup.  AOK.  Definitely a tomato/vegetable based broth. Not too spicy, not too bland, just okay.  

Third course, Hummers and eggs.  More like hummus, eggplant dip, fresh vegetables, and fresh bread.  The hummus was okay.  The eggplant dip, okay.  It sort of had a bitter salsa taste to it, quite unique.  The bread was good and soothed the bitterness from the dip.  I don't eat veggies, LOL.

\"Where's the beef?\"  Guess what, beef skewers were our fourth course.  I bet you weren't anticipating that.  For presentation purposes, the skewers were stabbed into a fresh pineapple and had about four or five large bites of beef (assuming sirloin) on them.  They were tender, juicy, smokey, and were really good. 

Cockadoodle Doo was our fifth course.  This was pretty good as well.  Not good enough to go back to Marrakech but, good enough to order it from another Moroccan restaurant.  I could tell the chicken was either slowly stewed or slow cooked in a juicy sauce for many hours.  To get the flavor they attained, the chicken was obviously bone-in.  So beware when chewing because it's dark in there.  This dish also came with couscous.  The couscous tasted as though it was simmered in chicken broth (yum) and had a near perfect texture.

Course number sex. jdofa;je;wajfewioj! Six.  I don't know what the heck you call the dessert bread they served but it had fruits, nuts, and lots of powdered sugar on top.  Tasty but we were all so full by then.  Along with the dessert came the my second favorite thing of the night.  The mint tea.  It looked like battery acid but, it had this heavenly scent and flavor.  I need to find out how to make this and where to buy the ingredients!!!!  I could drink this battery acid-looking stuff everyday!

Hey guys and some girls, there's belly dancers that shake what their momma gave them there nightly.  

As mentioned previously, it's dark in there (remember the cockadoodle doo course).  In fact, when you walk through the front doors you immediately walk through large red drapes and, from there it feels like you are magically transformed into something Aladdin may have dined at back in his day.  The restaurant as a whole, is small for Vegas standards, though the dining room is one large room--predominantly red, with appropriate Moroccan decor.  Tables are very low to the ground and replicate a Moroccan dining experience.  With that, don't expect to have a lot of privacy from other parties.

This was a new experience for most of our party.  It was fun but, our waiter was rude.  Hopefully, you don't get him.  Otherwise, foodwise, ambiance, entertainment, and price I would've rated it four stars.  Our prix fixe meal was a mere $40ish per person."}
{"text":"Great experience, bad service. It was beautiful inside along with the belly dancers. They serve a pre fixed six course meal at $40 per person, drinks were $10-14 a pop. The waiter was so unattentive, many times no where to be seen and two hours later we were only on our third course. We left bored out of our minds and out of cash from all the belly dancers shaking their hips for tips. I would definately recommend this place for a large group where you have plenty of conversation between many people. Average wait for each meal was 30 minutes or more. Food was decent, unfortunately a lot of it was wasted, but it was all about the experience."}
{"text":"We probably shouldn't have eaten indian buffet for lunch before coming here for dinner. 

The exterior of the restaurant looks NOTHING like the inside, you are pleasantly surprised the second you walk in through the doors and see the red curtains. The staff however didn't seem very friendly at all, we weren't greeted. The first thing they even said when they saw us was \"do you have reservations?\" Rather than greet us and say hello, that's all they asked us. I wasn't too fond of that, which just made me change my rating from a 4 star to a 3. 

The inside of the restaurant was beautiful! With fabricated walls and intricate designs. I loved it. The low lit room set the mood to a very cool ambiance. This is definitely a place for a nice date or hangout session. 

We didn't realize what we were in for when it came to the food! 6 courses I recall. First we got the shrimp with the bread. That was so good! We ate the shrimp and dipped the bread in the sauce. It came with a whole loaf of bread. My boyfriend and I just kept eating and eating more bread, then the second appetizer came in. That's when the waiter says \"oh, I should've warned you not to really eat much of that bread since you still have 5 more courses.\" Wow really? That's something he should've mentioned the second he put down the plate of bread. By that time we were halfway stuffed with the bread. 

The dip was ehh, I pretty much tried to force my boyfriend to eat most of it.

The meat skewers were very tender and juicy and came with a whole pineapple! I don't understand why it came with a whole pineapple though. It's like that wasted that whole thing just to have meat skewers stabbed into it. Kind of strange. 

The main course was very tasty! I didn't finish it though, not even half because I was waay too stuffed by then. Thank goodness they had to go boxes (which they never offered) we had to ask them if they even had any. Otherwise they would've thrown that whole meal away. 

The dessert was different, but good. It was a warm delight! I mainly focused on eating the outer layer of it though, since it was crunchy. I don't think I really touched the inside at all, ha.

The tea was awesome! And the way they served it was out of this world! I wish I could've taken THAT home.

All in all, the food was good, but the service was less than mediocre. It seemed like from the beginning they didn't care for us being their customers at all and the only people they even smiled at or tended to was the party of about 10 people that was going on across the room. 3 stars. I understand they were a larger party, but they were the ONLY other party. 

When we left, we weren't thanked for dining there, nor were we given a nice, \"Have a good night, come back again!\" like most other places would've done. 
I'd like to come back again. Hopefully I'd have a better experience though"}
{"text":"Whenever we go to Vegas, we do our best to get dinner here. It's a feast for the senses. Be sure to pace yourself because all of the dishes are incredible! My favorite is the shrimp. This place is great for get together with big groups of people. I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Preliminary reviews...very nice atmosphere! The food was good as well. After wasing your hands in their rose water once you're going to want to do it on a regular basis and take a bath in it. The food portions were small but you will leave there stuffed. Stay away on Friday eveninings after 7 to avoid the crowds at Fireflys next door."}
{"text":"Yum!  Although you don't have a menu to choose from the fixed meal is awesome.  The steak melts in your mouth and the shrimp scampi and bread is awesome.  It's a good place to take friends to...definitely not your typical restaurant.  I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"This place was great. The food and the atmosphere was off the hook. The belly dancers were fun to watch. Every bit of the six course meal was so good."}
{"text":"I loved this place the food was good! The mango lemon martini was amazing! The ambience is beautiful. The belly dancer was gorgeous and so talented! We came with a group of six people and it was automatic gratuity for us we had to do the math and figure out but other than that this was a 5 star experience! Favorite was the shrimp!"}
{"text":"I booked Marrakech for my husband and his friend's mutual birthdays. There were 8 of us. The service was outstanding! We had the 6 course pre fixe meal.  Everything was delicious, but the hummus was the best I've ever had. The belly dancers were beautiful and mesmerizing. The authentic Moroccan tent atmosphere was comfortable and perfectly lit - for either a romantic dinner or a party.  Also, each of the birthday boys got a cake and a song. You have to be prepared for the bill at the end, though - especially if you're drinking!  

To the staff at Marrakech: Thank you for a very memorable experience and packing up a special meal for me!!  Sorry we broke a glass :)"}
{"text":"Fun experience with friends (we are all locals). Ambiance was nice , dancers were fun to watch, food was good, service was good. Only con: we had a Groupon and made a reservation for 2. Later we told friends about Marrakesh and they thought it would be nice to join us . At the restaurant they asked to use the 15% Yelp discount but were denied because we had the Groupon. Seemed unfair since they came along only because we recommended it. In any event, a nice time and good food."}
{"text":"I came here with my company~ I fell for their pure pressure when I initially didn't plan to join them after work. Now I'm hooked. :)

It's a prefix menu of 6 courses.. I think. I was quite tipsy ^^  I don't know what each plate consist of but it all taste pretty darn amazing. Each plate is so unique in taste.. like, it's crazy. lol.. never knew taste like that existed! Same time we are being entertained with a gorgeous belly dancer who comes out to dance all around every 30 mins or so. Bonus stars to that. 


I'll be back. Definitely great for groups."}
{"text":"Called around 530p to inquire since I havent been there and wanted to celebrate my bday soon. This guy (I think his name is Abdul or something like that) answered the phone and was RUDE! I asked if they have another menu aside fr the 6 course dinner bec im just planning to hang out with my friends and have drinks with appetizers or something. He repeated himself that its their menu and made me feel stupid. then he mentioned abt the late night menu.i said it wasnt in the website and if i can have an idea what else do they serve. His tone was sarcastic and he was really rude. I said never mind. il just call again nx time hoping to get someone with a better customer service. my husband said that we'll just go somewhere else and not be treated like shit"}
{"text":"Let's just say that we were extremely satisfied when we left the restaurant (fat and happy!).  
I got a groupon deal for a 6-course dinner (which I actually had no idea that's what the deal was....I wouldn't have eaten all day if I knew that!).  I cannot say enough about how amazing their food was.  The shrimp was awesome, with tons of garlic and other yumminess, the soup was so-so, the beef was SO tender (thought it was lamb, apparently so do a lot of people), the hummus was the best hummus I have EVER had (the other stuff on the plate was good too, but I liked the hummus the best), the chicken was very tasty, but by the time that and the dessert came out, I could not eat a THING!!  I was floored by how much food there was and how amazing it was.  I didn't really need the glass of wine I ordered (nor the dessert; I wasn't a fan of it).
The overall experience was awesome and the wait staff was great.  The belly dancers were fun to watch (I tipped one of them). :)
I would go back if I ever visit Vegas again.  I need a few years off though...."}
{"text":"Marrakech was amazing!  We had always wanted to try this place out, and we finally were able to last night and it did not disappoint.  This is one of the most intimate and fun dining experiences I have ever had.  Every course of the Prixe Fixe menu was amazing and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Meat falls off the bone. I never had couscous that is so moist. And desert is to die for...must experience it first hand."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for years, and after a Groupon popped up offering two-for-one on the Six-Course Prix Fixe menu, I knew it was time to give it a go!

Walking into the restaurant was a surprise itself! This place is located in a strip mall off of Paradise, nothing too exciting...yet the interior is absolutely beautiful. Decorations cover the walls, low tables are in the room, fabric drapes from the ceiling with lanterns dangling as well. The room is lit very dimly as well...this is an ideal place for a date, albeit a costly one.

The night started with a Moroccan hand-washing ceremony, where the server poured a jug of rose water over Mom and I's hands. It was a neat little touch, and the water left our hands smelling great and feeling clean :)

I'll list the courses in order and talk about each...

1) Sauteed Mushrooms w/ Wine, Oil and Garlic Sauce - We opted to substitute this for the Shrimp Scampi as I don't eat shrimp. The sauce was tasty, although super garlic-ey. Mom thought the mushrooms weren't cooked enough, and to be fair, they didn't look like they had been sauteed at all. I used an entire loaf of the sesame bread they give you at the table just eating the garlic sauce.

2) Harira Soup - This soup was excellent, and tasted more or less like Tomato soup. It had a nice flavor and was served extremely hot.

3) Marrakech Sampler - This plate included Hummus, Zaaluck (Tomato/Eggplant dip), Olives and Carrots. Neither of us like Hummus, so we skipped out, but I thought the Zaaluck was extremely tasty. Mom thought the marinated carrots were alright, but neither of us found the olives very tasty.

4) Beef Brochette - This dish consisted of two beef kabobs that were stabbed into the side of a pineapple. The meat was extremely tasty and included some roasted onions and peppers. I had thought the meat would be much more seasoned and found it somewhat less tasteful than I would have liked, but it was still wonderful.

5) Couscous Platter w/ Chicken - This dish was a pretty big platter and included some cabbage and other veggies mixed in with the Couscous and Chicken. They also gave us an extra container full of chicken broth to add to our food for more flavor. The chicken was amazing. It feel right off of the bone and nearly melted in our mouths. The couscous was cooked perfectly and even the cabbage tasted great as the flavor of the dish overall rubbed into it. 

6) B'Stilla - This was the dessert item, and neither Mom or myself particularly enjoyed it. It's a pastry stuffed with fruits and nuts and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The mint tea that came with it was AWESOME though.

I also must say that this restaurant has great entertainment in the belly dancing. I've seen many belly dancers, and normally they're not particularly attractive, but the one at Marrakech is gorgeous AND very talented. She had people getting up and dancing with her in the middle of the restaurant, which made for much laughter. 

Overall, this place is worth at least one visit. I wouldn't have gone before simply because $40 per person is a little more than I'd be willing to pay for this. The atmosphere is truly incomparable and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place was beyond what we expected. The atmosphere was beautiful and the entertainment was great. The food is DELICIOUS and was so filling!! I definitely recommend everyone to come here. It is totally worth it  :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a tent with dark light and candles. The ambience is cool. They have two belly dancer runs between tables they come every 30 minutes for one song around 5 min not that much.They have fixed menu of 6 plates that starts with shrimp with lemon sauce eaten with bread then small bowel of soup that has a lot of tomato sauce then they bring a plate of hummus and other appetizer  and then meat on a pineapple then the main plate consist of 2 chicken legs with rice and carrots. Finally desert and tea. 

The food taste good and the atmosphere is lovely."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. Came here last year during my trip to Vegas with a friend. Got a groupon for it so the price was reasonable and the experience was great. Each course was excellent, the atmosphere was good and the staff friendly. Not sure if I'd come back again since it's kind of a static experience, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere  was amazing. The morrocan wine was so flavorful! The belly dancers were incredibly talented,however,  it was way to expensive for the six course meal. The six course meal isn't a bountiful and wasn't diversified in flavor. The hummus' texture and flavor was unmatched in comparison with any other restaurants iv been too. The banana dessert was to die for, but the couscous was dry and unflavorful."}
{"text":"I was just here last night for my best friend's rather tame bachelor party. We made a pretty late reservation. Everyone had amazing service from everyone at the restaurant. The belly dancer was very good.  She interacted with everyone at the table.  We didn't even realize that she accepted tips at first, she still performed for us even though we were the only ones left in the restaurant. The waiters we very cool and friendly.  One of them had a few tricks up his sleeves when tea was served. 

Now as for the food. Amazing, for both the vegetarians and meat eaters alike! I've been craving everything all day. Maybe I'll return with my wife very soon."}
{"text":"The interior of this place makes you feel like you're in a genie bottle!  Totally middle eastern style!  A server will come to your table with some rose water and a bowl to wash your hands over.  This place serves a 6 course meal and includes a belly dancer.  Some items included in the 6 course meal include game cornish hen, couscous, kabob, and lentil soup.  Food was excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a dining experience, when you walk in, it is like traveling to Morocco. The entire ambience is great with the music, decorations, and a belly dancer. 

The food is great as well. I was quite impressed with the steak kabob as well as the desert. 

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday with reservations.  Definitely make a reservation, I saw them turn customers down without reservations on a weekday.  It's very pricey but the several food course was worth it! Everything was delicious from beginning to end.  There was a belly dancer as well but it didn't feel the authentic feel because the dancer was a Asian. 

Otherwise, atmosphere and service was superb. I'd be returning for sure but not any time soon because it is too pricey"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they get two stars is the fact that the belly dancers were  amazing and the dessert at the end.  When the waiters came around with rosewater for your hands, I thought that was a great touch.  The atmosphere is nice, the dinnerware is surprisingly bland and Kohl's Department Store sale rack-ish.  The food was extra blah with no seasoning or spice.  Thought we rolled in on diabetic night.  Well, we won't be back and the food was too expensive for how it tasted.  The mint tea was excellent, though"}
{"text":"My man took me here for my birthday dinner...I was the dirty 30 plus 1. I had been dying to try this place because he told me it was fun and the food was good. As Christine H. put it so well...you step through the curtains and feel like you are being transported to a magical place. It was beautiful. 
We sat down at were handed a bar menu and a couple of towels. We were told that we going to have a rose water hand bath. It was lovely and made my hands smell like a perfume my favorite great aunt used to wear before she passed. Brought back nice memories and was definitely a different way to start dinner. The server took our drink order and asked us if we had any food allergies. After we said no he told us the first of six courses would be out soon. 

1st course: Shrimp scampi...did I forget to mention that the first 4 courses are meant to be eaten with your hands...pretty cool :) It was so yummy...garlic and citrus jumped out. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and made me excited for the rest of the meal

2nd course: Hummus, babaganush, pickled cukes, beets anld carrots. Loved both the dips although I must say I preferred the hummus.

3rd course: some form of lentil soup that was super hot and tasted kind of boring at first but then started to grow on you. I ended up pounding it because it was so good. 

4th course: Beef skewers that were served sticking out of a pineapple. You must use the bread given at the beginning of the meal to get it off the skewer otherwise you will burn your hands. The meat was cooked just to my liking and the onions had a delicious caramelized flavor.

5th course: We got a fork for this one. Chicken on the bone and couscous. The chicken was so moist and the couscous had a chicken-y flavor. I was getting kinda full  by this course so I don't think I could fully appreciate it.

6th course: DESSERT! A Moroccan pastry with cinnamon, chocolate, cream and bananas. It was light and flaky but I could only have a few bites. 

Overall I will be back again for a special occasion. It wasn't that expensive ($90 before tip for 2 people in this town is pretty reasonable for a nice night out) but it would get old if you went all the time. The belly dancers were awesome, fun and something I don't see everyday. I enjoyed my birthday dinner immensely. Thank you Marrakech :)"}
{"text":"We came here because of a Yelp suggestion when I was looking for a special bday place for under $100 for two. 

When I first walked in, I was disappointed. I expected quiet and romantic and it was loud and a bit boisterous. But our seats were cozy and close, so it made conversation easy. Once my expectations readjusted, I had a great time.

The music could be a little lower in volume when the dancers come out, and it could be even lower still in between dancers. But the cozy seating and the method of eating made it all cozy anyway. And...the music was mostly quite awesome!

The scampi was scrumptious, though though would have been completely stellar with a bit less salt. My bf's vegetarian version with mushrooms was a neat idea and worked well.

The lentil soup was some of the best I ever had! In fact, all of the food was really good. 

This was a fun night and though I wouldn't eat there all the time, this is definitely  a place to take a group. Aside from the bellydancing, the presentation of the food, hand washing, tea pouring, are all flashy, showy and FUN! 

Do it!"}
{"text":"A top notch experience from beginning to end. Both the service and the food were outstanding! Come here hungry and be prepared for a lot of delicious food."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, it's a set menu and I thought I wouldn't like some things on the menu but I was full even by the 4th/5th dish. It's family style. The belly dancer was fun. The ambiance was great. The only drawback is the seating - low tables/chairs - are uncomfortable for me and I'm only 5'1\" and my husband who is much taller was also uncomfortable. The service was wonderful and everything was so delicious."}
{"text":"i was not at all impressed with marrakech. i will give it two stars for the very cool, tent-like atmosphere, the yummy hummus and the free bottle of wine. otherwise... meh. the lentil soup tasted canned, the bread was dry and the chicken and couscous they served us at the end was tasteless.

they also have a belly dancer who will come up to your table, wiggle around and stare at you while you are either trying to eat your food or converse with your dining companion. i didn't want to be rude and ignore her, but other people were tipping her and i felt awkward paying attention and smiling politely while she danced around our table without giving her a tip, which would have made me feel creepy, like i was at a strip club or something... maybe i am just too awkward for this place."}
{"text":"YES!!! My friends and I had so much fun at Marrakech. The food and service was outstanding and the atmosphere authentic. The dancers were pretty amazing too. Thanks ladies! It's one thing just to go out and eat to fill the void but it's another to be entertained the entire evening. This is definitely the place to bring a party, forget about your troubles and celebrate life!!"}
{"text":"All these reviews must have been written by friends and family. The location was far and the decor was dated. Old chairs and curtains. It hardly looked like a Moroccan tent which is airy and beautiful. Food was good but greatly overpriced.  50$ for a handful of shrimp, some lamb and a leg of chicken? The whole rose water hand washing with an old faded black hand towel to use for the entire meal was at best lazy. What's up with the staff? I don't find the whole grumpy , pushy , this-is-how-it's-done attitude charming. That works in Paris , but in eastern countries people are smiley and over the top friendly. Should've gone to the Japanese place next door."}
{"text":"I'd never had Moroccan food before, so I figured I'd give it a try. When first walking into the restaurant, it feels like you've travelled to another world. It looks like you're in a giant tent. The menu is already pre selected, but they have options for vegetarians. They have amazing service and bring you a ton of food (I believe there was six courses). The cost is $45 a person, but the atmosphere is great, the service is excellent, the way they bring each course out separately gives you time to enjoy the meal as well as conversation with your party (you definitely don't feel rushed), and what's even cooler is they have a bellydancer performing as you eat. She was very talented, beautiful, and entertaining. I'll definitely be coming back again in the future."}
{"text":"This place is quite the experience.....  it's a pre-fixed menu with 6 courses.  The food is different but delicious and the atmosphere is super fun.  The belly dancing is impressive.  
I was a little overwhelmed by the prices on the menu- and I think they would do more business if they gave more choices on the menu.  I would frequent more if it wasn't so expensive.  This restaurant is an exciting experience- even if you go only once a year."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my dinner here on a Saturday evening, thank you Marrakech for having a groupon deal.

Our servers were very attentive.  Based on the prior reviews, I was a bit hesitant but glad I decided to see for myself.

The food was delicious.
1st-Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi: love the lemon wine garlic sauce.  We were dipping the moroccan bread pieces into this flavorful sauce that I had to keep reminding myself not to overdo it since there are 5 more courses to come.  The shrimps were small but cooked perfectly.

2nd-Harira Soup:  this was really good!  I can gulp down 2 bowls of this lentil soup!

3rd-Marrakech Sampler: hummus, eggplant/tomato dip, olives, cucumbers, beets and carrots.  Nothing special

4th-Beef Brochette:  a skewer of tender beef, very tender and has good flavor.  I was pretty full at this point so I ate one chunk and the rest was eaten by my bf.

5th-Chicken couscous (Morrocan Style): The chicken was tender over couscous.  An extra bowl of gravy was brought out in case we wanted more gravy on our dish.  We tasted some of this dish and ask for it to go.  So So full.

6th-B'stilla and hot Morrocan mint tea:  Oh wow, this fluffy pastry, wrapped with filo dough was so yummy with the mint tea.  I wonder if I can just come and have the fluffy pastry and mint tea...that would be awesome.  Anywho, the fluffy pasty was filled with chocolate and almonds, topped with more almonds, powdered sugar and cinnamon.  So good.

The bellydancers were great.  However, since we enjoy our conversation with each other, the music can be a tad bit loud.  

Conclusion:  I probably wouldn't pay $40 dinner for one.  It was a great dinner and experience but not for that price.  Therefore, I am a fan when there is such a deal."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent value, ambience! Belly dancers are fantastic! More than a dinner, this is a memorable event for anyone who enjoys a relaxing experience!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal dining experience, highly recommended for anyone wanting to try something new and exciting. Atmosphere is outstanding with Moroccan decor and atmosphere. The 6 course feast was absolutely delicious. Belly dancers come out every do often and put on a show for the patrons, and the service was excellent. Try it for yourself, the whole experience of eating at Marrakech is remarkable. Will dine again."}
{"text":"Great Place! It is an experience to eat there with a great Mediterranean flair. 
I love the food and the Entertainment Marrakech offers."}
{"text":"Wanna feel like a sultan or f$cking royalty? This is the place for you. We had the prefix meal and it was like 6 courses for under $50 bucks! They even wash your hands before and after the meal with heavenly rose water. The service was amazing and the belly dancer was an absolute delight ( tip big she deserves it!). There's nothing like this anywhere near you, we totally dug this place ...atmosphere, food and service is like no other joint."}
{"text":"Every one is very nice and the place looks very cool.   So I am sad to say that the fixed six course menu fell short of my expectations.
You don't get a choice of entries so no honey lamb,  no lemon chicken.   Bastilla is a poor version,  not the chicken and egg we typically get at home.   No wonderful eggplant appetizer. . :-(  $170 wasted.

Shrimp scampi was good  nice  large shrimp cooked to perfection .
Lentil rice soup was good.
Vegetable salad was good and so were the carrots and olives.  The humus was good, but not better than what I make at home or buy at costco.
Beef kabobs were not well seasoned and had no flavor.
The main corse couscous  and chicken with \"steamed vegetables\" had no outstanding flavor.  Tasted like chicken and rice.  
Bastillia was a disaster we were not expecting the bananas and chocolate.  I should have known when it was brought as dessert and not an appetizer .

The belly dancer was five stars,."}
{"text":"Got my Group-on tonight @ Marrakech and it was worth every dime! It was a set menu and there was not one dish that came out that did not satisfy our tastebuds.The shrimp scampi was better than some Italian places in town. The entertainers were very good. Scantily dressed women belly dancing while you eat..NICE!! Loves the decor, it was like eating i a big tent. I will be returning soon.."}
{"text":"This is hands down the coolest moroccan resteraunt ever! The decor takes you to another world. It is gorgeous, cozy, delicious, fun, clean and the hospitality is out of this world. The owner is amazing and the belly dancer was so fun! Great food loved the soup and moroccan mint tea!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine took me here for my Birthday.  I'm so glad she did.  The seven course meal was excellent. The atmosphere was great and so was the belly dancer!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the free bottle of Moroccan wine, but I was so ridiculously happy with this place. Hubby and I came here for dinner before our big Vegas night out, it was the perfect way to start the night. The decor is warm, sensual, and interesting. There were flowing tapestries and plush little booths, gorgeous belly dancers and friendly waiters. 

FYI you can order a 3 course meal here for $20 rather than the 6 course meal for $40. I knew there was no way I could shove 6 courses down along with all of the alcohol I planned on drinking later! They also have a vegetarian option, if you ask they will work with you. The waiter was patient through all of my crazy-food-issue questions, and didn't even judge me when I ended up sneaking in some shrimp. (what, its my birthday! Its not like I ate a mammal!!) That shrimp was damn tasty too, and the oil it sat in went very well with the bread. The food was so good, I was happy to eat it with my fingers. I really loved this place and skipped out feeling very satisfied with my visit."}
{"text":"MORROCAN FOOD 
6 course fixed meal with belly dancers performing. This place is quite expensive, but lots of fun.
 I'd recommend this for a change up from a typical dinner or maybe for a special occasion/celebration. They also have a full bar, specialty cocktails, beer, and wine. 

The belly dancers were friendly which added for great entertainment with their music, decor, ambiance, and dinner crowds. 
With my group that night it came to about $100 per person for food, drinks, and gratuity. 
3 Stars for this exotic restaurant in Las Vegas. It was A-OK"}
{"text":"I love this place. The 6 course food is amazing.. I love watching my son get embarrassed dancing with the belly dancers lol.. Super chill great service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was invited here for a friends birthday tonight. Didn't know this place existed. But a great surprise I ate everything here tonight and it was all good!!!! Started with shrimp scampi and bread, then had hummus and boba gonish (don't know if I spelled that correctly) then had meat kabob, and then chicken then an amazing desert with Mint tea. Everything was delicious. Service was great and the place felt like I was in Aladdin's tent. Small and very nice.  Will definitely come back again..."}
{"text":"Menu shows a lot of choices of gluten free dishes so thought I'd go for dinner.  In reality they have a 6-course meal for $49/person!  Not what I was looking for...why not just be honest rather than try to bait & switch?!?"}
{"text":"Marrakech was an epic find. Anytime someone asks if I want to go to Vegas, the first thing I think of is Marrakech and my salivary glands start going. Meat is totally fresh and seasoned perfectly. Kabobs are primo. They have this chocolate dessert that I still dream about. It was dairy free somehow (I can't eat dairy) and still the best chocolate dessert I can remember in recent years. Place is dimly lit, intimate, comfortable as can be. Belly dancers are gorgeous and blend in perfectly with ambiance. A+"}
{"text":"Always love this place! The experience is really fun for a date or just something different. I love sitting on the cushions and the rose water hand wash is quirky and cool. The six course meal is such a great value and always delicious but the best part is the belly dancers. They are super friendly and happy to teach you a few moves! (Make sure to give them a little tip and you can take a photo!) highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good entertainment and plenty of food to eat for 49 bucks. If you never had Moroccan food,  its a good place  to experience  it."}
{"text":"My previous review I gave one star due to the horrible experience with place.  I'm revising and decided to give three stars overall due to Mr. Ali, the owner,  reaching out and personally apologized.  He offered to take care of us whenever we decide to return to try again.  I wish we could have had experience the whole dining and the belly dancing experience.  But unfortunately we do not have any plans in the near future to check out the place.  Thank you again Mr. Ali for sincere apology and wanting to make my birthday experience a better."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Vegas for her 50th. She wanted to have dinner at Marrakech and we were impressed beyond our expectations! The ambiance was pleasing, the service very good and the food amazing!  Every course was delicious. Add to a perfect dinner experience was a lovely belly dancer who entertained.  I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This was the \"real deal\" genuine Moroccan experience. How do I know? Because I went with a Moroccan! He even commented that the MUSIC was authentic. It's really a great experience, very very cool vibe. They have a belly dancer every so often and everything is done \"family style\" if you choose. They even come around in the beginning and you wash your hands at the table. Great ambiance, great service and great food. I mean, what else can I say?"}
{"text":"I ate here a while back when visiting Vegas with a friend. I had a GREAT time!!! The belly dancers were awesome, the food was delicious and the service was good. It was a little pricey, but defiantly worth it! I will totally visit them again!!"}
{"text":"We had my sister's bachelorette dinner here.  They were very accommodating and made the evening for all the ladies very special.  The prices were reasonable considering you get five course.  Each course was delicious and even the pickiest of palettes in our group enjoyed them.  We really came here for the ambiance.  I mean how can you not like beautiful belly dancers dancing for you.  We had an absolute ball!  I can't wait to go back during my next visit."}
{"text":"While attending a company convention  we ventured off strip to see what goes on in LV with the locals.  The taxi ride was only about $12 from the Paris Hotel and took about 10 minutes.

The decor of MMR is very original and makes you feel like you are in a large tent in North Africa.  Everyone was very friendly, the reservation was on time and the food servers were on it.  The six course meal was very taste and fun to eat.

Not forgetting about the entertainment now...the belly dancers were lots of fun and very inviting.  We thoroughly enjoyed them as the moved around the tent like room.

The whole experience lasted about two hours and was really great.  We did not stay for the hookah pipes but next time we will do that too.

Go to MMR, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places for dinner. Food is amazing every-time I go service is outstanding. The food is amazing  starts with shrimp in lemon butter sauce. Every course honestly gets better and better. Down to every bite. Even dessert! The amazing entertainment is fun and engaging. Honestly can't go wrong with this place! If your looking for a fun and memorable place. Marrakesh is a must!!"}
{"text":"After a week of sub-par dining experiences in Las Vegas, and needing some proper nourishment, Marrakech was truly an oasis of food and uniqueness. The beef skewers and the scampi stood out above everything else on the fixed menu 7 course meal, but it was all good!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars really. 

I bought a $39 Groupon for this place which gave me a 6 course meal for 2. Reservations are highly recommended as this place is small and they get pretty busy. I loved how this place was covered in a tent. It really completed the experience. It was pretty warm inside too. 

After you are seated, someone comes by to help wash your hands because you'll be eating with your hands here. Hope you don't mind sharing cooties with your dinner guests! The 6 course meal includes:

Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi - Sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic 
It was a little difficult eating this with our hands because the shrimp was pretty hot. Quite delicious though! Very garlic flavored.

Harira Soup - Lentil, rice lemon and spices 
The bf didn't like this very much because it was on the slightly spicy side. I thought it was pretty good. I'm not a big fan of lentils but this was ok.

Marrakech Sampler - Hummus (Garbanzo/Tahini Dip)/Zaáluk (Eggplant/Tomato Dip)/Moroccan style olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots 
This was my favorite dish! I love their hummus, very very fresh. The carrots were soooo tasty. What did they do to it?! More please!

Beef Brochette (Kabob) - Tender beef marinated & grilled to perfection 
Definitely grilled to perfection here! Yum, I wish they gave more though. We only got to kabob sticks. Goes great with the hummus too.

Royal moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj (Chicken) - Served the traditional way, with heaps of assorted vegetables including butternut squash & cabbage 
This is the main course. Here you get a fork to eat with. I don't know how they seasoned the chicken but it was lovely. 

B'Stilla - classic Moroccan pastry stuffed with the fruits & nuts, topped with the heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea 
This dessert is very sweet. I feel they put way too much powdered sugar on top. Too much for even 2 people to finish. We took this to go. Be warned, it get soggy quick. 

The belly dancer was very good. She encouraged people to dance with her and you can take pictures with her too. Also don't forget to tip her!"}
{"text":"I went last week for my moms 50th birthday. This place truly is a gem and surpassed our expectations. The food and service was amazing. 
Service- both servers were kind. The Hispanic server was a little more detailed and made our experience more memorable. 
Food- everything was delicious our favorite was the steak kabobs they were perfectly cooked and seasoned.
We didn't care too much for the carrots in the hummus dish. They were seamed and chilled. It was our least favorite but 
nothing dramatic. I loved that they brought a candle out for my moms birthday. The dessert was incredible! 
Entertainment and ambiance- the seating is just beautiful loved the ambiance. The belly dancing was fun and enjoyable. The belly dancer would come in segments and perform a few minutes at a time. We saw her a few time during dinner.
Honestly a great place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The owner, Tariq, contacted me and profusely apologized on what happened.   He was very kind and completely gave me refund for my dinner.  

I've upgraded to 5 stars for him making such a great effort in trying to make it right.  

If you're tired of buffets and want a fun evening with good food and entertainment, come to this place.  Portions are large and leave room for the dessert!!  

Don't be shy, get up and dance with the belly dancer!!  My mom did!"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food. Great atmosphere. It's a hidden gem. So much delicious food. The staff is so accommodating. I can't say enough how much I love it.  A trip to Vegas is incomplete without a dinner at Marrakech."}
{"text":"I was not expecting this place to be great but I was surprised! The food was delicious, the staff was fabtastic.  They made a special night even better for my group.  From the decor to the yummy food, it was a delight to dine here!"}
{"text":"Great food with great show... Our server is great gave me an extra pineapple slices, thank you so much..."}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had a blast. Food was excellent. Belly dancers were very entertaining. A unique experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars! I usually don't like cuscus, but this place was awesome! The chicken and beef was tender. The appetizers were delicious. Really liked the belly dancing and pre-fixed menu."}
{"text":"What an experience!! My wife and I decided to try this place on our anniversary after finding it here on yelp. It was beyond our expectations and we will most certainly come back with friends and family when we can afford it. 

First off, when we entered the restaurant I was shocked at how small the place is. Everything was in one small room with no source of outside light. Once you pass through the curtains at the entrance it is almost like entering a giant tent! Very awesome ambiance, the lights and the low seats and everything made for a very unique experience. 

It was also really cool when they came to our table with towels and some rose water to wash our hands in! If you aren't aware yet, Moroccan cuisine involves using your hands for most of the meals. So they bring one big plate of food and everyone serves themselves with their hands. Not a big deal for my wife and I thankfully. 

Ok, now for the food. The scampi was yummy, both my wife and I agree it was better prepared than most restaurants would do so. The shrimp was still plump and the sauce was wonderful with the bread they brought out. Careful though, stains aplenty here!

The soup was my least favorite but one of my wife's favorites. I thought it was a little better than canned tomato soup, but my wife thought it was the best she'd ever had. 

The salad was incredible!! I normally don't like hummus but this stuff was insanely good, combine it with the carrots and I was in heaven. Came with a few veggies that are marinated and my wife and I finished it off far too quickly for our tastes.

The skewers were awesome, but I jumped in a little too quickly and burned myself on the onion =P. The meat was perfect though and just melted in my mouth once I could eat it safely, lol.

Mmmm, the chicken. Sadly my wife and I were getting full by this point, but we still tried it. The cous cous was not to my or my wife's tastes, but the chicken was moist and just fell apart in my hands. Excellent cold as well since I took it home as leftovers and enjoyed it the next day.

Finally the dessert.... nearly killed me since I'm borderline diabetic  so I only let myself one bite. Soooo much powdered sugar, lol, my wife enjoyed it but we both agreed it could have used more chunks of fruit inside.

As for entertainment, the dancer was pretty cool and she is quite talented, but I'm thankful she kept some distance from me and stuck to the larger groups. I'd rather not have found myself on the couch later due to my gawking eyes, lol ^_-"}
{"text":"This place is so fun!!!!!  Was the perfect place for a celebration
I'm not gonna lie, I definitely thought this was going to be one of those places where you go for th experience but the food is just okay. I was wrong!!! The food was delicious. Hugeeee portions but everything was so good. 

The decor is absolutely beautiful inside! 
I wish they had more dancers to make a more upbeat vibe but I result enjoyed this place"}
{"text":"Take a break from the hotels and chains!   This is a great experience!   Great food, cool belly dancing and relaxed atmosphere!   So glad we tried it!

Be prepared to spend a few hours there -- and to eat A LOT of food."}
{"text":"So much fun!  Took a friend who had never experienced Moroccan and she loved it.  She even danced with the belly dancer!  Service was impeccable!  First thing they asked for allergies, dislikes, and intolerances; they accommodated without judging or hesitation.  Soooo much food and everything was delicious.  It was late in a Saturday and I made an Open Table reservation (1000 points!), and they knew it was us as soon as we walked in.  Only made the reservation 25 minutes before.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an event! Six course meal with entertainment. Food and service were excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was on my husband's Vegas bucket list.  As locals, there are places you want to try or things you want to do, but regular life gets in the way.

So, for his 40th birthday, I decided to treat him to this experience on Friday night.  

The decor (which I never comment on) was amazing.  While we were eating our dessert and chillin' a bit, we really had a chance to look around and the place is just so interesting and beautiful to look at.

We started our meals with beer (him) and a mojito for me.  The Marrehech mojito is no joke, by the way.  I probably should not have had the second one, but it was so tasty.

The prefix menu is a crazy amount of food.  A couple of recommendations.  First, eat a baby size lunch that day before going in.  When you get the first course of shrimp scampi, despite the deliciousness of the homemade bread, stop yourself from completely gobbling it all down.  You have a long way to go and if you go too hard at the beginning courses, the main course will arrive and you will have no room!

The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Well seasoned and a good texture.  The second course of the veggies with the hummus was good.  The hummus was the best part.  The soup had a nice kick to it, but I am not a huge fan of rice in my soup, so I just didn't eat the rice.

The steak was amazing.  But all of this left me to look at the chicken and couscous with sadness.  I knew that if I had a bite of the chicken that the dessert would be unattainable.  Therefore, I determined that the chicken and couscous would have to come home with me (which made an amazing breakfast).  The dessert was this interesting pastry with bananas and hazelnut inside with cinnamon on top.  It was seriously good, but the jasmine mint tea was the finishing touch to the meal.  I stole the hubby's and finished his off, too.

The belly dancers were talented.  I got a cute pic of the hubby with the dancer.

Thanks for a great night!  We would love to return with friends."}
{"text":"Where to begin? The shrimp. The bread. The humus... I don't know what I loved the most. I loved it all! The mango martini was delicious. I LOVE this place. I come here whenever I'm in town. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"so flippin' good i cant stand it. i could not believe how much food was served - we were literally bursting by the time the main course came around. packed most of the chicken and the dessert to take home, which is awesome. the servers were great, really polite and friendly. wasnt crazy about the wine we chose, but whatever - we could have sent it back (they gave us the option) and we didn't so no biggie. so good! and hey, i moved here from NY, so i know good food!"}
{"text":"What is a visit to Las Vegas without visiting Marrakech!?!  Its always our #1 to-do.  Their food is outstanding, the decor is plush and cozy, the lighting is low, and the belly dancers and music are stellar!  We love the rose water hand washing before the meal. It is an extraordinary start to an extraordinary eating experience.  We have been there for both romantic dinners for two, as well as fun family dining with the kids.  The food is brought out one course after another...huge family style portions of the most amazing culinary delights.  The service is perfection and the location is only 2 minutes off the strip (kiddie-corner to the Hard Rock Hotel).  Every cab driver knows exactly where this place is.  Its a Vegas must!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If you're in Vegas you have to stop by and check it out. It's more than just a dinner, it's an amazing experience! The decor and music creates the perfect ambience.  The belly dancer really ads to the whole experience.  The food is delicious. The Waiting staff are great. The owner Tariq stopped by and talked for a moment. What a great guy. My wife and I had an experience that we will never forget."}
{"text":"No doubt my experience here may have been a little skewed because my friends are tight with the owner, Tariq, but I absolutely loved this place.  What a great combination of tourist attraction, good food and good service.  The inside of the restaurant is really like being inside of the genie bottle on I Dream of Jeanie. 

The amount of food you get with the six course dinner is incredible.

Course #1 - Shrimp Scampi - So lemony and buttery.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Maybe my favorite course.  

Course #2 - A hummus platter of pickled carrots, olives, pita bread.  The hummus had a great flavor.  Loved it. 

Course # 3 - Some type of hot tomato soup.  This was the only course I didn't enjoy.

Course #4 - Beef skewers.  They're presented in a pineapple, more for show than anything, but this course was so good!

Course #5 - Chicken with couscous.  Enjoyed this.

Course # 6 - Dessert.  I don't know how else to describe it.  By this point I was seeing stars from all the food.  I remember it was a warm pastry with fruit and nuts and a half ton of powdered sugar.  

All for $40 a person!  Admittedly, I have little to no experience with belly dancers, but I thought both of the dancers we saw were great.  This place was entertaining and far exceeds Tournament of Kings in terms of entertainment and quality of the food.   

I plan to go back and bring out-of-towners because Marrakech is such a unique experience."}
{"text":"My first impression about this place walking in is wow, definitely not what I expected. It's a very lounge like place. The food is wonderful and you eat with your hands; however, one of the dish you get they give you a fork. I'm pretty sure it be difficult eating rice with your fingers, lol. The kabab is to die for esp when dipped in their hummus. The chicken cuts through like butter. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their dessert at the end. It was a pastry stuffed with the fruits & nuts, topped with the heaps of powdered sugar and cinnamon. Not a fan of the fruit part."}
{"text":"Beautiful in the inside, nice beautiful music the dancer great!!!!! Food soooo amazing very nice service ...  LOVE ITTTT"}
{"text":"I love going to this,restaurant because they offer really good hummus plate and also very delicious ghormeh sabzi and they also have very tasty drink menu"}
{"text":"Received a gift card so we went here on a whim and now we can't wait to go back! This is a great restaurant to bring out of town friends to, or if you're in Vegas for the weekend and want a unique meal. It's a huge meal (literally 6 courses) and there's a ton of variety. Plus they are extremely accommodating for those with dietary restrictions - vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, shellfish allergy etc. Just let them know when you make your reservation and they'll take care of you. All of the staff are attentive and the belly dancer was great!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The shrimp scampi is literally out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. High priced, average food, and atmosphere. The part time belly dancer/part time stripper was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service and belly dancing! The 6 course menu has shrimp scampi, Harrira (soup), 4 small plates, and the beef kabob which were all great. The main chicken course with Cous Cous was just ok and the desert was good. The ambiance and the experience was 5 star and the food was 3 star."}
{"text":"I am dumbfounded by the rave reviews for the food at Marrakech. I've had better food in the employee dining room at Caesars Palace!!! There are much better places in town to get middle eastern food... maybe not Moroccan, per se, but do you really consider two withered beef kabobs jammed in a pineapple with a birthday candle on top Moroccan?!
I did love the ambience here. The room is cozy, red plush sheikh-chic, like the inside of a Bedouin tent. The bellydancer was really beautiful and very talented, and danced for most of the meal. The service was pretty good, and the seats are comfy. In short, everything was going along great until the food arrived!
OK, maybe I don't know enough about Moroccan food (I've only been to one other place that serves it), but I was expecting more delicate spices and exotic sweet/savory blends, grilled meats and interesting stuff like that. What we got was: white bread and shrimp scampi... minestrone soup (OK, it's supposedly \"lentil\" soup but it tasted like Chef Boyardee to me)... a few pickled beets and olives with hummus and more white bread... the aforementioned beef kabobs jammed into a decorative pineapple... some sort of salty stewed chicked and potatoes... and a GINORMOUS apple-baklava-pie thing that looked like it came from the bakery at Costco, doused in powdered sugar and dumped unceremoniously on a plate. I'm kind of a foodie, and this was not foodie-food -- this was food for people who are too busy ogling a bellydancer to care what they're stuffing into their salivating maws.
I had been wanting to come here for a long time, and  I was very disappointed.  For those seeking an Arabian Nights-vibe, I would recommend Paymon's over this any day -- although they don't have belly dancers, so if that's the main draw for you, then enjoy your white bread and Chef Boyardee... but don't eat the pineapple; they \"wash\" them and re-use 'em."}
{"text":"Great place for a fun date or group. The food is really good and there's lots of it. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We enjoy our time here at this restaurant. The decorations inside was lovely and I liked the ceiling. seating was nice because I got to sit right next to my boo. They start off by washing your hands by pouring water at your table. Then they give you the shrimp appetizer with bread. I loved the shrimp appetizer! It was so good and the sauce was good for dipping for the bread. Soup also came with the appetizer. My boo ordered the Rose wine and it was delicious. Next time we will order the bottle. Then the hummus was brought out with pickled veggies. I didn't care for this part. I prefer soft pita bread with hummus and the veggies was pickled with a weird taste. The hummus was ok. Next was the kabobs on the pineapple. I loved the meat kabobs. It was delicious and filling. By the time we got to our entree we were pretty full so we got the entree To go and ate our dessert there. They pour hot tea for you with your dessert. I loved how they pour the hot tea it was so cool my favorite part! the dessert wasn't for us. I didn't care for dessert. The girl who was belly dancing for us was really pretty. I definitely enjoyed the entertainment. She asked us to dance with her and I made my boo dance with her. Overall, we had a great experience here."}
{"text":"Dont waste your money!! This place gets a 2 star only because of the nice Ambience and sexy belly dancers. VERY Average food & VERY over priced!!!!There are SO many other awesome restaurants you can enjoy in Las Vegas for the price you pay here!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this Moroccan restaurant for quite some time since it's so close to the convention center. So decided to seize the opportunity on my last evening and was not disappointed!

Was quite intrigued by the décor from the get-go. Felt like I was sitting inside a lavish tent awaiting a sumptuous banquet. All of the furnishing, wall panels and light fixtures were so beautiful and ornate as if I have traveled to a distant land.

Our party of two ordered the 6 course Moroccan feast which includes the Moroccan style shrimp scampi, harira soup, sampler of hummus, zaaluk(eggplant/tomato dip), olives, cucumbers and carrots, beef kabob, couscous with chicken and a beautiful dessert pastry filled with fruits and nuts.The prixe fixe meal also came with mint team and homemade bread.

Did I mention live belly dancing? The lady who performed several of the songs appeared in different costumes and boy was she talented!

We were devouring the bread and the first entree - shrimp scampi as soon as they came out. It was absolutely yummy! Actually everything was just simply delicious! 

We had to eat the first 4 dishes without any utensils which was really fun because the bread acted as a soaking and scooping element. I was quite relieved when forks appeared for the cous cous. I think that would have been challenging to use just hands and fingers.

All in all, we were so stuff by the time the cous cous was served that we almost couldn't eat the dessert. The dessert was so good that we managed to eat half of it.

What a great restaurant. I definitely will return."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with all that went amazingly well during our visit. The service was some of the best I've ever had, reminded me of the friendliness of the host staff at our riads during my visit to Morocco. 

They wash your hands at the table by pouring water over them over a bowl. Then we were delighted with one of my favorites, authentic Moroccan mint green tea. The meal is 6 Courses and each was spectacular! I am gluten free and they were able to accommodate me among our group of 6 with substitutions on 3 courses, everything else was fine. 

The Moroccan rosé also took me back to my visit to the country. We were entertained twice by a belly dancer. And again, the staff were all so very friendly and professional. I was visiting but asked someone I knew who lived there for a recommendation off strip and she gave several options, noting this as her favorite...I definitely learned why! It was a very quick ride if you're staying on strip, certainly worth the trip. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Having visited the Marrakech website beforehand, I was disappointed that the menu online isn't what was offered in Las Vegas. I asked for some options & the waiter stared at me & said, 'What?' & 'we don't have that' - I was informed I'd be having the pre set 6 course meal (NEVER my favorite thing - I like to choose what I'll eat). But, I was in a group setting for a birthday, so I'm being  a good sport. #1 - shrimp, fine. #1 - Lentil soup - ok, I didn't like the tomato base, prefer it more traditionally Middle Eastern. #3 - Hummus, veggies, baba gammosh, hummus was great, veggies, too, disappointed in eggplant. I love baba & this was some sort of variation (pickles? salsa?) that I didn't really like. Oh, & the bread wasn't pita bread. I've never eaten in any type of Greek/Arabic/Middle Eastern style restaurant anywhere that didn't serve it. I wasn't pleased with the bland, round white bread offered. #4 - Beef kabobs, too well done for me. One of the reasons I don't like pre set menus. I would have ordered it rare. Gave mine to someone else. #5 - Chicken, cous cous, veggies, again - bland & nothing special. Tasted like anything I'd get at any American chain (Panera Bread, Chilis....) nothing remotely spicy or exotic about it. Next came a sickeningly sweet tea that nearly no one in the party touched. Oh, I'd ordered tea at the start of the meal & was never refilled or asked if I'd like another. #6 - Dessert, some sort of banana & chocolate meets filo dough with so much powdered sugar, people were sneezing as they ate. NO ONE wanted any of it to take home which is a HUGE indicator that my disappointment was not unique since I know many of fellow diners are dessert lovers. The music: Too Loud for Talking!! We had to ask them to lower it, I just accepted that I'd have to lean in & speak into people's ears all night. The belly dancers - FUN! I'd gladly have them do their shows every 45 minutes or so & take over the place. That's part of the experience. In between, the music should be back round level. For $50 you can eat many, many huge tasty meals in las vegas. Won't be going there again. I had even recommended it, since I'd never been. I  like new dining places. I had eaten so little, I was hungry when I left, went home & microwaved myself some leftovers that I enjoyed more."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Marrakech a couple weeks a go during our short trip in Vegas and it was definitely a highlight of our weekend! The service was great and everything came out pretty fast. The place has a beautiful ambiance and definitely makes you feel like you are having a cultural experience. Most importantly the food was AMAZING!! It was also one of the cheapest meals we had in Vegas. In such an expensive city, it was nice to have a great meal experience that was affordable. You don't want to leave Vegas without checking out this spot!"}
{"text":"This meal comes in six courses so come hungry. The rose water hand wash is cool. The seating is cool. The place looks cool. The food was not good to me. The main course tasted very bland like i would make at home. I have live in Turkey, been to Greece and expected a bit better. The soup tasted like alphabet soup. The bread was awesome. Just not happy. Oh and they forgot my discount i was supposed to receive so all around looked cute but not the taste"}
{"text":"I'd never had Moroccan food before but saw the groupon deal and decided to try it out with the in-laws. 

The food is the same 6 courses for everyone. Do go when hungry cuz it's a lot of food.  The meat was cooked perfectly (beef kebobs, chicken with cous cous) The overall food experience was good. 

The atmosphere is more romantic to go as a couple, not necessarily to bring your in laws or even hanging out with friends unless your friends really enjoy belly dancing.  Not a fan of how we felt pressured to tip the belly woman though we had nowhere else to look but her due to the loud music and her seductive moves.  

Overall I would have said 3.5 stars but I always like to round up."}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to come here with a party of 6. It is a set menu, 6 courses for $40 per person. The tables arent that comfortable though since its low. They start off with washing your hands in rose water. The first course is a shrimp scampi which was a delicious sauce that the bread went very with. We gobbled it up. the soup was an ok tomato like soup, and the hummus dip was really good. They served the next course, the beef kabobs in a pineapple with skewers. The main course was really good with couscous, raisins and very soft chicken. I thought the dessert was amazinnnngggg. It was like a fruit pastry with fillo dough and the tea that ended with the meal was sweet and delicious. 

Oh and the belly dancers made the night enjoyable with some great entertainment."}
{"text":"We've had Moroccan food before, but last night's dinner was awesome! The menu is a set six-course meal for $45 per person and well worth it. Took my mother here for her birthday dinner and she and the entire family loved it! The first course was a Moroccan-style shrimp scampi that was so delicious, sauce and all! The second course was a lentil and lemon soup that even my 17-month old grandson couldn't get enough of. Third course consisted of cold vegetables (cucumbers, carrots, olives, a pepper salsa) and hummus. I'm the only one in the family who really enjoys hummus but this hummus was so creamy we were all fighting for the last bit of it. Beef Kabobs followed and were perfectly cooked. Last of the main courses was quartered chicken with couscous and vegetables. The chicken was so tender it fell right off the bone. And for desert - a flaky pastry filled with bananas, chocolate and walnuts served with warm Moroccan tea. All was superb and we couldn't finish it all. Looking forward to leftovers tonight. We will definitely be going back.

Oh - and for the entertainment, a belly dancer puts on a good show. The grandson was so mesmerized that he couldn't take his eyes off her!

If you're looking for something different and unique while in Las Vegas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. This is about 1 mile off strip on Paradise near Flamingo. It is a set menu for $45 per person.

To start they bring out an empty metal pot and a pot of rose water to wash your hands. Hand towels are provided to dry your hands and use as your napkins for the dinner. The first course is a lentil soup which you drink, followed by a delicious shrimp scampi. Bread is provided to dip and scoop with your hands. They then bring out a salad plate with a creamy flavorful hummus and pickled vegetables like carrots, beets, olives, etc. The next course is my favorite course. They bring out skewers of filet mignon (I think). The meat is so tender and perfectly seasoned. Next they bring out cornish hens with couscous. This is my least favorite part of the meal, but it's still yum. Finally they bring out the dessert which is a pear and walnut phyllo dough pastry with tons of powdered sugar and cinnamon, but the best part of the dessert is the mint tea. I could drink a gallon of this tea. 

The service is timed perfectly and they have belly dancing."}
{"text":"Went for the second time the other night. Still enjoy the atmosphere and most of the courses are pretty good. I like the scampi course and the beef kabobs best. Would absolutely be a 4 star review if we had not been served a subpar bottle of wine. We ordered a bottle of Moroccan wine for $35. Reasonable price. Well, the waiter did not pour a taste for my husband. As soon as we sipped it we knew why - it tasted bad, like grape juice. I waved a waiter down and said as much but was told that is how it was supposed to taste. Paying for gross wine that we didn't even finish left a bad taste in my mouth. Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"I chose Marrakech for my official birthday dinner because I wanted a combination of  dining and entertainment. It's a pre fix menu which may turn off some people but I didn't mind because I saw this as a dining experience. When you walk in It's like your transported into a an exotic tent. The rich colors and music set the mood. When you are seated you are greeted with someone who will rinse your hands with aromatic rose water. The beautiful fragrance lasts long after the meal. 

The first course is the Shrimp Scampi that comes in a lemon, garlic , and white wine sauce. It is accompanied by some fresh bread that you can dip in the sauce. I don't typically like to eat up all of the Scampi sauce because I think it is a little thick but this one is perfect for dipping and not too heavy. 

 Harira Soup follows the Scampi. It is a lemon and lentil based soup that has a little kick to it. It felt great after coming in from the cold . It will warm you up! 

Just when you think you think you are getting a little full the Marrakech Sampler is brought out. It consists of Hummus (garbanzo, Tahini dip) , Taktooka (Moroccan green pepper and tomato appetizer) ,olives, cucumbers, beets and carrots. 

The fourth course is two skewers sticking out of a pineapple. My picture only had one because we were to anxious so we ate one before the picture could be taken. It was tender and juicy. When I first saw it I thought that it wasn't enough but it is. 

The main course is a Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Djaj (Chicken). The chicken falls off the bone with ease. The sauce is tasty and mixed with an assortment of vegetables that included butternut squash which I'm amazed I ate . I typically hate butternut squash but the sauce was that savory that it changed the taste of the squash into something acceptable. We were so full by this time we had most of it wrapped so we could take it to go. Plus my husband and I try to make it a rule to make room for dessert. 

B'Stilla should be known as be still my heart lol. I loved this dessert because it is different than your ordinary pie or cake. It is a pastry made from Filo dough stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon . It had some nice textures going on between the flakiness of the dough, the crunch of the almonds and the creaminess of the bananas. We had some hot mint tea that went great with dessert.

While your eating all of this fabulous food you are entertained by a belly dancer . They will also let you join in on the dance. I was thinking for my 40th birthday wouldn't that be a cool profile picture for Facebook if I too was dancing? That thought didn't last too long when I was asked I chickened out because I was too shy like always. (story of my life) . I had a Moroccan like blouse on it would have been perfect but I sent my husband to go dance instead. 

The only thing I would have liked to see on the menu is Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) , stuffed tomatoes or onions. I'm not sure if that goes along the line of Moroccan Cuisine but it is one of my favorite middle eastern dishes if it is made correctly. It's fun place to celebrate a special occasion but you can't be in a hurry. It takes about 3 hours from beginning to end ."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was really amazing. 
I made our reservation for a Saturday at 9PM for 8 guests but needed to change it to 9 guests. I called and spoke to Tariq, Owner/GM, and advised him of our addition.  He said that he would have to push our reservation back to 9:45PM, since the table he had for us could only seat 8 people. I was a little disappointed since I didn't want my guests to wait to eat so late, but hey its Vegas right!. Tariq told me that if he could accommodate us sooner he would text me and let me know (in my head I was thinking yeah right) Well at around 9PM Tariq text me and said come on down we are ready for you. (big kudos for the great customer service)

The restaurant is rather small but so intimate and inviting. The decor was beautiful and felt as if you were actually in Morocco. They start off with the traditional handwashing. Then brought out 3 heaping platefuls of Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi which was sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic, it was so good. (two of our guests were vegetarians and so they had sauteed mushrooms which they said was very good). 
They then proceeded to serve us the soup and sampler which included 
Hummus (garbanzo/tahini dip), Taktooka (Moroccan green pepper, tomato appetizer) Moroccan olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots

The Beef Kabob was so tender and flavorful (veggie kabob for the veg)
and the main dish Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken were so delicious.  There was sooo much food and all of it was so tasty. Not to mention the fun exciting atmosphere with the belly dancers. We all got up and tried dancing a little. Overall a great great time.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great ambience & service.   The rose water smelled beautifully & the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun! Just make sure you come with an appetite or with at least 4 people. There's just too much food! But friendly service, great belly dancing show, and delicious food.  

It's dark inside but not uncomfortably dark. You can sit on chairs or the cushioned area but the table is knee height so be prepared to lean over. 

Will definitely come back. Had way too much fun!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't know if I ever ranked a place this low. But I feel it is important to note the quality of service and food you'll receive here.

We began our night hoping for a reservation across the parking lot. When they were full we Yelped and found Marrakech right here so we gave it a shot. We were with a large group of 10 and were sat pretty quickly, about 15 minutes which was nice compared to the hour plus wait we left to come here. 

The music was very loud and we requested it to be at a more realistic level so we could talk during their 5-6 course meal. It would have been strange to sit there that long and not be able to talk at all. Every 45 minutes or so they had a belly dancing show with even louder music, which is fine since it's not too often and made for the experience overall.

It took a while (15 to get our initial drinks) where we ordered wines. Even longer yet to receive any food such as apatizers or bread. We acctually had to ask to receive something after another 20 minutes of receiving our drinks. 

The first place received was breads, humus, olives, etc. which was fine and the last quality food brought out. I won't go into the details of each dish to follow only to say for the expense we were not happy at all. 

The wait staff was pleasant but very slow and lacked understanding of the level of sound and need to communicate ones there.

The place is neat looking inside and the concept is fun. Just won't be returning since food and service is too important."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  This was our first time.  We had reservations for four and were promptly seated upon arrival.  No waiting and the place was packed.  Food was very good and plentiful.  Even with four we couldn't finish everything.  The service, however, could be improved.  Our server was very perfunctory.  Just the basics and really didn't say much else.  We advised that one in our party was a vegetarian but they promptly forgot.  When the first meat course came we had to remind them.  Then, when the main course came, they forgot again.  We didn't ask again since our vegetarian was already full.  That being said, we still enjoyed the evening.  We'll go back.  Hopefully the service issue was a one time thing."}
{"text":"Went to this place while visiting Las Vegas. I went with a friend that has never been to an Arab place. It was not far from the hotel. We went on a Saturday night. We had the fixed price menu.. The shrimp was to die for. Succulent, lemony- perfect! The bread was good. The lentil soup- I have tasted better. The cous cous... not so outstanding cause it was a little mushy! Their appetizer plate was really fresh. Their hummus, baba ghanoush and beets were delish.  Service was pretty good. They took pics for us which was really nice of them.. 

The belly dancers were pretty good. I got up and danced after the first dancer pointed for me to join her on the dance floor. I can belly dance pretty well. She must have felt that I started to steal the attention from her since a few people seemed to like my dancing- so of course.. she turns her back to me and keeps dancing by a group of other customers. She needs to make her living. So it's No big deal obviously. I still danced a little more and my friend took pics. This place is overpriced- but the place makes up for it with the service and the atmosphere. Oh I forgot my credit card there and the waiter ran to give it to me. That was very kind of him. It's a good place to check out.. however, it's Vegas and there are so many yummy places to try out.. Like the buffets for example!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service and belly dancing. This is a fantastic place for a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Most of the food was neither Moroccan nor particularly tasty. This was a complete waste of time, money and diet calories. What a tourist trap!

Cons
- $40 for this food was way too expensive. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending money. But, this was unjustified given the quality
- Water to wash  your hands with was cold
- Course 1: Moroccan style shrimp scampi - this wasn't bad. But, if I wanted a dish that tasted like any other shrimp scampi, I would've gone to Olive Garden
- Course 2: Harira: tastes exactly like Indian lentil soup. The Moroccan version has less tomato and more lemon, not to mention less spice
- Course 3: Marrakech sampler - The hummous and the Zaáluk tasted like they came from grocery stores. The Olives, cucumbers, beets & carrots are clearly canned
- Dessert: tasted like banana nutella crepes. It was hard not to snort all the powdered sugar
- Couscous: wasn't bad, but didn't even have the basic moroccan flavors you'd see at decent moroccan places
- Wine: nothing much to write home about. Overpriced though.


Pros
- Kabobs were good
- Ambience and belly dancer were a saving grace"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.. and lots of it! Excellent service!!! Great belly dancer entertainment! True Moroccan atmosphere!! Really enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with my entire company here for a conference. We rented one the whole place and it was awesome! The staff was so attentive, atmosphere was spot on, belly dancers, and the food was amazing!!! When you rent the whole place out it is a set 6 course dinner, however, I have a few food allergies. I told them what I was allergic to and they said no problem! I'm allergic to shrimp and once course was shrimp scampi but they provided me my own dish of mushrooms in the scampi sauce and they were the best mushrooms I have ever had! I'm also allergic to bananas and the dessert was based on banana. They gave me my own personal ice cream with chocolate sauce! I would highly recommend this place for a fun off beat dinner!"}
{"text":"Marrakech is a beautiful little place serving Mediterranean, Moroccan and Middle Eastern food. Located in a small shopping center on Paradise Road in the same block as the Las Vegas Convention Center, this gem gets a lot of convention center patronage. It's handy for that crowd, who tend to travel in packs -- there's a two-hour group \"party package\" with open-bar for $85 per person, or a wonderful six-course prixe-fixe feast for $50 per person. Those are the popular picks, though there are also individual menu choices -- beef kabob, chicken, vegetarian options and a very popular shrimp scampi that lives up to its local reputation.

As wonderful as the food is, the ambiance and entertainment propel Marrakech into a \"dining experience.\" Step through the door from a dusty Vegas shopping center and find yourself transported to Morocco. First time visitors are wow'ed by colorful, intricate wall-to-wall tile mosaics, lighted sconces, gorgeous textile hangings, and metal Moroccan wall art. You're seated on soft couches at low, intricately inlaid tables and offered a feast of food and drink. They take special care of first-timers and they warmly welcome back regulars. Periodically throughout the dining experience you'll be entertained by belly dancers, who invite willing patrons to join them on the dance floor. 

Next time you're in Vegas, get off the strip and go to Marrakech!"}
{"text":"REAS BEFORE YOU GO!!
first -the food is less then an average Mediterranean restaurant,soup is tasteless , bread is not fresh,beef kabob is salty and chewy like a rubber piece!!! Coscos is a pre made from a store! This is not a real Coscos!! The cake in the end cannot even called a desert very cheap version of the authentic one.
NOW-you don't get any silverware unless you ask. Yes-no fork,no knife not even a spoon for the soup! 
WHAT YOU DONT NOW IS: 18% gratuity is added automatically!!! 
Also if you come as a group they will give you a share size dishes very small in order to save on you!"}
{"text":"Fun and delish. Its a bit pricey but if you aren't a picky eater, you can get your money's worth. The belly dancers make for a very different experience. The only thing I didn't like was the dessert course. They should offer hookah too (:"}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant. Enjoyed the ambience of the place. Its a 6 course meal that is fixed but the pricing for the meal per person $49 is worth it for the experience. The belly dancer didn't come out until we ate our main entree, but it is a nice touch.

Shrimp scampi was sauteed in lemon wine and garlic and it was amazing. Dip the morracan bread in the sauce!

The harrira soup was warming 

The hummus and eggplant dip was great

The beef kabob was cooked medium rare and had flavor, seasoned well. Just becareful removing from skewer with hand because it was very hot. 

Didn't really care for the couscous with the chicken entree (main course) but the chicken itself was tender n moist.

Dessert had a very hot filling so becareful. It's a pastry stuffed with bananas, nuts & chocolate. Topped with heaps of powdered sugar, cinnamon and served with traditional mint tea.

Would recommend for couples &/or group of friends."}
{"text":"Love this place, Entertainment and really good food. We had the prixe fixe and it started with Shrimp scampi. The best I have had sans my little sister's. Hers is the best and this was close. The entertainment was really good and for a Tuesday it was crowded. We had the lentils very tasty not too spicy. The Kabob at the end which was good and bad, because we chowed down on all the hummus and shrimp and lentils..oh my! By time dessert came we were full. We had 2 glasses of wine and water. I love this place when in Vegas!
Sorry no pics to share just yet."}
{"text":"Marrakech is a restaurant off the Las Vegas strip with a Moroccan theme & food. It is one large room elaborately decorated in a \"tent\" like environment - complete with a belly dancer. The menu is Prix fixe - 6 courses with lots of food. They offer a good variety of traditional Middle Eastern dishes. Definitely fun atmosphere and you can also practice your be belly dancing skills during dinner if you are so inclined :) Will visit again"}
{"text":"The ambiance is unique. You walk through the curtains and you cannot help but look around you. The food will fill you up. I went with one person and we did not end up finishing the \"main course\" and dessert. The hot tea before the tea was much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a strip mall and much smaller than their photos depict.  The decor is worn but gives you the feeling you are at an intimate party in a Moroccan tent.  

The food tasted amazing.  My very picky boyfriend even like most of the dishes.  Very exotic dishes and atmosphere.  Worth the trip off the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre experience :-( pushy servers offering 6 course meal, even when we were not hungry. they reluctantly offered a ala-cart menu, when we offered to step out as we were just not that hungry. tent looks dark and dingy rather than exotic ! pretty sad experience all in all. Some people were seeming enjoying ! not us."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Service was great, food was excellent, and the dancer was exquisite. Highly recommend if in town."}
{"text":"I've frequented this establishment a few times and let me tell you, it's absolutely amazing. I love love love the food. I'm totally hooked!! I am actually going again this friday. Crazy, huh? No! I am just in love with great food. My awesome friend, Jennifer The Great, bought a couple of groupons and shared them with me, and ever since then, I've been in love with this place. I'd never tried Moroccan food, this was my first time, and I'm so glad she introduced us. The service is exceptional to say the least. The staff is so friendly and genuine. I love the dim lighting, the atmosphere, and of course, the entertainment. I would recommend this place to anyone. PS The shrimp is the die for!!!!!"}
{"text":"watching Aradia dance is the only reason to go there, which makes it not worth the $40/person. the food isn't bad, but lacks flavor, even I make slightly better couscous, and compared to my mother-in-law's couscous, this is chicken sweat. I wouldn't go again, because it seems like all they have is a set menu."}
{"text":"I've gone to Marrakech for years, and it's usually a good experience, but on my last visit (with a Groupon), everything seemed to have gone downhill.

I think we got the same chunky Cuban waiter Nikki H. mentioned below. He was incredibly unpleasant, forgot to wash our hands until it was time for dessert, and he repeatedly forgot out drinks. It was an adventure just trying to get a water.

The time before last, I was here with a large party, and the same chunky guy scolded my stepmom for saying she doesn't eat beef, after he asked if anyone has any dietary restrictions. Whatever.

The food was the same as always, with the shrimp scampi being my favorite part, but they seemed to be trying to rush us out of there while taking good care of everyone else. My husband even participated in the bellydancing and tipped the girls well, but we were still treated like dirt.

Overall, the food is okay, but I'd prefer a REAL Moroccan place where I can get some chicken bastilla. Service was awful; bellydancers are the best in town. On Marrakech's Facebook, they act like they are so excited to have their Groupon customers, but that definitely wasn't the case when we went. I won't be buying the Groupon that's currently on sale, and I doubt I'll even be back unless someone important insists on having a party there. Really crappy experience after I built it up to my friends!"}
{"text":"Very good food but music is too LOUD to have conversation with others - bring earplugs"}
{"text":"The wife and I walked into Marrakech by chance as we wanted to have dinner at a restaurant in the strip mall but they had a looong wait.  Are we ever glad we gave it a try.

Marrakech is an amazing experience!  All of the reviews below detail the delicious (and filling) six course meal, the deceptive strip mall exterior, and the belly dancers.

The one thing I would like to add is the great service we received.  We walked in without reservations, and the host graciously welcomed us.  The servers, Arturo and Efraim were very attentive, but not overwhelming.

Overall, Marrakech was an wonderful dining experience, and one I will look forward to repeating the next time I'm in Vegas!  And as the reviews below mentioned, come hungry and prepare to leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a unique experience. Yes, it's probably a little over-priced but hey it's Vegas, deal with it.
In addition to getting to expereince a little of the Morrocan traditions, i.e., Rose Water hand washing, Belly Dancing etc.. the food is also really good!
The shrimp appetizer is one of the best things we ate all week and the kabobs were just awesome.
If you're looking more fun and less stuffy than the other options in this price range, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"*Moroccan Night* 

My fly girls and decided to host a grown and sexy ladies night holiday gift exchange at this festive little off-strip restaurant.

Marrakech was rated top ten restaurants via Open Table which added to the excitement.

The six course dining experience was EPIC.

Round 1 Shrimp Scampi: The zesty lemon flavored was so delicious 

Round 2 Harira Soup: The soup had hints of tomato flavor which isn't my first choice of vegetable soups none the less it was pleasant. If your looking for a spoon there aren't any just grab your bowl!!

Round 3 Sampler: I'm new to the world of hummus and I actually enjoyed it

Round 4 Kabob: I live a PESCATARIAN friendly lifestyle and my kabobs were modified to Shrimp which were amazing!!

Round 5 Vegetarian Couscous: I was completely full by this time. I sampled this dish and it was just okay. 

Round 6 B'Stilla: Oh my I love a good pastry and this thing is gigantic and very delicious.

I had a blast!

My only recommendation is that the bartender circle back to the tables more frequently. I was pretty thirsty"}
{"text":"Place is great , love the ambience and the food was great . We went there for our anniversary and it's weird that they never acknowledged it especially when I told them when I made reservation. Also the server wasn't very friend and they need to slow down the pace the food comes out. I do recommend this place for sure and hope to return on s busier night so we have people sitting around us no isolated alone by the entrance ."}
{"text":"Showed up today excited to take my family to this restaurant, we were sat down and then a rude waiter comes up to us and says OH I didn't know you were here with kids. Then he says its $50 per person even though I didn't ask and then when he sees that we didn't get the hint he tells us he's going to move us to the back of the room and takes away our menus.

Restaurant was dark but had family style seating so I don't know why at 6pm it was weird to him that we came with kids. Anyways the food might be good and the ambience is authentic but can't tell you anything about the food because we left feeling very uncomfortable. They got the extra star for the ambience."}
{"text":"If you like Moroccan food, this is a must! A few minutes away from the strip and I can't say enough good things about this authentic restaurant. 

The menu is preset and they perfected each and every dish. My wife and I are huge fans of cuisine and out of all the countries we visited, it was surprising to find the BEST one in Vegas.

Come with an open mind and an empty stomach!

Did I mention amazing belly dancers? Easily the best Moroccan restaurant we've been to"}
{"text":"Marrakech has become a bit of a staple for me when I am in Las Vegas. My father had taken me and some clients here long ago and I have loved it ever since. 

The restaurant is in a weird spot just a few blocks off of the Strip but well worth the ten dollar cab ride, trust me. It is pretty unassuming from the outside but upon entering you are transported to a middle eastern wonderland. Seats low to the ground, tent like drapery and intricate hanging lamps create a far away vibe. 

Once seated your hands are washed over a bowl with rose scented water as you will be eating with your hands for most of the meal. Can you say \"romantic\"? Tray after tray of beautifully presented items are whisked out while you lounge on the seats and enjoy the experience. Shrimp scampi, lentil soup, hummus and marinated veggies, filet skewers, couscous and chicken followed by a seriously decadent phylo dough pastry filled with apples and raisins. 

While you dine the most sexy belly dancer you have ever seen wiggles and writhes between the tables. If you are not thoroughly turned on by the atmosphere, the entertainment and the food you must be dead. 

Marrakech is best either in a large group or just for two. I can only imagine being on a date at such a place--uber romantic. And, with a large group the laughter and indulgence is sure to please. I've been with a group of about 10 and I've been with just myself and a gal pal--next will have to be a sexy man to enjoy the ambiance with."}
{"text":"I have only been to Marrakech once.  The service was okay.  To many of them standing around and talking.   The 6 course meal was great.  I would like to see a better vegeterain option.  The dessert was amazing.  I am looking forward in going to the Marrakech in California, I heard the expierance there is a must."}
{"text":"2 stars only because there was a belly dancer. Both of the dancers we saw were really good.

As for the food:

My tastebuds were more excited during free lunch in the employee dining room today. I felt like the first four courses could be procured at my local albertsons and cooked in fifteen minutes on my stove. Dessert was some banana with sugar? on sugar? and a extra layer of sugar on top.

The final shot of tea tasted like Starbucks black tea with honey.

At 40 bucks a pop normally, i felt that it is seriously overpriced. Thank god for groupon."}
{"text":"A must try restaurant experience in the Las Vegas valley! With an affordable price fix menu of $49.99 a person, it is definitely worth the price! Just the ambiance and service alone was impeccable. The feast is 6 courses served family style. No forks required! This restaurant is great for groups or a date night, reservations strongly recommended. The belly dancers are beautiful and engaging and encourage crowd participation. Rosewater is placed on your hands at the end of your meal, smells heavenly!"}
{"text":"First let me say I went to this place 20 years ago for my 18th birthday and absolutely loved it. Tonight I take my family and it still is the most wonderful experience and the food is amazing. My husband who is not very adventurous absolutely tried and loved everything. The decor is still as beautiful as I had remembered and the belly dancers are so much fun to watch. I ordered the coffee and let me tell you I will be dreaming about those tiny cups of deliciousness . 
Can't wait to go back and this time it won't take another 20 years."}
{"text":"The staff including the belly dancers were very friendly. Food was very tasty. We had originally drove to the Japanese place next door but the cool Arabian atmosphere won us over."}
{"text":"The BF and I had a little date night planned. Dinner show with Moroccan food and gyrating booties! 

*Lentil soup & bread- the bread was good and the soup was nicely spiced. 
*Shrimp scampi- I don't see how this belongs in a Moroccan place, but as far as scampi goes it was alright. 
*Hummus & Zaaluk- hummus was alright, but the zaaluk (eggplant dip) was tasty. They gave us beets, olives, vinegared cucumbers and carrot sticks to dip.
* Beef Kebob- this was pretty decent, slightly salty. 
* Chicken (Djaj) platter- chicken was juicy and thrown on cabbage and cous cous. This was okay, it wasn't really an exciting dish to make as the main. I have had some real Moroccan tagines before and they are full of flavor and was expecting something more exotically spiced. This was more like what I would make in a tagine at home if I didn't have a lot of fragrant spices on hand (which I always do!)
* B'Stilla- from the description on the menu it sounded like a baklava with fruits in it. What we ended up getting was a puff pastry with chocolate, nuts and banana. It was not was expecting, but decent. It was very heavy with powdered sugar on it though. 
*Mint Tea- this was really nice, lightly sweetened. Wish they gave you a whole pot and not just a cup of this hot tea. 

On a plus, food came out piping hot! 

To drink throughout the meal we got Iced Mint Tea which is the same kind as what they were serving us with dessert. It's good iced as well as warm. It was $5 though! I think they do that to get you to be even with those drinking. C'mon now though, tea is cheap to make. 

Service was attentive and really good. I like how they wash your hands in rose water and my hands smelled nice throughout the night. I picture our music room looking like this place eventually. 

We came rather late so there weren't many parties there dining. The belly dancer was really cute and very good at what she does. I think since it was a small group we only got a short show (maybe 15 minutes of dancing) and sat around eating dinner with music and was hoping they come out in intervals but she was never to be seen again. Is it like that during packed times or are there dancers constantly out? If its the latter then we kinda got screwed out of a show then just because it wasn't a packed house. We're still customers. It's probably a different experience when there's a ton of groups participating. 

I had a groupon so it covered some of the cost. Still even with that I am not sure about the value of dinner and a show.  It's expensive for what you get. The dinner for two would end up to be $118 regularly (2 meals, tip for belly dancer and waiter), $58 with groupon.

I'm glad we tried it and had the groupon, but I think it was a one time experience. I just feel like for $58 I rather have gone to AYCE sushi and for $118 then I would go to the strip and get ourselves a $40 taster so we get  a gourmet meal. For a dinner show- I rather go next door to teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Wonderfully Old-School where they wash your hands with rosewater and everything is served family-style in 6 courses with bread and your fingers as the primary utensils for the first 4.  Everything was really good but the pickled carrots, shrimp, baba ganoush, hummus, and the desert were real standouts.  The belly dancer really WAS a belly dancer!  She had a great energy about her and was a lot of fun.  The music was a TOTAL trip:  traditional middle eastern music sung in Arabic AND French, with reggae sung in French as well.  (O.K. The reggae in French was damned strange to listen to but it speaks to the various colonial cultural influences that shaped Morocco over the last 100+ years.)  They open up the Hookah bar at 10 PM so that is always an option after dinner as well.  When I come back in a few months with my wife this will be one of the must-go places for us.

WARNING:  The Prix Fixe menu is really meant for AT LEAST 2 people.  It was only $39.95 but would have fed 2 VERY hungry people easily!  I only managed to eat 4/6 dishes by myself last night and then had the last 2 for breakfast this morning!  ;-P"}
{"text":"Food was great...ambiance was great. I think my only complaint would be the situation of the chairs and tables. The chairs seemed too high compared to the table. I have heard they used to have pillows on the floor which would make sense and be easier to reach the table and also see the dancers. Regardless...great experience both food and drink were very good. Will visit again."}
{"text":"i didnt know what to expect thinking about morroccan food in the cheesiest city in the country. but the food was amazing. it was many courses of flavorful food. from beginning to end we all loved the meal. and for once some where had a hot belly dancer"}
{"text":"I love Moroccan food. 
I was buying flowers, and this place was in the same strip mall.
Their dishes are very traditional; shish kabob, Mediterranean salads, felafel, etc., and they're all fine.
However, their hummus tasted like it was store bought.
The prices were in line.
I've seen the belly-dancer once, and she was competent.
The decor was very nice, and the service was good."}
{"text":"I usually don't like writing reviews for places that already have a ton of reviews....unless it was just a horrible, horrible experience. But Yelp won't stop putting it in the corner of my home screen because I made a reservation through the link they provided. So, here we go. 

This place was a lot better than I expected. I've always heard it was a cool place with belly dancers, and of course, guys love it. I appreciate good dancers, but I always found it awkward when I'm eating my food for a girl to come up and shake her body around me. I actually got up and danced with her...the powerful influence of beer. Only one, might I add. Yes, I'm a lightweight. 

This is the course dinner they give you. 

-Lentil Soup & Bread - I normally do not like lentil soup, but theirs was made very well. 
-Shrimp Scampi - I don't know if this is really a Moroccan dish, but it was amazing.
-Hummus & Zaaluk- Both were okay, they give you pickled veggies to dip in it. 
-Beef Kabob - the meat was good, but not very tender. I wanted to eat the pineapple it  was served with more than the beef.
-Chicken Platter - It was served on top of cous cous and cabbage. The cous cous was my favorite part. The chicken was very tender and seemed stewed for quite some time. It reminded me a lot of Filipino adobo. I enjoyed this dish. 
-B'Stilla - this was a crisp pastry filled with the same ingredients as baklava. It was okay for me. I'm not very big into Baklava because I hate nuts in general.
- Mint Tea - They give you an entire pot of this hot tea. 

I think the service is good and you should usually come with a group of people. A lot of people like this place, and I can see why just for the atmosphere. It is good food, and they are quick to serve you. It is a lot of food, so go hungry. The prices are a little too much in my opinion, but this is close to the strip. It's hard to find a good deal with food that's worth the price they're charging. *ALWAYS make a reservation*"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a huge fan of this place. Been there a few times and plan on going again. However, I was pretty disappointed in the response the server and bus boy had in DUMPING an entire bowl of soup all over two out of three people in our party. They destroyed my friends beige suede pumps and my boyfriend had what looked like puke all down his pants and shoes. It was pretty disastrous and their response was \"I'm sorry, here's a towel\". Kind of odd but then I realized two of us had a groupon so I'm sure they figured all was good since we got a deal. Bad form on their part but like I said I love that place still. The food is amazing and it's a really fun place. Watch out for that clumsy bus boy though...."}
{"text":"This place should be a definite must if you are in Las Vegas. As soon as you step into this place it is like stepping into Morocco. I made a reservation for our group, and it was $50.00 per person for a 6 Course Delicious Meal, which included an amazing pastry dessert and Moroccan Tea.

There was so much food we could not even finish it. The Belly Dancers were simply beautiful  and amazing.

Overall, a top experience worth every penny."}
{"text":"My company had dinner here last month & OMG it was amazing! The belly dancers were on point & got us up dancing. Not to mention the shrimp scampi (the BEST I've EVER had!!!!), let's take a moment of silence to drool over the tender shrimp in garlic/butter sauce ..... Every dish was flavorful & with 6 courses even the hungriest of the hungry were full. They have a full bar, intimate lighting (great for date night) & not to mention the friendly staff. I'll definitely be going back, it's a must try :-)"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is amazing! They have a price fix menu for 7 courses.  Everything was excellent! First they wash your hands with rose water - very nice! First course was shrimp scampi- and the best we've EVER had!! Plus a loaf of perfect bread to soak up the delicious sauce. We don't even eat bread- and we ate more then one loaf! We were actually stuffed after first course! Lentil soup was amazing.  The hummus, baba ganouch , and veggies were so good.  Best baba ever!! Then shrimp pineapple skewers. Finally the main dish of vous cups with veggies.  By this time we were popping our bellies and just took a few bites to not be rude.  After this came the best tea Ive ever had in little fancy glasses.  And a giant dessert! Bananas and chocolate in a pastry.  This was enough for 5 people!!! We felt horrible not being able to finish all the food.  Such good quality."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this incredible restaurant.  First, the decor is outstanding.  I've never been to Morocco (hope to go one day) but the setup definitely looked like a piece of that great country.

Now I'd had Moroccan food before but THEIR food?  On another level.  They have a six course meal there which is PHENOMENAL.  You start out with a shrimp scampi in a beautifully light sauce with cilantro.  Second, you have a lentil soup.  Third, you have an appetizer sampler with hummus and marinated vegetables.  Fourth is the beef kabob and the presentation alone is worth the price.  Fifth is chicken couscous and it's most tender chicken you'll ever eat.  Lastly is a dessert which I couldn't have because bananas are in it and I'm allergic so I had baklava instead. 

Lastly, the service is amazing.  Great waiters and servers with fun personalities.  The Moroccan mint tea  served at the end is heavenly.  Great belly dancing and hella sexy performers and rose water, rose water, rose water.  Given to you before your meal to wash your hands and after your meal.  Leaves your hands feeling soft and smelling great. 

Whenever you're in Vegas, go here.  It's just behind the Strip so you won't have to go too far for great food.  You won't regret it at all!"}
{"text":"Marrakech is a must each time we visit Las Vegas. As soon as you enter, you are transported into another world. The value for your dollar is incredible with a 6 course meal for just under $50. You get an excellent harira soup, assorted Mediterranean dip platter, shrimp scampi, filet mignon kabobs, chicken with couscous platter, and a phenomenal traditional dessert called bastilla. The bread that is served with the shrimp scampi is incredible, but be careful not to fill up as there is more food on the way!

Beyond the food, there is great entertainment with music and belly dancers. They encourage audience participation as well!

The staff and ownership are quite attentive to your needs while not being overbearing.

It is an experience not to be missed if you are in the area. Make sure to save up room before you go because the food is plentiful, but they are also more than willing to pack up your leftovers to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor definitely take you to Morocco. The scampi, soup, and beef skewers were my favorite 3 courses out of the 6. The other 3 I could do without. So, with that being said, the price per person is much more than the quality of the overall courses being offered."}
{"text":"Marz' review rang a bell with me.  We also, purchases a groupon, and we tried to get reservations.  This meant we had to eat very late.  But I assumed that they had been filled up by groupon members.  No problem.  The reservations were two weeks out!

Then, that evening, I was delayed in an out of town airport.  I called three hours prior to the reservation time to explain our reason for cancellation.  I asked to make new reservations but was told to call at another time! 

I then get a note from Open Table, the site you must reserve through, that I was listed as a \"no show\" and I was at risk of not being able to use open table again!  

Needless to say, I was dismayed.  

Then, I tried again to get reservations but they were so far out, I couldn't seem to book them on line so we decided to walk in.  In fact, I tried to get 5:30 reservations for Oct 3, but the site said there were none for that day.

We walked in at 6 pm and were asked how many.  We indicated two, and my husband noted we have a groupon.  The gentleman then said, \"We don't have availability tonight.\"

Now, we were there 1/2 AFTER the time we wanted, and there was only ONE table with two people seated at it utilized.  The restaurant was EMPTY.  But they had no availability for us at 5:30, and none when we walked in.

Obviously, they want to space out their groupon customers.  Well, I asked for a refund.  And I will never go back.  I'd love to review the food, but since I haven't been in a few years...I really can't.  I never got to try it.  Beware Marrakesh groupons!

Thank goodness, Yolies, upstairs from Marrakesh, had a place for us.  We were able to eat to our heart's delight and had EXCELLENT service. They were quite full, but still found a quiet table to serve us!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm going to put this out there.  I haven't been to Marrakech for a while, but I feel they deserve a review.

I loved the one time I was out.  I'm a student of Arab Dance myself, and went with another dancer friend of mine.

We had a blast.  

The food was delicious, and Aradia was dancing that night...she is a local treasure.  Second generation dancer, who has been dancing at Marrakech for years and years...she blew us away.

I'd love to come back out again, sometime in the near future...I'm actually thinking about maybe coming for my birthday in March.  

Love Marrakech!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon and I should have bought more. A fun time with a variety of dishes served between lovely belly dancing. The food is fine, the decor takes you to Marrakech, and the dancing, what do I know? A fantastical evening!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, an excellent service... This place is very nice and clean, food is so fresh and tasty...one of my favorite spots in Vegas... :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been there for 35 years.  We went last night and I was hoping it would be good as I was the one that recommended it and I haven't been there in 20 years.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere the food the dancing everything was fantastic!  For a place that probably sees a lot of tourists once they act as if you are a local (which we were) and give you a first class experience.  Good job, I won't wait another 20 years."}
{"text":"Staff is courteous food is bland and service is good hence the 3 star rating.. Better places to spend your money"}
{"text":"I've celebrated many birthdays (mine and family members') here and I've never had a bad experience with the food or service.  Good food (6-course meal for a reasonable price) and belly dancing, what more could you ask for?

I love the interior - it's like you're in a tent.  So cozy.  Your dinner starts by washing your hands in fragrant rose water.  From the prix fixe menu you get shrimp scampi with bread, harira soup (lentil), hummus with veggies and olives, beef kabobs,  cornish hen with couscous and b'stilla with mint tea.

They have about 3 belly dancers per night.  The best one is the brunette with long wavy hair (Aradia is her name) - she's the one on their business card and she can do things with her belly I did not imagine could be possible!  She can make beads hanging from her outfit on her upper stomach shake/vibrate.  And I'm like, \"how'd you do that???\"

I recommend making reservations as they tend to get pretty busy especially on weekends.  Be prepared to belly dance.  If you're really tall, your back and knees might hurt as seats are pretty low.  Get ready for a fun night!"}
{"text":"this place is great to go with a group.  you have belly dancers everywhere and a 6 course meal... the food is good, but I love to go more for the ambience.  it's a fun place and you sit low to the ground... service is great."}
{"text":"We had the best time here! The atmosphere is great- very authentic decor, loved the belly dancer and the wait staff were funny and attentive! The food was also really good- its a 6 course pre fixe for $39.99. We had so much food left over we were sad we didn't have a fridge to put it in at the hotel. We started with shrimp scampi, then a tomato-lentil soup, a hummus platter with marinated vegetables and eggplant, followed by beef skewers served in a whole pineapple (these last 2 dished were my favorites), finished by a chicken, squash and cous cous dish topped off with a desert of phylo dough filled with fruits and nuts. It was seriously satisfying, delicious food!

If we lived in Vegas we'd be back. Our birthday girl had a blast and it made for a really fun night!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best middle eastern food I have had in the US! From the service (Rose water hand washing!!!) to the dancers, to the intimate setting, it was just a wonderful experience. 

The shrimp was my husband's favourite but the kabob (very tender and perfectly seasoned) was mine. You absolutely cannot leave without getting the b'stilla - a delicate dessert that just closes off the night perfectly."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. We came here for a birthday dinner for 3 people in our group of 12. The service was phenomenal, the belly dancers were beautiful and very talented. The staff was very accommodating to my tomato allergies and made me a special meal, which was delicious. I have never done Moroccan food before and after my experience here, I'm wondering what took me so long. If you are looking for a wonderful dining experience, great food and entertainment, look no further. This place is only a short cab ride from most hotels on the strip. Do yourself a favor and stop by this place."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends last night for the start to a bachelor party.  I'd wanted to check it out for a while because of the belly.... I mean the favorable food reviews that it gets here on Yelp and for the promise of hips, er, dips, skewers of meat, and bread that I'd read about here.  

First things first, we were greeted warmly upon entry and seated.  The seating structure took me by surprise a little as we were right next to another group that seemed a little too close for my usual standards of comfort.  In a restaurant the further I'm seated away from the next table generally the better I feel.  Anti social behavior FTW!  Luckily another friend took the spot closest to the next table, and I breathed a sigh of relief.  The handwashing ceremony was nice, even though my friends and I made fools of ourselves trying to figure out exactly how to participate.

We each decided to try some different specialty cocktails from the menu during the meal, and personally I found them too sweet for the most part and therefore disappointing.  At $10 a pop I expected a little more out of them, but I should have known to just stick with what I tend to like.  That's what I get for being adventurous in my libations  

We each did the 6 course prix fixe meal.  The following is the 130th recap of all 6 of those that exists here:

1)  Shrimp Scampi - I liked this a lot.  The shrimp tasted fresh and there were plenty to be shared between all of us.   Accompanying it was a huge plate of fresh bread that tasted great dipped in the Scampi sauce or with the shrimp on it

2)  Lentil soup - Decent, nothing I would order again a la carte.  It was tomato based which is not normally my preference

3)  Hummus and eggplant dip - I love hummus and this wasn't my favorite I've had by any means but I enjoyed it still.   I dont really like veggies so I'm disregarding that there were some on this plate

4)  MEAT ON A STICK.  Beef skewers sticking out of a pineapple.   I don't have to get it to know that these were delicious.   For the 4th plate in a row, bread was not spared and in fact we asked for a 2nd plate of it to be brought out during this.   Moral of story:  bread goes with damn near everything in life

5)  Chicken with couscous.   I liked this more than the rest of my party I think.  I tend to like anything that consists of a grain like substance mixed in with various meat and veggies.  I also got a giant chunk of chicken skin in with one of the bites which would have only been more delicious if it was fried.  Bread used with this?   You betcha.

Prior to the 6th plate being brought out, we got some hot tea that they pour from like 3 stories up high into a small cup.   Showoffs.   Once it cooled down, I thought it was very nice.

6)  Some chocolate/banana pastry dish.   I rarely order dessert on my own, but when it's placed in front of me I'm like a moth to a flame.   Tastes exactly as it sounds, which is a good thing.   No bread used for the first time in the night.

I shouldn't eat carbs again for a month.

When it was all said and done, I enjoyed the meal a lot.   I didn't dislike any of the six dishes and highly enjoyed 4 of the 6 plus the tea and bread.

Service was fine, though there was a weird moment in the beginning when the waiter asked if we had any allergies, and I told him I was lactose intolerant.  I'm not sure if his face expressed more confusion or annoyance but I believe he made a comment to the effect of \"We don't use lactose\"   My entire party thought this was what he said, which I just found completely bizarre, and I'd bet the Scampi and dessert both had some sort of butter or milk involved in the preparation.   I brought lactaid so it wasnt a big deal, but I guess I didn't really understand the interaction.  Nothing worth docking any stars.

I'd be remiss to not mention the dancers, both of whom I thought were very entertaining and not intrusive if you didn't want them to be.  Unless you're a stick in the mud it'd be hard to not enjoy yourself here on at least that level of watching them interact with the crowd.  

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The atmosphere was nostalgic for those of you that like to travel! As soon as you enter the door it is as if you are walking into another country. The room is set up like you are in a tent with beautiful colors and decorations. The food was great! Everything that  they brought out was rich in flavor and design. There was also a belly dancer that engaged with the customers. It is a must for the bucket list of places to eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party dinner before we went out. Such a great place for a big group. I like how they wash your hands with rose water. Smells so good! Come hungry because they serve so much food! I don't know anyone who can finish all 6 courses. By the time the main course with the cous cous and game hen came out, most of our table was done eating. I tried a bit of everything and liked it all. It starts with bread and a shrimp dish, followed by lentil soup and a hummus and veggie plate, followed by kebabs skewered into a pineapple, the cous cous with game hen, then dessert followed by a mint tea or something like that. Everyone loved the dessert (apples and peaches baked in phyllo dough), and even though we all swore we were full, most of us ate the dessert anyway.

Belly dancers provided entertainment and music was piped in when the dancers weren't performing. You eat with your hands for the most part and the chairs around the tables are kinda low so it was weird because I was wearing high heels and my back kinda hurt so I had to take my shoes off. I'm not even sure how much it is, because the organizer of our group just said to put in $25 each for the bill. I thought it was pretty reasonable for the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"What a great place. Food is delicious.  The shrimp, kabob, chicken, hummus and the atmosphere and the servers are the best.  Off the busy strip but still close to the action."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Moroccan food and belly dancing, make Marrakech one of your Las Vegas destinations. It's a great place for large groups or an intimate table for two, as long as you're looking for a truly entertaining evening of food, drinks, music and fun.

So why only three stars? For me, there's nothing wrong with a solid three star rating. Start with one of their mojitos, but be sure to stir it and don't sip from the straw at first. I did, and got a huge sugar blast. Easily fixed, and I had two more during our six course feast.

While Marrakech makes every effort to accommodate gluten free diners, some of the dining experience is lessened by having to use a fork instead of what looked to be amazingly tasty bread. My colleagues, who are not GF, confirmed the bread was quite delicious. The couscous too. Half the fun of this style of dining is the whole communal vibe, so having separate plates and altered courses is a little isolating. 

The courses themselves are all fine, but don't fill up on the shrimp and hummus. Make sure to save room for the chicken and the dessert. Mine had to be served cold, sans pastry shell, but I thoroughly enjoyed it along with the excellent mint tea.

The only thing missing from the Marrakech experience is a hookah lounge, but our excellent belly dancer provided stellar entertainment, along with the raucous patrons on hand that evening. Don't be shy, get up off your feet and dance! What happens in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I pretty much agree with what everyone else said about this place.  I guess the menu is the same everytime which is fine for what it is.  I would go to this place with a big group in a heartbeat.  How does anyone finish the 6 courses?  Every table there got a box to go...no way you can finish the game hen."}
{"text":"I went to Marrakech with my family for my birthday dinner this week and really enjoyed the experience. 

However, there were a few things that were odd to me. We went on Wednesday evening and there was only one other table seated in the restaurant. I was surprised that they did not have more business than that and honestly it worried me a little. That also made it a little awkward when the belly dancer came out. Though she was wonderful and very entertaining it felt a little like she was performing just for us and that made me slightly uncomfortable. I don't know why. 

For the amount of people in there the time I felt like the service was a little slow. Perhaps they were giving us time to chat and digest between courses? 

I really liked that they washed our hands with rose water first. It smelled amazing. 

The food was very good. The flavor of their hummus is wonderful. I really liked the beef kabobs but they were very very hot so be careful! The mint tea with dessert was a perfect ending. And speaking of dessert it was amazing! It's called \"b'stilla\" and it's basically chocolate, banana, and walnut warmed up and gooey inside puff pastry and coated in powdered sugar and cinnamon. We were all so full and then suddenly found plenty of room to stuff ourselves with dessert. 

Overall, it was a unique and fun dining experience and something I would recommend trying at least once."}
{"text":"This was a fun and unique experience. The food was amazing. My only complaint was that it's too much food. We left so stuffed. Haha It was definitely delicious though. 6 course meal with dessert. My favorite was the shrimp scampi. Their mojitos are really good. The belly dancers are very talented and entertaining. Very cozy atmosphere. Service is great. All around we had a wonderful time and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  From the minute we set foot into the tent that is Marrakech, we were pleasantly greeted by the host who showed us to our table.  We were immediately encapsulated in this dining experience and it's authenticity.  Wow!!  

The food is fresh and delicious.  Let's not forget about abundance of food (which anyone can do), but to capture the authentic Mediterranean cuisine is unparalleled in Las Vegas.  ONLY at Marrakech.

Our servers were always kind and courteous.  They anticipated our needs before we knew what was needed."}
{"text":"simply amazing! there's no other way to describe it!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service policies. If you have a groupon, I would get your money back from groupon & purchase something else. I've had terrible experiences on 2 occasions(i walked out the first time and was forced to go the 2nd time)simply because management wants to be difficult. Rather than satisfying and building a loyal customer, they would rather screw their customers out of their money.  I guess it makes sense since I imagine no right minded person would go back a 2nd time, so they may as well get what they can on your first visit. Charging a party of 3 the price of a party of 4 makes no sense. At min. I should have received the 4th meal to go or been served posrtions for 4 people...not just get robbed of $43. If your not going to follow your fine print on Gift certs, then you shouldn't have it. 

The food was just Okay... I have definitely had better like food for a the same price or even less. 

I absolutely will not go back to this place. They are not accommodating whatsoever and apparently on the verge of shutting down if they are so desperate for an extra $43 dollars that they are willing to not obey their own policies and sacrifice the customer experience."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience with my boyfriend and his son. We all got up to dance and over ate the fancy, delicious and lavish 6 course meal. Thank you for making our first time so memorable!!!

Would recommend and go again!!!!"}
{"text":"To be honest these are the kind of places I miss in bigger cities like NYC, LA, & Chicago. A restaurant with real culture that you don't have to go into a giant Casino & get treated like just another number to see. Marrakech has a glamorous ambiance, top notch food, music, dancers, the whole nine all while maintaining a local appeal. It's kind of in the cut, so trust your GPS if not familiar w/ the city, but trust me you won't be sorry finding this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome atmosphere, awesome entertainment, what more can you ask for. I went here last year for a company Christmas party so the whole restaurant, which is small, was closed to the public. It is a fix menu consisting of 6 courses. You start your meal with an awesome shrimp scampi, followed by hummus with vegetables, filet minon skewers served in a pineapple, then the main course which is a cornish hen with cous cous, and finally a Morracan desert which I can not remember the name of. Before dinner starts you rinse your hands with warm rose water poured from a pitcher and a bowl underneath your hands to catch the water. A towel is then provided to dry your hands. Several times during dinner there is belly dancing to provide entertainment. The belly dancers encourage patron participation beckoning for them to get up and dance. All food is served in sizes to fit the amount of people in the party. This is a great restaurant to get a Morracan experience and the price is just right for the amount of food you get. You can also order cocktails or a nice Morracan wine or beer. Make this a must eat place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and ended up leaving ..
It is only served as 6 course meal ...
Run down and shitty inside ..
Rude employees!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. It's off the strip so if you come here, you should be craving Morrocan food pretty badly. I eat Morrocan regularly and found that their food was not as sweet (a big plus in my book). It's a traditional \"eat with your hands\" multi course dining experience which starts with shrimp scampi, then harira, a salad plate, beef kabobs (delicious), chicken couscous, and ends with bastella. Bastella is one of my favorite dishes... when made traditionally (chicken, egg, nuts and powdered sugar).  However, this place made theirs with bananas and chocolate... an American twist but nowhere near as good as the traditional method of preparation.  The dancers are lovely and the service is great.  They were very timely given that we had a show later that evening to attend."}
{"text":"For the record, I went here last Saturday, November 13th.

So this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I'm not too into planning dates, because, well, that's not my job as a woman. James hadn't been to Nevada so he wasn't much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he'd pick the cuisine and I'd pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn't really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn't just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.

Well, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I've driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro's but in actuality, it's a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.

I literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn't quite middle eastern but it's really similar - or just enough so that it doesn't much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn't, and they sat us anyway, which wasn't a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it's very dark, so you don't have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don't feel as if you're being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. 

We were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I'm 5'9 and James is 6'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I'm a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. 

James and I were given a wine menu but we didn't order any booze and we weren't offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That's about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. 

Hmmmm... I'm not sure how \"Moroccan\" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it's a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. 

The next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*

The crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. 

The next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't a big deal. 

We didn't eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. 

The dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.

Honestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don't think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let's be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don't know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I'll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that's really what it's all about."}
{"text":"First time I went to Marrakesh was back when Yelp wasn't popular, and choosing a restaurant was more of a crap-shoot than it is today. First visit was a somewhat funny. They brought a large bowl of water filled with rose hips. Our first reaction was to drink it. Now come to think of it I'm a little embarrassed. Food was great, haven't had a lot of Moroccan food to compare to, but it was certainly delicious. Belly dancing is always a plus."}
{"text":"My sexy lover brought me here as a surprise date night kinda jam. We got there at 5:30 which was opening time and was seated in the corner of this AMAZING room that didn't even seem like a restaurant! I was being taken on a culinary and visual journey that I had no idea was gonna happen. First they tell you that it's $50 per person ahead of time which is good IMO. Next they literally wash your hands in rose water at your table I felt so spoiled! Then the courses come out, one by one we get down on this food I almost feel like I don't deserve such indulgence but I digress as we approach the 3rd course the music gets louder and the belly dancer comes out , at this point I'm like is this real dinner and a show . Yep she danced for us, we danced with her and she was great. Now I wanna give  HUGE props the dessert holy moley in my life had I never had such decadence. It's  like if I was gonna die and I had one thing to eat it'd be the dessert. The staff was very attentive and timed the courses perfectly. I'd definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We had a 6 course spread. The whole family participated in the belly dancing. Great fun."}
{"text":"Attended a private party and didn't know what to expect but the food , service and atmosphere were amazing. Belly dancing for entertainment was a fun addition to the night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must for some delectable Mediterranean eats including hummus, beef kabob, chicken cous cous, lentil soup, shrimp scampi, and a delicious pastry. It is a preset menu including all of this and the atmosphere feels as though you've been transported to another world. Along with the belly dancers and attentive service, we had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Attended a bachelorette dinner here this past weekend and only one word comes to mind DELICIOUS! The entire meal was full of flavor and new experiences, great to make new memories with the girls! This was a first time dining experience for us and I honestly can't to bring my bf back for date night! You guys killed it!"}
{"text":"A very fun experience! A $45 flat rate for a 4 course dinner. The food is good/interesting. You eat with your fingers. They have belly dancing. And the service is good as well. For a date nite you really cant beat it. If your not a stick in the mud applebees type of person you cant do wrong by checking this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is, as indicated by the three stars, \"A-OK.\"  I was in the mood for something new and different, and Moroccan food at Marrakech, seemed to be it, especially reading all the good reviews.  But, I was less than impressed.

First, the food: 6 course set meal, for $40/person-
1) shrimp scampi type dish w/ fresh bread- good, but tastes like any other scampi dish you get at an American restaurant, with just a hint of a foreign spice; the shrimp were a little dry
2) lentil soup- good but tastes like Campell's Tomato Soup with rice.
3) \"salad\" which consisted of various vegetables and hummus- hummus is awesome, seasoned vegetagles ok.
4) beef skewers- this was the best part of the meal; the steaks were juicy and the vegetables (scallion and green bell peppers) were perfectly cooked, but there were only 3 pieces, which was disappointing.
5) Chicken-I had two bites and put down my fork; the chicken was super dry and combined with the cous cous, I felt like I had cotton mouth.  Thank goodness for my delicious Lebanese beer.
6) Dessert- This was pretty good, but there was too much powdered sugar (if that's possible) and cinnamon.  I wish there was some type of custard inside, which reduced the dry texture of the dessert.

Second, entertainment: I can honestly say that even though the food was sub-par, the entertainment was definitely an experience.  I mean, 2 scantily clad women shaking their booties, how can you go wrong?  

I definitely think that this place is more of a group adventure, where everyone can have a chance to dance with the ladies and be merry, and ignore the fact that the food is not that great, and somewhat overpriced.  If you want authentic Moroccan, I don't think this place is the place to go, but for a good time with friends, totally worth it.

A-OK."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!  Absolutely loved it!   This was my first experience with Moroccan food and I was not disappointed.  :)"}
{"text":"Made reservations and arrived at 9:30 on a week night.  Ambiance and decor are very nice and make you feel like you are in Morocco.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.   Six course meal was authentic Mediterranean, tasty and filling.  Belly dancer was icing on the cake.  Definitely recommend this place.  A truly unique experience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food, service and entertainment were all great here. The seating is very uncomfortable but it is all part of the atmosphere. I think this place was a great deal too at 40.00 each."}
{"text":"This is such a cool little place. The decor is very fun. There is a price fix of $50 per person for a 6 course delicious meal. We started off with shrimp scampi and garlic bread. The 2nd course consisted of hummus and eggplant salad with vegetables and pita chips. Then came the lentil soup. The 4th course was beef shish-kabobs and then the main course consisted of roasted chicken with carrots, potatoes, and zucchini. We finished with dessert and mint tea. Every morsel of food was delicious. We were perfectly stuffed by the time we finished. The staff attentive and friendly and the belly dancer was a fun touch. If you're looking for a delicious meal off the strip, look no farther. You won't find better food."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 12 here for a friend's birthday and really enjoyed the place.  I'm a pretty picky eater, so I was a bit concerned about the pre-set menu.  The only thing I ended up not eating was the shrimp in the first course.  I don't like any seafood, but I did dip the bread in the sauce the shrimp was in.  It was tasty and not at all shrimpy.  I loved the lentil soup.  The hummus and veggies were delicious... but the veggies were cooked, so some of them were kinda difficult to handle (mushy carrots, for example).  The beef kabobs were good, but I'm not big on red meat.  The main course, cornish game hen, was super tender, fall off the bone, and accompanied with yummy cous cous.  The dessert was also pretty good, but I'm more of a chocolate dessert kinda gal.  If I'm going to waste the calories, I'd rather it be on chocolate.  They could have taken it a little easier on the powdered sugar.  It was all topped off with some tea, which was super good!  I'm not big on tea usually, but I ended up drinking mine and hustled a couple of the other party-goers out of their cups!  Silverware was provided for the main course and dessert, and everything else was manageable without utensils.  We had a few people in our group who didn't want to take on the whole 6 course set up, so they also offer a 3 course version- I think this included hummus and veggies, cornish hen, and dessert.  I think the price is good considering the amount of food you get, plus entertainment and a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have dinner in Vegas. I made reservations for Valentines day and we were running super late. I called and Ali answered. He was very cool about it and told me he would be able to give us a table anyways. When we got there, he remembered who we where and gave us one of the best tables. The food, service, and entertainment were amazing! The place is super clean and the staff are very professional, which is the most important thing for me when I go to a restaurant. Thanks to Ali and the staff for great service."}
{"text":"Locals and first time here and very hard to say anything more that the many compliments listed previously. It was a totally unexpected experience and far exceeded our expectations in service, ambience, entertainment, quality and quantity of food.the only negative....its somewhat difficult to eat in a hunched forward position due to height of seating and table. Maybe better to lift plates to mouth?"}
{"text":"The food is decent but overpriced which I don't expect off the strip.  The kabob is delicious but everything else was just okay.  They start out with bread and shrimp scampi and recommend dipping the bread in the butter.  Well, careful with that because we filled up on bread was busting full by end of dinner.  They bring one couse at a time so it's hard to gauge how much you should eat of each course.  Perhaps several courses at a time will be better.  Belly dancers were entertaining and service was good."}
{"text":"This place is fun if you want something a little different. My ex-boyfriend took me here on date night. Is dark, quiet, romantic, and the belly dancers are a fun nice touch for entertainment. The food is good, and you do leave full, the portions are pretty good. 

The only downfall is that we had a less than enthused with his job waiter :( He had dark hair and was heavy set, a real grump. If you see a shorter chubby bear approaching your table with a look on his face as if you just interrupted him during a bowel movement then you are screwed. 

The overall experience. ambiance was a fun different type of thing.
Service and food mediocre at best.

It was $100 tab for two of us for the two pre-fix meals and two sodas."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Moroccan Restaurant and boy did I like it.  The six course meal was absolutely delicious.  From the shrimp scampi to the kabobs and on to dessert.  Every bite was scrumptious.  The belly dancer had a great personality and she was very entertaining.  The service was very good and I likes how they gave you a few minutes in between each course to really enjoy yourself.  I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Made my second trip to Marrakech while in Vegas during the first week of May.  We went on a Monday night and the place was dead!  Almost too dead.  But the food was plentiful and delicious, although there were a few gaps in between courses that could have been shorter since they weren't really that busy. 
The belly dancer was entertaining and not too pushy, which I liked.  Sometimes they can be a pain in the ass trying to coax you out of your seat to dance with them.  For the fixed price of about $40 per person, you really can't go wrong here.  You will leave stuffed and feel as though you got your money's worth.  For a first time visitor to a Moroccan restaurant I would highly recommend Marrakesh; if you've been before and are looking to try a different place, I would still recommend but it won't be anything you haven't seen or tasted before."}
{"text":"Great experience, great ambiance, delicious food. I am vegetarian and my hubby is not, both of us loved what we had. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"had a great time here with friends.  food was good, nice for a special occasion.  for me its a lot to eat in one evening.  belly dancer was fun and the service was good."}
{"text":"We had a fun evening took a 9 year old and 18 year old for their first taste of Moroccan food which they both enjoyed.   The food and service was impeccable and atmosphere very nice.   I have been to  a Moroccan restaurant before and I think the food was a bit more exotic or cultural.  The food was excellent but I think the dinner selections that were chosen were \"safe\" for people trying Moroccan food for the first time verses authentic.    When I've had Moroccan food previously some of our party found it quite a change for their palettes this time less so,  more mainstream or safe for those picky eaters.   That worked good for the kids.   I would've like a more cultural experience where I felt I was trying something new.  However it was great anyway."}
{"text":"Belly Dancing, is an art and it like any art, it should be practiced by few who have toiled and tormented to perfect the art and more importantly should have the right curves-meaning not too thin, mean or lean. You can find the above description, at the Marrakesh, which has been a fixture on Paradise rd., when other eateries have come and gone at this good central location for both tourists and local alike.

There is nothing more enticing and enjoying than watching beautiful belly dancers and eating lamb kebab under the spell of red wine. This place is not only a sight for sore eyes but a delight for you palate. The best days are Friday and Saturday nights, when the belly dancers are practicing Turkish Navel Manueavers !

As far as I know there is no other Moroccan place in Las Vegas. The  food which is a six course meal is authentic with subtle spicing and the lamb kebabs (kebab is Persian fantasy, that spread to Turkey and the Balkan countries like Greece etc) is just the most delicious perfect morsel of meat  I have ever eaten (the only other place is Mad Greek Cafe on Sahara and Durango)  You are seated in a Moroccan tent on divans, cross legged and relaxed with not a worry in the world .The wine will take you into a state of fantasy of being a Sheik with your own harem! . 

I like  this place....I really really like this place-if I can borrow  little elation from Sally Fields-at the Oscars."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so fun and the food is delicious! Be sure to call ahead and make reservations just in case. We walked in for a party of 2 and thank goodness they were able to accommodate us. There was sooo much food, so go hungry. The price was about $45 per person and it was well worth it! The dessert... Omg. I had plenty leftovers too. Oh and don't forget to bring a few extra bucks to tip the bell dancer :)."}
{"text":"I brought my in-laws here for dinner. It was their very first time at a Moroccan restaurant. I could see their hesitation in coming as they are very accustomed to eating Chinese food every day. Low and behold-it was a GREAT experience. The belly dancer was beautiful and had great moves. She was the only one tonight, but captivated everyone in the room.

As for the food, I wish it was better. I honestly was a bit disappointed in the food. It's not my first time at a Moroccan restaurant and in the past have always been pleased with all the food. This time, however, was different. Although the food was good, it was nothing spectacular (it's my first time at this restaurant).

Ranking for good to bad (or not so great)-

Shrimp Scampi
Soup
Beef Kebab
B'Stilla
Hummus & Eggplant Dip
Chicken Couscous (where's the flavor? Forget to add salt?)

Not sure if I'd come back here. Perhaps that's just me comparing my previous experiences at other restaurants and this night. For those who haven't ever been to a Moroccan restaurant, it's definitely worth a go, as I believe everyone should try everything at least once. If you don't like it, then don't go back.

{"text":"Just wow!! What a great place to spend an evening. Great Mediterranean food, non smoking environment (no hookah), beautiful music and drop gorgeous belly dancers who are very friendly and invite you to dance with them. We had a great time. Too bad it closed early. Other than that it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. A bit pricey for type of food - hence only 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a four (it should really be a 3 1/2) mostly for service and entertainment. This is a great place for group dinners and get togethers. The belly dancers are great fun especially when they get you into the action. 

The food is just ok. So, go in with low expectations. :) The quantities are large and pretty good, just not great. Dessert was my favorite part of the meal. Definitely a treat. It's pretty expensive, so definitely a special occasion type place."}
{"text":"We had an awesome time here for our anniversary.  I booked the restaurant about a month ahead of time in order to make sure we could get in.  I had heard from a couple of friends that Marrakech was not to be missed, and they were right.  Marrakech Moroccan Restaurant was everything they had mentioned plus more!

I have never been to Morocco, but I imagine that Marrakech gives a good representation of the cuisine in that country.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with tapestries, inlaid tables, low to the ground couches, and gorgeous belly dancers!!  They encourage you to eat with your fingers which is the traditional Moroccan way (although silverware is available if requested).  I have absolutely no problem with eating with my hands cause that is the traditional Filipino way also!  Before partaking of the six course meal, they wash your hands with rose water.

The six course meal is the same menu for everyone.  With the exception being a vegetarian menu for those who request it.  All of the courses tasted very good.  Starting from course #1 which was shrimp scampi all the way to course #6 which was the dessert.  The dessert is a Moroccan pastry called b'stilla.  It is a yummy concotion of chocolate, banana, & nuts all inside the pastry.  It was a perfect end to the meal.  

The entertainment was the highlight of the evening at the restaurant.  Those belly dancers are fabulous.  They came out to dance twice during our time there.  Of course, I had to entertain the patrons also.  They had me do my belly dancing with them as well.  I must say that they put me to shame, but I got a loud applause (at least I think the applause was for me).  My wife loved my dancing, and I got to burn off some calories which is always a good thing!!  

I highly recommend that you visit here if you're in Las Vegas.  The location is not far from the Strip.  The ambiance, service, and entertainment are top notch and worth 5 stars.  The six course meal is 4.5 stars and costs $40 per person.  I could not quite give them 5 stars for the food because I'm just not a real big couscous fan.  Although, my wife really enjoyed it.  Our time at Marrakech was truly a memorable and wonderful experience.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  It would be terrific if they would offer a couple of other options for their prixe-fixe menu.  I'd love to taste other Morrocan delicacies on our next visit.  With that being said, just go here and check them out for yourself!  If not for the scrumptious food, then for the beautiful belly dancers!!"}
{"text":"if youve never been to this place you gotta try it! We eat here every time we go to Vegas. The atmosphere is great and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went here a long while ago but we still talk about this restaurant !! I'm going to send my parents here for their next trip to vegas. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was really nice. The bellydancing adds a nice touch. But save room for dessert ! I still salivate thinking about that fruit pastry they serve at the end with the mint tea. I can't seem to find it anywhere else ! MUST GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a unique dining experience. To be tried at least once in your lifetime! 

AMBIANCE: The place is very dimmed, set for a pretty lightly lit romantic meal. Everything inside was fit for the Moroccan theme. The music was great as well. The tables were a bit small and low, while the booths were higher. When eating, you have to lean down more than I would have liked. 

SERVICE: You eat with your fingers, so they actually rinse your hands with rose water. The rose water made my hands smell so good! The belly dancer was very entertaining, she would come out once every 30 minutes or so. We came in and were seated right away. The waiter was very very nice, made our experience all the better. Make sure if you choose to eat here, that you have a several hours, because this meal takes some time. It's not meant to be a quick meal.  

FOOD: A bit disappointing. You are given a $45 pre-fix 6 course meal. We had a restaurant.com voucher that we used, which made the meal more affordable. The food was very interesting. 
1. Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi wasn't too authentic, it tasted like a normal shrimp scampi, but it was good. Even better with the bread because the scampi was a bit on the saltier side, but this might have been one of the better dishes.  
2. I really enjoyed the Harira (lentil) soup, but my bf did not. 
3. Marrakech Sample was a good refresher dish. Fresh cucumber, carrots, olives and hummus/zaaluk. The zaaluk I didn't enjoy because it was bitter. The hummus was just like any normal original hummus. 
4. Beef Brochette (kabob) was very nicely presented, on a pineapple. My bf really enjoyed the kebabs. I thought it wasn't too bad either, I would have liked it more if the meat was juicier, not so dry.   
5. When the Royal Moroccan CousCous Platter with Djaj came out, we were already feeling pretty stuffed! This was probably my least favorite dish, though I LOVE couscous... 
6. B'stilla dessert was interesting. Like a large flaky chocolate and banana pastry. We could not finish it, had to take it home, but that wasnt a good idea because it was no longer crispy. We also had enough leftovers for lunch the next day for the two of us!  
7. Mint Tea was interesting. Good combination with the very sweet dessert."}
