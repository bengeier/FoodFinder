{"text":"I just came back from visiting Montreal and I happened to stop by this small restaurant. I tried the wonton soup and dumplings and it was so delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant, the service was outstanding and I will definitely be back. Thank you so much for everything!"}
{"text":"This is a new Chinese restaurant, there are a variety of noodles and fried rice to sell, as well as wonton, spring rolls, dumplings. Last time I ordered a wonton with shrimp in chicken soup. It was very delicious. Today i ordered a noodle soup. The taste is the same as in China, letting me find the taste of the home. The madam in the resturant was very nice. I will come again to try fried rice and beaf and pork dumplings."}

{"text":"This place has authentic homemade food flavours from Szechuan. Love their dumplings, it's oozing with flavours from the pork fillings and it's juice from the steamed veggie mix inside. Their dipping sauce is hot but not overwhelming. Their sambay chicken is delicious. It's perfumed with a light spice and the egg on top brings another level of creaminess which help tie in the dish. The beef soup is yummy! The noodles are  perfectly cooked and has a nice chew. The beef briskets were surprisingly tender and tasty. This reminds me of moms cooking.  The owner is very nice. They just opened a few months ago. You definitely  get your bang for your buck. I will come back."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in this neighborhood! Very authentic and good quantity! The hostess is very nice as well!"}
