{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. The house chicken is AMAZING. I also recommend the BBQ baby back ribs. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I went there today to try a lunch special. Got vegetables and fried tofu and it was amazing! Got it to go and it was piping hot and delicious when I got home. Lots of tofu, tons of good rice."}
{"text":"We're a big fan of Dragon Bowl.  You can find this treasure tucked away in the corner of the old Vons shopping center at Decatur and Lone Mountain next to the Ace Hardware. We've tried the Hong Kong Seafood Combo, one of the specialties of the house, and were blown away by the crisp, delicately breaded pieces of a white fish, krab, shrimp (40 count) and *gasp* moist sea scallops, all with just the right amount of heavy garlic. Yum. The crispy beef is one of a kind in this city, not found elsewhere, and Chef will gladly bump up the heat on request.  Come here to compare.  Mixed vegetables are always fresh with the best sauce.  Love the spring rolls. So much more to explore."}
{"text":"Great lunch prices and you get a lot of food.  Also when I came in they were playing classic rock. Great lunch place I couldn't be happier :)"}
{"text":"Great food, I ordered the orange chicken and white rice. It was hot and not soggy and the rice was perfect.  The waiter was prompt and very helpful. The only downside is the tables were dirty."}
{"text":"Some of the food was good, and some of it was not so good. But what stood out most was the service...and NOT in a good way.  Our server was eating her dinner at a table when we walked into the completely empty restaurant. We were seated and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I ordered hot tea and was told they were out of it. Odd for a Chinese restaurant to be out of hot tea, but, ok.  We ordered an appetizer and before we were done our entrees came out. Which was fine, except our server wouldn't let us keep the app plate on the table and wanted us to take what was left and put it on our dinner plates. Ok.  So after we finished our entrees, we still had some food left. The server brought over a few styrofoam boxes. I asked if we could have a few more because we wanted to split the food. Apparently this offended her and she rolled her eyes, huffed and stalked off to get more boxes.  When she returned, I was scooping food into one of the boxes. As I sat there with a spoon of food above the plate, she picked the plate up and slid the rest of the food into my box, picked up my dinner plate, put it in a pile and rudely asked if I was done. As I sat there, shocked, still holding a spoon of food above a now empty stack of plates, I said \"I guess I don't have a choice!\" What was suppose to be a fun annual Chinese dinner with my best friend, left me with stomach cramps, aggravation and a crazy story to tell!"}
{"text":"My bf and I are new to Phoenix. After the 3rd night of pizza during the unpacking, we decided to find some chinese. Found Dragon Bowl off Zomato and went, I'm confident in saying this will be our go to place for chinese food!! Decent sized portions, reasonably priced and so very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for 15% off so we thought we'd try it. BBQ pork slices had, um, BBQ sauce on it. I mean like Kraft brand. Needless to say, didn't like that. The Dragon Bowl spicy chicken was not too bad. Mostly onions though. Other half had the orange chicken. Orange chicken was okay. Once had it where they added orange marmalade as a sauce. This was sweet but not as sweet as that one was. Not spicy enough but most orange chicken isn't even if the menus always say it is a spicy dish. Sigh."}
{"text":"really good food delivery guy can be a lil slow but it's not a complaint as food has never arrived cold or nothing like that bout 35 for 2 dishes And 2 Rice's all delicious we order regularly never any issue +1"}
{"text":"Super impressed with the sweet and sour chicken! Will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"So, this place is great! I have eaten in a couple times, but I order for delivery at least once a week. Over the last few years, I have gotten to know this family, and I know how much they put into their restaurant. I think I have gotten just about everything off the menu, and tonight I ordered the Thai Basil Tofu. Now I'm not big into tofu, but this was excellent. I will be ordering that again soon. I have had them cater a birthday, and everyone loved the food.   If you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"I love Dragon Bowl The owner and I got along really well. I love House chow fun fried shrimp , next time I will try the  Roasting Duck."}
{"text":"Piping hot and on time delivery.  I'm usually not a fan of take-out because I don't like lukewarm or cold food, but this place did not disappoint.  I literally had to blow on my fried rice it was so hot!  We ordered the Beef and Broccoli main course, with a side of Chicken Fried Rice, and potstickers.  The total was $33 (not including tip) which I thought was very reasonable since the portions are huge!!  It is at least 2 meals for my husband and I.  The potstickers tasted really good as well as the sauce that comes with them.   I typically like my potstickers more crispy, and these were softer but still awesome.  Some places just cook them differently!  The fried rice portion has a ton of egg and white chicken which I loved.  The beef & broccoli and was also very good, pretty typical chinese food, nothing crazy different or out of the ordinary.   We were quoted 35 minutes over the phone and it came pretty much right on time.   Will definitely do their takeout again!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food. My wife and I were actually just pasting by, and we decided to try it out. We walked in and the whole restaurant was full, we waited a while to get seats. However it was worth it, the food was great. Delicious!! Also the service was great. We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Seemed like a pretty typical Chinese restaurant. The young lady (high school age?) that seated us was especially friendly and eager to seat us and bring us drinks. Ambiance was nice. Food was served in fairly large portions and good as well. $8-9 for a dinner plate. My fortune cookie had a Chinese saying - no fortune. Bummer. :|"}
{"text":"Dragon Bowl has such CONSISTANTLY FANTASTIC Chinese food!  The pork fried rice, sesame chicken, and soups are always so tasty, along with everything I've ever ordered there! Great service with a smile, & you receive a great amount of food with very wonderful prices!  It's the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the 1st time. I have to say I really liked it. The crab Rangoon were very large. I ordered the Orange chicken dinner combo. Very good flavor, though I would have liked it to have been more spicier. Lo Mein was great. And the egg rolls were delicious. We just recently moved to this area and I think I found the spot for our Chinese delivery nights. Looking forward to trying more menu items."}
{"text":"We decided to go here since we got a coupon in Valpak or Moneymailer (not sure which one). We drove up and we're unsure about the place by outside appearance, but when we got inside we felt much better about the place. For a thursday night, there were multiple other couples dining-in as well as a delivery boy constantly heading in and right back out again. We were nicely greeted and seated quickly. We looked over the menu and knew immediately what we wanted - the dinner specials. They seemed like such a good deal and they were! My husband got Kung Pao Chicken and I the Orange Chicken. Both were marked as spicy on the menu and neither had much spice but that didn't matter much to us. If you're looking for spice, ask for more! Both items were very flavorful, chicken was good (not chewy or weird...like other restaurants) and the rice and noodles were amazing too! I'm not too sure about the egg roll, but that's just a small side to everything else that is so delicious. Also, we got an order of the crab puffs which were amazing!  We will definitely be going here again. Great food, great service, and a nice environment too.  We didn't read any previous reviews, but after reading some, I would recommend eating in."}
{"text":"I was searching for some place to eat. I checked my map and Dragon Bowl was on the list of nearby places. I recently had a terrible experience with what I thought was a good teriyaki chicken restaurant so I was skeptical. I decided to try it out while hoping for the best outcome. The hostess was friendly and attended to me immediately. I ordered the Orange Chicken w/ White Rice. To my surprise the service was fast, the plate of Orange Chicken was very presentable and it was enough food for two people, except it was only I. The Orange Chicken actually has the flavor of Orange unlike other places that serve the same dish. I'm very pleased with the environment, the service and the food.  PS, if the rice is okay at a \"Chinese\" restaurant then soy sauce is my best friend,  please note I did not use one drop of soy sauce while eating my Orange Chicken meal tonight."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese place. The one by my house closed down and I went looking for a new spot. Found this one and it does not disappoint. The actual inside could use some work but the food is always good"}
{"text":"Very good!! 2nd best hot & sour soup I've ever had (first is Abacus Inn)! No complaints with this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place here in AZ! A little pricey, but I'll pay extra for this amazing quality. I LOVE that they deliver, and they are usually super quick. Wonderful customer service, and an overall great Chinese Food place. I highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"New management has put together a vast menu.  Three of us greatly enjoyed our meals (yui shan shrimp, shrimp w vegs, sweet sour pork).  All delicious. Dining room looks cleaner.   Restrooms better too. We will be back. Hopefully they'll have a little more help."}
{"text":"This place sucks,I ordered chow mein and got gross stuff,at least they gave us free soda. Everything was pretty disgusting. Never again"}
{"text":"If want a list of place to stay away. this is one of them. I think my one star tell you how I feel about this pit."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered delivery. Recommend the Yushan eggplant and veggie lo mein!"}
{"text":"This is really the best tasting Chinese food that I've had yet in Las Vegas.  The food here is never bland or greasy like at many other Chinese places and really tastes fresh and special.  The hot and sour soup is so good that I find myself craving it whenever I think about it!  Another great dish is the Hong Kong seafood special.   The interior of the restaurant is perfectly clean, with about 10 dine-in tables, or you can also order take away.   The location is a bit hidden, in a strip mall on Decatur, on the NW corner of Lone Mountain.   Mmm, I'm wishing for a bowl of their soup now !  :-)"}
{"text":"Restaurant was the best chinese food I've very had. My waitress Rebecca was absolutely the best. Everyone looking for awesome chinese food go here."}
{"text":"Great food ,great service ,great price. Portions are large and had plenty of leftovers to bring home. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese food, cozy, it can get pretty busy at night as the place is small and it looks like a family owned and run business, so be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"We just moved to this area and we were trying to find a good Chinese food we went to four places before trying here and we went based on the yelp reviews and they were right this place was really good very reasonable on price and we've been going since"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in all of NorPho!  We get this all the time and they do such a great job! Their food is super good and they will deliver! Staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place while waiting for a prescription @ the CVS down the street. We should have gone to DQ instead. I had the Yui-Shan Shrimp which was terrible. A flavorless sauce with tons of mushy green peppers and a few bamboo shoots sprinkled throughout. My wife had the Kung Pao Shrimp, which tasted like ketchup and soy sauce, there was no pao to be had. The egg roll was the best part, and only because it was packed with black pepper did it have any taste. We split an order of crab puffs, which were so tiny and overcooked there was maybe one small bite from each piece. The table setting was outrageous! Cloth napkins and delicately placed flowers gave me the sense that the Queen Mother was coming for a visit at any time. I politely paid the bill and left a tip, and will NEVER return there."}
{"text":"I must say that I am shocked to see such bad reviews for this place.  The house chicken was wonderful, and the double cooked chicken my wife ordered was pretty good.  For 50 cents more per plate you get wontons and a very large egg roll.  The staff was very polite and attentive.  The fried rice was interesting (rice and soy sauce) and okay but only okay.  which is cause for only a 4 star rating.  My wife and I both enjoyed our meals thoroughly and had to box up more than half our meals and we got out of there for less than 20.00 before tip.  I will definitely try a few more dishes from this establishment."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Beware when ordering they will not even attempt to correct there mistake! I ordered the shrimp and vegetable dinner combination. To my surprise when my food arrived it was just shrimp and vegetables not the combination. I called the store back, explained the problem, and told them I would pay for a full size fried and egg rolls ( to match my huge potion of shrimp and veggies). The girl on the line said it was no problem that they wouldn't charge me. About 3 min later a women with a heavy accent called and explained that I did not say I wanted a combination and they are too busy to come back. I was so appalled! I barely knew what to say! Too busy to come back and correct there mistake, especially when I offered to pay for it?! I ended up ordering from another place and will never order from this shop again. I would give them 0 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I love this place a lot! I eat here all the time and it is always consistent. All the employees are nice, welcoming and quick. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to give this place a try and I loved it! Was so happy they had egg drop soup and it was the best I've ever had I pretty much crave it everyday now! Loved that they put carrots, peas, and chestnuts, most places don't. My boyfriend got his fav, sweet and sour with sauce on the side and it was amazing! Came with a bunch of rice and noodles for only like $8. I got the soup, potstickers, crab puffs, and egg rolls. Pot stickers were really good and the soy sauce had seasoning in it which made it so much better! The crab puffs were the best I've ever had, ate them cold later that day and they were still amazing! Came with warm sweet and sour which was another plus, had to take the rest home with me too! The only thing I didn't really like was the eggrolls it was all cabbage and I expected some other veggies like carrots and such, they weren't bad just not my favorite. Other than that everything was great the inside was cute and the waiter was nice! Definitely a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery and have never been disappointed. This place is my go to for Chinese food. The chicken curry is one of my favorite dishes, not too spicy with a ton of white meat chicken and vegetables.  Try the summer rolls. They are as big as burritos."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 20 years! They recently just switch ownership about 2 years ago. If you don't spend a lot of money they will treat you like s***! The food is great, but if they are busy they are very rude. The other day I ordered just some soup from them and I was treated like a second class citizen. Again they only treat you well if you spend a lot of money. I ordered ahead of time over the phone and the girl hung up on me, and when I got there my order was not ready. I waited an additional 30 minutes for them to put soup in a cup for me. They asked me 3 times what kind of soup I ordered while I was there waiting and acted like I was an inconvenience to them. They really have no idea how to treat people."}
{"text":"There must be another word for the food, but YUCK will have to do.  The wonton soup had no flavor and mushy wontons.  The shrimp with lobster sauce had some kind of brown sauce and, again, mushy shrimp.  Even the fried rice had both a peculiar flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!   Tonight was my first time here (it's pretty new) I didn't expect much as we were just passing by and it was the only non-fast food in eye-shot. But boy were we surprised!   We had War Wonton Soup to start, very flavorful. Not your typical bland broth with overcooked floaters. Yum.   Entrees were chicken with green bean, shrimp fried rice and orange chicken for the kids. To my surprise the orange chicken was really tasty! The green beans were ok, cooked well but lacking much flavor. But the chicken in that dish was delicious.  Fried rice came out and I was instantly taken to China Town (San Francisco of course) the smell of blackened wok filled the dining room and I got excited. The rice did not disappoint. All together everything was excellent.   Fifth star could have been earned by a cleaner bathroom and more reasonable pricing.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here at least once a month. Amazing prices for a ton of food. The food is always great, no complaints at all. We will continue to go as often as we can"}
{"text":"For Chinese take out, this is probably the best option in the area. Portion sizes are huge for the price (especially the burrito sized summer rolls). We've only ordered delivery and the food always arrives on time if not early."}
{"text":"Really.  Visited tonight for the first time.  Clean, no nonsense, fresh hot food!  Better egg rolls than pei wei and some yummy crab pops!  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our selves potstickers, crab puffs, S&P pork chops(killer) and  walnut shrimp, BBQ pork Fried (OK)... We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is addicting! I got the crab puffs, calamari, and orange chicken. The portions are huge! The food is excellent and service is fast. Dragon Bowl is my go to spot for chinese food!"}
{"text":"This little family owned Chinese restaurant is great, we have had, Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Kung Pau Chicken, Pad Tai, Egg Flower soup, crab rolls, egg rolls , and more. Everything's wonderful! And, they deliver! It is our favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years even when they were over across the street at the other location. The place is a great joint for fast fresh and good food. We get it to go and enjoy the food at home. We have also ate in the restaurant numerous times and it's great . No long wait and food is really good. Thanks for keeping this place a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese! Great food, great flavor, great deals.  I recommend the egg rolls, lo mein and garlic chicken."}
{"text":"Elderly aunt wanted Chinese food, not Pac-Rim.  Checked Yelp for the area and glad I did!  Went for weekday lunch. Very busy,  clean, and friendly! Very busy for  take-out. Aunt had Cashew Chicken. I had Kung Pao. Also had an order of lettuce wraps.   Both entrées were very good.  If you're a lover of \"that other place's\" lettuce wraps, then those found here are very different. Not bad, just different.  All for $24 plus tip, and aunt took home the lettuce wrap chicken with rice plus half her entree. Looking forward to returning with husband for a dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Recent home delivery was a horrible experience from beginning to end. Girl taking order was not friendly and in a hurry which led to mistakes on our order. Tried to tell me my coupon was for dine-in only, when it was not. Delivery guy did nothing more than grunt at me when I asked simple questions, so I just signed the receipt and tipped him. Food was awful. Kung Pao Shrimp no peanuts came with peanuts and 5 small shrimp with a ton of celery, and water chestnuts. Crab Puffs were almost flat, more like fried won tons. My wife's chow mein was loaded with bamboo, and I believe they use MSG, because although I threw away 80% of my dinner, I still felt miserable for the rest of the night. I am a Pesca-Vegetarian and I know when I have eaten something my body does not like, right away. Never again"}
{"text":"Incredibly expensive and it took a hour and a half to get it to my door. Then once we got it we found out that they dont deliver won ton soup for take out but its on their menu! Then the food was yuck! I have had allot of Chinese food in my 44 years! This has to be the worst!  I gave one star just cause we did not get sick!  But short of that I would give zero stars if I could. That's how bad the food and the service was."}
{"text":"They have deliciousfood. The large portions are much appreciated & the establishment is modern & clean which helps me feel better about not cooking at home. I also love that I can understand them over the phone. I'm not racist!- just slightly hearing impaired over the phone"}
{"text":"Really good family spot... been there a few times so decided to leave a review finally. It's around the corner from where I live so we go there a lot. It's definitely not your New York chineese food but it will do to fix the crave. Really good wonton soup and the rice is amazing not too hard or mushy just perfect. Service is not bad but I guess it depends on who you get again they are family. Enjoy all the food on the menu... it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"If you are searching for awesome Chinese, this is not the place. You are better off at Panda Express or pf changs. One star for delivery, and one star for fast service. 0 for food.. We ordered orange chicken because the reviews said it was the best in Phoenix, fried rice, and lo mein.   Orange chicken was extremely dry inside, almost as if the chicken was frozen and it was microwaved.   Fried rice was undercooked.  Lo mein was over cooked. The noodles were soggy and unenjoyable.  We will definitely be looking elsewhere for better Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"Good portion size, some dishes definitely better than others. Known to be a hole in the wall with meh service, but the food is good and decently priced if you aren't trying to cook your own."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the lettuce wraps. A full set of fresh ingredients are brought to the table along including LEAN chicken with water chestnuts, the good kind of rice - lumpy, and hoisin sauce. Do not be afraid to ask for more hoisin sauce.  Under a family ownership and management, the restaurant makes an unbelievably good lunch and dinner at reasonable prices with friendly and unique service. The most adorable little cashier counted back perfect change to me just the other day (with her mother's supervision, of course).   I moved to the neighborhood in 2008 and was instantly addicted to Dragon Bowl. Their flavors are definitely more on the mild side than spicy but they are respectfully traditional. The prices are a tad higher but so is the price of a gallon of gasoline since 2008 so, ya know, how cares?   It's worth it plus gratuity on most occasions."}
{"text":"Used to go here years ago and the old management got a little cheap on portions size. Not anymore. The place has really turned around and food tastes great! Good bang for the buck on portion size. Egg drop soup is great! Since we rediscovered the Dragon Bowl, we haven't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in North Phoenix! They use fresh ingredients and always have their oil for frying clean so it tastes perfect. We love their Sweet and Sour Shrimp. So good!"}
{"text":"The egg drop soup is delicious, as is the house chicken. The serving sizes are generous. The inevitable swollen fingers the next day? Worth it."}
{"text":"I thought the fried rice was good until I got a mouth full of eggshells. Really disappointed. I've never had that happen before. How do you get a whole broken up eggshell in your rice. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Another successful delivery order - the Hot & Sour soup had shrimp in it!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place for the first time a few days ago and I was very pleased by their quick delivery and great portion size for the price. You can also expect a very delicious meal- I was so surprised that the food was so delicious, definitely will consider getting delivery from this place than any other pizza joint."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviews! This place has excellent food for a very cheap price! They're always really nice when I come in and I've enjoyed every dish I've had from here. If you're looking for a big meal with little cost, this is the place to go! I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch combo, which was only about $6.95. It came with HUGE portions of chicken and fried rice, a nice size egg roll, and 2 wontons. Before I moved, this was my go to Chinese place, but I still will be coming here a lot when I visit the valley."}
{"text":"A nice to place to stop and have lunch or dinner. It's a small family run establishment with a nice menu, good variety. Food is always served hot and consistently prepared. They have lunch and dinner combos and have takeout.  Best hot and sour soup in North Phoenix.  Just a good place for asian cuisine at a good price."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from Dragon Bowl several times now and they continue to offer delicious and consistent Chinese food. They always have my order ready when I arrive and the food is always piping hot, even by the time I get it home. Absolutely one of the better Chinese food restaurants in Moon Valley, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food really wasn't good when I went.  I can get a better meal at Panda for less money."}
{"text":"TLDR: the food was decent, price was very good and I will be back.  The critiques that follow are more as points for improvement, not meant to sway your decision to dine here negatively.   I had an order of crash puffs and the lunch cashew chicken with egg flower soup.  The crab puffs were fresh, hot and definitely made to order.  The order included 8 very large puffs.  However it was far more cream cheese than crab.  I wish it had about a third less cream cheese and three times the crab as any crab flavor was buried.  The soup was good, pretty standard though.  The egg roll was okay, though if it weren't included with the meal, I wouldn't order them separately.  The cashew chicken was very good.  It was well prepared and cooked.  I do wish it had even a hint more acid to it, the flavor was fairly muted.  Overall, I'm happy with my lunch, which was under $15 for the lunch special, an order of crab puffs and a fountain drink.  It's a decent place for fast Chinese food.  I came in because it's near my work and had some decent reviews... I tend to rate based on category and price, for what it is, and relatively cheap at lunch it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was never reimbursed, this place is terrible and the manager is rude. I did a previous review a while back. I stated they reimbursed me but that never happened."}
{"text":"First time at Dragon Bowl. Killing time before meeting friends so I thought I'd grab a lunch special. I was seated right away and offered my drink selection. There were four other parties but one was a table of 12. The two servers were hopping, trying to keep up.   The server took my order right away: Orange Chicken Special which comes with soup, fried egg roll, two wontons, rice and the entree, for $6.35  The Hot and Sour soup was very good. Very hearty with lots of veggies. The Egg Roll was actually very good. Crispy shell, fresh veggies and good flavor. The Fried Rice was sad. No flavor even tho it was fried. The Wontons were seriously over cooked. The Orange Chicken was also lacking. It had pronounced orange notes and a little heat but the breading was terrible: glossy and flavorless.   Their friendly staff and cheap prices will get them thru but this guy won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid 5-Star.  Food was quick and tasted great.  Had the War Wonton and sweet n sour chicken.  Customizing a meal is welcomed."}
{"text":"Great food. My friend and I ordered for pickup and got home and realized he ordered the wrong thing and hated it. I called back to order the correct dish and they didn't even charge me or ask any questions when I came back for it. I come here often with family and we will continue to come. Food is better when eaten there of course but great little place. Thanks dragon bowl"}
{"text":"We just had awesome take-out from Dragon Bowl. Tried the Yui Shan Shrimp, so delicious, a little hot spice but not too much, lots of stir fried veggies. Loved it! Also we shared pork fried rice, we still have leftovers. It was amazing, thank you Dragon Bowl!"}
{"text":"From the very beginning this place rocks. The service is genuinely friendly. It's super clean. The prices are actually very low. The portions are huge and the flavor is superb.  Five stars all the way!  You really should try it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and seriously needed some good delivery/takeout after moving all day! Found this place on yelp and it was awesome! We had delivery. The person who took our order was friendly and efficient. Our food arrived well before their estimate and was still hot! The food was really good! We had sweet and sour chicken, egg fried rice, beef with black bean sauce, and crab puffs. The crab puffs were awesome! My chicken was very good, right amount of breading and the sauce was tasty! My husband really enjoyed his beef! Fried rice was pretty standard, but good. I wish they had a veggie fried rice, as the egg just has carrots and peas. This will be our go to Chinese from now on!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly, service that was attentive to our needs. Lunch specials are awesome with many choices. The soups are really good and the fried shrimp appetizer was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing! We tried it for the first time and will definatly be back!!! The kung pao chicken was as spicey as I had hoped, but flavor was there! Teriyaki chicken hit the spot for adults and kids!!!! Fried rice was spot on and the crab puffs were huge and delicious! Best part, the home made hot mustard, WOW, seriously best I've ever had!! Staff was friendly and thanked us many times! Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Portion is full, taste is ok and this place is clean, waiters here are also helpful so highly recommend especially in their special hour since price is pretty decent"}
{"text":"Fast delivery and good food! I ordered from Dragon Bowl on August 7th, 2015. I ordered at 4:30pm and in ten minutes the delivery girl zoomed over wearing a Superman shirt! :D I had the sweet n sour chicken, egg fried rice and crab puffs. Contrary to a few reviews on here, I wasn't overcharged, which is a good thing. The sweet n sour chicken was yummy, as were the veggies that came with it. I was so full that I had leftovers. The egg fried rice was pretty good. The crab puffs were okay. I would definitely order from them again if I'm in North Phoenix again. :)"}
{"text":"This place has been around for decades. I've always gone here for lunch or take-out. I usually get the house fried rice, house chicken, and egg drop soup. I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews of this place. I've only ever had positive experiences myself."}
{"text":"We have ordered off of the delivery menu twice. Both times I ordered dinner for 6 people. The person taking the order knew exactly what I was asking for and they delivered exactly what we asked for. The food was hot, fresh and very tasty. Well, if we ordered twice it must have been or we would not have we ordered the second time... We are very happy with the food, prices, service and delivery. They will be getting our business until they change something."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout today and got the green bean and chicken with white rice. So yummy. The food was made so quickly and tastes great!!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't good, but wasn't bad. I want to rate it higher because the service and delivery was awesome and they were very friendly. Also, sent me a free 2 liter of Pepsi, which I thought was nice."}
{"text":"This place has become our new favorite Chinese delivery. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced and with one exception, their deliveries have been very prompt. The wings are amazing, the chicken fried rice has lots of chicken, everything we've tried has been fantastic! If you're looking for a good Chinese delivery spot in this area, Dragon Bowl is great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for Chinese food near by that delivered. We tried this place tonight and we couldn't be happier. We got three different entrees and all were amazing. The vegetable lo main was delicious and not to even mention the crab puffs. My god those were perfect. Definitely recommend to everyone. Delivery was quick too."}
{"text":"Great spot! Huge portions, hot and sour soup best I've had in a while. I recommend the Mongolian Beef, ask for it spicy! Kung Pao chicken is great too."}
{"text":"I took out several different dishes. I took home ultra large portions that were better than from most of the local Chinese Restaurants near me.The Chicken in the dishes were cooked especially well and all the dishes included nicely cooked crisp fresh vegetables.   One of the different dishes I took home was Spicy Rock cod with black bean sauce. The fish actually seemed fresh and was cooked nicely. The vegetables in the dish were fresh and crispy.I thought this was an unusual for take out from a Chinese Restaurant and I liked that.    The spicy basil tofu lacked fresh basil....I thought I'd enjoy this dish but it was undeveloped with very dry dead basil.   I also took out Thai Curry Chicken. I do NOTE that the chicken was cooked very nicely and ABOVE AVERGE... but the curry was very weak to me..... This dish didn't seem like Thai in any way to me but I'm not Thai so I can't say for sure.  If I could I would give 3.5 stars stars because the chicken here was prepared above average for the Chinese restaurants I've been to near this area. Portions from take out were CRAZY large and also very sloppy and messy in package. They do pack too much food in the styrofoam  package so Bring a TOWEL.  Overall a pretty decent place to visit when in the area. They do offer many different dishes that you won't find at other Chinese Restaurants.  Worthy of a try.  Giant size take out portions and juicy succulent chicken. Watch out for leakage with take out."}
{"text":"If you need a great place for Chinese Food omg! This is the place ! Just perfect home made Chinese food! Take out too! What is not to love"}
{"text":"I've only had the chow mein w/shrimp & chicken wings, take out, twice, but both times I've been very pleased with it. It's been better than most Chinese takeout I've had. The price is a little bit higher, but your portion is a little bit more and the quality is better. I'm a little disappointed because they give the lazy version of the crispy noodles. The kind you can find in the grocery store in the big bag. And the chicken wings are over breaded. Kind of like a beer batter, but much crispier, but still tasty. Overall, it was worth the $18.00."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great. Rice wasn't cooked right and had little flavor. Chicken smelled good,but didn't taste all that great. Could have used more sauce and veggies. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"While this food did not make me Kim Jong Il by any means and I don't particularly LIKE Chinese even....steer clear of this place. This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;)  Oh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch. FYI."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick lunch, take out or delivery Dragon Bowl is a good choice  The Dining area  is small but quiet and staff is very professional. Dragon Bowl offers  excellent lunch prices and generous servings.  The sweet snd sour chicken was good, egg roll had lots of vegetables. My meal could easily be two meals.   Good price, food, and service ."}
{"text":"This is our favorite take out place! They have great lunch and dinner combos and are always packed! Still you get your food pretty fast, when ordering take out they'll tell you about 15 minutes and it'll be ready. My favorite is the bbq pork fried rice, beef broccoli, house chicken and husband loves the orange chicken. Spring rolls are great too. When dining in expect good service also. We go here all the time so decided I should finally write a review"}
{"text":"New owners it looks like. Not nearly as good as it used to be! We were greatly disappointed when we went to eat in the restaurant last week. Oolong tea was just hot water."}
{"text":"Seriously! Ever since moving from Cali to AZ I could never find a good Chinese Restaurant! This place is by far the BEST! Their shrimp fried rice is so DELISH! Tons of JUMBO Shrimp! Yum!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in No. Phoenix for delivery. Food is constantly hot, fresh, not greasy-delish!"}
{"text":"Horrible first time experience. Food came in super soggy, I ordered two chicken meals both had no flavor. I also ordered chow mein and got a bunch of drenched veggies with NO NOODLES?? I even got a fortune cookie with no fortune? Seriously guys? Never ordering again. Thanks anyway."}
{"text":"This place is right near me and I have never popped in here. However, today I broke that streak. I was looking for a decent Chinese place by my house. All the other I found except for Pei Wei suck Turkey nostrils.  To my surprise, this place was quaint and cute. Run by a mother and her kids, they pump it out for the small group that they are. The menu is your typical staple of Chinese food.  All I can say is this, it's clean, the food and portion size are ample and the service is very accommodating.   Next store is a Russian deli that is a trip to check out all of their goods. Down towards the end of the plaza is a water shop that sells Thrifty Ice Cream. FLASHBACK!!!! Great stuff!   The place is solid for a bite! So, if your in the hood, come and check them out..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here for dinner.  The lady on the phone had trouble understanding my address and despite repeating my credit card # back to me she apparently didn't run the charge through because the girl who delivered the food was expecting payment when she got here.  They had a heck of a time sorting it out and ended up needing my card # again.  I'm a little nervous about what they did with it when they wrote it down the first time.  The delivery girl was very nice though.  The food was mediocre.  We ordered dinner combos.  I got sweet and sour pork and my husband got teriyaki chicken.  The combos come with fried wontons, eggrolls, fried rice, and lo mien.  The egg rolls were horrible but I liked the fried wontons.  My husband said the lo mien is better than Panda Express (I agree) but the teriyaki chicken was not better than Panda Express.  The sweet and sour sauce was good but on delivery orders they should leave the sauce on the side so the breading on the pork doesn't get mushy.  If you order an order of fried rice it's a lot better than the stuff that comes with the combo.  Overall the food was ok but it's not something I would order again."}
{"text":"No flavor,  rice was so dry it fell everywhere.  Food did not taste fresh. The people hyping this place up must have not had good Chinese food before."}
{"text":"If you are considering trying this place, don't!  Went for lunch and the egg drop soup had no flavor.  The Won Tons tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  The egg roll had flavor only from all the pepper added.  The House Chicken was bland and poor quality meat,  The Teriyaki Chicken was very dry and had an awful flavor.  Served with very little rice.  This was the worst teriyaki chicken I have ever tasted at a Chinese restaurant.  This place was lacking in friendly service.  Too many other good options and I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"have ate here many times and each time  we say never again  glutton loves punishment i guess but tonight is the Last  the food was  so bad rice dry chow mein noodles stale  food was so bad  and cold    i almost got sick  from this food     i would rather drive and pick up my  chineese food  or go to some place  that is good  and go in and eat   Not Here any more"}
{"text":"I tried orange chicken, shrimp with vegetables, and crab puffs and loved EVERYTHING! They delivered it promptly and the food was excellent. I was impressed. Good Chinese is hard to find. Definitely ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly delicious Chinese food.  I have ordered delivery twice with both times being delicious. The Triad in One, orange chicken, and crab puffs are all fantastic! Absolutely one of the best hidden gems in North Phoenix for Chinese."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service was great. Definitely ordering from here anytime I want Chinese!"}
{"text":"Clean Friendly Attentive Decent Grub for a decent price.   I had a Spicy fried chicken with fried rice, soup, egg roll and wonton. It was $5.15. The chicken, rice, soup were as expected, the egg roll was better and the wonton thing was boring and bland.   I would go back but it is not something I will be craving."}
{"text":"They have some great lunch specials all week long. The food is not exactly fancy Asian cuisine but it is good enough for the price. The service is fast and the food comes out hot. The bathrooms are a bit of a mess some times and could use an air freshener."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and normally has good serving sizes. I haven't found a Chinese restaurant that has impressed me this much yet."}
{"text":"I've only had mediocre experiences around town with Chinese places, but this one was great!! The staff were very friendly and they even gave us a free 2-liter :)  My Chinese food craving has been satisfied and my 4 year old even said he \"loved everything!\"  We will be return customers for sure."}
{"text":"This place is good, but I could copy and past any review I've ever written for your average strip mall  Chinese restaurant and it would apply.  Great if you're in the mood and nearby, but nothing here that distinguishes it and makes for a destination."}
{"text":"Great food, love the portions...and the fried rice is the best..no heavy delivery charges. ..just all around good food. .."}
{"text":"Prettty good! Fried rice and chow mein were tasty, orange chicken a little mushy but it was delivery and did taste really good. Beef and broccoli was good too. Delivery took about 15 minutes more than expected but not too bad anyway. I'll definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant!  Been going there for about 3 years and they did get new owners about a year ago.  We've dined in and taken out food.  It is indeed a hole in the wall but the service is always good and great sized portions - we always have leftovers!  My personal favorites are the crab puffs and the shrimp egg foo young.  My son really likes their eggrolls (I'm just not a fan of eggrolls at all).  The only problem I ever had was on a take out order - they forgot to include my crab puffs!  When I called to complain, they apologized and said they would send them over with their delivery person.  They arrived in about 5 minutes!  So I would definitely recommend Dragon Bowl..."}
{"text":"Ordered the orange chicken lunch special and hot & sour soup for takeout (note: I guess soup is not included with the lunch special if you get it for takeout, so I ordered it separately). I had to ask for the soup again because it wasn't packed in my bag when I arrived. I really liked both items, especially the soup, and the fried rice side is flavorful. I'm not a huge egg roll fan, but this one was pretty good. I wish the soup came in smaller sizes- 32 oz is a bit much for me, but hey, leftovers! No napkins or utensils were packed with my takeout which was odd, and inconvenient since I was going somewhere without silverware, but I found a spoon and managed! A few hang ups but overall I enjoyed the food- I will return."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Sizzling rice soup was delicious, orange chicken was ok, not much in crab Rangoon's and dumplings were good. I give a 3 rating.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"Loving this place all the food is good too. Love the orange chicken and the egg drop soup"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I ordered our favorites from this restaurant Thursday evening.  We like this restaurant for its high quality Asian dishes, its friendly employees, the cleanliness of the dining room, the efficiency and ease of ordering over the phone and the food is always hot when we go pick it up. It was so good in fact that I forgot to take pictures of it before I consumed it all. We were all famished and we did very little talking as we ate the food. Another plus to this restaurant is that it is next to the neighborhood where we have lived for the past 6 1/2 years.  I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce with steamed white rice, my husband ordered the Mongolian beef and my daughter ordered beef and broccoli with steamed white rice. She has Celiac Disease so she has to be careful where she orders her food from or chooses to dine at.  With Dragon Bowl, one is not ever disappointed. The food is always fresh and hot, cooked to perfection and delicious. I can't write enough about the food.  We will be back at a future date to order more food."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it won't be our last.  We ordered the crab puffs, Dragon Bowl Spicy chicken, and Mu Shu pork.  The puffs were fresh and standard quality.  The chicken had a nice but not overpowering kick to it.  The meat was also high quality as well.  The mu shu was really good as well.  Along with the food the service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place.  Ordered food for Graduation, went in early in day ordered and paid ahead,  food was ready when promised and everything was delicious.  Absolutely the best Soups....Hot n Sour is amazingly delicious!!!!!   Very friendly, courteous and knowledgable staff...."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were pretty good. Prices are pretty good. Literally just finished my meal- I'm taking my leftovers home, aka I'm satisfied. My bf got teriyaki chicken dinner combo and unfortunately didn't like the chicken and didn't even eat anymore of it but he really enjoyed the fried rice and lo mein as did I. Service is good, we didn't ask them if they could do anything about the teriyaki chicken so that's why I'm giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"We almost always do takeout from Dragon Bowl or delivery. The food is always on the money,  much like good old NY Chinese food. They are much better than the average AZ Chinese food place!   A regular item is the house lo mein always good. House fried rice is yummy too. The wife and kids like the sesame chicken and crab puffs. I have also ordered the mu shu pork, Mongolian beef, shrimp and scallops with brown sauce - all very tasty.  The one thing that really sets them apart from other places is the people! The owner is always there and she is so nice.  Her kids help out and they are very cool too. LIGHTENING FAST DELIVERY! Can't beat that.   Don't pass up Dragon Bowl!"}
{"text":"The food was hot, fresh, plentiful, and delivered on time. The driver seemed friendly enough and made a little small talk at the door.  I ordered the Mongolian beef dinner combo, and it somehow managed to be bland. The meat wasn't really seasoned and the lo mein was kind of 'meh'. I could have made a pun there, but I respect you too much, dear readers. My roommate's pepper beef was kind of the same. I liked the egg rolls and we both enjoyed the crab puffs. The sweet and sour sauce for dippng was quite good: heavier oh the sour than the sweet.  My roomie bought the food, which probably saved an incident at the door, when the bill was magically $35. According to their website, which is linked to their Yelp page, the dinner combos were about $8 and the crab puffs were $5. We also ordered a 2 litre of Pepsi, the price of which wasn't listed on the site.   Had I answered the door and been presented with a $35 tab (the total wasn't given on the phone) I would have refused delivery.   Had the price been closer to what I expected ($25 plus tax) I probably would have given a four star review, even if the food was underwhelming. I expect more at around $17 bucks a head."}
{"text":"Their website doesn't work, and I tried the phone number and it isn't in service?"}
{"text":"Their food here is so good! It became a fast favorite for my family & I. I always got kung pao chicken. There would be peanuts & medium size chopped slices of green onion, sooo  yummy! My dad also really loved their chow fun here too. The twice cooked pork or peking pork chop..I forgot which, is really good. The food also came in a reasonable portions that always got me full. Their service is always nice & friendly when we either take out or dine in. The cook also had us taste their shrimp rangoon, so delicious. The one thing I'm not sure of is.. if they're actually still open. My mom dialed their number a couple times & got nothing. Whenever we'd pass the place it didn't seem like they were. If they're really closed..that's a bummer because their place had the best authentic chinese food!"}
{"text":"I liked this place I ordered the Singapore noodles with tofu instead since I'm a vegetarian, they did say it would be a dollar more ? Which was a little confusing but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Had Dragon Bowl for the first time a few nights ago when my husband and I ordered Take-Out.  My husband got the Beef and Broccoli combination and I got the Sweet and Sour Pork combo with the sauce on the side.  YUMMY!!  It was all really good, and you get a TON of food!  Each meal came with: Fried Rice and Lo Mein, Fried Pork Wontons, and an eggroll!!  If you are craving Chinese Food this is a go to place for sure.  Can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Oh my GOD. This place. Guys. This. Place. We ordered delivery and the price was good, we were told a wait time of 45 minutes. Delivery arrived early, food nice and hot, with a free treat, to boot (Pepsi). The food is amazing and they really know what they're doing with their sauces. Husband got sesame chicken, I got the Thai spicy basil tofu. Both are just incredible. Great fresh vegetables, fragrant spices, perfect crisp on everything. I can't say enough about this restaurant, we haven't visited but dang for delivery they absolutely can't be beat."}
{"text":"Went there twice and ordered the teriyaki chicken! Its some kind of chicken filler or something but its not real chicken!! And dipped in teriyaki sause!! Its not the real thing!! I would never go back plus its never crowded which is a red flag!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. We had house fried rice, house lo mein, and general's chicken. It was delivered in less than half an hour on a week night, which was awesome. And the portions were very generous for the price. We will order from Dragon Bowl again, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Employee none stop harassing me after a simple miscommunication. Calling me a B**** and being threatening. Said his name is Nick. Also called manager and was very rude and hung up on me. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH. RIDICULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite Chinese restaurant. We've been dining here for years and that will never change. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious take out our dine in. The people are friendly and the food is always in point. My kiddos love watching the fish and I can count on always being satisfied with my dinner. Thank you Dragon Bowl!"}
{"text":"Dragon bowl is great! I love their chow mein! The owner and his daughters are always so nice. I am a repeat customer here and I plan on coming back every time I'm in phoenix. Thank you dragon bowl!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, and quick. Hubby and I got the dinner specials and shared, mongollian beef and sesame chicken. Both were yummy. Came with egg rolls and wontons which were also great. Super cheap. They have lunch specials for $4.99 which we will come back for. Only thing is the soups are huge, only $5 bucks though, but wish you could just get a small single serving. Excited to have this great chinese joint so close by!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here a couple weeks ago for the first time, I've been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant in the area.   What a nice surprise that the food was very good!   The room is small and they seem to be fairly busy.   The menu is extensive with all of the items you would expect to find.    But back to the food, I like sweet and sour chicken and this was a very generous serving with rice and the sides as part of the lunch deal.   I have also tried the chicken fried rice and would have to say it was some of the best I've ever tasted.   Had a couple visits since with the same great food!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese place in town! We love their pork fried rice, beef & broccoli (yum!!), and sesame chicken. The dumplings are also great. We really appreciate that they deliver to our house, and fairly quickly!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious authentic Chinese food! The servings are huge, so I'd recommend sharing an entree! It is was great for take out, and I didn't have to wait long. You could also dine in. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their house lo mein hit every spot of my craving!  It was a sizeable portion, which was great since I love cold Chinese leftovers, and the flavor was great.  My boyfriend got the Thai fried rice, and it too was really great.  I placed my order without any issue over the phone and drove to pick it up, though I do know they offer delivery.  When I arrived to pick up the order, the hostess was incredibly friendly.  We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food , the delivery was fast and the food still hot. Have eaten there for years and never disappointed. Love the  walnut shrimp and the eggplant is to die for."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken ever!! Blows Panda Express out of the water. And their portions are so big for their price"}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a year. No matter what I've ordered, I have never been disappointed. My whole family loves this place as well."}
{"text":"The service on to go orders is always very quick. The portions are amazing for the price and everything we have ordered has been good. They are really good about helping us customize what we order to be spicy or substitute different things."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  Great service, friendly staff and excellent food.  I moved back to this part of town after 15 years and was pleased to see them still in business and better than ever."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I was sold! The orange chicken wasn't the best and the wontons aren't crab puffs (sounds obvious) but I didn't think twice before ordering"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to sample a nice bowl serving of the shrimp fried rice and i just fell i  love. I just recently placed an order for my own seving of shrimp fried rice n chicken egg foo young (my favorite asian dish). Super excited for this rainy day n comfort food."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh. Big portions and everything thing taste great. This is my go to Chinese food place."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. Definitely better prices, servings that are generous. It fed us for a few more days. This is our new go to for Chinese."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in the valley so far! Prices are reasonable and they are very fast on delivery. I have tried other places but I keep going back to Dragon Bowl!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Family run, friendly staff and prompt service for either takeout or delivery. The food is consistent and the ingredients are fresh. Found them when we moved here 2 years ago and we've been regulars ever since."}
{"text":"I thought the food was average. Nothing special but nothing to complain about. But I felt really gross after eating it. Tummy bloated and a lil achy. I don't think I'll be returning. I think I'll have to settle with PF changs or panda for my chinese food cravings... Real big bummer cuz i love authentic chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Quality service and exceptional food. Delivery arrived 15 minutes later after being quoted 30-40 minutes. Will be ordering from Dragon Bowl again!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Chop Suey with brown rice and asked to add veggies. Was told he could add celery, mushrooms and carrots. Husband had Mongolian Beef Dinner Combo and egg rolls as an appetizer.  Kid who took our order came to our table 3 times within 4 minutes of giving us our menus and dragged his feet as he walked.   My dinner was out in less than 2 minutes which tells me it was either already sitting there or microwaved. I asked for extra veggies and all they added was carrots. I asked for mushrooms and extra veg and nothing. Yet they charged me $2.00. Chop Suey was slop on a plate and it all tasted freezer and had miniscule pieces of chicken. Bland and flavorless. Asked for some sort of spice to mask the flavor and they brought me chili oil which WASN'T spicy.   Husbands said his plate was so-so. We ate half so he can doctor it up at home.   Total was $27. This place SUCKS. I'll never eat there again.   1 star for egg rolls being the only good thing about tonight's dinner."}
{"text":"In summary, don't go here.  I checked out this place on a whim and it was the mistake of the weekend.  I picked up the curry combo plate because I was hoping to try the different types of food they have.  The fried rice was simply rice with soy sauce and maybe somewhat fried?  The noodles they had were pretty bland.  The curry was really bland and watery."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. They deliver absolutely free as long as you're in range and the food is amazing every time. The wonton soup and Singapore noodles are my go to, as well as the basil noodles!"}
{"text":"Great food, inexpensive prices and good service. Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. My families go to chinesse food place. We order delivery and they are always here at or before the time they say. Always get my order right. Very yummy food and the prices are perfect. You get a lot for what you pay. Very friendly staff as well. Sad we will be moving away but we will travel this way to eat here again. Thank you Dragon Bowl"}
{"text":"From what I can tell this is family owned and operated restaurant. I feel in love with there orange chicken dinner plate. Every time I have gotten my food it's been fresh and the they don't skim you on portions either, it can make two meals. Eating area is always clean and the tables are set as if you where at a 5 star restaurant and the napkins are even origami like folded."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and in bit of a hurry, the wait for my to-go order was tolerable albeit a bit lengthy around 20 minutes.  However, the egg rolls and lettuce wraps were lacking in flavor and presentation.  The lettuce was not particularly appealing and the egg rolls were a bit sweet and not especially good.  Overall I would not return any time soon."}
{"text":"Just moved into neighborhood and found this restaurant on yelp. We were greeted immediately by friendly staff and we belief owners were working. The food was hot, flavorful and price was very reasonable. There was a steady stream of customers and they acknowledge their regulars. They have take-out and do delivery which is a bonus."}
{"text":"This no frills, table service and take-out family-run restaurant serves solid affordable Chinese dishes.  Lunch specials are an extra good value.  My favorites include Orange Chicken, Yui Shan Beef, and Szechuan Green Beans.  Today I tried the Beef and Broccoli, and it did not disappoint.  Fresh vegetables, tender beef and a great portion for a lunch."}
{"text":"It is not \"often true\" but \"always true\" when a restaurant changes hands all previous reviews immediately become worthless. I wish Yelp would delete such reviews when someone buys an existing restaurant location. And that works both ways ... whether previous reviewers loved or hated a place before the new owners took over is meaningless  So my first experience with Dragon Bowl was October 1, 2014 under the \"new\" ownership. My experience was first-class in every respect. Yes it is a small hole-in-the-wall mom & pop place (my favorite kind of restaurant) but it is cheap and for the most part, surprisingly good.  I won't mention by name a nearby place which I had been getting Chinese food delivered from for about 7 or 8 years. They originally had bad reviews, then they seemed to improve and I gave them a boosted rating, then they fell apart. The food was bad, the quantities were embarrassingly small, their prices went up, their delivery person was scary and the last straw was they grossly overcharged on a delivery and their receipt was a blank piece of paper with the total on it, no itemization.  Dragon Bowl was a substantially different experience. The person who answered the phone was nice but had trouble understanding us. Not a problem, English is probably not her first language. The food is lower priced than my previous favorite but the quantities are shockingly larger and of much higher quality. The delivery person was friendly, on time, and was in a good mood.  One of my litmus tests for Chinese food is Hot & Sour soup, which can range from sewer dredges to gourmet. I especially like it on a cold rainy night and once had my favorite go-to place that I would go out of my way to, um, go to. They were in a different part of the country so my challenge was to find a place in Phoenix that is anywhere near as good. Dragon Bowl is better. I was blown away what was in it for the very low price ... big tender juicy shrimp, tasty hunks of pork, vegetables, tofu, crispy bamboo shoots and so many things I couldn't identify them all. Even by the time it got to us it was steaming hot. And speaking of hot, it was one of the spiciest Hot & Sour soups I've ever tasted. In other words, perfect.  Having a light appetite we also had the Pu Pu Platter. Again the price was dirt cheap for the quantity of food and it had all of the traditional components. I did find the ribs too chewy for my taste but otherwise every part of it was larger and tastier than my old Chinese restaurant. Honestly, one bowl of soup each and about half the Pu Pu Platter was so filling the rest was saved for leftovers.  There are a lot of things that can influence dropping an old favorite restaurant and finding a new one. If I had read the negative rating first about the old ownership of Dragon Bowl I may not have tried it. I'm glad I did and recommend you at least give it a chance, or give it a second try if you didn't like it before.  PS. There are about 5 servings per container of soup, my photo shows approximately 1 serving."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience in my life. The owners had let the children run the restaurant and that was a huge mistake. We've been there a few times & gotten ok service and food, but this time it was horrible. The children only gave us silverware for 2 when there was 3 in our party, got our order wrong, and mischarged our credit card. The restaurant was filthy, food was undercooked and felt like a 10 year old had prepared it, and they didn't provide enough menus or silverware for our party. When we went to checkout our credit card wasn't charged correctly and they refused to resolve it. We asked for an adult and one of the female children became belligerent and began screaming for us to GET OUT! in front of other customers who proceeded to leave with us instead of being harassed by the children running the restaurant. If you are looking for a family owned Chinese restaurant in the area with good food, good service, and excellent prices I would take your business to RICE & NOODLE @ 2017 E Cactus Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85022. Rice & Noodle also has free delivery. Please do not support Dragon Bowl and take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is good basic Chinese food. Nothing fancy about the menu or the establishment, but good eating in a neighborhood spot. The seasonings were mild, but we didn't order spicy. The pork chops were juicy. The eggrolls thick wrapped like from my youth. The egg fu yung was delicate. One caveat, they put the pork, shrimp, etc in the brown sauce not in the egg. Oh, the fish tank is for show not food storage."}
{"text":"Love this place!! They never disappoint with great prices on great food!! So glad I live close, but would drive here to get my fix! Vegetable lo mein and honey chicken are on point!!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast and friendly service.  I ordered the Mongolian beef, house special chicken, and BBQ pork fried rice. It was all pretty good, though I may try something other than the house special chicken next time. I called in for delivery and got my food in 13 minutes."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's the best Chinese food in the north Valley as some other review states but it is very good, good prices, and about average delivery times. Food is delivered still hot and fresh. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best chineese food I have had for years.  Everything is made fresh and all special orders come out perfect.  Best chineese food.  Gary is a wonderful chef."}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight and it was great! Food was good and service was wonderful thanks to our server Todd. A lot of food for a great price!"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant while visiting Mashawi Lebanese Grill just a door or two down; and after checking out the menu online; have made two trips to the restaurnt; as well as ordered take-out/delivery.  There are no bargains on the menu save the daily luncheon specials - which truly are a bargain.  That said - the quality and quantity of the food fairly reflect the price.  Each meal I've ordered is more than enough for two; and I'm 6'9\" and 250 pounds.  Exceptionally clean, immaculate tabletops, linen napkins.  They clearly do a booming takeout business from my observation while dining in the restaurant.  A minor criticism - the server seems a it surly; maybe becuase she always seems so busy."}
{"text":"Great little spot for good quality, great tasting Chinese food. The lunch specials are great, a ton of food and drink for less than $10! Service is quick and friendly, I'm usually in and out of there in under 25mins!"}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place?!!  Family owned and operated, the food is fresh and delicious. Don't be shy - ask for recommendations. We were told that the egg drop soup, which is really tasty, is better with green onions and chili. The potstickers are divine, and the dipping sauce is perfect. We had the chicken dragon bowl - too spicy for me, but the chicken was super tender. We also had the Shanghai Noodles, a great alternative to fried rice or Lo mein. The flavor was great, and there was no skimping on ingredients.   I'm a little far for their delivery service, which is disappointing but probably for the best as I can see eating their food frequently."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant with a large selection of choices. Quality and service have been good. Have had teriyaki and seseme chicken dishes. My favorites have been mongolian beef or beef and broccoli dishes with the lo mein soft noodles. Very ample portions and usually enough for two meals. I usually prefer Thai or Vietnamese food, however, my son would probably live here if they let him. He has the orange chicken at least twice a week. He hasn't been back to Panda Express since his discovery of Dragon Bowl."}
{"text":"I was shocked how great the food was in this unassuming strip mall. Tried the hot and sour soup, the black bean rock fish, Yu Shan eggplant and salt and pepper pork chops. All were terrific and the portions are huge. I must try!!!"}
{"text":"We usually go to another Chinese restaurant but decided to try this one.   There wasn't a wait even though it's a smaller restaurant than most Chinese restaurants.  Lunch specials around $5-$7.  Food was delicious. Duck served daily.  They have hot and sour soup and egg drop soup choices daily.  Atmosphere nice, cool inside.  Great first visit experience. Will be back often."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Arizona in January and i have been looking for a Chinese restaurant that  can feel my void. I quickly determined it is not going to be this place. Although, the portions were large, the food was extremely bland. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I had a bowl of the hot and sour soup and got the dragon bowl chicken to go. The Hot and Sour soup was very good, definitely worthy of 4 stars. The dragon bowl chicken (one of their signature dishs) was ok, nothing special, but ok. The choice of the standard folding box for this entree was a real problem. On the walk to the car I noticed that the bottom of the plastic bag was already wet. The bag itself wasn't leaking (and luckily the sauce never did leak through the bag), but the sauce had already over-flowed the sides of the container and covering the entire bottom of the bag. I put some paper towels down on the floor of the car and placed the bag on top of them and the bag held up so no leaking in the car. However, the napkins soy package and the fortune cookies were all coated in sauce. They should either drain out some of the sauce or put it in a different to go container, maybe a soup container. ."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and delish we are def coming back  Both my and my boyfriends dish were full of flavor and we kept licking off each other's food"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for a family celebration yesterday and were pleasantly surprised.  We hadn't found good Chinese food nearby, and this is our new place.  The pork fried rice was yummy.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken were both good.  The Mongolian beef was not exactly what we're used to, but it was tender and tasty.   The egg rolls are on the small side, but good.  The chicken chop suey was very nice, too.  The order arrived much sooner than expected, and everything was nice and hot.  We will definitely be ordering from Dragon Bowl again!"}
{"text":"We'd been looking for a replacement for out long time go to Chinese restaurant..prices rising too fast and menu not a large as it used to be.  I looked up several menus for places within 15 minutes of us and Dragon Bowl made the cut on menu selections and prices.   It's a plain storefront run by a father and daughter, aided the night we were there by the granddaughters. The extensive menu has several dishes your usual storefront Chinese restaurant doesn't have. My 'always Kung Pao ChIcken Extra Hot' hubby was tempted by the Hunan beef and he loved it.. Green Beans with Pork was delicious. The soups sounded good but we stuck with just entrees this time. Next time we will plan for leftovers (big portions) and try appetizers and soup..probably Sizzling Rice, my favorite.   Their selection of lunch combos is large and they also have dinner combo plates, hard to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always nice delivery people! Food is good although I wish the Mongolian beef was better"}
{"text":"When I think of a solid family neighborhood Chinese restaurant, this is what I think of.  Dragon Bowl was that for me when I lived in the area and I and my family have eaten there over a dozen times.  Great portions, great price, and delicious food.  The staff is always nice and pleasant to me and they use the polyfoam crates instead of paper which helps against leaks.  I recommend checking them out!"}
