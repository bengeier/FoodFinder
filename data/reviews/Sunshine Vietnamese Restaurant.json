{"text":"One of the guys that works her is such an a$hole. 
My food was off so we took it back and he would not replace the dish. The food clearly smelt sour. 
Never eating here again"}
{"text":"Slowly, very slowly the Vietnamese restaurants that I have been known to frequent have been decreasing in quality. It's time to find a new place to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings.
Previously I've only ever had the prawn salad rolls for takeaway but the whole family has been stricken with a nasty cold that only a steaming hot satay Pho can fix. We were all really impressed with the quality and quantity of the food we ordered. 
Four Beef 'Special' Pho with tendon, rare beef, cooked beef, and beef balls
Chicken Satay Soup...when they ask you if you want it regular spicy, that means 'eyeball sweating' spicy. Be forewarned. 
Vegetable Pho...packed full of fresh veggies, including fancy cut carrots.
Pork and Shrimp roll vermicelli bowl...full of meat and satisfying.

Oh, and the kicker for me? They answer the phone with a cheery, \"Hello Sunshine!\"."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, fresh food. The staff is so friendly. I just love this place! All of the soups are great."}
{"text":"I  ordered rare beef noodle soup. Price is cheaper compared to Edmonton. Bean sprouts and basil are very fresh.  The only disappointment is the portion, it's small and not filling enough, not much beef."}
{"text":"The sate pho was very tasty and service was friendly and food came out fast. Would come back and try other items."}
{"text":"As a shift worker and an avid avoider of tanning and the like, I was initially leery of any place that had the word \"Sunshine\" in the title.

However I was pleasantly surprised to find this little gem tucked away on our end of the city. The food was excellent, the staff courteous and timely. 

I will most definitely be coming here with my wife more often and recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurants are plentiful, especially in my area of the city. But like pub/watering holes, I like to say that Sunshine is one of my \"locals\" for Vietnamese food.

Located in Canyon Meadows beside the more visible Blockbuster, Sunshine village is open 7 days a week until 9pm. A very convenient place to visit for after mass Sunday lunches.

It might just be me but Vietnamese food is the most simplest and accessible cuisine, so its hard to say Sunshine offers the most tastiest out of all the other restaurants I frequent in the city. I find that with Vietnamese food, its all about using the freshest ingredients, and with Sunshine, the food is freshly prepared and with very little time for wait.  

Great service as well, because we are frequent patrons, the manager/owner and his niece instantly recognize us. Very nice folks!

I feel I should insert some witty anecdote or joke (as I do in every review). But alas I'm all out...for now as Bill Nye's evil alter ago Beakman would always say:
\"Bada bing, bada bang, bada blast off!\""}
{"text":"Disgusting restaurant with horrible service. 
Came here with my parents for some pho, I had the soup pho. While eating it, I found a HAIR in a piece of beef tendon and the hair was clearly from a human. I called the waitress and she brought it to the kitchen, and then something shocking happened. 
The waitress didn't apologize, the cook/owner came to me, didn't apologize and just said, the hair came with the beef when he got the beef, not their fault. 
I was disgusted and angry. No apologies for having a hair in my food? And it's not their fault? So my soup suppose to have hair in it?
Horrible horrible horrible, AVOID!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how this place has been rated so well. I have been here many times again and again and every time I kick myself for coming back. However there really isn't any decent Vietnamese restaurants around this side of the city.

Not sure with what's going on with their quality control but it seems to be going downhill. Tonight I ordered the grilled pork chop with shredded pork and steamed egg on white rice. What I received was an overcooked pork chop, the shredded pork were absolutely mushy and greasy beyond recognition and the egg? Well I wouldn't call that a steamed egg. It was a fried egg covered in grease.

Also orders the 3 skewers of beef, chicken and shrimp. Same thing with the grease that had pooled at the bottom of the styrofoam box, the chicken and shrimp cooked beyond repair. Chewing on leather was definitely the case. And the beef, well it was cooked perfectly but so damn chewy I couldn't finish and had to spit it out because it was not breaking down. Yes it was very close to closing time, but that shouldn't be an excuse for such sub par food. All my food looks like they were in the middle of cleaning the grill and threw mine in there while doing so.

The only good thing about my meal were the 2 spring rolls on the side and that too was a tad overcooked. I am quite disappointed to say the least about tonight's dinner. It definitely has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will no longer be coming back to this establishment and will just ignore my craving of decent Vietnamese food when I am in an area of town that has the best restaurants. Sorry sunshine, but there was definitely no ray of light on my meal today.
Feeling disappointed =("}
{"text":"This is only the third time I've had Vietnamese while I've been in Cowtown so I wasn't sure what to expect. We came on a Saturday evening around 7:00pm and they were fairly busy. Looked like it was family run and the son checked up on us several times.

- Shredded pork (#16) and prawn salad rolls (#17) ($4.50 each half order) - these were pretty typical and didn't leave an impression on either of us. The peanut sauce had a bit of hot sauce added to it; never seen this before but I like it!

- Rare beef and brisket noodle soup (#23) ($10.25) - this was O's bowl, I don't remember trying it but she wolfed it down.

- Satay beef noodle soup (#29) ($11.25) - this satay was LEGIT. It's been awhile since I've been impressed with pho but Sunshine's bowl had depth, deep, rich flavour and spicy. Even the beef was top quality; their meat was succulent, tender and memorable.

I'd happily come back to Sunshine Vietnamese to try some of their other soup offerings but you seriously cannot go wrong with the satay. Freakin' bomb."}
{"text":"Sunshine gets extra points for being inexpensive AND having an above average vermicelli bowl with shredded pork and spring rolls. It's my go to dish, you see, and it's how I rank every Vietnamese place I visit my first time in. Although at Sunshine, this particular bowl had shredded and grilled pork. Either way... Big bowl, check. Lotsa noodles, check. Crispy spring rolls, check. Under $10, check!

There's not much else to this place. Simple, to the point and delicious."}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese food. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken soup and he said it's the best he's had in Calgary. The chicken was actually good white meat instead of the dark grisly stuff so many serve. Good vegetarian options. Got the vegetarian spring rolls and they were quite tasty! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Nestled in the Blockbuster strip mall on Canyon Meadows and Bonaventure Drive (oops, former Blockbuster), Sunshine is a no-frills, small Vietnamese establishment that makes up for its simple decor with delicious meals. It is quiet, reasonably priced, and close to home - a perfect destination for a quick Vietnamese fix.

Our first time here, we showed up at quarter to six on a Sunday evening, mishearing about its closing time. They were kind enough to not only let us in, but sit down and eat. We are both fairly quick eaters (especially when hungry), and coupled with their quick service, we were gone by ten past, barely a blip! 

Vietnamese places are fairly dime-a-dozen around Calgary, but I will champion Sunshine as one of the best in the south. Recommended!

{"text":"I think it's the only vietnamese restaurant worth going to in a 10km radius.  The south is plagued with bad restaurants but this one is good.  The dishes are fairly authentic, the prices are good, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite beef satay soup in town.  I used to live close by but now that I've moved further away I still make the drive.  Two guys work the floor, both nice but the one guy is super friendly and always makes you feel welcome.  He even remembers my order.  I have walked in her during the week at lunch and not been able to get a table.  

Back to the satay.  The broth is dark and rich.  It seasoned beautifully with a healthy portion of beef.  It is served with beautiful basil, always fresh"}
{"text":"The satay pho was really yummy and spicy, perfect for a cold winter day. I would also recommend the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I worked in the office building next to Sunshine Vietnamese, and when we moved offices, losing the popular lunch spot was pretty much the worst thing about the move. The owner never smiles, until he gets to know you then he calls you by your favourite dish. I have never ordered anything besides #38 (pork, shredded pork and spring rolls bun) and #75 (spicy beef sub) because they are so good it's hard to venture out to try anything else. When I go for Vietnamese, I nearly always order the pork and spring rolls bun, and this one is by far on of my favourites. In my opinion, their Vietnamese sub is miles better than Thai Tai (which I don't think is a good restaurant to begin with). If you're down in the area and want a cheap good meal, this is the place to go!"}
