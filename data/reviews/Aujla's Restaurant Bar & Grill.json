{"text":"Best Butter Chicken I've ever had...  Would give a 5 star but my drink was really messed up from what I ordered but that's ok."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food. One person working the entire front of the restaurant. Food wasn't good either. Save time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Big portions and tasty. Would have given it 4 stars but the pint glasses weren't chilled and the pop for the mixed drinks was completely flat. Oh and bring ear your ear plugs because the music was terrible!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it took over North Taphouse. It should've stayed North Taphouse. The waitress was incredibly slow even though the place was empty, lost her order pad so she had to come out 15 minutes after we ordered to get our order again, then when we got the food, it was messed up. Icing on the cake: the waitress ran after me after I paid the bill to say I paid the wrong bill WHICH SHE BROUGHT ME only to be told the bill I paid was the right bill. Waitress sucked comically bad but the food was good after I picked off the stuff I asked not to be on it."}
{"text":"Love love love their butter chicken. Has to be the best I've ever had. I dream about when I'll have it next lol. And the service is great. Every time I go the staff is so friendly and helpful.   They also have an interesting selection of beers and some excellent specials through out the week. Don't get confused about the reviews talking about the Taphouse. That's what used to be there. I gather they weren't very good."}
