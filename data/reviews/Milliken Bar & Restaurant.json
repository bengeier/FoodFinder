{"text":"So this was my very first dimsum experience. I had come onto Yelp to find great reviews about this place, and I was super excited to finally go out and try some quality dimsum. When I pulled up to the parking lot, I was a bit confused because there are NO english signs anywhere except \"Milliken Bar & Restaurant\". The exterior makes it look kinda sketchy as well. Eventually I found my way through to the half-packed restaurant on a weekday at lunch. 

So we sat down (two of us) and were handed a few slips of paper that were written in chinese. We had no idea what to do with them. Eventually a waiter came and handed us an english menu that seemed to explain to us a bit of what was going on. Confused as it was our first time, we didn't exactly know what to do with the empty checkboxes, and nobody could explain it to us because no one could speak english. We were able to order, as we realized that they bring the dimsum per-order and don't exactly go around pushing carts. When we tried to ask what each dumpling contained and its ingredients, the waiters would just walk away because a)they couldnt understand b)they couldnt respond. It was extremely frustrating because we had no idea what to do and we just wanted a good dimsum experience haha.

However, when we finally surpassed the confusion our orders came. The dimsum was quite good, we ordered the crystal shrimp dumplings, king mushroom w/taro root, chinese broccoli w/garlic and seafood congee. The food was good which is why I gave this place two stars instead of one. A little bit salty, though. Good value, $2.10 per dish on weekdays.

Our bill came up to around $24. I paid $30, asking for change and they came back with my change. When I left a $4 tip however they wouldn't let me leave. We tried to exit but they would not let us leave until we left the $2. When we asked them why, again they could not explain and we were forced to give the $2. Sure, it's only $2 but this is pretty unacceptable as they're basically forcing the amount of tip we give them. Maybe there was a service fee? we're not sure but nobody explained anything to us.

The service is what really brings the restaurant down. I cannot speak or understand a word of chinese and that is what this restaurant is all about. If you're a newbie like me to dimsum you should not make this place your first visit. Bring someone experienced with this place and/or has knowledge in chinese haha"}
{"text":"I have not come here to try their dim sum but only for their dinners. They have good set combo dinners for 4-10 ppl. We usually get their combo for 4-6 ppl which gives you peking duck, lobsters, soup, veggie, steam fish, and one meat dish with an ending of dessert for less than $120 total before tips. I have been here on a few occasion with my Dad and friends and its definitely a nice place to dine."}
{"text":"The name and location is a bit deceiving.

The place sounds like a bar, from the street, it reads and looks like one, but it isn't!

We came for dim sum on a Sunday at noon and it was a short wait which is nice since most places are pretty busy at this time.  We ordered roughly 18 dishes and the bill came out to $59 for 6 people.  The prices seemed okay, there are no sizes at least when I came, everything was the size price.

The dim sum itself was okay, nothing to write home about.  The menu is a little bit odd if you only read English though since there are some typos.  Note that this isn't a push cart restaurant, it is by paper orders."}
{"text":"This is one of the good Dim Sum places in Scarborough. Great selection for a reasonable price! I came here on a Saturday at 11AM and it was packed. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it. This place has your typical Dim Sum dishes and everything was as good as you'd hope. The only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is that I wasn't blown away by anything. Still, I would highly recommend this place to satisfy your Dim Sum cravings!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for a family dinner.  The restaurant was probably close to 25% full but yet, service was slow.  The servers ignored us and did not refill our tea.  When they did take away our tea pots, they did not bring it back until I went up to the counter and asked why we've been waiting ten minutes for our tea pots to be refilled.  Compared to the usual Chinese restaurant time, the food took a long time to come out.  

Too bad, originally this was our go-to restaurant when we wanted casual night outs but I guess we'll have to find another one."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Milliken Bar and Restaurant on May 11 2013. First time coming here for dinner (and maybe our last.) After reading some good reviews from other yelpers on dim sum. I thought I should give dinner a try with my family to celebrate Mother's Day.

I arrived with my family at 6pm the restaurant was half empty. Yet the waiter said no tables are available because they have been reserved. I saw his list of reservations which was four pieces of letter size paper taped together. The 6 pm reservations was one and half pages long (30 tables at least) and then 6:30 pm was about a handful of tables. There was 7 and 8 pm reservations as well. The host gave me a number (#1 party of 5) and said it will be quick. Only one host managed the the front desk and he was busy with taking orders as well. I watch people coming in one after another and the 6pm reservations soon filled the entire restaurant. 

The table layouts were mainly for families 8 or more. It's hard to get tables for smaller parties of 2/3/4 on this day. Some people that walked in as a parties of 2 had to wait awhile (but not too long since it was normally a senior plus their child). The host gave in to set up smaller tables of 2 between awkward empty spaces so 2 people tables won't leave. The host was kind enough to open folded chairs for seniors to sit and wait.

The host kept checking on me that it will be quick. there were other parties after me that didn't make reservations. (some people were getting grumpy.) I waited 45 mins for a table. The host kept getting bothered by the folks that was given #2 on the waiting list. Right before I got my table and sat down #2 party of 6 left.

We sat down thinking we can order the regular set dinner combos we saw outside the window while waiting. The menu was different this weekend and was only one sheet of paper back & front with only Chinese characters. My mother had the lady translate and we ordered one of the set combos. We ate corn soup with some fish maw bits, half a steam running chicken, a steam fish, sweet & sour pork, two garlic fried lobsters, and mushrooms on bak choy. They provided red bean paste as dessert. 

Normally I can get in and out of Chinese restaurants in 30-45 mins. Yet this place their delivery of dishes to the table was EXTREMELY slow. It took over 2 hours to completed our dinner because we wait 10-15 mins per dish to come out. Every time a dish came out we would completely finish the dish (because we were so hungry). It look like the other tables was experiencing the same issue. Many customers kept complaining and all you hear from the host is \"sorry. It's so busy today.\" My family finish every single piece of food on the plate for all dishes. And some left hungry to buy another second dinner. Normally we never finish everything yet we were so hungry it was all cleaned. 

The restaurant looks like it was understaffed. You see waiters come out with food all the time but not for my table. The host is amusing to watch because he's going crazy with seating people and bouncing around taking orders and putting down food. He was good at watching out for customers (since we are his bosses. Kept calling us \"Lo sei\" Cantonese for boss). Kept apologizing. He didn't have a temper and try to keep his cool when customer complained.

I rated this place two stars mainly for poor organization and slow service. The reservation list was poorly allotted and should not be taking that many 6 pm tables and 6:30 tables. (Chinese families don't eat that quick.) The food was okay. (For the price I paid could of went somewhere better.) I think the long wait for the table is mainly due to the kitchen being slow. The kitchen should serve the entire table their menu before starting on another one. So tables eat quick and leave. 

The restaurant was bright. The decor of this place is casual chinese. They had a bar and i saw some people bring their own wines to cork. The washrooms were dirty with wet tiles but had hand towels which was a plus. 

I guess don't go to this restaurant on a holiday, festival, or for special celebration days like Mother's Day."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum restaurant in the recent months. The times I've visited were all weekday mornings so no wait. The dishes are tasty and the price is good. Just don't order their rice in clay pots because i tried a few but they were all pretty bad (mainly dice with a few pieces of meat on top). I had dim sun for 2 hours here with a girl friend who I haven't seen for a long time. They didn't disturb us or rush us out while we were catching up which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Good selection of dim sum dishes at a very reasonable price point.  Decor is non-existent, but with a name that includes \"bar and restaurant\", you can't expect much.  If you go in with no expectations, you will be just fine."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, cheap dim sum and now also 24 hours ! What else could you ask for ! I came late at night with a couple of friends and ordered a bowl of pork bone congee, a pecking duck combo that came with 2 lobsters, a plate of ma po tofu, 1 steamed tilapia and last of all a plate of vegetables. Our bill came to around 70 dollars which is surprisingly very cheap despite all the things we got. So if your ever hungry and awake at 3 am or wanna find a good place to go dim sum during the morning then this is the place to go !"}
{"text":"Visited Miliken last evening with my family and thorough give this restaurant two thumbs up.

Decor: Expect your typical Chinese restaurant with a stage for weddings, a large dark wood counter, and many tables all around.

Service: Incredible! They set up two tables in case the one we reserved was not satisfactory, there were other options available. This was significant. Also, because we had lobster, the servers came by often to clear the dishes. Although there was a minor language issue, we saw how hard the Chinese server tried, and it was well worth it.

Foods: We had the 6 items Peking Duck feast, which is a special now for $58, and it was in abundance. The food came quickly, and though there were some that slanted more on the salty side, overall, very good foods!

Well worth for a family gathering!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A pretty good Chinese restaurant.

I came here with my family and we ordered a classic Chinese ten-course meal. Everything came all at once, and more or less in improper order, but the food was good and we all really enjoyed it.

The service was great. My mom called ahead to book a large lobster for 12. They brought out a couple of lobsters for us to choose from, and we picked the bigger one. I thought this was a nice touch.

Best: Lobster fried rice, sweet and sour pork.

The lobster was actually pretty good, but it was a Maggi sauce, and I'm a bigger fan of ginger chive sauce. Of course, that didn't stop me from eating almost half the thing myself.

All in all, a very nice dining experience, moderately clean restaurant, zero decor as in most decent Chinese places and good food."}
{"text":"Like mother like daughter.... My mom and I are very alike in that we love to eat. We differ because she usually likes to venture out to try new Chineae restaurants and I like to venture out and try eveything! The Miliken Bar was our weekend adventure.

We got the dinner special. For $70 we got: Peking Duck, steamed fish, broth braised lobster, daikon and winter melon soup, beef stir-fry, stir fried greens and adzuki (red bean) sweet soup. This special is even more of a bargain during weekdays ($58!) 

The food was a bit on the salty side for me but all in all very tasty. The Peking duck was the best! The duck was not too fatty and the skin was crisp. The crepe was nice and thin and is one of the best I've had at a Chinese restaurant! The stir fried beef had a hint of five spice, was battered and then smothered in sauce. This was a little too salty for me. The lobster was good, the meat was nice and firm, though I wish they would've added some scallions in it for flavour. The stir fried greens were a little oily but savory. The fish was nice and tender though a but too flaky IMHO. The red bean soup is prolly one of the best in Toronto. The consistency was perfect! Not too watered down but not too glutinous either and just the right amount of sweetness. 

A must try!  Service was good. They changes our plates after we filled it with lobster shells and gave us clean ones."}
{"text":"Milliken Bar and Restaurant is one of my go-to Dim sum restaurants because one of the \"uncle\" named Mark gor, used to know me/my family because of how often we go there. Unfortunately, he doesn't work there anymore - because apparently, he started his own restaurant(??). Hearsay from one of the other employees when my mom asked about him. He takes care of customers well and he talks to you and tries to get to know you better too.

When me and V went here on our own, he recognized me and offered us this English menu (with pictures!!) because we don't speak fluent Cantonese LOL exposed... and he did it on his own accord in order to help us with our ordering - which was super good customer service as he anticipates our needs and tries to ease the problem (should it arises).

I took a picture of the English menu because it would be embarrassing every time we go there and we'd need to ask for it... So pictures would help keep our little secret, haha. I wonder now if Dim sum restaurants should adapt with the iPad technology that ayce sushi places use. But that would kind of ruin the origin of \"Dim sum\" feel, with the ladies-pushing-food-carts-around-and-you-have-to-holler-at-them kind of vibe. Gears are turning in my head and now I feel that ayce sushi is an adaptation for the Western environment and they don't have that kind of culture in Japan... But who knows?

Moving on.

I've been eating Dim sum since I was younger and the two most popular dishes I know are the \"?? / ?? / Shu or Siu Mai / Shao Mai / Pork Dumplings\" and the \"Ha or Har Gow / Xia Jiao / Shrimp Bonnet\" Sources from: Har gow - Wiki & Shu mai - Wiki. Yes, I had to Wiki for the English terms because I've only known the Mandarin or Cantonese version of saying it. By the way, the word \"Dumplings\" is so overused in the Western country in terms of describing Chinese food because there are SO many different type of \"dumplings\"!! It's crazy.

When I was younger, I loveeed Har Gow, but recently, I've been loving Siu Mai more.

Pai Gwat or Steamed Ribs (thanks Google and Wiki (again)!!) are a mixed of pork and beef ribs. The meat is chewy and they're usually made with black bean sauce. Those brown woven baskets you see in the pictures are steamer baskets which are commonly found during Dim sum. Usually the plates are super hot so the steamer baskets are to help waitresses to put food on the table, but even sometimes those steamer baskets can get really hot too - so be careful.

Out of the many dishes, \"Feng Zhao or Chicken Feet\" is actually pretty popular for Dim sum. I don't usually eat it, but I did tried a small piece of it for the first time quite recently. I liked the taste of the sauce, it was tangy but not overly sweet. However, the point of this dish was to eat the entire thing (or as much as you want) and spit the tiny bones out after. To basically eat the skin and the sauce and stuff. I believe they {some random super ancient person from 999999 years ago} wanted to use the entire chicken as a dish and not waste any part of the animal when it could be eaten...
Just my speculation anyways.

These dishes are some of the few I've ate the other day, and you can look at the English menu for more Dim sum reference. Some of the more common dishes in Dim sum, includes the \"Char siew bao / BBQ Pork Bun\", Spring rolls, \"Luo mai fan / Nuomi fan / Chinese sticky rice\", etc etc. You can also order noodles and congee/porridge as well!

This restaurant is super efficient with their service after you've placed your orders. However, Milliken Bar & Restaurant doesn't have \"food cart ladies\". I know some other Chinese restaurants do though. If you can't find the food item you want on the order sheet, you can always ask one of the workers and they'll gladly help you - which is one of the reasons why I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum lunch today with some relatives. Never been here for lunch but we met here because they were coming up from downtown. Place was pretty packed at 12.20pm and not many empty tables. We had to sit right at the front door. The dim sum ain't bad, especially for the price. We got a good variety of things like fried squid tentacles, shrimp rice rolls, har gow, steamed tripe, steamed beef balls, fried dace fish balls, stuffed peppers/tofu and congee. The rice rolls were really good, transparent, smooth and not too soft. The worst dish was the congee, not much ingredients, too thick and didn't look appetizing. The fried dace fish balls were not bad and even came with the proper clam sauce. Not many people bother to make this dish and give the correct sauce. 
Not somewhere that I would've chosen to dine at but I'm pleasantly surprised. Would come here again, if I was in the area. If you can dine early, 8am to 11am (mon - fri), then S, M or L dim sum is only $1.80 per dish. (It's $2.20 on Sat and Sun mornings)"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside exterior fool you, this restaurant serves authentic fresh dim sum that is very reasonably priced. In it's past life, it was a bar called Daybreak where you could sing karaoke in a separate room. Daybreak was a pretty shady bar where shady things happened in the washroom but the beer was cheap.

So one day I was hungry for dim sum and I was in the area, so I decided to drop in. They have done a pretty good job of renovating the inside, they have kept the washrooms the same as before and the patio the same which is still an eyesore that has not been renovated.

They charge $2.10 for most dishes on the weekday and $2.40 for most dishes on the weekend. They also charge .80 a person for cha wei, in English it translates to a tea fee which is pretty common for every dim sum restaurant but normally it's $1 or higher.

Normally I order  a lot of the basics like har gow (shrimp dumpling, siu mai (pork dumpling, har cheung (shrimp roll) and my favourite fung zaau (chicken's feet).

At Milliken Bar & Restaurant instead of old ladies pushing carts around, you order from a sheet and a waiter or waitress will bring the food to your table when it's ready. This process usually ensures that the food is freshly made and hasn't been sitting around. The food like I mentioned is fresh, pretty well executed, decent sized portions and tastes good. The service is not bad, pretty comparable to most of the dim sum restaurants in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed their cheap (well-priced) dim sum several times so I brought my family here for dinner on a Saturday night. We were a party of 3 adults and 2 kids and arrived before 6pm to a restaurant less than half filled but barely got a table! Several parties of people after us got turned away because the restaurant was booked full of reservations.

We ordered from the set menu. Our dinner for 4 included 1) king mushroom with shrimp, 2) crispy chicken, 3) preserved vegetable with pork and 4) steamed fish. All this for $39.80! I love Chinese food :) 

We got free soup to start which was vegetable and pork based. The vegetable dish came next but was more like \"shrimps on a bed of Chinese vegetables with a few  king mushrooms\" rather than what was advertised. The fish was fresh and delicious and the chicken skin on the crispy chicken was very yummy. The preserved veg and pork (belly) had good flavour and did not disappoint. My kids also enjoyed the food which made it a good evening for me. I liked the complimentary Red bean soup (not excessively orange peel-y).

As we ate, the restaurant filled up. Noticed a nearby table brought their own booze. Service was standard for a Chinese restaurant...there were pretty busy that night too. There's a party room near the front that fits 4 large tables for private gatherings. 

Definitely want to come back for the Peking duck and roast pigeon."}
{"text":"4.5

Dim sum at $1.80 for S,M, and L before 11am on weekdays. $2.20 after 11am. Very reasonable portions. Tasty food? Yes please.

Had: (a lot of food)

For $1.80:
Steamed chicken feet - This (phoenix talon) is my new dim sum craving. Portion was 3 big pieces. slightly spicy, slightly sweet, still savory sauce.
Steamed beef tendon - Good stuff. Tender, slightly sticky tendon. Tendon had soaked in a lot of the sauce, so the tendon had flavor.
Steamed rice noodle roll with snow pea shoots and king oyster mushroom - small slivers of oyster mushroom, but other than that, can't complain.
Steamed rice noodle roll with deep fried dough stick - Alright. Could have been a tad more crispy, but for that price, I'm not going to complain.
Deep fried taro dumpling - Wu gok. My favorite dim sum choice. 3 pieces for $1.80? Yes. Crispy stuff. Lots of taro. Yum.
Spare ribs with black bean sauce - good portion. Spare ribs weren't super chewy. Slightly spicy from the peppers.
Tofu with fish - deep fried tofu with fish paste. 3 pieces. Crispy tofu. 
Pork stomach with pickled veggie - not enough pickled veggie flavor, but not bad. On the blander side. Lots of white pepper smell though. Oh. Also peppercorns in the sauce.
Chicken pies with portuguese sauce - didn't even touch this because we ordered too much food.
Fried bean curd sheet rolls - minced pork inside, I think. 3 or 4 to an order. I can't remember. Crispy on the outside. Filling was decent.
Minced pork cake on rice - didn't touch this either because we wanted to bring it home. $1.80. Um. Yeah. If I had 2, it'd be $3.60, if I did my math right, and I'd have leftovers if I just had the two for lunch...or dinner...
Sesame ball with egg yolk - dessert! Wrong description in Chinese. In Chinese, it says there should be bitter melon. No bitter melon. Just a glutinous rice shell covered in sesame, deep fried, and filled with a sweetened salty egg yolk sauce (it's not a paste) that just oozes out. I have no idea why the glutinous rice part is dyed green, but it doesn't matter. 4 balls to an order. These are fantastic.
Steamed milk with ginger sauce - fairly large bowl of it. Like larger than most individual servings of Chinese soup. Ginger sauce was distinct, but not overwhelming. Dessert, but mild dessert.

For $2.60(?): I believe they were $2.60 for special items. Still super cheap.
Black pepper beef short ribs - still had some beef taste. Fairly tender.
Stewed beef internals and turnip - Sauce had flavor. Internals were fairly tender. Good ratio of internals to turnip.

There may have been more, but I forget. Total damage after tax was $35 plus change. Total leftovers (after 3 people chowed down) - 2 large boxes and 2 small boxes. I think this is my new favorite dim sum place. Bonus: they use actual Chinese mustard (insert spazz about inappropriate use of yellow ballpark mustard at Chinese restaurants).

Lots of menu options. Super cheap. 

Final question: If dim sum can be this cheap, why are tapas so expensive?"}
{"text":"Dim sum:
- Early bird deal throughout the entire week (weekdays cheaper) if you get in before 10:30am. 
- No lineup 
- Above average food (consistent)
- Menu available with English and pictures (good for people who do not speak the language or/and who are not familiar with dim sum)

For the above reasons, this is my go-to dim sum place. I don't like waiting in line for food (I tend to get hangry) especially if is the first meal of the day (dim sum is a typical brunch item).
I can put up with a \"nothing special\" quality of food if I don't have to wait for the table and if it is cheap. Most staff is not good at English, but you can still manage to order by looking at the pictures and English name for items (you have to ask for it if you need it). 

Overall, I like dim sum because it is cheap, filling, and fun to try different dishes. This place has done enough for me to come back. I would recommend this place if you can manage to get an early bird deal or don't want to wait in line.

Dinner: 

Good food (just typical Chinese dishes for dinner), quick and friendly service, reasonable price. Our group ordered quite a lot (about 10 different dishes) almost everything was pretty tasty. My favorite was stir-fried green beans and fried lobsters. Their eel casserole was OK, a bit too chewy."}
{"text":"Classy and fancy it ain't. Small it is. Go real early (8 AM) on a weekend and you get only one or two servers. But surprisingly the food is good. Just don't come with a big group of folks. Max per average big table is six persons."}
{"text":"My friend told me they are quite cheap and the food is good, so we tried this place. I like the dough and congee. The food was average for a Dim Sum place. The price is quite reasonable and waiters are attentive. Will come back since I like the dough with my soya milk. 
Btw, I ordered lots take out food and they gave a big box to carry it. It only costs $40 for a big box of food....then I used the box to store recycling. 
The Peking Duck is not authentic at all...only suggest the Dim Sum there. 
Good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place! Very low key and run down and miminal seating. But the food was great! Everything is made and steamed right to order. The rice rolls were so smooth and soft, taste was excellent!! Ha Gao, Shrimp Dumplings are large and tasty! Overall, the food was excellent. Would definitely come back for the food!"}
{"text":"Cheap and decent dim sum regardless of whether you go in the morning or afternoon (price difference isn't that big).  The restaurant is located across from Steam House and it's a bit shabby-looking on the inside.  Didn't seem like the restaurant owner wanted to put it through renovations.  The name of the restaurant is a bit confusing because it's not quite a bar.  The food is decent quality for the price, no complaints so far, will come back!"}
{"text":"This place lost 2 stars for me. Reasons will be covered in a bit. Came here on the weekend, Sunday to be exact, was crowded and staff were mad dashing to clear a table for me and my date. Although, I hated that they assume that we speak Chinese until they realized my hand signals meant I didn't understand. Anyways, we ordered a lot, see the pictures for what we ordered.

The food came out fairly quickly, still hating on the damn teapots, it's like every. standard. dim. sum. place. freaking overfills the pot to the point where they're not pour-able without spilling all of it all over the tablecloth. Food was good, really like the spring rolls and the squid tenacles, others are so so. One item was mislabeled as meat and veggie dumpling and ummm there was no meat in it...what the hell. Oh and one menu item we ordered, never came out. I wanted my shrimp siu mai, people!

Pros:
- Fast, effective service
- English menu to help non-Chinese speakers order

Cons:
- Not all food ordered came out
- Overfilled teapots
- Tip separated from bill and cashier demanded tip when I had no change left for tip."}
{"text":"I was invited out for dim sum to celebrate a friend's birthday. She told me the location and I was a bit puzzled. Many restaurants, including St. Hubert and Daybreak have occupied space in that building. I don't recall ever seeing a Chinese restaurant there. Curious, I headed there for 1pm.

The parking lot was empty and the building looked broken and abandoned. Was I in the right place? I spotted my friends just inside the entrance to the foyer separating two restaurants. I guess this is the right place. Milliken Bar and Restaurant? Not a name I would have associated with a Chinese restaurant, especially one that serves dim sum and is open 24 hours. Looking around, I had doubts. It was seriously in need of a makeover.

We ordered, and ordered, LOTS of food. It came really quickly. Everything was served hot and it tasted good, better than average. Hmmm, who would have thought?

I have no idea how much it cost since I didn't get a chance to pay but I can only assume it was cheap, based on comments from other reviewers. I may have to come back. With friends. For the food. Not the decor.

Happy birthday, Tanya!"}
{"text":"This is currently my parents new favourite restaurant. 

We come here in the morning for dim sum. They are not the cart pushing type of dim sum, it is order off of the sheet. Dim sum is not bad and not expensive either.

We also frequent the dinner scene. Their set dinner menu is not bad. We typically order a 6 dish menu and it's big enough to feed a family of 9 with leftovers. 

Overall, food is pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"FOOD - 5 STARS
DECOR - 2 STARS
SERVICE - 4 STARS

This place is a bit of a hole in the wall. The parking lot was pretty empty when we got there...but it was also 10am on a Friday. The decor was quite old school and they gave us a menu with only chinese writing. So I felt kinda awkward at first. We asked for an English menu and it was perfect. It came with pictures of the food which was helpful. The main host lady was very polite and friendly. I give points for her saying \"Thank you\" when we left and reminded us to take our belongings and leftovers.

We ordered 13 items and the first dish that came were the egg tarts. They looked ok but after the first bite I was like omg...so flakey!! That's when you know it's a good egg tart. The congee with preserved egg and pork was amazing; great consistency, it is not watered down like some places. 

We ordered the usual, haw gow, Sui Mai,  chicken feet, rice roll (cheung fun), etc. The quality is very good and taste delicious. I will definitely come back again...maybe next week!"}
{"text":"Nope, it's definitely not a bar, although it does have beer and wine.

This place is considerably less busier than Steam House located across from this restaurant in the same building, but it has its own target of customers here. It's also somewhat cheaper than Steam House, and the design is a bit less modern (mainly because this place has been around longer I assume).

I ordered the special dinner for 6, but added a pigeon order and another kind of fish which I forgot. The starter soup, crispy chicken, steamed fish, and sweet/sour pork all tasted very good. The beef vegetable and vancouver crab was meh at best, and the bean curd was on the disappointing side, as none of us expected it to be fried (which honestly ruins the taste). In terms of the other items outside the combo, the pigeon tasted very good, and we even ordered a second one to take home! The fish which I forgot its name...was definitely regretting as it was tough to chew.

For $59.80 for the original 6 dishes, there's definitely good value in it. It's definitely not the best Chinese food I've eaten, but I can't argue given the price (and the free soup and dessert that came along). Service, however, definitely could be better, as I honestly believe everyone should be trained to at least take down our food orders, but only the captains/managers were allowed to, and it seemed the waiters/waitresses outnumber them almost 2 to 1."}
{"text":"I decided to give Milliken Bar and Restaurant a try after seeing it advertise 24/7 Dim Sum. I went in at about 3pm and ordered some food. It came fairly quickly and the portions were decent. I ordered the shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice roll, dough fritter rice roll, deep fried shrimp dumplings, Korean ribs, pork dumpling and finished off with a mango pudding for dessert. It came to 25.00 for 10 plates! Best value I've gotten at a dim sum place in a while. The quality of the dim sum was good. Well priced and the portions were great too. Well definitely come back! Though the name is misleading, it really is a hidden gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Milliken Bar & Restaurant is all about value.  A decent meal at a good price.

Pros:
Cheap early bird dim sum special
Variety of set meals at good prices

Cons:
Nothing spectacular

I've now come here for both dim sum in the morning and dinner in the evening.  There early bird special is one of the cheapest I've seen in the city.  $1.80 before 11am and only $2.20 after.  There are dim sum places with early bird specials much more expensive than their regular prices.  The dim sum is fairly decent, specially for the price.  It won't ever be the best, but it's more than good enough for what you're paying.  

Dinner offers a lot more in choice here.  You can just pick and choose from the menu or you can order from their many set menus the offer.  Most of these offer some sort of seafood along with several dishes for a very good price in my opinion.  Dinner for 6 with seafood dishes will be a little over $10 a person which is very good.  The dishes themselves again are more than good enough for what you're paying.  There are little things like the beef tenderloin could of been more tender but like I said, more than fair for what you're paying.  All food orders also come with free soup and dessert, more value!!

The service here is very good.  The staff are all friendly and try to get things done quickly.  I've never had a disappointing time here in any of the times I've come.  Give this place a try if you're looking for cheap dim sum or a nice meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the early morning dim sum special. $1.80 before 11am on weekdays and $2.20 afterwards. Arrived around 10 for a large party and was immediately seated. Service was pretty good but the food came out a little too slow. I liked how we were able to order what we  wanted rather than wait for carts to be rolled out. Everything tasted pretty decent, I definitely recommend the rice noodle rolls!"}
{"text":"I brought my grandma and family to this restaurant for a nice Chinese dinner. We ordered a full table of food, and we discovered two dishes that were not up to par. 

The first was an oyster hot pot, where several oysters were not fresh, and had a prominent stench to it. The second was a mapo tofu (where we asked for no spice) and the tofu had evidently gone bad and tasted sour. 

We reported these two dishes to restaurant management, who removed it from our table to take to the kitchen, only to come back out and refuse any responsibility. 

Instead, they placed the blame on my family for having \"different tastes\" because other tables ordered mapo tofu and had no issues. Well, everyone else ordered mapo tofu with the spicy sauce, which covered the sour taste -- our dish was not spicy and we got the true taste of their \"fresh\" ingredients. 

If your ingredients have gone wrong - at least own up to it. We did them a favour by bringing it to their attention, and they responded with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"I use to like it alot, the prices has gone up. It is now 2.20 a plate 8am to 11am and 2.50 a plate for the other times. The food is alright. There is no wait to get a table nor is there a long wait to get the food. 

It is also opened 24 hrs now."}
{"text":"Strangely decorated place. Kinda like they went into a gift shop and randomly bought shit and then put them on the walls for unknown reasons. But the food isn't too bad. It's affordable and tasty and come out pretty quickly. The service is slightly better than what you'd expect at a Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"How would one expected that Milliken Bar and Restaurant would be serving Dim Sum and Roast Duck?? 

I was expecting some fancy Martini or Craft beer when I dropped by for lunch today.. and I was given a dim sum menu... 

Dim Sum $2 all size all day... not a bad deal... Nothing too fancy on the menu but all the items are made to order so quite decent.

The service here is friendly.. overfriendly... especially when our waiter gave us some pickup lines...

The dim sum are standard... nothing to write home about but at least the restaurant itself is quite spacious and clean.

FYI, this location before it is a Chinese restaurant was a BAR! I guess they just kept the old name!"}
{"text":"i guess i will give this place 4 stars... mainly because its a good value.

less line ups than other chinese restaurants.. taste is comparable.. but obviously cant compete with omei or any fancy shmancy place...  did i mention.. price is not too bad?

i come here for dimsum very often.. its always my back up dimsum place if others are jammed pack."}
{"text":"Miliken Restaurant & Bar is a cheap and decent dim sum restaurant in the Scarborough area. Prices are $2.10 for all dishes during the week and $2.40 for the weekend. I live awfully close to the restaurant so I also appreciate the convenience.

Some of my favourites here include:

Deep fried taro dumpling
Korean style short ribs
Deep fried meat dumpling- the slightly sweetened glutinous exterior was thick and had a nice, chewy texture
Rice noodle roll-wrapped Crispy Dough- surprisingly refined and delicious
Egg tarts
Sesame dumpling with bitter melon and salted egg yolk- a very interesting dessert. The bitter melon is very subtle and I could hardly taste it.

All in all, not a bad place for cheap dim sum. I'd come during the week if possible to avoid the weekend crowd (and price premium). But on the weekends, the servers circulate around holding dishes that are not on the menu, and these items are not available during the week. I always like to see what they bring out (and it's usually quite enticing), so I try not to order so much from the regular menu and save some room for these special items."}
