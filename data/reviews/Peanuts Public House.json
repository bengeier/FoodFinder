{"text":"Used to come here quite often - back in the day lol I'm torn.....the renos are a great improvement and the atmosphere is fun yet relaxed. The steak sandwich though has been destroyed! Shoestring fries with enough salt to kill leeches. Steak sandwich was a fair size/thickness. The chef can cook a med-rare steak, but killed it and any juices left with seasoning salt sprinkled after! The garlic toast was so dry around the edges, I actually didn't eat it. You could tell it was stale.  Caesar salad was old - lettuce soggy and dense. Flavour decent though. Helped with the salt factor if nothing else.  Had a \"purple gas\" pint (Big Rock) - was fabulous! Waitress was also fabulous! Might give this another chance. Maybe.  Not for dinner though, I don't think."}
{"text":"The free peanuts are awesome, and they have a decent selection of draft beer, including Big Rock IPA, which you don't typically find on draft. The food menu is fairly small and the food is just average pub grub. The steak sandwich is a good value, but the steaks are very thin and hard to cook rare (which is how I like mine). I just went there with a group of friends and we had awesome service. The waitress came around frequently and we were never without drinks. The atmosphere was pretty fun - very relaxing, but feels upbeat. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best steak sandwiches in town. It's always packed and the floors are covered in, well, peanuts, of course. The steak sandwich draws people from all over town here because of the cheap price and the quality. It always seems full of peanut-munching soccer hooligans as well. They broadcast a lot of soccer games on their big screens. All of it together is somewhat reminiscent of an authentic English pub. Great place to go for a beer, nuts and a steak sandwich...."}
{"text":"The draft beer selection here is pretty good, and it's a nice busy pub so it's a good place to drink. The food, however, isn't very good at all. The \"peanuts burger\" (or whatever it's called) is made from a frozen hockey puck, and is SO DRY that you can hardly swallow it. I almost had to dip it in my beer to eat it. They also give you a little dish of ketchup (not a bottle), so it's impossible to add ketchup to the burger to to moisten it up a little. They could solve this problem by using fresh hamburger instead of that frozen crap - or if they insist on frozen, using a better quality product. My friend had the \"famous\" steak sandwich, which consisted of a crappy thin-looking piece of steak. I would never order it after seeing that LOL."}
{"text":"Awesome pub inside the carriage house hotel, I had only been once and the next time I came in the bartender actually remembered me from the previous time which is always impressive, they have a great beer selection and the steak sandwich is yummy and they have the best carder  salad ever !"}
{"text":"Looked like a great place and it wasn't too busy for a Friday night so our group of 8 grabbed a table. Unfortunately the table had left over plates on them but the waitress quickly ran by stating that she would be right back to take the dishes away. 10 mins later dishes are still there and she hasn't even come by to ask for our drink order so I decide to move the plates myself onto another empty table also filled with dirty dishes. She comes by the table beside us to collect their payment and gets flagged by someone else asking about their salads they ordered awhile back (starting to see a trend here) she talks to them briefly and then leaves again without even acknowledging us. After 20 mins of waiting with zero service we walked out. Forget this place....we want service please."}
{"text":"I think Christopher W. Said it all in his review.  If you're coming here you need to get the steak sandwich.  Peanut's is a lively place to hang out and watch the game with some nuts while you munch on some nuts."}
{"text":"Haven't been to peanuts in probably a year but went today and was VERY pleasantly surprised. They completely revamped the whole place and must have done $500k+ in renos. The steak sandwich was awesome and they improved the salad and rest of the menu from the looks of it. Steak sandwich is $8.95 all the time so you can't beat the price for what you get! I would recommend anyone go there and check it out."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's party. Waitress was attentive and place seemed nice enough. Typical bar. Ordered the dorito crusted chicken strips. Everyone at the table commented on how gross the chicken looked....Gray and rubbery, like it was way past its prime. Despite this, I tried it anyway. Much as expected, it was disgusting and I sent it back without ordering anything else. Luckily the Waitress did not charge for the dish as I would have been a little upset otherwise. My husband and I continued to drink our beers and then went to Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner after the party instead. We likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Located inside the Carriage House Inn, this renovated restaurant has all the goods but there weren't any patrons.  It wasn't that late on a Tuesday evening but the place was empty. Sat myself at the bar and order a drink and a jerk chicken sandwich with a salad.  The young gal took my order and put a small three sectioned small plate in front of me with three different flavoured peanuts. After my first brew, I asked why the place was called \"Peanuts.\"  The server chuckles and looks down at the dish in front of me...Uh...I'm not so bright right?  For those of you not following - she did serve me a bunch of peanuts when I sat down.  She told me that since the place opened, peanuts were served and thrown all over the floor nightly.  Now the peanuts come shelled and flavoured.  Easier to clean up that way - I guess. The jerk chicken sandwich was fine, the salad was a bit wilted (not a lot of people ordering veggies).   The bathroom was funny as it had kegs for sinks...see pix.  Wondered why my brew tasted funny!  Awwh..NUTS!"}
{"text":"Stayed a couple days in Calgary on business. Very friendly staff. Beer's cold...good food. Great Canadian accents too eh."}
