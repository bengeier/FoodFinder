{"text":"Loooove this place :). Awesome service, always smiling and making jokes. I have a sensitive stomach, but I never feel yucky after eating this pizza. Even when the line up is outside the door it still moves quickly. Some of my favorites are the bbq chicken pizza, and their tomatoe bisque is so hearty and definitely one of my comfort foods. It's a great restaurant in a great location that I always find myself coming back to. Only thing that I could say that's not positive about this place is one time the salad I ordered was doused in dressing and the leaves were soggy, so ever since then I order it on the side and it's been fine :)!"}
{"text":"This restaurant rocks. The staff are friendly, the food is delicious, and the pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"Have seen this place for while, finally!!! That I went there yesterday for dinner. They have specials on different day thought out the week, like yesterday was Wednesday, you get $2off on any 9oz wine and $10 off for a bottle of wine. They also have happy hour till 6pm( if I am wrong, cannot remember the starting time) we ordered 2 small pizza(7') just wanna try out two flavours, but I would recommend ppl getting the larger size(11')."}
{"text":"We've picked up pizza once here and had 2 dining experiences.  Both were wonderful, love, love, love the pizza!  Their limoncello in a pitcher is also yummy! :)  Like the open atmosphere."}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant has recently opened, we found the level of service and food more than met our expectations.  Ordering is done at the counter and after that full service at your table.  Our group had a couple different mini pizza/salad combos, a full pizza and a sandwich from pizza dough something like a calzone - all speedy, fresh and delicious.  The basil mojito was a great twist, others had Italian beer and Italian soda. The glelatos were delicious. There are many interesting pizzas to choose from so we will be back.  The restaurant is bigger than the other in Calgary and was very busy- a good sign!"}
{"text":"The pizza sauce is straight up Flavorless crushed tomatoes without any seasoning? Our server must have been new but there were enough people asking if things were ok that we go what we needed."}
{"text":"Great service very friendly always making sure your drinks are full and your meal is good. Tomato bisque so good!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this yummy Italian pizzeria and  have never been disappointed. The food is amazing, the prices are great and the service is exceptional. Not to mention the owner is a great guy and treats all of his patrons wonderfully. 
Great addition to Mackenzie towne!"}
{"text":"Been to this Famoso three times the past month and a half. Each time my wife and I have been impressed with the entire operation...from the polite, courteous and upbeat staff to the delicious food, great atmosphere, this has become our go to place.

We would totally recommend it and caters to all ages. It is a perfect spot for a date or an outing with the family."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not many places in Calgary that do this type of pizza. Really busy on weekends though. They have already outgrown the space and needs to expand. Worth the wait though. My wife loves their chocolate banana desert."}
{"text":"This is an amazing location of the pizzeria chain. Here, Adam the manager runs a tight ship, and al the staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and hey have an amazing selection of Italian foods, pastas and salads. 
I have had just about everything on their menus, and I can say with confidence that you cannot go wrong. My girlfriend has many allergies, including gluten, dairy and egg. They offer a ton of allergy aware options and are very accommodating to requests. FYI, they have crust that is gluten dairy and egg free. 
Hands down, our experience here was the best we've had and we would highly recommend Famoso Mckenzie Towne to anyone, especially those with the allergies mentioned above."}
{"text":"Their tomato bisque is my comfort food. A local favourite for our family, and they are wonderful with our kids."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly and efficient staff. I always have a great time dining here. Especially nice on hot summer nights when the doors can be fully opened to the street. Each time the manager on duty came over to say hi and check on things. Although it does get lined up at times it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town you get to choose your toppings add or remove any from existing pizza which is always a bonus to be able to customize is always awesome. We went one night and got in right away and the service was super fast! The server knew everything on the menu and gave us some suggestions. We were also lucky enough to have other customers give us a coupon for 50% off our entire bill which was a huge bonus. I really love this place and would go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I tried the new Mu-shu bbq duck pizza and was blown away! Super delicious thin crust with sweet sauce. I tried a few different red wines and had a slice of my friend's siciliana, also good. The evening was paired off with a dixie cup of vanilla bean gelato! Molto bene!

Such a cool environment & unique pizzeria concept. I could have just hung out there for hours in this neighborhood spot. Great, attentive service as well.

I love this place and can see why everyone's been raving about it! Can't wait to try the one in the city."}
{"text":"I find this location to be more spacious then the others which is nice. It attracts more families with kids so it has a different vibe to it. The service and food has been adequate over-all.. The downtown (4rth street) location has been the best in regards to food and service, so I am more inclined to return there. If I had young kids I could imagine this being a more suitable option."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for Famoso, and decided to use it this past Saturday evening. I phoned to make a reservation, and the girl who answered the phone said they didn't take reservations unless you had a party of more than 6. I was a party of four, and it was just past 5 P.M. I asked if it was busy yet, and she said that it shouldn't be a problem being seated. We arrived around 5:30, and it was busy We did get a table right away though.
After being seated the server  explained what we could order as part of the Groupon voucher.
You get one of the appetizers, except for the most expensive one which eludes me at this time. If I recall I think it may have been meatballs ? You also get to choose one seasonal pizza (which I think there were three or 4 options), and one permanent pizza.
We ordered at the front of the restaurant, and also ordered our drinks.
The drinks and pizza came out very quickly. We had one cheese pizza, (boring I know). The kids like it plain. The other one was a duck and ? pizza. I think it was like a mushu duck flavored pizza with duck meat and cilantro and hoisen sauce ?
It all tasted very good if I had to say anything bad, is that my duck meat had a small duck bone in it.  

I will definitely return to Famoso in the future. Great taste, fast service and busy.

Get there early if you can for dinner.

It had a little line-up upon leaving at around 6:20 P.M."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a date night. Had no reservation so and there was a wedding party so had to wait quite some time but the food was delicious"}
{"text":"Glad Brewsters was full because we walked over here. Great ambiance walking in. Greeted with friendly host/ man in charge. 

I ordered the Don Andreas because I was craving avocados and cilantro together. That pizza was on my table in about 6 minutes and cooked perfectly. It was angels singing in my mouth. Unreal food. Going back again and again."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pizza ever. Management is fantastic at this location, I've had multiple wonderful experiences dining here. The Gorgonzola walnut salad is to die for and there's literally no pizza I can say I hate."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and wine at a decent price. But there are no walls with lots of kids. Very loud."}
{"text":"I'm more of a classic \"old school\" type of guy so after reading the menu I'm left wondering will what I picked taste any good? And it certainly always does. They really do have some unique pizza flavours. It's definitely not the order in pizza you might be used to, it's usually thin, almost no sauce, but somehow the crust and toppings taste great. Definitely recommend, with family or for a date night, works for either."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, very accommodating and enthusiastic!!! And so is the food!!! I absolutely love the options they have on the menu. Definitely will be coming here more and more."}
{"text":"A beautiful neighbourhood pizzeria nestled in the community of McKenzie Towne, Famoso is one of those great little places to grab some quality eats. The large open concept dining area is alive with the sounds of cooking, clinking glassware and conversation. This casual eatery serves up some impressive pizza in the famous Napoli style with the thin, wood fired crust that cooks up in literally seconds.

The pizza selection is a nice variety from the tried and true traditional to some more contemporary flavours like the Cavoletti which features Bianca sauce, fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto crisps, gorgonzola cheese, dates, walnuts, and a drizzle of honey. The flavours and ingredients are fresh and imaginative, leaving an unforgettable impression.

For starters, we tried the tapenade trio and were quite surprised by the generous portions. The flavours were popping from the saltiness of the Kalamata olive tapenade and move down the spectrum to a roasted artichoke tapenade and finish with the slight sweetness of the fresh bruschetta. 

Service is good and the runners are very attentive to your needs. Upon arriving at your table, you select your items, then make your order at the main counter. Food is then brought to your table. As the meal progresses, however, the runners are more than happy to bring you any additional items you may want to order.

It's great to see a quality pizzeria in the South that's close to home. I would highly recommend you give it a try. You'll be very pleased."}
{"text":"With high excitement over a new restaurant in our neighborhood, we headed to Famoso in Mckenzie Towne for dinner tonight. Sadly though, our experience doesn't live up to the hype. Although the decor is nice, this restaurant is small and very noisy - it's hard to hold a conversation with the person next to you. There is only one washroom per gender so people end up lining up in front of your table (if you're seated near the back). The staff are generally nice but young, inexperienced and did not explain the process - that you must go to the till to order - clearly.  Most disappointing was that our food came all at different times (10 minutes apart) and neither the server nor the manager seemed to care, and then the wrong orders were brought. Although the food was enjoyable (when it arrived), the service was poor and the staff failed to make a good impression on this customer. I'll be waiting a while for the kinks to be worked out before I return, if ever."}
{"text":"Being a fan of deep dish thick crust pizza, famoso is very different for me. I must say I'd prefer a 'real' pizza but I absolutely love famoso. Great prices, great service. I recommend the Mediterranean flat bread, mmmm."}
{"text":"This place is great for kids and families! However, it is also a great place for a simple yet sophisticated pizza!! The staff had trouble when we sat down! Our expectations are simple but, at the least, expected."}
{"text":"I believe this place is under new management, as standards have recently dropped significantly. Famoso used to be a go-to for me. My last two visits have resulted in quite bad experiences, so I'll likely stop going.

A word of advice for restaurants: yes, I know in take out situations, there isn't as much opportunity to resolve problems. However, there's still some expectation of honesty. Be honest with the customer. We ordered two pizzas recently, both of which were missing toppings and had substitutions, and were made late despite it not being fairly busy. Spinach, by the way, is not exactly a 1:1 replacement for arugula. Also, leaving out protein based ingredients is pretty weak for value reasons. One pizza was undercooked and the other was so sparsely topped it may as well been margherita.  None of this is necessarily a problem, as long as it would be made aware to me during pick up. 

I see people checking their pickup orders before leaving. I've never been one to do that because it seems slightly rude. But now I see why, and I feel that it is a bit unfortunate that you'd have to do that here. To have the staff cheerfully hand me my order and receive payment, knowing the order was significantly compromised, is not ok. I'm not mad, Famoso. I'm disappointed. It gets a 3 star for my previous experiences being so good. Hopefully the staff turn it around."}
{"text":"Went there just by chance and it was a great idea! My wife and I ordered a couple of pizzas, one had prosciutto, ham and mushrooms and the other dried tomatoes. Great experience, great service and friendly atmosphere. Order was served pretty fast too. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mission location, so was very happy to learn there is a Famoso in the SE closer to my new home. I had never been into McKenzie Towne before - Famoso is located on the High Street, which might just been the most adorable little street in Calgary.

Depending on the time you arrive, you may or may not have to wait. This location is also more family-friendly than the downtown location, so I would not recommend if you don't want to dine around young children.

The service is pretty quick, good wine menu, and the pizzas are some of the best in Calgary - thin crust, fresh ingredients, authentic Napolitana.  

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a pizza place and only a pizza place unfortunately. I come here quite often as I live in the area and get pizza overtime and it is fantastic. Especially their summer pizzas such as one that had prawns on it! 
I decided to switch things up and get the pistachio penne pasta. I was very disappointed with the pasta because there was hardly any sauce on it so it was very dry. I asked the waitress about this and it turns out that the pasta was supposed to have no pasta on it which is how it was served, it is only served with some oil on the noodles. 
I was also surprised because in the title it says it is a PENNE pasta so I assumed there would be penne noodles.. however it was served with linguini noodles and when I asked the waitress she said that if you want specific noodles you have to ask for them. SO I would not recommend getting a pasta here but definitely pizza.
I like that they support local businesses such as supporting Fiasco Gelato with serving their gelato at this location and making deserts with it :)"}
{"text":"The food is consistent here. Always good. Last time we went, we were told 10 minutes for our order, so we show up 10 minutes later. We end up waiting for another 20. Not a big deal, it was a friday night and it was packed. The manager was so polite and gave us a gift card for waiting, quite the pleasant surprise. She even handled the irate old fella who was yelling at her for having to wait even though he as well got a gift card very well. I can't wait to read your negative review you kept threatening you dusty old douche canoe."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza (must try the cavoleti) and service is always outstanding ! Always busy which says a lot and service is always fast. Manager (I believe) is always present and staff is very friendly ! Great location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice treat every once in a while this is a place to go for say every 2 months due to the price at the end of your visit.
I am giving this restaurant a 4 star review because it was pretty decent if you ask me, but nothing too special.
This place is well known for its pizza, but if you haven't been here before, then you should also know they have sandwiches, and pasta which I have not yet tried.
I had the pepperoni and mushroom pizza that was pretty good, and keep in mind that the sauce is more of a runny consistently, (not as thick as for say a fast food restaurant).
Overall the food here is pretty good and will be coming back again sometime soon, but don't expect to see me as a regular customer.
They also have a gelato counter with various flavors to finish off the meal!"}
{"text":"Willis made my day after a horrible slow drive home on slippery roads. Pizza was made hot and fresh for me after being an hour late for pickup. Defiantly going back to sit down and enjoy the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad pies. A little rushed at times. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Received some very poor service there last night. It was a Monday night the restaurant was mostly empty so there really shouldn't have been much of an excuse for poor service. 

When we arrived we waited at the door to be told that we could seat ourselves. I wish they had some sort of sign posting that told us that. The first girl who greeted us told us that she would just be getting our drink order and that our server would be back to take our pizza order. Our server came along shortly with our drinks but we needed a few more minutes with menu. The last time I went to famoso you wrote your order on a piece of paper and took it to the front to order. After waiting 10 minutes for our server to come back my mother approached the front to order and was told that it was taken at the table. The first girl, who had taken our drink order came over and took our food order. And when the food arrived she grabbed us refills and brought us extra plates. Our server, if you can even call her that, came back to clear our plates and give us the bill. In a last minute attempt to get a better tip she tried chatting with us before we left. 

The food was alright, the tomato bisque wasn't soupy enough and after taking a spoonful the remaining bisque would stay in its same spot in the bowl, and the flatbread while tasty was too greasy and Final comment the kitchen and serveries are open plan in this restaurant which meant we could see our server eating and polishing cutlery while we were waiting to order.

Not great, but not bad. Didn't really understand why we had 2 servers."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! Can definitely get very busy on weekends and the parking is atrocious but not a deal breaker. All the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Food tastes great! Lots to choose from. Their tomato soup is delicious. As well as their marinated olives and their mozza balls. Haven't ordered anything I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty damn good. Fresh and tasty. My wife, who has an issue digesting flour, can actually eat here and not feel sick because of the low gluten flour. We love the atmosphere. If I had one critique it would be the slowness of the staff. 

This is officially our go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria is a Canadian Restaurant. It has so many locations in Canada. One of them is located on 5 High St SE, Calgary in McKenzie Town, which is 5 minutes away from my home. I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend on Friday 24th. We arrived there around 6 pm. Luckily, we got a table there. This place was super busy and full at the dinner time. We ordered two drinks for start. Then, we had  CAULIFLOWER ARTICHOKE DIP NEW,  KOREAN BBQ BEEF PIZZA, and  SOPHIA LOREN Vegetarian plus tomato soup to share for the main meal. The food came out very fast and fresh. But, they were all in small or medium portion. The taste of the food was awesome. Especially, the Korean style BBQ Pizza was super great. I loved it so much. The price of the food was OK (Not cheap). It is a great place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in the burbs, always great service and quality of food. The owner is personable friendly and really makes you feel at home. 
Definitely can't go wrong with the thin crust pizzas of course but there are other great choices like the tomato bisque and meatball sandwich which are to die for. Also love that they serve Lavazza coffee, Italian and delish! If you haven't been don't wait as I assure you it will quickly become one of your fav places to dine."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and apps.  Great service in very cool little \"neighborhood\".  Only complaint is decor is a little sterile.  Tables and chairs have a cafeteria feel to them.  You've gone this far guys, make the place cozy and maybe a little romantic?  Just my 2 cents.  Pizza is a solid 3 1/2, round up to 4 for the great service."}
{"text":"I understand reading the reviews that some people like this style of pizza, but it's not for me. There is no crust, its just a limp mess. Toppings are sparse. Service isn't that great in the beginning and then annoying after you get your food. Keep this garbage, being from Calgary I prefer a greek style pizza. 

I also like thin crust but it should be like cracker, not this mess."}
{"text":"Went to the McKenzie location on a Sunday around 5pm. This was prime time families with little kids hour.  Screaming babies, throwing crayons.  

Ordered the Gorgonzola Walnut Salad full-size order. It came in a regular size bowl and cost $13.00. The most over-priced rip off salad of the year. 

Pizza was good. Service was good. Atmosphere not so great...maybe it's better later hours and weekdays?



Overall, an average experience."}
{"text":"We just moved to McKenzie Towne so we thought we would try it out. This place did not disappoint. Our entire family enjoyed the meal, the environment was relaxing and the service was exceptional. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Definitely has the proper Italian vibe, with pretty good pizza. Nice decor and good Italian soda. I would like to go back and try more of the menu to get a better feel of the place."}
{"text":"Always love famoso! It's great for big groups and I'm in love with their prosciutto arugula. And they carry fiasco gelato!!! The salted caramel is to die for and even better it's local!"}
{"text":"Famoso's pizza oven looks like a helmet for the Boston Red Sox.  That might have been intentional.  It also dramatically illustrates the chain roots behind the veneer of a classic pizzeria. This is not a criticism, more of a disclaimer.  From the inset, Famoso resembles similar places like Boston Pizza or Mr. Mikes. Its menu appears pulled from some template all of them seemingly pull from.  However, look past this into the exposed kitchen, and one finds the chefs stretching dough, layering ingredients, and blasting the results in an oven replicating the surface of Venus.  So despite all the hallmarks of pre-processing, cookie-cutting, and factor shipping, Famoso rises above to be actually decent.  Hell, it's borderline acceptable.  One must admit the dough is probably brought in--that a warehouse somewhere in Calgary packages the sauces, cheeses, and meats, then coats them in stabilizers and squeezes them into vacuum-packages and frozen until needed.  That's just common sense.  But everything else looks legit.  Even the décor throws a curve ball once in a while, sporting an actual wine rack.  

             To start our experience, we opened with the prosciutto-wrapped mozza balls-Fior-di-latte wrapped with prosciutto, baked in Campania tomato sauce with fresh basil and Grana Padano. Served with flatbread. Their words, and I love the fact they all use \"Grana Padano\" rather than just ordinary parmesan, like they are too good for it.  \"No, no, we don't denigrate our pizzas with that Reggiano crap.\"  Maybe they think we all associate parmesan with that refuse shaken from that green container.  Like hatchbacks, duplex homes, and web television--certain names have been stigmatized, forcing a slight variation and justifying a newer, fancier name.  It's better because it's a crossover SUV, a \"paired\" home, and a VLOG.  And this is Grana Padano, not parmesan.  The tomato sauce was unspectacular, and resembled that of Boston Pizza.  Thankfully the following pizzas delivered and justified one's reason for visiting in the first place.  You don't go to a place with a dominating and signature pizza oven and then order a pasta.  It's like going to a Formula 1 race with earmuffs on.  It's like going to a fight club and not fighting--it's the FINAL rule!

             So yeah, we had pizzas, two in fact.  Mine wasn't as good, the Capriccioso-Italian ham, roasted mushrooms, artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, and extra virgin olive oil, while my friend had the Abruzzo-oven-roasted Italian sausage, slivered red onions, roasted mushrooms, fennel seeds, and smoked mozzarella.  His was good.  My issue was just the combination wasn't to my liking; it had nothing to do with the quality of ingredients.  The pizza crust was astounding.  I want to return and sample a few more varieties, something I NEVER utter concerning Boston Pizza.  Famoso is remarkably good, with pleasant staff that immediately jumped to attention when they discovered my pizza was uncut.  I thought they were being traditional.  In Italy, you gotta tear that pizza with your hands--cutters are for wimps without any strength.  I mean...I heard.  

             I remember that despicable advertisement Boston Pizza ran a few years back when they insinuated \"foodie\" was an F-word.  Famoso is a giant middle-finger to that campaign, that a chain can offer westernized food in a non-westernized environment, or at the very least offer an olive branch to traditional Italian pizzerias.  I mean, it'll never be Il Pizzaiolo del Presidente (yes, I looked it up), but nothing truly will be.  I remember a quote from my best friend when he compared his microbus to a friend's Lada, admitting that the VW wasn't that much better, but it still was.  Famoso isn't that much better than Boston Pizza, Freshslice, Panago, or Pizza Pizza, but it is.

{"text":"Love going here.  When this location first opened I was a little underwhelmed but since they have been open now for a few months the service and food has improved 100%.  Pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Mediocre - just don't order the \"special\": I went here for lunch this week (excited since I had just been to the location in mission recently and had a fantastic experience) 
First dislike, that you need to go up to the counter to order. For most people this isn't a problem. For the mom of a very active baby standing in the queue for any period of time is not a good idea. 
The restaurant itself is lovely, we sat by the open window on a warm day. 
Food arrived fairly promptly. I had ordered the special which was a margarita pizza. It was disappointing to say the least. There was hardly any cheese (the only topping) on the pizza. It was bland beyond belief. 
The pizzas ordered by my friends looked much more desirable and much like the food I had enjoyed recently at the other location. 
I'm not sure if the quality was due to the special or the selected pizza but I would not be tempted to try again."}
{"text":"I just had my first visit to Famoso and I really liked the bright, open atmosphere.  I have to say that the service was rather slow, which was disappointing, especially considering that it was a weekday at 11:30am.  

I ordered the Sweet BBQ Chicken personal size pizza and it was more than enough for lunch.  It seems as though there aren't a lot of ingredients but they're packed with flavor.  I ordered the Nutella Mocha and that is desert all in itself.  This is absolutely delicious and I should have asked if it's possible to order it to go.  If I were in the neighborhood and in need of a boost, I'd order this beverage over the mocha at the nearby Starbucks.  

It actually feels like a treat to roll up to a decent restaurant and park without hassle these days.  There's tons of parking in the area."}
{"text":"A great addition to the McKenzie Towne/High Street area!
Who doesn't love pizza, seriously.  The TMNT themselves would love this place although Splinter would not be allowed to dine per section blah blah blah of the Health Blah Code.
This is definitely a family friendly restaurant, not in the Denny's way, but more in the Suburby-Minivan-driving way.  The servers share the work and seem to be pretty good at keeping on top of things.
This is a little different from most restaurants as you enter, sit, choose what you want, and then order from the cash.  The food and drinks , appies and desserts arrive accordingly with someone always stepping in to clear plates.
They have a delicious assortment of Gelato (including Eggnog now!!!) and if you have no room , why not take home a pint for later!
The pizza is delicious with very fresh, Italian flavours.  Not gonna lie, I'm a big fan.  It's a fun escape for a couple in the burbs who don't feel like having Kraft Dinner and ketchup again. 
Oh man, now I want Kraft Dinner and ketchup.  Damnit Megs."}
{"text":"This is one of those instances where \"I shudda quit while I was ahead!\" The service was very good and the appetizer (prosciutto wrapped mozzarella balls) was outstanding. You're all worked up for the main dish (abruzzo pizza) prepared by their \"expert pizziaolos\" and that's where the curtain fell (sans applause!) Totally lacking in flavour that no amount of Parmesan cheese and chill flakes sprinkled could save! Too bad...
The dessert took it back up a notch thank God! Would I eat here again? Sure. I mean they can make a flavourful dish (appetizer) right? No more pizzas for me though. That's one page of the menu Im skipping for certain!"}
{"text":"Famoso is pretty good! The pizza is good, prices are good, the environment is cute and the service has been wonderful. It is a pretty family oriented place so it can get a little noisy but other than that it's a nice place to go once in awhile."}
{"text":"We like this little Neighborhood spot!  The wood fired pizzas are really tasty, the salads great, and the service hasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with family while visiting Calgary. It's very clean and decorated nicely. The pizza oven is a beautiful feature. Drink selection and specials are good.  Food was small in portion, you will be hungry later. Service was ok."}
{"text":"The Mckenzie Towne location was still super busy at around 9pm on a Friday night.  Packed full of families, and groups.    
I really enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere; going up to the counter to order.

The pizza was traditional and the toppings were tasty but a bit stingy.   I loved the authentic Italian beverages they had on menu as well.

Nice atmosphere and overall an affordable dining experience."}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken pizza is to die for, I used to get the Margareta pizza but once I stumbled upon the BBQ chicken I had found an all time favourite. I love the innovative way of ordering so you aren't waiting for someone or constantly being bothered to see if you are ready to order. The open kitchen is a plus for me cause I like to see that my food is cooked in a clean environment - which their kitchen is always neat and tidy. The food is always fast and the gelato.... The gelato is amazing. The flavours are diverse and so yummy. Go visit for sure."}
