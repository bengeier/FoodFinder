{"text":"If you have any lebanese friends you probably know that they are all self proclaimed  experts on all things lebanese.....I am no exception to this..

I've tried different chicken shishtawouks from across the globe, from my mommas homemade ones, freshly made ones in lebanon, to even dodgy 'chicken' ones in SE asia.  The reason why Tazza is my second favorite is because it tastes like no one elses, so once you get hooked there's really no substitute...Try the Najib Special and you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for an affordable and delicious lunch...I had the Chicken Shish, a very yummy chicken kabob loaded with all the fixings wrapped up neatly in a warm pita. 

The service is friendly and I admired the little lady behind the counter when she would see a regular and remember their name...now that is something you don't see everyday! 

The Tabouli Salad is so tasty and a perfect side if you are sharing a Shawarma with a pal. They also cater, so for those having a lunch meeting, this will be a big hit! 

Note* Have some breath mints or gum on hand to counteract the garlic!  

I will continue to be a random drop in customer at Tazza, maybe one day they will ask me my name:)"}
{"text":"Tazza is located in Bridgeland, and is owned by a Lebanese family, who are an awesome bunch of characters! They know all their regulars by name, and have a very family like atmopshere.This is the closest to homemade food you can get. I really love the fatayer, they have spinach, chicken and beef. I also recoomend the kibbeh, and tabouleh salad. There's small area to sit down and eat your food, as well as a patio, where they have some small shows in summer."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  When we told them we had dietary restrictions, they substituted sides for no charge.  Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Lebanese food in the city. A family run restaurant, with great service, the food is fresh and healthy and the patio is nice in the summer. Prices are very affordable. I am especially in love with the fatayer and tabouli(which is made the right way, with finely minces ingredients, no big chunks, or too much bulgur to substitute the greens)"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff with home cooked food and great shawarmas.  Much better than A&A as they don't overload the meat with sauces.  Shawarmas have a nice chargrilled flavor and it makes a very healthy meal if you get the platters to share or the shawarma salads without the pita."}
{"text":"Bad experience ,it's called Tazza (that means fresh )but nothing is fresh 
all the veggie looks soggy and it's not fresh at all ,i had a stomach ache after i ate the shawerma sandwich......also the staff is very rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Just moved into Bridgeland and have finally had a chance to try Tazza. Had the chicken wrap which was very nice and a suprisingly good MASH drink, grapefruit flavour. Really nice food, if I had any complaint it's only that they close at 6:30."}
{"text":"Great food but a bit pricey for what you get compared to other shawarma places (maybe the \"large\" chicken shistawouk should have more than a sprinkling of chicken in it).  However where they fall short in value, they more than make up for in atmosphere.  Only a few tables but really cool spot.  Better value would make it a 5. #morechikin"}
{"text":"Best falafel wrap ever!  It is so nice to eat food that is prepared from fresh ingredients.  You can tell in the delicious flavor."}
{"text":"Yum, grabbed dinner to go last week on the way out of the city.  I had the falafel wrap and sampled a couple of their baklava's - pistachio and cashew.  Everything was very tasty.  I really enjoyed the baklava, which wasn't crazy sweet like many others I've tried.  Just crispy, with a pleasant sweetness.  The cashew one was my fave, but both were great.  Also got some baba ganoush to munch on later.  Was good, but not fantastic, quite different from most others I've tried.  I also like that they offer some different beverage options other than the typical coke, sprite, root beer etc., such as dry sodas.  They've got a nice little patio area, and some tables in the restaurant as well, if you'd prefer to eat in.  Great place for a quick, yet fresh and tasty meal."}
{"text":"There are lots of vegan options. I don't know how most of them taste, because I always get the falafel wrap which is great. The sauce they put on it is very good."}
{"text":"Always an oasis in the middle of a city thats full of bad shwarma.... Tazza is always fresh and I've never been let down. Rock solid family running this place!  No reason to go anywhere else..."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious - great for takeout or dine in!

I need to say a big THANK YOU to fellow yelpers... Due to your positive reviews, I decided to come here for lunch today.  I was particularly indecisive, so I'm glad Yelp was there to point me in a direction I wouldn't have thought of on my own.

I tried the Chicken Shish Taouk.  The chicken was a generous serving of moist and flavorful gyro meat. It was stuffed into a pita, along with  tabbouleh salad, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickled turnips.  It was seasoned with a garlicky sauce that was really tasty!  My favourite part of the preparation was when he threw the finished pita on a panini press to crisp it up.  It took less than 5 minutes to place my order, and have my food turned out by an efficient assembly line of cheerful Turkish guys.  Awesome!!!  I will definitely be back!   It looked like they were turning out quite a bit of large orders, so this could be an option for your office catering."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of this quaint little Bridgeland gem. The food is always very fresh and the service is always great, even when it's a busier lunch hour rush crowd. Lots of great menu items, although I always go for the Falafel, Beef Shwarma or Chicken Shish. The regular size is usually more than enough, especially since you usually *have* to get at least one of the many Baklava flavours they have by the cash register.

The Dolmades and Fatyers are super delicious as well. In the Summer, the little patio they have is great to hang out on, and right across the street is a good ice cream shop as well.

During Mo'Vember, I visited Tazza and the older gentlemen behind the counter liked my 'stache so much he made me a 'special' shwarma which was totally loaded and about the best one I've ever had there.

Thumbs up."}
{"text":"My wife brought home some food from Tazza today. She ordered two platters that cost about $15 each. The portions of meat in the platters were definitely not worth the amount of money paid. 
The man working there was also rude and did not know the difference between chicken shawarma and chicken shish tawouk and treated my wife like an idiot (she is middle eastern and knows the food).

On top of all this we were probably the most annoyed that they forgot to put the bread in our order! Which we didn't realize until after she got home."}
{"text":"The food at Tazza is some of the best, freshest home made Mediterranean that I have ever had. The atmosphere is relaxed, comfortable with a great decor and local artists work on display.
The Music played is eclectic, hip and really is perfectly matched to the ambiance.
The Traya family who runs Tazza are a bridgeland staple. Ms. Traya holds down with feisty, hard working attitude and Yousef lightens the mood and makes a KILLER Espresso / Americano / Latte.

Definitely check it."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves up a delicious shawarma.  After recently discovering this place, we ended up returning two days in a row.  I added tzatziki to my chicken shawarma the second time and loved it as it made it a little bit sloppier.  It was so good.

I must mention that the baklava was tasty and I was wishing I'd bought two pieces instead of one because we split the one and I really didn't want to do that after I took that first bite.  So the second time, I ordered two of the rolled up cashew flavors and one of the traditional walnut, which is what we had yesterday, and I felt satisfied.  Good stuff! 

The staff are very friendly and patient when explaining some of the menu items because I was totally unfamiliar with this great food.  

I highly recommend Tazza Grill & Deli."}
{"text":"Good shwarmas, the veggies and herbs are always fresh and tasty. Meat is decent too.
My only compliant is that they can't fry falafels fresh to order... WTF??? Why doesn't anyone in calgary do this? I've had falafels all over the world, and they are ALWAYS fried to order. they are supposed to be crispy on the outside, not mushy from being heated in a microwave!!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. There are so many places in this city to get a donair, shawarma or whatever rotisserie meat in a wrap on some combo plate with a dollop of hummous and some greens. But this place is different. This little place in Bridgeland  boasts a stylish and comfortable space, friendly staff and the freshest, most brilliant Middle Eastern food around. 

Fast food is good food when you know what you're looking for and Tazza has a vast array of all the favourites made fresh and ready when you order it. The  ordering process is convenient and streamlined, as you move along the length of the service counter. As you go down the line, you can see the display cases with the selections of fresh salads, dips and sweets. 

My favourite is the Shish Taouk platter. It's a traditional chicken kabob with a healthy and colourful assortment of pickles, salad, pita and creamy hummous for your eating pleasure. The presentation is unique, the ingredients are artfully arranged and the attention to detail shows.

The food itself is delicious. The meats are tender and juicy with that nice textural variety with the tender interior and the roasted, crisp edges of the exterior. The flavour of the greens are well complimented by the briny sourness of the pickles. On the other side of the profile, the pita and creamy hummous offer a nice contrast. 

If you are lucky enough to be a resident of this wonderful neighbourhood, I envy you. Tazza is definitely a highlight of the Bridgeland experience."}
{"text":"As we are new to Calgary I check up on reviews on yelp to different places and when we have a chance we go to those places.  This place is clean and has a lovely outside patio.  The people were not that friendly, there was a quite rude lady at the front.  I know Lebanese food.  This was Good but not great.   We tried quite a bit of food.  The best was the Tabouleh, Hummus and Taziki.  The falafel was cold, hard and not that flavourful.  The meat was OK.  The pita was store bought not made.  The fatayr did not have enough filling.  The Baklava was good.  We lived in Toronto for 7 years and sourced out the best eateries within 6 months of living there.  We enjoy all types of cuisines.  But Calgary seriously falls short on great food, good portion sizes for reasonable prices.  Tazza is pricey and the portion sizes are ok at best.  I seriously find the mall food courts have better food than some of these restaurants.  Try Tazza and then go to cross iron mills and try the food at villa medina the chicken shish Taouk is far better and the portion sizes easily 2 people can eat for about 12 dollars.  We love Calgary, this place deserves way better restaurants!!!"}
{"text":"tasty fresh food with friendly service.

i liked the sliced hot peppers on the side.

they need to change their plates. when you use your utensil it is like scraping metal on a chalkboard!"}
{"text":"Very authentic, nice owners. Convenient location in Bridgeland with a small parking lot.
This is my hubby's favorite place to get the grape leaves filled with rice. I am no connoisseur of Lebanese food but I really like the beef filled pastries (fatayar?)
Small seating area, very artisan-type crowd. Not cheap but you get what you pay for in this case, homemade. The food does not look nor taste as though it has ever been frozen.
We never leave without a bag of goodies for take-out."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh Mediterranean cuisine! I had a chicken wrap (can't remember the full name) and it was so we'll balanced with lots of freshness to it! Service was great too! The owner served me and she was super friendly and tried to get to know me. Love places like that. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"I live in Vancouver - but anytime I am in Calgary I make a point of going here at least once.  Best Lebanese food EVER!  Great family that runs the place - love love love it:)"}
{"text":"Ive written a review already, but it was removed.  Seems these people have some kind of contact or support in the yelp administration.  I'll try to put it delicatly and see if this review makes the cut, if it is removed again then i do believe yelp/javier will be criminally liable

 I had the shwarma it tasted like cat food, and looked like it, I believe they have a cat at the restaurant and I did see owner/manager  feeding it.  In the hour I waited for my shwarma to finally come it was horrible, had hairs in it and dirt.  I watched him sweeping up the place while he was making my shwarma, kept saying that the meat needed to warm up, as the spindle was off, I went outside for a smoke, and when i came back in it was all ready made, and I headed home to eat it and discover it was catfood&floor sweepings, I feel horribly sick, vomiting diahrea constantly, Im in the hospital emergency room waiting --- stay away form this place."}
{"text":"Sooo yummy. Probably one of top 2 shawarma places in the city in my opinion(and I've been to at least 7 probably). They roll and wrap the food super neatly so it's easy to eat and looks tidy in the pita. (Sometimes shawarmas, I find, look like they are slapped together which makes me sick to my stomach looking at them while I eat. But not here.) The staff is super friendly and ingredients are delicious. Usually I get the chicken or falafel shish-taouk and sometimes the baklava. All of those have been really good."}
{"text":"I have to say thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews about Tazza as they were spot on. My friend and I ate lunch there and we experienced some great service, great food, and just enjoyed some Lebanese hospitality.  It felt almost like we were eating at their home and they wanted my us to enjoy and sample their great food, which we did. I had some falafel that came right out of the pan---Wow is the only thing I can say about them."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter you will realize this is a family owned and operated business. I ordered the shawarma sandwich with all the topings and also baba ghanoush and felafel for starter. 

Baba ghanoush was fantastic, very tasty and garlicy :D However, felafel was precooked and then microwaved which made it saggy. The shawarma sandwich was okay, for sure not the best shawarma Ihave tried. 

If you are in bridgeland and are looking for a quick sandwich, I highly recommend this place but do not expect anything out of ordinary. 

I think I will only go back there to buy some take out baba ghanoush, otherwise other items on the menu did not look promising."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch...chicken and a grape Pop Shoppe...mmmm. While getting out of the car I noticed the owner coming out of his under renovation store across the street and he invited us in. The concept is a throw back to the community store with an ice cream counter, fresh meats, salads and grab and go meals.

When this opens (by mid November 2011) it will be worth checking out the food but the interior is spectacular with a touch of new with the old style of the building."}
{"text":"This is a neighbourhood favourite. If you meet anybody who has lived in Bridgeland, they have been to Tazza AT LEAST once, and more than likely tens of millions of times. They don't use recipes here, so the food changes a bit from time to time, but it is always fresh and good.

I'm partial to their Hummus and Baba Ganoush - mouth wateringly delicious fare. You can buy fresh pita in store. They have all the standard Mediterranean cuisine available, and it is all delicious. But what makes Tazza stand out is the family that runs it in the small, homey building where it takes its residence. It's got character - it could totally be in a Calgary Seinfeld. Make the trip as the food, the experience and the owners will make it one of your favourite Calgary destinations, like it is mine."}
{"text":"tazza, tazZA, tAZZA, TAZZA!

Back in the day, Tazza wraps were my favourite office lunch. Yet, I had no idea where the location even was. All I knew was that when the receptionist was looking for lunch suggestions and I was the first one within earshot, she'd get a loud: \"TAZZA!!!\"

Then one day, I discovered I could actually get my own Tazza wrap. I didn't have to wait for said receptionist to get the go ahead to order lunch for the office. SCORE! Now I happily munch on my fave (Hint for my friends: If you're ever looking for a lunch item to bribe me with... it's the chicken shish taouk wrap).

So yummy. So good. Damn, now I wish they were open late!"}
{"text":"Worst Mediterranean fare we've experienced in a very long time!  Tabouli, tasteless; hummus, flavorless; lamb shawarma, dry and tough; veggie platter, disappointing. They were busy, so folks must like it, but if you're looking for good Mediterranean, this isn't it"}
{"text":"The falafel wrap is amazing!!! Best I ever had!!! Tastes sooooo good!! Seriously amazing and so fresh!!"}
{"text":"I have travelled the world and never had a better baklava! Family owned and operated - the love on this block with the grocery store across the street speaks volumes for this community! Their shawarma is second to none- but that goes without saying!"}
{"text":"After my first visit over the summer, Tazza quickly stole my heart and has become one of my favourite places for a quick lunch stop with friends. 

With so many vegetarian options available at Tazza, I didn't know what I wanted to try first. On my initial visit, I settled with the hummus and tabouleh wrap, which is now totally my favourite thing. Their tabouleh salad is bomb, just in case you were wondering. I also really enjoy the falafel, with most every crisp vegetables and some tahina. Pair this with an iced Guayaki yerba mate (my favourite is REVEL BERRY, featuring a bad ass revolutionary on the tall can), and I'm swooning. 

Tazza is always quite busy when I visit here, and I only wish it were open longer hours so I could swing by for dinner once in awhile. If the weather's nice, I love to eat on the lovely patio, or head across to Bridgeland Market for some Santa Cruz lemonade and call it a picnic outside with my friends."}
{"text":"You come for the food! I have had several items on the menu and it is all Fresh , authentic and wow. Bring a friend or get it to go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think most of good reviews are old. I tried this twice in April 2013 and August 2013 both times with the family so almost tried everything. The chicken shawarma is very bad, DO NOT try it. The shish tawwok platter is fine, but not the best. Falafel was very cold and thick so the inside veg's are not well done. Tabboleh was just acceptable, in fact very bad if you compare it to Little lebanon. The lahem baajeen (meat wrap) was also very bad."}
{"text":"Let's just say that I came to this restaurant with high expectations as the reviews I read were positive. I ordered two chicken sheish salads with two plain pitas to go and took lunch to my sister. My sister has had this salad numerous times before and loved it. Upon initial taste we found the flavours to be quite good, however, taking another glance at the salad it appeared that the chicken was quite flabby and fatty making it inedible to eat. Actually it made me want to vomit thinking about the grissly fat in my mouth. The salad was also lacking in typical ingredients like pickled turnip which normally came in the salad. The pita was also old and stale. 

With much debate we decided to pack up our salads and take them back to the store to see what they were willing to do for us. An older woman, who I presume to be one of the owners, asked me what was wrong. I explained my concerns to which her response was not an apology but reasons for why certain ingredients weren't on the salad (even though I had ordered them \"loaded\"). She proceeded to the cash register, presented me the money for the salads and then proceeded to wave me out the door. I am disappointed that Tazza didn't take the opportunity to correct their mistake and salvage a customer or even offer me an alternative. Suffice to say I will not be returning and neither should you."}
