{"text":"Well I finally tried this place with a friend of mine. I was kinda interested to see how this would go since I saw that it had opened. They let you choose your own soup base, the type of noodle and the \"toppings\" you want. Well I didn't really know what to pick. I didn't any explanations as to what kind the soup bases were; I had to google them on my phone. And for me, the soup base is the most important part so I know what sort of toppings I wanted. So, I sort of just winged it. While my friend went with one of their soups from the menu.

Well, his soup was served first and upon looking at it, it looked like it was lacking, just things in general and was getting worried about mine, which came out a few moments afterwards. Looking at mine and looking at his, I found mine to be very full - full of noodles, veggies and toppings while his, well as stated, was lacking. Well, I can't say I loved my soup. I found it missing something, maybe if I knew more about their soups bases, I might have been better equipped to make choices. The soup didn't suck, but it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be. 

I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon, but I'd probably try it again to see if it gets better."}
{"text":"If you love soup dishes and want a great deal on ramen, this is the place for you. Food is always good, the staff is always friendly, and plenty of choices. Plus they are right across from the building they are moving coffee, tea, and snow into, which is a great place to grab a cool treat. So all in all 1 star for location, 2 stars for food, 1 star for service, and a final star for choices and price."}
{"text":"Waiters here are too impolite and rude? and always makes miatakes. And it took so long to get my dishes."}
{"text":"I love the location and always order food from other places in this marketplace, however, the service was pretty horrible. Our server was generally polite but never refilled our waters and the food took pretty long to come out, even though there was only two other people waiting for their food. I ordered dumpling noodle soup and what I received was a tasteless mound of noodles and overly cooked dumplings. After adding half a bottle of Siracha, I gave up on this place. Take your money to Taiwan express! It's right next to this place and Is cheaper, has better food, and better service."}
{"text":"Very disgusted - Shrimp smelled rotten in the wontons.  I had to spit out all of it.  Used Taiwanese Bok Choy instead of Hong Kong Choi Sum.  I would have asked for money back but I bought the wonton noodle soup as a takeout while passing through town."}
{"text":"Food is ok, a little too much msg in my opinion So I haven't have the urge to come back.  The service is also really slow...."}
{"text":"Think I'm done here. 

I've been here a handful of times now thinking things would improve (not sure why), but they didn't. As others have mentioned, the main thing is the service. They are beyond slow to take your order and, depending on what you get, are incredibly slow at making it. The clay pot dishes are decent, but they take over 20 minutes for them to make. Most of the noodle dishes are unfortunately pretty bland. Like, zero flavor. I shouldn't need to pour layers of sriracha sauce in my soup to make it taste flavorful. 

And worst of all, tipping is required, but they don't actually provide any service! They point you to an open seat when you walk in, bring you your food when it's done, then give you the bill when you're finished eating (unless you're solo, then you pay up front). That's the absolute minimum and does not warrant a 15% tip on top of the bill. Every time I've had to flag down one of the waiters to refill my clearly empty glass of water. Instead of trying to rip everyone off, they should place a tipping jar next to the register like other Chinese restaurants that don't actually provide table service.

There are much better choices in the area for sure. I'd try it maybe for the clay dishes, but be prepared to be disappointed with everything else."}
{"text":"Good try noodle shop but not quite there to be anything outstanding. Not bad though.

Really liked the appetizers: Fried buns with condensed milk and the wings.

As for noodle- in my party, we tried different combos of noodles. Everyone thought their dish was alright. Personally, I got the Thai tom yum soup, thick egg noodle, wontons, and beef tendon balls. Soup was
alright. Egg noodle was mediocre. Wontons were actually the only good thing in my bowl! Beef tendon balls were basic. Milk tea was basically water.

Service was lacking. Not attentive. Took like 10 minutes after we sat down to get water..

Just get the wontons. Get the appetizers. Skip the noodles. I heard the clay pot rice bowl is good too though."}
{"text":"Been here several times, with some things quite good,  and others more like an aquired taste.   Menu is small,  mainly soups and a few baked rice bowls.  There's a pick it youself soup menu, with different soup base types, noodle and topping choices.  If you are not used to asian fish broths,  they can be a little too fishy for the average (non-asian) person.   They do have a Hong Kong style wonton soup that I think is quite excellent.   Big bowl of wontons, with a good amount baby bok choy.  A meal in itself.  Won tons are both meaty (pork and shrimp)  and flavorful, and in a nice chicken stock based broth.  I think the best won ton in Phoenix area that I've found so far.  Also tried some of the rice bowls,  and thought they were good too.  One was with mini spare ribs in a black bean sauce, and another had chicken and black mushrooms.  Both also had bok choy.  Included with the rich bowls, is a small bowl of fish broth that you're supposed to use after you eat the meat ect, and use at the end for the rice that is stuck to the sides of the bowl.  Kinda like a rice soup at the end.  Again,  it has a very strong fish flavor,  so may not appeal to non-asian  pallate.  But after a few spoonfuls, it seems less fishy and quite good. 

Definatley great place to get my won ton fix."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese restaurants that serve comfort food- noodle soup.  Not everyone likes this type of food.  It is Cantonese and the soup is fish based.  For one price, you get to choose one of the flavored soups, type of noodle and toppings.  My favorite is the century egg with parsley soup paired with thick, flat rice noodle with fish ball and fish Tou fu.  Hubby likes their won ton egg noodle soup.  Once in a while, I will order their spicy soups for a change of taste."}
{"text":"The food are good but the service was bad .Some of the waitress always been on the phone or not even take care of the table .This is the first restaurant have a worst service in AZ."}
{"text":"It's basic human decency to wash hands after using the restroom... don't think I can give this place anymore business after seeing a kitchen worker marched right out of the toilet without washing her hands... so gross!!"}
{"text":"This is my eight year old's favorite restaurant in the whole world because she loves their noodles (the spaghetti noodles, with chicken broth and meatballs).

I like it very well too.  It is clean and relatively quick.  The location is great, in an Asian mall with a dry foods store, bakery, shaved ice store, and more.

The chicken broth based soups are excellent.  Some of the other broths are too intense for me.  The dumplings they use are wonderfully flavorful, but no surprise, all the ingredients I've had have been good.

The dandan noodles had a good flavor but were much too \"all one flavor\".

The deep fried chicken wings were delicious.  The meat was tender and the battered skin was very crisp."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 3 times, and I've enjoyed every time here.

First of all, the ordering process consist of filling out a form and handing to the server. Due to the plethora of soups and toppings you can choose from, it's actually reasonable, but I found it weird my first time.

FOOD: The portion sizes here are huge, so I would just order a entree (noodle soup) with an appetizer for two people. My favorite soup is the papaya soup, and I just change up the type of noodle and toppings every time I go. The soup's flavors are very subtle and savory. 

Overall, a really good Asian noodle soup place. Even though there are other pho places in the same plaza, I prefer Deer Garden every visit."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Delicious food, would recommend! Choose your base, your noodle, and some extras! Large portions, and wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is amazing but the execution is just bad. I can see potential but from what I've experienced, I wouldn't recommend this place.

The idea of building your own bowl of soup from the broth to the noodles, to picking your own toppings is awesome in theory until you \"did not pick it right\" is what my friend told me. 

One thing I can't stand in life is black pepper and when my soup came out tasting like black pepper and old cabbage, I just can't... it literally had no other flavor. I'm sorry but if one of the soup base is no good, no matter what combination I pick, I will lose. 

Definitely don't recommend this place unless you know how to \"pick the right flavors\" and deal with not having service. 

Oh and they also add their own tip, probably to ensure they received tips because they don't offer good service."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were here 10 minutes ago to have the dinner, total is $19.72 including tax, I paid with card and signed for $20, and prepare to leave another $2 cash as tip, because I think it's better for the waiter/waitress to be tipped with cash. However the gentleman (probably the owner, he's the one always there, and was a friend of my friend) came to us and said if we paid the wrong amount. It was confused for us because we paid for more than the actual amount, then I realized it was how he asked for the tip, it was uncomfortable and it was our right to leave any amount of tip depending on their service quality.

I've been this place for the past few years with my friends since I was here for the college, they always have terrible service as the others have commented below, the problem is that they are the only place offering such kind of taste in this area, even though it's expensive compare for what they offered, there are still a lot of Chinese students would like to come, but the problem is for their terrible service, how could they ask for any tip? It's shame on them, and I will spread this experience among all of my friends and hope they can learn for this."}
{"text":"They give you huge portions! :) my daughter who is 1 year old loves the soup and rice! I love getting the clay pot even tho it takes 20 mins, they let you know ahead of time! You also have options to create your own soup! This restaurant deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Soup for the soul for the winter is a must. Decided to choose the $9.50 option in which you select the soup base, then noodle, then 2 toppings or more for an additional $1.25 and then a drink. 

Today I chose the pickled cabbage fish soup (which is a bit more on the pungent side and vinegary) with thick rice noodles, with Hong Kong style dumplings (yellow thin skin with mushroom and meat fillings) and hot milk tea (which you'll have to add some sugar for some taste).  There is a wide selection of each options so have fun mixing and matching to your liking! 

If you're not too adventurous, they have a few staple selections such as the Hong Kong dumpling noodle soup for $7.50 or the spicy Dan Dan noodles with minced pork with a cup of fish soup for $5.75! Give it a go!

There are a couple TVs to watch sports or the Chinese channel. Seating can be one or up to 8-10. I've got the rest of the year to try out many of the others that I haven't tried yet. Who's game to create different soups?"}
{"text":"Fantastic Broth!!!! We ordered one customized ramen set (chicken broth, brisket, dumplings, and hot milk tea) and pork&vegetable dumpling ramen. We enjoyed the dumplings in the soup so much! This was our 2nd visit and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a gold find for me. I crave soup noodles often, and pho and ramen just tastes off (I grew up in China). They're very delicious and I will eat them, but they don't hit the spot like Deer Garden's soup does.

I am in love with this place especially with this cold weather coming (yes I'm a total wuss, I freeze in the office). You can pick from 10 to 15 delicious fish and non-fish based broth, a wide selection of add-ins, a type of noodles, and you get a drink with it. I always get the hot milk tea even in summer, it's really good except when they add too much half n half to the tea. I always take the plastic spoon out cause I swear it gives the drink a plasticky taste. The bad thing is sometimes services takes a long time, especially if you go during normal dinner hours. I've had to wait up to 30 min before.

For appetizers or dessert, the golden fried buns with condensed milk reminds me so much of China. Just be aware it's terribly greasy.

I haven't tried all the soup bases yet. They all taste unique so you really just gotta try it to see if you like it. My favorite so far is the Sichuan and the Malay, paired with wide rice noodles. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular their for the past 2 years, even though they have horrible service their food was always worth it. But the other day they crossed the line and we will never go back. The waitress was super rude when we asked for an extra bowl to share. Even went as far to make a face at me behind my back which my girlfriend saw. On top of that they never came back to refill waters or provide any service. Then when we went to pay, after swiping our card, the lady tells us that gratuity was added. 
I honestly was going to let the horrible service of that day go and come back again because to be honest I've grown used to their horrible service but they crossed the line when they added grat and didn't tell us until after swiping our card. 
Mind you, we were just a party of two and the auto grat only came out to $2 and some change but I find that extremely shady. Also keep in mind that we always tipped above 20% when we ate there. 
Kind of breaks my heart because I loved their malay laksa soup but a restaurant that does not value their customers does not deserve my business."}
{"text":"Food: huge portion! I like how they let you customize your soup with different broths, noodles and toppings. Although the menu is confusing, especially for those who can't read Mandarin/Cantonese (I'm not sure which one exactly), just go for whatever sounds good to you; since everything I've tried so far is pretty tasty. I've had the original fish broth, malay laksa, tomyum, instant noodles, korean clear noodles, fish fillets, HK style wontons, shrimp, bokchoy, fried pork, fried buns, etc. I'm looking forward to come back and try more combinations of soup to find my favorite of all. 

Service: this is the reason why I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5. Service is so-so. Servers don't seem to care much about you after they dropped off your food. Every time I ask for iced water, I always have to repeat myself multiple times with different servers. It makes me feel like they don't want to spare a glass of ice water for me since they charge $1 extra for cold drinks. Additionally, unless I ask for it, I never got my water refilled. 

Location: they are right at the entrance to the food court of Mekong Plaza. I never have to wait for a table though they always have decent amount of people dining. You just walk right in and sit wherever. 

Overall, pretty good place to come for just a huge tasty bowl of noodle soup. Will come back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here."}
{"text":"I go to Mekong plaza allot but was very hesitant on trying this place! Finally I was introduced by a few friends and the food is actually good! The soup was very savory and the portion is huge!! They have allot of noodles and they have a build you own menu too! It was my first time there so I let my friend order for me and then I added on extra sides onto my bowl for 1$ extra. My bowl was still cheap! They don't have a large variety for drinks though. The cup is so tiny and I feel like they are very stingy with their drinks. I asked for more water and it was never done. The service was ok. Not the best service.... I had to keep repeating myself... Kinda annoyed by that. After they drop off your food you're basically on your own. I would come back again and try something else, but I have a feeling this place will tick you off if you're really high with service, cause it's not that great here."}
{"text":"Their service today is horrible! My husband and I ordered at the same time and his soup came out a whole 7-10 minutes before mine!  We were never offered any refills until the moment my husband signed the check.  ALSO, Deer Garden automatically puts 15% for gratuity on the check!  They are NOT WORTH 15% TIP!!!!!??!"}
{"text":"Great price for a bowl of hot noodle soup with tea or coffee!
Also interesting menu - you build your noodle soups by picking your meat/soup/noodles.

I have been eating here weekly for 2 months now and their food have improved over time. I had my doubt at the very beginning when the milk tea tasted like lipton tea with creamer. Now it is much better!

The only complaint I have is the place needs more A/C for serving hot noodle soup in AZ summer."}
{"text":"The portion of a bowl of soup is pretty large. They hand out the paper menu so you can mark what choices you want to put in to fit with your appetite. Along with that, there are plenty of noodles and cabbage included. I love the Szechuan soup with a little touch of fish fillet and shitaki mushroom. Drinks are included with the lunch package, but they add extra for cold drinks. 

Service is a so-so, sometimes I get a really friendly server, sometimes I get a frowny one. I can come here once at a time but not on a regular basis, because its not much different from the ramen I can cook at home."}
{"text":"this is one the favorite restaurant in arizona.  if you like hot noodle soup, this is the place.  you get to choose from a variety of soup base, then you get to pick 2 main ingredients ($1 for the 3rd ingredient and so forth) and there are 6-8 different kinda noodles you get to choose from!  my daughter loves its chiu chow soup base and me is fish soup base.  expect a big bowl of noodles filled w/mushrooms, tofu skin, naper, and cilantro.  yum and healthy!  no msg and not salty soup base.  average cost for our family of 3 is about $25-30.  :)

update (june 18, 2014): dg is still one of our favorite restaurant.  we always bring our out-of-town guests here and they are impressed w/the soup noodles (most of our guests come from chicago).  just beware of the the slow service when most patrons come at the same time...because they have a small kitchen (a waiter shared this information to us).  the last table has to wait a long time before your orders are prepared.

highly recommend...
1. the szechuan spicy soup base if you enjoy spicy food
2. hk style wonton is one of the best we have ever had
3. 5 spices wings (my kid's favorite)
4. try the clay pot rice!  our favorite is squid, minced pork, and preserved vegetable

conclusion: we love this place so much that we don't mind the once-in-a-while wait or \"bad\" service."}
{"text":"So think of which which or chipotle, a place where you design your own plate. Now enter here and you design your own Asian soup. You start with choosing a base, so tom yum, Achaean spicy, basic chicken broth etc. then pick your type
Of noodle, whether it is udon or thin rice noodles, then you pick your 2 topping whether it's mushrooms, pork blood, brisket, wonton dumplings- GET THE WON TON DUMPLINGS!! And it's all for $8.50 for a huge bowl. We got
A side of Bok Choy for an extra $1.50, but for price, this place kills it."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I craved this weekly and would have given 5 stars but like many places, the quality and quantity start to decrease as time goes by.  Luckily it is not a huge difference.  The soup is a tad diluted from before and they seem to give less of the choose your own toppings.  I only got two Hong Kong style wontons vs 3-4 before.  My mom only got a few pieces of fish vs \"a lot\" before.  

Nevertheless, it is still quite enjoyable and a giant bowl plentiful of noodles and default veggies (Napa, mushrooms, tofu skin (yes!!).  The fish soup broth options are all good to me from spicy Tom yum to mild Malay laksa (the best!) to the tomato pumpkin broth (love!).  Always love the build-your-own noodle soup bowl concept with lots of meat and veggie toppings to choose from.  I usually choose the dumplings, wonton, bok choy, or fish.  The many noodle options are exciting as well. I have a hard time choosing between ho fun and Korean sweet potato noodles. 

It does come with tea or milk tea but I opt out as they taste like dirt water.  Service is not great so I don't come here expecting it.  The food is worth the chaos and sometimes slow service. 

Overall, I still like to come here occasionally."}
{"text":"TLDR: Decent food, Horrible service, Questionable sanitation, Unreasonably long wait times.

I'll start by saying that I have a huge soft spot for noodles, and theirs are actually not bad. There are a lot of combos you could potentially get so most people could probably find something they really like with a few tries. 

But, even if their food were absolutely amazing, (which it isn't) it does not make up for the litany of other horrible things about this place. I think noodles are answer to all of life's problems, so I've endured a lot of their shit (literally, I'll get to that later), but after a certain point I just couldn't do it anymore. Below is a list of some of their most egregious F-ups.

1. Long wait: I've been to a lot of noodle places with a similar ordering/serving styles (mostly in China) so I know how it's done. They usually have the broth ready in the back and when the order comes in they just throw everything into a metal ladle with a net and cook it up (think of it like Chipotle for noodles). This process usually shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, yet somehow, they always just barely manage to do it in 15, even when there aren't any other tables waiting. 
(I know my complaint might be little nitpicky, but this, coupled with the employees' don't-give-a-shit attitude, has always really annoyed me.)

2. I have once waited for over 2 hours for my food. Granted, it was really busy when we first got in there, but after about an hour it died down a lot. We asked them about our order and it turned out they just forgot about it, even though we were sitting RIGHT in front of the counter. After they found our order (it was literally right next to the order pile) we thought we'd be able to get our food pretty soon. BUT NOPE, we got to wait another hour for them to get it out to us.

3.  My family went there without me once (because maybe we're all masochists, and we all like being treated badly). My mom told me afterwards, that when they brought the food out, there was the distinctive smell of human excrement. She wasn't sure if she was just imagining it, and she didn't want to ruin the rest the party's meal, so she asked for some vinegar to try and overpower the poop smell. When she received it, she noticed that it had gone bad. At that point she rage quit and gave up eating there ever again. 

This doesn't even cover the CONSISTENTLY shitty service that many other yelpers have mentioned in their review. I feel that people usually will overlook the horrible service because the food isn't bad and it's cheap. But after the poop noodle incident, I've finally decided that that nothing is worth the degradation that is eating there.

I try not to be pushy about my opinion on restaurants, because everyone has different tastes. But there are so many great restaurants out there run by people who actually appreciate their customers. Don't waste your time or money on this piece-of-shit establishment that couldn't care less about you as long as you give them your money. Save your money and give it to someone more deserving."}
{"text":"Not having good time here , waiting for long time after order.  Tip are add on to the bill, even you feel they don't deserve the tip. 
Food are ok, but just bad serve"}
{"text":"It was a interesting experience. 

Pro was the portions is huge! Like Massive bowls with lots of toppings and it was very delicious! I enjoyed the food and I was very full after. My friends enjoyed our food too. 

The con was our water was never refilled after we were given it as well our waitress never came back except to give us our checks after we were given our food which luckily she spilt them into four which I usually have to say when I go out with friends but not much more than that. 

In the end! Food is bomb -- Service is so so."}
{"text":"They need to update their hours on yelp because it says open at 9 am on here. I went in at 10:40 am and they told me that kitchen doesn't open till 11 am. I also tried calling several times before coming in and no answer even though there were workers there. 

Been here many times. Needs to hire servers who knows how to speak English. The servers are not attentive at all. You literally have to wave them down if you need something because they are so busy talking to each other. And when you have questions about the menu, they don't know what to say because they barely speak English. 

Food is decent."}
{"text":"My friends and I have never been here and decided to try it after Hue Bun Bo was closed for the day.. And boy did I wish we didn't..so many regrets. The portion is huge, but the flavor is not there and on top of that the service was horrible. I like the idea that we got to customize our soup but everything is bland. The won tons is not tasty it's comparable to frozen won tons you can get at Mekong so nothing special there. The noodles barely  have flavor and was kinda all stuck together.. The Szechuan soup has a strong pepper/cabbage flavor that is sort of watered down. 

We also ordered ginger chicken wings and although the flavors was ok there was only 2 wings for $2! So not so good in my book. 

My friend got the chicken/mushrooms rice stone bowl and it was the better tasting dish hence the two stars or else it would be one star. 

Anyways, from my review you already know that I would not be coming back. Should have listened to my friend who have been there before and said the food is horrible."}
{"text":"I like their food, the thick rice noodle in the soup just like the ones that i had in China. However, the waiting time for food is a bit long, and the stuff don't seem welcome you that much."}
{"text":"It started out with a 3 stars for the service alone, until I saw the portions of the food of the patrons whom have previously posted a review. For 2 people, We paid a total $32.00 including a tip and  I chose the almond papay fish soup. The cups were damn near 6 oz double shooters and they even added ice as a filler. The smoke from the guys outside sure didn't help with the ambiance.  The bowl sang with the vibrant green of bok choy leaves, the volume of fresh pumpkins, and the promising smells of the sea. The only problem was the main problem.....it was flavor difficient. I had no choice but to pour soy sauce and sirracha just because it was sooooo flavorless and that changed the dynamic of it. I'm sure that there are other items on the menu that worthy of accolades but after what i experienced, I'll consider that time well spent with a brother versus money well spent."}
{"text":"This review isn't about Deer Garden's food nor their service, but it is about their audacity to enter a tip amount EQUAL to the grand total.

My mom took us here to eat, since there is a great selection of soup noodle. The bill totaled around $40 for the four of us, and after tax and tip it hovered around $50. She signs the receipt and we leave, thinking nothing more of this place.

A week later, my mom gets a call from the credit card company asking about a $100 charge at Deer Garden, because the tip was $50. I'm glad the credit card company asked whether the establishment was worth a 50% tip, because it wasn't.

Unfortunately this credit card company doesn't do the arguing for you, so my mom had to go back to this place. Luckily they yielded pretty quickly, since my mom produced her copy of the receipt. Even they know that a $50 tip on a $40 meal is outrageous.

Moral: 1.) Keep your receipts. 2.) Have a good credit card that looks after your back. And 3.) DON'T eat at places that, whether intentionally or unintentionally, bill you incorrectly."}
{"text":"Wait staff is efficient, yet attentive. 

In selecting your ramen, you choose the type of noodle, broth, & toppings. 

I recalled not been impressed during my previous visit. But I could not remember what I ordered. 

Today's visit, however, was different. The Tom Yum broth was flavorful. The toppings complemented each other well. The bowl of ramen was big. There was enough food for 2 adults. 

The \"desert wings\" were deep fried chicken wings. The skin was crispy. But to me the flavor was light. But my wife found them tasty. 

We will be back to try other broths and dishes."}
{"text":"The soup base was good. The noodles were good. Overall, the meal was good. I really like how you can customize your bowl of noodle soup. I got the Korean noodles and spam and brisket toppings with Malay soup base. It was delicious.

Price is comparable to pho or other ramen shops so it's not like you are doing something more expensive than usual. This place can add variety to your diet or restaurant choices!

I like that there were TVs and I was able to watch the games. Although the service was a little lacking. There weren't any servers. More like there were a bunch of college kids hanging out and they happened to be also bringing food and water to you and pretending to be servers.

Oh yeah, they should also mark on their menu what is spicy and what is not. Too bad they don't so beware!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the buzz about this place. I ordered their DanDan noodles and the server warned me that it was going to be super spicy (it was a 5 out of 10 for me when I tasted it). My friends customized their soups and agreed that both of theirs were on the bland side. I might be back to try their claypot dishes but it says on the menu that it takes 25 minutes to make. I enjoyed their milk tea though and Crispy Buns with condensed milk. But yeah, meh."}
{"text":"Holy crap! I don't know where to even begin with this place! Staff, let's start with staff, they all look like a bunch of college students who don't really speak english or really care about their customers unless it's their own friends that come in. Luckily I speak Cantonese so I could flag down atleast one of the people that worked there! They aren't very attentive nor do they really care about their customers, it was almost like we were bothering them to do their job. One of the girls spilled the hot milk tea on my boyfriend and our table, didn't apologize, took a good 3 minutes to grab 3 napkins, and just LAYED the napkins over the spill, then walked off. What on earth?! Is that what you do at home?! Speaking of milk tea, it was SUPER watered down and had absolutely no flavor to it. 
Now onto the food, half of our party got there 20 minutes before the rest so we ordered the claypot rice ahead of time, then ordered 4 different bowls of noodles, one which had their original fish broth, which no longer tasted like what it used to be.. when the rest of our party came they ordered their noodle bowls and somehow theirs came out before the first groups did.. then we got 2 random wings sent to our table, well that made absolutely no sense, no one ordered it and if it was on the house, why would you give us two when there's 8 plus people there?!? Do we all each take one bite and pass it down?! 

We were short utensils and napkins as well, couldn't flag anyone down to get more so we had to go up to the counter and ask, that spilled milk tea wasn't replaced, although I wouldn't have drank or wanted another one anyways, so in conclusion I don't really care for this place unless I were to get it to go. I only gave this place a 2 star because my spouse loved his noodles that he created lol.

I've had better service at a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the decent foods. 
I ordered a noodle soup and a clay pot, after i finished my noodle i found out they have forgotten to order my clay pot.
So i waited for another 25 mins....

In the end waitress packed my rice for me but i wanted to eat the rice IN the pot, thats the most important thing right?! Oh well i guess she was just being nice.."}
{"text":"Really great. Big portions and oh man, so good. First time having fish soup, and I'm hooked. The beef was fall-apart delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered build your own noodle bowl and I was so not impressed. Husband got a won ton noodle and was also not impressed. Servers were not attentive, had to hand delivered them our order. Their milk tea was cheap but also not good. So overall, not a good place to eat at and definitely won't come in again."}
{"text":"This chinese restaurant is a garbage. Food sucks, and dirty, MSG for sure. My stomach always seem to upset when I eat here. Worst service ever, slow response, don't care at people sitting around, then go home, watch ur TV show ^^ Stop talking Chiness, do ur work, I don't care how close you are to the BOSS, i pay to eat."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in the area, my wife and I decided to try this place out after seeing the menu on the wall. 

Our fish soup that was given to us was delicious. You could really taste the fish and thank you for not just making a soup with just a powder base. 

Secondly we ordered the Preserved Meat Clay Pot (extra crispy make sure to request for that). It was delicious, obviously not the healthiest thing, but tasty nonetheless. It does take awhile to make and they warn you (25 minutes), but it's worth the wait. The rice comes out nice and crispy and the preserved meat give the rice and veggies a wonderful taste.

Overall, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I only stumbled upon this restaurant by chance, and had a decently pleasant visit. I walked in a little unprepared, not even knowing what type of food they served. Luckily the girl that greeted me was very helpful and accommodating. I ordered the Thai -something- spicy soup with beef and mushrooms with hot tea. The building had some nice contemporary lighting, although it was on the smaller side, being part of a strip. I imagine it would get a little cozy during busy hours. There was a slight smell of fish that you adjust to after being inside for a small amount of time. I didn't have time to look around much, as my food was ready to go within five minutes. The to go set up was very well done and secure, no need to worry about spilling anything. The tea was the first thing I tried. It tastes delicate, almost floral. I was expecting it to be bitter because of the color, but it proved to be lightly sweet and smooth. The soup I opened upon arriving home and immediately burned my finger. Beware, they serve it incredibly hot. When I was finally able to dig in the soup had a nice amount of spicy heat but lacking in the beef and mushrooms. After eating my fill, I still had most of my soup left over, so the proportions are big. I would give this place a 3.5 star rating if half stars were possible."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Horrible service and horrible food. My husband asked for fish sauce to add taste to his bland soup and the rude waitress stated they didn't have any. Had to add so much salt to my soup and it was still tasteless."}
{"text":"Ordered the original fish soup with flat rice noodles, exactly 4 pieces of hk dumplings, 4 pieces of pork blood, and a handful of beef tendons - also a small side order of pork chop to split with a friend. The broth was nice and light and the noodles were plentiful, making for a meal that was neither too light or too heavy. Tendons were the proper soft, chewy texture. Dumplings and pork chop were pretty basic but I still enjoyed them. Overall a satisfying dinner on a cold night."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite Chinese restaurant in AZ. I always visit this place when I go to Phoenix. 
Their food is very authentic and price is pretty reasonable. This place is always busy, so you might need to wait for a while. I especially love almond papaya soup and pork rib rice in hot stone."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty.
We love the wonton noodle soup and the clay pots.
Some great appetizers also.
This place is different than other Chinese restaurant. Noodles and clay pot only.
Not a big menu..
We love eating here"}
{"text":"Just be careful!  they already charge tips on your bill without informing you.  Make sure you look at your receipt.  I would have given them the same amount, but they should not have charged without my consent. 

Otherwise, the food is really good, it's worth checking out.  just make sure you double check your bill."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pumpkin flavored soup. There are a variety of soups that you can get. Unfortunately, it takes about 20 to 25 minutes to get your order. The service can be much better."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the service was really, really slow. After ordering, my guest and I waited about 30 minutes. We were warned it would be a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"It is my fist time to eat there. I have soup noodle, the food is ok.  But an hours after eating there, I got a call from my credit card company and they told me there suspicious transactions in my account. There are 3 transactions in total, all of them are made within an hour.  One of the them is a purchase from Microsoft for $1900.  The amount is outrageous. I suspect my credit card info is stolen there.  Maybe the credit card reader is hacked, or maybe an employee did it. I wouldn't trust them with my credit card.  I...f I have to go back, I will definitely pay with cash."}
{"text":"I had their Hong Kong style wonton soup and I was quite impressed. The dumbo king contained tasty pork, an exotic tasting mushroom and some spice that, when in combination, gave a palatable and unaggressive flavor.

The soup base was chicken, I believe, and not salty as is the wont of most Chinese establishments. 

The bok choy was a pleasant addition and gave it a good texture and taste.

I heartily recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Food is good if you chose correctly but service is the worst imaginable. I have a tolerance for poor service when it comes to Chinese food but this service is pretty unacceptable. The ladies had an attitude and often made faces at customers. They were even passive aggressive when it came to paying for the bill. They sort of just speak chinese behind your back and I understood. Water was rarely refilled and I came with another person who didn't even get a water cup. I know they didn't order anything but it is still common courtesy to offer water if someone is sitting at the table.

The noodles are good, I've tried their rice noodles and korean noodles before and the texture of the noodles consist of bounce and bite. That is what I look for so I do commend the noodles. The broths I have had are the fish with pumpkin and tomato and tom yum. The fish broth is light and great for those days where you are feeling sick. The tomyum is rich and a bit salty for my taste. It also has a bit of tangy and spicy which I found enjoyable. I think the restaurant should hire new employees but keep the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Mekong Plaza together and, after browsing in a couple of the stores, decided to have some lunch.
This restaurant happened to be located closest to where we were in the mall so we checked out the menu and decided to give it a try.

My girlfriend and I shared a bowl of noodle soup with fish soup base, vermicelli noodles, beef tendon balls, and Hong Kong dumplings.
The portion size was was plenty for the both of us.

The broth was authentic enough for a small restaurant this located in a mall. It was satisfying with fairly good depth of flavor, which is, of course, the most important component of noodle soup.
There was a decent amount of noodles in the dish, the consistency and flavor of which was good, and it did not taste like the instant noodles they sometimes use in restaurants like this.
The beef tendon was tender and flavorful, the veggies were cooked properly, and the dumplings were a nice, yummy addition to the dish.

My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, was quite satisfied, which is a very good sign when it comes to this type of cuisine.
The service was good but perhaps a bit slow (they were rather busy when we were there), the prices were reasonable, and we both agreed that this is a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite noodle restaurants. Really authentic Cantonese food. The noodle with fish soup is awesome. And there is tens of topping you can choose to add to your noodle soup. Clay pot rice is another good choice."}
{"text":"On a whim my wife and I decided to eat here since there was a dust storm outside.
     Simple stated we had a very good meal. We both had soup along with an app. There are so many choices for your soup and everything satisfies perfectly. They even give you a good amount of shrimp and dumpling if you so desire. You could eat here for months and never get tired with so many choices.
     Give them a try and you won't be unhappy."}
{"text":"Design your own soup! This is the perfect way to warm up on a chilly day. The menu is pretty self explanatory. Check off your broth, type of noodles, protein, and other toppings. You can also request no cilantro, etc. They also offer cheap appetizers and clay pot dishes.

I had a little bit of some laksa soup and indulged mainly in the appetizers. The appetizers were well executed. The chicken wings were juicy with a light crispness and well seasoned. The fried fish was perfectly crispy with tender fish inside. The fried buns were excellent as well, and were very fresh and piping hot. 

The laksa soup was lighter tasting and more watery than I'm used to, but overall had decent flavor and definitely had a spicy kick to it. The clay pot dish (spare ribs) was tasty as well and the spare ribs were very tender.

The menu also allows you to check off your drink of choice as well, but only has selections for tea or coffee. They do have soda (Coke products) but you have to write them in. 

Service was decent and our order came out fairly quickly. Overall I'll come here again if I'm in a noodle soup mood."}
{"text":"I've been here countless time. If I want to eat soup and shop grocery, this is the only place I will get my fish soup with several different add-ons. 

If you coming at lunch time over the weekend, you will wait probably 30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Great place when it's cold outside! Came in for dinner with two friends last night and it was all of our first time. The waitstaff was nice and provided us with menus that had some photos upon request as we had no idea what we were ordering. I got the Laksa and it was just spicy enough. The Szechwan my friend ordered was a bit spicer than my Laksa but still tasty and the other soup that my girlfriend ordered was the Chicken broth which she said was delicious as well. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this new restaurant for dinner last night.  I thought the concept of a build your own noodle soup was interesting and was anxious to try it.  I had the chouchou (spelling?) broth, while he had the spicy thai one.  Mine was pretty good, if you enjoy a fish broth.  His was very spicy.  We also tried the fried fish and fried pork chops.  Both were kind of bland and mediocre.  I wish they included pictures or more descriptive explanations of what the broths were because we had a hard time choosing without knowing what exactly we were ordering.  Overall, the price point is decent, the food is not disappointing nor spectacular, and the service was friendly.  I would recommend trying it, but just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I was warned to go here.. so i stayed away, but i am thinking they thought it was still the previous restaurant.  My experience was great, the ordering system is pretty cool: you pick your soup base, noodles, and ingredients. try to order the basics, adding too much into your soup will complicate it.  oh and it comes with a drink, get the coffee."}
{"text":"UPDATE: OK! So I've been reading a lot of other people's reviews about their service being mad! It's not that bad! I feel like they've gotten better! The only thing is, they're not really paying attention to when you're done! They probably expect you to come to the front and pay for your meal there. Overall it's still good! 

I like this place for lunch! So simple, and the noodles are awesome!!!!! Definitely have to choose wisely though, cause there are some items on the menu that are not really worth adding to your soup. I always get dumplings or Hong Kong style dumplings, to add as much eat as possible to my dish!

Anyways love the different broths you can get. Don't expect anything fancy at this place, but it's a great place to get lunch! Especially in the winter time! Not sure why the reviews on this place are pretty low? 

Tips: 
1) Get the Dan Dan Noodles! It's located on the back of your paper and it's only $5.75! Plus you get soup! It's so good! AND you get a small bowl of soup!"}
{"text":"At first I was a bit hesitant about eating here. The name for some reason reminded me of deer horn and what kind of food does a \"Deer Garden\" serve anyways?

Once inside though I discovered that DGS is actually a pretty popular chain serving up big bowls of noodles and clay pot dishes. It's confusing but enticing menu lets you choose your own adventure with a variety of sides, broth, and noodles you pick from. I went with the Szechuan spicy soup, big noodles, brisket, luncheon meat (spam), and brisket. 

The result was........ SPICY and really good. Think Neoguri but in a hearty fish broth and way better noodles. It was hard to put down but when I finally did I had enough left for a meal the next day. I also tried some of my friends Hong Kong won ton soup but it paled compared to my garlicky spicy bowl. The only downside to the meal was the stringy brisket which carried the added sin of being a bit flavorless. 

I'd come back to Deer Garden just for this tear-causing broth but the other dishes on the menu look quite appetizing as well. One of the better chains out there, though on their website all their other chains seem to be in Canada.

What Kay said below is pretty much what the service is like - pretty non-existent. (Some  asian restaurants have those wireless call bells but here you have to wave em down ^^\")"}
{"text":"Very tasty tomato and pumpkin broth. Huge portion. Could only eat half. Love how you custom order. Service is quick. Milk iced tea is gooood."}
{"text":"I've been here for at least 6 times in the past two months, my review is based on my experiences but not random first impression. Each time I came here, I tried different soups. Their food actually taste good and the size of soup bowl is reasonable. But I didn't care about the snacks, such as chicken wings, Chinese sweet buns etc. They are not amazing and you can probably make the same thing in 10 minutes at home. I want to talk about their service, one word: SUCKS! First of all, it takes so long for them to place a order, the waiters and waitress here really like to chat with each other. I understand they are all friends, but please keep your eyes on customers as well. Secondly, it takes 20 minutes for them to deliver a dish. One time I came here for lunch, I waited at least 20 minutes for my dish, the restaurant wasn't even busy at that time. I believe most of people have an hour lunch break and they probably have to drive here and park, so really you will only have 10-15 minutes to eat the food. Thirdly, the waitress and waiters are so rude! My friend and I came here in an evening, two of us, they told us to \"sit anywhere you want\", so we sat at a small round table. The waitress came here and said \"can you move to a different table?\", I asked why? She said \"because this is a table for four or five, you only have two people.\" I said \"well, you told us to sit anywhere we like.\" She was like \"but not a big table, we have table for two, can you please move to there? When more people come in, they don't have place to sit\". I told them we could move when a group of five show up; nope, never happened. I don't think the tall guy with glasses speaks English. Every time I wanted to ask him a question, he wasn't able to understand. I asked what comes in with with a rice bowl, he said one work \"rice...\", or he stood there and looked at me without saying anything. There's no words to describe how stupid and awkward when moments like these happen."}
{"text":"Soup was ok, but took over an hour for soup during a Friday lunch. My wife had to skip out on most of her meal.  The selection was pretty interesting, though.  The flavor was good, but not great. I may try once more, but my wife certainly won't."}
{"text":"If you want some noodles, here is a place you can try. The portion is decent, service is fine. And they did their noodles good. Hopefully they can have some dumpling dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude place!! We walked in the place and it was full. The only table available is a 5 seat one. The server, later called himself manager, told us we were not allowed to sit at that table because we don't have 5 people in our party. We were told to share another five seat table with two other parties, one of the party is an employee having lunch break. My husband was totally shocked by the demand. You can drive all over PHX and I bet you cannot find a restaurant with a table available but won't allow customers to sit down, instead, demand them to share a table with other parties. Just imagine you are sitting there eating and chatting with your loved one and suddenly, the waiter bring some people to your table and told you they are going to sit next to you at your table. So, you better shut up and eat and leave. I am from China. 30 years ago, you had to share tables in the restaurant, maybe. But not anymore! Even you go to a small village, you don't share tables. What are they thinking? Charging American dollars but treat customer like a third world country?? Well, he called himself manager, I guess he doesn't care if the restaurant loses customers or not. We started going there to support them when they first opened with no customers. Not anymore! Not only we are not going, my husband said he is never going to take coworkers there for lunch anymore. They seem to do ok right now, but word of mouth can make or break a business fast."}
{"text":"I love the Wonton soup here, if im really hungry I will get the wontons and add beef balls and Hong Kong style dumplings, with the Szechuan broth!"}
{"text":"You pick your soup base, noodles and fixings. Soup base choices are chicken broth, Tom yum, fish, dried fish with minced pork among many others. Huge bowl. Soup was tasty and I had the fish soup (not too fishy) with thin egg noodles and pork intestines. It was a good balance. Small place, not fancy but clean."}
{"text":"Trang, I don't know what you're talking about. I can't live without this place. The Malay is liquid gold."}
{"text":"Good place to go when I wanted to eat noodle. The missing star is for the milk tea in the combo."}
{"text":"Alright so I've been here before, usually the food is actually pretty decent. But the service was pretty lackluster. Like I have no complaints about the food, but  we asked for water at the beginning of meal we finally got the waters after asking 3 times. you shouldn't have to ask for water more than once. Especially did you ask water right when you make your order."}
{"text":"I was there just now with my husband and kids. For a late lunch service is so horrible.. the 2 staff was was working didn't give us any service or eye contact.. they were both playing Snapchat.. and on their phone the whole time when we were there 45 minutes seriously.. food was bland and some are salty. I ask the server for onions that I order but never gave 
me , gave me a nasty look . Will never go back .. 
they don't even worth a star have to put one there to post this review.."}
{"text":"They took over the recently closed Chicken Noodle House restaurant.  I was hoping this place would be a winner because I love authentic Cantonese noodle soups.  They have a variety of specialty noodles and clay pots.  You can even design your own noodle soup.  Pick your noodles, toppings, and broth.  During my first visit, I tried their wonton noodle soup and chicken with mushroom clay pot.  Unfortunately, the wonton noodle soup didn't quite meet my expectation.  The broth had too much sesame oil flavor.  I would prefer that they didn't use any sesame oil.  The wontons themselves wasn't good at all.  There were small hard pieces in the filling and the flavor was very one dimensional.  The egg noodles they used was good and the broth wasn't too bad.  The clay pot with chicken and mushroom was pretty good.  It took 20 minutes for them to cook it.  The chicken was tender.  There was a nice hint of ginger flavor.  The clay pot also had chinese bok choy and a bed of rice on the bottom.  The fish broth that came with the clay pot was definitely not my cup of tea.  It was way too fishy tasting.  I took a sip and left it there.  Eww!  

Overall, the restaurant is okay.  I wouldn't mind going back to try some of the other dishes but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went to Deer Garden Signature last night with my wife for dinner.  We had just returned from our Labor Day Week trip.  

I ordered a fish soup with dumpling, fish balls, and Korean crystal noodles.  My wife ordered preserved pork in a clay pot.  

The preserved pork in clay pot did not seem to interest me.  To me it looked like sausage with rice, and nothing particularly interesting.

The soup was actually pretty good.  My wife and I liked it much better.  

The only thing we think they could have done better is the following:

My wife and I were not exactly familiar with the style of food.  My wife is Vietnamese.  Maybe as part of the banner for the restaurant they should put Guandong Style Cuisine under the name.  

Otherwise the food is pretty good.

{"text":"Noodles represent longevity in many cultures. This is the reason why they make an integral part of birthday celebrations --- just like candles and cake!  It's also a tradition to consume noodles in Japan on New Year's Eve.

So technically I stopped by on New Year's Eve's Eve but hey, it still counts, right?  I've been curious about this chain for a while and while the reviews made me wary, I'm glad to have finally stopped in.  My friend from Seattle was in town for his yearly Christmas vacation and he caught the bug so we figured a nice warm bowl of soup would be comforting.  For $9.50 a pop, it certainly hit the spot!

So he got the Hong Kong style wonton soup; I had the parsley & century egg fish soup with Spam, HK style dumplings, and Korean-style sweet potato crystal noodles; and a Thai tom yum goong soup with HK style dumplings, braised bamboo shoots, and thick egg noodles was ordered between the three of us.  Everything was surprisingly delicious!  I really enjoyed my bowl of noodles but I think I'll definitely go for the Thai Tom Yum soup next time.  It was insanely flavorful.  I do wish they gave more Spam.  I had chosen hot milk tea for my beverage and it's definitely not the most aromatic.  Considering it comes with the meal, I wasn't expecting much.  I suggest asking for condensed milk if you order the milk tea.  We also shared an order of fried buns towards the end of our meal, which comes as a trio. Get this.  Just do it.  

All in all, I had a great meal and wouldn't mind stopping in again!  Portions are huge.  Service isn't the most attentive but it's the kind of shut-up-and-eat-your-gawd-damn-food kinda eatery that us Asians are use to.  So shut up and slurp your effing noodles, bruh!  #SendMeNoods"}
{"text":"Still the best value in Mekong Plaza ! Excellent WonTon Soup and fried fish appetizer. The dumplings are tasty and wholesome and the BokChoy is cooked to perfection 
Dinner is always delicious here"}
{"text":"Gosh this place has the potential to be amazing but because I'm not a regular, I didn't know exactly what to order.  I wish they had pictures of the types of noodles that we could choose from so I knew what I was doing.  I ordered the Original Fish Soup broth with Instant Noodles (basically ramen) and added seaweed, fried egg, beef brisket, fish balls and sliced squid.  For $8.95 you get to choose a broth, 2 toppings and a milk tea ($1 more if you get iced milk tea, which in my opinion was NOT good - it tasted like overbrewed Lipton tea with a splash of milk).  Each additional topping is $1.  I definitely overdid it with my toppings - next time I'll pass on the fried egg, squid and seaweed.  

My husband ordered Gingko & Pepper Fish broth with instant noodles with bok choy and sliced beef briskets.  The bowl came out without the brisket and when he went to tell them, she didn't believe him and came back to the table with our original written order and had him \"fish\" around the bowl with his chopsticks to make sure there were indeed no briskets in there.  So odd.  By the time hubs was almost done with his meal, a small bowl of brisket came out. 

We also ordered 4 appetizers which were pretty small, comparable to tapas.  Two of the appetizers never came out, they even circled it on the receipt yet still charged us for it.  When we questioned them, she basically said, \"oh yeah.  ok, well do you want them or do you want me to take it off the bill?\"   Since we didn't know when we'd be back and heard that the buns were delish, we said we'd wait for them.  Glad we waited because both the fried pork chop (small serving and 2 each) and the Deep fried bun were so good.  As a courtesy, they also gave us a side of their wings which were super good. 

So service is a bit off, the food was pretty good - and I'd definitely come back again so I can try to perfect my noodle dish."}
{"text":"Have walked by this restaurant so many times we finally decided to try it out. 

Located in Mekong Plaza at the main entrance. 

You select your soup base, two items and then a noodle.

Most of the soup base are a fish type and then there are a great selection of items to include in your soup base for $8.50. 

There are sides for less than $2.00, we tried the pork chops and wings which was like a tapas.

I looked on the back of the menu and decided to play it safe with the Hong Kong Style Won Ton Noodle Soup which was a great choice.  My wife was more adventurous and ordered a concoction with fish soup base. Was definitely very fishy but good with a lot of ingredients. 

Of course inside Mekong Plaza there are many selections to eat, this place deserves another time to come back to try different soups.

The service is not the greatest and you have to pull the servers to your table and for the bill.

One tip is the restaurant is 98% Asians and mostly young college student age so you know it is good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been eyeing this place for a while. We finally decided to give it a try this weekend. They don't have many selections when it comes to soft drinks so be aware. As soon as you sit down, they will give you a menu allowing you to check off what items you want for your noodle soup, broth and noodles of your choice. Very neat. We all ordered few appetizers. One of which was the \"Fried bun\". It comes with total of 3 and it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered fried chicken wings and it was juicy and tasty. I wish it would have come with more than just 2 per dish. For entree, I ordered my childhood favorite, spare rib with black beans in clay pot. The rice was cooked just the way I like it, spare ribs are not as favorable and I did not taste any black beans at all. Overall it is decent. Not spectacular. I will come back here to try more appetizers and possibly their noodle dish. 

Service was decent and polite. The restaurant is relatively clean and spacious."}
