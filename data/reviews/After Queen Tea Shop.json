{"text":"Went to AQTS with best friend on a weekday. Very nice Victorian decor.    For $38, you will have four different finger sandwiches: smoked salmon, cucumber, egg salad & chicken cranberry. Two scones with Devonshire cream & jam. Petit four sweets. One made to order daily quiche and green salad. One loose tea from 25+ selections offered.    Sandwich bread came from bakery at same plaza. Fresh made daily.    Scones are ok to me, a bit dry. I had tried better scones at Blue Willow Tea Shop Muskoka.   For me personally, #1 scone in Ontario is Blue Willow Tea Shop.  #2 is Windsor Arms. #3 is After Queen.    Service is pretty attentive.   Reservation IS highly recommended. All tables were occupied when left.    Have a happy afternoon tea!   It also offers crepes. Price ranges from $10-$15."}
{"text":"wonderful atmosphere.  the owner is very attentive and the crepes are light and fresh.  love going there with my daughter or friends."}
{"text":"Cute place. Great food and quiet. The decor and atmosphere are great for a high tea. We paid $30 pp which is very reasonable. The ladies working there were very attentive and courteous.  I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"The service was bad.           There are 2 set menu's afternoon tea and high tea, a $10/person difference between the two. We made a reservation for 9 for high tea thinking high tea was a general term. Once we got there and decided we wanted afternoon tea we were declined and said we had to get high tea since they had already made the quiches according to our reservation. We explained that we made a mistake and wanted to change to afternoon tea but was again declined. We felt like we were forced to choose high tea, now wondering how many others fell into this trap. A poor server had to be the middle man and tell us no this and sorry that while the owner was hiding in the kitchen giving orders.         There was no apology or explaination from management.           While we were sitting waiting for our tea a spider fell on my cousins arm! How clean is this place?           The food was alright which is the only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star.          When we were about to leave another couple came in with reservations and guess who came out to greet them....the owner....I will never come back to a place where I am not respected"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. I didn't know we were supposed to make a reservation, but luckily they had space for us. The place had an English/Victorian vibe and felt quite homey. The food was delicious considering the price, and they had an exceptional tea selection. The lady who served us was also extremely friendly, and helped us take a photo as we were having some problems. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"To those looking for a hidden gem and a date place. Great price, delicious organic tea and cutest tea shop ever run by an adorable couple. They caterers to our needs for the bridal shower we planned. Fully endorse and not downtown with such attentive service. We all said we wanted to come back and being friends."}
{"text":"Had a truly lovely afternoon tea at this adorably decorated tea room. The place itself is hidden in a tiny mall - the main advantage being that parking is not a problem at all. Once you find this gem of a place, you are transported to a beautiful English tea room which has a cosy and intimate ambience without being cramped for space.   The menu was simple but had more than enough options and I chose the Buckingham Palace Tea, which I highly recommend! A classic and elegant Earl Grey that complemented the food very well. My friends and I went for the Classic Afternoon Tea - which was great value at $28 pp and came with a variety of sandwiches, pastries and scones. Everything was well presented in charming floral teacups and tiered trays. What I generally look forward to in a tea are the scones and these were no disappointment, being just the right size and crumbly texture. Delicious with a bit of jam and Devonshire cream. I could've done with a bit more cream but that's just me. What surprised me were the sandwiches - each of which were crafted to perfection and an absolute delight. My favourites were the smoked salmon and chicken salad. Of the pastries that I tried, the lemon square was a little too tangy for my taste although I know my Mom would've loved it. The one that stood out for me was the fruit tart with mint custard..so good!  The service was exceedingly warm and welcoming. What I loved was the attention to detail and the timely refilling of our teapots. This tea room ranks as one of my favourites so far and, although I live 45 minutes away, I will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"Great tea room with quality service.  You always get more than what you pay for here, the owner is very friendly and the service is top notch. Classy interior, classical music and white table cloth service at Starbucks prices, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Facility: South of John St, north of Steeles on the east side of the road. Pull into the Longo's plaza at Laureleaf Rd. Ample parking space. After Queen is located inside the mall beside Longos.   It is a cute little establishment with soft lighting, lots of Victorian decor. Washroom is small but cleanly. Ambiance tends to be very quiet, so you speak in very low voices or other tables can hear your conversation. Nice for pairs or parties of 3 or 4, not ideal for big groups.  Food Quality & Price: At $28/person for afternoon tea, I'd say it was reasonably priced for the area. Food amounts and ratios for afternoon tea were perfect. First level of sandwiches (all soft, fresh and delicious. Scones could be better, but still yummy. Comes with jam and devonshire cream. Dessert level was also well done. At many places, they overdo the \"sweets\" part of the tiers, but After Queen gets it right.  Tea's themselves were nice, I enjoyed the Earl Grey as I usually do. Wish the pot was refilled more often. Sugar and cream/milk are made available on the table.   Service: Was nice and as expected. Not much else to say.  Overall: It's a cute place to try. Decent price, good food. It's a little far from me so I may or may not return. I would give 3.5/5 stars, so for Yelp purposes I rounded down to 3."}
{"text":"The place is indeed small but fortunately I could get a table even without a reservation. It would seem pricey at first but after the experience, I would say it's worth it. Everything is so fine and elegant here. Love the interior, love the choices of tea available"}
{"text":"Lovely little tea shop in uptown area. Friendly staff and warm atmosphere. We did high tea and enjoyed a beautiful three tier serving of finger sandwiches, scones and desserts, along with our own pot of tea. We were full by the scones layer. Nice to have something like this local for an afternoon treat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 1pm to try out the afternoon tea. We made sure to book ahead as recommended by other yelp reviews and can concur that it was good advice, by booking ahead the restaurant was able prepare our food before hand. The dining area is quite small and everyone else there had booked ahead, so if we had come without reservations we would have had to wait.  The décor inside is very British, the walls are decorated with fancy plates and British paintings, the tea sets were really fancy schamncy too.   We ordered the afternoon tea for 2 ($28 per person) which came with a choice of 2 loose leaf teas as well as an assortment of finger sandwiches (egg salad sandwich, cucumber sandwich, smoked salmon on bread etc.), scones and desserts! We got the chamomile tea and peppermint, both very good choices. The food filled us up as well!   Overall a good experience and a good place for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"My hubby taken me to this tea shop on Valentine's Day. He had made an appointment in advance. We got there and it was a quaint decorated little shop. The decor was very interesting and so many little quirky details. There are no windows around but instead filled with China plate decor. Once I got there I was surprised there were only 2 other tables on Valentine's Day. But it was a nice to have more room for ourselves. We got a table in the corner. The music playing from outside could be heard inside the shop which was nice instrumentals. The staff was nice and friendly, although the waitress I only saw her in the beginning. Then the owner started serving us.  I ordered the patisserie tea which was very good with cream and sugar. It was sweet and a delight. My hubby got a fruity go go berry tea which was very aromatic.  The sandwiches were good. We ate all of them. The scones were good too, needed more jam and clotted cream. The small petit fours we ended up packing away as we stayed from 430-6 and it was closing by then.  It was a nice option for us to take it away since we were both super full from the sandwiches.  The China that was used was super cute! I loved it all. We opted for the afternoon tea which is $28 pp  I believe there is a high tea option that includes quiche and salad for $38   In my opinion it was a good price for afternoon tea as other places I've gone to go for $50 pp.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is a great uptown tea place to take your friends or family for afternoon tea. A friend of mine told me to check out this place so we got a group of girlfriends for a fun afternoon tea time. We decided to do the afternoon tea time versus the high tea and there was plenty to go around. The sandwiches were fresh and the presentation was nice. We especially liked the old decor and once you go into the quaint place, you forgot it is inside a small strip plaza. The tea selection was great and unique. I had the French macaroon tea and it went well with my scones, sandwiches and little pastries. If you live in uptown Toronto and looking for a good place to have high tea or afternoon tea, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"We went there today, love the restaurant. The high tea tray is very delicious. Good ambience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never been a fan of desserts, but this was alright.  Decor is very well-themed.  It's a british style afternoon tea or high tea place, with lots stained glass on the back wall, a lot of antiques such as telephones, old dressers, lots of china sets, and English art (paintings) hung on the walls. I can imagine a lot of people would enjoy the atmosphere.  They primarily serve 2 packages for tea time,  One is afternoon tea ($28/person) which includes 3-tiers of finger foods (sandwiches, pastries, dessert cakes), with a pot of tea of your choice. Second is the high tea, which includes everything in the afternoon tea but also an individual green salad and a quiche for $10 more per person.  I got the Pomegranate Goji green tea, which is fruity and semi sweet.  Definitely a strong green tea after taste for those who like it. I didn't mind it.  The aroma is very sweet and nice though.  Let's talk food..  Sandwiches include smoked salmon, classic cucumber, chicken salad Always a fan, best food in my opinion.  Scones + clotted cream + jam Scones were a little tough but the clotted cream made up for it.  It's very soft and goes well with the scone.  Jam adds more sugary flavour to it, if you're into sweets.  Cakes includes strawberry cheesecake, brownie, lemon tart Didn't try any of it, the wife ate it all, so can't comment here.  Service is a bit slow even though it wasn't that busy, so that is a bit concerning for me.  The staff always seemed to be in the kitchen so we never got any service when we needed it; we had to wait maybe 5 minutes every time we wanted something (more hot water, a box for take out, the bill)."}
{"text":"What a delight! This lovely spot has a good selection of teas. The quiche is really good, the ratio of cheese to broccoli to crust was just right. And then comes the desserts and finger sandwiches. The cheesecake was divine, the scones still warm and ready for Devon cream and fresh jam, and the sandwiches were scrumptious.  Service was attentive, but not intrusive. There is a cosy, warm vibe in the shop, and the decor added that something extra to the experience. This establishment deserves 5 stars, but I felt the cost was rather high. Overall, it was a beautiful time."}
{"text":"Uhmazing!!!!!   The decor Is straight out of what you'd imagine an English grandmothers house looking like. Porcelain dolls scattered around, lots of antique paintings. Very cute!  The staff are attentive and very kind.   We ordered the afternoon high tea that comes with a delicious albeit piping hot broccoli quiche with cheese. Well made and seasoned quiche with a delicious crust. Someone knows what they're doing in the kitchen.   The sandwiches were classic and super fresh and delicious. The smoked salmon was perfectly proportioned and with fresh dill with horseradish. Wonderful!  The egg salad was bomb.  The chicken salad with grapes was super tasty and sweet and crispy. Perfection.   The scones were nice. The Devon cream was skimpy but who cares the rest of it was lovely and if you ask for more Devon cream they may bring you seconds. The strawberry jam was bomb.   Perfect.   Seriously."}
{"text":"This tea shop is located inside the mall of the Longo plaza. Hidden gem.   The noise level is a bit high. I guess because there was a birthday celebration in front of me. The room only fits approximately 25 people at max. There are some outside sitting in the plaza area.  The smoked salmon was tasty, it was very fresh.  The egg salad sandwich was also tasty. Everything is a good portion for afternoon high tea.  The scones were fresh.  The waitress keeps checking our tea to make sure it's refilled.  This place is definitely comparable to downtown afternoon tea spots. Will take my husband here next time!"}
{"text":"This establishment was a huge disappointment. When you go for high tea, you expect the place to be charming in some way, and to have some decent level of service.. at the very least. The place itself is a tiny room.. empty on a Sunday afternoon. It was actually very underwhelming. But the terrible service is the reason why I will never come back again.   We selected \"afternoon tea\" on the menu but was told that we booked \"high tea\" on the phone. High tea was $38 (vs $28 for afternoon tea) and only difference was a quiche and some greens. I've been to high tea a couple of times elsewhere, including at Windsor Arms and Shang Gri La, and when you reserve for \"high tea\", there is only ONE meaning and ONE price to it.   First of all, nobody explained that two options even existed when I reserved on the phone. Secondly, a couple of us don't even like quiches. Why would we pay $10 extra for something we don't want? When I explained this to the server, she informed us that no changes were allowed because \"the quiches were already in the oven\". WE LITERALLY JUST GOT THERE?! I think it would've been wise for them to make sure that they got their guests' orders right first AND THEN prepare the food?? It just seemed like a really lame excuse to make the extra money off of my party of 6. When we explained our frustration that we were basically being forced to select something we didn't even want, their solution was they could pack the quiches and salad \"to go\" and just serve the tea and finger foods... but STILL CHARGE US FOR THE \"high tea\". Ummm.... they were completely missing the point. There were two Asian ladies in the kitchen that were making all the decisions (relaying messages to the server) but made no effort to talk to us in person. One eventually came out to get rid of a SPIDER found at our table (yup.....), but didn't say a word until I asked if she was the owner and all she said was \"no\" and went back to the kitchen.   As customers, we felt we were misinformed about the menu options, and then taken advantage of. We felt we weren't being listened to. Our server was ok, but looked frazzled and annoyed, and didn't know how to deal with anything. Everything just seemed really unprofessional. We REALLY contemplated just walking out (I wish we did)... but felt that that was too rude and it was our friend's birthday after all. We felt like we should just suck it up.   The desserts were comparable to what you would get at Sobeys. There is nothing special about it.   If you want a nice high tea experience, do yourself a favor and go to any other establishment. Because of the poor service and blah food, this feels like a cheap version of high tea. As a comparison, the beautiful (downtown) Shang Gri La's high tea costs $42.. and this costed $38."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for my experience here but was really disappointed as this was supposed to be part of my Christmas gift to my mother and we didn't have a great experience. I get the sense they can't keep up with the demand and that they're not very organized. There's potential here (décor is great, ambiance is nice) but here's a rundown of what happened during my visit:  ___________  I made reservations for the 27th because all of the popular spots downtown were fully booked. The reviews for After Queen looked really great so I decided to take a chance on it and come here with my mother, siblings and nephews.   I called to make a reservation but it was really difficult for me to understand what the gentleman on the other end was saying. At the end of it all, I knew I made reservations for my group and that we were interested in the High Tea.   Upon arriving, a table was put together for us and a server came over to take our orders. We had decided to go with the Classic Afternoon Tea option instead and to order crepes instead of having the quiche and salad that came with the High Tea. The server said that we had pre-ordered the High Tea option and that the food was already made, and we got the impression that it would be an issue. Eventually we were able to order what we wanted even though it didn't seem like anyone else there needed to pre-order their food.  Our server came over with our tea and gave my mother the peppermint even though she had clearly pointed to the chamomile on the menu and the server had repeated it back. She insisted that it was what my mother had ordered until I confirmed that it was incorrect. It was taken back.  Another staff member came by to tell us that the crepes we wanted to order would take too long and that they didn't want for us to wait. So, you're telling me that at an afternoon tea restaurant where the only options are the afternoon tea platters and crepes-- that you can't make the crepes in time? My brother and I had both ordered the same crepe that only had THREE ingredients. They couldn't tell us how long it would be but that we'd wait for them.  The sandwiches and scones arrived and the quality was okay. We finished all of it and asked about the crepes, and we saw the same woman come back with groceries from the Longos next door. She said they were being made but at this point it had been nearly an hour and we were full. Clearly the crepes weren't being made so we cancelled that.   After leaving we were given two extra mini cupcakes for my nephews but it didn't make up for this less than stellar experience. I think I'll stick to the places I know to be the best like the King Edward Hotel.  I have to give After Queen kudos for trying, but it blew my mind at just how disorganized everything felt. I think this establishment could use some more seasoned advice on how to manage their restaurant especially when it comes to afternoon tea which is supposed to be a more elegant and refined experience."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience to have Afternoon Tea with friends: sipping on fragrant teas, nibbling on dainty finger sandwiches and enjoying petite desserts. All of the food are made fresh in house and crafted with attention to the smallest detail. My favorites were the egg sandwich, scone and mini tart topped with fresh fruit.   Our ladies group of 21 adults and 5 children were very pleased with our visit here on Monday at 11am. Each person received their own pot of tea and each group of two received a tier of sandwiches, scones and desserts to share; the last three in our group received a bigger tier of food to share. We received excellent service and enjoyed our time there immensely.  TIPS - Make reservations in advance. The seating capacity inside is 30, there are also tables outside. Make sure you get a confirmation! You will need to make a deposit to hold your reservation for a large group.  - There are no highchairs so if your child can't sit in a chair on their own, either have them sit in your lap or bring a small stroller for them to sit in. Take your child outside if they get too loud. If you don't do it yourself you may be asked by the staff to do it, for the sake of the other patrons. - Check out the menu and tea selections beforehand so you can place your order as soon as you get there. There is a two hour time limit, which is more than enough if you're organized. - Come dressed for a tea party: fancy hat, pretty outfit, sexy shoes. Hey, it's a good excuse to dress up, plus you don't want the decor to outshine you (lace table cloth, fancy bone china, antiques). - Take tons of pictures: lots of mirrors, lovely lighting, antique phones (to use as props), and let's not forget the beautiful tea sets. - Chat up the lovely owner (Julia), the sweet waitress (Laima), and the friendly patrons. it's definitely a relaxed atmosphere here.  I know there's some men out there that like to dress up as well; come in your most trendy, fashionable European outfit. Now if your not into dressing up and making a big deal out of your afternoon tea, come for a relaxing pot of tea and a light tasty meal (fancy outfit not required)."}
{"text":"Great tea selection, and the sandwiches were perfect. Their macaron was a little too chewy, but this is a great little place to go for high tea if you don't want to trek into the city. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came to After Queen with my friend for a really girly afternoon tea session.  We both love afternoon tea so we decided to check this place out. The decor is so cute and detailed! Everything in the shop is tea/British themed - even down to the nightlight on a random plug haha. It's cute.  We ordered the HIGH TEA set: * Scones with Devon cream & jam * Sandwiches (cucumber, smoked salmon, apple) * Quiches with mixed green salad * Desserts  We called in advance to book for high tea - they make the quiches in advance, so it is recommended that you book beforehand. It was very filling but everything was delish! The service was excellent - they checked on us in good intervals.   I'll revisit again :)"}
{"text":"The best and most classic British Afternoon Tea I have ever had! The scone tastes really awesome! Lemon Merigue is my wife's favourite:) The boss is real nice and the restaurant is beautiful and quiet. I will definitely come back again recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Been there many times. The food is very fresh and. Nice. Location is very convenient for me. Good the have the tea shop nearby."}
{"text":"Came for afternoon tea on a Sunday afternoon. The place was not too busy but we had reservations which are recommended. The restaurant itself is a little tough to find as there is poor signage outside. It is inside a little strip mall. Decor reminds you of your slightly senile grandmother's house.   Afternoon tea comes with your choice of tea, cucumber, chicken salad, egg salad and smoked salmon sandwiches, two different types of scones and an assortment of desserts. The sandwiches were just okay and nothing special - taste very similar to something my mom would make at home. The scones were fine. Desserts were quite tasty and I'm not usually a dessert person but I highly doubt they were actually made in house.   Service was okay. The chef came out and explained what was on our tray which was nice but our actual server was a bit inattentive.   Overall a cute little place which is much less pricey and busy than the downtown Toronto tea places. Don't expect gourmet food here but you will definitely have a nice time."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and it's literally right by my home but tucked into the mall so you don't see it from the outside. The place itself is quite small, only a few tables but it's adorned in a very traditional English way and perfect for a girls day out or afternoon tea with your mom.   They have afternoon tea for $28 or high tea for $38. High tea is afternoon tea (tea, scones, finger sandwiches, pastries) along with a small quiche and green salad. The quiche and salad came first and it was good but honestly, I was full after that. The afternoon tea set came in pretty tiered plates after that but I  only had a few. The high tea is VERY filling!   The atmosphere inside is very good, service is wonderful, food tastes yummy and overall a good experience If you like English style afternoon tea, this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"A very quaint place with yummy food and delicious tea.  Staff: We didn't have a reservation but they had a table that just needed clearing so it took a couple minutes before we were seated. They were very quick in serving us, however they didn't really check up on us so it took us a bit in getting the bill. However, it is understandable because high tea and it's almost expected for people to just chat and drink tea for hours.  Ambience: The place is adorned with fine china and old timey items. It's a small place but you could fit two large tables of 8 and still have room for a couple small tables of 2. It definitely had a warm intimate feel with the classic wall paper and warm lighting.  Food/Tea: The Classic Afternoon Tea combo was fitting because I had gotten there around 2pm. I ordered a Macaron Green Tea which was perfect for me because I'm not fond of strong teas. It was light and had this hint of vanilla. The afternoon tea combo came with Raisin Scones and Plain Scones with Devon Cream and jam but I found them dry. Finger sandwiches included: Smoked Salmon, Egg Salad, Chicken Salad, and Cucumber Sandwiches. They were all quite yummy especially the Chicken one because they had added some fruits to it so it made it quite unique for me. And finally for the petit fours there was a Maple Macaron, a Nutella Tart, a Fruit Tart, and a Cheesecake Bite Topped with Strawberry, but none of them really wowed me.  Sandwiches were great, tea was amazing and the décor was excellent!"}
{"text":"Spent several hours here for a birthday party. Small group of women with an infant. The service was unobtrusive and warm. Clean restaurant. Would have preferred a bit more cream and jam with the scones. Extremely fresh bread walked over from the bakery next door."}
{"text":"Good and ambience are good, but it really got me that their servers cannot multitask. Expect bring asked to wait at outside the door, even when they are empty tables.  Sandwiches were fresh, scones were also nice, but the top tier desserts were a bit soggy during our visit.  Nice selection of teas. Tab k es are a bit small.  I opted to sit outside so that i didn't have to put up with the waitress who couldn't handle only a few tables and was running around like a chicken without a head, while accomplishing very little.  The mall has a lot of natural light so that was a pretty relaxing afternoon."}
{"text":"Cute tea shop with the European style decorations, it's if you were in a tea shop in London.   Make reservations. For the time that I visited, the place was packed, and unlike a normal tea shop or dessert place, people dont just eat and go. They stay for a quite a while to sip on tea while chatting away for hours.   We got the afternoon tea deal which comes with a pot of tea. Tea itself was a bit too heavy. The sweets and savouries were decent, but most of them did not wow me."}
{"text":"A hidden gem ! I didn't even know this place existed inside the plaza. The entrance is to the right of Longos. Plenty of parking.   A great place for a date, afternoon with girlfriends. Once you step in it does feel as though you're in London with all the antique chinas and tiered displays. It was all thoughtfully decorated throughout the shop including the restrooms.   My friends and I had the Classic Afternoon Tea, which included your choice of loose-leaf tea, fresh scones with devon cream and jam, finger sandwiches and sweet petit fours. It was $28 pp, max of two hour seating and min. 2 people. They also have savoury or sweet crepes. if you do not want to order the afternoon tea. But who doesn't want to have tea here? Oh my!  Lots of choices for the tea (5 pages). I ended up getting the Pomergranate Goji. It's green tea, pomergranate, goji berries. I loved the aroma and taste as it was fruity.   Make sure if you make a reservation that the person on the other end is hearing you right. I had made a reservation for 1:30pm and at 12:00 noon that day, I had gotten a call whether I was still coming for my reservation at... 11:30am. I remember it was a man who had picked up the phone. Luckily there was still plenty of tables available when we arrived.   Presentation of our afternoon tea was impeccable. They nearly forgot the devon cream for the scones which is one of the best parts of tea imho. Yum! I would recommend eating the delicious scones first as they were toasty warm. Sandwiches were great as well. For the petite fours, I was a bit disappointed there was only one macaron and one fruit tart. You'd think everyone would get four pieces? I did not enjoy the lemon square dessert as it was a bit too sour. Otherwise, everything was amazing and I will definitely be coming back again. The service was friendly. Next time I may give them a 5. Close but there were a few hiccups."}
{"text":"The decor in this tiny teashop is very nice, as if you have just stepped into Victorian era. The food was amazing, namely the high tea set. For high tea, the portion is quite big, our order also came with a quiche and salad for each, which was too much food for two girls. Fairly a good amount of tea selection, and the waiter was quite cute too. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Having tried the high tea in Windsor Arms, this is a good alternative in uptown. We will come again!"}
{"text":"Great, super friendly service and cute atmosphere.    This is a British tea shop run by hospitable Chinese folk. The place is covered in British decor right down to the wallpaper. There is a strong attention to detail and they seek to ensure you have a pleasurable experience at their tea shop.  This shop is the inside of a small barely frequented mall. There is seating indoors and also outside in the mall area.  My mom and I came here without a reservation. We waited at the reception for about over 10 minutes.  No one came out from the kitchen. Eventually we knocked at the door and they were extremely apologetic so we appreciated that. If this happens to you, just knock at their kitchen door.  There is limited seating so you are better off making a reservation. Also that gives them time to prepare the food for your arrival. The scones are fresh and the desserts are cute. The sandwhiches are typical finger sandwhiches such as cucumber sandwich, smoked salmon n cream cheese, and egg sandwhich. We don't eat meat so they gave us extra smoked salmon sandwhiches.   The staff was very attentive and even offered to take pics for us.  The presentation of the meal is beautifully done and the tea selection is plentiful.  ALERT!!! The afternoon and high tea prices are per person, so you're looking at $60 total for two people with tax.  You can order other things instead like crepes or eggs etc.   I recommend this shop."}
{"text":"It's a tiny cute Victorian place hidden inside the corner plaza of Bayview and Laureleaf. I came with other ladies who checked the reviews and decided to meet here for tea time. It's so quiet. Can't laugh loud here. It's priced at $28 per person plus tax. There's quite a good selection of tea.  The 3 tiered plate came with different finger sandwiches like tuna, egg salad and smoked salmon. Also got sconces, pastries and one macaroon. I didn't get a macaroon though. And other plates seem to have different as our plate. Everything's yummy. If you're coming as a couple where you want to have a quiet peaceful teatime,this is a place for you. But as a group, I won't recommend it."}
{"text":"3.75 stars, which I've rounded up to 4. This is a nice little spot, with great decor and ambience (minus the very loud conversations nearby, but it's not the establishment's fault), in a small, unassuming strip mall among prime real estate.  We made reservations and we're glad we did, though they seemed pretty flexible. We went with the tea without quiche and we were happy with our choice. The tea selection was alright - I always like when they have samples for you to smell, which they didn't here, but it wasn't a huge deal. I thought our teas were okay.  I loved the presentation of their dishes. The savoury foods were really good - I really, really liked every single item, which is rare because there's almost always at least one item that I feel so-so at best about. But every single savoury item was really delicious.  The scones were good. I wish they were warmer, but we probably took too long eating the bottom tier first. I love that they are the jagged kind, which are crispy on the outside and taste way better than the smooth kinds the fancy hotels like to serve. The jam wasn't great, but it wasn't a deal-breaker.   The sweets were probably the weakest part - the fruit tart was nice and the chocolate cupcake was alright, but we didn't love the other items (Superwoman doesn't like cheesecake and I'm not into macarons, though I understand most people do.)  I still like the Old Curiosity Tea Shop better, but this location is a little more convenient - and parking certainly is easier. I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"TL:DR - Had to wait for table even with reservation made days before and was told to move tables AFTER we had started eating. Food and service were not good; they seemed unorganized. Will not be coming back. Save your money to go somewhere nicer.  ______  I am quite surprised by the many great reviews of this place because I experienced quite the opposite in terms what others have said regarding the service and food. The experience my mom and I had left us sour and we have already alerted all our friends and family not to come here due to the bad service and food.   My mom had gone here recently for crepes on a weekday with friends and had found the quite place charming and unique. That being said, during her time there, she saw many people having afternoon tea and wanted to try it herself.  During our visit, my mom and I had made reservations to try their afternoon tea set on a Saturday (she called the shop the previous Tuesday to reserve). She had told me after our meal that no one had picked up the phone when she first called on Tuesday and she left a voice mail for them. Since no one got back to her that Tuesday, she phoned the shop back and the lady who then picked up had told her that she didn't know how to access the voice mails on their phone system. It makes me wonder how many people have left voice mails which didn't get attended to.  Anyways, upon arriving to the tea shop, we stepped inside and no one greeted us. We had to find the shop employee who was by the cash register to let her know of our reservation at 1:30pm. Mind you, we had gotten there on time but she told us to wait as tables were still all full. She asked us if we wanted to sit in an outside area of the shop but I mean...who wants to sit in a plaza when the main attraction of the tea shop is the decor itself? We had to wait 15-20 mins to get seated even though we had a reservation which was pretty disappointing.   So we sat down, ordered our teas, and the food came out shortly as my mom had already told the shop what afternoon tea set we had wanted. We were busy eating our food and sipping our teas when suddenly, halfway through my scone, the shop employee asked us if we could move tables (we had already sat at that table for at least 20 mins). She wanted us to move to another table since she wanted to use the table we were currently sitting at to accommodate a large bridal party of 15. This request was unbelievable. Even in any restaurant setting, asking a customer to move when they are already seated and eating is ridiculous. My mom and I moved though because we were nice but this added to the disappointing experience we had.  During our stay at the tea shop we also saw that store employees were rushing another table to leave as they had been talking and eating for quite a while. I believe this move was due to the fact that there were other people waiting to be seated (I am not sure if they had reservations or not). This move however, is rude. Afternoon tea is an event that is enjoyed at a leisurely pace. I did not see any notes on the menu or signs saying there was a time limit to your stay at the shop.   Anyways, let's move onto the food. The food was forgettable and disappointing. There were an assortment of finger sandwiches (egg, cucumber, smoked salmon, and chicken) on the bottom tier. The egg and smoked salmon sandwiches were decent; the chicken, not so much. The scones on the middle tier that were provided were dry and a bit hard. I've definitely had better (I recommend Kitten and the Bear in Parkdale if you want delicious scones) and only one of the scones had raisins. On the top tier were 4 desserts (a cheesecake, macaron, fruit tart, and some type of apple dessert). The desserts were just not edible. The macaron was chewy, hard, and tough, and it didn't look or taste appealing (my cousin even makes better macarons at home). All the other desserts were average and just not appealing in taste and looks.   The only positive of this place is really the interior. The details in the plates and decor transport you to England. It feels as though you're sitting in an English tea shop somewhere in London. The environment is nice, but the food and service overall make for a disappointing experience. We will not be coming back to this place nor will we recommend anyone to go here."}
{"text":"I liked this tea shop. We went for afternoon tea with friends. The high tea aficionado in the group declared it to be in the top 5 of all her tea shop visits.  It is located in Thornhill, a great place to have a tea shop. It's in a plaza with longos and a Starbucks. Well not really a plaza, there's a little inside mall with even a small food court. The tea shop is inside there. The entrance is below a green tea shop sign. There's lots of free parking.  The tea shop entrance is really cute. There's actually some seating just at the entrance.  When you walk in, in small. There's a Toronto themed stain glass on one wall, and a giant mirror on the other. There's a delicate pick rose wallpaper on the wall. OK. It looks just like you want a tea house to look! Old fashioned things all over the like a piano, cash resister, globes, fireplace. Really nice.  I picked a black tea called Patisserie. Loved it. It tasted sweet and nutty and slightly spicy. It tasted and smelled terrific.  It comes with all the usual, sandwiches, scones, and sweets. The sandwiches I loved. Cucumber and cream cheese, smoked salmon on a round bread (shaped like a flower- cute), egg salad, and chicken salad.  The sandwiches were made on the freshest soft, pillowy, bread, like it was made that day. Loved it.  Scones were buttery and warm from the oven. We got two each. A lemon flavoured and cranberry one. They were served with clotted cream and a wonderful peach preserve. I think you can buy the peach at the cash.  The only problem I had was with the treats. Each tray was meant for two people. The sandwiches, and the scones were all doubled, even amounts for every one. The treats were not. There were four individual treats (other places give 4x2). Which meant you didn't get to try everything.  All on all it was really good. A bit pricy but not ridiculous. I will be back as a once in a while treat. Seriously check it out, you'll like it."}
