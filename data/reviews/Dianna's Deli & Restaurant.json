{"text":"This restaurant which has come under quite a bit of bad press recently now has a new owner. The place is much cleaner, has new booths and seating, nicer staff, and better food. This morning I had the crazy omelet which was filled with meat and fresh vegetables. Very large portion. Since the new owner I have come here more and more. Definitely stop in! Still a work in progress to freshen the place up but it's a good start!"}
{"text":"Dianna's is back!!!!!  The new owners have hired back many of the old staff and Jesse is back as chef.  The food is back to the great quality and serving size  we all remember.  Going back was like suddenly going back home, and yes, in this case you can go back and be warmly welcomed.  Food is top notch, service is friendly and you actually can leave with some change in your pocket.  The prices are not high but the food is great.  We have been back twice and will again make this our \"go to\" restaurant from now on.  And the place is now totally welcoming to everybody.  Go back and see for yourself, the old restaurant is back.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"My first dine at Dianna's was great. After having a few hours of sleep, I found myself here. It was quiet, spacious, and time-efficient. As a young black male, I felt comfortable here. It's a struggle finding places of comfort in the wake of today's social issues but Dianna's hospitality was a positive change. I order a three-stack of French tossed with almonds and two scrambled eggs with a hot chocolate and water to drink. The waitress was amazing and used phrases like: \"my sweetheart\" and \"my baby.\" I recommend dining here."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I ate in here, for reasons not related to the quality of the restaurant. Stopped in recently on a weekend afternoon for my favorite, the quesadilla. This is the diner version of a quesadilla, very mild, and I like it and have been getting it for years. I was happy to find it was still the same as it ever was and in fact the ingredients were better/fresher than I remembered, though it could have been served a little hotter. Since my waitress was otherwise polite and professional, I'll blame the delay on the people at the next table who had to ask her two dozen questions seemingly unrelated to a food allergy or medical diet before they just picked something. Fortunately they seemed happy with what they finally got.  I think they got new booths, other than that the place also looked the same. It was reasonably clean and the other afternoon diners were the usual mix of hipsters, families and retirees. The prices may have gone up a buck per plate since 2005 but it's not like everything is $15.95 now. I looked at the breakfast prices and most of the stuff was from 3 to 6 dollars, about what I expect from a diner.  My only minor complaint was that they only had 2 fountain sodas (the rest were in cans at a different price with no free refills) and no unsweetened iced tea. I did the healthy thing and drank water and hot coffee, which was good.   As Bob Seger said, still the same. Baby Babe you're still the same..."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, but the late-night menu is smaller than the daytime menu.  Similarly, they serve breakfast 24 hours a day, but the breakfast items you can order are limited the later it gets.  I've never had a bad breakfast here.  You can order an omelette with egg whites only if you please.  My favorite breakfast is the stuffed croissant -- a Western omelette croissant sandwich.  It comes with hash browns or fruit.  Generous portions of everything.    Certain lunch/dinner menu items are sketchy -- I wouldn't order a burrito if I were you, but the French dip sandwich is pretty good.  The banana cheesecake is also amazing.  Highly recommend.  Overall, not a bad joint to eat if you're hungry in the morning or the middle of the night.  Spice up a few of those sandwiches, and they might get 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The rueben was GREAT! Italian burger was good Matzo ball soup was ok  Overall, this was an good meal, portions were on point, price was right.  The locals must like it, because they had a steady flow the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"***BEWARE***   To all people who identify as lesbian, gay, queer, or transgender steer clear of this place.  If you and your friends are verbally accosted and abused by a homophobic customer while you're just sitting there with your friends drunk and eating your food and not bothering anyone, staff (specifically Chuck) of Dianna's Deli & Restaurant  will call the Lakewood Police have you and your friends ejected.   The offender? From my recent experience, he just gets to go home scot-free.  Echoing what Nancy M. and Swank S. wrote, when you're young, drunk, and don't know any better this place is maybe barely tolerable. The servers have always been nice, food is almost edible, and the decor is super dated as it is super cheesy and terrible.   But when you're fit-shaced and completely wasted who cares?  My friend has always suggested going there after the bars for years not because of the food or service but because he's always been amused by the late night sadness and tragedy of it all.  But there is no amount of laughing at drunks that will erase the rage and anger I felt from my friends and I being treated so badly by Dianna's Deli...especially by Chuck who should've known how to escalate/de-escalate much better.   (The Lakewood Police? Several customers and staff witnessed one of the cops pushing me very, very hard. I fell to the floor taking several chairs with me as I tried to stop my fall. Need I say more?)  Chuck? His sorry butt should be fired. I will never go back to Dianna's and if I could rate this place negative 5 stars I would. My Friend's has always been a much nicer place, is just around the corner, and glad to receive my patronage I'm sure."}
{"text":"I went to my first show at Dirty Diana's after a night hanging out with a group of friends in Tremont.  The entertainment that night was excellent.    The drag queen had obviously spent a lot of time getting dolled up.  The guy playing the tweeker part was talented and scratched the bejesus out of his neck/arm.  Seeing a texas sized afro was pretty sweet.  The final performance from the dude in the mesh shirt deserved a standing o.  Our waitress for the event was very accommodating although I've had better breakfast at a truck stop.  one star for the food three for service four for entertainment"}
{"text":"Went there today with my husband for late breakfast/lunch.  Service was horrible - I had asked the waitress about the french toast since they had two different kinds on the menu and then ordered blueberry pancakes.  Which totally threw her for a loop and I got a snotty comment from her about how we just talked about french toast so why didn't I order that.  Whatever.  Didn't get blueberry pancakes, and didn't feel like saying anything because by now I just want to get out of there - but they certainly charged me for the blueberry pancakes.  When we had the cashier change it because I didn't get what I ordered, he couldn't even say \"sorry about that.\"  My husband didn't get the sandwich he ordered either.  The rind on the lemon in his iced tea had a big black spot on it....hello, throw that piece away.  Needless to say, we learned a huge lesson today after wasting money on a meal there - George's kitchen all the way.  Why we didn't go there in the first place we'll never know......."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was 2 years ago. Usually on Sunday around 2-3pm it gets crowded because of people getting out of the clubs. The restaurant would, you would imagine, that they would have enough staff to deal with the flood of people. Wrong! Sitting here waiting for service would take over 30mins and waiting for coffee would end up waiting for another 30mins. It wasn't this bad 2 years ago but now this will be the last time we would ever eat here."}
{"text":"On Sunday March 20, 2016 I had the pleasure of traveling on the Westside of Cleveland Ohio to visit Dianna's Deli & Restaurant for our monthly 9am breakfast club.    I must say some drives are just well worth with and this is it although the reservations were made for approx 20 ppl only 10 showed up which was great.  Upon arriving our area was ready and waiting..... Maria was our server (the main one I think since she did have help sorry but I don't recall your names) and let me tell you she ROCKS.....everything was on point....she took the orders and that's all she wrote....the kitchen was turning out those breakfast orders left and right and the food came out HOT....definitely a bonus....I had the Royal Breakfast which was just right....steak, potatoes, silver dollar sized pancakes, eggs, and sausage.....we had a ball and I will definitely be back.....so if you live on the Westside you're probably already hip and if not go check em out....thanks for making our breakfast club a memorable one and living up to your motto: Dianna's Deli Good Food Good Friends."}
{"text":"great for a 3:30am breakfast after a long night. They have a patio, which was nice, i think our server was a little lazy, we had a group of 5 people and she just reached across ..waaaay across the table to give us menus and bring us our food. Guess she didn't find it necessary to \"serve\" us.. so she just placed all the plates next to her, and she just had us pass them down till everyone got their order. But the everything was really cheap that's why I settled on 3 stars. Service was 1 star (if that) but price was 5 stars and food quality was 4 stars (then again everything tastes good after you've been drinking all night and you're starving)."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss. I'm guessing they have different cooks frequently because my stir fry is always different. Sometimes a lot of sauce, sometimes barley any where it is almost just like rice, veggies and chicken. Service also depends on the waiter you get. There are a couple of good waiters here but you can definitely tell some of them hate their job and don't really care to service you."}
{"text":"Dropped in for take-out around 11 PM.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and home fries.  The sandwich was fine but I'm not sure about the home fries.  Same with my wife's french fries.  They didn't provide any cutlery and there wasn't any available at the motel at that hour.  Even at that hour (they're open 24 hours), they need to stay alert for these oversights."}
{"text":"I've always loved diannas good food comfortable environment and cheap as hell im on the way there now"}
{"text":"At here for the first time in a while and I was really impressed with the changes they made in the menu. I had the French onion soup which was on point, honestly it was the best French onion soup I've had in a while! Also the chicken salad was really good! I was impressed and our waitress was really nice and quick about getting our food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this establishment for years, I like the remodel taking place. But the problem is the quality of the food and preparation went down hill. Like the cook don't care how the food is prepared. Need to start looking for a new location."}
{"text":"all i have to say is if you like pooping your pants 10 mins. after you eat, go to dianna's.  hence the nickname \"dirty di's\""}
{"text":"Something happened and this place is clean, the foods good and it's cheap. I swore it off years ago, but went there because My Friends was too busy. It's way better than it used to be."}
{"text":"I had eaten in this place about 10 years ago and never went back.  My little Joe's Deli on Madison and 117th was closed due to a death in the family( AND IS CLOSING FOR GOOD COME NOVEMBER)  so I drove on looking for\"  food adventure\"  while trying to keep my money in Lakewood, I ventured over to El Jalapeno's...also closed for Cinco De Juli :0)  Just kidding, but it was closed. So I thought Ok, let's give Dianna's  place another chance.  BIG MISTAKE! if you actually LIKE food, LIKE good service, LIKE cleanliness DO NOT eat here...keep driving, probably to the Diner on Clifton, Geppetto's or Corky and Lenny's on Chagrin!   Dianna's was a food nightmare, like Jurassic Park for food!   First off the manager was an absolute, disorganized, disheveled joke. He looked like he was texting a fart joke to a buddy before he cared to acknowledge us. He finally put his phone down and grabbed our menus and then was searching a mostly empty restaurant to figure out where to sit TWO people.   The waitress was unhelpful, just totally uninterested in answering our simple menu questions. We ordered ice tea, made from a mix, but what was worse was she never bothered to refill it. the entire time. The place was about 1/3 full.  We looked over the menu and decided on our two meals and decided due to the hour to go with lunch. A. Chicken Ceaser salad  WITHOUT croutons and a shrimp alfredo that came with soup and salad.   My daughter  received her cup of minestrone meatball soup promptly. It was tasty, her salad showed up at the same time. I had nothing  After that we continued to sit there for nearly 45 minutes. I  still had nothing to eat. NO tea refills and NO acknowledgement that the food was coming or even that they were maybe understaffed that day...meanwhile  orders were going out to what I can only assume were a handful of Burly \"regulars\" . (They must be family members.)   I  was ready to complain when our food FINALLY showed up!   I ORDERED a Ceaser salad, what I GOT was a CHEF'S salad with over cooked, over salted, processed chicken thrown on top, an old egg that was sliced and had a GREY yolk, piled high with  the croutons I requested be left off and some faux-ceaser dressing.My daughter was just speechless. The teen is no snob, but she knows food AND she heard my order.    Her food was no better, poorly cooked pasta, mushy. The attempted cream sauce was an \"Epic Fail\" and the shrimp were cooked to a mush. despite appearing pretty at first..  It took me 7 minutes to get the \"manager's\" attention, I was standing there as he rang out 1 victim, sorry patron. I asked him to come look at the food we were served.   I TRIED NOT to blame the waitress,I know she didn't cook it but WHERE WAS A  REFILL!  Fortunately the owner was standing there. I showed her the food  and she made lots of apologies saying  \"it was SO unusual\".. I doubt that.  .I went to chef's school back in the 90's. I can eat in \" holes in the wall\" , street food, I can eat at LOLA,  The Russian Tea Room or Maxim's. All I ask is that the food ,no matter how simple or eleborate, is cooked properly and don't hand just any idiot a spatula. I think the dishwasher must have cooked that day.  I should have known better when I saw another family walk out (before we were dumb enough to walk IN ) and head to Wendy's across the street.  The only GOOD thing was, despite my still offering to pay for our tea and my daughter's food.  They comped the entire disaster and said please give them another chance....  NO WAY, NO HOW!  Back to Joes' Deli, George's and best breakfast at THE COFFEE POT!  I wound up with take away from Mark Pi's in Fairview!"}
{"text":"Mostly good every time I've gone. I tend to go with the chicken stir-fry when we eat here and it is usually very good. My last visit, however, was not good at all and dropped what would have originally been a 4 star rating down to a 3. We usually get the same waitress who does a fantastic job (I do not remember her name), but the last time we went, we had a different waitress, while she wasn't rude or anything, she had not come by our table until we were practically done with our meal. The place wasn't busy, so I'm not sure why she hadn't came by the table more than that one time, which never gave me a chance to tell her the order was wrong, so I had to pick out the things I had asked to be held from the order. I'll still come here in the future, but this last visit is going to make it a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Great portions!  Always have left overs to bring home.         I love t heir homemade rice pudding!  I never go home without some takeout!  Great prices as well.  Staff are great and food is served quickly!  Great customer service.  Open 24 hours!!!  Been going there for many years and have always been served a great meal!!!  Last time I got eggplant Parmesan and it was delicious!  I rarely eat Italian Food at s restaurant but this was great!!"}
{"text":"So I finally went inside after walking pass it for months.  Staff was not the best...kind of felt out of place, like I shouldn't be there, but whatever lol... so I saw that they had weekend specials and I ordered the eggs, home fries and toast.  As I was waiting for some odd reason I wanted to run out of the restaurant...the vibe was so uncomfortable.  It was kind of hard to rate but the food was good, it was just the energy from the staff that was not nice or comfortable at all...so basically 4 stars for the food...negative 22 stars for the staff."}
{"text":"Can anyone say breakfast!?    I love breakfast.  I especially love good breakfast that includes yummy things like pancakes, waffles, bacon (extra crispy), and good, hot, black coffee.  I know eggs are great for you, and sometimes...I want an egg.  Usually, I want the big plate o' carbs.!  On this particular Sunday, I was not in the mood for going to Dianna's.  I whined the whole way there, \"I don't want breakfast.  I'm not going to find anything good to eat there.  I don't want to go here.\"  My boyfriend is rolling his eyes and clenching his jaw like a good bf should.  We arrive, and I'm still whiney, but I turn it off 'cause I don't want our friends who suggested the place to see I'm not thrilled.  Amazingly enough, the coffee was drinkable.  Not that normal crap you get a diner.  And then whoa Nelly!  Who puts honey, cashews, and ice cream on a Belgium waffle?!?!  Dianna does!  And you know what?  She even put a banana on the waffle too for me, only because I asked so sweetly.  The anticipation grew as I watched huge plates of piping hot, sweet smelling, savory looking goodness walk by me.  I jumped every time a waitress walked near in hopes that my glutinous dish would arrive.  Oh and when it arrived, it arrived!  I moaned in ecstasy!  What goodness was filling my mouth of the sweet honey, the cream cold ice cream, the fluffy whipped cream, and yes the buttery syrup!  I almost forked my boy when he tried to take a bite.   The bacon, while not extra crispy, was just as bacon should be....good and greasy!  Let's just say Diana's let me get my eat on.    Check it out, your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"The place has gone downhill.  It is always busy but I can't understand why.  It may be because it is open 24 hours.  The place could be cleaner.  It used to be a better value.  The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This is a very late review, and is written only because I know a couple people who have either 1)spoken well about this place and in fact eat there regularly, or 2)asked my opinion about Dianna's breakfast compared to another, worlds apart in terms of quality, restaurant.   I've lived in Lakewood for over 2 years now, and in that time, have driven by Dianna's almost daily. I was first notified about the quality of food at this place by the restaurant itself, who had a large banner in front of their place notifying customers that Dianna's now had (this is not a direct quote) \"new lower food prices for the same quality food!\" If that is not an endorsement, I don't know what is.   My one friend who lives near me, frankly has unsophisticated taste. I'm not trying to be mean. That is just a hard fact. I don't attribute this to anything other than maybe a lack of traveling (aka worldliness). But I love my friend--he's a great man and a smart one at that. Maybe it's just naiveté, because he seems to love Dianna's.   The other friend and I went to Dianna's one time I think the weekend after we dined at Grumpy's for Sunday brunch. I don't know why I agreed to go to Dianna's that day because I already had suspicions about the food there. On that day, prior to dining at Dianna's I had not ever experienced their food. Only heard about it and read that sign in front of the building. I guess I was a little bit tired that day, and in a fit of fatigue, agreed to try it with friend #2. My suspicions were confirmed that morning. This place is bad. DO NOT GO HERE. The quality of the food is significantly less than sub-par. Mushy hash browns, bland coffee."}
{"text":"This is a 24 hour diner on the main drag (117th Street). Both the ambiance and the waitstaff are pleasant. Unfortunately, the food is poor. Both my wife & I had the Walleye Pike for lunch, assuming is to be a local specialty. Sadly, it was heavily encrusted with minimal amounts of actual fish between the crusts - a major negative! The mixed vegetables were overcooked to the point of approaching mush. The French fries were largish & limp. The mashed potatoes were okay. Proceed at your own risk!"}
{"text":"this was horrible. i have not been to dirty Dianna's since I moved back!!! don't go !!! go to my friends!!! food cold, you let the server know nothing... dont eat the food, tell the manager she says sit back down ill remake it... done at this point makes you pay for everything!!! granted i was fine paying for my to go food i have a microwave... lol but making someone pay for food they did not eat???  dirty is dirty for a reason... this is my first negative ever post... im a restaurant manager and hate this type of person post but very angry... just put this on my Instagram Facebook yelp twitter..  sould reach over 5689 people by tomorrow."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. I was very impressed with the food we had. The soup of the day was Cream of Mushroom. It was homemade and awesome! I would go back just for that soup.    The person I was with ordered from the senior menu and the portion of food was large.   Our food came very quickly. We were still eating our salads when it came.   For the price it was great. The only negative is the staff. The waitress was not very friendly and was a little rude."}
{"text":"I ... just.... where do you begin in this trifecta of evil?  1. THE WAIT STAFF HATES YOU. My friends are a cross section of college students and childless drunks, which means I've found myself at Dianna's too many times. First, I'm pretty sure there is only one waitress who works there. We've affectionately nicknamed her Top Knot because of the Dr. Seuss like three foot high bun atop her head. I've never met a woman who takes more pleasure in creating misery than her. Will you split up the check? NO. I'm allergic to this, can you make it without it? NO. Can I get a to go bag? NO. Will I see you again within the next 3 hours? NO. This isn't what I ordered. YES IT IS. (Yes that last one was a real example.) I have seen the Devil himself, and he likes scrunchies. Also, like other reviewers have said, it is not at all uncommon to witness screaming matches amongst the staff.  2. DEAR LORD THE OTHER DINERS. The last time I ventured to Dianna's was New Years Eve. I was the designated driver and every person in the car wanted to go out to eat. Despite the fact that I would have been willing to drive just about anywhere else in the midwest everyone insisted on staying local. Well, the selection of 24 hour joints open on New Years Eve in Lakewood is pretty slim. Sweet Christ, we ended up at Dianna's. I now know that one must never go to Dianna's past 3pm but at the time I was unaware. I was using the restroom when a drunken rhino in a Deb party dress began beating down the door and screaming, \"GET OUT! YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE FOREVER!\" I hadn't even turned around from locking the door yet. I also say beating down the door not to be colorful but because THE DOOR WAS ACTUALLY COMING OFF THE HINGES. I tried to ignore it, as best I could, and finished using the restroom and washing my hands, the irate failed genetic experiment beating on the door with her full body the entire time. I'm surprised the staff permitted that as it is right by the entrance and hostess station, the whole place could see her. When I left the bathroom I saw a scared hostess and also saw that the woman had actually cracked the door. That level of PCP intoxication is totally acceptable at Dianna's! I realize some of you may be reading this and think to yourself, \"Oh wow! This would be a great place for me and my hipster friends go on a Bukowski-esque people watching adventure at midnight when we are all half in the bag!\" NO. NO IT WON'T BE. It is more likely to depress you. Then you might get stabbed.   3. IS THIS EDIBLE? Well, no, not entirely. But you did pay for it so I guess you should eat it. I'm not sure how, even with a whopping three other people in the place, your food will still take an hour to arrive and be cold. They ask you how you would like it cooked but really that is just a rhetorical question. The answer is wet yet burned. I actually am a scientist (what with the college degrees and whatnot) and work in a lab. I can say from a scientific and mathematical stand point that this confuses the shit out of me. I expected Denny's quality initially, but no. No. I prayed for a week old Eggs Over My Hammy after eating here.   Please... Please... I beg of you, go anywhere else instead when you are drunk and already making a string of bad decisions. Any place that needs to put up a banner advertising the same food it always had for a much lower price (in a market of skyrocketing food costs) should be taken as a red flag. A big red flag. Jammed directly into your eye."}
{"text":"This past Thanksgiving I loaded my car with a small folding table, a folding chair, a tropical bouquet, a miniature bottle of chambord, and a carry out turkey dinner from Dianna's. I headed to Sunset Memorial Park where I poured the chambord on my partner's still too recent grave. I placed the flowers on his stone and set up the table and chair. This is not an attempt to be morose as I was exactly where I wanted to be eating a Thanksgiving dinner as good as was on any holiday table. Real roasted turkey with all the fixings.   Dianna's is open 24 hours a day and on holidays. It is my neighborhood go to place. I have been there with large groups, with just a few companions and by myself. No matter when or with whom it is welcoming. I have seen AA groups there after meetings, drag queens, grandmothers with their granddaughters, and all those who can be found in a city far more urbane than outsiders recognize.   Some things are good like the sandwiches or the rice pudding. Some things are very good like the daily specials serving soup, salad, main course and desert. Some things are not so good.   In reading the reviews for Dianna's I learned more about the writers than about the restaurant. As for me I will continue going there as will my friends."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was actually quite good, that is, for a 24-hour diner.  I liked this place.  It was significantly less smoky than \"My Friends\".  Compared to My Friends I think this place has better food and a better atmosphere, although not much better enough to keep me going here all the time.  Still, I slightly preferred Gold Coast as a 24-hour place...it has the most spacious atmosphere and the best desserts, and I think their food would tend to be better, although not universally.  The service here is better than at Gold Coast, however."}
{"text":"Opened a long time ago by a British Princess, but if she were still around today, she'd be upset that they mis-spelled her name and that, much like her own country (supposedly), the food here is not that great.  Personal Experience: I've only been to Dianna's twice, awhile ago. Both times is while I was on tour, and because it was one of the few 24 hr places in Cleveland. Both times I was underwhelmed by mediocre American diner food, and both times the servive was iffy. The worst thing was the prices though. It only keeps its three stars for being open 24 7.  I used to think Cleveland food was awful, but then I found Biagio's (opens 3am) in Willowick for Crulers, and Best Steak N Gyro on Euclid (I think) which is 24 hrs... both were great. Then I found about 50 better places to eat in CLE which I haven't reviewed yet, but none are open 24 hrs so Dianna's still gets a 3.  I now think Cleveland food is amazing, but not so much Dianna's.  High prices, mediocre food, never gonna get over a 3. Glad they are open 24 hrs though! 3/5"}
{"text":"I use to dine at Diana's for years but the food is horrible. Low grade to say the least. Ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was like rubber and the sauce was weak. Went again for breakfast about a week later. Eggs were greasy and sausage taste like cardboard. Restaurant was dirty but our waitress was very professional. She was the only good thing in the whole place. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"The food here is out of this world plenty of parking great service cakes are huge yummy yummy yummy"}
{"text":"I love food. I love going out to eat after drinking myself stupid. I like laughing at the drunk girl who has half a ruben sandwich stuck to her cheek.   I however do not like getting food poisoning. I get it every single time I eat here. I sit on the toilet cursing the bacon cheeseburger that my Grey Goose said would be a fantastic idea at 3 A.M. Then I become violently ill and curse some more.   I actually give drunken protests when friends suggest this place after the bar. Only if they are really friends though. Otherwise I let them learn the hard way.   My friends and I actually prefer to go to My Friends instead. It's right up the street, a hell of a lot cleaner, and the food is way better.   However if your idea of a kick ass hangover includes food poisoning, please, have a bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"We Russians (country of drunks and geniuses) have this  very truthful saying: \" There are no ugly women; there is just not enough vodka.\"  Well in Diana's case, there is not enough vodka in the world for me  even to tolerate this place.  Bad food, awful atmosphere, horrible service...If you are drunk you will sober up pretty soon from projectile vomiting. And no, it's not vodka. It's sausage links from Diana's.  Downside: oncoming trip to Emergency Room Up-side: Drag-queens' parade on Saturdays."}
{"text":"This little diner sits on the Lakewood side of W 117th and on the right side of price for breakfast. If I remember correctly, they have a breakfast special for $1.79 or something crazy like that. So the price is good. The food though was ok. I got the biscuits and sausage gravy. Their gravy was decent. it actually had pieces of sausage in it and it tasted like like gravy. The biscuit, though, was a different story. It was stale and was not the fluffy kind of biscuit often associated with the dish. It was the \"i made this at home and I don't know how to make fluffy biscuits\" kind. The egg was done as I had instructed so it was good. The coffee was sad. Real sad. I had to drink a double at Starbucks to make up for lost caffeine.  Worst experience was the wait time. There was only two other table when we walked in but it took like 15 minutes to bring out our food. I've worked in food services before and I know it does not take that long to bring out two plates of food. Especially a diner.  Thus, Diana earn the my first 2 star rating."}
{"text":"A-OK for under $10 a person. I'd recommend breakfast here, it's been good every time we've went (no food poisoning or the like as other's have noted).  Quality of the breakfast was good, and for the same price as McD's down the road, it's much better.  Service was friendly. Good cheap diner breakfast. Or you could pay $3 more for my friend's down the street, whatever..."}
{"text":"I went with a couple of friends for brunch and found it to be a decent diner.  We all had omelets which were tasty.  Service was friendly and prompt and food came out quickly.  The bacon was a little greasy for my taste but otherwise good and came out hot.  Coffee was typical diner coffee.  And they have free wifi and ample seating."}
{"text":"walked in with a group of 7 people and off the bat \"Diana\" I assume had an attitude. Then we order our food which was mediocre at best, a member of my party did not like their meal just wanted it returned and taken off the check. From that point on \"Diana\" or whoever looked like the boss lady had the audacity to come and sit right next to us and stare at us while we ate, STARE AT US! I've never felt so uncomfortable eating anywhere in my life. This was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a crappy diner or any place for that matter."}
{"text":"This place does exactly what it says on the outside;  it's a diner and it stays open 24 hours a day.  It's got diner food;  burgers, breakfast food, and sloppy sandwiches.  I'm not expecting a gourmet three-course meal when I come here.  I'm expecting to spend less than $20 for a plate of eggs, potatoes, and some sort of meat.  It's good, solid stuff that you could find in a dozen other cities.   It's fairly veg-friendly, as in, you're not going to get stuck eating just toast and eggs with no other options.    It's well-lit, like any good diner should be.  The night staff is especially nice, and while service can be slow at times (even when the restaurant is pretty empty), that's nothing to be upset over.  You've gone to an all-night diner;  if you want instantaneous service, there's a Wendy's and a Taco Bell on the same stretch."}
{"text":"My husband has been wanting to go here for some time now.  I was in the mood to eat out this past weekend and my husband thought it would be a good time to go especially since the Clifton Diner hasn't re-opened yet.  I have to say, from the outside this place does not look like anything special.  The parking lot didn't have to many spaces but we were able to find parking no problem.  When we entered the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised.  It looked clean, welcoming and had Christmas decorations throughout the restaurant.  We were seated almost immediately upon walking in.  I have to say they have a decent size menu with just enough options to not overwhelm you and I thought the prices were fair.    I ordered the stuffed croissant which is a toasted croissant stuffed with a Western omelet and I really liked it.  I had a bowl of fruit on the side instead of the hash and the fruit was fresh and delicious.  My husband had the sausage Benedict.  He said the hollandaise sauce was just \"ok\" but he ate it all.  To me, the benedict looked like a rather small to medium sized portion, but my husband seemed satisfied.  My son had the chocolate chip pancakes and said they were great.  I had a few bites myself and they were very good.  The only negative I would say is that our waitress checked on us a little to much, lol.  It's like every few minutes she had to stop by and ask if everything was ok or if we needed a coffee refill when it was obvious we didn't so that was a little annoying.  Also, i thought our food took a pretty long time to come out.  The food was warm although we would have preferred it be a little warmer.  Overall, it was a good experience.  Place was clean and the food was pretty good and it's not bad to pay under $30 for 3 people to eat.  We'd be back again."}
{"text":"In the category of 24 hour diners, Dianna's is superior to Denny's.  Don't vary to far from the DTS (Diner Trinity of Safety,copyleft, Jim W):  Burger's, BLT's and Breakfast Food.  Overall, a passable and basic place to eat but that's it.  Don't go looking for great service, sparkling cleanliness or delicious and wonderfully fresh food at Dianna's.  You won't find it.  2.5 stars on a good day, 2 at 4 am on a Friday night rolling into Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on with Dianna's. I'll admit to going infrequently, but the food in the past was more homemade. Now, most of what I've gotten there tastes like GFS, Sysco etc., in other words, nothing special. Last time I got the stuffed pork chop dinner. The chops seemed definitely pre-packaged heat ups and the mashed potatoes were watery and tasteless. I had chicken noodle soup which also tasted canned. I make praise-worthy chicken soup, so I know if theirs is homemade, someone ain't home-making it right. Last few times we've been during the day it's been deserted with maybe only one other diner. Maybe there's a reason for that?"}
{"text":"Whodini said it best: The freaks come out at night. I have never and will never set foot in Dianna's when the sun is in the sky. This is only a night time option and a decision often fueled by alcohol. I much prefer My Friends Deli and Restaurant. Some friends like to come here late night. Friday and Saturday night at Dianna's at around 3 a.m. is some of the best people watching in Cleveland. It is also pretty sad."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  Whenever I come to Lakewood I come here.  Staff was nice, a little slow.   Limited menu and the atmosphere felt like a morgue.  The changes they made hurt this place."}
{"text":"The food is simple, yet very good.  A little bland, but salt and pepper helps.  I would recommend giving it a try.  You get a lot of food for your money."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE food. Pretty much a dollar TV dinner I can't believe they even serve this to people. Your Better off going to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! They had it decorated for Christmas, it was beautiful! My coffee cup was always full and the food tasted great. I got the Mexicali omelette. My waitress was so funny and she was friendly as could be. A few other waitresses also came by to check on me. Such a cozy atmosphere and I will definitely be going back! If I had any negative thing to say, their to-go containers are very low budget. The tab is so flimsy it won't stay closed."}
{"text":"It's a so-so diner. I've ate here a couple dozen times   It's a 24/7 for different meals (breakfast, dinner, late night). They used to have a great selection of desserts. The food selection is not the best but it's the location and being open 24 hours a day. It's def a late night after the bars for food."}
{"text":"Veggies were cold and pork chops under cooked, told waitress and she said she would go heat it up.....I told her I didn't want a microwaved meal so I just won't get anything and could I just have it taken off my bill, I was told that couldn't happen and then later after the manager and waitress talked it was take . Terrible food and even worse customer service"}
{"text":"A great local diner serving up old fashioned hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner 24/7! Although, I've only been here for breakfast...once before a Browns game and once before Comic Con, the service and food was great every time.  It's also dirt cheap!  My favorite is actually Diana's Favorite and it's only $6.95!  It comes with a pepper, onion, and home fries skillet covered in melted cheese with your choice of egg on top, 2 sausage patties, 3 mini pancakes, and toast. (See the pics)  Very tasty and filling.  Their coffee is pretty good.  It looks like they have a nice dessert case too. The servers are quick and attentive and one of the girls is pretty cute. ;-)  The inside is pretty plain jane, diner decor...nothing to write home about.  Check out Diana's for some late night or early morning grub!"}
{"text":"This is a great greasy spoon, especially after a long night of drinking!! Just watch out for the mean drunks but otherwise the food is cheap & good!!"}
