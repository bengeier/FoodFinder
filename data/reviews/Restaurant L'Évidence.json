{"text":"Je fais toujours mes réunions d'affaires à cet endroit. Calme et surtout pas cher du tout!! La nourriture est délicieuse, rien à redire."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning, not busy at all. You would expect quick service, but nope, we're in Montreal. We didn't venture into new territory with our choice, going for the 2 eggs and french toast and the 2 eggs combo with pancakes. 

Nothing extraordinary, just regular breakfast fare. If youre looking for something exciting, check out L'Avenue.

Also, if you search for L'Evidence on restomontreal there's a coupon for 12% off. We forgot to mention it to the server but take the opportunity to save some money =)"}
{"text":"Food: A big selection of different breakfast items. Food was ok, nothing extraordinary, your typical brunch food. But thumbs up for the generous side of fruits, love it!

Service: Have seating for large groups but service is very slow. 

Value: You get what you pay for.

Ambiance: Big wall mirrors which are fun and add a little eccentricity. Beware the lighting is very very bright."}
{"text":"Came here today for some Sunday brunch. Ordered a spinach omelette with goat cheese. 
 

Pros

 - Omelette was terrific! Lots of goat cheese which always makes me happy.
 - You sort of got what you expect from a typical brunch.
 - Can't really complain about the price.

Cons

 - Felt like it was feeding time at the nursing home
 - Server was totally uninterested 
 - I really do hate it when restaurants don't pay attention to coffee levels. I shouldn't have to ask twice for coffee before giving up and attacking my friends cup. 
 - Bring your sunglasses! Lighting over kill
 - The walls of mirrors could use some windex."}
{"text":"Petit resto sympa à prix abordables! Les salades sont gigantesques et le tartare de buf très bon! Le service est bon et sympathique! Je n'y suis jamais allée pour le brunch mais à être passée devant, il semble qu'une réservation est inévitable!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Friendly service, affordable prices, and the food was amazing. My wife and I went for breakfast, I had, \"the special,\" and she had the Eggs Benedict. All the breakfasts come with coffee, fruit, and toast. Which is an awesome touch.  My food was delicious and they even were nice enough to allow my wife to make substitutions on her Benedict. Definitely a new regular."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow here, but if you're not in a rush, then perhaps this is the place for you.

The food was really terrific-- we had a wonderfully prepared veal dish, and the prices were very reasonable.  Just make sure to be aggressive about flagging down the waiter!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome breakfast and very nice and professional staff! Heaps of great breakfast fruits and toasts and eggs. We invaded the place two mornings in a row with a large group of rowdy roller girls and they were super accomodating about it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been 2-3 times to this restaurant for brunch. It is a nice alternative to l'avenue or other restaurant on Mont Royal. The food is good and fresh. Their basic breakfast is a good value (2 eggs, meat, potatoes, fruit, coffee for 6$ ish). I have not tried their other breakfast, but everything I saw around me looked good. The coffee is fresh and good. The waitresses can be busy at time and you may have to wait for coffee refills, but overall, the service is pretty good. They have menus in English and French. The place is pretty big, so there is usually a relatively small or absent waiting line, even on Saturday or Sunday morning/brunch time. It is good for small groups, children, couples, etc..."}
{"text":"Grymt trevligt stället och god & fräsch mat! Tog eggs with 3 meat och drack Sangria till brunch. Lite torr scrambled eggs men gott ändå. Bagels såg riktigt bra ut men testade inte. Pommes frites var inte bra."}
{"text":"What a warm, sunny day we had last week so a must to sit outdoors on the terrace and soak it in. I really enjoy l'Evidence for it's cute location above Sherbrooke, generous breakfast menu and impressive value. I had the two eggs & two small blueberry pancakes, which comes with whole wheat toast, home fries (always a fave), abundant fresh fruit, real maple syrup and bottomless coffee. What a deal at 8$! My Mom enjoyed the Eggs Benedict and agreed they were poached to perfection.

We got there at 11am on a Wednesday, but given the gorgeous weather we had in mid-March, we weren't the only ones who thought it was a fab idea to hit the patio. Service was quick & efficient, coffee was topped up without having to ask and food was quite satisfying. This restaurant doesn't disappoint for bfast

Only downside was that some joker decided to light up at the adjacent table. Actually, doesn't really matter where he was because it's a small terrace and well, smoke carries (and lingers) just about anywhere. Come on, the restaurant can't disallow smoking in this tiny area? I thought it was a by-law by now. Maybe it's not the restaurant's fault (actually, yeah it is) that they don't have a \"No Smoking\" sign but I hope it will become a smoke-free venue soon enough. Smokers don't realize the effect their cigs have on the rest of us trying to enjoy our food? Shame on him

Apart from that incident it was a lovely breakfast on the Plateau and worth a visit. All three of us very much enjoyed our meal and will be back!"}
{"text":"Good value for breakfast 

The hollandaise for the Benny was mediocre but the fruit salad was fantastic and totally compensated. Coffee included. Great option for a simple brunch."}
{"text":"All right, so this place is pretty sweet with its terrasse out front and glorious brunch menu. HOWEVER, (isn't there always a \"But\" disguised as \"However?\") the service was, I hate to say, poor at best. I arrived after a 30 minute bicycle ride to meet my breakfast posse, and not only was I sweating, I was also starving. Time ticked on...tick tock...forty-five minutes later our server brought us some waters and menus...and this was only after I had tracked down another server to inquire as to who would be hitting up our table. This is uncool in my books. Perhaps I was just feeling like an infant because I was hungry, and perhaps the service is normally pretty stellar. I really can't say, but what I CAN say is that the food was great when it finally arrived and we didn't feel like we were being hurried along at any point. This is key considering the place was jam packed with other brunch champions. I suppose I'll return to L'evidence at some point for round 2 in the hopes that we won't have to wait ages for attention...after all, who likes waiting for attention? I'll tell you - NO ONE!"}
{"text":"We stumbled in here after our intended destination was unexpectedly closed, and were very happy with what we ended up with, food-wise. I did think the service was slow, and the roasted potatoes I had were not cooked entirely through, which was kind of a downer. But overall, their brunch food is very good (just maybe get fries instead; they'll cook through more quickly!). The fruit section of my plate in particular was ripe and tasty. There are a lot of good options along this bit of Saint-Denis, but this was definitely cost-effective (I think my omelet plate was well under 10 dollars CAD), and good enough as the beginning of a solid day out and about in Montreal. There's a lovely back dining room if you don't want to be outdoors, and the staff, if a bit slow, are quite friendly. If it isn't too crowded, you would do well to stop here. I do think there are better places up and down the block, but this is a far from bad option."}
{"text":"Pour faire changement, je me suis rendue dans ce restaurant juste en face de mon spot habituel La terrasse est toujours pleine depuis quelques semaines, ça a attiré mon oeil de yelpeuse. J'ai regretté.

Le menu était similaire a celui d'ou je vais d'ordinaire, mais ce qui se retrouve dans mon assiette n'est pas tout a fait a la hauteur de mes attentes. Le service était bien, mais pas assez ... Il a fallu se lever pour aller payer car ça faisait au moins 15 minutes que nous attendions, et le restaurant était quasi-vide. 

Un bon dépanneur pas trop cher ( une facture de 30$ pour 2 personnes sur l'heure du lunch )"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I had in Montreal. A block away from where we stayed on St Denis. Their outdoor patio is great for people watching. Ordered my beloved Montreal bagel on a poached egg. My dish came with a generous side of fresh fruit, including a banana, watermelon. Their orange juice was freshly squeezed. Delicious! Get the large rather than the small. Their grapefruit juice was equally good. Homefries were decent but not the main event. 

Compared to everything else on St-Denis, their prices were pretty decent.

Note: Paying is at the counter."}
{"text":"On a recent weekend trip to Montreal, we chanced on this restaurant as we searched for breakfast on a Saturday.  The food was so good that we returned the next morning.

The food is FRESH, delicious, and abundant.  Each breakfast comes with almost a pound of fresh fruit (grapes, grapefruit, oranges, papaya slices, watermelon, banana and strawberry).  I had the bagel and lox: a delicious Montreal-style bagel (way better than the bready monstrosities we call bagels in the USA) topped by a generous portion of smoked salmon. The French toast (pain doré) was great, as were the pancakes - real maple syrup.  The juices are all fresh-squeezed and the service was friendly.  GREAT DEAL and GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"Called ahead to make a reservation for a group of friends, but they don't make reservations. They said that if we could show up  around 12 noon we can get a table. So we showed up around 12 noon and it turns out that the only table that could accommodate us was reserved."}
{"text":"We happened upon L'evidence from a referral from the pizza/Italian place down the block (he wasn't open yet, so he sent us here). We were walking in one of the worst snow storms Montreal has seen since 1971. (12/27/12). We had a really great lunch/brunch. My kids were thrilled with the steamed hot chocolate. I had a crepe wth spinich, goat cheese and brie. My husband ordered the eggs benedict and was very happy with the size and taste of his meal. We had really great service (we were one of the few parties in the restaurant due to the weather). We were visiting from Detroit and found our experience to be very \"Montreal\". We had a great meal with a very warm and inviting environment."}
{"text":"Cosy et une carte est gigantesque pour des prix raisonnables ! C'est surtout un nice endroit pour prendre un vrai brunch authentique (oeufs, sausisses, café, fruits).. notamment l'été sur la petite terrasse à l'ombre avec vue sur le Carré Saint Louis.

Je recommande !"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here whenever I am in Montreal. All there bennedict plates have a massive fruit sculpture on your plate. Delicious. Their fresh squeezed OJ is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Lots of variety on menu. Slow service but very kind and polite. Moules marinieres were too salty. Baked beans were sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"Small patio but possibly the best mimosas and eggs Benny I've had. The sides of fruit that came with our meals were high quality and portion sizes were generous. Service was so-so, the only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5/5."}
{"text":"On nous en avait dit beaucoup de bien...on s'attendait à mieux!
On y a été un dimanche midi pour le brunch...pensez à réserver !! Nous on a eu de la chance une table s'est libérée rapidement :) 
On a tous pris des ufs bénédictines. Le repas était bon, rien d'extraordinaire.
Par contre nous avons du demander nos cafés (inclus avec le plat) qui jamais ne nous ont été proposé. Et dans l'assiette de mon amie il manquait plusieurs fruits qui ne lui ont pas été servi.
En conclusion:sans grand intérêt mais cela reste un bon brunch."}
{"text":"It was unseasonably warm the afternoon I visited L`Évidence in November 2009 and their outside seating is absolutely the perfect place to people watch in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal.  I'm often a solo diner on my business trips, and I felt very welcomed by the waitstaff here.  I enjoyed a pint of Les Brasseurs Belle Gueule (on special) and the veggie baguette with side salad and fries.  Everything was quite delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love this place! I adore eggs benedict and not only do they do several awesome eggs benedict here, they serve them with a veritable sculpture of fruits. I loved this place so much, I went here two days in a row during my stay in Montreal. The first time I ordered the La Complete, which was a generous portion of eggs benedict that included ham, Swiss cheese and portobello mushrooms. Awesome. The second time I ordered the L'Evidente, which was an eggs benedict featuring  ham, artichokes and blue cheese. So delicious! If you love eggs benedict, you will love this place. 

The sculpture of fruit is a great way to finish out your meal. The fruit I was served included large portions of orange, banana, watermelon, mango, etc. All the eggs benedicts also came with homefries, which were decent, but nothing special. The cafe au lait is also fantastic. They have a small terrase outside. Service was a little slow, but fine if you want to linger over your meal. 

The only drawback here is the bathrooms which do not match the nice decor of the terrase, the bar, and the restaurant proper. 5 stars for the food and the restaurant atmosphere, but they lose a star for bathrooms. The stalls were constructed out of wood panelling and generic, hardware store style locks and featured ads from the 80s or early 90s. 

Go, eat the eggs benedict, enjoy the terrase, but skip the bathrooms."}
{"text":"This is probably one of those restaurants where the quality of meal really depends on your luck. The first time I came here, the food was incredibly slow but worthwhile in the end. The eggs came out just shy of perfect. The second time we waited well past half an hour, and the meal was mediocre at best. The eggs were overcooked, the and the Hollandaise sauce a cooling puddle of gel coagulating over the food. One thing is quite certain: be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Ce petit restaurant est charmant et bien situé. Le menu offre un vaste choix de déjeuners, de menus du jour et du soir et de boissons alcoolisées. L'ambiance est très agréable et les prix sont raisonnables. J'y suis allée en soirée avec un groupe de conversation en espagnol d'une vingtaine de personnes et il y avait assez de place. Cependant, le service pour la nourriture était peu rapide et plusieurs gens avaient fini de manger avant que d'autres membres du groupe aient reçus leurs assiettes. Il est plus facile de venir en transport en commun étant donné que les places de stationnement sont rares et  vous coûteront aussi chers que votre entrée."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about their mussels and fries special.  I'm serious, it was perfect.  I was starving, I love mussels, I love fries, I love mayo and I love a glass of white wine.  A-MAZ-ING!

Their brunch looked money so I'd recommend trying that.  The fruit looked fresh, juicy and colorful!

I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Satuday - service was good, and had a great pitcher of sangria.  Had the croque monsieur ... not that great, at least compared to what you get in France.  They gave me a steak knife with it, because the bread was incredibly hard to cut through.  My friend had an avocado-grilled shrimp salad which was nice."}
{"text":"Wow!
My wife and I visited l'evidence after asking a friend to surprise us with her restaurant choice.  

I ordered eggs benedict with smoked salmon & capers.  It arrived with a mountain of fresh fruit and it tasted delicious.  I will go back to this restaurant for sure.

The atmosphere was friendly, and the waiters accommodated our beastly stroller with delight.  Service was fast too!"}
{"text":"Nourriture correcte (petit déjeuner), quoique tiède. Fruits d'accompagnement insipides, alors que nous sommes en saison. Les fraises du Québec sont là, ainsi que d'autres petits fruits. Pourquoi nous donner du melon importé à peine mûri? On se demande toutefois si les assiettes sont trop grandes ou si les portions sont petites? Je ne peux être trop sévère, j'y retournerai pour le dîner, en soirée. Par ailleurs, quoique le service soit efficace et qu'il n'y ait rien à redire sur la politesse des hôtes, je ne crois pas que ce soit utile que les employés règlent leurs conflits devant la clientèle."}
{"text":"Le service pour le déjeuner était très long. Je ne pense pas y retourner. 3 serveuses pour même pas 10 clients et elles étaient débordées. Les oeufs et les pancakes étaient bien présentés mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Une très bonne adresse pour les brunch à Montréal. Service rapide, un grand choix de plats variés, une petite terrasse intime et très agréable quand viennent les beaux jours... bref un petit bonheur ! Les brunchs ne sont pas servis tard mais ils valent la peine de se réveiller vers midi ! Des assiettes bien garnies, aux saveurs mélangées et toujours un peu de fruits afin de terminer en beauté... 

A great spot for brunch time in Montreal. Fast service, a lot of choices for a various menu. A little and intimate terrace perfect while summer is coming. This is a real crush ! For the brunch the best is to to go early (I mean before 2pm). Meals are huge and delicious, and, of course, with fruits !"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a lazy Saturday morning. The L'arc en Ciel eggs benedict with smoked salmon is amazing. Service is a little slow but overall its pretty good.

Remember that you have to pay at the counter...we didn't realize that. ooops"}
