{"text":"This is a very wonderful place in Charlotte. If you have kids here, they will not only learn martial arts, but also moral skills and good character. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, including Sifu Eric and Debra. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to learn martial arts."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my happy place. The staff and students at the Peaceful Dragon are friendly, supportive, and non-judgmental. They come in all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels, encourage you to excel and do your best, but don't pressure you to exceed your limitations. While progress and improvement may not occur overnight, better focus, calmer attitude, increased strength and flexibility sneak up on you with regular attendance.  I've never regretted my decision to join. Come and sample all that the Peaceful Dragon has to offer."}
{"text":"We searched around for a good martial arts school. Having heard so many positive reviews about Peaceful Dragon, we enrolled our son here. Right from the orientation class with Sifu, we could see  the knowledge of all the instructors here. My son eagerly waits for his class days. We would love for him to progress all the way upto the black sash. Many thanks to Sifu, master George and all the instructors."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible. Unless you owe money, nobody even speaks to you. The only thing the lady at the front has ever said to me is \"You pay today?\"   My schedule changed at work which prevented me from going to class. After reaching out for over a month, they finally told me it didn't matter whether I could come or not, I still had to pay. Guess I should quit my job and just train. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Charlotte's only Chang-style Tai Chi Chu'an and Kung Fu school offers programs for children and adults, including Yoga, Meditation, and the Zen Weight Loss Boot Camp. I've been attending for a year and a half and have seen tremendous improvement in my balance, stress levels, focus, and general well-being. The instructors at The Peaceful Dragon have to complete a ten-year training period before teaching others... this is NOT your fly-by-night strip mall martial arts school, but they make Tai Chi and Kung Fu accessible to all ages and abilities."}
{"text":"I've been going to The Peaceful Dragon for about three years and it is the perfect combination of exercise and meditation for me. I'm calmer and more stable as a result."}
{"text":"We are at the Peaceful Dragon 4-5 times per week for Kung Fu, Tai Chi, and seminars on Chinese medicine and philosophy.    Our 10 year old has been going for 5 years and is now working towards his junior black sash.  Our 7 year-old just started, and wants to take classes every time they are offered.  Both are members of the Leadership Club and are currently reading \"The West Point Way of Leadership\" as part of their training.  I have been taking Tai Chi and Kung Fu for a year now, and have lost 20 pounds, plus have gained much greater strength, stamina, flexibility, and confidence.  Classes are more than what you might pay at a strip-mall martial arts school, but you are getting a richer, more vibrant community and a more robust training."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars only because the teachers are great if you are an experienced yoga student. If you are not, save your money as this place has no classes for beginers or even intermediate students. They will gladly take your money ($197 a month) and they want you to allow them auto withdrawals from your bank account. The man that ownes it named Eric (but he prefers to be called \"Sifu\"), is clearly interested in your money and not your progress or happiness as a student.Their karate classes for kids seem to be quite popular, but there are dozens of good yoga studios in South Charlotte where you don't have to sign a 1 year contract"}
{"text":"Another place on my \"why I moved to Charlotte\" list, and my first retroactive 5 star review.  Brunch here on Saturdays back in aught-three was amazing. French pressed black grounds of shockingly dark coffee for cheap - before CLT knew anything other than Dilworth and Starbucks. Vegan sausage, homemade. Farro for brekkie, before it was Batalified. It was a long, long drive but 100% worth it, and a lot of the time, you had to wait, so I guess we weren't the only ones that didn't care.  Alas, by time my toukas made it to crown town, they'd put the kybosh on nosh and focus now on martial arts classes, etc. Used to be, post face-stuffing, you'd catch the end of the Kiddie class through the huge windows, and feel kinda guilty that the only reason you ever came was for food. Not that guilty, tho.   I miss you, PDBr."}
{"text":"I've been taking classes at the school for 14 years. Excellent teachers, excellent students, traditional lessons. No \"montage\" training. You have to put your time in and make an effort in order to achieve your goals. Students have become teachers and opened their own schools after 10 years. Descended from the Shaolin temple and the next Abbot in line to the temple, Shi Guolin, has seminars once every other year if available to learn direct Kung Fu. The classes and styles offered are Traditional Kung Fu, Taichi, Excellent Yoga, Martial weapons. 14 Years ago when I started looking around researching other styles, I heard so many people talking about their children and their kids getting \"black belts\" in under a year with no prior training. I thought that was absurd, then I learned about \"pay to test belt levels\" and the scams run at many schools. Here, you don't even get a black belt until after Ten years because you have SO much to learn, AND you keep learning after that. I here so many people complain about the costs, which truly are not that bad, I'm on a fixed income being disabled and I can coming five days or nights a week. You truly get what you pay for. Would you pay 40 bucks for a BMW? How long do you think it would last? Then if your mind, body, spirit, and overall physical and mental health is important to you, the cost is minuscule."}
