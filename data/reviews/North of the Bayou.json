{"text":"Love, love, love! And did I say love it? Great food from the people that brought us The Bayou.  Jambalaya and red beans and rice were great as was the Gater po'boy. Our server Tory was awesome - can't wait to return and try the pasta and crab chowder. Best Cajun food and at a reasonable price since we left the French Quarter in New Orleans!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Thursday night. We had to wait a while to be seated even though there were open tables. Once seated service was pretty good. The food was decent. I had the crab cakes and my husband had the wings. Our only real issue was the smell in the restaurant. There was a very strong scent of something kind of minty, or eucalyptus or something. It was overpowering and you couldn't smell food at all. It was very distracting from the taste of the food and really made the experience more unpleasant than it would have been otherwise. I think it's kind of basic Restaurant 101 that you want to smell the food a restaurant is making when you go somewhere, not something else. We were told the smell was from an organic cleaner the owner makes and uses. I would give this place one more shot, but if they don't stop using the cleaner or eliminate the smell I would not continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The people are super nice.  Can't wait to go back.  Had the etouffe and gumbo and fried oysters."}
{"text":"Great place! I love the staff; always friendly and inviting. The food is great, I especially like the etouffee (good n' Spicy), po boys (bread is fantastic), gumbo (my favorite), and raw oysters (fresh and delicious). I am so happy they came to the neighborhood. My husband and I use to go to the Bayou downtown and it was always a drag to go all the way down there for some good NOLA food. Now we don't have to! I am not sure what some other reviews are talking about, the only reason, I can imagine, that someone had a bad experience is maybe because they went during opening weekend and expected everything to run as smooth as a restaurant that has been open for months. I, myself can be more forgiving considering this place has the best gumbo in town and delicious drinks to boot; and as someone who has been to New Orleans, I know the difference. The only criticism I have is in regards to the wings. I am not a big fan of battered wings and the old Bayou had much better wings than what they are currently serving. However, some people prefer their hot wings to be battered rather than not, so I can't hold it against them. Keep up the good work North of the Bayou! Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and tried quite a few different things on the menu and everything has been very good! Friendly-ish service."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the food here is not good.  I visited the Bayou a couple of times when they first opened uptown and really enjoyed it, but the quality of the food has gone way down.  I went for restaurant week, which is usually a good way to try something new.  I was with another person and between the both of us we had; gator gumbo, fried calamari, the gumbo was extremely spicy and the calamari was just OK.  We then had stuffed chicken breast and crab enchiladas.  Interesting enough, they both had the same sauce on the bottom of the plate, the sauce was so spicy for me that I could not enjoy the enchiladas.  Not much other flavoring besides the too spicy sauce.  Dessert we had sweet potato bread pudding and creme brulee, the bread pudding was not good at all, could not even finish it.  The creme brulee was the best part of the meal.  For drinks we had a rum runner, never had a frozen version before and could not taste the alcohol."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, gorgeous out so we sat outside. The waitresses were so confused it became a cluster. Ours forgot plates, silverware, and would disappear. A waitress for the table next to us didn't bring napkins, had a wrong order, and then lost their bill. Meanwhile at the same table a kid brought out the food and spilt the soup and drink on them. We had the Mahi Mahi with andouille crust and it was good but would be better out of the soup with a rice or noodle got side. We shared the jambalaya chimichanga. The sauce was so overbearing it took away any flavor from the inside of the shell. We added shrimp thinking it would be inside. Instead the added like 5 shrimp and plumped them in the same heavy sauce and they were luke-warm at best. We thought they would have been inside the chimichanga. May go back to try something else but perhaps sitting inside is the ticket"}
{"text":"We came here for my boyfriends birthday. Him and his family were pretty bummed that the original Bayou closed and after hearing such wonderful things, I felt like I missed out on a Madison gem. However, when I told them they reopened at a new location, they were ecstatic. They talked it up so much I was very excited to see what was in store for me. Reading some of the other reviews for this place, made us all weary about coming here, but we still decided to go and man was I not disappointed. We started with the sweet potato fries and cheese curds. The cheese curds were spicy and savory, they took a Wi classic and put a flavorful cajun spin on it. The sweet potato fries were also very delicious. They were super crispy, as if they had some type of breading on them. For our entree's most of us had the Étouffée, and it came with a mound of rice, and buttery, lightly toasted french bread. The étouffée was creamy, full of flavor, and had a nice kick to it. I would have loved to try some beignets, but we were just too full. The dining experience was brought together perfectly with helpful staff. Our waitress was knowledgable, quick and helpful. I will definitely be back here. Very laid back place with some quality Cajun Cuisine."}
{"text":"The restaurant didn't not have the ambiance I hoped for.  The staff was nice enough and knowledgeable and very accommodating. I ordered the blackened catfish with a side of gumbo. It was phenomenal!  Seasoned very well and the presentation wasn't too shabby either. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went there for Mardi Gras and arrived fairly early to find the place almost empty. There were some people in the bar area but we wanted to be more comfortable eating dinner.
The waitress wouldn't seat us at the booth/table combo for four we wanted because we were only two.
We didn't stay long and she eventually seated a father and son in the spot we'd asked for. 
They didn't have shrimp on its own which is why my cousin suggested it in the first place. I wanted the oyster Po' Boy I'd seen on the menu but they had a special one for Mardi Gras and it was $17 for six grilled oysters so I essentially got two apps. Maybe six oysters are considered a meal?
So neither of us got what we wanted and I found the red beans and rice surprisingly bland with a few pieces of sausage that might as well have been left out. The waitress did give us a break on that and brought us the lunch red beans and rice as a side but we couldn't eat them between the two of us, nothing tasted very good.
 I'd also gotten the gravy fries which I liked at first because I was hungry. The gravy needed to taste less like Thanksgiving and more like Mardi Gras. It would have helped a little if the fries were better seasoned and a lot if they'd been crispy.
My cousin's Shrimp Po' Boy didn't look tempting and the shrimp was heavily breaded. She ate it but wasn't crazy about the sandwich and thought her Hurricane was way too sweet with no punch.
We went to the Echo after that and the sandwiches looked better and bigger, the people were friendly and the service was great. The Echocane I had was very good and pretty potent. 
The bar was packed when we left North of the Bayou and I've heard other people say they've had fun in the bar. It seems as if this place would fair better without the restaurant and I can only guess it will eventually fold like the others before them.
A final note, North of the Bayou is not handicap friendly and the long, steep walk up to the door should be avoided by seniors and those with difficulty walking."}
{"text":"Not good. It would be great if a restaurant could serve decent food at this location. I got the jambalaya. It was total mush, had no flavor, and tasted days old. Two stars simply because the building isn't vacant anymore."}
{"text":"I went in to this place with high hopes because it can with strong recommendations from people I know in the area and was highly disappointed. I don't think I e ever given a one star review but for sanitary reasons, I believe it was warranted. I'm not going to get in to food because it's not important in a restaurant that fails to meet basic hygiene standards. Service was okay, forgivable mistakes at first. After ordering, our waiter came to check on us. I asked for a refill of water. A short time later, our main dishes were served. I asked about the oysters we'd ordered for an appetizer and was told he'd check and I again, advised I would like some more water. He returned a short while later and stated they were out of oysters. No biggie. I again, stated I would like some more water. He returned later with a new glass of water. Thank you. Upon drinking half a glass of water, I noticed a very questionable hair on the outside of my water glass, curly, short with hair follicle still in tact. Absolutely disgusting. Not sure if it was a complete mistake or if the waiter did it on purpose because I had to ask for more water three times. Either way, completely unacceptable. I was not rude to the waiter, I work in the service industry and I forget things ALL THE TIME. So for that reason alone, North of the Bayou gets one star from me."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but the po boy looked so cheap- crappy pickles and fixings. The jambalaya was okay, but didn't have much of a kick and was a little dry. My real annoyance was at the creme brûlée- it had a gummy, sticky crust that wasn't \"crack it with a spoon\" hard. It was just not worth the $5 paid. Small and sticky with none of that satisfying crunch."}
{"text":"First impressions this is one of the worst Cajun places I have ever been to.  Drinks: a Pimm Cup with celery?  Awful! The rum runner I have never had a frozen version before.  The food was gross, overcooked and under cooked on the same plate?  It happened with poor seasoning and bad preparation.  

I would give it 0 stars but that is not an option."}
{"text":"Often not impressed with Restaurant Week offerings but here portions were good, food was done well, staff was excellent.  Glad we decided to try it out!  Definitely worth another excursion in the future.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food terrible but we had reservations for a 60th birthday party and were treated with the most terrible customer service I have ever received in 59 years by the manager Mya. She was rude, disrespectful, unhelpful and overall a very  unhappy and angry person. None of the 22 of us who attended the gathering will ever return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and good service. They need to update their prices from their website. Last time I checked he very expensive prices for dinner but when i went there for dinner they also has smaller portions for a lesser price great for me because I needed a smaller portion. Try it you won't be disappointed!! My husband loves it too. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The food is just as amazing as it was at the Bayou downtown. We got the beer cheese sausage soup which was deliciously rich and the jambalaya was fantastic as always! The service was very speedy and polite. Definitely have to make the trek back!"}
{"text":"Good food, especially the crab cakes. We had a nice waitress tonight, she's so helpful and friendly. The shrimp etoufee is my favorite. Special beers from New Orleans on tap are the best!"}
{"text":"Likes: Cheese curds and nachos.

Dislikes: They are a very empty place (most cars I've ever seen was ten), they are very high, and I live in the neighborhood but this is a bad location for anything. This place is not visited a lot but I have noticed waitstaff skipping us. 

Find another place, because even finding this place in the first place (you must enter on Atlas Ave. by the Culver's and make a left, going past the bowling alley and it will be in the pink building) is a mess."}
{"text":"First time in their new location!  Menu is just as great. More room than the Butler Street location. We had the Cajun tacos with shrimp and crab cakes. We each ordered a small side salad which was plenty.. The Cajun mayo is a great touch, spicy but not too much. Corn tortillas with the tacos are more authentic and not often served around here. Whatever you order here, make sure you try the Leidenheimer bread directly shipped from New Orleans!  It is the most soft and tastiest French bread ever! We will be back for some jambalaya or etouffee in the near future!  The outdoor patio looks very nice too."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and had a very good time, between the awesome food and the good drinks. Will be back again!! Yummo."}
{"text":"I want to start out by specifically stating that the food here is incredible! The variety is amazing and the flavors are just explosive. The problem we have with this location is this service is horrendous. 

The staff we interacted with is always kind and courteous. They are just extremely understaffed. We have gone to this location multiple times and have experienced the exact same thing. It doesn't matter if it is a weekday or a weekend, exactly the same every time...

A solid 15 minutes before the first person even says hi to you, followed by an additional 15 minutes before you get your drinks. It can take up to an hour until there is food on your table. And although the staff is apologetic for the delays, it should not take 30 minutes to get even waters at your table.

This is sad for us, because the location is amazing. They're outside seating area is phenomenal, and now with the addition of horseshoes and volleyball, this could really get knocked out of the park. I understand you guys are working on margins, but get more staff. Please.  You do that, and you will get five stars from me all day any day."}
{"text":"Stopped in and we were seated immediately, and she was really nice. Our waiter was very nice and helpful as well, kept our drinks full and always made sure we were doing alright. I got the crawfish etouffee. It tasted fantastic! I only wish there were more bread, and more rice. All the etouffees I've had before the rice was almost double what I got here. I was also expecting a full crawfish garnished on the top, but no such luck. Just some minor touches they could do to improve on. My wife was interested in their make your own pasta, but if you add any meats it's far too expensive, even as an all you can eat pasta special. If your pasta costs more than your etouffee then you need to rethink things a little. Overall, thumbs up, and I look forward to returning. Man that etouffee was good!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner at North of the Bayou. If I closed my I eyes, I could have been sitting at my grandmother's kitchen table in Bunkie, Louisiana. And yes, Bunkie is a real place. I ordered the crawfish etouffe, and it was delicious. Just enough rice, lots of crawfish, okra, peppers, and a perfectly spiced sauce. Smokey, rich and just a bit hot. Jessi was delightful, and gave me plenty of time to savor this amazing dish. If and when I'm back in Madison, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed by this place. 

This neighborhood needs a few good new restaurants... I was hoping that this place would be our ray of light. And the we tried it...... ray of light... blown out with the quickness. 

Service was bad, bad, bad. 

Food was not very good. Got 12 chargrilled oysters and they were so small. Yes I get it.. you are thinking \"why the hell would this guy order oysters at such an interesting place like this?\".. good freaking question. I also got a po-boy... hahaha such a bummer. 

Stiff drinks though.. when we finally got them.  Only reason I gave it 2 stars. 

'And another one bites the dust'"}
{"text":"It took 50 minutes to be seated, 45 minutes to be served our APPETIZER. The raw oysters were good, the fish fry was okay. They ran out of tartar sauce on a Friday night. And we had to get all of our drinks at the bar; our waitress never took our drink order. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Hearing the amazing reviews on the downtown location I really had high hopes for my dining experience today.

The food was okay. Crab cakes were 10.99 and only got 2 which was disappointing. They were well prepared and tasted good. The main course Seafood PoBoy with remoulade was average. The dessert Beignet was an  amazing redeeming savior. 

I can't say much for the service. The hostess although she did greet us and other guests, she spent most of her time in the covered entrance on her phone while we were dining. Our waitress was quirky at times using some foul language. Something apparently happened with the printer so our order took a long time as well as with the dessert."}
{"text":"Went here last week for my mom's birthday with a group of 6. There was surprisingly almost no one there eating, but the bar was full. Our waitress was great. She was really nice and attentive.

I ordered the Red Beans and Rice and we had cheese curds and crab cakes for appetizers. The entree was AMAZING. Not a huge portion, but I appreciated that because you don't need much of something that filling.

The crab cakes were probably some of the best I've had. SO good! I want some right now.

It's a cool looking restaurant. Fun decorations and lots of seating. They have an extensive menu which is nice and lots of cocktails and beer.

The first few moments there were weird because we just stood at the front of the restaurant for a few minutes and no one was there to greet us or seat us and finally a bartender came over, so that was awkward.

Overall, we really enjoyed it and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We didn't even get a table when the place was empty or any type of acknowledgement. The hostess was unable to provide us any information on what was going on nor did we receive any customer service. Wish we had decent places in this area."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks after it opened, in February. The food was so good! I got the seafood gumbo, which was WAAAAYYY better than seafood gumbo I've experienced at New Orleans takeout in Madison, and even in NOLA itself (at a local staple). 
I liked the ambience too. Kinda neat in there. But yes, the service was a bit odd. And not too fast. At the time we were a table of two amongst half a dozen or so other tables. It seems like this is a common complaint. Will definitely be back for the food though, wow that gumbo was delicious. Next time I will skip the lunch sized portion, and go for the full on dinner portion- it's a much better value!!!!!"}
{"text":"New Orleans is my favorite place to visit and Cajun is my favorite food to cook and eat. Needless to say when I saw this place was open I was really excited and a little worried how it would measure up. I waited a month after they reopened to let them get settled. 
The place is very solid. The menu combines creole favorites and Cajun twists on Wisconsin favorites. The service was excellent and our waitress (Tory?) was attentive, kind and friendly. Cajun cheese curds were not spicy but delicious (waitress offered money back if we didn't like them). Drinks were good and their Abita beer selection is reason alone to come back. The bartender was excited to show the selection off. Their Creole dish was great. Spicy but not too much and came with crawfish (as a choice among other meats). Kids menu is limited and none were especially good-next time we will go with an entree for them to split. Fried ice cream is ok. Beignets were denser than I like-which usually comes from the frying oil not being hot enough or the beignet dough being refrigerated. Having it as a dessert item with food safety laws almost certainly guarantees the latter. They tasted ok, but I've never seen beignets with chocolate (on bottom of plate). My wife's BBQ pork sand which wasn't great but she wants to come back and try something different nonetheless. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Experience for a group of 6. Waitress was really nice and friendly. Quick service.

As for the food, the portion size was perfect with the full order. If you order the lunch size then the portion size may be too small.

Rich and flavorful food though.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try something different."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just too all-over the place. Right off the bat, the bright pink exterior throws you off. The place looks huge but yet I've never seen more than 10 cars in the parking lot and the dining area is not that big. The interior is very dim and odd compared to it's bright and festive exterior. There is a big bar area and a weirdly set up eating area. It is always FREEZING cold in here which is also inconvenient. 
Before rating the food, I will say, I'm not a big fan of overly spicy cajun food so do with this what you will. Everything here is extremely cajun and everything we ordered (even without the cajun seasoning) was spicy. A few people I was with said they're food was cold. The sweet potato fries we ordered as an appetizer were not good to say the least. The cheese curds and french fries were probably the most edible things we tried from there menu. After my second visit here, I left disappointed and set on not returning."}
