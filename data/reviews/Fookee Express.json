{"text":"It's my second time getting take out and I was pretty happy with the meal. I've pretty much tried all their standard dishes including eggplant with beef, general Tsao chicken, chicken and green beans and ma po tofu. Servings are generous and service is quick and courteous. Good value. It's much better than traditional food court Chinese food. Way Less msg and the ingredients are fresh. For example the chicken is not all flour and breading like some other Chinese fast food places. The stir fry veggies was also very fresh and light, with no heavy sauces. The stir fry chicken was white meat and very good quality meat I must say, for a fast food place. The best thing is they allow you to substitute the carb (fried rice or noodles) with stir fry veggies for free! They also have a loyalty card- buy six get one meal free. Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went back a second time and unfortunately was very disappointed. General Tso chicken was fatty and overcooked. Noodles were very tasty but almost half of them consisted of onions. The spring roll was okay, but was seemed to be entirely shredded cabbage and no other veggies. I ended up throwing half of my meal out :("}
{"text":"If you are looking for Chinese \"fast food\" at reasonable prices and portion, this place is acceptable. Taste wise it's what I call \"edible\". I ordered 2 dishes and both were slightly too salty. It's like ordering from one of those food court Chinese places but with a bigger selection. Definitely better value and taste than the food court variety."}
