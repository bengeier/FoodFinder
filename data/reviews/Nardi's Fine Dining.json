{"text":"This is a tough review to write. I am not one to ever knock a business, especially a new one, most especially an independent.  I rally around independent businesses and even cut them some slack as they figure it all out.  Having said that...  We made 9 PM reservations for Nardi's for New Years Eve. Ok. A risk, admittedly, it was their first NYE.  Food reviews for the place had been mercurial at best - people seemed to either love it or hate it.  We arrived at 8:40 PM. When the elevator door opened, the voices in my head told me to stay in the elevator and head back to the car.  It was a madhouse.  The earlier seatings had not cleared out yet - not a good plan. That earlier seating should have been well on their way out the door but, again, ok, first year, there are learning pains.  Now it began. Where do you put the 30 - 40 folks waiting for their tables? In a narrow hallway jammed in like sardines outside the dishroom.  We waited until 9:30 PM.  DH got whacked with a tray by a busboy who truly thought he could make it through (oops). We watched glasses drop and break. We saw plates of food and bones go by in our faces.  We watched maybe the hostess come out complaining as she was looking for a busboy to clear tables and throw her hands up in the air. It was crowded and frankly, not an appealing way to start the night. Busboys, waitresses, arriving guests and departing guests were all fighting for space in that same hallway.  At 9:24 PM, with the host not yet saying anything to the crowd and realizing that we were no closer to having anyone seated, we left.  Now, I figured if we were seated by 945 (with a prayer), maybe we would have appetizers by 1015 and entrees by 1045 or 1100.    With that thought in mind, we left and went elsewhere.  Chef, obviously you have a popular restaurant. And I am assuming maybe the food was so good that folks were willing to wait it out.  But please plan better for next year.  Space the seatings better so that you can clear out the early seating before the late seating arrives since you have no waiting area (the location is great because of the view but - it is what it is - you cannot change it much).  We may come back to try again someday - but certainly not on a holiday."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally have the opportunity to dine here and I am even more excited to review my experience - especially since I'm giving them a big 5 stars!  Details: I went on Valentine's Day with my date and they were quite busy. So much so, that we couldn't get a reservation until 9pm. There was a \"special\" Valentine's menu, which is code for a menu with less options, that are found on the usual menu but with double the prices. This is actually true. They left the main menu in the lobby of the building and upon inspection, we literally paid almost twice as much for some items. Typically, this would bother me, but the food and experience went so well that I walked out with a smile on my face. The \"everyday\" prices are actually quite affordable and I will definitely be back to enjoy the views during the daylight!  Atmosphere: The restaurant could boast slightly better decor, but its quite typical for a \"fancy\" restaurant. Almost hotel-like with white walls, blue carpet and gold wherever they can stick it. Other than that, it's a clean, well-lit space. Most of the walls on the outside of the building are total glass. Since it's on top of the Janette building in Monroeville, you have really cool views. With that being said, the views are of Monroeville, which even though is not that exciting, it's the only restaurant in the Pittsburgh area that has a similar experience, and on a sunny day, I can imagine seeing rolling hills for miles which is an equally wonderful view. One key point here is that we did not have a window seat and we still had spectacular views. The restaurant was wonderfully created to give a good view regardless of where you're sitting.   Food/Drink: Good! Decent selection of beer and wine and averagely priced. We started off with an appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms, which were perfect. We could have used more, but we're big eaters. I got the crab cakes for my main meal. They were some of the best crab cakes I've ever had. Incredibly \"meaty\" and fresh, and while you only get two medium-sized cakes with potatoes, they fill you up since they are more dense than normal. My date got the chicken Florentine. His portion was huge and it came with two fried ravioli which were phenomenal. We didn't get dessert because (surprisingly) we were quite full by the end.   I will definitely be back to try desserts and to see the view during sunlight!"}
{"text":"I wish I were not saying this. I wish I could be giving a better review.  Wife and I ate at Nardi's once, don't see any reason to go back. I had high hopes for this restaurant. Based on all we knew, we were expecting a very nice fine dining experience, so expectations were up there. The location, the theme, the potential, but alas, their potential is not nearly met. Location and theme, others have chimed in on so I skip that. .  We had 7:30 reservations, but did not get seated until after 8. There were many people waiting in the bar area, and many were complaining to the host about their wait. Very crowed and lots of jostling in the waiting period. I noticed regulars by their familiarity with the staff. These seemed to know their way around, about when to come, where to sit and who to know. I am sure the care and feeding of the regulars put some of the rest of us behind in ours. To me I saw a lack of skill and professionalism in the front of house management. For me they could do a lot better job of managing their guests, taking reservations and moving people about. Were were told they had seated a large party and so were running far behind. Sad stories make me cry and not to want to come back. Once seated the services was slow to get started and slow in between courses. After all of this, we found the food to be just okay - so- so, and nothing worth going through all the aggravation for. The prices are very high for the quality of the food and service. We won't go back any time soon, but I would really like to see Nardi's turn it around. I'll be reading all the Yelper reviews hoping to see signs of hope and value up there on the top of the Jonnet Building. Come on Nardi's I am rooting for you."}
{"text":"When it comes to Italian food, this is the place.  I don't live in the area but I do have family here in Pittsburgh, so whenever I'm in town it is 100% necessary to go and eat at Nardi's.  I think Nardi's has only been open for a year or two, but we used to go eat at the restaurant the chef use to run.  But this is his new spot, and its worth checking out.    We had a group of five and decided to go big and have a 5 course meal.  We started with an appetizer of spicy stuffed peppers.  Now we don't have hot peppers on the west coast (or should I say good hot peppers), so these were a treat and absolutely delicious.  We then had salads.  I had the house salad with the house balsamic dressing.  It was tangy but not overpowering.  Our third course was pasta (as any true Italians eat).  We ordered angel hair family style and each had a small bowl.  Yummy.    Main course time.  I went with the godfathers chicken.  It was sooooo good.  Its hard to describe.  Its thin chicken that is lightly breaded and served with a butter lemon sauce that has hot peppers and mushrooms in it.  Let me tell you, its good.  I would give it a try.  After our entrees we had dessert which was different kinds of cakes and ice cream.    Overall, the food is amazing.  The location is on the top floor of a office building -  not your typical thing but has good views.  Just park your car, go inside, get in the elevator, and hit the top floor button.  You will get right to the restaurant.  They have a bar (with a view) which was pretty cool, but we ordered drinks at the table.    I will be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to this restaurant since our reservations at another restaurant were cancelled due to it being closed.  We were both very pleasantly pleased.  The greeting was immediate and we were given a choice of tables.  We selected the corner against the glass one.  Service was excellent.  She was there when needed but didn't hover or make us feel like we needed to hurry up.  She also was honest about recommendations when asked.    The noise level was nice - no blasting music so everybody has to scream over each other; we could have a conversation.  We both had one glass of wine which was good.  Nice choice on the wine menu.  I had the merlot which was really good; my friend had the cab and liked it as well.  We started out with salads and then to the entree.  My friend had the vegetarian risotto which was EXCELLENT.  Perfect texture and loads of flavor.  i had the wild mushroom ravioli which was very good.  Sauce wasn't overpowering, the raviolis were excellent and very flavorful.    I would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I took my sister out to dinner on a weekday night after hearing positive things about Nardi's.  If you're curious about its location, it's on the top floor of the Jonnet Building on 22 (where Monterrey Bay used to be).  This restaurant provides a fantastic view of Business Monroeville. You can see Target AND Giant Eagle! Wow!   A note about the menu: it includes many veal, steak, and chicken entrees. Contrary to its Italian-sounding Name, Nardi's only offers a few pastas. A twofold warning for you vegetarians! 1. There is a little under a handful of choices for you and 2. The chef LOVES bacon and prosciutto. No, really. Bacon is on the casear salad. It's in the salad dressing. Prosciutto wraps half the appetizers and a few of the meat entrees. MY GOD, IT'S EVERYWHERE! I have a suspicion that half of the pork heading to Pittsburgh ends up in a Nardi's dish.  On to our personal experience...  Unfortunately, we found the bread quite stale. Not a great start.  Little Z and I then split an appetizer, stuffed mushrooms. This was good, but for the price, I expected more than three medium-sized caps.   Next came the salads. I had a tasty caesar salad topped with... you guessed it! Bacon! Sister had the chef salad, surprisingly pig-free.   We both chose steak for our main dishes. I ordered the 6 oz filet and she ordered the stuffed 10 oz filet. My steak was perfectly cooked and topped with mushrooms. Yum!  Sister said her steak was \"good.\"  It was stuffed with provolone and bacon (say WHAT?) and wrapped in... go ahead and guess. Prosciutto.   To wrap up the evening, we shared a death-by-chocolate cake which tasted like it had very recently been defrosted.   Overall, we found Nardi's to be a three-star restaurant charging five-star prices. For that reason, I give it two stars. That'll do, pig. That'll do."}
