{"text":"I ate here after reading the reviews on yelp. It was just OK, I got the big Jim. What aburger has gravy and biscuits that's just as good.  Looked like a bunch of goth skater cooks trying to serve some home style food. My friend ate with me and he wasn't very impressed either. I had a QT cup because QT ice tea is bomb and one of the skater workers said because of the liqueur license I had to throw it away. It was ok, I went, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"If in Phoenix eat here. Fried Chicken and a Champaign-a-cane. Fucking fabulous on a Sunday morn."}
{"text":"great place for a hipster and off-beat dinner. be prepared to wait a while if busy, because the service is slow. it has amazing comfort food though, and the experience and meal is well-worth the wait!! definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Seen this place many times decided to give it a try. Cons: all I ordered was a burger with bacon and cheese on it with a bottle of water and they charged me 17.37 for it?? I was in a hurry so didn't check my bag which I usually do but didn't this one time. I know I asked for fries but didn't get them. The burger wasn't anything special, I could have made it  at home. For $17 I was thinking wow I must be getting a big ass burger. Lol it was big but kind of flat and very greasy. There is parking off the street or you can park in the lot next to them next to a water station. Pros: I learned my lesson about looking at what I'm paying for! And the art on the fence was nice. That's about it."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not bad, had distinct flavors and portion was sufficient(big Jim and roasted spouts).   Only complaint is it should be accompanied with a more hearty side then three small watermelon squares !"}
{"text":"The wait it a little much, but the location, food and the weather when we went made for a perfect evening. Everything about this location is bomb. The diner area is a little small but the outside seating is fine as long as the weather permits.  Everything I've ever ordered off their menu has been excellent. Chicken sandwich is my favorite.  The staff all seem to really enjoy being there and take their time to make the experience special. The kitchen area seems cramped but the guys working the grill had a practiced hand and the food came out quicker than I would expect (although slower than most places with a full kitchen staff)  If you are looking to a unique date spot or a nice evening hangout with friends this is the spot."}
{"text":"Really cool little casual place to eat with great food!"}
{"text":"Be ready for yum. These guys hit all the right notes - quality food with no pretense. This is what diner food should be. Get a nice drink to start, then order the special. Whatever it is, it is what you should have that day. Scratch made tomatillo gravy, brunch burger with spicy ketchup, etc. Cool staff are eager to please, chef that knows his stuff - works the flattop like the pro he is."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a few days and wanted to find a unique, good place to eat.  Found both in Welcome Diner.  It's in the middle of a fairly residential area near downtown.  Very informal and looks almost like a Foster's Freeze type place with mostly outdoor seating.  I sat at the counter.  The three young guys working were having a great time cooking, talking to guests and listening to, oddly enough, late-60's rock music.  Had the Big Jim and Poutine.  Ate about 2/3 of the first and 1/4 of the second only because it's an incredible amount of food.  Great tasting comfort food at great prices.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for more than an hour for our food on a Sunday night... I hope that it is worth this ridiculously long wait!"}
{"text":"It was a really cool environment and unique from the vast majority of the Phoenix area. We enjoyed their commitment to fresh and quality ingredients. Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and prompt.   HIghly recommend to come after dark in the summer because it is so blazing hot (mostly outdoor seating). We will definitely be returning for more pulled pork fries!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I decided to take a chance on this little place. Great food at a fair price. And, great service to boot. I had their chicken and cheddar biscuit called the Little Birdy and was in heaven. The chicken was moist with great flavor, not greasy, and not doughy. The biscuit it was on was perfection. Crispy and fluffy where it needed to be with a well balanced butteryness. To make things even better the biscuit did not fall apart after the first bite :). Loved the relaxed atmosphere and music selection outside. The dudes that were working were very courteous and answered questions without eye rolling like you may get at other downtown establishments."}
{"text":"This place had some pretty spot on food! The atmosphere was pretty quaint and enjoyable. Nice little joint. Only downside was the limited hours...it'd be nice to be able to grab lunch during the week here, but the hours won't allow for that option."}
{"text":"The big Jim and the Carol are both fantastic. It is also a really nice place to sit outside in the evening."}
{"text":"Since bringing the magic of Old Dixie's food truck into their kitchen a couple months ago, The Welcome Diner has been hands-down my favorite spot in Phoenix. The food here is incredible. Their burgers are better than what you would get at Deluxe, and the vibe is way cooler. But forget burgers - if you go there, you've gotta get the fried chicken, bacon, cheddar, and gravy biscuit sandwich. It will blow your mind. Everything is sourced locally and made fresh in the vein of Matt's Big Breakfast. The staff is awesome, and it's the most relaxed atmosphere you could find. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Proof that art can come from a two burner kitchen. Laughably small kitchen creates some very big tastes. Plan to go on a cool night and enjoy the great patio. Not an indoor diner, it's soul food and stars. Big Jim, Cannibal fries and Coke in a bottle. Great experience, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in phoenix. unless you're at the bar, there is only outside seating, but in good weather it's great. Parking can be dodgey depending on the time of day but never too bad. The place itself has charming decor and great staff. I recommend going at night because the lights are great ambiance."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to eat in Phoenix. Food is always solid and atmosphere is laid back. Our favorite place to take people"}
{"text":"Geez, I love love love this place. Love the hurricanes, the pulled pork, the fried chicken, the biscuits, the burgers, the gravy, the 'dining in a trailer park' atmosphere.  The only thing I don't like is that rave reviews are going to make it impossible for us to stroll in on a Saturday night and get a seat at the counter. But they deserve them."}
{"text":"this is probably the coolest diner in downtown phoenix. all organic ingredients, a kickass interior (it's super small, but totally rad), and great people working. say hi to the bearded jewish cook, andy, and he will make your food just the way you want it, and also, with love.  the food is totally cheap and tastes exquisite. you can also eat outside, if you want.   it's located on a nondescript corner in a residential area, so it's easy to miss, but this place is definitely worth checking out if you're downtown.  also, the hours up there ^^ say it's open until 5, but i am pretty sure they close at 3."}
{"text":"So a couple of months ago my co-worker and I were on a dangerous mission to find the one great burger in town. After months of search and going into some of the seediest joints in town, we arrived at Welcome Diner, I was a bit skeptical that this place could produce a burger  that my co-worker and I were so desperately seeking, but oh how rad being wrong is, they knocked the shit out of my taste buds with there burger, I got a double with cheese with a fried egg on top (old school son), I literally finished the burger before my co-worker got his (which was like 5 seconds later) , a true delight.   If you go bring cash money thats all they take, also its a small joint so don't go brining like 40 of your office buddies you'll look like a tool."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly overrated. The service is exceptionally slow, the food is bland, the biscuits are dry, the portions are small, the seating is limited, and the prices are high for what you get. I've been here on multiple occasions each time hoping the prior experience was a one off, but with no different outcome. I wanted to be a fan of this place after hearing the hype and reading the reviews but it really doesn't cut it. I'd highly recommend tempering your expectations as this place is memorable for all of the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"I had a spring salad and my friend had a welcoming breakfast. Both of them are great! If they can use a bigger bowl for salad , it will be better because it is hard to toss the salad in a small bowl."}
{"text":"Best place to chill downtown, period. Amazing comfort food and an excellent little cocktail menu. Super dog friendly, too. If you don't eat fried chicken and biscuits, try their fried green tomato sandwich, grilled cheese (which comes with amazing tomato confit), or mac and cheese (with added confit or Brussels sprout)."}
{"text":"Great little place. In a nice neighborhood, the best garlic chicken sandwich I've ever had. love the fries too. nice people."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch with my friends in this place. Very cool and nice place to eat. It has a bar open all day,and that what I liked the most. The food is good and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"Welcome diner is very quaint and incredibly unique, I haven't seen anything else like it in the valley. It's a converted house in the middle of a neighborhood, but it looks like it's straight out of a movie. The food is good and the menu is unique; I love the variety. My favorites on the menu are poutine and the mac and cheese, but I've heard good things about every other menu item! I will say, wait times can become incredibly long. The staff seems incredibly hard working, but they have a small kitchen and are very popular which makes for long wait times. If you're willing to wait, Welcome Diner is worth it!"}
{"text":"I feel like I need a cardiologist on call after my delicious and greasy meal indulgence at Welcome Diner. The burger, fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit, fries with gravy on top and fries with bacon and cheese on top are all heavenly. Fried avocado Po' boy was also divine. Add a few hurricanes and I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Scratch-made super delicious food!  Love the laid back vibe and the fact that we were able to eat inside and interact with our bartender and other diners.  We had the Koko, Fried Green Tomato sandwich with bacon and the pountine fries!  Yum, Yum and Yum!  Not to mention the awesome crafted cocktails!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my Lordy, this place is great! The cocktails with fresh ingredients and yummy!! The food is awesome and the staff is so much fun, professional and great! The fried green tomato sandwich, the mac & cheese with chorizo AND bacon and the Carol - yum!!! We are coming back! The drive from Cave Creek is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix so relying on Yelp.  Welcome diner seemed liked a good spot, and maybe on any other night it is but took us over an hour to get our food.  Kitchen seemed small to handle the volume, but mostly frustrated seeing others who ordered same dish after us get served before us.  Some food may be worth +hour wait but not this food - chicken biscuit, Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts... Nothing to write home about, think you'll say the same if you've had any standouts of the dishes mentioned above. Can't give more than 2 stars for an overrated place that made me wait over an hour for food that didn't taste exceptional."}
{"text":"OMG! Their food is friggin' delicious! Ordered some sort of breakfast biscuit which entailed an entire fried breast of chicken, tons of bacon and topped off with cheddar cheese. Since it was my first time (and I was starving) I also order a side of sausage gravy and the grit cake. This wasn't a cheap lunch at about $20 with a sweet tea, but it did knock me on my a$$. I ended up splitting the entire sandwich with a friend and we were both stuffed to the gills. My only complaint (very minor) was that the grit cake could have been a teensy weensy bit larger. Other than that I was totally satisfied with the meal, setting and staff.  Thanks Welcome Diner! Happy to have you in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best diner I've been to. Nothing in Cali compares to this. Great service, intimate charming space with emphasis on out door seating. We order 2 drinks that they recommended, a stout beer on tap that tasted like coffee (yummy), and a wheat citrus beer . The food was on point, we had the Big Jim biscuit  (I think that's what it's called) and the bbq jackfruit fries ( amazing entree for vegans and non-vegan  taste better than pulled pork and it's cruelty free). This place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Okay...I have been going here for a while and I love the place and the food!  I am surprise it hasn't had as many reviews as it should.  The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint..  The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture!  Its small but fitting...  The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it.. Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:)  Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but true!  Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite joint.  It is becoming quite the neighborhood favorite and I think it's because they just do it right. The setting is so...welcoming. With the lawn chairs and variety of mostly outdoor seating this is the perfect spot for a beautiful day or night. The staff is a bunch of characters who are very genuine and helpful. The food has clever names like \"Holy Puerco and Captain Fantasy\") oh and it is freaking amazing. Even the menu's artwork looks awesome (done by a local artist/cartoonist.)  I've been here three weekends in a row. The first time I had the Captain Fantasy which was endlessly delicious. Barbecued chicken on a fresh homemade biscuit with bacon, cheese and greens. I also had fries, wow a lot of food! The other two times I've had the Sunrise Sandwich with sausage and an egg over easy. It is also placed between a tasty biscuit along with some arugula. Yum! My boyfriend has had the welcome breakfast with chorizo and the Little Birdy. I had bites! I also tried their fried avocado, genius.  They serve drinks. Apparently on Tuesdays they have Hurricane Tuesdays, $5 for their famous hurricanes. I've also heard their Bloody Mary's are brilliant.  Well done Welcome Diner well done. See you all next weekend!"}
{"text":"I had a burger and collard greens for a side. it was $17.   It was ok, but I expected better. Outdoor seating was nice. Too bougee imo"}
{"text":"This place is great local diner open late good beer on tap great service usually and perfect ambiance especially the bathroom. All the food is good. I am partially vegetarian, yet I will  eats me some fried chicken here mm m m m mmmmmm"}
{"text":"What a great dive! Welcome Diner has a Happy Hour. I got Carolina BBQ fries and a homemade ginger beer.  That beer had so much ginger it tasted peppery and it is strong! So delicious! The fries were a touch too salty with the mustard based BBQ and vinegar slaw. John got a Big Jim with was a huge biscuit with fries chicken, bacon, and covered in a yummy peppered sausage gravy. We also got sausage gravy and biscuits. For dessert we got beignets. Foods not perfect but VERY freshly prepared and pretty darn yummy!  This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Burger was really good tried the fries they werent bad i like set up. Like that it didnt taste like a regular burger"}
{"text":"Their idea of $8+ poutine is white gravy on a sad amount of fries? Pathetic. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to take friends and family that are in town. It's my to go spot for late night food. Try some basil on your hurricane, that's my jam. Love the people and the food. Always good vibes."}
{"text":"My friend and I landed in Phoenix and came here for our first dinner. We loved everything from the outdoor seating, the food, and the drinks. My friend had the Welcome Burger and really enjoyed it. I ordered the brussel sprouts, jackfruit fries, and beignets to share. The brussel sprouts plate was large and filling and delicious. While the idea of jackfruit fries sounded appealing, I thought the taste got drowned out a bit by the barbecue sauce. We shared the beignets, and throughly enjoyed it. Overall a good meal at a super chill diner!"}
{"text":"The staff here went above and beyond to make sure our experience here was out of this world. The best part? They treated everyone that way. Whether you were a regular, or were here for your first time! The food was mind blowing. My family of four inhaled everything on our plates! The only disappointing thing is there is not one in our hometown! I STRONGLY urge everyone to stop by, and enjoy the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Super cozy diner.  It's small and doesn't have much of a street presence so it's fairly easy to miss if you aren't paying attention.  The diner is a classic boxcar that stays true to it's roots.  The outdoor seating area looks quite enjoyable for a late night snack, though I'm not sure if they are open that late.  Gotta love the outdoor ordering window.  You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.    We arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.    I had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.  Just a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.  Pretty embarrassing but the chef didn't seem to mind and trusted us to return.  Can't complain about any part of the meal and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix or any locals that have been snoozing on this gem."}
{"text":"The people here are very nice. Excellent customer service. The Welcome Diner is one really awesome place. The food was SO GOOD! I forgot the name of what I ordered, but it was essentially a pulled pork sandwich...I loved it. Their ginger beer is amazing, too."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food at Welcome Diner.  The food is locally sourced.  The salads are better than any other I have come across and the burgers are rated in the top 3 by my husband and myself.  As per usual in Phoenix, you don't get good food without paying a fair chunk of change, but I would take Welcome Diner over 90% of the places in Phoenix for the quality, Organic, locally sourced items and the chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!!!!! I work at he hospital right next to it and love this Place!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the coolest places I've been to in Phoenix. It's hidden in the historic district of Garfield in between homes. It is a laid back, chill vibe. Reminds me of some of the hole in the wall places I've found on a tropical vacation out of the country. A perfect place to have some cocktails and spend hours talking with friends while sitting on picnic tables under string lights. I recommend going at night. The food was decent, but the atmosphere and drinks will keep me coming back. Also, they are dog friendly! You've got to check it out if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"You want amazing food try this place. The pulled pork fries are delicious. As is the ginger beer and take the recommendation of the staff you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? The only thing that comes to mind is PLEASE, for the LOVE of everything good and holy, open a location in the Bay Area...or give me the rights and I'll do it myself. =) Really love everything the Diner stands for - local, fresh, well thought out food that helps others understand the true passion that goes into each dish. The story behind both Welcome Diner and Chicken + Donuts will make you appreciate these places even more.  Go for the food, stay for a cocktail and leave with a smile....I always do! Thank you WD staff for being so bad @$$ - continue to kill it!"}
{"text":"The Big Jim and the beignets have been on my foodie bucket list for some time and I finally stopped by last Sat.  The food was good (not great) but the ambiance was totally unacceptable.  They had a DJ playing music at an obnoxious volume. Not only was it at an unneighborly volume for being in a residential setting, but it was larded with the most objectionable vulgarities.  If I were a neighbor we would have a real problem.  As it is, I will most definitely NOT be a return customer."}
{"text":"*nom nom nom!*  Mm, this place is the perfect eatery for a lazy Sunday, or if you are skipping school or work as it's quite naughty.  One of those mimosas and bloody marys in the morning kind of days.  The Garfield is extremely satisfying and the french toast in a cup is genius, if a bit sticky.  But since we are being naughty eating here a little stickiness is probably appropriate!  It is tiny tiny, but I find it amusing rather than annoying."}
{"text":"Great find!!! The food is very good with a welcome unique flare!! The atmosphere is chill and comfortable! The staff is very friendly and really tries to get to know its patrons. I've had the Big Jim, Fried green tomatoes sandwich, and \"back by popular demand\" The Champion. All very tasty! It's my goal to try everything on the menu! Love, love, love this place. It belongs on a food network channel show, but because I don't want to have to wait in a line down the road to order food, I hope it doesn't...haha!!!"}
{"text":"A very neat and little place!! Awesome fried chicken sandwich!!! and a cool staff. I will try again when I am downtown."}
{"text":"Favorite new spot: 1. Best biscuits in Phoenix. 2. Amazing food. 3. Delicious libations. 4. Great staff. 5. Reasonable prices. 6. Crystal's Hot Sauce."}
{"text":"Everyone who works here LoveS their job and it shows. The friend green tomato sandwich is my favorite. Pulled pork fries are a must and a whisky sour to tie it together."}
{"text":"This place is no joke. The biscuits are to die for. Pork Fries are unreal. I wish I had more room in my stomach to try everything on the menu. The service is top notch as well."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food. I get takeout from WD at least once a week."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. Really one of the best all-around meals I've ever had. The burger was one of the best I've ever had, or maybe the best.. . Just the quality of the beef was so tasty. Even the pain fries were notably delicious. Portions are good, they serve the full menu until closing, and like... How can plain fries be so delicious??   Husband unit and I had Mac and cheese (plain, but still amazing). He had the welcome burger, I had a koko chicken and biscuit (good, but his burger was better), plain fries, coleslaw (vinegar based), and bignets. All. Amazing. So amazing that we're coming back here before we fly home, which is saying something because we typically like to try everying new on vacation.   There's 90% outdoor seating. It's definitely chill. Service is really friendly and casual... Like you're at an outdoor bbq kind of. Cokes are by the bottle, and there's fileted water self-serve from a cooler.   Working on crunchy, sweet, hot bignets right now... Must stop reviewing before husband eats them all.   COME HERE NOW."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place! It has a laid back ambiance and is so unique! The food is a mix of New Orleans style and is so tasty! I'd recommend the poutine fries and the fried green tomato sandwich.  Also they make pretty good cocktails, and even make their own tonic! You need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Get the Little Birdy, only $6 on HH! I have got it the last few times cause the Poutine was starting to get too filling for me as I'd almost pass out while I was still there lol The chicken is the juiciest chicken EVER! And you would think you'd need more than just a biscuit, chicken, and cheese to make a sandwich but thanks to this place you don't! It's so simple & perfect and pairs real nice with their $6 Old fashioned during Happy Hour!  An awesome (filling) meal and a fantastic drink for only $12 total, uh yeah I think that sounds good!! Always me to give them a much better tip, which they deserve and you should too!  Do It! Do it now! or wait until HH either way, either way!"}
{"text":"Really 4.5 stars.   I love riding my bike here and I love devouring their share fries.....I NEVER SHARE!!!!!   Awesome neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"I love Big Jim! I mean, I love the sandwich Big Jim here at Welcome Diner. Gravy, Fried Chicken, biscuit, glorious.  Nearly all of the food here will clog your arteries, but it tastes so damn good who really cares about that.  I don't know what the hell a Jackfruit is but it tastes as good as any bbq meat sandwich I've had. The drinks are made to order too and are quite tasty.  Only real complaint is I think it's a tad overpriced for the amount of food you get with certain sandwiches.  Sometimes the line can be ridiculously long especially on first friday so just, ya know, prepare to wait for that Big Jim."}
{"text":"Both chicken and donuts and the diner are two of my favorite places to eat in the world. Food makes you feel so good and service is always very kind. Try the jack fruit fries, they're my favorite. They make me sooooo gassy but I don't even care it's worth farting all night long to eat them."}
{"text":"The burger I got was scrumptious as well as the fries it came with. Cute cozy spot awesome for a late night bite. The grilled cheese was ok .. Would be better with maybe a bit less bread and more cheese ."}
{"text":"8/10 on the hipster-o-meter. Really friendly staff. I had the big jim and my friend had the watermelon salad. Both were really good. 2 minor negatives would be the price ($9 for chicken bacon biscuit sandwich) and lack of seating."}
{"text":"My new favorite late night food spot. The cocktails were outstanding (do yourself a favor and get the whiskey sour) and the portions were large and delicious. My girlfriend and I split the Jim Bob and it was plenty for a late night snack. My only disappointment was that it took me almost 8 months living here to find the place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so good. The chicken is so moist and have no bleaching, and fillers..a must try!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but welcome diner gave me every reason to start. I bartend and serve at another local restaurant and have to give it to them for their excellent service. The guy behind the counter was so enthusiastic about the food, and was patient with us since it was our first time.   I got the champion burger and shared the pork fries. WOW, definitely the best burger I've had in a while. Cooke perfectly med-rare and the flavors were perfect.   They also had a great beer and cocktail list..   It's a must try, and I'm looking forward to coming back to try the fried chicken.   YUM!"}
{"text":"Cool hang. Killer food. Gives a whole new twist to what diner food can be. Totally playing to the strengths of Phoenix. One of the best burgers I've had in town. Killing it here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome eats. Kick ass staff. Late night hours. Fabulous Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to eat and good food to boot!  Grilled biscuits and great chicken.  Try the fried green tomato sandwich."}
{"text":"Saw photos and reviews on yelp and we had to try it out. It was amazing! The employees were really really nice, they made us feel at home. I love the atmosphere. Would defiantly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 solid stars for the unique and delicious food.  The chicken, gravy and biscuit was on point.  My girlfriend got a vegan sandwich that had a good acidity to it.  Know going in that the stereotypical hipster/dramacool crowd following is strong here and act entitled.  The guys taking orders and cooking, however moved with urgency and provided good customer service.  All in all a great late night spot with food options for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Love the atmosphere and the staff is always so friendly. It's a small place, but we always seem to find somewhere to sit. The fried green tomato sandwich has to be the best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible flavors! I'm usually one to avoid the hipster hot spots, but this place cannot be passed up. The burgers are just straight up impressive. Even my partner, who orders his plain, ketchup only, raves about them. Unfortunately for the burgers, the fried chicken is even better. The Koko is to die for! Perfectly fried, crispy chicken with a perfectly spiced chipotle ranch, served on a biscuit with arugula and a tomato slice.  While the food is great, what really has me coming back is the home brewed ginger beer. It's spicy and biting but all around refreshing. So unique and flavorful! Made of the exact stuff that makes this place so special."}
{"text":"This place has a place in my heart! It's not your normal sit down restaurant & it can be hard to find a seat when they're busy but it's all part of the experience! Every time I go, I get amazing service and everyone is so nice. One of the male employees there even knows my order. The food is amazing. I'm a creature of habit, so I always get pulled pork fries & a second generation drink, but the big jim & there jalapeno burger are great too. They have awesome happy hour deals too, and are opened late."}
{"text":"Loved this quirky place! Between the 3 of us we ordered the grilled cheese on a biscuit, the Carol (BBQ pork) and the Big Jim (for especially hearty appetites.  The flavors were amazing! Loved the mustard BBQ sauce on my Carol.  Really wanted to try the Beignets but they were out f them already. Cest la vie...a reason to come back for sure."}
{"text":"The Fried Mother F***ing Chicken. Damn. DAMN! Nice crisp crust with a juicy a** center. Damn. And that's where it starts.   Shut up because I'm going to talk about the biscuits. One: bread is amazing, but this bread. Damn. It has a soft crunch when you bite then a moist center.   So you have the juicy a** chicken and this bomb a** bread put that together and you know what you get... F***ING-OMG-SHUT UP I just had the best fried chicken sandwich in Phoenix. This is there speciality, so just order one. There are different variations of this sandwich. Doesn't matter which one you get they're all amazing!!!   The Must Eats:  Fries. Bomb. Burgers. Bomb.   If you get there for Happy Hour get the pork fries... PORK FRIES!!! I don't need to explain how good these fries are. Just shut up then unshut up and order them."}
{"text":"This diner came well recommended by the nice folks at the Phoenix hostel just a few blocks away. Easy walking distance in this cool little neighborhood from the hostel and the fun stuff to do on 5th street.   The old diner still has the 50's vibe with classic neon, but the food is non-classical diner fare (in a great way), is healthy and satisfying, and the folks working there are legit - down to earth and friendly. Just chill folks, no pretense, great food.   It's awesome to be back in the \"south\" and see iced tea on the menu. I kept requesting more, and the cool tattooed chick just brought me out a pitcher, a whole bowl of lemon slices and a smile.  That's hospitality.   I had the \"KOKO\", a hand breaded, fried chicken breast in a homemade biscuit with some kind of homemade remoulade, baby greens, tomato and a side of vinegar-based red coleslaw. Awesome. Friends had a deep fried avocado (vegan) po-boy and the other gad the fish po-boy, both of which looked great.   Definitely coming back.  Edit:  BTW, just saw on their online menu that they have a beer terrine salad, don't know how I overlooked that last night, but I'm kicking myself. Any place that has beets on the menu gets an automatic A++."}
{"text":"A friend brought me and some classmates here to celebrate the end of the semester and I was very surprised by the quality! There is practically no parking and most of the seating is outside, so plan accordingly. The decor is funky and unique, I had fun looking around.    I ordered a hurricane and beneigts and instantly  felt like I was back in New Orleans! Fresh and yummy! Everything we ordered came out within about 15min, which is quite impressive considering how tiny the kitchen is! I would go back for a fun night treat, as they are open late!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place yesterday night for a late dinner(1am), and was amazingly surprise. The ambiance, the decoration, the friendly staff. It was happy hour and we had the pork fries ($7) the portion was huge and it was really tasty. It's also a full bar and they make great cocktails!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just awesome. The biscuits are buttery, the chicken is juicy. The food is simple, done well, and delicious; plus it's minutes from our house.  Can't wait to come back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Welcome for some years now and I can't get enough! Everything on the menu is amazing and so are the drinks. Hurricaaaaane! I like to sit inside at the bar. It's a nice cozy spot for a date night. I only wish they were still open for brunch on the weekends!!!"}
{"text":"This is the homiest  most delicious place to visit. You won't be disappointed in the chicken, biscuit & gravy combo. I had to try chorizo, also delic! Nicest and friendliest guys around!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town. This place is amazing from the staff to the food ist incredible. The Po'boy Fish sandwich is really really good I get that and the Kiko i think... something along those lines is a breat burger."}
{"text":"The fried green tomato sandwich is amazing! I had one last night for dinner, and it's the first thing I thought about when I woke up this morning. And the whiskey sour was delicious, too. Super friendly and helpful staff, to boot. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Coconut cream grits with collards and tomato sauce.  As vegan as it gets, and so full of flavor!  Had it twice...once on Thursday and again on Saturday.  Ran into 4 friends while I sat at the counter Saturday evening.  This place is the best."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that are so good and so small that the idea of giving 5 stars frightens me because it's bound to get busier.  But Welcome Diner unquestionably deserves all of them.    Not sure what to get?  Start with the Welcome Burger your first time there.  They are better than what you want when you're looking for a really great American burger.   Can't wait to try the biscuits next time.  Atmosphere is laid back.  Bathroom is tiny. Food is very tasty, classic honemade yumness.  Experience it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great customer service and the foods is top notch! Would definitely come again and again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! The food(I ordered burgers and fries) was very delicious. The place is easy to found. Outdoor seating was available. Went to the restaurant by myself. And will come with my friends next time."}
{"text":"The food was not exceptional more average and limited menu and the staff could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"What a great place. The food is amazing, the portions are huge, and the atmosphere is friendly. I really enjoyed having the carol over fries, with slaw... yum."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, looked for a place to eat late at night and found this place. Would recommend the Champion burger, pulled pork fries, sunrise biscuit, and beignets"}
{"text":"Me and my family came to welcome diner had the no way Jose burger biscuits with goat cheese and jam and had the sweet beignets with local honey it was very succulent delicious and the bomb I give it 5 stars you got to get here"}
{"text":"I am from out of town, but one place the locals recommended consistently was Welcome Diner so I figured I'd give it a try.  The ambiance and decor are very warm and inviting- lots of outdoor seating and strung lights. Tables were clean and kept, but we ended up sitting inside at the bar for the air conditioning. Staff is incredibly friendly! We went earlier in the night and it was a bit slow- so we were able to talk to the staff and ask for favorites and specials. The cook named Ryne was very helpful and had a great knowledge of the menu! I am a vegetarian and there were quite a few unique options for me. I ended up getting the fried tomato sandwich with a side of jackfruit fries. Both were excellently prepared and the service was great.  Thank you Ryne and the rest of Welcome diner for a great meal! I will be coming back every time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Found this lil' gem by tapping around the Yelp map after arriving at Sky Harbor, and not wanting Mexican. Feels pretty sketchy en route, like there's no way there's a 5 star diner around this corner, couldn't be more wrong! Hands down, best joint in all of Phoenix. Quaint outdoor seating and the most incredible home cooked southern style dinning. Every single thing was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE. Any time I have friends visiting from out of town, I bring them here - the atmosphere, staff, and food are absolutely amazing. My favorite thing on the menu is definitely the PB&B Burger. UGH so weird and so perfect.   It's wonderful that such a unique place exists in the neighborhood - love having cool places to show people to prove that Phoenix really is a fun place to live."}
{"text":"Seems like everyone working here cares about what they do. That's a wonderful recipe for deliciousness and a great time. :-)  And they drink Fernet to celebrate milestones. That's a very good sign.  Oh, and everything I ate and smelled was insanely delicious!"}
{"text":"I once thought of this place as far inferior to many restaurant chains such as IHOP, but after my recent travels here, I feel as if I have discovered one of Phoenix's true hidden gems. The service was excellent and the store had a very welcoming vibe. Staff is really kind and friendly to everyone! Great food as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I can't get enough of it! They make their own ginger beer! Chicken and waffles! Biscuits! PBR! Huzzah! The poutine is a must try. The atmosphere is casual and friendly, not too hipster (but juuuust hipster enough to make people watching great), and the cocktails are tasty."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Super friendly staff and super good food. Such a good time and dog friendly!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled jackfruit po' boy and was disappointed.  The barbecue sauce and the cole slaw in the sandwich were too tart that they overpowered the jackfruit.  I'm not ready to write off this place yet. Will have to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We ordered food at 10:30 and it's 11:15 pm still no food. The company I'm with is highly irritated and has made the entire experience very bad. First and last time here."}
{"text":"Great place (the summary). I was in PHX to work for a few hours and catch a red-eye flight - of course used Yelp to find a place for dinner.  Welcome Diner - great concept, great execution and great food!  It took me awhile to figure out its location - I drove by it a few times before I realized - oh that's the restaurant and found a parking spot behind the restaurant.  You walk up to the to a window/counter and order from the posted menu and then grab a seat outside in the front yard/deck/patio area.  Had the vegetarian option (vegan po'boy) along with some biscuits and a tea. Great tasting food.    Loved sitting outside (it was around 800p or so) - a big table full of folks across the patio so I just relaxed at one of the counter/stool seats along the sidewalk - nice to just relax and catchup on emails/news/etc.   Crazy but I guess I never noticed that an inside for dining room also - I just assumed it was outdoor dining only.    Customers were walking, biking, and driving to get to the restaurant - which can make a restaurant an interesting people watching experience!   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Blue sky burger is delicious (Even without the bun as I requested) The guys there are super cute, sweet and courteous. I'm visiting from Cali and I most definitely will try to come back before leaving."}
{"text":"Out with my two boys,who, like me, enjoy exploring for great eats. Based on Yelp suggestions, I decided to give this place a shot. It was close to the art museum we were at, reasonable prices, and great food!  It is hard to find food that has great flavor, and makes you feel like you are eating a meal made by momma.  Staff was courteous and ambiance was hip. Thanks for the experience, we are definitely excited to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great but the food etc, but I will say the customer service is pretty bad. Not friendly and they walk around with attitudes. I have been here multiple times and the people are just not friendly. Other than that good food!"}
{"text":"Welcome Diner is perfect, their staff is perfect, slurricanes are perfect. The end."}
{"text":"Ahhhh! The best burger I think I've had! (the champion?) This place has redeemed my first impression of Phoenix! My beloved and I were just passing through. Phoenix was hot (really hot), congested, and filled with erratic drivers, leading to stress and grumpiness. The Welcome Cafe took us in with open arms. Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome people. We laughed and joked with everyone at the bar like they were family. We'd be here at least once a week if we lived here. Well Done!!"}
{"text":"My cute bartender Jesse was the best  The food was amazing as well, get the fish Po'boy!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The big Jim is awesome and the mac and cheese is so good !! Love it"}
{"text":"We went to the Vig first for them to tell us that the kitchen was closed. One of the waiters came out to tell us that there was a restaurant close by with five star food, but not five star appearance. He also told us about a few more in the area, but we decided to try Welcome Diner. Omg, the food was amazingly great, the service was impeccable and the music was awesome, I am so glad we came here I ate everything on my plate"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review because as much as I want success for some of these culinarily perfect grub spots out in Phoenix, I also don't want it to get any busier than it does. I like that they're placed in a neighborhood, it's just a little diner that seems like it's always been there. With the community dining, eclectic patio furniture and the always engaging staff this place really exemplifies what food should be. Good, local and comfortable. It's one of the few...actually ONLY respectable restaurants that I can walk into on a Friday and Saturday at 7pm without a 2 hour wait or calling ahead for a reservation. I hope welcome diner is preserved forever, it's definitely my favorite part of Arizona food culture."}
{"text":"This place is a darn GEM!!!!  Went here last night as I was told they have amazing burgers, and I'm a burger and beer kinda gal, and OH MAN!!  Literally the best burger I have ever had,  finally somewhere in AZ that actually cooks the burger how you order it. Plus they have brewed in az beers to top it all off. It's hidden in a kinda sketchy neighborhood  but the decor within the restaurant makes you feel comfy and the food is so worth it!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was better than acceptable and it was hilarious to see the expression on the window clerk's face when I ordered a Coke and no booze.  She was quite friendly though and the server also was for the most part.  The crowd seemed laid back and content to mind there own beeswax.  I'll definitely hit this joint up again at a later date."}
{"text":"Came here bcuz of the reviews on Yelp. I have had some amaaazing chicken in my life. I can honestly say, I'll always remember this place! The food is simply some of the best I've had-period. It's local, hipster, retro, and just that good!"}
{"text":"Just went back for another Tuesday night dinner...  Romesco Cauliflower Gnocchi Soft Shell Crab Goat Terrine Lamb Loin Chocolate Chip Pecan Pie Olive Oil Cake Butterscotch Brownie Brioche Pudding  Ridiculous. Top five best dinners in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful ambiance. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to eat local food outdoor in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!! We love this place!!!! everything on the menu is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Enticed by the rave reviews, we decided to try this place out. It was ridiculously expensive for what you get. Not great for kids as there are no kids menu options and they wouldn't serve a smaller portion of the $8 mac and cheese \"snack\" when I asked. Also no high chairs or booster seats. My husband had the biscuits and gravy which he said were tasty, but nothing special to warrant the high price. I had a cheeseburger ordered medium rare and fries. The fries were shoestring. Not my favorite, but fries are fries. First bite into the burger and bloody juices exploded in my face and all over. The burger was rare, at best. It was dropping and the bun got instantly soggy. Absolutely disgusting and a turnoff!"}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Burger.  An event of world-historical importance."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Great food, great music jams on the speakers, outdoor patio, late hours, beer... Immensely satisfying biscuits and gravy. Cute Art Deco store front. Everything is perfect in the modern diner way as far as I can tell"}
{"text":"I give a 4.5. This place is just plain cool. Here are the 2 things you need to change:  1) Open earlier than 5 2) Sell glasses of wine instead of just bottles  Other than that, it's always an enjoyable experience. The drinks are good. The hurricane is a sweet and refreshing cocktail, but my favorite is the floricita. I imagine the whiskey-based drinks are just as delicious.  For the food - the biscuit plates are always good, but it's sometimes hard to get myself in the mood for a biscuit plate. When there were rillettes on the menu I was a happy camper - the fat melts on your tongue and the pickled watermelon was the perfect yang to that yin. I have eaten a lot of rillettes and you guys do them well. I would personally like to see more entrees on the menu, and since you serve breakfast, open for breakfast? Or at least lunch... It's the perfect day spot.  Nevertheless, the food is amazing. Great job in the kitchen. Drinks are awesome. Prices great. Fun and social atmosphere, and good walkable location."}
{"text":"Amazing little neon diner with counter with stools inside and a large comfortable patio out, with umbrellas and heaters.  Sitting at the counter is the best, as its fun to chat with the bartender and watch the food being prepared in the tiny kitchen.  Best Old Fashioned ever and burger was specially good as well.  Beignets? Yes! Very fun place to go late night too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went to dinner with a couple friends that have been here and recommended the place. The weather was beautiful so why not enjoy a meal outside. The scenery is beautiful, I love the string lights that hang outside. I ordered the Bumblebee biscuit, it had just the right about of everything on it and the chicken was cooked to perfection. It was phenomenal. I love that the side dish is watermelon, what a great refreshing side. We also got a side of poutine fries that were delicious. It's a little messy and sticky, but totally worth it. I am looking forward to trying more from the menu. The staff is super friendly and great customer service. We got our food in a decent amount of time. I will be returning and recommending this place."}
{"text":"Everyone has their go to places, and this happens to be mine, especially late night when no one else is open.    Every dish I have ever ordered is great, but my favorite thus far happens to be \"The Champion\" which is a burger, with BACON JAM!  Everything about this burger is amazing, but adding a fried egg to it makes it that much better! Another one of my favorites is their, Poutine, fries smothered in gravy. You have to try them.  I often hear people complain about the prices, but I don't mind paying that, as long as the food and staff is amazing, which they are."}
{"text":"Both our plates were wonderful and the staff was friendly. Solid biscuits, chorizo, and a well-cooked egg. My gin and tonic (ordered on a whim) was a bit weak for my taste. 5 stars for a better drink and a cleaner bathroom."}
{"text":"I brought my dad here a couple of weeks ago, just on a whim. I'd been once before when the previous owners still had the place, and I had been itching to go back.   We went for an early lunch so we were able to sit inside. The staff is friendly, and I think my dad enjoyed the fact that every time the waitress turned around, her rear end was right in his face. Dirty old men in close quarters. What can you do?   The food was great- I had the grilled cheese (minus pickles), he had a burger and we both had fries. I loved the grilled cheese- it was perfectly charred- and he had no complaints about the burger, which is a rare thing. The fries were perfection and I may have even dreamed about them that night.   I can't imagine eating here would be too fun in the middle of the summer, as most of the seating is outside, but it's a great little lunch spot, and they're also open late on First Fridays. Good to know, since getting food anywhere else downtown on a First Friday is next to impossible.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews... But this place is an exception!!!!! (I actually created an account just to review this place)  The atmosphere is worth the trip alone, cool set up with outdoor seating (nice lights at night) and a rad mural on the fence. Super cool staff, real friendly!  Anyway, THE FOOD, The food is amazing, I have been traveling the U.S for 2 months and I haven't tasted anything that would come close to this! I had the fried avocado po'boy and a side of Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, I think they were pan fried with oil and some herb, and the po'boy was probably the BEST THING I HAVE EVER EATEN! But seriously, it was delicious, And it's served with diced watermelon on the side, blends nicely, and whoever thought of deep fried avocado is a god dam genius!!!!    I wasn't sure what to expect when I got there, I was just going from the reviews on yelp. And they were right!  So do yourself a favor and head on down to welcome diner and hook in to some of there great food!!!   My only regret is that I leave tomorrow and only got to visit once :("}
{"text":"It's an old train car style diner. The food is amazing, as are the drinks(they make their own tonic and other cocktail ingredients). I am pretty sure that all or most of the food ingredients are bought locally. The wait staff are almost all local artists and musicians(as are a lot of the customers), interesting and friendly people, who are great for striking up a conversation with. The secret ingredient in Welcome Diner is love. Also, children's cough syrup. Anyways, it's an amazing place, get off your duff and go."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. Pick any item on the menu. Have a drink. You will not be disappointed. I don't care what kind of food you like, if you are picky or not, this place is amazing  and will leave you always wondering what the next item on the menu tastes like. Not only is the food stupid good, but every member of the staff is friendly and attentive. Matt is a master behind the bar and if you can't make up your mind he will help you choose something that will change how you view food."}
{"text":"Incredible place. You can tell the owners put a lot of care into their recipes. Seems like they opened it on a budget, since the restaurant is an old, small diner trailer put on a lot in a not-so-great part of town (area has improved dramatically since they started, it's now a decent area). There are some bar seats inside, but the main dining area is a patio. I love the character of this diner. It's unique and friendly.  My biggest complaint is that it could take up to 45 minutes for your food come out depending on how busy they are. However, the patio is a nice place to wait and enjoy drinks while you're waiting. Guessing this is a result of their tiny kitchen in the trailer and I hesitate to mention this complaint, since without that tiny kitchen Welcome Diner wouldn't be what it is."}
{"text":"We visited welcome diner for the first time last night. The food was amazing we tried the fried green tomato sandwich and it was delicious. The service was exceptional and the vibe was super laid back we are a fan and will be back soon to try the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I have had friends telling me about Welcome Diner for years. It is a fantastic and quaint dining spot. The biscuits are delicious and the drinks are tasty. I will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"The Jackfruit BBQ sandwich is the absolute best! I will travel just to eat that again!"}
{"text":"The food here was great, and the servers were attentive.  We were visiting from out of town and the location was not all what we expected; kind of back in a local neighborhood.  But the place itself is lovely.  If we had had more time we would have visited again during our trip, the food was so good :)"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix, and we ate all of our meals at one restaurant - The Welcome Diner. The service is ridiculously pleasant, with various servers casually checking in with you and chatting you up during the meal. Dinner was probably one of the best meals we have ever had- to start: pulled pork fries smothered in tangy BBQ sauce and topped with homemade cool coleslaw. Then the Welcome Burger, which was moan inducing and gone in about 4 bites. We followed this with their summer salad of watermelon, tomato, ginger pickled rinds, and arugula surrounded by a delicious basil cashew pesto. Unbelievably refreshing. To finish we went with the honey drizzled beignets and basically licked the plate clean. Oh and also the cocktails here are amazing - heaven on earth. And we spent about $60 on all of it. Such a ridiculous bargain. Writing this from the lovely shaded patio waiting for our eggs and biscuits to arrive. We might never leave!"}
{"text":"The burgers are delish fries are so good and the staff is friendly and helpful the spot is very hip and the vibe is chill I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The vibe of this place is a very relax feel but the seating arrangement is kind of uncomfortable. Inside on the bar I found to be the most comfortable but is very tight and  tight. Outside, there is a variety of seating but most of the chairs are not dining type of chairs, good for laying out, but not for eating. It is very much like a picnic feel is what they are probably going for with it.   Well onto more important things is the food. Now I admit, I am not a fan of their type of food, so I mostly ate breakfast dishes. Their signature dish is the big Jim. It is a huge, messy, and not the healthiest of dishes but is fairly tasty. The Chicken breast is well done, but the biscuit was kind of dry and the gravy was kind of cold. I have been to so many places and tried so many biscuit and gravy, and no one ever heats up the gravy beside a luke warm temperature. I just don't get it, but anyways, it was luke warm and kind of bland. Most of the taste came from the chicken and bacon really, rest was kind of there.   I also had their welcome breakfast with sausage. Again the biscuit was not flaky or tender in the middle but dry which was a disappointment. Sausage was one of the best I have tasted even though it was swimming in grease. Eggs and potatoes were okay, nothing really inspiring but very greasy also. So this is their basic breakfast dish which I try at different places to see if there is truly something different about the place. Nothing stood out, but the sausage.   All in all I have to give them a 3 star, the quality and execution of the food does not deserve a 4 star and definitely they are not that creative or their food is so much different  and outstanding that it deserve a 5 star. They are definitely a high 3 star, and I would go back, would unlikely right away or on a consistent basis, but once in a while is definitely in the cards."}
{"text":"We LOVE Welcome Diner! The dishes never disappoint, whether you opt for a biscuit sandwich, a burger, or a daily special. Definitely check the seasonal hours just to ensure you're going for the right meal. While we love the burgers, we prefer winter hours with breakfast and the killer coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Mac and Cheese with Chicken and the Biscuits and Gravy with fried chicken. Both were hands down the amazing!! The restaurant is unique looking and has mainly outdoor seating. A great place with character and its open late. A MUST TRY while you are in the Phoenix Downtown Area."}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner here with my girlfriend. The environment is very hipster, small area, not crowded, and clean. Price was fair, just like any other restaurant.   The service was outstanding. Very friendly and very courteous. I've worked in customer service for many years, and these guys sure know how to deliver quality service.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and worth the drive if you're not from the area. Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. Fresh, local ingredients which makes this place even more awesome!!! Service is super friendly and the ambiance is very chill-like you're in an old friends back yard! We ordered the big Jim, fish po boy, and the poutine...if we weren't so full we would have ordered seconds!!! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks, and wonderful service. Not a lot of seating inside, though. Makes it mostly a non-summer place."}
{"text":"Oh my, I just have to say that this place is a knock your socks kind of meal.  I had the Big Jim, the flavor and and taste is insane..... This reminds me of one of those spots you run into in California.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed...."}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere! Small diner-car walk up with lighted outdoor seating. The PB&B burger was amazing, and my wife had a sort of fried chicken biscuit sandwich that she loved. Our cocktails were yummy too! Pretty pricey though! Be prepared to drop at least $40 for 2 people, $50 with booze."}
{"text":"Was very happy here . I travel a bunch for work, so I haven't been able to check our many new places . This place is a hidden gem that I don't believe will remain hidden for very long . I can't believe I was able to get one of the best classic margaritas I've ever had for $7 at happy hour . Food service was a little slow but I expect that will improve in time . Food was tasty and simple with classics."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.So relaxed. Burger was super delicious. Fries could have used a bit more crispiness. The ginger beer is made in house and is sweet, sharp, and very gingery, one of the best I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix for business and since eating by yourself is not fun....I wanted a local spot to enjoy dinner.  And oh boy did I find a GREAT spot.  Welcome Diner provides a unique atmosphere and the weather was awesome.    I highly recommend the KoKo - Chicken Biscuit Sandwich with a creamy spicy sauce, fried chicken, arugula, tomato and some other stuff with a side of watermelon.  Absolutely delicious!!!  I also treated myself to the Beignets which were so good and I wish I could have finished them all but I was stuffed.  And get a Hurricane; fresh and perfect too!  Staff was great, friendly and if I am back in Phoenix again, I will definitely come back to the Welcome Diner!"}
{"text":"A true delight with a short and thoughtful menu filled with well prepared grub."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went for some late night chow after a show. Service was great food was soooooooo good! I had the delicious best ever vegetarian jackfruit sandwich and my friend had the Mac n cheese. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Very unique diner with a variety of different salads. The ingredients are always fresh, and the quality is apparent from the first bite."}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming but it will punch you in the life with deliciousness! I just think about the biscuits and the gravy and the chicken! I have only gotten my food to go because we have several kids and it looks like a cool place for date night. The hours are hard to remember. But it's yum!"}
{"text":"Called them on 2 occasions to place a to-go order and they did not pick up their phone."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had the fried chicken on a biscuit sandwiches  one was with the sausage gravy - and the other was the  buffalo one both very good. We had the Hurricanes also very tasty. Definitely going to be on our list of favorites!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place that is so off the beaten path that you need to drive down a neighborhood road to get to it. Well this is the place. Great food, friendly owners and a diner you will want to come back to."}
{"text":"Food is good - hours are great...  little pricy but I walked away full.   Not my every night choice since two of us cost 45$ but a great once and a while place for late night snacking"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and we weren't disappointed. The staff was very friendly and attentive, the food was excellent and the drinks were tasty. Topping it off was the outdoor seating and the crowd, a perfect Arizona night on our road trip through the area."}
{"text":"Their red bean and rice are fabulous and the portion is super generous!  I also had the Kentucky Thoroughbred cocktail and it was amazing.  There's something about sitting knee to knee with strangers at a nine-person diner counter talking about food and life and watching the chef's work in the teensy-tiny kitchen.  But don't worry - if you need some space and want to enjoy the amazing AZ weather there's a HUGE patio and fun little order window... something for everyone!  For dessert I got the homemade biscuit with goat cheese and apple butter.  The biscuit was warm but the cheese was cold and that was a weird combination.  But overall everything was delicious and I will totally be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a po boy sandwich and a pie and they forgot the blue berry sauce that goes on it. If you're going to blow the order at least try or want to fix the problem not say my bad. After coming back twice on the phone and not being able to resolve the issue you've lost a customer especially if I'm going to spend 20.00 plus and even tip on a to go order. Next time attempt to replace and coach your staff."}
{"text":"So excited this diner opened. It's a neighborhood diner in a historic district.  Awesome food and great service. Small bar seating inside and patio outside. Had the catfish on Friday for like $12 with a little bit of watermelon pieces on the side.  Catfish was a great portion well worth the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a quaint little spot.  Can be confusing to order, but we figured it out.  The food was delicious!  After a concert it hit the spot!  My only dislike was bottled soda...I just love a glass of ice.  If I'm in the neighborhood I will come back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here late one evening on a whim with my work peeps. Delicious, unique, delicious. We sat outside in august- only downfall. Looking fwd to going back in the fall."}
{"text":"Chose this diner because of all the rave reviews and wasn't disappointed! Five stars for atmosphere, five stars for the awesomeness of food, and five stars for the friendliness of staff. Try it out for yourself, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The welcome diner is such a cool dive! I love that it's one of the few places serving awesome food at night. The outdoor seating and lighting is perfect to come hang out with a bunch of friends. One time I accidentally tipped them $100, which was TOTALLY embarrassing, because my card company texted me asking if it was a fraudulent transaction. They were cool and we laughed about it, but if I was wealthier I would definitely have tipped them $100 because it's a great place. :) Their mac n' cheese is bomb. Check this fine establishment out."}
{"text":"Overcharged drinks. Specifically asked if a whiskey and soda would be the same price as a gin and tonic... ended up 4 dollars more. 8 dollar whiskey and soda the whiskey and sour ended up being 18 dollars. Total should have been  14 bucks. After asking the mgr what had happened, he explained that since it was house made ginger soda, it's a 4 dollar extra charge. Ended up just settling the tab and then my girlfriend ordered me a drink. Half a hour later and everyone at the table has their drink... Except me. Asked the manager again what was going on and it ended up in a verbal altercation with him. The summary of the argument was that I asked for my drink, then the whiskey and soda was brought up by him again. Eventually just let him know that I will be posting a review on google due to his behavior. Quote unquote response from the manager \"Google? Never heard of it.\". Keep in mind this is with a whole line of guests behind me and they're listening pretty intently by this point.  Waited a couple more mins, my girlfriend at this point just goes to get the money back. Guests behind definitely took note as their first question \"was the service that bad?\" Yes. Yes, it was.   Childish at best. Will not frequent this location again. What sucks is that I've been going here since they were running out of the food truck years and years ago."}
{"text":"Get the BIG JiM. Biscuits and gravy with fried chicken, bacon and cheese. Basically everything amazing into one dish. I took off one star for the wacky hours and lack of (good) seating"}
{"text":"I had a great time dining at this place. Loved the casualness of the establishment. Order from the walk up window and the food gets delivered to your outdoor patio table. The food was comfort, with a twist for the better.  Opens late and serves beer & spirits. I can see why this is a local spot that's gone mainstream.  No doubt, a great hidden gem of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Phoenix! Even if this establishment wasn't within walking distance from my house I would drive 50 miles for the Chicken biscuit sandwiches and amazing burgers they serve. The service is outstanding, the ambiance is mellow, friendly, and casual. A perfect place for a first date, group gathering, or drinks with friends. The hours are phenomenal (they are open super late or super early). Check them out!"}
{"text":"Went here during first friday and it was a madhouse. I'm assuming things run a little smoother when the line isn't out the door so I give them the benefit of the doubt. Food is amazing all the way!"}
{"text":"Lurvvv this place and their artichoke mac. Also cute and quaint with a hip vibe."}
{"text":"Coolest place downtown! I'm sure them staying open for food until 2am has something to do with it. My sister and I shared a burger after a concert and it was so good we wanted more! Next time we will not share, that's for sure! Thanks guys for working so hard at 2am at night while everyone else is having a good time! We were so thankful you were open because we were starving! Awesome place and great food, will recommend to everyone and can't wait to go back and try the fries with gravy!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place...the food is mostly locally sourced...it's fresh...tasty...reasonably priced...outdoor seating available...a laid back vibe...started by 5 friends with varying artistic talents...very friendly and accommodating..."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! It's like a permanent food truck/ diner combo with plenty of outdoor seating. Strung up lights and eclectic furniture help create a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. Most important, however, is the fact that everyone working here is nice, attentive, and helpful in providing drink & food recommendations. I can personally recommend their old fashioned, house made ginger beer, biscuits, poutine or pulled pork fries, and watermelon salad. Oh and the slaw on the pulled pork fries and some of the biscuits is amazing! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Excellent service! Superb food! I see myself spending lots of time here with friends and/or family. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I have eaten at in Phoenix, at the recommendation of a local, and it really set the tone of the rest of our food-ventures here in Phoenix.  the ATMOSPHERE is amazing. You drive up to this old, tiny diner with a variety of seating in front of it, and strings of lights hung up around the eating area. The vibe is very chill and feels like a funky neighborhood joint. You definitely feel at home, and I love that everyone feels welcome.   When ordering your FOOD you go up to a tiny window of the trailer and after find a seat. Once your food is ready, they call your name and bring your food over to your table. I was deciding between the Bumblebee biscuit sandwich and the Fried Green tomato sandwich. The guy at the counter said I should try the green tomato sandwich, so I did. AND IT WAS AWESOME.  It is seriously  a perfect combination of the crispy battered tomato plus the sweet corn and the savory spread and the crunchy sourdough bringing it all together. Such a genius sandwich! We also shared a poutine which was just gravy and yellow cheese (just different than other poutine that I have had). The gravy tasted really homemade and delicious.  The SERVICE was great. Everyone was friendly and very laid back and they really made you feel at ease.  I would say that the ONLY NEGATIVE is that once you get your food, the flies immediately sense it and are all over it. It just gets annoying, but it's not like anyone can control mother nature."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled cheese at 5:15 pm with 6 people there.  Took a longer than expected, but was super tasty by the time we got it at 5:45.  The whole menu looks really good."}
{"text":"They have limited non alcoholic beverages. So if you want a Diet Coke, best bring your own.  The food took awhile. If it wasn't so dang good, I would have been mad. Lol. We ordered the bumble bee with the mustard on the side. Omg!!! It was actually delicious!! The chicken was crispy the biscuit was soaked in honey. It was awesome. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and yummy. The poutine was good (nothing out of this world but good). The big Jim was delicious and savory but not as delicious as the bumblebee. The beignets were thicker than what I'm accustomed to but so so good. I'd get everything I ordered again. It was all superb.   As soon as I burn off these calories, I'm coming back! It just might take me a couple of weeks"}
{"text":"Wife and I just flew in to Arizona and stopped here because our flight got in around 10pm and this place was nearby Sky Harbor and open late (kitchen open until 2am).   Ordered the Welcome Burger, medium well, raw onions, no pickles (because they were bread and butter pickles and I don't like those). It came with a choice of side and I picked fries.   The burger was FAN. FRIGGIN. TASTIC. I can say the same for the fries. My wife tried both and agreed with my enthusiasm. In fact, I can say without exaggeration that this was easily one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had in my 30 years of life. Can't speak highly enough of the burger and also the fries. We'll definitely be coming back here on our way to the airport before leaving Arizona."}
{"text":"This place puts out some darn good quality food and in BIG portions for the price! I got the pulled pork bbq biscuit which was huge and so flavorful. My husband got the bumblebee which was a biscuit sandwich with extra crispy fried chicken, honey, and mustard. He said he loved it, but not before he finished it because he didn't want to let me have a taste. We also shared the macaroni and cheese, sooooo creamy with great texture and crunch factor on top! Plus, we got to add chorizo which made that dish my husband's all time fave. My favorite was the pouting fries that we shared. Gaahhhhhh lee that is comfort food at BEST! I'm a ketchup girl but these fries hit all the right notes without any added condiments. The only con about this place is that seating is outdoors. The entire time my husband and I were fighting off flies and picking out debris falling from the tree from our food (it got really windy.) I'm sure the ambiance is much better when the weather isn't so annoying, but this was kind of a turn off for us. However, the food was SO worth fighting a fly army. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing and the jackfruit dishes are wonderful. I wish they had more vegan options and more inside seating but this is a super tiny diner so you have to take this into consideration. They make their own tonic water for gin and tonics, oh myyy!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late nite bite. Although nobody called us dude (sir) it was only because we were old enough to be everyone's parents. No matter, the service was enthusiastic and personal, the food delicious, the atmosphere authentically hipster. I had the fried green (red) tomato sandwich which was positively nuclear, the way I like it. Health food no doubt. What a great place. Wish we could have had some drinks because they had interesting ones, but my companion had Hurricane Juice and said it was the best juice he ever had. A mix of fresh juices would definitely benefit from rum."}
{"text":"FUN! FUN! FUN! GOOD! GOOD! GOOD! Need I say more? OPEN late 2am even during the week. Good food and low prices. Really can't beat that combination! A little bit of a sketchy neighborhood, but safe enough. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Drinks and food were delicious. We had the little birdy and the pork fries. Yummy! Their hurricane drinks are the best. We also had an old fashioned and whisky sour. Bartender (Zack) was very friendly. Very small inside diner type seating and lots of outdoor tables. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great home cooked food. The watermelon salad with pickled rind and goats cheese is a gluten free DELIGHT!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Sedona Az from LA Ca, stopped by in Phoenix to grab a bite. Came across the Welcome diner on yelp & was intrigued by the retro / hipster look & did my food research . Definitely recommend the Champion burger   like many others on here. You will not be disappointed! My lady bug ordered the Mac n cheese & loved it. Overall an amazing spot to get a quick bite and just hangout outdoors. Would come back when in Phoenix for sure.   Oh & all staff were masters of their crafts without a doubt."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMMMOOOOOO! I've been wanting to go for a while.  I wasn't disappointed at all with my Big Jim ~ fried chicken, sausage gravy, cheddar & bacon!  Other orders in the group was the Carol~ kiltlifter  braised pork, carolina bbq sauce and coleslaw & Sunrise~ bacon, andouille, fried egg, cheddar, arugula & aioli.   I want to go back very soon... so many things sound like I need to try them."}
{"text":"This place is unanimously beloved by my friends and I. If I ever have friends visiting from out of town, I always take them here for great drinks and delicious food. My go-to drink is Whisky Sour and my go-to food item is the Little Birdy- MUST TRY! Either the Litte Birdy, or the Big Jim if you are extra hungry."}
{"text":"I saw this place a few times passing by, but never thought to stop by until I saw it on Check, Please Arizona. I went out with family to give it a taste. We shared a No Way José burger, beignets with local honey and powdered sugar, and a biscuit with preserves and goat cheese.  Let me tell you first of all: if you come here complaining about the wait, just remember that good food AIN'T fast food. Be patient and your patience will be rewarded! Every morsel of that food was delicious. The biscuit reminded me of breakfast at Grandma's house. That burger was juicy and full of flavor; even the bread was good. The beignets were warm,  crispy, chewy, and paired well with the local honey; finger-lickin good.  That was a good little taste, but I definitely wanna come back and try some more.  Get the ginger beer, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is darling. The patio is gorgeous with lots of comfy, welcoming, and uplifting touches. The service is always upbeat, fun, and inviting and the food... holy moly. I'll gladly gain a few pounds for you Welcome Diner.   If you want to go somewhere different, escape this silly life for a moment, and enjoy a delicious beverage I highly recommend you stroll over to this diner, order yourself a \"Hurricane\" and find a seat on the patio where you can relax while the desert sun sets. In fact, I just might head over there all by my onsies tonight. Yes, I'm going to drink alone. I'm ok with it.   Everything I've ever ordered off their menu has been delicious. They have lots of southern food options and they change up their specials menu about once a week. Anything you order will be divine. I promise you. Don't question me, I have the pounds to prove it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the neatest places I've been to, from food to atmosphere! Been here several times with friends and my fiancé, and we haven't been disappointed. My go-to item on the menu has been the fried green tomato sandwich (a waiter suggested I added bacon to make it a BLT, and I LOVE it)! Crispy bread, zesty corn relish... it's awesome!  Last night, we tried a new menu item: the jambalaya.  I've been to New Orleans a few times and tried cajun restaurants across Phoenix (unfortunately, few can get those flavor profiles right). But this jambalaya? Damn! I think cajun-foodies will be extremely pleased! The taste is like homemade New Orleans cooking, yet the dish is still unique. It's a lil smokey, a lil spicy, and super flavorful. I hope they keep it on the menu, because I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Amidst a dusty, but up and coming neighborhood, there's a corner of red paint and light which is Welcome Diner. Love the quaintness and the neighborhood feel (I'm worried they will lose some of their charm when they move locations). Arrived on a Saturday night and there was such limited seating; the place was packed! Ordered their arugula and watermelon salad: fresh and tasty, but honestly, not worth the hype. Also tried the \"Koko\" and the \"Carol\". The Koko is a fried chicken sandwich with a chipotle ranch sauce-good and a bit spicy! The Carol was better; pulled pork topped with somewhat spicy coleslaw--this dish was a great, complexity of flavors that melded well together. Will have to return to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Love the biscuts, love the bacon, love the people & of course love the hurricane. Welcome diner has a kicked back attitude & comfort food that's oh so yummy in my tummy. My only wish for summer is that they had more indoor seating. I'm looking forward to the rumored slip n slide though. Can't wait to get back again. Thanks Welcome Diner!"}
{"text":"I love this place and am proud to support their business. I feel the love and hard work they put into everything they do when I eat there; it comes through in the consistent and soul-satisfying food because of they people they hire and continue to empower. So proud to have this little, amazing place representing the culinary culture in Phoenix and Arizona."}
{"text":"Good Food, fun atmosphere. Happy Hour is great, Love to come here late at night"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite diner in AZ. Such a friendly staff! And the Hurricanes... BEST DRINK omg! This place is a must if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here at the end of a First Friday, and it was worth the wait in line. Fun atmosphere and delicious food. Jack fruit fries and Mac&Cheese were great. The guy taking my order was super nice. I was stuck between the Mac&Cheese and the brussel sprouts, and he informed me that he could request the kitchen folk to mix the brussel sprouts into the Mac&Cheese. I went with that, and it was heavenly. Would definitely return and bring others with me."}
{"text":"I recently moved to downtown and this was a spot that all my friends said to check out. It did not disappoint. I got the big Jim biscuit for dinner which came with a generously sized portion of fried chicken and plenty of gravy. I also ordered the Mac n cheese. I do not advise you should order both if you are eating alone. Simply not enough space in a human stomach.  The staff was very friendly and while they were only moderately busy service was very prompt. There is plenty of parking on the street. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, drinks are delicious!  Only detractors are the 90% outside seats meaning a battle w flies and the occasional monster truck.  Kid friendly - we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So I've been hearing about this place for a while.  I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.  It took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.  We arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.  It was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.  The beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.  The husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.  We also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.  And then I crashed in a delicious food coma."}
{"text":"For some reason, when I think of iconic parts of Phoenix, Welcome Diner comes to mind. The place itself for me feels nostalgic. Anyone visiting downtown Phoenix has got to stop by."}
{"text":"We came here with my brother and sister in laws they came into town late at night and this place was  the only place open where we could chill and have good food.. everyone loved it my husband and I had the burger it was very unique we definitely will be coming back forget IHOP and come to welcome diner!!"}
{"text":"OH!  MY!  GOD!  I don't understand how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars... Food is incredible, staff are friendly and welcoming, and the drinks are delicious, especially the Hurricane. I had the Carrie pulled pork sandwich and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever had. EVER!  Don't listen to these winey bitches who give three stars... They obviously don't understand good food and good service. Would eat here every day if I didn't live so far away. Wow"}
{"text":"I went on a late night Thursday and ordered the poutine fries. This has been on my list of places to try for some time. The food was great, huge plate and a good price point. I didn't have a drink. I had to use the restroom and it was teeeeny tiny and kind of dirty, not a fan of that. Other than that it's a good place to chat with friends, we sat outside and it was really cold but the heaters were not on."}
{"text":"The guy who served us here was so kind and attentive to us.  They have homemade ginger beer which, IF you like that kind of thing, is very good!  The menu is pretty limited because it's a VERY small space but we all had some biscuit sandwiches and they were really nice!  Hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Got there at around midnight. Waited patiently to order the famous chicken biscuit sandwiches and poutin fries.  Unfortunately they were completely out of fried chicken and gravy.  Our bad luck turned into good luck because we had to go with other options.  Turns out the po boys and burgers are amazing!  Don't be afraid to go outside of your ordering comfort zone here.  Don't guzzle your drink too quickly,  it takes a while to get your food after you order.  It's well worth the wait though, and the people watching & music make the time go by faster.  We will return!  Now we're craving that fried chicken and gravy even more.  We will get there earlier on future visits.  Btw open till 2am with full bar.  Btw don't fear sitting next to strangers,  picnic style table seating on a first come first serve basis."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food, great atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the food is a bit pricey.  But don't let that stop you from trying it at least once. (Though I think if you go once, you'll go back. ;)"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and I never stopped cuz all the hipsters, but so glad I took a nice stroll from mi amigas casa to do so bcus this place is super. I got the eggplant parm special. The breading for the eggplant was on point but I realized I'm not a fan of soggy bread so that kills it cuz you need the sauce. Supper yummy sandy though! I also tried the Bumble Bee. It is served on a biscuit (so warm/so soft) fried chix w/a bourbon mustard sauce, mmmm bread and butter pickles and sits in honey all fancy. This is a tasty eat....although be warned the mustard saucy is a tad kicky w/the bourbon, was a suprise for me! Anyways so worth going, open late and I love eating outside picnic table style."}
{"text":"Just an awesome place to eat and chill with friends or  bring your family for a late dinner for outdoor seating :) all food choices are unique and absolutely delicious. You have to try the biscuit sandwiches!! Their gravy is like no other! I loved it and I'm not a big gravy fan."}
{"text":"Fabulous jack fruit po boy, and fried green tomato sandwich. This is also one of my favorite spots for cocktails!"}
{"text":"Love welcome diner!  The PB&B (Peanut Butter and Bacon) burger is absolutely delicious (if you like Peanut butter of course). The meat is always cooked very well, the ingredients fresh, and a great mix of flavors.  Also on my favorite list is Poutine Fries. Fries, topped with Gravy."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend got the pb&b burger and no way Jose a couple days ago and wow these burgers are hands down the best we ever had and the coleslaw was awesome props to the cooks!"}
{"text":"Just left an awesome dinner at Welcome Diner. Staff is beyond friendly, and the food was delicious. We're new to Phoenix, and we'll definitely be back often. Thanks yall!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I got the fried chicken macaron & no way Jose burger. To drink I got the Hurricane. Everything so good!!!"}
{"text":"The pulled Jack Fruit was magnificent! Super convenient and a nice home feel."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, and reasonable prices - especially for happy hour. Only complaint is the atmosphere - being right by a street with cars whizzing by isn't the ideal vibe. Overall though, great place! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Order one of everything, I insist. Worry about the pocket change later. You're welcome, in advance."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was so delicious! Everyone that worked there was extremely friendly and outgoing. Only downside is the restaurant is outside and very minimal seating inside. Other than that, it's a great place to eat in downtown phoenix!"}
{"text":"I took my coworkers to the new location last night before a comedy show. We live on the northwest side so aren't able to get downtown often. I was actually worried that the new location would not have the same character as the old location....well it absolutely does. When we arrived the place was full besides the bar, so we sat at the bar which is actually an open kitchen and we were able to watch the cooking of all of the food which we enjoyed. The Paloma cocktail was so good! I love tequila and grapefruit so it was a great combination. I ordered the big Jim for my meal. It was a biscuit with fried chicken, gravy and cheddar aka heart attack on a plate but so well worth it.  I feel like the service was much better this time around and the food came out fresh and fast.My coworkers and I really enjoyed our meal and will go back when downtown again."}
{"text":"Best night out possible! Cocktails are all hand crafted perfectly.  Staff is super passionate and proud of the product.  My boyfriend loves the peanut butter burger and I had the fried green tomato sandwich.  The corn relish with the fried tomato made me wish for a jar to take home and have at with a spoon."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Outdoor seating under stringed lights was neat.  Food was ok.  If you are in the mood for unhealthy food, go for it."}
{"text":"Great burgers, but we waited 45 minutes to get our food ... That's crazy.  Kitchen is way too small, and service people were friendly but clueless."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in downtown! The poutine was wonderful, great ambience, the bumble bee biscuit was out of this world! If you've never been here, you're cheating yourself"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am fairly certain that I would give it 5 stars if I wasn't a vegetarian.  My meat loving pals are obsessed with the Big Jim (best fried chicken sandwich smothered in gravy, topped with bacon and cheese)--even makes me want to give up morals for a bite!    The folks behind the counter are always super friendly and chill.  They have drink specials and daily food specials that are mouthwatering!  I love the vegan poboy.  Fried avocado like no other!    I think I might be biased, but I do love me some Welcome Diner (but I can't eat here too much or I'll end up as big as a house!)"}
{"text":"Okay so I went to Welcome Diner this morning after seeing my friends IG post of his food a week ago. Met a friend and we sat inside was greeted by the entire staff including Wayne and Justin the Cook, our server was super cool too. Ordered the Sunrise Sandwich- A Biscuit for a bun with scrambled eggs, Cheese, Arugala and per the recommendation of our server added Chorizo....BOMB DOT COM I can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu...just go and eat it's worth it!."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. Their food is out of this world. Im a vegetarian and they have so many options for me. My favorite things on the menu are: Mac n cheese with Brussel sprouts and the jack fries. Their fried green tomato sandwich is phenomenal as well.  I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"[Other reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix]  THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE  When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.  We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.  (PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)  Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.  The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.  THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.  MOZZARELLA The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.  GNOCCHI If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.    LEMON CURD We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.  $62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.  I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May,  June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! We had the veggie burger and the Welcome Burger. Both were amazing! The fried avocado was out of this world.   We will definitely be going back. I highly recommend this unique little gem in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Definitely a great spot for a comfort food fix...with a twist. We tried the happy hour menu and were impressed that the portions were huge! On our list to try was the \"Little Birdy,\" \"poutine fries,\" and \"jackfruit BBQ fries.\" That hit crunchy, hearty and unusually delicious - really though we accidentally got an order of the regular pork BBQ fries when we tried the jackfruit. The service was fast and friendly. We loved the laid back atmosphere accented by the neon light of the diner. You HAVE TO check this spot out!"}
{"text":"I had always heard of this place and finally decided to come and check it out. I had a busser greet me and welcome me in because I was a dinner. I had a cashier give me a quick run down on how the restaurant works, the chefs finished my meal in a timely manner, and the dish washer did a great job on cleaning my plate and utensils. If there's something that can make me loose my appetite and make me not even bother touching the my food is seeing old food from a previous customer still on my plate and silverware.   I got the No Way Jose burger which was delicious but small.  I finished it in 5 bites."}
{"text":"So loved this quirky little diner.  Ate here last night and everything was DELISH!    I had the fried chicken sandwich , man oh man chicken doesn't get crunchier than that!  Also had a gin tonic made with their small batch tonic syrup.  My boyfriend had an amazing burger and as thought that wasn't enough we shared the Mac & cheese, so light and airy, wonderful.  If you are on a diet his is not the place to visit lol. But, if you want amazing comfort food at a great price you've found your spot."}
{"text":"I live for their jackfruit fries. A little pricy but worth it, especially if you can make happy hour."}
{"text":"Updating my review for Welcome Diner after having been there a few times now! I will admit that if it weren't for my boyfriend who decided after the first time that he loved it, I probably wouldn't have gone back.  Anyways - I'm a huge fan of their fries, first and foremost. I get them every time. They're the thinner shoestring variety & come with a different kind of delicious creamy dipping sauce, rather than just ketchup. You can get them topped with jackfruit, pulled pork, or poutine. With one of the toppings, it's basically the size of a meal.  I also really like the bumblebee sandwich. The fried chicken is one of the best and it tastes great on their biscuit with some honey!  My boyfriend swears by the jackfruit po'boy & for good reason. It's really a tasty vegetarian option, which is commonly difficult to find at most places. While he's not vegetarian, it's his go-to option, and the first time he had it, he said that it tasted very similar to pulled pork!  Also, if you're a fan of fish, try out the fish po'boy. The tarter sauce that comes on it is smooth & creamy and balances out the tart coleslaw. My favorite part about it is that it's much lighter than the fried chicken.  They open later on in the day and are open until 2am. It's our #1 choice for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"Incredible. I traveled to pheonix for the weekend and ate here late-night twice. Maybe it was the condition I was in after a concert, but I believe this is the best burger I've ever had. Excellent patio too-- a real hipster's delight. GO HERE NOW"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars, due to the delicious, unusual food options, as well as the ambiance that made me jump through time to yesteryear and relive memories that never happened but that I always wished had happened."}
{"text":"Been here two times now for comic con rest place to chill and yummy food ! Burgers and smothered frys"}
{"text":"We ate lunch there on a weekday in early 10/04.  The Welcome is a restored 1930s diner and seating consists of just nine (counter) seats.  It's definitely cramped, but that means you'll get to converse with your neighbors.  The menu is quite limited, although the food was good.  However, they don't give you plates and the food was *very* greasy (our sandwiches came on a piece of waxed paper and the grease quickly soaked through the paper onto the counter).  The other thing I didn't like, was that you had to *buy* (bottled) water if that was your drink of choice.  They had a cook, a helper and a waitress working in a VERY tiny space....the waitress was o.k., but the cook and helper were pretty friendly.  It seemed that everyone but us was a \"regular\", which was kind of fun; we had an amusing conversation with the three guys (co-workers) who sat nearest us."}
{"text":"We are from Oakland, the land of hipster restaurants. This one is super cool and the nighttime weather in Phoenix makes sitting outside that much better than the cold nights of Oakland. The food was amazing. I had their bumblebee biscuit, watermelon salad, and homemade fruit punch. It was all more than delicious and was extremely fresh. The ambiance really sets it apart and makes the whole experience worth it. Theres something about eating good food on a warm evening, sitting at a picnic table under twinkie lights, an catching up with friends that really makes an verage night special and memorable. Thanks Welcome Diner. The staff are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Really amazing food and generous portions! I used to come to here with my boyfriend for burgers since it's right next to my house, but then we decided to go vegetarian because of pollution, cruelty, health ect. and had to stop eating here because their were hardly any veggie options and we were never given a straight answer about whether any of the products were local. Vegetables aside, this place is definitely worth going to if you want good food and want to meet great people."}
{"text":"I finally get a chance to taste \"the bumble bee\" that I've seen on the yelp tease pics. Why did it have to be so good? I'm supposed to be 80% gluten free gosh darn! I'm going to have to increase my weekly indulgences to 2 1/2 because Phoenix makes being good very difficult. I'll say the mustard competes with the pickles, but doesn't mess up the sandwich. Oh do these people know exactly what they are doing with the honey on top! Honey and pickles on one sandwich together in perfect harmony (swoon). Chik-fool-a can kiss my diversity after this sandwich. Not that I've eaten there since --you know-- but it was something to miss. My sister had the \"big Jim\" and man is that a lot of gravy. Nothing was wrong in that sandwich other than ordering it with a side which would make you glutton of the year. (She ordered the Mac n'cheese with it and I hope she never reads this).  Don't do it, your stomach can only expand so much! To conclude: yum."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I want to totally love this, but frankly, Phoenix is still missing the traditional diner, even when it's housed in an authentic diner. I was hoping this would be the epic college hang-out, but it's too expensive for that. An 8 buck burger is three dollars away from a night out for a collegiate. 5 bucks for a 12 oz plastic cup pour, even a good draft, is still not in that ballpark. Actually, it's close to ballpark pricing. Knock off at least a buck.  And 4 dollars for a very small portion of collard greens will not bring me back to eat it.  I ordered the most expensive meal because I wanted the food experience. Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.  Three items and with tip, over $28.00.  This falls into the realm of special event for me, and that's a shame as the folks running the kitchen, taking orders, owners are ALL great and the service was really casual yet efficient.  I would love to see something like a whiskey and soda for $4.00, discounted pitchers of beer, maybe even a discount for bringing in your own coffee cup or dishes as there really is a lot of plastic waste coming out of there.  Sure, I'll be back, and for what it is(an amazing restoration of a wonderful place with a killer patio)I'm glad it's here. I'll have whatever is on special now, and skip the sides, though the fries with gravy could be killer with cheese curds a la  poutine.   Yet still I wait for the college hang-out."}
{"text":"I love the Welcome Diner  Most of what we had was awesome. I'd been having day dreams of the PB + B burger (no cheese), and it was everything I hoped for. Nice burger cooked a perfect medium rare. So glad they went with chunky PB, and loads of it  We split the Welcome fries topped with Kiltlifter braised pulled pork and housemade Carolina BBQ sauce. Was exactly what you'd expect, nothing fancy, but really tasty  The only miss was the Fried Avacado. Plain and flavorless, really just a vehicle for a nice dipping sauce. Now, if they did a fried chunky spicy onion heavy guacamole, they might have something  Also have been in for brunch, and the Holy Puerco is amazing"}
{"text":"My expectations got dumped on after I came to Welcome Diner. We came for some passable late night grub. Instead we got kickass grub and some really nice drinks.  Of course we come on a Tuesday - clearly the best day because it was happy hour all day. Between my group we had a Hurricane, Gin and Tonic, Whiskey Sour, a Little Birdy, and an order of Poutine.  Happy hour drinks at $5-6, you don't expect much. But these staples actually hold their own against bars that would sell theirs for $10+. The gin and tonic was refreshing with the addition of lime juice. The Whiskey Sour had a nice balanced tart flavor from the fruit. And the Hurricane was basically alcoholic juicy goodness.  From the food, literally comfort food at its finest. The Little Birdy - that in house biscuit, plus that awesome succulent fried chicken and slice of cheese - some of the best $5 I've ever spent. And the Poutine is glorious. Probably some of the most conservative, it's close to the traditional sense of just gravy and cheese, but they opt to use a peppery country style gravy and cheddar cheese. It's makes you feel a little worse and better at the same time.  The fact that this place is basically in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood actually added to the appeal for me. It's a bright spot with outdoor seating that makes you want to have a good time. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Cool diner, poutine is good but shredded cheese and white gravy is very non traditional."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and liked both experiences.  It's a cool little hip little diner: nothing fancy.  I have not been on the inside, but I like the outside tables a lot because I brought my dog both times.  I had the chicken sandwich with honey (it's name escapes me, but it had something to do with bees), and the buffalo chicken sandwich on my second visit.  My sister had some kind of a grit cake that was awesome and my mom had pulled pork with slaw - all were on a home made biscuit.  Unless you are really hungry, you might choose to share.  we also had house made ginger beer (delightful) and lemonade.  Great little place."}
{"text":"Great little spot with wonderful fries and biscuit sandwiches. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the No Way Jose medium rare and it was unbelievably delicious- Gouda, beef, arugula, muenster, and some 'charred jalapeño relish'. Could've easily devoured a second one, it was that good.    Liked the chill atmosphere and the staff were all super friendly.  When I next pass through Phoenix you better believe I'm hitting this place up again!"}
{"text":"Love this place..i love the casual outdoor setting that is especially nice as the temperature dips. The menu is full of great items but I'm a sucker for the bumblebee biscuit. The mac and cheese is always a hit and the added options like chorizo can give it more kick. Great beverages and my preferred cocktail would be the hurricane drink. Can't wait to go again and again"}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch once....it's the shit.   They had me with the \"ATTENTION BALLERS, no $50 or $100 BILLS, PLEASE\"  (I'll post a picture)  Basically my kind of place already.   It's a tiny place inside thus the 4 stars but they have a nice patio area with benches, tables and ect.   Food is like some concoction of amazingness. I can't even remember what I had, but it was tasty and full of god knows what, pretty much everything and anything one can think of. They also sell beers and stuff.   It's located in the garfield district right off roosevelt.   I heard it was once a food truck that parked and now it rests.   Go here for something awesome and different."}
{"text":"What can I say? Mostly EVERYTHING here is housemade, and to die for. Its some seriously unhealthy southern diner food but my oh my, it is delicious. The only caviot is that the hurricanes and other drinks don't seem near as strong as they used to."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Pros: loved the atmosphere, the ambiance, and the food.  It was downtown fun and hipster.  The food I ordered, fried green tomato sandwich and the big Jim, were very flavorful and tasty!  Con's: Big Jim needed more gravy!  It was so good but after 2 bites the gravy was gone and I was left with dry biscuit on awesome fried chicken. So the two bites I had...great!  The rest....a little dry.  And I hate to say it, but it took 45 minutes to get our food, 30 to get a single drink order.  This killlllss me!! Buuut it is a small place.    Verdict:  Glad I went and had a great time!  Will I be back?  Nope.  Once was enough"}
{"text":"After having lunch at 4pm and being super hungry after leaving a concert, the Welcome Diner was just what I needed at 11pm.  I asked for the sunrise biscuit but subbed Brussels sprouts for the biscuit.  Chorizo, fried egg, aioli deliciousness.  They also had a yellow watermelon ginger beer that was phenomenal.  Open late, eclectic, unique, and scrumptious.  What a treat, Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Simple review. I will definitely be back... Tomorrow! Just look at the pictures. Phenomenal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the unique, quirky, off the beaten path side of Phoenix, come to the Welcome Diner.  With 9 stools around a bar near a hot kitchen, it is a small place with a lot to see.  The cooks are very friendly and talkative, and will give you their opinion on their dishes if prompted.  Try the classic cheeseburger, fries, and soda - it's definitely a favorite.  The Welcome Diner is definitely small, but worth the wait (if there even is one.)  It is truly a treasure to the historic Garfield district."}
{"text":"Great little place... Let me start by saying, they make their own tonic water for their gin (or vodka) & tonic. They have a small menu of really exceptional dishes, beverages and a couple deserts.  Great atmosphere, and friendly staff.  Definitely try the beignets, with either traditional powdered sugar, honey or \"dirty\" with peanut butter and their own preserves."}
{"text":"Maaaan, this place is tiny. Once you get past the fact that there's nine seats, and the griddle takes up about 30% of the building, you realize that this is one of those special little haunts that makes cities cool. It's totally off the beaten path, but just three blocks from First Friday mayhem. You could drive right by and never even notice it (I had about 15 times).   Inside it's surprisingly sparce, considering it's about 75 square feet. There's no AC, just a few well-placed fans on full blast. I went in the middle of the afternoon in July and felt pretty comfortable, especially considering the kitchen IS the place.   And the food... you want greasy, delicious, messy, rich, heavenly sinful pig-out fare? What's that? You want it at dirt cheap prices and with friendly service? It's perfect. The cheeseburger is oozing cheddar, the fries are sliced about four seconds before they go into the fryer and they have french toast in a cup. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The BEST after bar food! I never knew how much I needed biscuits and gravely in my life until we were told (yes, told) we needed to go here. Now my husband and I ride our bikes here often for dinner.  Can't wait to see what they do with their new location!"}
{"text":"Wow my friend found them on yelp what amazing food had welcome burger excellent.   Also had the corn dog appetizers wow the ladies I was with said it's the best hurricane they have ever had.  Great job guys a definite go to location for everyone. .."}
{"text":"What I love most about Welcome Diner is that when you are there, it doesn't feel as though you are in Phoenix.  The menu is good ol' Southern comfort food with a twist; they have Deep Eddy alcohol's and they make amazing homemade lemonade...well it's a little page right out of the South (Austin, TX to be exact).  We need more places like this.    They have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).  Any time I find a staff educated about ingredients, it's a win.  And anytime I have gone with my non-veg friends they rave about the menu as well, so I think it is safe to say that it is all yummy.  All in all, this place is simply adorable, quaint, fun and delicious.  It is small inside so if you can get in there, I highly recommend it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes for an even better dinning experience.  There are also plenty of seats outside and a to-go window which makes it even easier.  Great place to hang out, meet new people and eat good food!"}
{"text":"Dirty.  So dirty.  Hair in the french fries dirty.  Cook sitting on the counter dirty.    Undercoooked hamburger meat, and the server's fingers in my food dirty.  Flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty.  Somehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination.  As if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food.    I've been there before, and have tried to look past all these things, when eating such delicious food, but really, it's not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Yum! Ordered the welcome burger and fries both were delicious. Seating is outside which was fine. The mixed drinks were really good. Also ordered the beignets & we loved those as well. Service was prompt, & very friendly. Would recommend going now while the weather is nice since seating is outdoors the Summer months may be uncomfortable outside."}
{"text":"So good. Get anything here that comes with/on a biscuit, and you won't be disappointed. The cocktails are great too!"}
{"text":"I may have to come back a few more times to see why everyone is going bananas for the place. Our food was awesome but the service was reallllly slow. The young lady taking the orders was extremely polite and friendly but it felt like it took forever to first get up to the window and then to receive our food. I ordered the Big Jim which was a biscuit sandwich that was huge with a friend chicken inside covered in gravy, cheese and bacon. I threw on some Louisiana hot sauce and went at it. I had to eat it with a fork and nice because it was such a good hot mess I couldn't pick it up without ruining the layers. My girl ordered the Little Birdy which was a fried chicken piece topped with cheese and sandwiched in between a biscuit, both came with a couple pieces of watermelon and both were satisfying.  The fact that they close pretty late is awesome and its probably one of the main reasons why I would come back here."}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a cab driver. It was late, and the place I wanted to go to was closed. I had pulled pork mac and cheese, and it was sooo good. I was gonna try the beignets, but I was in the middle of asking the guy behind the counter about them, and he kind of drifted off and forgot to answer me. The inside is very small with about 8 seats and a small air conditioner that won't reach you if you sit by the door. If I ate here again, I'd order to go. 5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood near downtown Phoenix. We happened to be driving through on the I10 and I am so glad that we stopped. The service was friendly and had some awesome recommendations as it was our first time. Everyone loved their orders, their homemade biscuits were AMAZING. The fried green tomato sandwich on a biscuit, out of this world. It was a quick detour for some of the most memorable flavors on our trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, cozy and sweet, I was visiting Phoenix and this place and food is stunning. I loved the food."}
{"text":"Great cozy intimate spot. Outdoor setting, feels like your out front your relatives home having brunch.. staff very outgoing and sincere"}
{"text":"I loved this spot! I was in town from the midwest and crave Welcome Diner! We indulged in their vegan options. They are def slam packed non stop which is great for them but obviously causes a wait for us. Obviously we ALL wait for this amazing food with no complaints. The staff is friendly, hip and WANTS TO BE THERE! Very chill environment. Huge fan."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! This place is beyond incredible!!  I cannot say enough about the food! The Chipotle Alison donut is my favorite of all time. The chicken is ALWAYS amazing. And the ramen, nothing short of amazing! The staff is super friendly. This place is a true gem."}
{"text":"Love the bumblebee chicken sandwich and the welcome burger was one of the juiciest I have ever tasted. Quick, friendly service. 4 stars because I couldn't find napkins"}
{"text":"My husband and I live a couple of blocks away from this charming piece of history. The menu is very limited (hamburgers and hot dogs) but everything that can be gotten from a local grower or manufacturer is. They have a great variety of Southwestern toppings that they will chop and grill freshly for every burger and dog. The fries are freshly cut and delicious. The guys that run the diner are friendly and the prices are reasonable. The hours are from 11 am to 3 pm Monday through Saturday and it is a cash only operation (my only complaints!). The counter inside is tiny and seats less than 10. There are some tables outside, and a take-out window. When we were there, Matt, the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, was also getting lunch, and it was great to hear how a number of the owners of the downtown small restaurants and shops are long time friends and all support each other. Quaint places with young, hip owners, offering high quality food and goods make us feel positively about living in an often maligned part of town. We'll be back often to support the Welcome Diner."}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere with outdoor seating next to patio heaters. They sell alcohol and poutine. I got the mac and cheese with jalapeno relish for $10 and some change. I don't think I liked the jalapeno relish much since it had a burnt taste and more of a lemon taste instead of a jalapeno taste. I feel like I was lied to by the lady at the window when I was ordering when it came to what was in the jalapeno relish. The mac and cheese seemed to be missing one of it's key ingredients, cheese. It had some type of cheese sauce instead of actual cheese melted into it. I did not like it at all. It wasn't even heated up, it was straight up cold. I felt like I wasted my money here. Don't think I'll be coming back unless it's to drink some alcohol. I'll give it 2 stars for the outdoor seating and heaters but the food deserves zero stars. My girl wanted to try the poutine but wasn't able to cause they only make gravy with saugage in it and she doesn't eat pork. We both had the mac and cheese and let's just say her review would have been harsher than mine. Go somewhere else if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Welcome Diner is a good place to go when the weather is nice and you've got lots of time on your hands. It's in kind of a strange neighborhood (you may see stray dogs running around) but the outside dining area is welcoming and cute. I don't like coming in here any kind of inclement weather because pretty much all of the seating is outside, which is a bummer at night or during the summer. Also, because the kitchen is so small and Welcome Diner is so popular, you may end up waiting 40 minutes for your food.  But....what saves Welcome Diner for me is the food. I love the fried chicken and the sausage biscuits and gravy. The sandwiches are also excellent! The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and refreshing, but the lemonade is on the bitter side and leaves something to be desired. I'd recommend the food at Welcome Diner to anyone, but the atmosphere isn't always a crowd-pleaser. I would love to see them in a brick and mortar, full-service restaurant! Maybe someday."}
{"text":"Super cute place, mostly outdoor seating, really quality, tasty food - awesome mac-n-chz especially. Also had Pulled pork biscuit sandwich and we had the whitefish po'boy.  All delish and look foward to trying the burgers and fries....  Just wished it was a teeny bit less expensive on certain things. Otherwise yummy and would definately recommend"}
{"text":"Loved. Super duper friendly service. The bumble bee was delicious and filling. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. They made me a margarita even though not on the menu. The boyfriend was very pleased they played the pixies. Casual, neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"Best spot for late night grub, cool ambiance, and damn good food. Highly recommend when in downtown Phx!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place I check out most First Fridays. I like that it's open late, so after walking around and working up an appetite, it's great to find a place with great food. Seating is outdoors. The food itself is awesome. I usually get a chicken biscuit. The biscuit is great and so was the chicken. They have gravy fries (putain), but I would get those only if you have someone to split them with."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this restaurant this evening. The looks of the place was quaint and nothing like we had expected. It was better! It's the smallest diner I have ever been to,yet pleasant and clean. Even the outside tables and chairs were very clean. The young man who waited on us was friendly and helpful, and very cute, looks a bit like John Mayer. Anyway...the food is outstanding! I had a burger with mushrooms, cooked to my order. Came with the right amount of fries. The burger was delicious and plenty. My husband had the chicken sandwich, never had one so good. And for you single gals out there, the cook was as hot as the grill!  The cole slaw was different but very good. My husband ordered coffee and apple pie,the coffee was made fresh. The pie was a huge slice and worth trying..... YUMMO! The staff there was friendly,service was great. Welcome Diner is a must try."}
{"text":"Went here for first time Feb 2016 and had the grilled cheese, green tomato sammie, and fries. All were delicious! The sourdough bread was exceptional. Looking forward to trying more dishes. We will definitely be back. Charming neighborhood eatery with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have no idea how such a tiny place is able to churn out such an enormous amount of quality food.  The patio is large and eclectic with an array of mismatching tables, chairs, and lights. It's hard not to immediately feel at home here. Food has been exceptional on every visit, my favorite item being the fried green tomato sandwich. Cocktails have also been superb. It's a good bet that whatever you decide on will be both surprising and just what you were hoping for.  My husband and I had our wedding dinner at Welcome Diner and it was absolutely perfect. Before friends arrived I warned the staff that there was a sizable group coming by and if we were in the way or too loud to please let me know and I'd deal with it. The staff's response was, \"That's just the vibe here. You're fine.\" They handled the crowd that night so well, and with such great and friendly energy."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying the food was good. The drinks and the rest of the experience with the staff and the manager was enough for me to got to jail if I didn't have enough control not to hit them.  The old fashion was one of the worst I've ever had. I took the drink back to the bar, the bartender ask me what was wrong? I told him a old fashion shouldn't be red, to much bitters and to many mashed up cherries. He I formed me that's how he makes them. Ok great but it tased awful, he did pour me a straight bourbon, that wasn't to hard to make. At this point I was annoyed. Then the waiter told us our outside drinks could be inside the white fence area, because it was a health code violation I was Irritating due to the limited selection of coke, products.  Was going to leave at this point asked for boxes to take food home at this point. Decided to Take the drinks to the car. Ten minutes later a cat jumps on to the table. I told the waiter that it happened his smart ass remark was he didn't see it. This was the point I lost it, went in ask for the manager. The manager was standing right there, but walked outside as I demanded to see him another employee went and got him. I met him outside and the waiter. At this point I was really pissed off and lost my temper. They told me that can't control the yard, but I have to remove my drink that's controlling the yard but the cat that jumps on to my dinner table isn't their problem. I'm a little confused about that. If it was a rat or a mouse or other bugs it be their problem to control.   I will be calling the health department on Monday and hopefully the owner or real manger of this restaurant will respond so we can talk about how unprofessional their staff was. I admit I lost my temper, but the waiter reply to the cat being on the table after talking to me about health code violation pissed me off.    Real irritating after sending $72.00 on a decent meal to have a bad experience with the staff."}
{"text":"Legit burger! I had paradise valley burger earlier in the day and the burger here was better in my opinion. I had the peanut butter burger with bacon and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better value compared to PVB. I also had a biscuit with honey and it was delicious also. Great place, really enjoyed the overall experience. Wish they were open for lunch too."}
{"text":"This is one if my new favorite places. Great little patio/outdoor area. Small menu of great dinner food done well. Cool cocktails. Near neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food so good!  Staff so good!  Neat little old trailer and patio so GOOD!!"}
{"text":"fun place--l wish they served lunch when the weather is cool--great fries"}
{"text":"Fun local place to hang out and grab a bite when it's a reasonable temperature outside. My bumblebee was excellent. They definitely have the fried chicken and biscuits down.  My friends' three burgers were all overcooked to well-done without the any hint of pink. They're not burger snobs like I am and had no complaints but i probably would have. I also felt the drinks were weak or watered down for $10 a pop. I'll probably be back to try some other food, but it wasn't a home-run as I had hoped."}
{"text":"This review is for a visit back in August, we stopped in for dinner before a D'backs game.  I had the fish po'boy which was so good and eclipsed only by the roasted brussels sprouts.  My dad really enjoyed the Welcome Burger with fries and a PBR.  A cold gin and tonic and an outside seat for people watching under the misters.  Don't miss this great little find in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! A favorite neighborhood go to with a good happy hour! Their biscuits are made in house and the chicken is always fried perfectly! We got the little birdy (chicken, cheese, biscuit) simple and delicious! They use country gravy on their poutine which is different but still tasty. We also got the champion burger. The meat was cooked perfect and bacon jam is one of the toppings. Where has this been all my life?! On happy hour whiskey sours are only 4$ and its one of the best around.  They are also open late and have happy hour all day on Tuesdays. It's a hidden gem that everyone should know about!"}
{"text":"Wow .... wow... We moved to the Garfield Neighborhood about a month ago and have been putting off going here, first because I was never sure when it was open and next because it looked incredibly small and over crowded every time I drove by. Turns out they're open fairly normal hours and the patio is pretty big..... my fault.   My wife and I both ordered burgers I just got the normal welcome burger (I think that's the name) and my wife got a peanut butter topped burger. The food got to us fast and my burger was the best I'm had in months! my only real complaint is that I didn't order the same burger as my wife because her burger was way better than mine! oh and also if you get fries you get about 10 ... A really tasty 10 but not enough or maybe it was an illusion and they just need smaller plates.   I'll be going back soon for burgers and probably to try a few other menu items as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place. What a neat little local gem in the Garfield Historic District.  The food is delicious and the drinks are made with love and real juices. This is my favorite brunch spot downtown, and any day this is the best place to eat latenight. They'll give you the best comfort food you could possibly need, and serve your friend the best lovingly-created vegan food simultaneously.  The staff is amazing and their product is flawless, quality , and local. Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"When my wife suggested going to a diner for dinner, my mind immediately went to comfort food. You know, those culinary staples that we all need in good times and bad. Needless to say, I was looking forward to it.  When we arrived at Welcome Diner, my first observation was the location. A somewhat rundown neighborhood undergoing changes of gentrification. The diner itself sits on the corner directly across from what looked like an old market that had been turned into a cafe/bar. Overall, a very intriguing location within a very positive and vibrant community.   You don't order your food at Welcome Diner like you would at your normal greasy spoon. There isn't the smell of fried potatoes and stale coffee or a waitress with big Texas hair brining you biscuits and gravy. You actually order your food from a small window in front of the diner. Once you order, you can sit inside if there is room or sit outside. The weather last night was really nice. Not hell hot, so we sat outside. FYI, finding seating outside can be a little hairy. There are several tables and some counter type seating, but all of the outside seating is first come, first serve.  The menu is simple, but take comfort food to a whole new level. To give you an example, when I think about a diner, I think about meatloaf. So I ordered Welcome's version. A Chorizo Meatloaf covered in a Chipotle and white wine cream sauce, picked vegetables, and Brahbant potatoes. Very innovative in my book. When you cut into the meatloaf you get an incredible burst of flavor with the sauce and pickled veg. The potatoes added the salty flavor to the sweetness of the pickled veg. My wife ordered the Koko, which was a sandwich consisting of a pieces fried chicken, covered in Chipotle ranch dressing topped with tomato and arugula. Then all of the aforementioned is stuff between a sliced biscuit. I only sampled the chicken, but it was full of flavor an tender. My daughter ordered the bacon Mac N' Cheese. She at a little more than half of it, which told me it was off the charts. I tried it and loved it. The bacon in the Mac N' Cheese wasn't just your average, tiny bacon bits. It was actual small pieces of bacon. As a side, we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts. they weren't roasted as much as I do them at home, but they were still good. I also ordered a Manhattan off of their cocktail menu.  No complaints on the service or wait staff. Everyone we interacted with was very friendly. Especially the gentleman who took our order at the window. He wasn't rushing people and chatting with them a bit. Basically, making you feel.....Welcome. Parking was easy for us to find. In fact, we got a spot right in front of the diner itself. I noticed a lot of people were Ubering to the diner as well.  If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again, I'm definitely going back to the Welcome Diner."}
{"text":"I think this place is a must for those who love the phx food scene. They have a small indoor seating which is within a small trailer so preferably sit outside. The popular menu item here is called the big Jim and it's definitely worth it. A fried chicken breast sandwiches between two big biscuits with bacon and cheese. Then it's smothered with gravy that's oh so good. I also recommend getting some French fries, Mac and cheese and maybe even a drink. Great thing also about this place is that it opens late! So for those to come out of LUXX and want to turn down, this place is a less than a mile away."}
{"text":"This late night diner has all the perfect comfort food that you can dream of.  From biscuits and gravy to jambalaya, the food is fantastic, and I always get a few laughs from the staff. Definitely a classic and local favorite of downtown. The chicken is on point as-well."}
{"text":"What a great little find. A little oasis in the middle of a foreboding neighborhood. Have been a few times (once twice in the same day) and not yet disappointed. Except, once when i came on a monday and they were closed."}
{"text":"I told my hubby we absolutely had to stop by welcome diner during our trek to Phoenix.   From downtown we took a short lightrail ride (because he doesn't like to walk recreationally) then ironically still had to walk for what appeared to be forever through the sketchy part of town -- no we didn't take the art district route.  The diner literally is a mobile kitchen. Bigger than a food truck, I mean enough to situate a counter, a line of barstools and the cooking area. The guys on board are super friendly, accommodating and truly love the contribution they've made to the community.  Yes this little kitchen serves cocktails and beer.  We ordered the acclaimed big Jim, two of them, hash browns and beignets.   Our big Jims were delicious. Extremely hearty with extra gravy. Unfortunately, however, without the gravy, the biscuit would be just thirst inducingly dry.  I suppose that would be one way to get you to drink more!    Again loved the gravy. They even gave me a ramikin of their mushroom gravy cause they felt I had to try it..also quite delicious.   The hash browns and beignets were alright but didn't contribute to this diner's stars.  We were impressed with our main entrees and by the guys who run this little miracle on wheels."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and you literally get to eat outside at a picnic table.  I came here due to extrinsic circumstances, and would not have ordinarily tried it based on it's location/outward appearance; but, after eating here, I realize I would have been a fool to avoid it.  This is a must eat restaurant!"}
{"text":"Cool diner in the middle of my changing neighborhood. Lots of wild conversations , no space inside and the kitchen is Right in ur face! My friend Olivia was drinkin something sweet lol, and I'm not sure what it was called but good mix! Enjoyed the bumble bee chicken sandwich , dijon mustard and honey on top of the bread was bomb!  I didn't sit outside but it looked nice , but I did dig the inside and enjoyed myself. This place is hipsterific and I'm fine with that, come here for a different taste of Phx...  4 STARS"}
{"text":"Lots of vegan and vegetarian options. The fried green tomato sandwich was tasty but very messy, and made the bread quite soggy. The chess pie was delicious. The outdoor space was fun to hang out in after hours. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Welcome Diner has made me rethink fries with toppings. Someone (chef) tell me the secret of layering your already tasty fries with savory pork and somehow keeping the fries crispy underneath?! It's one of life's greatest mysteries but I am okay with it. Can't wait to return for a homemade whiskey sour- the mix is tangy and tart and just plain yummy."}
{"text":"I wish I could pack this place up and take it back to Lawrence with me!! Love it. -Maisie. Cousin of Joe from Jayhawk Country."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Perfect hang out spot with friends they close at 2am! Even cute for a first date! Not many vegetarian/vegan options though. I loved the feeling of being at home, the customer service was excellent they even gave us a little down town history! Will deff go back! Thank you welcome dinner!"}
{"text":"Well this was a nice surprise. Great food, awesome service, area slightly sketchy, and I definitely wish there was more good seating.   You walk up to order at the little window,  sit down,  and they'll bring your meal out. Takes a good 15+ minutes to make your food , so a nice wait.   The poutine uses cream gravy instead of brown.  Different,  but still good.  The pork bbq fries were great. The pulled pork was heated up on the griddle which gave it a nice crisp. Tasty too!  The beignets were the star of the night. Wow! Outstanding taste and quality.  Make sure to get those.  Good place, try it out!!"}
{"text":"The Welcome Diner is a welcome experience. Modern meets the past in this old school diner setting with an infusion of handcrafted mixed drinks using unusual ingredients (Creosote, anyone?) and delicious food. My friend and I grabbed two appetizers, including pulled pork french fries (they had a Jackfruit fries option!) and Octopus Masa Balls. Wow! They were kind of like hush puppies, and we giggled a lot about the name. I forget the name of my drink but it was like a ice smoothie with absinthe in it and was so yummy. I had a Big Jim burger on a biscuit smothered in gravy with cheese for $11. Huge! And different, and tasty! I'd love to come back and see how they progress and if the menu changes over time, which the waitress said it probably would."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to be in, especially when it's late and you're wanting to eat a nice meal! I always get the macaroni with bacon and its so delicious?  :) Wonderful people here!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to have chicken and biscuits. Very small with a larger outdoor area. If you have a hankering for fried chicken this is the place.   The biscuits were amazing. Light with substance. A joy to eat. I wanted more  The fried chicken was not greasy and super moist."}
{"text":"So I was downtown today doing some charity work with friends. One of them mentioned that we had to try out \"Welcome Diner\". So we did. OMG!!! Found my new favorite Burger spot. Everything was amazing. Literally the BEST fries I've ever had. Plus they have a full bar and ice cold beer. I highly recommend it and will be back soon. Manager Zach is really nice too!"}
{"text":"Great little funky place.  Unique food done very well.  Inexpensive place to chill out open late."}
{"text":"I just love everything about this place. The location, the outside seating, the vibe, the food ... everything.  The kitchen is very small. This vintage diner car was meant for one cook. So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork.   The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car.   This would be a great date place ... if that's something you're looking for. This is also a good place for a group of around 6 friends to take over a picnic table."}
{"text":"I will say I was a little surprised to drive up to this place and see it is in a neighborhood on the corner as if it was previously someone's house (pretty sure it may have been). As for seating there are two options either outside on their \"patio\" (felt like someones front yard with chairs) or inside which gave you more of an old school dining car feel. I ordered there PB + B burger and my husband had their shrimp Po'boy special. I had heard eating Peanut butter on your burger was good so of course I had to give it a try. I must say it was a bit odd but very good, the burger was very juicy and flavorful, the bacon and cheese gave it that salty taste that went great along side the crunchy peanut butter. I would say it probably isn't for everyone and fair warning it is very heavy on the stomach... about half way through it just hits you and realize just how full you are lol. My husband's Shrimp Po'Boy was very good, the bread was super fresh and the tomato base spread gave it amazing flavor, I would say it was more of a \"Prawn\" Po'boy because the shrimp were so big. Overall the food was very good, I am a bit skeptical about the outdoor seating it was just a little too weird for me, I would definitely go back but would prefer to sit inside if there is room. I hope they continue to do well and maybe they'll be able to expand."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Phoenix, Welcome Diner offers a modern twist on comfort foods like chicken and biscuits, fries, etc.  Their servings were very generous and our food came out pretty quickly -especially considering we visited on a Friday night during prime dinner hours.   I particularly love that they offer veggie-friendly options.. their bbq jackfruit burgers and fries are amazing!! It can be hard to find restaurants that accommodate vegetarians, which makes this place even more special.  Just a heads up tho, the majority of seating here is outdoors. Aka. be prepared during the winter months for the cold/ during the summer months for the heat.. I think there are like 5 seats inside near the kitchen, but otherwise everything else is picnic benches or tables :) I'll definitely be back here once it's a little warmer again outside!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after reading the review here. My Wife and I are glad we did.   This place was sooo good. A true diamond in the rough.   The food was perfect. My Wife had the welcome burger and fries. It came out cook exactly the way she asked. I tried the big jim and the cannibal fries. I was only able to eat mine with a fork and knife. It hit the spot. The fires we excellent!!.   We each had a drink with our meal, they did not disappoint either.   I would eat here all the time if I lived closer, so maybe that is a good thing. I would weight about 500lbs.   If you are even remotely close, check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Delish, but overpriced for a burger joint."}
{"text":"What a great local spot! Off the beaten path amongst single family homes you would most likely not find if you didn't search it out. It's a mostly outdoor venue so in the Arizona summers, beware. There is a small seating area inside, about 7 seats.  My favorite food option is the bumblebee!! Fried chicken with honey smack dab in the middle of two yummy biscuits. Yum!!  I haven't tried a drink here yet but hear they are delicious! That's next on the list."}
{"text":"Delicious grub. Highly recommended. The Big Jim lives up to the hype. And they sell beer too. Just a half mile away. Good for Cardinal's game day."}
{"text":"I'm TORN. Between writing this review for the staff an owners of welcome and the potential influx of customers. This diner has been an very meaningful and influential part of my Arizona life. From meeting some of my best friends to my roommate that allowed me to move just two blocks away from this amazing place. To late night burger runs to a disappointed Monday bike ride, I've loved it all. If I had my Monday back for every welcome burger I've had I might actually be able to afford a car but I regret nothing. I feel for the staff that deals with the question of alterations on their already perfect menu. (Written while listening to the dumbest of request)   I may move onto other states of employment and residency but I hope to forever return to a place that has meant so much to me."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place and was super excited to check it out. I ordered the Bumblebee (fried chicken, biscuit, honey, mustard) and my husband ordered the  PB&B burger (burger with peanut butter and bacon).  My dish came with a few pieces of sweet watermelon and his came with a side of slaw. We first experienced a peanut butter burger at rehab where they also add grape jelly and sriracha and my husband has been on a PB burger roll ever since. He thought his burger was very tasty and ate his whole plate. I liked my biscuit dish but I think I was expecting something a little more....substantial? The chicken was really great and moist but it felt like there was something missing. I think I was expecting it to be slathered in honey/sauces but it was certainly worth the price ($8.50). I'd definitely come again but I think I'll try another dish next time."}
{"text":"Great dive in the middle of downtown. Great food and drinks are strong. One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had. Very good!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't love here but tonight was cold and the patio was still packed. My friend and I shared a Hot Toddy and, by recommendation from the gentleman in the window, mac n cheese with chorizo. I would've gone with fried chicken but he said chorizo was his preference. It was delicious. The Toddy and macaroni was perfect comfort food on a cold night. This is only one experience. I've brought everyone from friends, dates, and clients to my mom, brother and sisters all separately. Let's just say I love this place and I love introducing new people to it. Most people go for the Big Jim fried chicken sandwich and I won't wrong them for it but you have to try their Po Boy, poutines, burgers and jackfruit dishes. You get lucky if you can find room at the counter but the patio is very comfortable and the service outside is exceptional and with a smile. Tell your friends!"}
{"text":"The 'No way Jose' burger was one of the best burgers I have had. I would say in the list of top 5 burgers in my life. When I ordered medium rare they explained \"our medium rare is warm to the touch in the middle, mostly red on the inside and a little bloody\". That's exactly how it came out and it tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Welcome Diner. Solid food and solid service make this a favorite. Just had the PB&B burger with real deal THICK cut bacon, bread and butter pickles and my favorite chunky peanut butter. Cooked to perfection and delivered promptly, it went down quick with an ice cold PBR. Before dinner I had their version of Sazerac, made with a rye whiskey in lieu of cognac. Delish. Probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink! Also to die for is the bumblebee, imagine an amazing chicken sandwich on a top notch biscuit drizzled with honey. Yum! I'm full as I write this waiting on beignets that were comped because our side of fries didn't make it out, but I could eat a bumblebee because it's that good. So great food, great drinks and a great al fresco dining experience make Welcome Diner one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. If you come at night sit at the big round table on the 10th street side for great views of downtown."}
{"text":"I love the Welcome Diner. It's my favorite spot for late night eats in Phoenix (opens till 2am). It's such a cool concept and they serve up some pretty good-sized portions of food. Welcome Diner operates out of a Valentine Diner (a mobile pop-up restaurant from the 40's) and is located in the historic Garfield neighborhood (they have a second location in Tucson). They have both outdoor and limited indoor seating and serve up Southern-inspired American dishes made from scratch. You'll find huge buttermilk biscuit sandwiches, burgers, po' boy sandwiches, fried chicken and jambalaya on their menu along with a variety of delicious cocktails to choose from. In fact, Connor Mansager of the Welcome Diner was recently declared the 2017 Arizona Star Bartender at the Devour Phoenix Bartending Competition a couple weeks ago. I pulled a late nighter here with some buddies and we tore up a Big Jim (fried chicken, gravy, bacon and an egg on a biscuit), No Way Jose (a burger with jalapeno relish, smoked Gouda and chipotle ranch) and the Carol (braised pork and BBQ sauce on a biscuit). Another favorite of mine is the Peanut Butter burger. Our food definitely hit the spot after a fun night of boozing. Btw... share a side of fries with someone as they are pretty generous with their portions. I love the throwback ambiance of this place to old school diners of the past. My only knock is we had some smokers next to us as we ate our food on the patio. But overall a great experience as always and the staff is usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"After a big night during First Friday, tired and slightly hungover, I needed some comfort food.  Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.  The diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.  We got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.  We so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.  Whatever you do, find a way somehow to include a biscuit in your meal here."}
{"text":"Food was on point. Only a half dozen seats inside,  but plenty of seating outside! The food is creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Went after seeing Taruk at the Talking Stick Resort Arena (America West/US Airways Arena).  Finally in the area while they're open!  Woohoo!  Got there and checked out the menu - interesting assortment of foods.  Everybody's happy!  Got our order in and sat back down...the rain started to move from a drizzle to steady...no cover outside (just shade cloth) and all 9 of the inside seats were taken.  Switched our order to takeout and sent everyone to the car.  Got the order and headed home.  Almost none of the fries survived the drive (we were hungry, and they were really tasty!)  I ordered the Bumblebee - that's a southern fried chicken breast (boneless) biscuit sandwich.  It had dijon mustard, pickles, and honey...not really my flavor profile - not sure if it was the mustard or the pickles, but just missed by a bit for my taste (biscuit was great, chicken was very good).  Everybody enjoyed their orders, and we finished up with beignets - great way to finish off!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. I would def recommend this spot for comfort food. The fried chicken sandwich is not to be missed & the fries are amazing! Just ask for extra crispy. Can't wait to go back & try a burger they looked amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Right in downtown phoenix, a semi small Diner turned outside patio dining southern foodie haven.. Did someone say biscuits and gravy with fried chicken? How about you add some bacon too and then top it off with some beignets? Legit fried chicken and the biscuits are yummy. Great friendly service behind the small counter where you can see the cooking and the bartending happening. Or walk up outside and order and find your own table. Gotta try the Big Jim or the Bumblebee. Definitely will be back to try the Po'Boys and the poutine fries. Love that they are right down the road from us and I can go satisfy my southern cravings.   Beignets are 3 to an order and not Cafe DuMonde but the honey drizzle s fantastic! They have a liquor license and the drinks were pouring...street parking or across the street, there is a lot."}
{"text":"I adore Welcome Diner. There's so much to love about this restaurant. I absolutely adore the outdoor seating, especially during the cooler months in Arizona, with the gorgeous overhead lights. The service is always excellent; everyone that works here genuinely looks like they enjoy their job. Brace yourselves for long lines, and a long wait for your food. Don't worry, the food is worth the wait!   My favorite items on the menu are Bumblebee and Koko. I love the taste of salty and sweet together; if you are the same way then you would certainly enjoy Bumblebee. The delicious crispy chicken pairs well with the honey. I am not usually a fan of biscuits but they do it so well at Welcome Diner. Koko is also my favorite. This is what I order when I prefer something less tasty but equally as good as Bumblebee. I always pair my sandwiches with their delicious french fries, paired with their (garlic?) sauce. My boyfriend always get their burger (No Way Jose) and he loves it. Welcome Diner is not just perfect for brunch or dinner. It is the perfect place to just hang out and have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Food was great. Nice chill location, unpretentious with food and alcohol, I'm there! It was around midnight that we decided to go and plus we've always wanted to try this place. I heard it gets really busy on the weekends so thurs was the perfect time to try it out. It's strange how the diner sits in the middle of a quiet neighborhood but whatever, I'm here for the food. We got the poutine fries, fried chicken biscuit sandwich, a side salad, and beignets to top it off. Everything was so delicious even down to the salad.  I would definitely come here again. The beignets are a little more dense than the ones in New Orleans and I've never had it with honey before but nonetheless it was still pretty yummy."}
{"text":"First time at Welcome Diner. Really good looking menu but the execution really failed.   I arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night with my daughter and her husband. We were 15th in line yet didn't get a table for an hour. With one window taking all of the orders, it was painfully slow.   Our food didn't arrive for another 40 minutes. Yes, an hour and forty total. Brutal. I ordered a burger with poutine fries as a side, along with water. My daughter got the fried green tomato sandwich and water while her husband got the jambalaya and a coke.  After ordering you have to 'fight' for a table, which are few. We sat with two other couples at the family style seating.   My burger was good but the fries were awful. I'd never had poutine before but it was cold. I grabbed my first fry and got a mass of 15 fries welded together. Poorly done. The fried green tomato sandwich was another fail, as the toast was thick, hard and cold. She ended up eating it open faced. The jambalaya was okay.   Service was non-existent so we were ignored.   I may try Welcome Diner again, based on the clever menu but I am hesitant."}
{"text":"I got a burger here and it was absolutely amazing. So good that I just had to return a week later to try the other burger on the menu. I also got a few bites of the fried chicken biscuit, the mac and cheese, and the gumbo. All very good (but the burger totally wins)."}
{"text":"WOW!!   What an amazing location and staff! We came here on a Tuesday night for our first time and couldn't believe how rad and friendly the staff were.   There food was delicious and super affordable! We got the Big Jim with the chipotle ranch and it was to die for.   This place deserves more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This quaint diner is set in downtown Phoenix in a residential area. They do not have much for children, thus may not be the best place for family with toddlers. Because it's outside seating, it's best to go in the evening when weather is cooler. I had the no way Jose burger  which was very tasty, and my 11 yr old had the Mac&cheese; she loves it! They cool to order so you may have to wait awhile before your food is served. We waited about 25mins. I will definitely go back again and try some of their biscuits and gravy dishes."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for just over 3 years now and the jackfruit poboy was the best \"meat substitute\" meal I've ever had. I appreciated all the options I had too. They are willing to sub jackfruit for any of the non-vegetarian dishes. On top of that, the service was great even with it being full for happy hour. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was right, coming back more has made this place grow on me. The hurricanes are so much better than they were before and the food is amazing. The staff is all great and I've become friends with several of them.   Try the jackfruit fries, O.M.G."}
{"text":"This place is great. Get the Big Jim, it is outstanding. The staff are so laid back and nice."}
{"text":"Update:   After reading the talk thread on yelp about the welcome diner I am so happy that they are not closing!  Turns out they decided not to and now are going to open a second one in the not too distant future.  I am so sad that I came here on the last day that this little diner will be open.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine who is a regular patron.  It was a nice Saturday afternoon so we ate outside and I think the little diner (with 8 seats) was full.  I had a single patty cheeseburger and the favorite and a coke.  The favorite is fresh cut fries with peppers, onions and a few other things that made this a delicious side dish.  It was all soooo good... I am glad I had the opportunity to try it."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.  I had the fish and it was so good.  Spicy!   The drinks are really good too.  Check out the Ginger beer.   Come for happy hour and enjoy"}
{"text":"Welcome Diner has become one of my Phoenix favorites.   It's hard to tell which stands out the most, their amazing food preparations or their welcoming staff.   1st patronage: we were able to sit inside the tiny trailer and the guys who were working that day were awesome. Great customer service, made us feel known and welcomed! That day I enjoyed the Welcome Burger with no regrets! Husband got the Big Jim & was very satisfied!   2nd patronage: I popped by for an iced coffee (they serve Lux brew) , and the gal working (can't remember her name now, but she's got blue hair ;) was super friendly! She even hooked me up with a refill for the price of free, I was like wow, these folks are nice :)  3rd patronage: we weren't feeling meat, so we tried the Vegan Po' Boy...was surprised at what a delicious sandwich it was, nothing poor about it!   Their fries are the best around. Their coleslaw is distinct. Their service is appreciated. I'm looking forward to enjoying more meals here.   I'm busy and really don't have time to write reviews, but I'll type one up for a local business I want to support! They also use all local AZ grown ingredients folks.   Don't be intimidated by the humble surroundings from the outdoor seating area. It's comfortable and unpretentious, a sweet little spot to enjoy some real good food."}
{"text":"Good service and yummy food. I had the PB&B burger and my boyfriend had the No Way Jose burger. Both were good and we both enjoyed the fries. We plan to eat there regularly now! I do recommend to get there early or prepare to stand in line and wait by the fence for an available table."}
{"text":"I love food, and this is my favorite food in the Valley.   Always fresh, with creative salad options and the BEST vegetarian options.   They make some \"Pulled Jackfruit Fries\" which are bomb. They cook the jackfruit the same way they cook their pulled pork... beer marinated and what not. It's totally divine.   The late-night hours are great and the outdoor seating lets me take advantage of one of my favorite things about living here - the cool Phoenix nights. So in to it."}
{"text":"Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).  Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.  Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)  Oh and order off the menu the \"Cannibal Fries\".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)"}
{"text":"Not too many diners get good reviews but this was a well deserved. Happy friendly staff.   Locale is not the best but the food makes up for it.   This was right of the plane and hungry place- good choice. They have a bloody merryish beer drink. Interesting!"}
{"text":"When I got the directions to this place I was certain I had been led astray because I was going into a residential part of the city. Low and behold the diner was there, random in the middle of this Phoenix neighborhood. There are a few seats inside but the real experience is to sit out front. Do not expect to sit down at a normal booth and keep to yourself. The seating is basically lawn furniture and a few picnic tables giving the whole experience a backyard barbeque feel. As far as atmosphere \"hipster\" would be the greatest understatement of the year. I could have ridden a bicycle made of mustaches wearing the first black rimmed glasses ever made and I would not have been hip enough among the patrons. The menu is small but efficient and the food we received tasted great. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich with bacon and a hurricane to drink."}
{"text":"solid solid burger and solid fries! the place is awkward but fun! the people are great and well nothing to complain about. price was good too, plenty of parking as well!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place via a Yelp email that was advertising places in my area. After checking out the reviews and the menu, my wife and I decided to grab a late dinner here on a Friday night. As soon as we arrived I noticed this place just had an awesome vibe to it. Friendly staff, laid back patio seating, and the food is beyond amazing. We had the Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Little Birdy fried chicken biscuit, Fries, and a glass bottle Coke (the kind sweetened with real sugar).   In a nutshell: Love this place. We'll be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and house made ginger ale.  Dinner came along with entertainment - police raid next door."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend just tried Welcome Diner the other night, we wanted to go to a place that both of us have never been too. It was an awesome choice! It may not look like much from the street but you definitely have to give it a try.   We both had burgers and an appetizer and all the food was great and prepared well. It is nice to go to a place that focuses on buying local food and contributing the the community.   I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and absolutely loved their food. I got the Big Jim (fried chicken on a biscuit with gravy and bacon), added an egg and split some of their pulled pork fries. It was excellent. I would highly recommend.   I've also been to their sister location, welcome chicken + donuts. I have to say I enjoy their fare here much more.   The location has odd hours, 5pm-2am and is strictly outside patio seating on a sandy yard in the arts suburbs in downtown Phoenix. It's got an incredibly hipster vibe to it which may or may not be your cup of tea. The friend I was with described it as \"A bunch of stoners setting up shop in a run down house making really good food\". His assessment may or may not reflect my own.   I wouldn't go before 9pm personally unless the temp is under 90 degrees because of the seating and how heavy the food is. But this is definitely one of the best fried chicken and biscuits I've had in Phoenix so I definitely recommend checking this place out when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I loved this place. There's qualifiers as to why we liked it so much,so hold your horses and read on.   We shared the chicken honey mustard biscuit. I thought it was good but would try something else next time. My husband ordered beignets. They were good and the closest thing to NOLA I've had outside of the real thing. I probably would've liked them more if the honey was served on the side instead of under the beignet.   Before you think I'm crazy, trust me on this-the Brussels sprouts were awesome! They're not your mamas Brussels sprouts! My husband, not a big fan typically, thought they were great too. Every meal since then when we discuss what veggie to have with our home meals I ask for Brussel sprouts. Not any but THEIRS. I could probably go vegetarian on these things. Flat out YUMMY!  5 stars for just the brussel sprouts? While they deserved it, the 5 stars comes because it's a seriously cool business. Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly.   Basically it's a bunch of really cute guys, most in bands, who not only have great personalities but they are awesome cooks. They are very aware of local (when possible), quality, natural/organic (when possible) food and are creative with their dishes. I'll be back and I'm bringing some GFs next time. ;-)"}
{"text":"First time in after eying this spit for months. Was absolutely CRAVING a burger and I have not found a decent burger in PHX in the year I've lived here. And I've tried them all...  The Champion is just that, super juicy & flavorful & cooked to perfection. This is my pick for the BEST BURGER IN PHOENIX HANDS DOWN. This is where you go when you actually appreciate a good burger, and by good burger I mean; medium rare, savory, and not overloaded with toppings like hopdoddy & zinburger... the focus is on the meat & that my friends is how a good burger turns into a great burger. Gtfo with the double well done patties & fancy toppings. Roomate even said it was better than Gordan Ramsays. Cannot wait to try the poutine & the biscuit sammys"}
{"text":"This little diner is so beautiful at night. Love the service and the food here!"}
{"text":"some of the best food in downtown phoenix hands down & fantastic customer service!! i love the consistency of this place, and i constantly crave the pulled pork fries. keep up the good work! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It totally remind me of hole in wall joint in San Diego. The vibe is great and the food is amazing. You know it's a great place to eat when the line is hitting the street."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Everything I have had which is a huge variety of things has honestly been delicious and amazing. Their jackfruit is especially good. But really all of it is good. The catfish, the chicken, anything. Super good!! Their drinks are on point too."}
{"text":"I've never had anything here that wasn't amazing. If you want a burger, there's is by far the best. You can't go wrong with any options. Vegetarians (and carnivores) will love the Jackfruit. Plus it's got a laid back atmosphere that's perfect when you want a low key dinner without compromising for low quality food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing here.  We ordered our food from the food stand area, which felt a little weird at first, but we quickly got used to that, as when the food came out it came fast and high quality.  Then we got a free piece of pie! Shit was yummy!!"}
{"text":"A true hidden gem , in the middle of a neighborhood in downtown Phoenix . My boyfriend and I have been here now let's say 7xs and I'm shame to say I'm finally writing a quick review. There food is delicious and fresh. Check out my pictures I definitely recommend this outdoor diner to everyone you won't regret it. My favorite is the koko; crispy moist fried chicken in between delicious biscuits with a spicy cream sauce and fresh tomato and arugula with a side of sweet watermelon !"}
{"text":"By time my food arrives my friends are done eating wack services . I was the first one to order too lol had get my money back"}
{"text":"Can't give this place enough stars. Granted I live two blocks away so I usually get food togo. The food is always phenomenal!"}
{"text":"If know about the Welcome Diner, chances are you've heard about it by word of mouth or just stumbled across it by chance. Regardless, this place is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Everything in the place feel like you stepped into David Lynch's mind while having happy thoughts. The place is super small (8 seats) but that just adds to the authenticity of eating in what might one day be a museum piece of 1950's culture.  The food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap. If it's the right day, be sure to see if they're making veggie burgers and ask for a float too. The staff is also really chill and make sure that you're satisfied. They offer everything: good food, good atmosphere, and a good experience.  I just wish they had later hours...."}
{"text":"Today has been a downtown hipster kind of day. This was my first time eating here.   Prepare yourself to be outside, the seats are limited so pretend like you're on a cruise. Sit with strangers and make a new friend.  I got the beignets, I'm practicing for my trip to New Orleans, which were super YUMMY. I also got the poultine fries but because of the wait, my friend waited about 30 min for the Bumblebee, the fries came slightly cold.  The people were great and I made new friends. The staff was friendly and apologetic about the wait for our food.  I probably won't come back"}
{"text":"What's better than a night of drinking than jackfruit fries and peanut butter on your burger? But for real, late night or even just a casual evening, welcome diner delivers amazing burgers and fried chicken sandwiches with a chill and cozy outdoor patio or a small diner feel inside. A favorite spot for sure"}
{"text":"You just landed at the Phoenix airport.  The desert sun is beating down your neck, you're feeling hungry, and all of a sudden, your stomach starts growling!  Well, thanks to yelp, good food isn't too far from the airport.    3.1 miles away from the airport is a piece of heaven called Welcome Diner.  So don't be confused that you are driving in the middle of a residential area, and bam, you see this red and white building and bright red umbrellas everywhere!  Next to the building is another bright red object (aka the fence), but this time it's a red painting of a little boy eating what looks like bread.  I'm a bit confused but I'm already getting a good vibe from this place!  So now unto the food.  Mini-me is a sucker for orange juice, and luckily they had freshly squeezed OJ.  This is a minor detail for some folks, but I'm a sucker for freshly squeezed OJ.  I had the holy puerco, and it was sinfully fantastic.  Imagine a layer of sliced polenta, a layer of carnitas, and then a layer of eggs over medium, and finally it's sprinkled with crunchy chicharones.  Yes, it was a stack of deliciousness!  The hubby had the burger with a bacon jam, and I think he enjoyed it since he had no crumbs left at the end of the meal.  Honestly, I was so pleased with my holy puerco that I ignored the entire family.      Phoenix peeps, check this place out.  Don't forget to check out their daily specials and drinks and desserts.  I will definitely stop by the next time I'm in PHX."}
{"text":"Super good. Took a midnight trip to flavor town. This place is always really good with a fun environment."}
{"text":"Too little food for the price. Not really worth it. I wouldn't recommend the biscuit cause it split so easily that I don't think it's good with fried chicken ( I got Bumblebee) . But it's just my opinion. PB&B was good but still a bit too pricey for the amount we got."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! I've been here for brunch and dinner and everything was amazing!! My bf says their burger is the best burger he has ever had and I have to agree. Super juicy!! The bumblebee is on point too!! I can't wait to go back and try the bacon cheddar fries :) I recommend this place to all my friends when they ask for a awesome place to eat downtown. And they are open late!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to grab a casual dinner in Phoenix.  It is usually pretty busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait a while unless you can find a spot at the 8-10 seats inside.  Unless you are a veg I expect you to try the fries smothered in pork and slaw.  Hands down the best thing I've had there to date.  The PB&B burger is great and so is the Bumble Bee biscuit.  If you live in the downtown area or you hit up RoRo often, stop into this gem of a diner.  The staff is really hip and really friendly."}
{"text":"I can't stand 50's retro but this place is the cuteness. Well...I haven't technically been inside. Now, I knew this was a hipster hangout, but I wasn't expecting the cute girl in the apron or the boy with tattoos to actually be working on the other side of that window. They didn't seem to mind that I was slightly drenched in sweat having walked there under the sun of a blazing March afternoon. They were quite nice and gave my sister and I a bowl of water for our doggies. Tattoo boy said he would even make us more fries if we wanted. The fries ($2) were not the best  and neither was my grilled cheese ($4) with tomato (yum!) and pickles (?). However, the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute. Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive. Holler.  P.S. Don't forget the Ca$hM0nayyy or to borrow from a sibling!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. I've been here multiple times and it has never failed. My favorite is still the \"Big Jim\". Biscuit, gravy, bacon and a big-o piece of chicken. Fire!!! Today I had a mixed drink too and are always on point. Old fashion, whiskey sour and the Palomas are a must try. Over all good experience and will always recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and good service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. The overall set up is slightly small but it gives it a homey feel. The cocktails were to die for. Love the homemade tonic. I enjoyed the Paloma and The Last Word. We sat at the bar top inside since it was so crowded, and it was awesome to watch the chefs and staff work. Whole team seemed extremely stoked to serve us and be at work which is always a positive. This was last Saturday btw, and there was a line out the door.   I got the Honeybee sandwich and the Brussels sprouts. I tried my friend's jackfruit Po Boy and regular Po Boy. The food was perfect. The exact right amount of home style food with a bit of a twist.   My friends and I also shared a bottle of Provisioner white. We sell it at my work for $12 and I was pleased that they sold it by the bottle for $15. Paired deliciously with the food.   I will definitely be back on Tuesday for all night happy hour. Being in the industry, it's hard to find a spot with amazing drinks and food late, but Welcome Diner pleasantly surprised me!"}
{"text":"Oh my very favorite!  Poutine! Not at all like the traditional, but oh-so-good and imo, so much better! Sandwiches served on biscuits?!? Heaven! I only wish this place was open for breakfast.  Oh yes, and service? Top notch!"}
{"text":"In every good television show, the characters have a local eatery where the ambiance is prime and the characters seem so at ease.   Well, if my life ends up being like The Truman Show, I could see Welcome Diner being that place.   The location and diner evoke an old-school sense of belonging. You feel like you're part of a real community when you sit outside (even in the 100+ degree weather) sipping on a great cocktail amongst old houses and the typical noises of a neighborhood.  The food is a perfect harmony of fresh culinary vision and traditional greasy spoon deliciousness.  So, get here soon; I am sure you'll feel welcomed too."}
{"text":"I love the vibe and location of this place!  Nestled within a neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, outside patio dining (there's never any room in the small trailer, whenever I've eaten here), and a great view of the stars are just some of the great aspects of this particular diner.  It's definitely a departure from the typical dingy diner, that has mostly artificial lighting; and is surrounded by hipster patrons.  No, wait! Hold on a sec!   Except of the latter comment; it truly is a breath of fresh air - literally!  The food isn't spectacular, but that isn't the allure of this place. It's just an awesome place to hangout, and enjoy a decent meal. This particular time, we had the Welcome Burger and Fries; as well as, Grilled Cheese and Watermelon with a side of Jackfruit fries.  Definitely a unique meal with an allure all its own. Particular notables were the juicy hamburger, crispy bacon, yummy jackfruit fries, and the sweet watermelon!  The weather outside was just perfect, and everyone working here were so friendly and chill.  The place is definitely \"on fleek!\"   There, that's my first and final homage to the urban hipsters that were seated next to us that basically used nothing but words found in the hipster vernacular dictionary.  Nonetheless, I love this place!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Welcome Diner since they stopped being a breakfast/lunch spot...so who knows how long ago that was!  I enjoyed the second generation cocktail - vodka, fresh grapefruit and lime juice, passion fruit and mint...well mixed and so tasty!  I also had a little birdy biscuit with fried chicken and cheddar and a side of roasted brussels sprouts...the serving size was so large I ended up taking half of my meal home.  Definitely get their early so you can get a seat at the counter inside...it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Went on late night and had THE MOST AMAZING BISCUIT AND CHICKEN. Do yourself a favor a visit this place.  It's super hipster and people are really nice.  That all being said,  the poutine fries were weird.  It was fries with white gravy.  Not at all what I thought I was going to be getting when ordering poutine."}
{"text":"Walk up window to order, patio tables to eat.  Service was great, the guy at the window introduced himself, welcomed us and then made some great recommendations both on and off the menu.  Food came out quickly and was delicious!  -PB&B Burger Med-rare was fantastic (tip: you can upgrade the side to poutine for $3(off menu))  -Big Jim was Very Good, gravy was great but the biscuit was a little dry. Still very good though. -Poutine was fantastic!! Hands down Fantastic!! -Mac & Cheese side was good, but I feel like it really could have been better. It was a very classic dish and didn't have the flair of the rest of their menu. -Ginger Beer is homemade and is VERY GOOD, strong, tart, good.  A few reasons for the missing star: 1 the chairs, I had to swap out a broken chair and then sat in another one that had a bent leg that almost broke before I traded it in too. 2 the dry biscuit on the Big Jim."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is awesome. Who cares if it is hot outside, you won't be able to focus on anything else besides the incredible food."}
{"text":"Delicious. The food is bomb. It's tiny but you can make friends. I throughly recommend the big Jim. The chicken is the best. The greens are traditional and great. I bring everyone here to eat. Do yourself a favor and get in here."}
{"text":"This place is the Real McCoy!!! Most items are made in house and you can tell when you eat their food. The fried chicken that comes in any of their chicken n biscuit sandos is on par w the best Ive had anywhere. Its white meat but soooooo moist w perfectly crunchy breading. It is served w their biscuit that matches up w some of the best Ive had,  even in the Carolinas.  We also had the poutine, the PBB burger, the grilled cheese, mac&cheese (you can choose toppings; we had brussel sprouts and confit tomato), and the beignets(served in a dish of honey and powdered sugar). They were all outstanding you can taste the love thats put into making this food.  Its picnic/family style seating in an outdoor patio that lights up nicely at night. If youre travelling to this place to eat, we already have something in common so i dont mind sitting w strangers."}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ sauce chicken, always get the breast and whatever bacon donut is available, paired with a cold brew for an amazing lunch! It's been quite a while since I've been, will have to come back and make sure everything is as it was; delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here before but missed the point. Who would've thought a truck stop -looking place with po' boys and fried green tomatoes would serve organic veggies, grass fed beef burgers, free range organic chicken?  All well disguised as post-soul food.  Wow. Gin and tonic made with their homemade lemongrass infused soda water-- oh yes"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about Welcome Diner is that I always crave it on Mondays when they are closed! This is our go-to late night spot when we need some comfort food. But Welcome takes comfort food to another level. They use local QUALITY ingredients and I am a firm believer that this makes ALL the difference in food. We have tried lots of things on their menu: all of their biscuits and gravy. The Big Jim with fried chicken is my favorite. ALWAYS add a fried egg. Burgers. Poutine. The shredded pork fries and jackfruit meat vegan fries. We've tried a number of their specials. I ALWAYS get an order of their brussel sprouts. Beignets. I have never ever been disappointed here. Thank you for being you, Welcome Diner."}
{"text":"We met our daughter and her wife on the patio on a beautiful January night. The actual restaurant is very small, but plenty of space outside. Great vibe, very community oriented. Not a huge beer selection, but had a number of good craft beers available, and wine and some interesting sounding mixed drinks. The burgers we ordered were excellent. Everything on the menu sounded great. Looking forward to our next visit to try something different. Maybe one of the Jack fruit entrees."}
{"text":"The Big Jim is right! I was recommended by the staff and the locals. Specially made biscuit, smothered cheddar cheese, lots of crunchy bacon and a big slab of fried chicken with lots of gravy!!! To top it off with refreshing watermelon to cleanse your palate!"}
{"text":"If they had a better seating situation (for AZ) and to go containers for drinks, they would get a 5....and maybe if they were open at lunch. But either way, if you don't mind sitting outside and waiting until diner it's more than worth a trip! My fav is the champion!"}
{"text":"Best place in phx! I love the jack fruit sandwich! It's a fun atmosphere with great people."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix last week looking for a cool place to eat and decided to try Welcome Diner based on the other reviews.  I was not disappointed!  It was an amazing experience!  It is in the middle of a residential area but they have a lot of property and plenty of seating for guests outdoors.  We were fortunate to be able to sit inside.  They have 9 bar seats inside the \"trailer\".    The menu offers lots of delicious options - Waldorf Salad, Poutine, Fried Chicken on a biscuit, Fried Green tomato sandwich, fish, burgers, etc. and during happy hour, they offer reduced prices on some menu items!  Everything is made-to-order and if you are inside, you can see your meal being made.  They also have unique drink options and they are very tasty!!    The staff are really upbeat and friendly.  We got to chat with one of the guys who worked there.  He seemed really nice and genuinely cared about each guest's experience.  It is a really cool place."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great price, and great service. The patio is fun and people watching the neighbors as they walk by just adds to the uniqueness of this food truck turned restaurant. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"What a treat! The Welcome Diner really encompasses the Downtown Phoenix \"feel\". They had the actual old, historic diner building shipped from the east coast, completely renovated, and plopped right in Downtown!  Come here for the righteous chicken sandwiches and greasy burgers! A PBR will sweeten the deal, if the laid back, back-yard ambiance doesn't do it for ya."}
{"text":"Amazing, been twice and would go every week if I lived downtown. The food is incredible, the environment is chill, and the proprietors are super friendly. It's only open Sun.-Tuesday and will close for good 4th of July. Go while you can!!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place! The chicken biscuits are out of this world. So far I have tried the Captain Fantasy (talk about a kick) and the Bumble Bee (made with locally sourced honey) both have been fantastic. I have also had the Carol which is Kilt Lifter braised pulled pork on a biscuit, smoked in the back of course.   The service has always been really friendly. The atmosphere is really laid back.  You will want to eat outside, as the inside is really small.  Pretty much the opposite of the Tardis (a little geek joke, nod if you get it).  My Step son recently got one of their burgers, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  Definitely on my list to try soon.  All in all, its a place you have to try. You will not be disappointed in any way. oh did I mention that they are locally owned and locally sourced? So not only can you get good food, but feel good about it to."}
{"text":"Let me cut to the chase: the flavors here are absolutely superb. If you're looking for robust and full-bodied comforting flavors with original pairings at a budget-friendly rate: this is a fantastic choice. I'm in love with this location and their menu and I've barely made a ding in their menu! As an undying sweets foodie, I tried two of their desserts first: the tepary bean spiced custard pie with cornmeal crust and a hibiscus whip, and a salted bourbon caramel chocolate chip pecan pie slice.   ...there's a reason why I don't have photos. I went in for a sample and couldn't stop! I ate both slices in the time it takes to breathe two breaths and they were stunningly good!! The salted caramel chocolate chip pecan pie was really the standout if you like thick, decadent, heavy flavors (so for many, consider sharing with a loved one!) The tepary bean spiced custard pie reminded me a lot of a version of pumpkin pie with both texture and flavor...which has everything to do with the \"spiced\" component of the pie. There was also included a hibiscus whip which actually separated and added a sweet essence that enhanced the flavor and separated the textures of the slice. Definitely something unique and try-worthy, but maybe not a repeat buy (it isn't for me).  Cons: parking is difficult and all street oriented, and the hours...this is definitely not a location good for pick-up around end-of-work day, it's a commitment to an evening at the restaurant type of place. Heads up of menu changes: sometimes they are last minute (via Instagram posting) and shortly lived (don't always plan on offerings being available multiple days in a row)...for someone driving from Peoria, I appreciate a greater heads up so I can adjust my schedule to drive down for the exciting eats...  Will I be back? Very likely and next time I'm hoping to dig into some savory plates! (Pb&j burger, I got my eye on you!)"}
{"text":"Do you love good food? Duh. Do you love good drinks? Of course. Do you love good people? Who doesn't?! If you've answered yes to any of these questions (and we both know you did), you need to get down to The Welcome Diner. The cozy quarters and kitchy decor make it easy to fall in love with, and the staff makes you comfortable enough to stay for hours. AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words.  Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, \"HURRICANE!\" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys.  So, next time you're out and about downtown Phoenix on a weekend, you should go say hi, and then eat your face off. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have eaten almost everything on the menu at least twice I think.  Bloody Mary, hurricanes are well done and there is a good beer selection. High quality food in a relaxed setting."}
{"text":"I'm not a hipster but I still fell in love with ambience of this place. They have a bigger outside dining area than the inside. My go to is pulled pork fries and chicken and biscuit. They have a sweet HH deal too!"}
{"text":"I received an invite from a co-worker to meet here for dinner and had no idea what to expect. Having \"Diner\" in the name is misleading. It is an old diner and has lots of character. But the name is more appropriate if it references the patrons.  The food is amazing and creative. I am not the kind of person who seeks out locally sourced anything, but it really sets this place apart! They make their own ginger beer for crying out loud...  If you're near downtown and not afraid to go a little off the beaten path, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly, the decor was kitsch & cute but the rest of the experience was underwhelming. I don't understand the hype.  Drinks were standard but the food was bland. Deeply offended that their idea of poutine includes melted cheddar over fries - nope... Just nope. Curds or bust. The watermelon in my salad was unripe and left much to be desired. Burger fell apart and was an absolute mess.  Gave this place a second shot and it fell short again. Disappointing."}
{"text":"everyone employee was super personable. very nice, very laid back. great drinks, great food. dinner for 2 was like $30 + tip. my partner and i are new to the area. we felt very welcomed here at the welcome diner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love every single food item I have ordered. Delicious PB burger, Pork fries and \"Big Jim.\" The wait for food is very slow, so make sure you have time but it's just a part of the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there again today with family from OOT, they loved the food and the atmosphere. Just a fun, cool place, come on down."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! This place has such a weird/ funky vibe with its red and white diner, mismatched patio furniture, and staff running around yelling out customer names. Each time I have come the food has been great but the wait is usually long. As expected, I stood in line for a while last night to place my order. Occasionally, the person taking orders will slide the window closed and the line will have to wait. While this seems a bit annoying, it gives the cooks time to catch up and the staff time to get hot food delivered to tables.  Upon his return, the guy at the window was upbeat, kind, and open to offer suggestions. The food took a bit under 10 minutes to come out but was VERY good and obviously fresh. We had a salad and the Koko chicken sandwich with a side of brussel sprouts. I would definitely recommend this place as long as you have time to hang out!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Mac n cheese with bacon was insane!  Couldn't believe how much bacon they put in it.  Portions are huge!  Had to wrap most of it to go."}
{"text":"\"If it's savory, throw an egg on it.\" -Guy w/ the galaxy hat. Also I highly recommend trying the Kentucky Thorough Bred drink #Superb"}
{"text":"Favorite place in the valley. Hands down. I really wish they were closer to where I live so I could indulge more. I'm a total weirdo and LOVED their PB&J burger. It satisfied every pregnancy craving I could imagine. After I had my baby I enjoyed their wonderfully strong hurricane...so good! This place is best to be enjoyed on a hot monsoon night! Sticky air with the smell of rain and an ice cold hurricane..so much yes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great vibe, phenomenal food, vegan friendly, amazing burgers, good beers."}
{"text":"I live one block away. I've been going there for years now. There's a reason why they are always busy. The food is always delicious the wait staff is courteous and everything you would expect them to be. I would recommend this hidden gem to anyone."}
{"text":"Got in late on a flight and was famished. It was either the Welcome Diner or a fast food joint. This place was amazing! So many awesome dishes to choose from biscuits to burgers to the specials of the day. Definitely a place to frequent - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best ginger beer in town!!! Food is all incredible.  Try the whole menu. Always fun to sit inside.  Hurricanes are delicious and I vote it best place to be on new year's eve!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH  we've been meaning to go here for a few years now and honestly I'm sad we've waited this long. The Welcome is super casual, a little hidden gem in down town Phoenix. There is bar style seating inside but we chose to sit outside, we got there at 7:30 and our wait was super short ! By the time we left, crowds were picking up, and it gets busy fast !! We shared poutine fries ( which were so yum ) my husband had the jambalaya ( talk about flavor town) and I had the Big Jim biscuit which was incredible. I had a drink and my husband had a beer. The food was so fresh and from scratch, and made with lots of love.  We want to come back and brings lots of friends to enjoy the easy going atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here, but this place is the best because once a year they put on a local 24 hour movie festival where they challenge local film makers to go out and make a movie in 24 hours. The have to use a line of the organizer choosing the script as well as a prop of some kind. It's so much fun when they have the viewing and awards party the following weekend. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delish Bumblebee  and  Big Jim biscuit and the Hurricane, YUM!!!  Such a cute atmosphere.  Great part of our trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Don't really see what all of the buzz is about. Decent atmosphere, but the menu items are majorly overpriced in light of the quality on the day of my visit. Plain biscuit was $4 and about the same quality as a Waffle House biscuit that sells for 1/3 of that."}
{"text":"First time here and I have no problem giving them five stars.   We had wonderful service provided by Mikey and Drea.  Clayton was the chef and man can he cook. Wonderful food, fun and personality.  Highly recommend the big Jim!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. I saw this place on the local news TV station. And wanted to try it out. I went with my sister. It's located in the middle of a residential neighborhood. It's a quirky place with outdoor seating only. The small building looks like a diner. The employees were really pleasant and helpful. I ordered the Big Jim, my sister had the Fried Green Tomatoe Sandwich. We had fries on the side. The fries and dip that went with them were fantastic. Something in the dip gave it a tangy flavor. The fries were nice and crisp. As soon as I bit into the Big Jim, I thought how heavenly it was. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The combination of fried chicken , bacon, and gravy on a biscuit was fulfilling and scrumptious. The Big Jim was almost too big. I could barely finish it. My sister said her sandwich was fantastic and tasty. I would highly recommend this diner to anyone. My only beef with this place is it doesn't open until 5 pm."}
{"text":"Great comfort food...happy hour Tuesday is awesome.  Go hungry and then don't eat the next day to make up for it.  Pork fries were just awesome."}
{"text":"In the din of a South Central Phoenix neighborhood lies a throwback gem serving up some of the most creatively constructed southern comfort dishes this side of Paula Deen's mint julep soaked dreams. Run by a bunch lads that seem to be the progeny of a hipster-hippy relationship gone incredibly right the place has a great atmosphere and spot on service to match their menu.  A definite must stop when you make your many forays in the increasingly attractive downtown corridor."}
{"text":"A brand new Welcome Diner location where you can actually sit inside during the blistering Phoenix heat! and the women that attend me is too friendly, her name is Ana"}
{"text":"Love the old diner feel. This place was absolutely delicious! I had the welcome burger & fries & my bf had the big jim. Both perfection!! I can't wait until next time so I can get the biscuit ;)"}
{"text":"Best comfort food in the Valley! Absolutely nothing fancy and the wait is sometimes long, but WELL worth it. I've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Reasonable prices and a friendly hard working staff. Hate to share this and risk more people going but this place deserves every bit of great exposure it can get."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Welcome Diner.  It has my type of feel. I've been a few times and I love bringing guests from out of town here. The counter service outside is outstanding. The guy, I forgot his name, generally works the window and is patient and helpful. He's cool. Like the hip friend that knows about good and drink and can guide you around a really fun menu to get you what you want.  Went with the peanut butter burger, one of the fried chicken biscuit plates and a jackfruit French fry dish that just murdered my expectations.  There's a cool inside spot but it's always full when I get there. I have sitting inside at welcome on my bucket list. The bartender is always entertaining a fun crowd.  Keep opening up fun places and turning around Phoenixs food culture!"}
{"text":"To whoever established this place: thank you.  The food is amazing.  And not just for food that is available late at night or compared to other \"diner-type\" establishments, but truly high-quality dishes that stand on their own.   The outside setup is perfect.   The lighting creates a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.  This is not a fast food place.  You will have to wait for your order, so don't expect miracles.  Because food this good requires love and attention, which the Welcome Diner provides in abundance."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Welcome burger with the mac and cheese (highly recommend the mac&cheese!!!!!!) Also had the dessert biscuits with the goat cheese and jam - amazing! Def worth it for my first time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow. WOW. WOWWWWW!   Man. THIS PLACE. Fantastic. Utterly awesome inside and out.   The patio scene here is great. The food is great. The jams are great. The people are great. This is an all around great spot to grab some delicious food. I tried the fish po'boy, the PB burger (name?), and the fries with pulled pork. All were choice. Hell, even the coleslaw is pretty damn tasty. Check this place out, sit back, take it all in (the neighborhood adds a little bit of sketch to the whole thing, but it makes it feel kinda quaint), and get stuffed. Oh, and be sure to put hot sauce on everything.    Jesus, I am still in a food coma..."}
{"text":"Hello, I am so glad to be home in Phoenix for a few days!  Of course I stopped @ Welcome Diner my first night. I haven't had a true burger in about six months so.....I splurged with the Champion plus onions and it did not disappoint!!!  Fresh, juicy, with crunchy bacon jam....HEAVEN!  The side of fries was delicious as well....crispy/hot. This place has literally the best burgers in the Phoenix metro area!  If you are here in Phoenix and you eat meat this is the place to get your burger!!!!  If you do not eat meat, this is the place to get your fried green tomatoes sandwich!   this place!     Sent the husband and my daughter to the new digs for some takeout. Old location was definitely an eat there kind of place. The new location is too!  My dinner was yummy, but my family came home with stories of employees that were a little rude or stressed????  I have alway experienced kindness and respect at the old location. So...I am not sure what happened tonight. Plus, the menu has changed a little. Where is the peanut butter burger???  I love you Welcome Diner. Please get it together!!!  I NEED you to be as good or better than the old location!!!!"}
{"text":"Not your ordinary diner food , but with a great twist on food and drinks. A culinary find.  They use only the best and freshest local ingredients. Daily salads are a work of art.  Great people serving great food."}
{"text":"Found this AMAZING little Gem while looking for some street art in the Phoenix Art District. A MUST try and MUST visit for good home cooking, we had the Big Jim. Went on Saturday the vibe was super chill , they had a DJ playing a dope mix and all the people super nice. Would come back here for sure my next visit back to PHX"}
{"text":"I would like to tell you how terrible the food is here... that way you'll stay the hell away and leave it all to me.   Seriously though, I don't even know how to explain how amazing the food is here. Best biscuit, best gravy, best mac & cheese.  After the person sitting next to me at the counter left, I ate his leftovers right off that dirty plate (not kidding). That's how good it was."}
{"text":"The old Welcome Diner is closed, but it is now (temporarily) inhabited by Chef Payton Curry. Check out the reviews here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix"}
{"text":"fried green tomato sandwich will always have my heart"}
{"text":"I really wish that I had never eaten here because I can't stop thinking about it!  I constantly think about the amazing earthy flavor of the peanut butter burger!  And the bbq is the most legit bbq sauce I have had since I moved here from Memphis!  Try this place out before the prices soar and it gets inundated with hipsters and yuppies!"}
{"text":"Classic diner food and drinks with a twist. We came here on First Friday to try out something new as we're typically inclined to hit Angel's Trumpet. This place is a true diamond in the rough that you would end up passing by if you didn't know what you were looking for. I got the Chicken Philly which was on special that night. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the bread was toasty, the peppers and onions were super tasty, and the cheese sauce was on point. Everyone else loved their food as well, apparently the No Way Jose burger is a must order. I had a great cocktail as well to top everything else and 4 others split 2 bottles of wine. Line to get food and to be served was a little slow, but expected on a busier night. And if the prices were a tad cheaper I'd rate this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Holy shit!! You must eat here!! I live in the Bay Area and I still get cravings for that sandwich with buffalo sauce and blue cheese on it!! Why can't they be here in CA?! And that front porch tho!!! So sunny and warm! The staff and the customers who come here are awsome!"}
{"text":"Down home southern style cooking in downtown Phx. The fried green tomato sandwich is a home run. Also recommend the mac n' cheese as a side to share with your friends, it's a large tasty portion. There's a bartender inside that makes great a great old fashioned. The seating is first come first server and there's no table service (unless you sit inside at the bar which seats about 8 people). Have one person wait in line to place your order an another hold down some spots during busy hours."}
{"text":"Meh.  As someone who lives in Louisiana, I'm very Leary of any place that sells \"Louisiana\" foods. The food lacked seasoning/flavor. Very underwhelming. Atmosphere was nice with pretty lights and outdoor seating. Staff was kind."}
{"text":"There aren't words... Just go. Like... Stop what you're doing and get here. Get chicken or burgers or pork fries... WHO CARES?! It's all so f*ing good!!!!"}
{"text":"The Koko Biscuit deserves an award. Whenever we're out in Phoenix, we always have to drop by for a bite.  Many reasons make this place so great and always packed. 1. Their food. They don't serve anything here that isn't noteworthy. They just GET IT. Comfort food with a modern twist and yummy drinks. I'm always in. 2. The atmosphere is very welcoming and homey. Definitely embodies the \"Welcome\" part in their name. Their dining area inside is tiny. Basically a bar top and that's it. Most of the seating is outdoors, but they made it a cozy spot with the decor. This is quite a nice social/dining spot. 3. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They're very casual as if they're your friends lol. Again, treating you welcomingly with none of that extra restaurant server etiquette.  4. THE KOKO BISCUIT ALONE   Just come. If you're in the area, you might as well. I really wish we had one of these in LA."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to find this place but I'm so full of regret that I've missed out.  I don't know how they make their fries but I know it's the best fries I've ever had. I also loved the ginger beer that is house made. It really spicy but that's what makes it so delicious. I also had a perfectly cooked burger that was so juicy. The staff are equally quirky  and cool as the menu as I found myself dancing in my seat at the bar.  I will definitely be back and I am so mad I've been here so long and never knew this amazingness was here"}
{"text":"Visited Welcome Diner last week during their happy hour and got a few dishes and a couple of drinks. My wife got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork fries. Chicken sandwich was really good. Nice texture on the piece of fried chicken and a really fully biscuit. Great job on this sandwich guys. Add a little bit of Crystal hot sauce and that makes it even better. Pulled pork fries were good. The fries are smothered in pulled pork and then dressed with some kind of mustard based sauce which gives it a really nice tang. I think the fries could have been a little more crispy since they have to hold up to so much stuff. Also, the coleslaw on the fries give it an extra layer of texture. I wasn't too crazy about the old fashioned. It was way to sweet for me. Other then that, great food and I will return for that chicken sandwich especially."}
{"text":"Perfect weather this time of year to enjoy this unique little outdoor diner. Good spot for late night eats if you get hungry. As much as I like this little restaurant the food wasn't amazing. With all the great reviews I had higher expectations. Maybe after you've had a few drinks it would be amazing. Completely sober, it would not be something I would go out of my way to visit! Still like this place though."}
{"text":"The Welcome Diner was a difficult place to write a review about and you'll see why in a second. In order to capture my whole experience here, I'll interview myself (not at great detail or this post will be too long). Here it goes: WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THIS PLACE? When we pulled up to the restaurant at 9:00pm on Tuesday night, I was somewhat perplexed. There were about 20 people in the \"patio,\" which was comprised of various picnic tables, patio furniture, and what appeared to be a bar table that sat atop the fence that enclosed half the perimeter of the dining area. There was an eclectic mix of people. I noticed people of all ages and walks of life. Included in the mixture were some nurses, kids that looked like they were on probation (one of which was spitting tobacco), and one guy who kept alluding to his belief that he made his living doing stand-up comedy. As I started parking my rental car, I noticed this place is in the middle of a somewhat shady neighborhood. Not too comforting when I had to park a block away and walk past a house with a man smoking some substance on his porch. HOW WAS THE FOOD? The food was awesome! We ordered the Fish Po' Boy, the mac and cheese with chorizo, and the beignets. The sandwich was perfect. The whitefish was grilled nicely and the slaw was great. The mac and cheese was fantastic. I couldn't stop eating it. And the beignets? Those were a good end to a delicious meal. WOULD YOU GO BACK? Well, given the nature of the location and layout of the restaurant, I would typically say no. But the food was so good, I am interested in trying everything else on the menu. I guarantee we will come back. Specifically to try the poutine fries and the Champion burger. And the biscuit sandwiches. And sausage gravy. I would ask more questions of myself but I think I'd end up writing too much about food on the menu I didn't get an opportunity to eat..."}
{"text":"I'm one of those Yelpers who passively reads reviews but rarely writes one. I only write reviews when A meal is inexcusably terrible, or when a meal ..... Hold on I have to eat these beignets before I finish my review.... Ok I'm back...... Or when a meal is so delicious that it makes me moan with ecstasy . As you may have guessed, this is a  review inspired by the latter.  I'm usually a silent eater , but I was literally moaning and groaning the entire meal.   Generous portions, very friendly (and cute) staff, and ummmmmm. ..... Secret menu desert selections. I won't even attempt to try to put the meal into words because the description wouldn't do it justice. So just check out the pics below. I was almost hesitant to write this review bc I didn't want more people to come to this place, but these guys deserve all the credit ! Good job Welcome Diner! I am a believer !   Pictured: the big Jim, PB burger, poutine (the one Canadian export I enjoy), and super secret beignets with peanut butter, honey, and raspberry pear preserve."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Small and casually intimate atmosphere with friendly cooks.  Really loved the beet salad!"}
{"text":"I am from out of state and was here on yelp looking for a good restaurant. This restaurant came up first on the list. So I decided to go and have dinner.  It was extremely packed! Waited for half hour to give my order. No! I will not give a lower star because they were packed and I had to wait.  I ordered the white fish sandwich, pricey but delicious. Met a young couple. They were extremely nice and allowed me to join them and talk to them. No, this is not Los Angeles, where people are antisocial!  Enough of my rant! Place is awesome, food is tasty, and people and customer were extremely nice!"}
{"text":"This place is both fun, hip and cool to be at AND the food is just phenomenal. I can't wait to go back again and again to try everything!!"}
{"text":"I tried Welcome Diner after a co-worker recommended it. It's definitely one of my favorite spots to go to now if it's cool out at night or if I'm in the downtown area.  FOOD: I had the Big Jim Fried Chicken Biscuit Sandwich which was heavenly perfect comfort food. Biscuit was perfect and so was everything really. The side of watermelon is unique yet complimenting to most of their dishes. My friend got a side of fries and one of the burgers. I helped destroy the fries, they are seasoned and fantastic, especially with their special dipping sauce! On a second occasion, I tried a Coconut beer they had which sounded weird, but they give tasters and it was actually really good.  SERVER: No server really. Just go up to the window after reviewing the menu and order. They've always been friendly when I've asked questions and after you seat, someone will bring your food and condiments as needed. Pick your beer up at the window, though, the server can't do refills apparently.  HOSTING: No hosting, just sit yourself down outside where most of the seating is at, under the night sky. There is space inside but it's very tiny -- maybe 6-8 people max.  AMBIANCE: Outdoor seating mostly that's fenced off with patio / outdoor style tables. It fits perfectly with the trailer-diner vibe. Also, the string lights above are perfect. Excellent for chilling with friends or for a casual romantic date.  PARKING: I usually park on the East side across the street; There's a Water Mill station with some parking and late at night, that seems to be where other people park as well. Otherwise, down one of the side streets works too.  Albeit a bit of a hipster crowd every time I've gone (to be expected in the Downtown Phoenix area), it's still a pretty awesome neighborhood spot. Love the overall vibe of the place. Reminds me a lot of what they have in New York City -- a small place on the corner amongst a residential area.   Best to come here when it's cooler out at night! I'm only giving 4 stars because it's primarily outdoor seating, which poses a problem if it unexpectedly rains or if it's summertime because even at night, anywhere from May-September it's still 100+ degrees out and can ruin a date night. Otherwise, this is highly recommended as a unique restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! The ambiance was perfect and the company was even better. I only had a beer, but the staff made it an awesome experience. They were all very knowledgable and took the time to give us a background on the diner and what their thoughts and inspirations were for the Welcome Diner going forward. I am so excited to come back this weekend and try out some of the grub, because it looked and smelled amazing! If you are looking for a cool vibe, amazingly gracious staff and a chill place to have a beer (or 7), you should absolutely check this place out! Congrats guys, you are off to a great start!"}
{"text":"There was a little blurb of a review in the Arizona Republic newspaper over the Thanksgiving weekend about the Big Jim Sandwich and the Beignets here. Beignets, you say? Yes please.  I thought it would be a good place to take dear papa for lunch; turns out they open at 5 pm. So we made our way through rush hour traffic from north Phoenix to this \"middle of nowhere\" place on a Tuesday night. I expected small but I didn't expect teeny tiny. However, the warm and genuinely friendly service- YEP we felt WELCOME - more than made up for the close quarters. Our fish po'boys  and beignets in local honey were SUPERB! Totally worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the wife and kids. It would have been a great night to sit out on the patio, but we were happy we chose to take up 4 of the 9 seats inside this charming old and very small diner.   The staff were very friendly and we all enjoyed watching their team get the food out of that tiny kitchen. We were made to feel very welcome and in speaking to the staff it was obvious that they had great pride in the restaurant. They passed along some history on the building, formerly from Winslow. We loved the fact that we were sitting in a piece of genuine Americana.   Ordered the andouille corn dogs and pulled pork topped fries for a starter, they were great! The Mac n cheese, burgers and chicken biscuit that followed were also excellent. We washed them down with pumpkin porters and bottled cokes. And the beignets we were served for dessert were equally delicious.   Bottom line. We left stuffed and happy. A very memorable meal produced by a great team. We will be back."}
{"text":"What can I say....you must check it out. Friendly staff, great food and fun outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"Extremely limited menu, extremely limited parking and you must eat outside in 100+ degree weather. We left without ordering."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I had the whitefish po-boy and ice tea.  My friends had biscuit sandwiches And a couple cocktails, rave reviews all around!"}
{"text":"Probably my new favorite place ever. No seriously   1) I would come here purely because it's such a comfortable atmosphere, this place has an eclectic vibe that makes any person feel comfortable in their own skin  2) I have no words for the service. It's been so long since anyone in a restaurant has treated me like a person, given honest recommendations and put time and effort into their craft.    3) The food is decadent in moderation, creative without being threatening and amazing in my mouth.    The only disclaimer I have is that you need to remember that good things come to those who wait, this place gets really busy and has a tiny prep area and bar but they make it work with grace and expertise. Just enjoy the scenery and your patience will pay off ."}
{"text":"What a little gem this place is. I really loved the cozy feel of the place. Mostly outdoor seating or you can eat inside at the bar. The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly! I got the PB & B which turned out to be really good. Who would have thought peanut butter on a burger would taste good , but with the bacon and pickles it all came together very nicely . My fiancé got the  Koko which was a fried chicken a homemade biscuit with chipotle sauce and that was also delicious! I definitely will be coming back ."}
{"text":"If you avoid the chain restaurants in downtown Phoenix, you won't have a bad meal.  Welcome Diner is no exception.  The burgers are amazing, and they have great cocktails to boot.  I really wish I could get food like this in my hometown."}
{"text":"Great late night spot.  Food is awesome!  Staff is chill and personable.  Drinks are yummy!  Only bummer is the longer ticket times.  BUT it's well worth the wait.  Always coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. 2 times to eat and once I forgot cash. The first time was not great the fryer was down and the fry's sucked.   The 2nd time was a little better. Except the food inspector was there. Normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything.   We ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke. One burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both. I was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one. (I should have though, I do not care for onions on the burger) The fry's were good, in fact I could have eaten another order.   The cook Andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke, ketchup, other peoples meals, the \"regular\" got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure Andy knew it was 2 singles...  The other \"regular\" looked as if she rolled out of bed, smoked a J, slapped her over sized headphones and Ipod in her PJ pocket and rode her bike here. She totally dumped her bike in the front, like she owned the place. Andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head didn't get it.   Andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there, not sure what but he was outside for a while.    I like Welcome but with 2 issues in 2 visits I dunno If I will be back."}
{"text":"I think I'm being nice with three stars...but I seriously had high hopes for this place! My friend and I came here so pumped to try this hidden treasure.  Our drinks were on point. I got the Hurricane and my friend got a Whiskey Sour. Then the food came out fast. Maybe too fast.   We both got a burger. One was the one with the jalapeño slaw and the other one with peanut butter. I kid you not, the biggest concern was that the middle of the burger was practically raw. There was no grilled crisp to the burger and even the outside of the burger wasn't very hot at all. I'm hoping they were just busy and this was an off night because that was really disappointing.  To give them the benefit of the doubt, I did order a burger with peanut butter on it and it was the first time I've ever tried something like this but not only did I feel underwhelmed, my friend did also.  To top it off, the bill was over $20 and the food was sub-par. Will I try this place again? Possibly with some liquid courage."}
{"text":"Great food. Great little whole in the neighborhood.  Great people.  Recommend to anyone looking for good food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Magnificent food , love the Plant based options ! Great service and an even better atmosphere , lots of history in this kitchen and it continues to produce amazing exsperiences and amazing food !"}
{"text":"Awesome cool place...great place to hangout at night....I got the burger...medium...was yum toasted bun...the fries a little small but I ate everyone they were so good...cool relaxing place super friendly helping staff...a go to for relaxing hangout"}
{"text":"Quaint little place. My hipster friends love it, and I thought it was good, though it didn't quite live up to the hype. I do dig the look and locale, but the was a major bee issue the day I ate there. It was very hard to enjoy the juicy burger they cooked up for me while I was constantly ducking and dodging the damn bees. Though good, I felt it wasn't a lot of bang for my buck. $10 and some change for a burger and a side of hashbrowns (plus they ask for a tip on the tablet from which you order before you get served, which is kinda out of order). I'll still give it a 4 because this little place has heart...and character."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great vibe and food. Had a burger with a jalepeno jam. Wife had a chicken biscuit. Both great. Sat inside at the counter by the swamp cooler and made friendly conversation with the bartender. Nice service. The Last Word cocktail was spot on. Had a delicious custard pie for dessert with an apricot compote. Will be back."}
{"text":"We visited Welcome Diner on a Thursday evening and, in all, had a good experience but I can't say I plan to return. Though on the pricey side, the food was good (I had a BBQ pork plate and my guest a burger) and the menu selection seemed adequate. We sat outside and enjoyed our meals, sipping on hurricanes, while appreciating that Welcome Diner is, for lack of a better explanation, a hipsters diner done absolutely right. The food, the service, the facility...all are within a clear and well executed vision. And while I respect that vision, I think that, for me, it was just too much. Specifically, the outdoor seating is more stylish than properly relaxing as their comfort food is. Sitting at a picnic table or some old outdoor furniture that looks like it just came from the back of an old shed is too hipster for me. I get it. I get the theme. I get the execution. It just doesn't work for me. But I would definitely eat their grub if I were in the area looking for take out."}
{"text":"I've always been more than satisfied every time I eat at Welcome diner except today. I had the Koko and my BF had the no way Jose with a side of fries for take out. Serving was smaller than if we would have had dined in. Chicken was dry. Will make sure to dine in next time instead of getting it to go."}
{"text":"This place was off the hook!! As I say, \"hella good\"! Like hella gooooooooooooood! I strongly recommend this place especially with a group of friends around sunset to kick back at this chill establishment with cool outdoor lighting and throw back some drinks before your meal.   By the way, if you gotta whizz...prepare to step into an airplane sized bathroom literally right next to the kitchen...so hopefully you will not need to DO anything else there...haha  Great eats tho, everyone in my party loved their dishes. Cheers.  JP@"}
{"text":"Still the best place! I had the jackfruit po-boy and it was awesome! also, the dirty beignets were Delish. In fact, I wanted to take a picture but we ate them too fast. Just go."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked forever and ever and was very excited to finally have the opportunity to try it out. As we all know, that can lead to much disappointment but that just was not the case. The food here is as legit as my fellow yelpers have given it credit. For dinner, my wife and I tried to Poutine, the Big Jim, and the PO Boy Sandwich. Here our my thoughts:  Poutine-fries, gravy, and cheese....enough said. The gravy here is amazingly good. My only regret is not having my daughter with me to try it, as she loves a good gravy.   Big Jim-This dish is what one would expect from a five star dish. It was so dang good!!!!!!! Homemade biscuit, gravy, fried chicken, bacon, and cheese. Come on, how could it be better? It couldn't.....this thing was awesome. If you check out my wife's future review, I guarantee she will mention wanting this dish as her last supper. Perfect in every way!!!!  PO Boy- Good dish but not the Big Jim kind of good. My wife liked her sandwich and it was good, but not great. The fish and bread were very fresh. Our only thought, and what do we know, but thinking a dipping sauce of some kind would make this dish so much better. Solid four star item.  Staff here were very outgoing and friendly. The outside seating was comfortable. We were fortunate to have an outside heater near us to keep us cozy.   The diner was all I was hoping it would be and glad I finally had the chance to go. Just wish the hours were more accommodating for their new west valley fans. Will go back for sure if in the area when they are open. A must visit."}
{"text":"This place is not my type of place to dine but a friend invited me so I went. The food was so-so to me. It was crowded and the service was a bit slow. All seating is mostly outside which made for fun people watching.  I would go back again but won't be a first choice."}
{"text":"Out freaking standing.  Great food.  Good service...VERY TIGHT INSIDE...but eh, I like the diner feel.  I had the welcome burger and he cooked it perfectly.  The poutine was delicious.  Very very good find for us.  Burger, Pabst, poutine and beignets.  Wow."}
{"text":"Literally the best Mac and cheese in town. I journey from very far just for that! I'd write more, but I'm too busy eating it right now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! It is so quaint and delicious. Southern cooking in downtown Phoenix. Everything I have ordered was fantastic. They have the friendliest people that work there. I also feel like I am just eatting at a friends house when I am there."}
{"text":"I love my Mac and cheese with extra sauce and Brussels sprouts and don't forget the second generation. It's phenomenal. For the most part the staff is super inviting and \"welcoming\". I've only had a couple experiences where I've felt like an inconvenience to them. Definitely not everybody there is like that!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All items on the menu are worthy to try them. My favorite one is the Koko (biscuit with fried chicken). The service is a bit slow but they are so sweet and cool that who cares?"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Really interesting menu.  I had the Koko, a biscuit with fried chicken with a great chipotle ranch sauce. I loved it and would defiantly get it again. My husband had the burger with bleu cheese and bacon, it was a bit overdone and the bun was burned but he's willing to give it another try.  Shared an order of Mac and cheese...definitely a winner with that recipe, it was delicious.  Ordered the beignets for dessert. They may have been the best I've ever had and that includes the originals from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  It's defiantly a young crowd and it gets busy but it was nice to just hang out and enjoy a beautiful warm night. The cocktail list is innovative and they know what they're doing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I stop by the experience exceeds my expectations. The food is quality, unique flavor pairings and the customer service is genuine, groovy and welcoming. When I have guests flying in town this is always my first stop after the airport! Welcome diner is life!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter, BBQ and burger. Who knew? Treat yourself to this fun little diner and you will find yourself laughing and talking to the other guests like we did. Great food with a great staff."}
{"text":"It's a cute little trailer/hipster restaurant in Phoenix (walking distance from ASU campus.)   My friend took us here for a late dinner when I was visiting and I'm glad he did.   The cashier was really nice and helpful especially when I asked what she recommended for food/to drink.  I ended up ordering a beer with the Carol which was a biscuit sandwich with pulled pork. It was a really big portion (ended up taking half home). The biscuit was nice and fluffy - a little too thick for me personally. The coleslaw was surprisingly good (I normally don't like it but found myself liking this one). Good place for a quick meal/to hang out outside."}
{"text":"They don't believe in customer service at the Welcome Diner.  Just hipster beards and mediocre cheeseburgers.  Sitting at an 8 top and the food runners can't take an order for us at the table and want us to wait in line?  This place is a hell hole."}
{"text":"Good food! good fun! Shout out to the ladies jumping rope late hours!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Brunch is a time I go regularly on the weekends.  Bloody Mary's? Yes please!! Some of the best in town. Dining al fresco?  Yes please!! Picnic benches and people watching. Wonderful southern style grub? Yes please!! Food is GREAT! Just perfectly greasy and flavorful. That's a compliment!!  Service? Excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. Prices....? A tad high, but sooooooooo worth it!!"}
{"text":"My family was driving through Phoenix and told me they were stopping here. I was confused at first, as I had never seen this place, and it appeared to be I. A neighborhood. Don't let that fool you, just go.   Everything was delicious. We got various different chicken biscuit sandwiches and burgers. Fries were great. Cole slaw was good, and I don't even like cole slaw. Very heaven food, may die after, but worth it at least once."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive service, great ambiance. Hip but not unwelcoming to middle-agers like me. It was a little more pricey than I was expecting but the food is locally-grown. The \"Carolina\" BBQ sauce on the pulled pork is mustard-based. Pretty good but not what I (or most people familiar with the typical Carolina red sauce) would have expected. Maybe the mustard-based sauce is more common in SC. Hamburger and lemon meringue pie were yummy. All around pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried this place after a friend recommended it to me. I ordered the Champion burger with fries. The burger was so good. It was perfectly juicy and the bacon jam was JAMMIN!  there is mostly outside seating. When we went the inside seating was all taken. They have really friendly staff, too! I can't wait to come back and try more of the food."}
{"text":"This is a food truck experience but the food truck doesn't move. The ambience is very causal, perhaps a few bar style seating inside and a picnic style outside dining area in a downtown neighborhood. Expect to wait 20 minutes or longer waiting in line to order at the window, it's worth it! We ordered the pulled pork biscuit and the fried chicken biscuit with honey and pickles, Poutine, and beignets. The hurricane(house made fruit punch) was delish! The biscuits are huge, fresh, and the perfect compliment to the fried chicken and pulled pork! The Poutine had the right amount of gravy and cheese and a very nice portion. The beignets were hot, moist, crisp and a great end to the meal. We are looking forward to going back and trying more awesome food, including the burgers that looked very tasty!"}
{"text":"Both Welcome restaurants are delightful. It's a little hip, very trendy, and super delicious. It's a little off of the main Roosevelt Row social areas, but is worth making it there. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Welcome Diner is truly welcoming. I love sitting indoors at the counter. The drinks are great and of course, the food is da bomb!! Love the chicken/gravy/biscuit sandwich.  Just be ready to be very very full and very satisfied after you're done eating.  Get the Kentucky Thoroughbred drink...so delish and I have the Welcome Diner to thank for turning me onto Four Roses Bourbon again!"}
{"text":"I had the chance to get into Welcome Diners new spot on opening night-- Wow! I could not believe how inviting and \"Welcome\" the new place is! The patio is still comfortable and inviting with that order at the window vibe! I cannot wait to bring my dog to the new place!! Inside they kept the same vibe at the trailer just bigger! The open kitchen concept is fun to sit at the bar and be a part of the action! The low booths are super comfortable and allow you to take it all in-- not to mention a Disco Ball!!! What?!?! So fun!!  On to the best part of 2.0-- THE FOOD!! YUM!! There are still my favorites from 1.0 (the amazing No Way Jose Burger and the Bumblebee!!) BUT NOW There are some new dishes that are too good to pass up: The Pickled Shrimp Toast is a must try!! Light and airy foam on toasted Noble bread-- ummm yes please!!! Seafood etouffee-- the rice was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of acid to balance the whole dish!! Chorizo Meatloaf: if my Nana made meatloaf--this would be it but better! The sauce on this dish is the right balance of flavors to leave an empty plate!! (I would have licked my plate, but people were watching!!) The desserts are just as tasty as before!!  The last mentionable is the cocktail menu!! The classics are still there - Hurricane!! (cheers from across the room) and then there are some new amazing drinks to help you settle into the comfy booths!!  Kudos to the whole Welcome Crew on the new spot!! I am craving another Welcome Diner fix!!!"}
{"text":"whenever we are in the area, we love to visit the Welcome Diner. Great Food. Great atmosphere. Some of our favorites are the Mac & Cheese, the sunrise biscuit, cheeseburger and the jambalaya. yum, yum, yum!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome staff, awesome scene! Get the pulled pork fries and fried green tomato sandwich! Don't think twice about this place, go now, go often! Your Chicago friends!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Bad for my cholesterol but who gives a damn! The proprietors are very cool, great ambience in \"the hood.\" It puts the soul in soul food; can't wait to hang out there again soon as my Lipitor digests; just cool as it gets in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Hipsters unite lol (so many hipster here I thought I was at some basket weaving gathering, or watever they are into now). Anyways place is relaxing and staff are friendly. Food was great and they are open late!"}
{"text":"This place couldn't be any cooler if it was renamed \"Jules Winfield's Welcome Diner\"  People.  Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.  The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.  My only beef (Heh.  Pardon the pun.)  is that Welcome Diner is closed on Sundays and that they force me to battle the tweakers at the 7th and Roosevelt Circle K as I spring for a pack of P-funks and a $20 bill due to their 'no cards' policy.  It would also be in my best interest if they started serving micro-brews from Oregon or Happy Land.  That would be right good."}
{"text":"Welcome Diner, there is a reason why you're so loved! The food, its delish!  I had asked the boys to join me many many times at Welcome Diner and each time just poop pooped on the idea, but this time I had them both in the car and they were hungry, so down the street we went and before they knew it I had already parked near WD!    They went kicking and screaming as I lead them to the order line, I shoved menus in there hand and soon the fighting was subsiding, and before I knew it they were already giving their orders....  I went with the Koko. It's a biscuit sandwich that has fried chicken topped with chipotle ranch, arugula and tomato, I bet your thinking this must be a small sandwich, but you would be wrong, the biscuits are almost bun size, they are cut in half and grilled in the middle, they have the perfect texture of a biscuit and hold of a bun, oh and that fried chicken, oh sweet lord, this was a great sandwich!  One ordered the PB&B (Peanut Butter & Burger) it was crunchy peanut butter, B&B pickles, bacon, cheddar on a burger, dude this was delish as well, don't think about it, just order it and try it out, I promise you wont be disappointed.  The other ordered Mac & Cheese, and well I can not personally testify for it I can say it was a hit, before I knew it, the bowl was empty and the kid had a smile.  We also ordered 2 orders of Beignets drizzled in local honey and powder sugar, 2 orders split among 3 gave each of us 2 perfectly fried pieces of dough heaven. This was the perfect way to end a great meal!  The boys are already hitting me up wanting to go again, since it's their area I'm sure we will be back before you know it!"}
{"text":"Back in 2005 I came to Welcome Diner and would enjoy really tasty breakfast sandwiches.  I loved the husband/wife team who took care of the customers and made the place pretty darn awesome.  I know in the past few years there've been a few different concepts that hit Welcome Diner... I didn't patronize the place since back in 2005/2006, but went back last night at about 9pm to check it out.  I took some of the pictures that are up on this Yelp review back then when I was DowntownGirl.  With my man and a friend of ours, we stopped over to the same quaint trailer that seemed to be a bit more polished up with a more bold \"Welcome Diner\" painted on the front, but pretty much looked the same from back when I used to go.  There was a special on the board and they had menus with some eclectic items.  Two of us chose the South Carolina-style pork sandwich on a biscuit and a side of fries while our friend grabbed the peanut butter bacon burger and some Sweet Republic ice cream.   We sat outside instead of in.  We also grabbed some wine and beer.  Local WINES!  So glad to be able to go to an establishment in downtown Phoenix where they offer local wine.   We got our food after a short wait and dove in.  Top notch delicious foods all around.  I know they have a brunch menu... guess we'll have to ride down some Saturday or Sunday morning.  Tasty food, friendly staff... we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here after work for a drink and a biscuit. The food is great, but it's the setting that makes this place awesome! It's very low key with limited seating and Christmas lights hanging in the trees. It's the perfect place to chill in a small group!"}
{"text":"Outdoor fun!!!! This little place knows comfort food BIGTIME!!!! Its a laid back atmosphere so if your looking for something fancy this maybe not for you but if you can humble yourself into appreciating good comfort food and a backyard setting then this is the place for you! Also, a great spot to stroll into in the morning after a huge night out on the town their Bloody Marys will make you feel just right again!!!"}
{"text":"Well, it finally got rented out again - to a troupe of really enthusiastic chefs and they're growing their hours. Worthy successors to the chefs who came before them, another tribe of locavores. Unbelievable that they seem to have a full beer/wine/liquor license.   GO NOW before everyone figures it out! However, be warned it is no longer \"cheap, under $10\" - but not by much - excluding our wine our shared meal clocked in at $15 each.  We each had a glass of Arizona wine labeled, merely, \"red\". Went wonderfully with our shared Roosevelt Growhouse salad [the beets, my gawd], cheeseburger [the mushrooms ...] and fries. Good decision, to share - we couldn't"}
{"text":"After an action packed Sunday Funday, Welcome Diner was just what was needed.  The unique food makes you wonder, at first,  if it's actually going to be good.  This is one place where not just the food speaks for itself...the service was great and the best part is how they actually bring the food out to you even though you order a food truck window."}
{"text":"We had burgers, fries, and a salad and everything was perfect and delicious. This is a thick burger with fresh toppings. Really yummy fresh salad with an amazing cheese on top -feta? Better than any feta I've ever had. But the real show-stopper for us was the fries. Very likely the best french fries we've ever had. They're not fancy, not dressed up, just perfection. The service was also fantastic. This is an order at the window mostly outdoor diner, but there was a guy who kept coming out and checking with each table, so it felt like sit-down service. We loved the friendly, casual vibe. Made for a very relaxing evening. I'll go out of my way to go back again. *My only wish is that they'd serve milk shakes. :)  Update 3/18- We've been back a few times and every time has been fantastic. This last time we tried the mac & cheese and now understand what everyone raves about! Yum! My husband says it's the best he's ever had, but that's the way with everything here.. best burgers, best fries, best service. I have no debate on this anymore, this is the best burger in the valley. Crazy good. And when's the last time you went to a order at the counter place where they introduced themselves, the cook, and assured you they'd be taking care of anything you need? And they do! Really wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Get a grapefruit Paloma and a burger to split; our favorite place when we visited Phoenix"}
{"text":"If you just landed in PHX and this place came up, just go.  Stop reading and get fed right.  Fried chicken on a fresh biscuit with a refreshing salad, served outdoors in what looks like someone's front yard.  Heck, I pulled up and almost pulled away but something told me to stop, give it a chance and boy am I glad I did.  Great service, to die for food.  You can really tell the chef loves what he does."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Welcome Diner last night. So, there were several different items ordered and EVERYTHING was so good!  I had the fried avocado po'boy. The bread was toasted the perfect amount. There was a great pico de gallo and kale topping the fried avocado. That fried avocado was amazing! It was so creamy yet crunchy! Yum! My husband had the champion burger. He said it was really good, especially the bacon jam. My brother in-law has the big Jim. It was huge! A biscuit, giant piece of fried chicken and the thickest gravy ever! I tried some and it was so good! Creamy and sinful! The last thing I tasted was the Brussels sprouts. Omg! Goooood! They were crispy and tasty! Only downside was the fries were a little salty. I would definitely go back. The atmosphere is exactly what downtown Phoenix is all about! I loved it!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is incredible. The menu is very simple and to the point. Don't let that fool you.   I got the sausage corn dogs. YUMMY. A must try. Also the fried green tomato sandwich. The bread they use is quality and so tasty.   I gave it 4 stars because I feel like the staff could be friendlier. And eventually, I'd love a bigger beer selection.   Try. This. Place."}
{"text":"The best place I have been with all of my roommates. Definitely as good as they say! This is such a perfect, unique place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are so utterly in love with this place.  Their menu is genius and you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  The poutine and the mac n' cheese are my go to's whenever we go here.    The seating is open and we love sitting in the 6-seater counter top in the old trailer they work out of.  Being practically an arm's reach away from the kitchen stove is awesome because you get to hear and smell the food cooking which is phenomenal. This is exactly what comfort food should be; greasy and flavorful and rich!  Another draw of coming here is where it is located.  Sitting on the street corner in the midst of older craftsman style historic homes and strung lights about their patio is so charming.  I love coming to this part of Phoenix, always great people-watching and fun atmosphere.   The staff here are so awesome and friendly and make the experience here that much greater!  I highly highly recommend this place if you are looking for amazing, local, FRESH food.   Just come here, period. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Welcome to AHHH-mazing.. at this cozy Welcome Diner! My exact words as I tried my first bite was, \"Ok.. this would be my last meal on earth if I had to pick one.\"  That is saying a lot considering my love for good food.  I'm not sure if I truly meant it or I was in a food coma  Either way, it's on a top favorite list now.   This place has charm and is sure to impress your tastebuds.  We sat outside on a rustic picnic table with white lights, heat lamps and ate some seriously good grub. The hubby got the \"Big Jim\" which I'm not sure I can find words to describe. A home made biscuit with the best gravy you could ever ask for, fried chicken and bacon under it all. One bite of this thing and you will be hooked.  I can't say enough about this dish.. just GET IT.  I went for the healthier grilled fish sandwich, which was loaded with flavor.  An extremely well seasoned piece of fish and some slaw on top.  We also got a side of fries smothered in the famous, fabulous, unforgettable gravy. This Diner also serves mixed drinks if you'd like to visit and kick back a while.   The Welcome Diner should be bookmarked on everyone's Yelp!  I'm not sure about the other items on the menu but I imagine they are outstanding."}
{"text":"Sheer deliciousness! Had the sunrise... It was in a biscuit, absolutely delightful, very filling and superbly made. To add to that, the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back, and the experience is very different from the normal fare.  The staff was pretty friendly and checked on us several times. (I guess it helps that you add the gratuity while ordering+paying, instead of after the meal?)"}
{"text":"I'm beyond impressed with my experience at Welcome Diner. The food and service was impeccable! If you haven't been I would highly recommend trying it! Thanks Aaron, Zach and Jose!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Very friendly!! We came on a Friday night so the kitchen was a little backed up but it was worth the wait. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Waited a long time to eat here went after leaving celebrity theater was amazing had the chicken biscuit and some drinks with the Brussels sprouts was delicious"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends on Saturday for brunch. Ordered the Big Jim and sunrise. The big JIM was a little salty and the sunrise just didn't hit the mark. The chorizo was excellent.  The holy puerco was the best dish, I highly recommend.   I will return for lunch and dinner to see if it gets better. I would recommend going at least once, don't be afraid of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Dear fucking lord I am not going to eat again until next Thursday.  A friend took me here for lunch today, in exchange for a little 'puter help. The cook is a friend of hers, he just said, don't worry I'll make something you like.  Next thing I knew I had a Scheiners freshly made hot dog, grilled, split open, on a bun... with a fried egg an some of their pepper concoction on top. One of the best things I have ever ever eaten.   As others mentioned, the fries are sliced to order and fried to a super crisp.  The eggs are organic. The menu is tiny, it's diner food, but the food quality is very, very high.   Has a few bites of a freshly made pear pie.... oh my.  I will be back, but not that often, otherwise I'll be a lardass. (again)"}
{"text":"love that its open so late. the food is really good and the hipster vibe is hilarious..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their jackfruit po' boy was amazing. It can be really hard to find good vegan food in the valley but this was a pleasant surprise and also my first time trying bbq jackfruit. The Welcome Diner is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Not exactly in a good appealing neighborhood. It was like a house in a corner converted into a small diner with tables set up in the yard... however the food was great and affordable. I ordered a jambalaya while my friend had the little birdy, fried chicken with cheddar... we both enjoyed the food and will be back for more"}
{"text":"The Welcome Diner was super WELCOMING, living up to its name! It was our first stop after landing in Phoenix. They treated us like old friends and made sure we knew the best spots to enjoy on our stay here.   The BBQ Jackfruit sandwich was bomb (NY slang for AMAZING!)   Really wish I could take the whole staff and restaurant back to New York with me. Thanks guys =D"}
{"text":"Honest comfort food in a sweet ass, remodeled RV and plenty of outdoor seating. Wayne (owner/manager?) said \"thanks, we try really hard\" when I complimented them on the food and experience. Yet, one of the greatest things about this place is they don't inundate you with being those people that try too hard. They don't force their efforts unto you, it just happens organically. Watching them work behind the bar and in the kitchen was a thing of beauty... so fluid, every movement and each interaction is performed with meaning and genuine care. It makes you feel at home while also being right in the middle of the action. Food and drink were fantastic and well priced ($6 old fashioned at happy hour??). Got the No Way Jose burger and fries, girlfriend got the same but with Brussels sprouts. The biscuit sandwiches and the poutine made my mouth water watching them pass by, but I didn't try them on this trip. Pecan pie . Recommend eating inside at the bar if there is seating, so you get the full on experience of the hustle and bustle behind the counter. Then, grab another drink and head outside if it's not 120 out. This place is a great way to start your evening. Compliments to Wayne and the rest of the staff!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Tucson and found this diner, here on Yelp. Driving to this place was interesting as it is in an old section just east of downtown Phoenix, could describe it as 'The 'hood', but as we drove up and saw the place and patrons lined up to order outside, I told my wife, 'we gotta do this' and it was very good! Try the 'Big Jim', it's delicious, my wife had the 'Welcome Burger' and she said it was one of the best burgers anywhere. They do have Craft beers and a bar, but you better like it 'kozy' 'cause that bar is inside this little trailer-like restaurant; seating for eating is outside. You really  should try this place, it's a cool, little place that will surprise you! Oh, save room for the Beignets!"}
{"text":"YOU.MUST.EAT.HERE!  Everything is to delish but the burgers are to die for. The blue cheese burger is by far my fave but on our last visit we found it had been removed from the menu because they rotate the burgers out. Hesitantly, I tried the peanut butter burger....and oh.my.god! The oddest concoction, but delicious!   Ps....please bring back ol' blue!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drinks, and serves food till 2 am. Definitely recommend the jambalaya, sooo bomb!"}
{"text":"Food is  an A-. Service is A+. Environment is A+++. My suggestion is to have more items in the menu."}
{"text":"When you see the building you might be like ew gross but then once you try the food you're like yummmm! I've been here a few times and always like my food! Drinks are good too! I would use the restroom before coming here though, the restrooms are somewhat hidden and I have heard they're not the best."}
{"text":"I finally have a great late night place. Perfect for late summer nights hanging out outside! I don't even live nearby and its still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Wow what amazing food and fantastic service. My group got 2 big jims, a bumblebee, poutine, and the welcome burger along with 3 old fashions. The drinks were served right away with the food very shortly after. All of the items were amazing and we will definitely be back many many many times."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I can't say enough good things about it. My cousin lives in downtown so whenever I'm in the hood this is where we always choose to go. Food is to die for!"}
{"text":"A couple friends took me there Saturday.  It was very tasty and affordable.  It's a very small place and they cook right in front of you, if you sit inside (like waffle house but not as greasy and more delicious) and very friendly staff and atmosphere.  We had beer and mimosas with biscuits and gravy (comes with bacon/sausage or mushrooms and an egg), blackberry ricotta lemon pancakes, and a chicken sammich with cheddar, apple butter, on a homemade biscuit."}
{"text":"We had just left the Arizona Science Center and were starving and looking for a nearby place to eat.  Welllll...my friend had this place bookmarked for some time and it was only about 5-7 mins down the street so we said hey why not  The restaurant itself is literally a little van of a diner with patio table benches set up. The line was pretty long to order and there are menus at the front to look at.   The food was different from what I normally am used to but I am open to new things so my friend and I shared two dishes. We had the sunrise and also the fried green tomato sandwich. We wanted some poutine fries but they were out of fries for the night.   What I highly enjoyed was their house made ginger beer! Honestly the best ginger beer I've had by far!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER SPOT I'VE COME ACROSS!! I was out one night craving a burger and jumped on yelp and happened to be driving down roosevelt. This was the first place that came up. I drove down and stopped by. This place is really cool. I like the open setup outside. There's benches for you and your friends to chill on while u enjoy your meal.  There's a dinner car that seats about nine people that's cool to sit in.  The service is GREAT!!! All the people there are super cool. A very friendly atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. When your foods ready they always check to make sure everything's right before giving it to you.  Now.... The burgers and catfish sandwiches are AMAZING!!! I have had the welcome burger, the peanut butter burger and the Friday night catfish poor boy!!! All left smiles on my face wanting more. You have to try this place out!!! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Man oh Man!!! What a GEM!!! Found this spot about a 1 1/2 years ago...L O V E their fried green tomato sandwich! Have taken my friends and foodie, adult children (runs honest in the family) And everything we've had has been fabulous.   How can you not enjoy such a unique spot - a 1945 Diner with 8 stools and fantastic outdoor seating?!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. IDK what Brentski is talking about. lol, I love the hurricanes and the pork fries."}
{"text":"This tiny neighborhood spot virtually looks like either a converted food truck or a small food trailer. Outside on the front lawn are many tables and chairs, as inside you will find only 9 seats at the very retro counter.  The menu is southern comfort food. Super greasy, generous portions, all cooked grilled and prepared in what is probably the smallest kitchen in the valley.  This is the spot for a behemoth burger, biscuits smothered in gravy, and even fried green tomatoes.  With a \"biscuits\" menu, featuring fried chicken drowning in country gravy, cheddar, and bacon - it is a bypass waiting to happen.  However, there are lighter healthier biscuit choices that come topped with sauteed Kale and fried egg...but this place truly is a destination for abandoning healthy choices and diving head first into fat and calories."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the Big Jim and it lived up to the BIG part, bacony and gravy-y and delicious. The coffee was good too. This is a great brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my girlfriend. First time in Phoenix , she wanted to take me to Braggs since she lives downtown but the wait was crazy. I had the welcome breakfast and it was the best breakfast I've had in a long time. The biscuit, hash browns and bacon were amazing, my girlfriend got the grilled cheese w the tomato confit and inhaled it .. guess it was pretty good! Loved it! Perfect new years day brunch!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to this gem last week, and I can't believe I didn't know about it! Welcome Diner is adorable, with friendly staff and a cool atmosphere. We went after work for happy hour, and it was a great experience. Highly recommend the koko biscuit and the hurricane! Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our food and the atmosphere. The service was amazing as well. Also loved fact they buy their food locally.  I got the champion burger and it was the best burger I've ever had anywhere. The bacon jam is really a hidden treasure. We'll be coming back hopefully every weekend. Thanks welcome diner for providing an awesome experience."}
{"text":"It's kinda southern comfort food with a hipster twist.  I'm a fan.  I hear they have an awesome \"after-hours\" scene on weekends.  When I'm in that kinda mood I will try it."}
{"text":"I got on a plane in Boston, landed in Phoenix, and went to the Welcome Diner.   There were a few other reasons for my visit, but retrospectively, there didn't necessarily need to have been. I'm not going to get into the particulars [see all other 5 star reviews], let me just contribute my humble \"YEEEUP\" to this wonderful little joints' reviews and be on my way.  Summation: Do you like food? GO HERE."}
{"text":"Hearty diner food with good flavors. Nothing extraordinary. Limited menu. Was hoping for an Acai bowl or green drink but that's not this type of place. The real downer was the small dining space which was super noisy and not cozy. Hipster place with a rustic industrial/farm decor. Overhyped but super popular with college crowd.  Friendly service:)"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend the cheese sandwich.  Love the heavy cream with smooth Blue House coffee."}
{"text":"Getting to Welcome Diner during rush hour traffic (5:30pm) was a bit of a hassle but was worth it. Upon arrival, situated randomly in a quiet little neighborhood on the edge of downtown, there was the most legit old school diner. With plenty of seating all out front and outdoors (avoid during the summer) the atmosphere was very hip and trendy.  The food was not that of the typical diner but had a nice menu with salads, vegetarian items (fried green tomato sandwich), burgers, and their signature fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches (the bumblebee was delicious). The price was pretty high but can't complain about anything else. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Hipster divey spot down on Roosevelt. Good vegetarian options but the menu changes so call ahead. The fried green tomato po'boy we had was super tasty. Brussel sprouts were pretty good. There are only 5 or 6 inside seats. Great outdoor patio area, grass, lighted with string lights...gives it charm. It's not the right spot when the weather is iffy...but that's almost never in Phoenix. Smoking can be an issue sometimes."}
{"text":"Man but this place kicks ass.  Incredible, inventive, decadent food.  BITCHING cocktails (try one and you'll see).  Open til 12 on Sunday night.  (Yes!)  Totally savvy musical selections, always. Straight up & personable folks making and serving everything.  The real locals deal.  Feel like I need to go here as much as possible, before it totally blows up and there's no getting a seat.  Big love."}
{"text":"The first time I saw this place, I felt so curious and decided to give it  a try. This place is a labor of love, from the mountains of delicious comfort food to the impressively functional bar squeezed next to the griddle. I love this place and it loves me back. You must check this out!"}
{"text":"Remember to suck in your gut when entering and exiting this place. It doesn't bode the largest establishment around, and if you show up at the wrong time you might be sitting outside in the sun in anticipation.   I have been to this place several times and have not been disappointed once. I would suggest something for you to try, but I can't decide on any specific thing that is better than the other. The cup of sweet toast is a must try. My face literally melted off in delight. The burgers and fresh-cut fries are in my personal epic category. The egg sandwich is ridiculous. Really the only knock to this place is it's size. If I didn't need a crowbar to get myself out of the building each time I go, then it might be better.   Seriously people, go here. Eat here. Revel in your trip to the land of gluttony. I love this little cramped trailer and it's treasure trove of goodness."}
{"text":"Wish I could base my rating on more than my short experience there. I went in this afternoon to meet a friend for an early dinner. I had seen a picture on IG and the food looks delicious plus I love supporting local businesses, so i was excited to try it.  I went inside and there was 1 table available so I asked the girl cleaning the table If I can seat myself or if they seat the guests, she asked if it was just me & I let her know I was meeting someone.  She said she couldn't give me a table until the whole party was there so I'd have to wait outside -- TOTALLY understandable. No problem with not being able to give me a table. So I said, \"oh okay. Is it okay if I wait here?\" -- I was standing by the door/server station.  She replied, \"sorry, you're going to have to wait outside\"   Ummmm okay....? It was 104 outside. Sooo I went outside and saw my friend across the street & decided to just eat at Cafe Gallo instead since I really didn't like that interaction at all. I don't have anything to say about the food because the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Good late-night spot in a residential neighborhood. Came here after the Suns v Warriors game and had ourselves the poutine fries, Mac and cheese with chorizo and I got the Big Jim and my gf got the Bumblebee. The poutine fries were decent. We both loved the Mac and cheese with chorizo! You can usually add any toppings you want to the Mac and cheese. My gf didn't like her bumblebee. She said there was too much seeded mustard and too much honey. But she did say the chicken was moist and tender. My big Jim was pretty good although I wish it had more gravy. Gravy was delicious, chicken was tender but overall I felt it was a little too \"dry\". But then again I like sauces with my food and in this case if I'm getting gravy, the more the better. Some might disagree and say too much takes away from the flavor of other ingredients. True. But IMO I wish it had more gravy. Without it, the biscuit was good but a little dry. Overall, food, service and ambience was good. Cool, hip place. Would definitely come back for Mac and cheese and maybe try a different biscuit \"sandwich\""}
{"text":"Nestled in a residential area, you will find the \"Welcome Diner\"not only do they welcome guests, They are all super friendly and passionate about what they do! The food is incredible, especially the fried green tomatoes ! Can't wait to visit downtown Phoenix again and the Welcome Diner!"}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy is my favorite. It's so good I could cry."}
{"text":"Although a little pricier than I'd prefer, I'm giving Welcome Diner 5 stars for the delicious locally-produced food, relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and the outgoing people who work there. You know a restaurant has something good going when a college student is willing to pay $10 for a watermelon salad. Or $5 for french fries with an egg on top (seriously, you have to try it. So delicious.) Welcome Diner has a unique operation--in the warm Arizona months, Welcome Diner operates from 5pm to midnight, and during the cool Arizona months, it's open for brunch and lunch. Whenever you happen to visit, you'll be greeted warmly, offered delicious food, and given a wonderful starry opportunity to enjoy the night (or morning) with dear friends."}
{"text":"How cool is this place? It's definitely in a 'transitional' area of town, but the clientele when we were there was fully gentrified: skinny jeans, back tattoos, and beards all around. We didn't get any food, but the drink menu is awesome and seriously affordable ($6 for specialty cocktails?!). I love how you order at the window and they bring your order out to you. I'm all for a good-tasting drink over a booze-y one, but these actually seemed to venture to the weak side - FYI."}
{"text":"Writing this while we're still at Welcome Diner, because it is THAT good. We're traveling through Phoenix and found this place just a few miles from our Airbnb. After a long day of traveling, this place was everything. We loved the community feel, the twinkly lights, and the locally sourced ingredients. We split two burgers--the Welcome burger and the Blue Sky burger. Both were delicious and came with a side (we tried the cole slaw and the side salad). They have a cool retro bar and solid beer list, but we opted for the homemade fruit punch (which was so good). I wish we were in Phoenix longer so we could come back again!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it did not disappoint. Amazing burgers...   The PB&B (peanut butter) was insane. The special was the champion burger with caramelized onions and it was great too, but I would definitely go with the peanut butter one again..and again.   Also had a a homemade biscuit with honey and it was crazy good. Prob try a fried chicken biscuit sandwich next time.   Place has a lot of character. Old RV converted into a restaurant. Minimal indoor seating but not a bid deal. Wish I lived closer... Great place."}
{"text":"This place was the only Thing within walking distance of where we stayed. It is mostly outdoor seating and the menu is pretty limited. The $4 whiskey sours were pretty good. The sandwiches were original. Fried green tomato for instance but they were 9-$10 and not all that filling.  The pulled pork fries fro $8 was a large portion but my girlfriend and I had indigestion all night, something that hasn't happened since I was a kid...just too much fat."}
{"text":"Tucked away into an old central (and scary) neighbourhood, it was a bit hard  to find in the dark. Glad we did, though! Got a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched.  We sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity.  An order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21."}
{"text":"This is my favorite eatery! End of the review.  Ok starting with the food: The salads are awesome, although a bit pricey but the owners explained that they grow most everything themselves or source it from small organic farms. They are worth every penny.  The sandwiches are some of the best I ever had. Jambalaya is amazing. The list goes on and on.  I've been here a couple dozen times and never had a bad experience. Yes this place gets busy at times but for a reason.  The happy hour drinks are a great deal too. Only the best ingredients for a more than fair price. Same for the food.  It's always a homey and welcoming and there are some great and very passionate and authentic people working here which truly reflects in the food.  If you haven't done so please come here and check it out. By now they have legendary status in the area already anyways.  Thanks for all the good moments I had there."}
{"text":"The BFD isn't Payton Curry. its not the food, either, its the floorshow. Payton and his wife manage to make this tiny space feel cavernous and fabulous. Their banter is hysterical, and Payton somehow manages to hear everything said on the floor from his outpost cooking. The words fly fast, but you'll laugh hysterically.    And the food? Inventive, fresh, reasonable and fast."}
{"text":"OMG. A must visit when in Phoenix !!! Maybe it is just because I love real food and of course real drink. So my second visit to the Welcome Diner was much delayed with conflicting travel schedules that did not bring me here in time for a masterful dinner sooner. My loss... Check out the pics this time around. Biscuits Gravy - Fried chicken - Yes FRIED EGGS (2)- Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and of course red slaw. Well cardiologists you must be jealous. Drink order:   \"Black Cat\" = Bourbon rocks +  splash of Absinthe. Drink of the Kentucky Gods.     Only request would be that they stock some Old Smokey Shine in a Mason Jar of course."}
{"text":"Thank you again fellow Yelpers!  I tried this place based on your reviews and I am happy that I did!  Tonight I had the PB&B burger.  Crunchy peanut butter, B&B pickles, bacon and cheddar.  I selected fries over coleslaw.  I also upgraded for $3 to Poutine fries.  Add on tasty beignets dusted in local honey and powdered sugar for desert.  What are Poutine fries you ask?  They are the staple food in the Toronto area.  French fries smothered in country gravy and melted cheese.    A little to crazy for your taste buds?  No worries.  They have normal food too.  Welcomediner.net"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for a casual hang out. There usually is a line, but it's always a pleasant wait. You order at the counter and find a seat. There is counter seating inside, but not much. I've ordered mixed drinks inside. Not sure if they are available on the outside deck/yard area. Check their Instagram to keep up with whatever new creations they have to munch on."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place?! Try the ginger beer. I wish they would bottle that stuff so I can start hoarding it."}
{"text":"The most incredible place to take someone who is visiting. The food never disappoints and service is generally perfect. Never a bad experience here, but it can be pretty packed at times!"}
{"text":"While driving around town my friend and I came across the welcome diner. I've seen it before during an art festival but never had the chance to eat there. Remember that day I told my friend we should try it. When we arrived to the window where you order food the customer service was horrible and very unfriendly. The guy that was taking our order was just rude and not happy at all. It seem like he was upset about something and was taking it on us. It was our first time being there and I would of thought that the guy would of mention the daily special or even recommend he's favorite dish but instead was so commanding and rude. To make matters worse; we did not get our food until an hour later. The burger was dry and not tasty. There was no love to the burger. I don't think I'll go back or recommend this place to my friends or family."}
{"text":"Fun and delicious dinner spot. Get the home made ginger beer. Good for vegetarians. Great atmosphere and friendly people."}
{"text":"I feel I am an expert on fried chicken, and I had the Big Jim today with a side of eggs.  Fresh squeezed oj and LUX coffee.  The biscuit was unbelievable and sliced in half and put on the grill for an extra crisp; the fried chicken breast on the sandwich ... well, watch out LOLO and Mrs. White and f**k Chick Fil-A and the Hate Chicken, I will never EVER miss that again, knowing this place exists.  I can't describe the extra crispy not at all greasy breast - and the bacon and cheese and gravy was amazzzzzing.  Hipster waitress and they kept coming around to refill my coffee on a lovely chilly sunday morning at 1030.   I'll be back, but my waistline will suffer.  GO, puts MATT's big breakfast to shame.    My minus one star- Needs a booster or something for small kids to sit in."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on Friday evening. Their happy hour ran from 5pm (when they open) until 7pm. They have a good mix of drink deals (like $1 off draft beer and $6 cocktails) and food specials. I had the little birdie and the pork fries. The little birdie sandwich was very good, but I wish the batter in the fried chicken had a little more seasoning to it. The biscuit was great though,  nice and soft. The pork fries were great, the cabbage slaw on top of them was just the right topping. Overall, this place is definitely worth checking out. It has a great trendy atmosphere and their menu items are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fun, hippy, eclectic yet completely off the charts kind of place. Been coming here for three years now and the menu items are all to die for. This time I got me an old fashioned, and that drink is very well made here. For my dinner I got the mac and cheese, one of my favorite dishes here. Very creamy, cheesy dish that makes you want more. I also ordered a side of hand cut fries and those were amazing as well. Definitely recommend this place and I'll come back again. Have low expectation for seating and be open minded, you'll have fun.  Another update.... The new location is amazing. They moved and have a larger indoor seating area and even larger outdoor area. Food was still amazing, I got the grilled cheese and it just was AMAZING."}
{"text":"They source local food and try to find non-GMO the people that work here are also really cool beans; as is the crowd usually.  This place has a bit of a laid-back hipster vibe if you."}
{"text":"I had the Mac and cheese. Very good choice. They torch the top so it has a crust. The wife orders the PBB which is a hamburger with peanut butter and pickles on it. Sounds weird but was very good. She also poutine which was very delicious. We topped it off with beignets. All after midnight. Fantastic! The only thing that was disappointing was the decal in the restroom degrading my president. I won't be able to support them anymore."}
{"text":"Came here for an interview.  First time in Phoenix.   Nice outdoor scenery setting.  I often like this as indoor restaurants can sometime be stifling.     However, food was just ok.  Tried the fries.  Too salty.  Too fatty feeling.  Portion for fries was huge, but you pay for it...would not get it again.  Was not able to finish.    Burger was also just ok.  Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying from the time I pulled up to the place, walked in the courtyard, stepped into the diner and took a seat on one of the 9 stools at the corner of the counter, I was a fan.  This tiny place packs a big punch.  The employees are super friendly and upbeat. There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.   It's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good. There are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.   I like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.   I will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.  I have got to try that for myself.  So my recommendation to you is to go, eat, experience this little diner for yourselves.  There is soul in the food they serve.   Here is a link to the diner's website:  http://www.marthaandmary.net/welcomediner/welcome.html"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed!! Me and my two girlfriends came by here for a late night dinner and we were blown away! What amazing hospitality and food! The pineapple beer is flawless and the fried green tomato sandwich was to die for. Thank you for taking care of us so well, can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The next Nobuo Fukuda event will be at Restaurant Noca on 8/27. Warning -- link to PDF.  http://www.restaurantnoca.com/Menu/Specials/NOCA_Nobuo_August_Menu.pdf"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Hidden in a neighborhood, we would have never found it without our friends recommendation. We had the Peanut butter and bacon burger. It was delish! My husband also had the ginger beer, was very gingerly. The location was really cool. Outside seating mainly. I was in awe. Food was great. Somehow I felt it would have been even better with milk shakes on their menu. We will be back! Give it a try! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing every time I've been here. First time I went with a Clever Koi cook and he knew the people that worked there so we got free samples. Can't really go wrong with anything but the fried green tomato sandwich with bacon is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall (hole in the trailer?) restaurant. Great relaxed vibe, with good old bluesy southern music as a backdrop to the even better tunes of familiar conversation. I loved how hometown it felt. This is definitely a place where strangers become friends.  Fantastic service! Our server was Brandon, who was so helpful in making sure my meal was vegan and describing every delicious detail to us. Upon leaving, every employee waved and thanked us for dining. So nice!  On to the food...fantastic. I had a veggie burger with fried avocado on the side. Life changing. My boyfriend had the classic burger and fries, and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the vegan po'boy.  I'm really excited to be a frequent patron of the Welcome Diner. So happy we found it!"}
{"text":"Welcome diner has been on my bookmarks for a long time. After such long anticipation and procrastination my boyfriend and I went to grab a bite. Unfortunately i wish I would have waited ... I am the type of person that sees Mac and Cheese and I MUST order. I ordered the M&C ($8) and additionally added tomatoes and jalapeno ($2). My boyfriend ordered the Big Jim and the fries and gravy. I tried everything we that my bf and I ordered and nothing blew me away. The m&c was just okay, possibly not worth the $2 extra dollars i paid to ad so little vegetables. The big Jim was not the best, maybe a factor to that was that my bf ordered the patty medium well and it was not to my tasting. The fries and gravy were not bad, but i would not reorder.  The ambiance is very relax but very crowded. I was with a group of 5 and we had difficulty finding where to sit, so if you would like to dine there keep your eyes peeled for a good table. Also keep in mind I went on a Saturday night , so it may be busier compared to weekdays."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I haven't had the chance to actually distill on the crowds of Phoenix and beyond how wonderful this place is.  The menu depending on how hungry you are is accommodating to any appetite whether you're just looking to munch or full out grub.  If you can beat the 2AM cutoff the drinks here are prepared with care, precision and outright thought to the discerning palate.  In this day and age just utilize your smartphone to find this place or jump on a bike from the many rent a bikes in the DT PHX area to get here on a pub crawl or meander on through the colorful and eclectic neighborhood.  If you have a chance to sit inside and chat up the staff they are welcoming as the name implies, humorous and always accommodating!!!  A go to spot for me for sure!"}
{"text":"Bienvenidos! Always wanting to try new places, my brother and I came here for dinner one evening for their happy hour. It was too humid outside so we snagged two seats at the bar inside. It's a small trailer-like spot with a bathroom reminiscent of one in an airplane. It was cooler inside but a bit cramped of course, and I didn't appreciate being around alcohol and the smell but it was worth it being indoors.  We ordered the jackfruit fries from their HH menu to start and I got the Bumblebee biscuit. My brother got the Koko biscuit, which he enjoyed. I thought the fries were great, shoestring topped with purple slaw and jackfruit, such an interesting and tasty food. I loved my biscuit, the fried chicken was done right and the sweet and savory flavors of honey and mustard worked really well. Topped with pickles for a nice crunch and change of texture.   There are several vegan options as noted by the V on the menu. Definitely a great spot for dinner and open late."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped here for a late dinner on a Friday night. This place is right in the middle of a downtown Phoenix residential neighborhood and it doesn't look like much from the outside. There are several communal tables outside as well as 8 or 9 stools in a very small area inside. We found a spot at one of the tables and started chatting with our table mates.  The menu is small but has lots of foodie offerings. Our group had: the PB&B, the fried green tomato sandwich, biscuits and gravy and poutine. Everything was fantastic, although the poutine is untraditional. The gravy on my biscuits and gravy had some of the best, yummy, flavorful, salty gravy I've had. And the biscuit was cut in half and grilled so it was a bit crispy. The tap beer list is also pretty impressive considering the building is pretty much a trailer!   It was a great atmosphere with legit eats!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! It's a laid back, casual, hole in the wall, neighborhood gem.  LOVE that there is this historic looking little diner in the middle of what appears to be a residential area.  Reminds me of the historic district back home.   I picked my husband up from the airport at 11pm and thought, \"Hey...why not?! Let's try it!\".  I'm SO glad we did.    It was PACKED.  I asked if they were always that busy and he said \"Yep.  Often busier.  We use fresh ingredients and make good food.  It makes a big difference.\"   I felt like a newbie ordering, asking for a receipt, etc. (because they were so busy), but they were as patient as they could be.  My husband and I both ordered biscuits and gravy to go.  He ordered his with two over-medium fried eggs and I ordered mine with a side of brussel sprouts.   While we were waiting, he had a soda and I had the Ginger Beer.  The Ginger Beer was knock your socks off spicy, but I'm sure it's what saved me from a night full of tummy troubles (eating rich biscuits and gravy right before bed is probably not a good idea).  It was definitely homemade and packed a TON of ginger punch. It will make your throat burn in a good way.  The food was outstanding.  The biscuits were sliced in half, toasted, and accompanied by the super thick, rich sausage gravy.  For us, the gravy had a bit too much heat (excessive black pepper, perhaps cayenne...not sure), but...it was still VERY tasty and we both ate every bit. His eggs were perfect and my sprouts were fantastic with just the right amount of caramelization and oil/butter.   We will definitely be back and often.  :)"}
{"text":"The outdoor scenery is very elegant. the food was really enjoyable and pleasant. I really enjoy the fun feeling it has to it. very classy to go to and have a great dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Vegan Po'Boy. Oh my gosh!  Fried avocado! Everything here is a yes! My mom still talks about this place years later!"}
{"text":"My family and I were drawn to this place because of the great reviews and how close it was to the game we just watched & open late. We got there around 9:45 ordered the Poutine fries w/ gravy on the side, Mac and cheese, the carol, big Jim, and the welcome burger.   The seating was spread out and basically just a hangout spot for a bunch of hipsters. We didn't know if they were doing orders in order or just unorganized because we literally waited an hour before we asked when our order was going to be done. No one even asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything during our waiting time. I'm all about customer service and the lack of it turned all of us off.  We got our food at 10:50, probably because we didn't look happy when we asked when our food would be done. The dishes were good but not worth the hour wait, mind you today is just a Wednesday. We will not be back.  What made us even more upset is the fact that one of the employees brought out the couples food next to us, within 20/30 mins of them being there AND gave them free drinks. Maybe it's because we're Asian and we were the minority at the diner."}
{"text":"Let's just say that if this place had a basement I'd live there. the food is amazing and the service is friendly and prompt. it has a well established reputation of excellence. Thanks Yelp for this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Decided to walk over to Welcome Diner from Chase field after a Diamondbacks game last night.  I personally would not recommend that walk late at night, but my fiancée and I made it just fine. No frills and kind of odd is the way I would describe this place. I got the Big Jim and it was legit. Pair that with my favorite beer from the brewery I used to live next to in Tucson (Dragoon)? Win win and win. Anyway back to the Big Jim, it was really good, especially considering my sobriety level, the gravy and chicken was just what I needed to carry on last night. The wife to be got herself a Bumble Bee which she deemed quite delicious. You'll have to take her word on that, as I was not able to procure any samples for my taste laboratory. It's a really strange place in the middle of a neighborhood, in the middle of Phoenix. Some people will really love this place and some won't get it."}
{"text":"Fun and delicious! The car shows they have there too are a great way to fill up and have some quality time w/ loved ones."}
{"text":"One of the best spots to go after a night of dancing/drinking. Food is good! I've had a few burgers and they all were awesome, even the peanut butter pickle burger lol. Wanna come back to try their drinks."}
{"text":"REVIEWER #667th:   Well first of all I want to start this review off by saying that I'm honored to be The one to move us past the 666th review. I would like to thank all my in-laws for bringing me to the welcome dinner to make this all possible.  This place is actually pretty nice and the food is actually pretty good. I'll be honest I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Their homemade ginger beer is a must. I pretty much ordered half the menu all the items on the menu were super solid:  Luxardo Salad 5/5: They did a great job on this one the go cheese was not overwhelming and it was balanced out by the apples they offer a dressing on the side which there really was no need for and I never used.  Jumbayala 5/5: probably the best jambalaya I have ever had. My only qualm about this one is I asked if it was spicy he said no. I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spicy food and it was in my opinion decently spicy. But the texture was amazing perfect balance of chicken.  BIG JIM 5/5: The key to this being so good is 100% the biscuit. The biscuit is moist and a perfect complement to the gravy and chicken. The portion is definitely enough to fill a person.   Beignets 4/5: The beignets  are pretty good but they are pretty deep fried as well. I like my Beignets  a little bit softer on the inside.   Goat cheese and preserves 2/5: this was probably the only downside to my meal. I think they should've made the preserves a little bit sweeter as it is a dessert. The goat cheese overwhelmed the taste and made it kind of sour.     Summary: we went there around 10 PM, outside seating was nice nice ambience to the place the table we sat at had not been cleared and we had to go ask somebody to clear it, or we could've played it ourselves but they didn't have a place for that. There was a drunk lady that was smoking next to us that I had to ask her to put our cigarette, but she was fairly kind about it. But then 20 minutes later another guy lit one up a feet away from us.   The smoking is the primary reason I gave it 4/5 stars. I would've liked to of seen management be a little bit stricter on that. Nobody wants to breathe in your nasty smoke when they're trying to enjoy a meal with their family. They do have bicycle parking, and you can rent some on the street as well. They're open late which is nice as well. Overall I really enjoyed it and would go back! :)"}
{"text":"This was an excellent adventure. The service is super friendly and the food is unique and deserves more praise. I ordered the fried chicken biscuit with gravy and cheese and bacon. That was the best choice of all the meals I tried and will be what I order when I return. We started with pulled pork fries that were BBQ flavored with a mustard twist. It was bold but I would try something else next time. The burgers were great and the fries were too. Great late night food, I would suggest this to my yelper friends."}
{"text":"GRREAT place!  The burgers and fries are great (although as previously stated the burgers are a little small but the quality makes up for it) ... (I've posted a picture)  **** note they don't take credit/debit cards ****  The neighborhood isn't the greatest but no biggie.  I have to say best part was the service!  After ordering and telling them I'd eat outside they asked if I had a dog, I said yes, and he said \"I'll get you a bowl of water before anything else.\"  SOOOOOO cool!  They CLEARLY take GREAT care an food prep ... they wear latex gloves and unlike other like places .... when dealing with the money part they take off the gloves!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocked. We were a little hesitant at first to try it bit it worked out. The location is right smack dab in the middle of a residential area and the diner literally sticks out of a house or possibly used to be a house but the food was phenomenal. All the seating is outdoor with a walk up window to order. The staff and the food choices definitely had a little hipster vibe. The collard greens were freaking amazing and the rest of the food was up to par for sure. Only complaint probably is that the drinks were a bit on the pricy side, $3.50 for a tall can of Pabsts. All in all, I would definitely visit again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff. Only one time did I go where I wasn't impressed. Top of biscuit burnt and chicken dry. Other than that food and service has been superb. Great comfort food and a nod to the south with the fried green tomato sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Finally! A brand new Welcome Diner location where you can actually sit inside during the blistering Phoenix heat!   Okay. Well, that's not necessarily true.  My girlfriend and I stopped by after they had been open for about four days and were disappointed to find ourselves relegated to the patio. Of course, it was prime dining hours, so you can't really knock them for being popular, now can you?  What I've always liked about \"Welcome\" is the simplicity of their menu. The options are not overwhelming, the quality is extremely high, and the food is sourced from all the right places. While not everything I've had here is perfect, it's very difficult to go wrong with most of their options.  Once I point out a handful of hipster clichés to my girlfriend, I always feel a little more at ease once I see that we're not the only people in their thirties dining here. Everyone can come here - even if you don't own a fedora or have facial hair! It's true!  As for the food, classic staples are still present, such as my all-time favorite grilled cheese sandwich in all of its smokiness. The spectacular chicken biscuit sandwiches, burgers that put most places to shame, and those damned poutine fries that everyone seems to crave.  Desserts are tough. You might find yourself thrilled with something, but might end up damning other customers to hell for depleting their inventory of something you were hoping to try.   Anyway, I still give Welcome Diner high praise, but will probably give it a more in-depth review when I can actually sit inside and not have to eat my bowl of grits while simultaneously shooing away flies.  Until then, go visit them, but please don't eat all of the pies!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, unique setting, and completely chill staff. I had the fried green tomato po'boy. It was so tasty and the tomato had an excellent crunch. My husband had a chicken biscuit which he loved. We split the mac and cheese.The mac and cheese is in my top 5 for Phoenix.  The outside seating area is a great place to relax and eat delicious grub. My only complaint is there was an excessive amount of aggressive flies. Probably something they can't help but it was still annoying.   I can't wait to go back and sample more delicious comfort food!"}
{"text":"These guys definitely colored outside the line on this place. You order at a walk up window and find somewhere to sit. Seating is open and you'll like be sharing you table with strangers. Which is cool. You get to meet new folks and swap foodie stories if you're lucky.  The food here is terrific. I had the grilled cheese sandwich. This was really good. It wasn't an over the top massive gob of gooey cheese. This sandwich was a savory treat on rustic sourdough bread. Very well prepared. My wife had the Koko. A biscuit sandwich with fried chicken breast & arugula topped with a creamy sauce with a little snap. We got a side of Bignets and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts. Both worth the price of admission.  If you like a good Bloody Mary, you have to try the WD version.  This place rocks. Once again, my fellow yelpers were spot on."}
{"text":"Definitely off the beaten path! Loved the big joe so much I had to try the carol. Then the no way Jose burger, then the grilled cheese and fried green tomato sandwich! Loved everything but the AZ heat. Go inside! ALL the staff is friendly. A must visit in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  My favorite dish is the Bumble bee, delicious fried chicken on a biscuit with honey and honey mustard.  I dream about that chicken.  The location is quirky, in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Almost entirely outdoor seating, stand in line to order at the window and then find a seat.  Expect a decent wait both to order and to get food (approx 30 min each).  Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My fiancé came here for a late anniversary dinner around midnight. I ordered a special burger they had called the Jose I believe and my fiancé ordered the Carol. We both absolutely LOVED our food. The burger I ordered had a jalapeno relish with onions and it was just amazing. The Carol was also really delicious and unlike any other pulled pork sandwich we had ever eaten. The staff was very friendly and it was lit cutely with string lights. We are so happy to have a late night spot to dine in Phoenix that's not a fast food restaurant. I absolutely love this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS. The food did take a little while but the quality of the food and the taste of the food made up for the wait. I had the Pb&B burger... it was heaven inside of a bun, it had peanut butter on it with pickles, this would normally be an odd combination but the sweetness of the pickles and the salt from the peanut butter made for a great duo. The atmosphere was very lively and happy. The service was good but when you order there is a small window that you order through and the woman/man who takes your order sticks you drink through this tiny window. This is a great Establishment and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The new location is so much better. The counter seats kept the diner feel but much more space. The food was on point. The patio is still the best seat in the Garfield area. Definitely stop in if you are downtown.  Hidden Gem!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Great experience! I am new to AZ, so I am enjoying trying new places. Welcome diner is all around awesome.  I would like to see more vegetarian options, but aside from that, everything was amazing. We chose to eat inside the diner at the counter, good call on our part. The staff served up great service, delicious food, with a side dish of humor to make the evening even more fun. Looking forward to my next visit and bringing friends to experience this fabulous establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken and donuts are awesome!!! love all of their sauces. The only negative is the place is so small, every time I visit them my clothes get stinky.!"}
{"text":"Super hip outdoor eatery. Headed down at 12:30 to try their food. Had people coming and going the whole time with a great patio area and lots of seating    We ordered the Big Jim with an egg, the PB&BB, poutine and mac and cheese with bacon.  They have great sausage gravy.  The mac and cheese was amazing and portion was very large as was all the food.   Great friendly staff and a wonderful experience. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Old Diner turned modern with a retro vibe! Super super super nice employees. Everyone was so helpful, friendly, sweet and passionate about this place and their jobs here. It's not just a job it's a community of people. I felt like I was picnicking in the south on a hot summer night in downtown Phoenix! Farm to table delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"Tried Welcome Diner for the first time tonight.  We did only try the Hurricanes but will definitely be back to try the biscuits. The place is very unique.  We sat outside and it was kind of like sitting in someone's backyard.  They have a walk up window if you chose to sit outside or you can sit inside at the small counter. It was happy hour all day since it was Tuesday.  Awesome!! Service as polite and quick. The Hurricanes were refreshing but not strong. Don't let the neighborhood or decor scared tour away. Can't wait to come back and try the food and other cocktails."}
{"text":"Cute little diner right in the middle of the neighborhood. Stopped here real quick before taking my sister to the airport. We each had a biscuit sandwich: she had the chicken and biscuit with bacon, cheese, and gravy and it was great and I had the one with chicken, honey, mustard, and pickles and it was excellent.  2 sandwiches and a coke to split was $21."}
{"text":"All you need to know about coming here: GET THE BEIGNET This is such a great casual place to go for dinner! The atmosphere is nice because it feels super casual, yet at the same time can be romantic (just depends on who you go with I suppose). All the workers are so kind here and the comfort-style-food they sell is so seriously bomb! Parking can be a pain, and yes you'll probably have to wait a good half hour to an hour to eat, but it will all be worth it because you have to wait to get a good seat anyway."}
{"text":"My fish po'boy ain't so bad. My husband's PB&B was worthy of a recounting of the crunchy peanut butter anytime someone says something related to burgers. The poutine was tasty. But the one item that made us say \"We must come back.\" was the mac and cheese. Not greasy, not disgustingly cheesy (he loves cheese. He likes to quote a commercial routinely: Great love needs more cheese.), and perfectly done.   I enjoyed sitting outside in this fairly quiet neighborhood at 8 on a Saturday evening. The employees were friendly and engaged in our playful banter. One very kindly spent way too long trying to light a heating lamp for us until we all agreed it must be broken. Warning: their bathroom is a tiny little square with a folding door directly next to the kitchen. Hold your pee until the next location, ladies who are wearing tights under your dresses/skirts."}
{"text":"The only place in town I can be sure to have a good time. My visiting friends loved it. Every portion is right and tastes consistently hearty and like a happy person cooked it. I love the way they do barbecue, meat or vegan, and even basic things like french fries are special when they make them. You can see the happy people that make your food from quality stuff when you get there, since they're pretty visible."}
{"text":"LOVE WELCOME DINER. Their food is absolutely amazing. The service is wonderful. I have been there multiple times and have never once had a bad experience. I tell all my friends about it and love to take people there. You truly cannot get better biscuits. Welcome Diner cannot disappoint."}
{"text":"A colleague highly recommended this place. Its a gem of a place. There is a full bar along with the menu. I tried the fish po boy and let me tell you it was very good. The fish was not breaded but grilled and cole slaw was added to it. This place is open till 2am. You need to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had an amazing fried green tomato sandwich along with hand cut fries. My bestie got the Bumblebee Biscuit-- a sandwich that consisted of fried chicken, honey, mustard and pickles. Seriously cannot wait to get back here!   Also, the service was top notch!   I highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun atmosphere, amazing food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Hipster place trying to appeal to people that have no children and plenty of time. They took way too long to make a grilled cheese sandwich.  We ordered at 10:10 pm according to my receipt, and the food finally arrived at 11:10pm, 1 hour later.  Very disappointing to see all the customers that were in line after myself getting their orders ahead of us.  Our friends were finishing their plates when my order finally arrived, small, burnt and nuclear hot on the inside.  What really capped the disappointment was when the waiter came by to ask how all the food was tasting and I told him I don't know because we have no food to taste, it had been 50 minutes on a 30 min promise and our food still was not here.  He asked what our name was and went back to check, then came back and said they have started working on it now, to which I replied, \"What were they doing for the last 45 minutes if not making our order?\" to which he had no reply.  The Welcome burger looked big and nice and I was really excited to see what I was going to get for a grilled cheese with 3 different cheeses.  When it finally did arrive, it was burnt on the outside and cool to the touch, but Scorching hot on the inside.  They must have used a microwave to re-heat the sandwich, because I can still feel the burn on my mouth the next day.  Not only was the grilled cheese hot, it was also extremely small.  I was thinking something substantial after seeing the mac and cheese on the \"Snack\" menu the size of a small child's head, but the grilled cheese sandwich was more like an appetizer for one, not an entree.  If only I could give them 1/2 a star for the unlimited cold ice water, and the outdoor patio dining room, which were the only good things about the restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG this spot was the best! My bf and I went and got chicken biscuits, I can't remember the name of the sandwiches but they were fire!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant.  Found this on yelp after a concert down town and I'm not sure what I enjoyed more, John mayor or the biscuits and gravy.  Do yourself a favor and grab a group of friends, some drinks, and amazing food."}
{"text":"Welcome Diner is dead. The new location has lost all of the charm and ambiance that drew people to eat there in the first place. I feel like they should have named it Millennial in a Quarter Life Crisis Diner because this restaurant is having an identity crisis. It seems like the interior decor was designed by a 55 year old who looked at a Buzzfeed list of things millennials like and then just crammed all of them into the building without taking into account that they don't all go together. In the diner there is old milk cartons turned into seats, disco balls, pinatas, plants in hanging macrame holders, and your receipt comes in an old book. And yes while all those things can be neat when used well, that is not the case here. Additionally, I feel the food quality has gone down. The portions seemed smaller and the quality of the meat just wasn't there. Previously, you could taste the high quality meat in the burger. Not anymore. The patio was fine. However, the lightning could be improved. It was too harsh. All in all this now feels like a restaurant you would find in Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with some buddies of mine. The menu is pretty small but Its something you kind of deal with. It'd be nice if they expanded menu options but I still come back because it's a nice little hang out spot when you just want some fresh air.. somewhere to just sit, relax, and chat in a nice setting with a friend. Love the vibe that's set here. Whether it's the restaurant it's self, or the variety of different ppl that enjoy this establishment it's definitely so intriguing. I still want to give this place 5 stars because the food is still very flavor filled and the staff is SO SO nice. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of (finally) eating at Welcome Diner today and it was amazing! I can't wait to go back.   I had the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a side of fried avocado, both of which were great. Fried chicken was juicy and biscuit was flaky and tasted fresh. The fried avocado was awesome and like nothing I have had before.   My friend got a collard green sandwich with a fried egg on top. She smashed it and then raved about how great it was. Each sandwich came with a side of fruit which was the perfect side for the heavy sandwiches.   Like I said before I can't wait to go back!! Highly recommend, this is a local gem that I would love to see thrive."}
{"text":"What a fun concept for late-night fare in Phoenix!   Dude and I popped into Welcome Diner after an evening at The Nash, and it didn't disappoint.   You'll walk through a quiet neighborhood, and bam! There's the small, ecclectic trailer.   You can certainly sit inside; however, it gets packed at the bar - Walk up to the window, order and pay, then sidle up to one of the picnic tables and wait.   Our first trip in, we ordered   1) The Koko Sandwich 2) Poutine  3) Can of Biltmore Blonde for me ;)   The Koko was the highlight of the night.   Think a baseball sized biscuit and a larger-than-your-fist sized piece of juicy, delicious fried chicken. I'm not sure what all is in the batter. It was crispy and delicious, but there was also a very creamy element to it. Perhaps buttermilk? Who knows.   Dressed with arugula and a thick tomato slice, and some of the most delicious chipotle ranch!   No problem splitting this between two people, but next time I ain't sharin', sorry Dude It was that good.  We also got an order of the poutine, which wasn't anything remarkable. The gravy seemed bland and uninspired (minus the ridiculous amount of saltiness, even for poutine) and the bacon and curds weren't that memorable.    Gone are the days of IHOP and Waffle House, Welcome Diner is THE place for late night fare in Phoenix.   I can't wait to come back and enjoy that PB&J Burger with a cocktail."}
{"text":"OMG best biscuit sandwich I've ever had!!! You don't need anything to go with this sandwich!! I had to take a piece of pie to go I was so stuffed!! Great ambiance & met some great people while I was there!! The staff was awesome & there's seating outside & limited seating inside. I was able to grab a stool inside!! When I come back to Phoenix this will be my first stop!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I just wish it was closer to this Tempe resident.  We both had a WHISKEY SOUR!!!!  We are not cocktail folks but we LOVED it!!  When ordering a second round, I innocently asked for an extra cherry.  For $1 you can get an extra cherry.  I'm new to the world of cocktail cherries, but these apparently are very special Luxarno cherries!  AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!  The people here are so nice.  Food was good - he had burger, I had chicken on a biscuit (chicken a little too thick) but so good.  Just wish we were closer. Love love love!"}
{"text":"We went to Welcome Diner for Easter brunch and it was remarkable...   There are two things in that sentence for which I am grateful.   Thing 1: Thank you WD for being open on Easter. I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment.   Thing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.  This was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not.   The Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way.   I think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away.   The only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun.   We sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful. Although as the morning moved along it did get uncomfortable at times when the sun would be at just the right angle to blast you for just long enough you could feel the sunburn happening.   All that said, get there while the weather is good! And if you do get warm, they make some refreshing mixed drinks (I had the Hurricane) and they also have a nice little beer selection as well. I almost forgot about that... I probably need to drink less of them next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such an amazing place. Had a basil gimlet, my god!!! And Will, he and the boys behind the bar are such studs."}
{"text":"The first time we attempted to come here we were unable to eat inside and it was raining so we didn't eat. The second time it was nice enough to sit outside. The server recommended a honey chicken biscuit sandwich, which I ordered with a side of brussle sprouts. It was pretty good, the honey on it made it messy to eat and the biscuit was a bit much in ration to the chicken. I would probably order something else next time.  My  husband ordered a burger, which he said was good, nothing over the top. I would come back and try something different, their patio is cute and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"The wife and I ate dinner here tonight and we got the veggie sandwich.  It was amazing we were both blown away.  Will you please put this on the menu?"}
{"text":"I had the bumblebee biscuit with the brussel sprouts - both were phenomenal! We placed our order and the waiter told us that everything is made homemade and has won awards. It was hard to choose!   We ended with the begniets which were not great - they were giant and heavy and had a lemon aftertaste that I wasn't a fan of."}
{"text":"I have only been a few times but each time has been really delicious, the grilled cheese and the little birdie are so good and they have a good selection of beers and cocktails. Most of the seating is outside (there are big heaters for the colder months) with a very few seats inside although I have never eaten inside. Staff is very friendly and has a really great neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"Perfect late night spot. Reminds me of grabbing dinner at a roadside stand in a small town.   Portions are big, food is greasy but fresh, and prices aren't that bad.   I love old valentine diners, and this is a great example. A real gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Visiting Phx from SD. Found this small diner on a yelp search. We are heading to east phx for a concert. Wanted something close by but not too pricey.  Nestled in a historic district surrounded by many original cottage homes this little walk up diner has some tasty eats. My sone went for the pb&b burger peanut butter and bacon. Came with fries. He says 5 stars. My husband got the fish po boy. A big piece of seasoned grilled fish with coleslaw on a bun. Nice and meaty flavorful fish. I got tge fried green tomato sammie with roasted brussel sprouts side. The sandwich was spicey but flavorful. Only miss here were the roasted sprouts. Too much overdark roasted sprouts. The ones not too browned were good in their simplicity. A thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix! I had the whitefish sandwich, my husband had the PBB (burger with peanut butter), my mom had the jambalaya. The white fish was very tasty! The burger was surprisingly good. However, I cannot recommend the jambalaya, was dry, not that good. I'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great late night place, the food, the service and the ambiance is amazing!  We arrived and feel in love with the atmosphere of the Welcome Diner, the lights were twinkling and the music was perfect. We ordered after asking the nice gentlemen taking orders what was good, sat down and enjoyed the ambiance and out food arrives shortly after that.  Bonus: this place is super dog friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I had this place on a list of \"gotta try\" lunch places near my new job. Today was the day to give it a try and I was blown away. The place is super cute (tiny inside and a nice patio), awesome, unique menu, EXTREMELY friendly service and the food was killer. I chose the Bumble Bee, fried chicken breast, local honey, house made beer mustard and bread &  butter pickles on a huge homemade biscuit. How they got the chicken freakishly crunchy yet completely juicy on the inside is a mystery right up there with the Loch Ness Monster and Bermuda Triangle. For a side, I tried the fried avocado. Oh yes, I said it. Again, crispy beyond belief and soft creamy avocado on the inside. There may be voodoo happening in that tiny kitchen. I will be back to investigate further...maybe for brunch!"}
{"text":"This small mom&pop style restaurant has great food and an awesome atmosphere. It's very casual and friendly. It's usually pretty busy and has a small kitchen so you can't be in a huge hurry to leave but as long as you're aware of that, you'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!  What an appropriately named restaurant.  We were warmly welcomed, and then met locals from the colorful house nearby.  They masterfully created an atmosphere of community.  But what's even better is the food.  The biscuits and gravy are a must try.  I didn't even know I liked them until I had them here."}
{"text":"The seating here is mostly outdoors. Be prepared for that. It ends up being preferable though because of the misters and the fact that Phoenix evenings are actually really beautiful, if you're looking. Along with the combination of string lights and decorations, you'll feel happy to be there, experiencing it.   I don't eat meat so I can't attest to their fried chicken (although when I come with friends they always enjoy it), but their fried green tomato sandwich is better than most things in life. And I will happily come back for that over and over. I don't think I'll get tired of it, but if I do, they also have a vegan sandwich with pulled jackfruit that tastes good as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, friendly and cool wait staff. The fried green tomato sandwich was unbelievably awesome. Never had anything like it. Drinks are good and reasonable. They actually make their own tonic for the gin and tonic drink. How cool is that? I will be back to try everything else on their menu as it all looked outstanding when other customers were served. The burger and Mac n cheese combo looked pretty good- will try that next time."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot with awesome food, awesome employees who treat everyone like they're friends. The menu is not of the normal run of the mill type but yet a delicious combination that should be tried. As a local business owner and supporter of independent non-chain places to eat, this is a must try! And don't forget that they serve booze! Try the bloody mary or the hurricane!"}
{"text":"Greasy spoons unite!  Great menu, cool vibe, good service and good beers.  I was amazed at how efficient these guys are - they must lead the restaurant world in ratio of patrons served / grill square footage.    A great spot.  Don't come here on a diet though - my meal soaked through the paper plate and left a visible grease puddle on the counter top.  Psst ... the grit cakes are tasty and absorb the flavors of the meal but they are extremely greasy."}
{"text":"Biscuits,  pbr tall boys, craft beers on draft... need I say more? I always end up here as an attempt to sober up after hitting up the bars off of Roosevelt. Long story short it never happens because they sell beer and I just end up getting extra wasted. But, it's okay! Their food is a great hangover cure, so I just come back the next morning and stuff myself with the best biscuits EVER. Hangover situation averted."}
{"text":"Easily a solid 4.5. I continue to be impressed by Phoenix area venues. There is a level of creativity/uniqueness seen here that seems to be matched. A boxed car diner with outdoor picnic tables sitting in the middle of a residential neighborhood? Sign me up!   Welcome diner is the rare combination of good food, low prices, and perfect portion sizes. The fried green tomato sandwich is a must, while the Mac and cheese is among the best I've had. The torched crust takes the dish to a whole new place. The only knock on my one-man feast was the beignets, which were a little on the dense side(eats more like a cake).    To top it all off, they are open till 2am! Welcome diner, you have made a fan out of me.   Now does one want to sit outside in the Arizona heat? that's a separate issue altogether....."}
{"text":"If you could imagine going over to your friend's place for dinner if your friend is a chef?  That is the Welcome Diner.  Every time I have been there, the place was full of laughter and the smell of great food cooking.  If you sit at the counter, you could smack the chef on the ass.  Order a hurricane, and everyone in the joint yells, \"HURRICANE!\"    It is a great time.  My only complaint?  They aren't open enough hours to totally clog my arteries."}
{"text":"Beignets to die for! We happened onto this place after flying in at 11:00 pm from Philadelphia and what a find. Friendly, chill vibe, authentic diner experience with a twist. The fried green tomato sandwich delicious and tangy-chewy, biscuits with gravy just the right amount of creamy and spicy, comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"This establishment is cute and a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. the food is average but they tend to accommodate vegans which is rare. would be a good place to go after dark for most seating is outside.  they are open late and carry booze and beer, no wine."}
{"text":"Hurricane is  a must and big joe is amazing!! Staff is very pleasant too great ambiance overall"}
{"text":"The closer I move to Welcome, the fatter I'll get. Everything is that good. I reminds me of little food bars in New Orleans' Irish Channel. And save room for a cocktail or punch.   Indoor seating is super limited, so be careful in arizona summers"}
{"text":"Great late night hang! The food is great and it's always a good time. The bartenders are attentive and social! Fun for me"}
{"text":"Went to Welcome Diner for the first time this past Saturday. They had a veggie burger on special that I really wanted to try, but sadly they ran out before we got there. Instead I got the vegan po-boy sandwich with a side of fries (which i'm so happy I chose). It was so yummy, and super filling! The menu has lots of great comfort food items, including some vegetarian/vegan options.   The staff was awesome and super friendly. The place has such a neat vibe as well. There's truly nothing like it!"}
{"text":"Careful, you will find yourself addicted to this place! I can never decide between the Big Jim and the Honey Bee. So I get the Big Jim with a side of honey! TOO GOOD! And they are open until 2! it's well worth the drive :D  Just don't crave it on a Monday ;) because they aren't open. I've also had the mac and cheese, and fries. Thumbs up The burgers are DELICIOUS! Every time I have been they've had some time of chef special, that always sounds so tasty. And a couple times i've been they have had $1 Big PBR's. Nice outdoor seating, atmosphere is pretty chill, along with the people who work there!  It's a must go."}
{"text":"Such a cute and delicious place! Perfect for date night! Great drink list and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"They're back as of today, and they're awesome. I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending, I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening today! Solid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint. They opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of \"disasters\" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour. I had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end). Best burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain. The red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty. Both the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.  They've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.      What are you doing? Yeah.  You. Why are you still reading this? Go get a burger or something from here. Blah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open, sure, whatever, maybe that excuse will fly with your family, but not here mister/missy."}
{"text":"I was brought here by some friends who highly recommended this joint. I always down for a hole in the wall style place and it was nothing but that. Service was great and so was the HURRRRICANNEEs.   The food, is blissful and heavenly. The kind of food I cook at home with fresh produce and meat. It hasn't even been 24hrs and Im dying to go back. Everything is top notch and words can't describe this place; you just have to go!!  Sat down and talked with Michael (owner) about meat smoking, cooking and everything culinary. Great guy who knows his s*(&t. Overall, im very glad we were brought here and will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Very fun and laid back diner vibe. Love the food and can't wait to try out everything on the menu.  Very well made drinks. Good happy hour on food and drinks. Can't wait for the weather to cool down so we can enjoy the cute patio."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for a while and was finally able to make it in.  It was a Saturday night and my friends and I were exploring Roosevelt Row when we decided to look for food. We came in around 1a and although it was closing soon, they took our order and said it would take an hour for the food to come out. We ordered drinks and sat down at one of the tables. There were 4 in my group so seating wasn't a problem. The table we sat at was more of a communal table. If we came earlier, I'm sure there'd be a few different groups sitting at our table. The weather is just cooling down so it was nice to actually sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. We were literally the last ones there as our food arrived. I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and was very happy with my choice. The breading was crispy and the tomato itself kept it's shape. The chipotle ranch sauce complimented the flavors and the sourdough was toasted. I love trying different items so if I'm with a group, I sample a bit of everyone's plate. The poutine fries were very hearty. Even though it was smothered in gravy, the fries were crunchy and not soggy. I was also very impressed by the grilled cheese. On my next trip, this would be what I order."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The best burger I've ever had. Everything thing here is amazing. Super fun ambiance & place to hang out. It has very reasonable prices for the quality you get. The staff are all super nice. You have to come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp for leading me to Welcome Diner! I drove out here after work on a Friday, by myself, and knew as soon as I could see it that this place was a gem. It's tucked in a neighborhood, with a red and white trailer, neon lights, and string lights over wooden tables. It's so perfect that I wish I thought of it myself.   You order at a little window and can see three guys all crammed inside, cooking up amazing food. They had happy hour specials while I was there, and I got a local draft beer that was delicious. After much debate, I settled on the North Carolina pulled pork biscuit and a special side salad with a shallot vinaigrette (although it was hard not to order skinny fries and Brussels too!). I was worried it would be packed, but there were just enough people to comfortably eavesdrop and still have some elbow-room.   The food was amazing. You can tell everything is made in small batches, with love and attention to detail. Someone came out and checked on me while I was eating, offered to grab me another drink, and whisked away my dishes as soon as I was finished. Overall, it was a perfect dining experience, and I only wish I could pick this place up and plant it down on the East Coast!"}
{"text":"So happy we drove far to come here. We wanted someplace new and unique and this place has it all. It's unique, adorable and the food is amazing! The location is what makes this unique. It's a hidden gem. The fries were so good, a heart attack on a plate that's so worth it. I got the sunrise and it was fantastic the flavors went so well together. My husband got the bumble bee and the flavors went well together. The honey was delicious with the fried chicken. Overall I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and the food. Well earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"I looked up a list of the best burgers in Phoenix  before our trip to Arizona and the peanut butter and bacon number at Welcome Diner caught my eye. We managed to make it there after a concert, around 1am on Halloween. They were busy, but we managed to get a seat inside.   The diner is in an actual diner car, so it's tiny with a large, cute patio area. The cooks were churning out orders quickly. My boyfriend ordered a delicious White Russian stout and the blue sky burger, and I got my peanut butter burger with fries. The fries were great, the burgers were flavorful, unique and perfectly cooked. The bartender was great, and we very much enjoyed the experience. Cute, quirky little place. I'd definitely come back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"My fav diner hands down. I just love the hospitality and service. The food is delicious. Every time I have a cheat meal welcome is a must. I recommend this place to everyone. I always bring friends to try it.  Keep it up welcome!"}
{"text":"The Big Jim (apparently their best-selling item) is a deep-fried breaded chicken patty with two biscuits and some other toppings. Along with a small amount of sausage gravy. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's too much bread and not enough flavor. Sausage gravy is tasteless. Only two hot sauces are offered. Tabasco and Crystal. Even with that, food needs more flavor. From what I can gather, very little nuance or spice is used in their food. unfortunately, it's all very pricey for above average diner food.   Very limited beer selection (4 taps - nothing special). More focus on cocktails.  Great space, they're all working very hard, super friendly service.  The bathroom is smaller than an airplane bathroom. You are literally in a mobile home restaurant. Not much they can do about that, but it's very cramped.  Great patio!  3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"A great spot to come to for some late night dining. The food isn't amazing, it's greasy and certainly not healthy, but at 1am who cares. Definately not the cleanest joint in town, but character makes up for it. I reccomend it if you've got no other options."}
{"text":"Food was great.  My wife and I had been wanting to try this place and finally made it there a few days ago.  It is in a bit of an odd location wedged in the middle of a neighborhood run-down old homes.  Great place to check out though when weather is nice as it appeared almost all of the seating was outside.  We split the mac and cheese and a fried chicken sandwich with honey.  Both were great.  I am generally not a huge fan of fried chicken but theirs is legit.  Not to greasy and lots of flavor.  Great biscuit as well.  Also thought the mac and cheese was some of the best mac and cheese we have ever had.  Comparable to what you would get at a fine dining restaurant.  Definitely will be back--want to try some of there other things and drinks next time.  Very hipster feel."}
{"text":"Cheerful and relaxed ambience, great food, wonderful and friendly service. Backyard neighborhood party feel, with home cooked taste. Recommend making it for happy hour."}
{"text":"I love their new space! Excellent design and their restroom was pretty cool too! It's a mix of vintage and modern which I loved. We got the Mac + Cheese, Smoked tomatoes and OKRA! YES OKRA! That was my favorite. Of course their drinks were so good and the service was excellent. Congratulations once again on the opening and we look forward to coming in again!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, I read the reviews from \"New-times the best of,\" and had a high expectation to eat. My veggie burger was bitter because it was burned on one side and I asked them, \"is it normal burning bitter like this?\" They said YES. (Only one side?? ). Really? I had better veggie burger even at Fat burger or even at Na mi.  The flavor was nice actually on the first bite before I bite the burned side :(. I am little bit disappointed.  The prices for 2 burgers (veggie and peanut butter burger) and 1 lemon pie homemade (with over-dozed sugar flavor in one side and strong lemon taste at the center) total $20-ish.  Peanut butter burger was good especially for them who love peanut butter in their burger."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The atmosphere is just phenomenal! It's very quaint and charming. When you're done taking in the awesomeness of the outdoor seating strategically placed around beautiful trees and string lighting, you get to the walk up window where you check out their ever changing specials menu board or the regular menu with a wide variety of fun dishes to choose from. They also have a full bar with a drink menu which I was pretty happy about! The food is all made in house with the very freshest local ingredients, even down to the Chipotle ranch dressing (which was to die for) the staff was fun, friendly and charismatic and the price was fantastic for the quality! And to top it all off, they were easily able to accommodate our large birthday group!  I will definitely be going back with as many people as I can drag with me to show off this hidden gem in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE is great. I love this joint. The staff is awesome and the food is great. Their grilled cheese is so good. I also love their beer selection and their full bar. I have a hard time decided what to order when I go here because everything looks so good. This place is tucked away and can easily be passed up, but don't make that mistake. I love it here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food is amazing! We did wait a little too long for our food to come out but this place is one of the cutest diners in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"There is not really a bad time to go to welcome dinner (unless you dont like big crowds) I find it fits so many different situations perfectly . this little gem has some of the best food in phoenix . and will for sure fill up even the most hungry of you out there. They don't mess around. Must try spot in down town"}
{"text":"Wow, I love it when food surprises me. Here's the run down of our food. -Fried Green Tomato sandwich = AMAZING  -Mac & Cheese = Best and creamiest M&C I ever had. The burned very top bits adds another dimension of flavor and texture. My picky toddler could not get enough of it -Fried jack fruit - so good -Big Jim - Good but too rich & heavy for me Go, eat, and be happy"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed. I would recommend visiting through the week if possible.   I ordered the little birdy (chicken,biscuit,cheese) it was good but a little hard to handle. Also had the jambalaya as an appetizer (big enough for 2 to share) I would order it as an entree next time.   The seating arrangements are mostly outdoor, which is fine when the weather is nice like it has been in March but would be a bit much in summer months.   My rating is based on the items I liked, I didn't go 5 star based on the price points of some items and the lack of soft drink options. This wouldn't deter me from returning in the future."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom.  The food here is so delicious!  My personal favorite is the fried green tomato sandwich and next would be the carol.  Of course my all time favorite is no longer on the menu, i am told if requested when not slammed, if all ingredients are there, they will make that too!  Goodness I love this place.  If you haven't eaten here, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Always great atmosphere, very relaxing and casual! The food can be a little inconsistent, but by far a fantastic spot for a snack and a drink!"}
{"text":"They have a vegan option. It's nice to have more options near the Garfield that are open late too. Also, it's all about the grilled cheese on the biscuit with bacon added. The sides that come with the dishes are disappointing. I'd prefer a smaller/easier to eat sandwich with some sauteed veggies."}
{"text":"great place! love the food and the employees are accommodating! The No Way Jose is amazing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I have such a great time when I done here with my friends :) we've had the privilege of eating both inside and outside. Indoors, our friend group basically took up all of the barstools, but the environment was fun because you get to have the bartender right in front of you, see the meals being prepared, and be right in the middle of all the action! Outdoors, it is easier to talk to all of the people in your group and when the weather is beautiful outside why not  :) I've only ordered the Big Jim and it's hard to venture away from a dish you already love! There's just something about fried chicken and gravy in-between 2 biscuits that make the perfect combination! The Poutine is delicious and there is definitely enough of it to share! My friends ordered the PB Burger, The Koko, and the No Way Jose which they were very thrilled about! Cocktails are wonderful as well! I recommend this place to everyone I know and I'm always looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! You should try it! It's a dining experience unlike any other!   Nice job Welcome Diner!"}
{"text":"This place makes me wish it was mine! The best home made biscuits, juicy off the bone fried chicken, great collard greens, and amazing catfish po boy."}
{"text":"Love this spot lowkey great food and service food was juicy mad at my self for being stuffed n not able to finish it"}
{"text":"Oh my diner oh my diner oh my Diii-ner on Roosevelt--  So I usually don't eat at diners because food ain't all that great.  But where there is jackfruit I will follow.  Welcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.  Even though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.    Paired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.  Welcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious?   [crickets]  Doesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   \"Sounding\" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.    No side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.     And so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.  (That list is quite long, but let me not diverge from the review.)     Anyway, I will return someday for another jackfruit po'boy, but at $8 bucks with no side, my next visit won't be too soon."}
{"text":"My wife, the picky vegetarian had some bizarre avocado sandwich and a side of brussel sprouts.  If we end up moving to Phoenix, this restaurant may be the reason why."}
{"text":"Welcome Diner Crew Great! The food was also very tasty and will be a go back to place in the near future."}
{"text":"I love the nostalgia of a Valentine Diner having grown up with one next door. This group of chef's make it hard to like overall but some of their inventions are superb. Overpriced, overworked menu ideas are from newbe Chefs, I pray you get over it and think good food for everyone. I had the fried green tomato sandwich which underwhelmed with mushy tomato which the corn relish could not help. Hard to believe $8 for a side of Mac & Cheese but I ordered it. It wasn't the worst I have endured but far from acceptable, no flavor and texture was again, mush. Don't know where all these great Yelp reviews come from but I am losing faith in Yelp."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night. Everything was great, especially the food, except for how long we had to wait. It felt like an hour. I had to cancel my after dinner plans because it took so long."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places now. Simple menu but great food with some inventive twists. Mostly burgers, salads, biscuits (biscuit sandwiches), and sides (fries, slaw), few other things. Cool vibe. Mostly outdoor seating, never experienced this place in mid-summer, must be scorching--then again, it's only open at night when it's cooler.  Oh, and yeah, only open after 5pm (typically). I'm there now, surrounded by all college age kids as I type this. EDIT: I felt I must update and drop a star because 1) the outdoor furniture is extremely old and weathered, and not just rustic, and 2) there were quite a few ants on the narrow table/bench where I sat outside.  I can understand these things being \"normal\" for \"normal\" situation outdoors, but \"normal\" doesn't get 5-star ratings. They should get refurbished furniture and go crazy on insect control."}
{"text":"I had fun visiting welcome diner! Open super late and some amazing unique options. I think it's cool how they have mostly outdoor seating, makes this place unique. There were a few vegetarian options which looked amazing but I went for the jackfruit sandwich, my boyfriend and I also shared Mac n cheese. My boyfriend got a biscuit with fried chicken and he thought it was awesome!  My sandwich was incredible, a crunchy baguette with perfectly spiced jackfruit! I had grabbed ketchup just in case but didn't even need it. My boyfriend didn't like the charred top of the mac n cheese but I thought it was good. He did like the underneath part of it. We also tried the home-brewed ginger beer and it was tasty! The ginger was extremely strong but very good. Took a while to get our food but this was a fun place to just hang out so it was not a problem. We both can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this a bad review because i honestly was hoping to love this place. I was expecting to give it 5 stars along with the rest of the reviews.. But of course that wasnt the case. Its cute and small but great for spending time with friends. I love the fact that its open till 2am. The only issue i had is their food is not that good i felt. To start before i even got to order and was looking at the menu i had a friend with me that had takeout from another place. We were approached by a young lady named Christina who told him he couldnt bring in the food because of the liquor license and that he needed to \"get out\". I could understand a beverage from somewhere else but a liquor license has nothing to do with food. The thing was she had a bit of an attitude which really turned me off to not even order anymore, but i still did regardless because i wanted to try this place.  I ordered the poutine fries which i was really hoping to be good seeing all the pictures and reviews for it. Like everyone said the wait time for your food is truly ridiculous. I ordered my food take out only to watch others that came after me be served their take out.. All in all it took 56 minutes for french fries and a side of gravy.  For $9 french fries i expected them to be good.. maybe i came too late or on an off day for the cooks but i feel i could have honestly ate better fries at a McDonalds.. A young guy i believe to be the manager came out and apologized for the misunderstanding of Christina shooing us out. He let us know that she was confused on the liquor license that it was only for outside beverages not food. Props to him for being kind enough to do that. But on the other hand the employees should ask questions if they are unsure on something before jumping on someone. Its common respect for the employees and customers.  Would i be back? Unlikely."}
{"text":"Authentic, quaint location. Best spot for burgers in all of Maricopa. Homemade ginger beer (non alcoholic) and  FLAVORFUL vegan options. Cute,Dog-friendly, outdoor setting! My only complaint is that it opens at 5..I've caught myself on multiple occasions auto piloting to Welcome Diner just to knock myself in the head for forgetting its not open during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a Suns game. Great location off of the busy streets. Nice little spot but dont let it fool you. The food is more on the gourmet side, they have a nice selection of alcoholic drinks. Not much room inside the diner but plenty of room outside. They have heat lamps if its that time of year. Service was very friendly and the person who took our order was very informative and was talking about where they get their bacon from AMAT ngst other details.  I ordered the PoBoy fish sandwich and friend got the Big Jim chicken biscuit. No sides came with our food except some watermelon. I didnt taste the big jim but looked good and my friend said it was great. PoBoy was very good and whatever sauce they use in it was outstanding   I would def come back again for the price i wish they included some kind if side besides the watermelon but overall excellent experience and food. Check it out"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place downtown..maybe in all of Phoenix. I have eaten their pork fries, big jim, pb&b, and the poutine and I've got to say that everything is beyond incredible. Their Hurricanes are the best drinks! Staff is always friendly and the food is so worth the price. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing melt in your mouth food,  affordable, funny down to earth staff, fun visits! Go here now!"}
{"text":"First let me say that all the boys working here are super cute. So that was a bonus!! I had The Big Jim and it was delicious! Next time I will get the fried egg on top!! Oh and I also had an orange drink, can't remember the name but it ruled!"}
{"text":"So good, I'll eat on a patio when it's 35 degrees out.   Gone are the days of diners as restaurants with incredibly greasy food and questionable cleanliness. The future of diners is here, with its eclectic flavors that appeal to carnivores and vegans alike. You're going to find the dish for you here, I guarantee it.   There's a small trailer with indoor bar seating. Good luck getting in there, as the space is obviously limited. For everyone else, you're gonna walk up to a window and swiftly have your order placed. They take cash and credit, as long as you're not too much of a \"baller\" carrying above $20 bills. I think some RoRo newcomers might have trouble with that. ;-)   A little birdie on my shoulder told me to keep it simple and go with, well, the Little Birdie. With simply fried chicken and cheddar on a biscuit, it's great to test the waters and see how welcome really shines. My chicken was perfect! I would seem it took a little dip in buttermilk before being introduced to a tasty batter. I can really tell these cooks know their chicken. The biscuit was amazing as well--I'd go as far as to say it's the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi. My vegetarian dining companion went with the jackfruit fries. I'd only had the fruit once before, and I'm not an expert on preparation, but I will say it was definitely tasty and a great meat substitute.   Everything was washed down with a pint of PBR, but if you want something a little fancier, there are a few craft beers, and a generous cocktail list. For a very small price, I walked away happy and eager to return!"}
{"text":"First off don't get nervous trying out this place because of it's location. It's an outdoor diner. You can sit inside but there's only a few seats available. They play old school songs, which is nice to listen to. I loved the fries that we got and the corn dog. Big Jim was very delicious too! It was perfect with the gravy! I wasn't a big fan of koko and only had a bite out of it. It had an unusual taste to it."}
{"text":"I was SO, SO very excited to try this place. I had been asking my husband to try this spot for months. We finally had dinner here over the weekend and that's the last time I get excited over an eatery again. I ordered the Big Jim and my husband had the Grilled Cheese with extra bacon, we shared mac and cheese and \"poutine\". I had a beer and he had a Coke. The Big Jim was basically slop on a plate. I have never seen something that looked so messy and that was so difficult to eat! I tried to eat the thing and it just wasn't gonna happen. I didn't want to further embarrass myself and I was so over trying to eat it, that I decided to take it home. My husband's grilled cheese DIDN'T come with the extra bacon he ordered. Instead it was served to him on a little plate. Really? The \"poutine\"? Try sausage gravy over fries. Where were the cheese curds and the delicious light brown gravy?! No cheese of any sort. What a joke! Totally NOT poutine. Stars for the Mac and Cheese and beer because that was the only enjoyable thing in front of my face.  In closing - We spent around $60.00 on overpriced bland food. The tip is automatically added to your bill at check out which pissed me off. I'll tip what I WANT to tip, not what you're TELLING me to tip. Patrons also taxed for beer, non alcoholic beverage and food. Charge after charge on the receipt that's sent via text. I realize we all pay for it one way or another, but seeing all those little charges annoyed the crap out of. Especially because my food sucked.   What an underwhelming, expensive experience!"}
{"text":"This is my late night joint. Fire biscuit selection. Staff is fantastic and loving. Top 5 pics In Phoenix handdddds down."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try out this unique place after all the amazing photos I have seen on Instagram.  First of all I love the hours, even through the mid week they are open late!  Driving through the downtown neighborhood to get here is kinda sketchy in the middle of not so decent area. So don't be scared your going the right way haha  Walking up to the Welcome diner it was so sweet how it's all set up! You can sit inside but only if there's room, it a bar top for 3 people. However, outside is where the fun is, the hanging lights, the awesome community tables are everywhere. The menu is short and to the point. I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and the Sunrise. The fried green sandwich was a little hit to bite for the first few minutes but wow, how amazing it was! The sunrise was so delicious  with the chorizo, I will have to try the other choices next time. To wash it down I got the house made ginger beer which was so refreshing I wanted more!  If you come here and don't mind waiting for a few extra long minutes for your food it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come sit outside. Really delicious food. Love coming late night for whiskey sours too. Staff is always awesome."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I love the biscuit sandwiches particularly the bumblebee. The cocktails are unique and delicious.  Last night I tried the fried green tomato sandwich and it was out of this world. I took the advice of the person taking my order and added bacon. it was so amazing I want one right now.   I also had the mac and cheese which was amazing. I have not had a bad thing here.  And unlike a lot of the downtown establishments the hipsters working here smile and say thank you and stuff. so refreshing. thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here late sat night (thanks Yelp fam)and the place was buzzing. However we loved the vibe and the whole concept. It was a perfect night to sit outside. They do have indoor seating but very limited. The crowd was very hipster/bohemian/eclectic, I think that covers it. We even sat with a table full of complete strangers (cause that's what I do) they were a fun group of folks.   We decided on the Mac and cheese along with the biscuits and gravy. They were both delicious and the biscuits were sooooo good. Oh and the homemade ginger beer (non alch) was really good too. Unfortunately we were to full to try the beignets, but will def try next time.  Overall this is a place I would go out of my way to go enjoy some good food and some good people. Staff was very personable and great at making suggestions on what to try!  Neighborhood is def sketch as some Yelpers have commented on... But we no scared..lol"}
{"text":"Loved my first time here ! Got here by 6pm which was perfect because we beat the rush. I would not want to be here when there is a line, but if you have the time and want a leisurely night out a line is worth the wait even so. However, with that being said do not.come here starving because you do have a bit of a wait for your food, understandable though the place is tiny and the food comes out incredibly fresh !!   We got the fried green tomato sandwich with bacon added it was so good with great textures and flavors..bread a bit too crisp (blackened) at some points but a unique and yummy dish. We also had the bumblebee biscuit sandwich which was really good, the chicken was moist, crunchy , but not filling enough despite it being heavy. We also got the happy hour pork fries, prettty good, but I'll get plain fries next time, liked the slaw and the sauce on top.  Food good, staff was very helpful, local beer, and cool atmosphere.   I would come here again for sure.  I had to deduct one star only because of the bathroom situation ...I'm borderline germaphobe and I almost couldn't stand the bathroom. It's a unisex , airline bathroom size stall with a sliding/folding door, that is right off the kitchen line !! Eek, kinda crazy, just avoid needing a restroom if you are a germaphobe, and even more so if you're extreme about it.   Welcome Diner ,you're great I hope to visit in the summer to keep the spirit alive !"}
{"text":"Solid 5. Totally chill attitude from the guys behind the counter serving up killer food. To start: an Old Fashion for me and a Candy Corn signature for the wife. We split not one but two orders of the bacon and cheese fries, and had the biscuit w chicken, gravy, and bacon. All fantastic. Go here anytime if you got a hankering for comfort food after a hangover or just because. We'll be back soon. And we're bringing friends."}
{"text":"Great food with custom cocktails.  Family friendly and good local people who are friendly running the place."}
{"text":"Got the Carol, brussel sprouts, and insanely delicious mac. Melted with different kinds of cheese and blow torched to a perfect crisp. Deeeeeeelish"}
{"text":"The Little Bird was amazing! I prefer my Mac n Cheese baked, but the portion size exceeded my expectations. Louisiana Pure Crystal Hot Sauce makes everything taste better tho! The Hurricane was perfect and the Wiskey Sour meh. Will be back to taste the jackfruit fries, a burger and beignets!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great little gem located in central Phoenix. I have been here numerous times and the food is outstanding. My favorite is the PB&J burger, it's not something I would normally order but sometimes you have to take chances on food.   If you are looking to sit inside the tiny trailer that only fits about 10 make sure to get there when they first open. The place gets really packed, but there is additional seating outside. If you a first timer I would recommend sitting inside because the staff is great along with their drinks."}
{"text":"I tried the pull jackfruits po' boy(vegan) the first time, loved it! and the fish po' boy the second time and oh boy was I happy  with the fish po' boy since I'm a  pescatarian, it was probably the best fish sandwich I've had. I want to go again and try everything I can eat. Also please try the honey soaked beignets they serve so you can die happy."}
{"text":"Love their burgers.. Great atmosphere .. I suggest you guys come early to beat the rush.. The peanut butter burger is amazing.."}
{"text":"I saved my 400th Yelp review for this Phoenix gem. This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.  The best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.  I can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).  The crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on. If you want something funky and delicious and scratch-made, you would do well to pound a path to this wiggity-wack little diner in the middle of a dusty old Phoenix neighborhood. Off the beaten path, as it were..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Got the sunrise with chorizo, and my husband got a burger that he really liked. It took a while (45 min) to get the food, but I was understanding considering how small their kitchen and cooktop were.. And how busy they were (always a good sign). We also ordered a dessert at the same time we ordered dinner, and FORTY minutes AFTER we finished our dinner (a total of an hour and a half of waiting), still nothing. I pulled our waiter aside and asked him about them, he nicely said, \" they're the next order up.\" Ok.. I was Pissed off, but I let it go. Another 15 minutes goes by, 4 OTHER orders to different tables that got there an hour after we did... NOTHING. Got up and left. He watched us leave and said nothing. A lot of distractions happening, and with the prices they have, they need to deliver not only with taste (which I will say, they did) but with service also. Just because you serve good food does not mean you can make people wait for over an hour and a half for it. Not that worth it."}
{"text":"Welcome diner was very satisfying! We pulled up and I was like crap this place is either gonna be really good or really bad. We got the bumblebee and big jack with a side of Mac and cheese (added bacon). Wasn't a huge fan of Mac and cheese... It tasted a bit strange. The bumblebee was amazing with added hot sauce. I didn't try the big Jack because he finished it in two bites which meant it was pretty good! Best cheat meal there ever was - minus the Mac and cheese. It was a bit more expensive than I thought it would be... 47 with tip."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Phoenix,  looking forward to the new location for more seating in the Garfield. The entire crew who make up welcome are truly wonderful and know how to make you feel at home. And obviously the food and drinks are the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 1am expecting to grub on some good late night food and head home.  We entered the dining area, were seated, and a few minutes later were brought some water.  After that...nothing.  We waited about 20 minutes (my wife said it was more like 30) for someone to take our order, while others came in and were seated.  When we noticed a waitress begin to take the order of a couple that came in after us, we just left.  I understand it's a super laid back restaurant, with lots of \"hey bro\" being exchanged between the staff and the regulars (they also called some guy Mas Puto) but maybe they should also focus on their core business- serving food.  We were forced to eat jack in the box."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface with the fact that we came here after First Friday. My partner and I had just finished vending and were looking for a way to celebrate the end of the night. We're old birds that don't stay up very late, so late night dining is fairly foreign to us, especially in Phoenix. We yelped and found Welcome Diner. Our company was delighted that I had mentioned it as she had been here previously. An antsy me took that as a good sign and didn't even think about needing to wait in line.   When we first walked up to the diner, we noticed a huge amount of people sitting outside, a very long line, and a few groups standing around. My partner and I joined the groups of people standing around trying to look for somewhere else to go. We really didn't feel like waiting in line. We couldn't get ahold of our company to switch gears, so we ended up just standing in line. When they arrived, we were reassured that the wait would be worth it. We waited 56 minutes in line... FIFTY SIX MINUTES. There had to be approximately ~13 people in front of us. When we finally got to the front of the line, we had to wait another 10 before the guy that was just sitting there took out order. The kitchen looked really busy, but definitely the long line was a little more than they can handle it seemed. I'm not one to wait too long for food, so this was just a miserable experience for me. I promise I'll move on from the wait times soon...but we literally waited another 48 minutes for out food to come out.   Moving on...  Pulled Jackfruit Po'Boy - 3.5/5 - Jackfruit was WAY too saucy and salty. Just a reminder to everyone and anyone that makes pulled jackfruit with BBQ...a little bit of BBQ goes a long way. You don't need to drench it. This made the \"toasted\" much too soggy for my liking. I was told that this would be the best pulled jackfruit I'd ever had... and I believed it because of the line, but I was sorta disappointed.   Mac & Cheese - 5/5 - okay, this was really damn delicious, enough said.  Jackfruit Fries - 4/5 I think I would've preferred this as my choice dish over the Po'boy. The fries just went better than the baguette   All in all- I really hated that I had to wait so long for this meal. If I had not been with good company and company that I had not seen for ages...I wouldn't have waited. I wasn't amazed with the food, but I'd give it another try, so long as I did not have to wait two hours."}
{"text":"This place was \"eh\". I really don't understand all the hype. The chicken I ordered was over cooked and dry. The food took forever and the service was not something to brag about."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere more than anything else.  As a visitor to Phoenix, I am not use to this heat but the calm warm nights are the perfect setting for outdoor seating (though there is a small indoor diner bar). There are plenty of tables, lights and a gatorade water cooler to satisfy that thirst.  I got the Big Jim and a side of Brussels sprouts ($14 total).  Brussels Sprouts are cut large and I felt they could have been cooked down a bit more or cut smaller for my liking.  The Big Jim on the other hand was quite tasty.  Fried Chicken, Biscuit and Gravy.  How good is that?  Oh, there is bacon and cheese too....damn. I would ask for extra gravy on the side next time.  Watermelon on the side was a perfect pairing to this rich dish.  Compostable cup, +1"}
{"text":"As good as it gets as far as diners go.  I'm not usually considered to be a hipster, but it might rub off on me if I spent more time her.  Great crowd hanging out eating delicious food.  Tiny enough that you HAVE to talk to the staff, they're right next to you.  Unless you sit outside.  That might be fun, too.  I've never actually been to a diner that had a liquor license, so have a hurricane with your brunch."}
{"text":"Such a cool hidden spot! The restaurant environment was awesome. Definitely not what I expected when looking from the outside in, but the amazing food and menu options make all your doubts go away for sure. I had the KoKo biscuit and that was very good. The chipotle sauce is what makes it. When seeing \"biscuit\" I was unsure if it was going to enough to fill me but when it came out it was a big enough biscuit to fill you up! The entrees are greatly portioned. My mom ordered Jambalaya which she loved saying it was a \"blast of flavors\" and different from what she's had before. She and I also shared the delicious French fries (great size to share!). And to top it all off the beignets were literally fresh out the fryer! Overall amazing place! Wanna go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing diner, great locally sourced selections that change out daily/weekly. Small location with limited seating, but great if you get there early. Try their alcoholic special drinks, love the selection and it changes often. Ask about the history of the place, awesome story!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at this place, and the fact that the food is great, too, makes this one of our favorite neighborhood haunts. With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place.   There are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own.   Other highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned.   The service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they? After all, Welcome Diner is a true neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Retro setting, organic food, and friendly service.  FOOD Well, it's a diner so you have burgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc to choose from. The burgers have always been cooked as I like them (whatever your preference is...) The fries are organic potatoes, cut daily- sometimes a little on the brown side in appearance but they always taste good.  Grilled cheese is great- not too greasy like some places.  There are sodas and iced tea to drink- both organic.  ENVIRONMENT 8  seats inside and outdoor seating availible. I would recommend eating outside if it is nice- sometimes inside is crowded and everyone can hear everyone else's business.   OTHER Bring cash, no cards accepted. If your service is good- tip them. They are really nice!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. It has a cute ambiance and very tasty locally sourced food. Even the beer and wine, I noticed, were local. I got the Champion burger and my husband got the No Way Jose and both were delicious. A thick, perfectly cooked patti, with perfect seasoning and compliments. I really loved the bacon jam on the Champion. I'd totally go back!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Food is 5 stars. Service is meh. 3 stars for service. The gripe on the service is probably more to my personal taste. The place is very hipster, customers and servers. I think it would be difficult to be an apathetic hipster and provide quality customer service. Nobody was rude or anything, just blah. It certainly isn't going to stop me from being a repeat customer."}
{"text":"When we got there it was late at night.(almost their close) and they were out of everything. No problem they asked us what we wanted and they made substitutes and the food was delicious. Wow. I mean yes it was late night eats but I wouls get this at any time of the day.  Looove it."}
{"text":"The Welcome Diner is, in a word, welcoming! The folks who work there are super friendly and great to talk to. It's a small and intimate little place so expect to have some cool conversations with other patrons.   Be prepared with cash and a sweatband (or five!). In the summer heat, it's a bit hot in there, but everyone looks a little sexier with a bead or two of sweat on their forehead, no?   I got a grilled cheese (made with lettuce, tomato & bread n butter pickles) and fresh cut fries that are to die for. Way better than In N' Out's just so you know. And the chocolate chip cookie. Oh how its nutmeg danced on my taste buds! I liked it. A lot a lot.  They get everything they can from local & organic growers, have phenomenally yummilicious bread and even Mexican Coca-Cola. Hooray for real sugar cane! Too bad I realized this after I ordered a diet coke. I'll splurge on some calories if it means I get to drink from a glass bottle any day.  I'm so glad my friend showed me this place. It is a definite gem and I will definitely be back. When it cools down, I may even bring the pooch along and sit outside near the kiddie pool. Fun!   If you haven't yet, grab a friend and try this joint out pronto."}
{"text":"The people are really cool.  Excellent food made from local ingredients. The chicken biscuit sandwich is yummy. Also, must indulge in the poutine. Fun place with lots of misters running over the picnic tables outside which kept us cool. Must check this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The Food was Great, my fiance had a welcome burger and the just custom made me a breakfast burger. The chef came in and made a burger he had just created and gave us a taste. Would totally drive down from LA again for another bite"}
{"text":"I'm kind of a big deal around here...lol The fried green tomato on a biscuit with an egg....what....that's right...go there....orgasmic flavor explosions....everybody here is like family...great concept great people and amazing food. Just reminds me of a queens New York diner with way better food. Chef Michael Babcock is nothing short of genius. Ask for the \"David\" and your life will be changed...open til 2...get your fix. See you there. Big up to Wayne, matt, peter, rob, kyle, and the rest of my FAM..."}
{"text":"We just had a wonderful diner at our new favorite local place. The food was very good, I had the welcome burger and my wife had the chicken on a biscuit that had aioli sauce on it. We shared a pulled pork fries that was delicious. My burger was one of the better ones that I have had. My wife had a Ginger Beer (NA) that was so good she had another. Friendly staff and great service. Seating is outside a diner with a walk up window. We had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Open late so if ya do go put and still want to get food ya can. Check out the sluricane. It's a very tasty potent drink."}
{"text":"Make sure not to zone out while you're driving to the Welcome Diner or you'll zip right past it (as my friend and I did).  It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.  My friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.  I ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's)."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood location, great laid back environment (outdoor seating only), extremely friendly staff, and a deliciously unique menu. We'll be coming here often!"}
{"text":"As a student, late night munchies happen all the time. Welcome diner always cures."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate with family and friends and had Delicious Bloody Mary's and feasted on some good ole homemade food for the Soul!  Holy Puerco is The headliner followed by the Bumble bee !  Had a bite of the  peanut butter burger and it was delicious!   Come check them out!   Cool spot!"}
{"text":"Going over the reviews I'm beginning to think that I'm either crazy or just show up on off nights. The food is alright but the service is so bad that if you told me it was a gimmick I would not be surprised. Rude self righteous hipsters who treat people like idiots. I would bet money that they are the slowest restaurant in Phoenix. The slow service and the bad attitudes are the only things consistent about welcome dinner. They are constantly running out of menu items. Again I feel that this is a hipster gimmick but who knows.   If you like to sit outside and enjoy being treated like \"you don't get it\" while you wait 45 minutes for your food then hop on your fixy and head on down to Welcome Diner. Where food and service come second to how cool they are."}
{"text":"Tried the fried tomato sandwich, jackfruit sandwich, fries, and squash blossoms... all absolutely fantastic! We also really enjoyed the biscuit with jam for dessert. Everything about this place was great, there was plenty of parking and it wasn't crowded on a Saturday night. The chef and staff were friendly, funny, and so much fun. The diner lived up to its name and if I had one last/first/only meal in Phoenix it would be here."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years... And this is my first review ever and it had to be for my favorite place in Phoenix. Everything on the menu is fabulous!! Even the PB&B burger that I never thought I would try... Amazing. Their slaw and Brussels sprouts are on point!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Poutin  is great! Very hipster style atmosphere. Mostly outside seating. Located in a little neighborhood. Rough to sit outside during summer months. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great little diner. I've lived right down the block and never stopped in. When I found out they had food until 2am I stopped it. Love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"May I just say that the service and food here is awesome?!  I'm in the industry myself and don't like going into a restaurant so close to closing, but we were hungry for good food and they just so happened to be open. The service and food we received was very good quality. They serve burgers provided by Niman Ranch and have an open bar. John Luther (Awesome name, btw!) took our order and was very friendly the entire time. The three of us ordered the No Way Jose Burger which came with a choice of fries or cole slaw. The price is pretty reasonable: $10.75 for the burger and fries. We each also ordered 3 Hess Cream Ales and 3 burgers for a grand total of $55.82.   The atmosphere was very chill and the clientele, for the hour, was very friendly. We will definitely be coming back here again soon! Especially since it's only a few blocks away!  Also, shout out to Dreya(?), our chef for the night. Great job!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix to meet up with some friends and we settled on this place for our Friday evening dinner plans.  Location & Aesthetics -- Located just on the corner of E Roosevelt & N 10th St. in Phoenix. Parking is limited to the street or in the small area behind the diner though I think the diner staff park there. Seating is mostly outdoors.  There is seating within the diner but it's small so if you're coming with a crowd, then I'd recommend dining outside.   There are string bulb lights outside with powerful misters, and large tables and chairs.  It is sandy outside so you may want to wear shoes versus flip flops.   Outside area was very clean and well kept.  Tables were clean as well. Noise level is nonexistent except for the passing vehicle or two from the street.    Service -- Staff are very friendly and helpful explaining items from the menu including drinks.  Upon arriving, you order at the little window at the side of the diner.  Provide then with your order, pay, then go sit.  Your drinks and food will be brought out to you.  Menu -- Lots of available menus right next to the order window - drinks and meal menus.  Menus were easy to understand with small descriptions of the dishes or drinks.    Food -- I had the Welcome burger which didn't disappoint.  Made to my liking as requested and to cooked to perfection, it was mouthwatering, flavorful, well seasoned, and juicy. I had a side of fries with fresh cut, cooked well, hot, and slightly drizzled with salt along with a chopped seasoning (don't know the name) on it but it certainly added extra flavor. For my drink, I order a couple of Hurricanes which also was made to perfection -- not too sweet and not too tart with accurate proportions of rum and other integral ingredients.  Overall, very happy with the place, staff and terrific food.  Will definitely recommend and would love to return to try their fried chicken with biscuits plus their poutine fries which I spied other folks eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great biscuits and gravy sandwiches.  I wish that they had more indoor seating for the summertime, but that is the only thing I would change.  Pro tip: come hungry"}
{"text":"Omg! Please try their JACKFRUIT FRIES They Are the best I have never had! Vegan on top of it :) So So So Good! I promise you wont be disappointed;) they have the best patio and drink too their homemade ginger beer is so refreshing and unique give both of this thing a try!Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food and drinks! My friends and I had a great time, they were playing great music and we had good conversation with the bartenders and even the cook. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"After leaving a so-so review of 3 stars due to issues with service, I was contacted by the GM of the restaurant, Wayne, to discuss my experience. He apologized and offered to send a gift card my way. I was totally blown away and impressed! This restaurant and their staff really do care about your experience, and I'm happy to say that I will be coming back and telling my friends to go too. Huge thumbs up to Welcome Diner!   BTW: Fried Green Tomato sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm only in Phoenix for a few days but I'm tellin ya I will be coming back here before I leave. Hospitality: the best. Ever. Food: I tried the welcome burger medium rare AND IT WAS SO GOOD. Definitely gonna try the Mac and cheese with chorizo next time. The people that work here might as well be family; they're a really tight knit group and we had two of the employees come talk to us--Mike and Wayne: really cool chill guys. You might at first be weirded out by the location (it's in the middle of a bunch of houses) but it adds to the homely feeling that I experienced while at the welcome diner."}
{"text":"Love the new location! Great atmosphere, delicious food and yummy cocktails!!! The jackfruit fries topped with purple coleslaw is one of my favorites. The brussel sprouts and wonderful. The yellow jacket cocktail is visually appealing and delicious."}
{"text":"Ummm BOMB! I had the Big jim? Hopefully thats what it's called it was a biscuit, with fried chicken, and gravy with syrup. The chicken was so awesome so tender! The wait staff was awesome as well!!!! Thanks for a great time!!"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place to go on date night. Not too loud and very urban/ hipster setting. The only draw backs, which is why I'm removing a Star, are the seating is very limited and over dirt and the chairs are uncomfortable. The food and service is great though!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Stumbled upon it on Yelp.    Very small, intimate indoor seating and plenty of outdoor seating.    The juice was fresh, the coffee fair trade, the Big Jim, a mountain of fried chicken and gravy.    Plus all the dudes that worked there were super friendly."}
{"text":"I would have given 4.5 stars, but, you get it.  Loved my experience at Welcome. The casual nature was inviting and the food was outstanding. The cocktails were slightly underwhelming, but overall, I can't wait to come back for a second visit!"}
{"text":"Welcome Diner in its latest incarnation is a gem. Their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service, but you'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late, at least during the summer, as most of their seating is outside.  The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better.   The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.  The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.  The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits. Their biscuits are a thing of beauty, either with honey on them, or as part of the chicken sandwiches; they're simply perfect.  They're just a hop-skip off the 7th St. I-10 exit, and well worth trying out."}
{"text":"I can't begin to describe how cool this place is. Imagine growing up with your best buds, and you all happen to be amazing cooks. These guys love what they do, and food is their craft. Everything is made from scratch and taste so good. You could literally order anything and you will be mind blown. My girl ordered the bumblebee. I was so happy when she was too full to eat it all lol. Best biscuits ever. Thanks for the great food! They also have really good drinks, their ginger beer is house made and totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is my 4th visit, 1st time eating there.  Went on Sept 25th around 630pm.  It was alittle warm and surprised there was no misters on.  My wife came with.  We ordered 2 mix drinks, shared the Champion Burger and fries(very good) and shared the macaroni and cheese with tomato confiti.  It came out to 36$ plus 5$ tip.  My wife loved the macaroni, I thought it was alittle bland, maybe it was the confiti.  So far on my visits, I've had the hamburgers and chicken biscuit with gravy, all very good.  We both love the ambiance, the outdoor seating and the friendlyness of the staff and customers.  It's only 5 blocks from our house so it's very close."}
{"text":"Atmosphere just right and such warm friendly staff. Really accommodating. We felt very well taken cared of. Good stuff: Eggs over easy were perfect, smooth grits. Waffle batter is sweetened so some might opt for no powdered sugar, and a little doughey. They were able to do Omelette as a Scramble which was so nice. Area is funky but all was well with our car. ."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. Full disclosure, I'd had a few beers before stopping in, but I stand by my statement. I was expecting the usual greasy 1am fare and was blown away. A friend and I shared the fried green tomato sandwich and the grilled cheese. Both were outstanding, but I'd have to say the tomato was the standout. The sourdough bread they were served on was a treat in itself. We finished up with the beignets with local honey and powdered sugar which were also insanely delicious. A little different than what I've had in New Orleans, but c'mon, deep fried dough and sugar. You can't go wrong. The honey gave it kind of an Arizona twist. The staff was really friendly and came by twice to ask us how our food was. I'll definitely be back!! Gotta have some biscuits next time."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could afford it. Big Jim is ammmazzzing and the iced tea is perfectly made !"}
{"text":"The world needs more places like this. Honest yummy creative food in a casual chill environment. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We went to the Welcome Diner on \"First Friday\" earlier this month.  We'll be back for sure.  It's a very casual atmosphere with some limited indoor seating along a counter and more seating outside.  We each enjoyed our meals.  I eat vegan and loved the Vegan Po'Boy; my son is a vegetarian and he loved the grilled cheese sandwich; and my wife, the carnivore of the family, really liked her fried chicken sandwich.  They try to use local foods.  The staff was great, as was the music they were playing."}
{"text":"We actually came here through Yelp's help, looking for a diner or a brunch place close to the Az Science Center. Dont be deceived or be scared by the neighborhood, it is not the suburbs, it is within a residential area in Downtown Phoenix. This place is a cross between a food truck that mutated into a tiny diner: the inside has 9 seats and a bar and their kitchen and outside has this \"picnic\" feel which has tables with umbrellas and chairs. Our family of 5 (with kids ages 8, 7 and 5) chose to sit inside. We were there upon opening, the waiter and cook (Wayne and Clay, if I remember correctly) were very attentive to our family's needs. My hubby got the Big Jim. He said he loved his food except for the biscuit, but he said hes not really into biscuits. But the chicken and gravy were tasty and well-seasoned. Had the fish po' boy and it was juicy! My kids and I were passing our plates, stuffing our faces with each bite of their grilled cheese with rustic tomatoes sandwich, sunrise and my po boy. My 5 year old son whos a really picky eater almost finished his sanwich and thats a lot for him! Im giving Welcome Diner 4 stars, I wish you have more beverage choices for kids like freshly squeezed OJ? Nevertheless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, my favorite place to eat late night in Phoenix. LOVE the set-up with kiosk-type ordering and picnic tables, reminds me of little food joints in the pacific northwest.  I ordered a burger and mac & cheese. Can't go wrong with any of the options. The mac & cheese is some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great little place with fantastic food and drinks. The local hipsters seem to dig it, but it's a family-friendly neighborhood joint too. Small bar inside and picnic tables on the outside patio encourage a community atmosphere. We ended up having a nice conversation with a guy who sat down at our table. :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. Once 7pm rolls around, more people start to arrive - available seating and parking reduces dramatically. Also, I would come before 7 on a Wednesday to take advantage of happy hour 5-7pm.   Our orders took a while to come out. I ordered the Big Jim [$11], which was great. Fried chicken, bacon, gravy, biscuits, cheese. With random pieces of watermelon. The poutine [$9] just with the  gravy on top was meh ahahah. The fries weren't that great.   The beignets were pretty good, except all of the honey sauce pooled into the bottom so the bottom beignets were overly drenched and way too sweet.   The neighborhood is kind of sketchy, but Welcome Diner is on the same street as JoBot and Melt, so you can walk down and enjoy your time there."}
{"text":"I wasn't keen on the idea of eating at a hipster dinner know for its alcohol, but I was proved wrong for sure when we sat down. First of all the vibe here is what is (hipster) but very happy friendly people both behind the counter and what I would suspect are regulars. The employees were very helpful and patient with me taking my time to order, as you have to walk up to one window to do so, and there was a line. So I took a chance on their recommendation and tried the fake pulled pork sandwich. I never even had jackfruit before, so I knew even if it tasted bad it would be a new experience. Wrong again, it was amazing, the flavor the texture all on point. Just wow it almost makes me want to go back to eating pork to try the real one. I mean I've never tasted anything like this before. A must try if you visit"}
{"text":"I would be lying if I said this diner didn't influence me to move to the Garfield district. This is my absolute favorite place. I used to drive all over the valley depending on what mood I was in, and now I pretty much just go to the Welcome Diner. They have about 9 seats inside and quite a bit of patio seating. They have a few nice big outdoor heaters too.  Some things I love  -Excellent quality food sourced from local vendors -Amazing amazing drinks. They make their own bitters, grenadine, squeeze their own lime juice  and even have fresh herbs to put in. Each one I've seen made is with love. -Good service, fun atmosphere -Almost everything is made from scratch -Specials that are (always delicious) experiments, not leftovers. -Catfish Fridays (Try the sampler!)   I would say price wise it's not necessarily cheap, but not expensive. Average plate will run you about $10, but considering the quality and atmosphere I have no problem paying it!   Favorite dishes- PB&B burger Bacon Blue burger Veggie Stallion (housemade edamame and mushroom veggie burger with housemade ricotta) Red beans and rice with sausage Grilled cheese on a housemade biscuit. Try the holy puerco!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The burgers are amazing and the coleslaw is fantastic. 4 stars because it's pretty pricey, but worth it for a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"This was my boyfriend and i's go to spot after I picked him up from the airport. But now that they moved locations and changed up their menu, they took a lot of our faves off of it! I loved their beignets, luxardo (I think that was the name) salad, and a few more I can't remember the names of. Still a good place, but it would be better with the old menu!"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner the other night.  Party of four for drinks and food. It was great ... We had The Koko, Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Avacado Po'Boy and Little Birdy. Rounded out with Carol Fries and Brussels Sprouts. Mmmmmm, Mmmmmm Good.  Added some drinks and friendly banter from Morgan and a good night was had by all!    Thanks Welcome Diner for a great night!"}
{"text":"The food is PHENOMENAL. My wife and I STILL talk about our amazing brunch. The Welcome Diner is an adorable renovated trailer tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Outdoor seating (bring sunscreen, it can get hot). Customer service is fantastic, these guys have no qualms about discussing their food and fav dishes in depth if you're feeling torn between dishes.  Hands down the best brunch I've ever had. Inventive, powerful flavors, generous portions!"}
{"text":"Welcome Diner, talk about fantastic! Browsed around and found this diner, in a neighborhood many would consider not welcoming, they could not be more wrong. The homemade biscuit, made with love and of course incredible honey, just delicious down to the last crumb. A welcoming staff and food that can leave you stuffed! Will definitely keep coming back and invite all who will join. If you your a local you need to eat here, if your visiting phoenix, you need to eat here! As always my yelpers, eat, drink, explore, and buy local!"}
{"text":"Man, to be brutally honest, I was a bit disappointed!  I had heard about this place for about 1.5 years now.  My buddy at work told me about it, as well as a couple of my Yelp friends have reviewed it.  It sounded like a cool concept, it was open late, and some of the food items sounded fantastic.  Me and my buddy had some time to kill before picking up a friend at the airport, so we decided to stop by for some late night grub.  I browsed the menu for a bit and decided to go with an order of poutine, and a Bumblebee sandwich.  Total for those 2 things was a little over 20 bucks!  STEEP!  Anyways, here is how they were.............  Poutine-  These were some fries topped with sausage gravy and cheddar cheese.  A bit different than a \"traditional poutine\", but close enough?  The fries themselves seemed a bit overcooked, like they were left in the fryer an extra 20 seconds or so.  They were a bit brown, but not really \"crispy\".  The sausage gravy tasted ok, and the melted cheddar was kind of \"meh\".  It wasn't a horrible plate of fries, but no way in hell does it justify the $9.00 price tag.   There were actually fries left on the plate (That rarely happens!) when we were done!  I would not get them again.  Bumblebee-  This was a biscuit sandwich which came with chicken, mustard, honey and pickles.  The chicken was fried proper and tasted alright, but the portion was skimp and the texture of the chicken was just a bit \"off\".  The biscuit itself was incredibly large, but a bit dry.  I had a similar experience up in Portland at Pine State Biscuits.  Rave reviews, but when it came to the biscuit, the biscuit was sub par.  What's up with that?  It's your signature item, but unless you drown it with gravy/sauce/mustard/something else, the biscuit just isn't that great!   The pickles may have been the best part of the sandwich.  Lame, right?  I ate the whole thing, but was not truly satisfied.  For $10.00, I wouldn't buy it again.  Overall, not that impressed!  Service was friendly, and the joint is a cool little spot, but the food is just ok and the price is really expensive (IMO).  Once was enough and I highly doubt that I will be back.  There are just so many other places I would rather drop $20.00 at for a meal.  Exactly what 2 stars is...\"Meh...I've experienced better!\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Somewhere you can grab a bite in the evening or late night and the quality is always the best. Top notch people and top notch food."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE WELCOME DINER. Their food and drinks are amazing. They have one of the best hamburgers I have ever had and their Hurricane is ON POINT.  Love spending happy hour on their awesome patio :)"}
{"text":"Back when Welcome Diner was just burgers, hot dogs, and giant chocolate chip cookies served on greasy paper plates speckled with ants (or \"protein sprinkles\" as momma called 'em) it was simply a welcome diner. Now it's so much more than that.  Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.  My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of \"flare\" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.  Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.  TL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely. Bring an insatiable appetite and leave with a permasmile."}
{"text":"SO delicious. my husband and i stopped by last night for dinner (after months of talking about coming down). first of all, the place is adorable. it was not insanely hot last night (finally!), so we were excited to sit outside and enjoy some awesome food. i ordered the pulled jackfruit po'boy, my husband ordered the chicken parm special, and we shared a side of fries.  wow. just... awesome. as a vegetarian, it's sometimes a bummer to eat a veggie burger or vegetable sandwich over and over again. nothing makes me happier than to find a menu that has something really cool (and vegan) that i can eat. the po'boy was not easy to eat (my only gripe!), but i definitely did my best and ended up using a fork to scoop up the jackfruit that didn't make it in the sandwich. the bbq sauce is awesome, just the right amount of salty, sweet, spicy, and tangy. the coleslaw was fantastic as well, and the baguette it came on was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. so yummy.  my husband really liked the chicken parm, but can't wait to come back to try the bumblebee biscuit. the fries were also awesome, nice and crispy with a really yummy herbed aioli.  service was great. beer was local and delicious. food was wonderful. music was fun and super loud. all in all, definitely worth five stars."}
{"text":"What a positive experience, two for two. Ask for the Jack Fruit po-boy, you won't believe it. No it's not pulled pork it's pure veggie. The drinks are marvelous, they make their own ginger beer, it's not on the menu but ask for a dark and stormy."}
{"text":"Whhhhaaaat?! I have not reviewed these guys?! It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.]   The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]   They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good)   My favorites: Anything with their fried chicken.  Anything with their biscuits.  Their french fries are  hand cut and fabulous.  They smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board.  Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy).  Their salads are lovely and tasty.   They offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is SO rad. My crew and I were in town working an event and couldn't find anything open for dinner and drinks after 10pm. Found this place on yelp and was so so so happy about it. Looks like something you would find in Austin, TX. The no way jose was insane. The big Jim was heaven. Staff was awesome. American hipster vibe. Great music. I wish i could eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Welcome Diner was a welcome distraction in an otherwise very busy day. We had heard it was one of the best places to eat in Phoenix, and I can see why. Delicious, home style, southern food.   I ordered the bumblebee chicken biscuit sandwich. It was a little sweet for my taste, but that's understandable as honey is the star ingredient, but after some hot sauce all the flavors balanced out nicely.    My wife ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and she loved it. We also ordered poutine fries--I loved the gravy--and beignets for dessert.   Now I'm a little picky about my beignets, as I moved from Houston and visited NOLA often,  and these don't match up to Cafe Du Monde or other NOLA spots, but they were still finger licking good. Literally, the woman next to me was scraping the last of the honey out of her beignet bowl with her fingers and licking it off. And I could sympathize. I didn't want my meal to end after my last bite either.   The restaurant is very small. A handful of indoor seats and a small outdoor, community picnic style eating area. It took about fourty minutes for us to get our meal after we ordered, and that was with only 2 people in front of us at the order window. This felt like ages, but I forgot about all that when I took the first bite of my biscuit. We will be back. If you haven't been here yet, just go, so worth it!  Edit 2/26/16 Take out is definitely the way to do it!! Placed our order on the phone and was able to pick it up about 20 minutes later on a Friday night!!  The Champion Burger- Mmm, This is a tasty burger (Samuel L. Jackson Pulp Fiction voice).  If you're in the mood for a hamburger just order this!  You can't go wrong with The Champion Burger, it's a winner!!  The Mac & Cheese was yummy, adding Tomato Confit and Jalapeño Relish made it extravagant!"}
{"text":"Grew up in Canada and Poutine was a staple. This was different with southern gravy instead of brown gravy, but it works especially on their fries. Wed. has a happy hour featuring those same fries with pulled pork and a very special Cole slaw. Add a burger and a beer and you've got more than enough for two for dinner at under $25. This is serious food, done by m who really care about doing it right."}
{"text":"For those that haven't heard, Payton Curry has taken over Welcome Diner April through May on Sun, Mon, Tues, and First Fridays. Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.  The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!  You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!  We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.  The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :).   All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.  ps: It's BYOB!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Seriously a gem in the area. I was taken here last night and returned tonight because it was a no brainier. This is the perfect spot for a late date night. Great food and awesome drinks. I am a huge fan of the ginger beer(added it to a old fashion). They have a really awesome staff that really work hard. They have great customer service skills and seem to really like working there. All around this is a great business and I will be back many more times in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven past this place many a night on our way home from King's Convenience and it was always so full, we never thought to park the car and stroll on in. Last Friday night we got lucky and got a seat inside - yay! After enjoying the food from Welcome Chicken and Donuts on Broadway oh so much, I knew Welcome Diner wasn't going to disappoint. Our server, Taylor, was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about every dish and all of its ingredients - it's such a joy to see someone take pride in their work and I haven't even gotten to the food yet. We started off with the roasted brussell sprouts - yummy charred goodness plus it was a vegetable which buffered the other stuff I'm about to mention .... We both got chicken and biscuit masterpieces - The Bumblebee for me with its delicious pickles and honey mustard - all scratch made. My husband got the Big Jim - all I can say is \"wow\" - everything you could ever want in your life from the chicken, the bacon, the biscuit and the gravy. Oh, and did I mention their gorgeous, craft cocktails? They have those too. Now on to dessert - chocolate chunk. pecan. sea salt. pie - and believe me you get gorgeous chunks of everything in every bite! Their coffee is pretty darn fantastic too - from Piexoto in Chandler.  All in all, a damn perfect experience."}
{"text":"A unique spot with great food!  I had heard good things about Welcome Diner, so I was pretty pumped to try it out. Went with my wife for dinner on a cool evening, and we LOVED the feel and environment of the place! So cute and sweet. I love that they have unique comfort food, and aren't afraid of butter or red meat. I got the Big Jim Fried Chicken Biscuit, and it was seriously fantastic. I'm a big guy, and I couldn't even finish it, but every bite was awesome. Would definitely recommend going, and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had to update my review to share that I had dinner here last weekend for the final day of Arizona Cocktail Week. Of course, I couldn't pass up half priced hurricanes!  I tried the Vegan Po'boy (fried avocado, kale, pico de gallo and chipotle remoulade on french bread) and it was magical...but left me wondering how the heck do you fry avocados? No, seriously??? I'm sure google will tell me later which will lead to fun experiments in the kitchen....   Customer service is top notch--everyone that works here is super friendly and the wait time for food wasn't too shabby. I really love the vibe of this place and predict many visits in the future. Day or night, this place is one of the top restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was definitely a fun place to check out! It felt very unique and what I imagined to be representative of the community.  It was fun that all the seating was outside. I wasn't very interested in their drink options... but they did have a great selection of food items. I got the fish po'boy sandwich. The main problem I had with this was how much liquid came out. Once I picked it up a puddle soon developed on my plate and if I put my sandwich down it would get soggy. Well after holding it for a extended period of time with the juices running down my arms, and watching my husband eat all the fries, I finally put it down to grab a few. So then the bottom of my sandwich became extremely soggy. But the fish was still very good. And the sauce they gave us for the fries was also very good! I just wish their cups had been bigger."}
{"text":"Sort of a novelty, very unique, very small...this place does burgers and a quick lunch very well.  Not suggesting bring all your friends becaue the space is limited but for a quick bite to eat, this place is suitable."}
{"text":"If I was on death row and had one last meal... this would have to be it. Welcome Diner offers hands down the most hearty, homey, savory, authentic food in Phoenix. My favorites include the Big Jim (chicken biscuit w/ gravy + bacon) and the PB&B. But everything is great. Awesome atmosphere and employees, can't ask for anything more. If you like this place, try Welcome Chicken and Donuts!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue update. I don't think it gets much better than the Welcome diner. This place is legit delicious, I would struggle to find a meal I have had here that was sub par.... And I've been here many times (more than my check ins reflect). I try to bring people here as often as possible, family, friends... Because it is just that good. My favorite time to come is brunch..... One of the guys who works behind the counter gave me official credit for ordering the sunrise sandwich with egg over medium add tomato confit.... Add the confit... You will not be sorry. This thing is better than the lux egg sandwich (and if you know me, you know that's a big deal). The egg is always cooked perfectly, the biscuits are always buttery, flaky, and wonderful. The sandwich is the right mix of decadent and fresh.... Oh and if the husband gets the biscuits and gravy.... Put a little gravy on that sandwich and it's heavenly. Plus, they give you real cream for your coffee... Did you hear me? Heavy fricken cream!!! So good. Make sure you follow these guys on facebook for their beautiful daily specials that you wouldn't find in any other diner in the world (fresh made chicken and dumplings with butter poached chanterelle mushrooms for example). Have the pb and bacon burger... So yummy. Drinks? Forget about it, they are fantastic and happy hour has great specials. Sit inside the diner for great conversation and a bit of a show during your meal. Don't hesitate in trying this place out."}
{"text":"My party and I sat outside. The tables and dish ware were clean and the atmosphere was very fun and pleasant. The staff was kind and helpful. I had the Hurricane cocktail and it was phenomenal. I also had the Fire Bird and the beignets. The Fire Bird was good, but the beignets were amazing. My party also had the mac and cheese and grilled cheese, and they said they were delicious. Definitely coming back to try more. Love that they cater to the late night crowd; one of the few places."}
{"text":"Amazing.... had big Jim. Dope! The hurricanes are awesome too. Could have used little more rum.  Finished it off with beignets with honey and powder sugar...  I'm in coma now! :)"}
{"text":"I've never felt so compelled to use expletives in a review, but I feel like I could cuss up a storm and still not quite convey how much I'm digging Welcome Diner.   I've been here three times, twice in the past week, and I can't wait to go again. I had the holy puerco on my first visit, the big Jim on my second, and today I had the Carol with cheese, bacon, and egg added at the suggestion of the guy taking our order. Everything has been utterly impeccable. It's comfort food at its absolute finest. I can't wait to make it through their entire menu and I have absolute confidence that I'll find many more delicious gems just waiting to be devoured.   The atmosphere and location couldn't be any better either. Sitting outside on a nice wintry Phoenix day in Garfield will no doubt yield some good people watching and you'll be thankful to just be where you are.   In closing, I want to thank these folks for doing what they're doing. If you haven't been here yet, or if you're for some silly reason on the fence about giving it a shot, stop deliberating and get your tail over there. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I forgot to review this little diamond in the rough when I was there in August, but I LOVED it! Super fun atmosphere inside and out, deLUSCIOUS comfort food, and great drinks made by happy staff make this a sweet stop! I'm originally from Alabama. Let me tell you; I had the Fried Chicken Mac n Cheese, and it is Deep South approved!"}
{"text":"The ambiance at Welcome Diner is excellent for the location and neighborhood it is in.  Nestled on the Northwest corner of 10th St. and Roosevelt, it is a perfect fit for this Garfield gem!  The service is always great, consistent and on point.  I would call the overall genre of  the food to be southern, comfort food with a modern twist.  The standouts that I've tried thus far are the PB&B Burger and the Big Jim.  The handcrafted libations are all done very well and they are not shy with their pours!  It comes as no surprise to me that this business is thriving and growing!  All day happy hour on Tuesdays.  Check it out when you're in the hood or downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is next level and so is the service. Rob was awesome. That is all"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and one of the best burgers that I have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"I trekked all the way to this place from the Convention Center.  I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.  I got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.  Alongside my sandwich, I had a tasty Four Peaks stout."}
{"text":"Perfect hole in the wall Diner with awesome friendly service and some awesome soul food to back it up. everything on the menu is amazing! go see it and experiance it for yourself. it's truly unique."}
{"text":"There are some good things about this place and definitely some bad things. The poutine fries where really good. The fried chicken biscuit was good but only after I pulled the chicken out of it. The chicken itself was really tough and disgusting, luckily it slid out of the breading really easily. It would be nice if they used some sort of number system instead of screaming names every time they come outside with food or drinks, that would also eliminate the borderline awkwardness of the guy at the counter who asks for names. Last but not least of things I didn't like about this place which I know they cannot help is the other customers!!! One guy had an aggressive dog that almost bit some kid, there was another group of young 20 somethings that took out table even though we had full waters and napkins on it and there where 7 other open spots, then the other group on the other side of the family style table that was making some borderline offensive comments..... so needless to say after being around rude undesirable hipsters of all ages I probably won't be coming back. The staff was pretty friendly though and I really do love like 75% of their concept."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place is more funky cool than good food.  I went there for late happy hour with a friend.   The first thing to know is the inside seating is limited to the bar, maybe 6 seats.  You order outside and sit at patio tables.   The staff is super friendly.   The drinks are great.   Everything is expensive.  We ordered 2 hurricanes, poutine, brussel sprouts & mac & cheese appetizers  $42.00 plus feeding the tip jar.  The drinks were fantastic.  There was nothing good about the poutine; super skinny fries with 2 slices of cheddar cheese and a heap of lukewarm, flavorless,  really heavy sausage gravy.   Brussel sprouts were ok; roasted with what seemed like no seasoning.  Mac & cheese was a heavy glob without a lot of flavor.  Best advice, stick to the drinks."}
{"text":"The hubby was the one who read the reviews before choosing this place so I didn't really know what to expect. I knew we would be eating outside and the ambiance is really nice- backyard and picnicky. The food is more fancy and upscale. The Mac n cheese is thick and creamy. My daughter wasn't really into it. The brisket on the fries was really good and tender but I didn't care for their slaw.  Yelp mentions it is a good place for kids and maybe it is during the day. We are traveling and are way off our routine. We came around 10 at night with a 4 year old. Don't do that lol. (Don't judge , she was fine, just off a 3 hour \"nap\" with her daddy who is recovering from night shift Army stuff). Anyway, the crowd is young and language was vulgar from multiple tables.   It really is a nice little place to sit under the stars on a nice night, enjoy a drink or two with your SO or friends. The kiddos can skip this one."}
{"text":"Just get the Welcome Burger...I've had me a lot of burgers in Phoenix.  This one takes the cake!  Also, I recommend giving their homebrewed ginger beer a shot!  I promise you won't regret it.  I can't stop thinking about that burger!"}
{"text":"Unique dishes, with quality ingredients. Great laid back atmosphere. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Great people and amazing food.   A cute place with a great patio.   Indoor seating is very limited with only about 10 seats at the counter.   We had the fried green tomato sandwich and loaded Mac n cheese.   Food was exceptional.    We will return!"}
{"text":"Welcome diner is so cute and quirky. They have very limited indoor seating but have plenty of space on their patio. Try the mac'n'cheese or a burger. They also have a great selection of craft beer. It feels like you're at a picnic."}
{"text":"After years of being vacant, it's nice to see the Welcome Diner property revived. I'm impressed by the caliber of the menu that Michael has put together. And I love how there is Southern and Cajun style food. But even I couldn't have imagined something like the Holy Puerco--cheddar grit cake with cracklins and pulled pork. I also like the kale sandwich with the fried avocado. If you're getting the avocado, split it with a friend. Five pieces of that is a lot, in my opinion.  The biscuits are really unique. You can taste a difference from theirs and what you may get at another restaurant. The biscuit sandwich with the fried chicken and honey will hit just the right spot. I also like the biscuit with goat cheese and jam. And we can't forget about the peanut butter + bacon burger with fries. You may get some clogged arteries from sampling everything but it may just be worth it. I urge people to try this place. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Guy Fieri parachutes in.   I ended up writing about this place for an article on restaurants worth highlighting in Phoenix. Besides the food, I think this has a terrific location to build on being the \"Cheers\" of the Garfield neighborhood. The patio is really inviting and you can watch residents coming and going since it's in a residential area. It is quite hipster-dominated but that's just what a lot of Garfield and the Roosevelt Row area are. Hopefully there will be people to welcome this place for a long time to come."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this weekend and I'm so glad I did! I stumbled there with my bf after a house party in the neighborhood and we decided to eat and sober up before we left. I had the sunrise breakfast sandwich with sourdough (they were out of biscuits) and bacon mac & cheese. The sandwich was surprisingly really good without the biscuit I think I'll get it with bread everytime! The mac & cheese is heavenly!! The only gripe I had was that took a while for food to get to us. But I understand since we came right before closing they were a good amount people there already. So if you're ever drunk I'm the area and need some sobering up food I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Was my first time there...I loved it! ! I got the big jim I think..it was biscuits and gravy bacon and fried chicken! !! Mmmm delicious! ! Also ordered the hurricane drink during happy hour it was 6$ such a summer refreshing drink! !"}
{"text":"My 16 year-old son and I were already downtown and starving, so we decided to give WD a try. It was only 4:30 on a Friday, and they don't open until 5 pm, so we just cruised around the neighborhood for a little while to kill time. We walked up right as they opened (in fact, we were the first people there, other than a young lady ordering take out from the window). I wasn't sure how it all worked, not having been before, and didn't know that there is indoor seating, so we were prepared to sit at one of the tables out front. The cheery guy sticking his head out of the take-out window invited us in, to our relief (It was kind of chilly outside). We took the bar stools at the farthest end from the door. But with the music speaker directly behind our heads and in the path of a vigorously blowing fan, we weren't in the most comfortable spot. But before we could decide whether or not to move (I mean a couple of minutes!), every seat was taken and a long line of people was queuing up out front at the take-out window. So we stayed put and waited to order.  As I noted, we were the first people to arrive, so I was a tad annoyed that it took so long to place my drink order (two other customers' orders were  taken before mine, so I also had a bit of a wait for my Manhattan, which was delicious; still, the bartender needs to work on his speed of execution--I tended bar for several years, and besides not paying attention to taking orders in order of the customers' arrival, he was slow and a bit fumbly).  While we were sitting there waiting to order food, Mr. Cheerful came over to show us diners the evening's special: chicken and sausage gumbo. He explained that it had a southwest twist--nopalitas instead of okra, which makes sense, because getting fresh okra right now is not an option (which is why gumbo made in the winter traditionally includes filé powder--or if it's a seafood gumbo, roux. Nowadays, though, you're likely to find any combination of okra, filé, and/or roux. I was told that WD's gumbo just used a roux.). The little squares of nopalitas added a delicious flavor and texture, and if you didn't tell someone otherwise, they'd never guess they were eating cactus paddles.  Anyway, I was intrigued. I grew up in the South and have spent a fair amount of time in Louisiana, so I consider myself well-versed on this dish that I often make myself--although during this season of Lent, one is more apt to find gumbo z'erbes on home tables than the version with meat). Plus, I was freezing because of the fan, so a steaming bowl of gumbo sounded perfect.  And it was, although I had to ask for a spoon so I could eat it.  A  couple of dashes of  hot sauce,  and it was so, so good. I could've easily eaten a second serving! Speaking of seconds, my son loved his Little Birdy biscuit sandwich so much that when he finished it, he asked if he could have another. Hah! Well, it was that good. The biscuit is tender and crumbly (and huge), and we are a biscuit-crazy family, but the chicken was the real star. Seriously addictive stuff. We also ordered a bowl of the mac 'n cheese, which was a very generous portion of pasta drenched in a sauce containing a hint of smokiness (from smoked Gouda, I suspect). I found it a bit flat (underseasoned) and disappointing. The \"herbs\" seemed to amount to a sad sprinkling of chives that did nothing except add a dash of color, and the cheese sauce tasted more of bechamel than cheese. As my son commented, \"This can't hold a candle to your friend Bernie's mac and cheese at Citizen.\" Agreed. One more note about the dish: while it's definitely fun to watch someone in the tiny kitchen whip out a blow torch and pass it over a dish, it doesn't really add anything to this one (at least not ours). The result was a scattering of blackened spots across the top, rather than creating a bubbly, browned top. If there'd been a sprinkling of cheese to torch, then I'd see the point. But as it is? Nope.  We wound up taking most of it home, and I'll doctor the leftovers up myself. After we stuffed ourselves on dinner, my son unbelievably still had room for dessert. Of course, we ordered beignets. Ok, bear with this picky foodie for a second: these fried donuts served in a pool of really, really good honey and powdered sugar were delicious. But beignets? They looked like beignets. They smelled like beignets. But these little fried gems are dense rather than the slightly chewy, airy pillows I expected. I don't think they used a choux pastry or let it rise long enough.  In any case, don't expect real beignets and you'll happily enjoy them!  We look forward to returning to WD, although we plan to hit their sister joint Welcome CHICKEN + DONUTS first. I'll post something here when we do."}
{"text":"The food, service, and overall vibe of this place were fantastic. They had great ginger beer made in house and phenomenal chicken biscuits. Everything my group had was good and we left super stuffed."}
{"text":"DUDE. Gnarliest food. EVER. We stopped here on our way back from phoenix to California. Hubs had the carol, coleslaw, and fries and I had the watermelon,  tomato and arugula salad. OMG. Every BITE had flavor. Wayne. .is it wayne? Dude, I don't even know but he was super hospitable and welcoming and great all around. The food was out of this world.yum.dude. LOVE."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot near downtown the food is sooo good the atmosphere is so cool everyone there is super nice and did I mention the food? Their friend green tomato sandwich is To die for and their pulled pork fries are addicting!"}
{"text":"If you need a cheat day, take a cheat day here and get their Mac N Cheese! It is to die for!! All their food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time today and overall impressed. This is apparently their new location and it really nice. Good amount of indoor and outdoor seating and the decor is nice. The staff was friendly and the waiter, Marcus, was very informative about the menu. He recommended the burgers/sandwiches but since it was late was looking for a something a bit lighter so I ended up getting the jambalaya. My bf ordered the Big Jim which is a biscuit sandwich and he really enjoyed that. My jambalaya was ok, I was expecting something more runny. BUT what really blew me away and the reason I did 5 stars is their house made ginger beer!! SUPERB  I could sip on this all day. Next time, I will try their hamburger/sandwich since that's what they are more know for and skip the jambalaya. That ginger beer tho  can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! We were not aware there was an inside until halfway through our visit, but sitting outside under the misters was just fine!  I had the pulled pork fries and some poutine! Both were delicious!! The pulled pork has somes mustardy type sauce on it that is quite unusual but good!  The poutine is made with a white gravy and American cheese instead of the traditional brown gravy and cheese curds but very delicious and american dinerish.  Would definitely order again! I also had a hurricane, omg, sooo good! Loved it, really fruity and refreshing!!  My friend had the burger that he said was very good!! I look forward to going back and trying more things!"}
{"text":"Came here after an evening shift and loved it.  I didn't even know this place existed!  Such a cool idea... an old-fashioned diner serving late-night comfort food and cocktails.  It was super refreshing sitting outside in the air sipping a Paloma (grapefruit jarritos combined with tequila and some sort of juice) and munching on a side of fries.  Some of the other people in my group got biscuits, which looked incredible.  We hung out until closing-time, at which point a waiter wandered out to give us a few \"hey, closing soon\" friendly reminders.  We told him he should probably change the sign to \"UNwelcome diner\" at closing time every night.  He decided \"nah man, that's not our vibe.\"  Too funny.  Love the service.  This is definitely going to be one of my late-night post-shift haunts."}
{"text":"The welcome dinner was the first places my friend brought me. That was a few years ago and I went again recently. Still an amazing place.  It's a small kitchen, and very popular, so expect a bit of a wait. The seating is relaxed and inviting. The din of the eating area is perfect, as it is outside. Great place to come and lay back for awhile or before going into first Friday that is just down the street.   I suggest the ginger beer, it's house brewed and delicious! Any drink with it was not a let down (I had a few) I also had the honey biscuit sandwich and tried the free tomato also. Everything I've tried here is tasty."}
{"text":"Was delicious ! Big Jim, poutine fries,  beignets... now I need to try some more items!!"}
{"text":"Food took wayyyyyy too long. Takes forever to get food and is not worth it. Spend your late baker dollars at McDonald's"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Great flavorful food (sausage gravy is peppery and delicious). Drinks were perfect and atmosphere is casual. Perfect for kicking back on the porch and hanging with friends.  Daughter and I shared Mac and cheese (perfect, creamy, tangy) and the grilled cheese (minus the tomato confit). Intimate, unassuming location in a residential corner."}
{"text":"Bravo! This place aced it for me. I always like to read what people order at places to help me decide. I guarantee that anything you order here will be amazing and delicious. Great job guys!! Makes me happy to see a spot like this in Phoenix. Reminds me of Portland. Things are lookin up for the foodie scene."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Highly recommended for  community oriented, easy going individuals who also enjoy good a Americana meal."}
{"text":"What a perfect rescue for the social late night meal. My wife and I sat at the bar tonight and were greeted by Chadwick, a friendly bartender who offered us beer tastings and walked us through the menu in great detail. You could tell he really knew and loved the food they had to offer. The cocktail list was creative and had me wishing I had ordered one too! The poutine was the best I've ever had and we had this open-faced sandwich that I'm still dreaming about. Very friendly place, great vibes, and great atmosphere. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I would religiously talk about how great this place was....tonight june 13 was off!!! Our biscuits came out burnt....sent back...good brought back the sandwich was super salty....fries with gravy cold the cheese stuck it all together....tell the waiter he's says....it's you!!!!45.90bill for three biscuit chickens and it's me???!!!! What a bad experience and customer service was less than one star!!!! I'm sorry welcome back diner but me and my friends family won't be back#!!!!! Hire employees that actually care!"}
{"text":"This place is great atmosphere and delicious food!  Bring a coat in the fall/winter if you are eating outside because it can get fairly cold.  Also, if you go there on First Friday be expected to wait about an hour for you food.   The Blue Sky burger is off the chain."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, AND a great staff! Say whaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?    I had a brief, but torrid affair with the grilled cheese, and that delicious SOB left me wanting more!    I HIGHLY recommend this spot!!!"}
{"text":"Our daughter recommended this spot. And good thing she did, PERFECT BURGER! we will be back again and again.  Plus, it's a super charming, out of place, random, cool & hipster setting/location. Love!"}
{"text":"I am going to hold total  judgement on this hippy hangout but be warned: check the prices BEFORE you go.  Two tiny  biscuit orders and gravy fries will set you back $30 and then add a drink with tip and tax you will be out $40.  I mean really.  Nice  place for skinny females who eat like a bird but if you are a construction worker who wolfs down 3 Big Macks, fries, and jumbo  soda at the burger stand, eating like that here will cost you a weeks pay."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews,  but this needed one. There used to be a vegan ace in LA called pure luck. Had this bbq jackfruit sandwich that I loved. It went out of business a while ago and I haven't found one like it since. Until last night. That jackfruit po'boy was amazing. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. My hat is off.  Honestly, might even be worth a drive from la, just for the sandwich."}
{"text":"I live a couple blocks from this place and I would literally eat here every day if I could afford to.  Though I'd probably end up with a few extra pounds to go with my empty bank account.  But every day when they post their daily special up on their Facebook page, I just sit and drool over it.  I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good.  Its comfort food at its best.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They treat you like a regular even if its your first time.  I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors.  I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain.  And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday).  This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people.  I hope this place is around for a very long time."}
{"text":"Cool place! Great vibe and nice people working there! Ginger beer was REALLY good! Will be coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a graduation and my daughter found this place on yelp and I'm glad she did. The atmosphere was great and the food was excellent. Best time I had in Phoenix"}
{"text":"PB&B was surprisingly delicious! I would have never thought peanut butter on a burger would be delicious, but it's super tasty!! Their fries are crispy and taste like real potato. The second generation cocktail is really good and I can drink those all day!"}
{"text":"Great food at OK prices, with a laid-back al fresco slash in-your-own-backyard set up. Even during the peak of summer, the outdoor misters make it a comfy spot to grub and hang.   Only reason why I'm not giving it another star is because the two very separate occasions that I phoned in a pick-up order, this girl would take my order - and I don't know if it's just how her voice sounds (???) - but she just makes you feel like you shouldn't be asking questions. Mega rude, that one."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE MAN.   Such a unique menu and drink selection.   The vibes are strong. I got the PB and B Burger and it was heavenly. I also tried my buddy's biscuit with chicken and gravy and that was divine.   This is a great place to hang with friends and eat delicious food.   BB's Rating: Rooseveltastic!"}
{"text":"The stars are really for the location, set up and atmosphere. The seating is first come first serve which isn't a lot, they have 3 massive tables that can be shared unless a huge party is there and just sit to chat for a couple of hours. Seemed as though the kitchen was understaffed, took forever for our food. The menu is super small, burgers, salads and every which way for biscuits and gravy. The burger was okay, it was a burger. It wasn't special or even that flavorful. I ordered a side of Brussels instead of fries (I know, who does that) after a long wait they bring out burger & fries, we tell the server and he takes my entire plate, brings back just the burger. 5 minutes later the Brussels come out. They were black. Fully burned.  If I returned it would be to take up seating, wasn't impressed by the food or the fact they take your whole plate back just to return the one piece. Did they reuse the fries?"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. Burger is on point. It's outside and you will probably have to wait a little bit, but trust me, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I go to Welcome Diner so much at this point, I feel like making up disguises. It's like, c'mon, I'm JUST trying eat here everyday of my life and not feel embarrassed about it.   The thing is, they make the best everything I've ever had anywhere.  The Bleu Burger? Omg. The Peanut Butter Bacon Burger? Literally so good, I'm pretty sure I lost IQ points. The Biscuit Sandwiches? I want to be in a Facebook-official relationship with one.  Just go here - you will understand and you will not regret it. Actually, you might regret it, because you tend to go.. no where else afterwards. Just start trying your disguises on now.  Real complaint: They only do breakfast on weekends, doesn't start till 10:30am. More real complaint: They won't let me move in."}
{"text":"You know that place you always say you want to go to, but never get around to actually going? Welcome Diner was that place for me. Someone would mention it and, mentally, I'd make a note to make it over there but that swiftly slipped my mind. Until recently, when my buddy Paul wanted to get out for dinner. And enter Welcome Diner.  The weather was great for our meal, maybe a little chilly. Paul ordered the fish po'boy and a side of poutine (the latter we shared), I ordered the Garfield (which was previously on the menu, then taken off, because it was announced on the board as such) with an over-easy egg. The spicy fried kale was fantastic. However, eating this as a sandwich was messy--I had yolk and juices dripping which resulted in me licking my hands and arms like the dog in the corner. There was a dog in the corner; we were on the patio. So, I took the top biscuit off and finished it with a fork and knife.   Paul said he enjoyed the po'boy, but we both agreed what they called poutine wasn't poutine. It was fries with shredded cheese melted over it and white gravy. Not bad, really, but not the poutine we've had.  So now that I've *finally* made it here, I know now I'll be back again and again. Thx, Paul!"}
{"text":"Quaint little diner - a great example of kitschy 50s Americana. It's the sort of thing 5 & Diner tries to be, only more authentic. The menu is very simple and it's nothing you couldn't get elsewhere, but the food is very good. You didn't really come here for the food though, did you... no, you came here for the atmosphere...  I went during the summer and it was pretty hot inside the little box. There were some fans working overtime to help compensate, but with the cramped quarters, the dining area is pretty close to the stove.   You can tell that for the people that own and operate this joint, it's definitely a labor of love. It's such a warm and inviting place to go. I can see eating here once in awhile for the experience, but it's not the kind of place I could see myself eating regularly... maybe it's because I don't live in the neighborhood. People in walking distance would definitely become addicted to the place.   I really enjoyed the food here. There were funny little books available for us to read and there was a notebook where customers could draw in. The whole thing was something I'll always remember... fondly. You owe it to yourself to at least check this place out once."}
{"text":"I met my friend here for dinner and hadn't really head of this place even though I don't work too far away from the Garfield location. To be honest I'm not too keen on eating outdoors, especially when it's so hot outside. They do have limited seating inside but they were all occupied.  It took me a while to decide what I wanted to try and I ended up selecting the jambalaya. This version did not have shrimp, which is something I can eat my weight in, but it was still excellent. The portion was larger than it appeared and I didn't even come close to finishing it.  When I got there, there was maybe one other customer outside. After the sun set, this place was very busy. In fact, I've never seen a crowd like this. This place must be extremely popular.  I'd like to go back, but I think I'll wait until the summer heat subsides a bit."}
{"text":"The place is...quirky (hipster?) And it's mostly outside so remember that in the summer! Everyone we talked to was really nice and the food was great. You can tell they really put passion into the food, even if they're just making you a biscuit sandwich (the guy even pointed out how he hand-made everything on the plate).    A good place to hang when the weather is cooler but I wouldn't take a girl there on a first date."}
{"text":"The biscuits are delicious and made for giants. Like always Welcome Diner kills it again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm in AZ. I travel all over the west and this place makes me smile every time. Great local food and the Beers are always legit. A must visit !  Cheers."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great \"comfort food.\" It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)  This places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.  I tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh. Descent beef portion too. It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection.   I will definitely be returning. There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I'd like to try. A place with a cool, hipster vibe to it and the food, service, and unique menu are outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Super cool, eclectic, very old diner from the 1940's. I did not like the burger I got but to be fair I knew it was just me and not them. I got the PB Burger which I am guessing is an acquired taste that I have not yet acquired. Ha! So I wiped off the PB and devoured all the ingredients separately for this review. I was pretty happy with the results. All the ingredients were delish. The burger juicy and tasty. For some reason I was nuts about their pickles. lol. I love pickles but these were extra wonderful to me. I also liked their Brussel Sprouts. Super cool and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Airbnb did not disappoint. This spot was down the street from the spot I rented and oh man, bombest food in town. Their Champion burger with Mac and cheese was pretty dank. Probably the best burger and Mac and cheese I've had. Also their braised pork with fries was good too. I'm definitely coming back to this spot every time I'm in Phoenix! On top of that, their crew here are pretty entertaining. Pretty hip spot!"}
{"text":"Simply said delicious chicken, I'm in love with their mac n cheese, the biscuits make the sandwiches awesome, I'm going to work my way through the entire menu, it all sounds great eats"}
{"text":"Yeah... the Green Fried Tomato Sandwich was amazing. Never had anything like this before. The corn relish was delicious and the tomato is breaded and then fried. Too good."}
