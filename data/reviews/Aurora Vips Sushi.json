{"text":"We've always enjoyed the food at VIP Sushi (though we can't get over the name \"VIP\"--sounds like an adult-only type of place, if you know what I mean), but were disappointed to see it boarded up and some major construction going on at the site. Not sure if it has been closed permanently or just a major renovation?"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times now and I tells ya they do it up right. Very accommodating and always going the extra mile making you feel like a real VIP lol"}
{"text":"I was hopeful when I tried this place for the first time today as the only other review at the time gave it a 5 star review.  The food was definately worthy of 4 stars and the service was prompt and pleasant.  So why 3 stars?  This is clearly a family run restaurant from the children running around barefoot and the toys all over the place.  The waitress had children hanging off her legs as she took our order and we ate to the sounds of children yelling and screaming.  For premium price sushi I expect a dining experience that reflects the cost.  If you want truly excellent sushi with a special dining experience, mi me sushi is easily the best in aurora, go there instead."}
{"text":"It was a great place.  Probably the best sushi in Aurora.  Alas, it's now closed :("}
