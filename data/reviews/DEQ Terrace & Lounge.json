{"text":"This review is for the outdoor terrace.  We ordered drinks only as we had already eaten.  We probably would have ordered another round had the pigeons not been there.  They were disgusting - walking across the tables and chairs!  One even flew right at my husband.  Another one flew right at a woman sitting at an adjacent table and the waitress came over to try and get it to fly away.  The patio is so nice and ruined by these pigeons.  I can't believe a place as nice as the Ritz wouldn't find a way to get these birds out of the eating space of their guests.  I have never seen this at any other patio in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the service from the staff. They always make me delicious cocktails. Beautiful patio! My favourite place to unwind after a long week."}
{"text":"Best afternoon tea service! So attentive and delicious! Trust me, I routinely have tea a few times a month and this has been the best by far! 

Wasn't a huge fan of their sweets but I've always been more of a savoury fan."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! It's my personal top choice for afternoon tea. The service is fantastic. The servers are always very friendly and helpful yet not overly \"caring\". The sandwiches are so good and I particularly love the quiche! Only one drawback is that the desserts are a bit too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Even though I wasn't staying in the hotel I dropped by DEQ a number of times during TIFF 2014. Love the atmosphere, the attentive staff/servers, and the menu was tasteful and surprisingly affordable. The deck is a great place for a drink and to just hang out. If I'm in Toronto again I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere, excellent food (one of the best high tea food services I've experienced), but tea service itself could be improved.

Ambience
The DEQ terrace and lounge is a very spacious and cozy lounge area.  One of my pet peeves at certain high tea locations is being right in the middle of lobby foot traffic, and being peered at as people walk by.  This won't happen at DEQ.  Comfortable chairs, cozy fireplace, good natural light.  IMO, this is the best ambience for high tea in Toronto.

Food
I was super impressed.  First of all, quantity-wise, you can plenty.  The food arrived in three rounds:  1) warm mini quiche; 2) an assortment of savoury sandwiches; 3) an assortment of sweets.  We did not have to eat dinner after!  I was also impressed by the quality of the food.  Everything was delicately and distinctively prepared (e..g the mini sandwiches each had its own type of bread and filling, as opposed to the same piece of white bread used with three different fillings).  The food really was top-notch.

Tea
My only complaint is how the tea was served.  I was kind of surprised we were each served our tea with a 1L teapot.  That is a lot of tea for one person, and hard to drink all of it before it falls below the ideal temperature.  Also, we were not given a plate to set the tea leaves aside...so I think the expectation is that your tea will continue steeping for the entire time you are trying to finish that pot of tea.  My tea ended up being too strong.  My understanding is that no tea should be steeped indefinitely, but maybe I am wrong?  It would be nicer if they just served the tea in a small pot, so that the water can be changed more frequently.  Or, provide a way to set the tea leaves aside so that it doesn't steep indefinitely.  

Overall, despite the little issue about the tea, I highly recommend DEQ.  Without a doubt, this is one of the best high tea experiences I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Beware of dishonest service. My wife and I went for afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday and were very disappointed by unethical business practices, spoiling an otherwise pleasant time. 

The server approached us and told us we had the option of 3 complimentary drinks: Prosecco, rosé and champagne. I initially said we didn't want alcohol, thinking there would be added costs, but my wife heard her say complimentary and asked her to clarify. She said 'yes, the drinks are complimentary'. So we ordered champagne. At no time did she reference the menu or the titles of the 3 options (classic tea, blush tea and royal tea). She simply asked our preference for a choice of 3 complimentary drinks. 

And so...the bill arrives to the tune of $179, about $50 more than we had expected to pay. I thought we had misheard and was willing to let it go, but my wife wanted to speak to our server. The server explained that the drinks choices were complimentary, but that the choice of champagne meant we had selected a more expensive option. We tried to explain to the server that's not what complimentary and she only responded by showing us the menu, which read: 

Classic Tea 54
Assortment of savoury and sweet delights
Selection of fine tea
Glass of Nua Prosecco

Blush Tea 58
Assortment of savory and sweet delights
Selection of fine tea
Glass of Henry of Pelham, \"Cuvée Catherine\"

Royal Tea 69
Assortment of savory and sweet delights
Selection of fine tea
Glass of Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne

Of course you can see, each option is identical, except for the drink and the drink is what causes the price to increase. This is not what complimentary means, as the drink is in fact the only factor available that increases price. The server refused to budge on our concerns and only said 'I'm sorry for the confusion'. But her explanation showed she didn't think she had done anything wrong and that we were to blame. To boot, gratuity was automatically included at 15% so we couldn't leave a smaller tip.

As for the meal, the tea and desserts were excellent, the sandwiches average, and the service was otherwise attentive and thoughtful. Our other server Ali was very friendly and welcoming and they did add nice birthday touches of balloons and a birthday dessert."}
{"text":"Great for celebrating a special event with your favourite person. A very elegant affair with plenty of food to satisfy all ages.

Make a reservation in advance. You will need to complete a form (with your credit card information) to confirm. 

Don't be embarrassed to ask for your treats to-go if you can't finish them. They will pack it up for you, no problem."}
{"text":"Excellent lounge atmosphere and service, not to mention location/view of CN Tower. Drinks carefully made and delightful wine/beer offerings. Spiced nuts and olives were perfect cocktail accompaniments and evened out the price of the drinks. I hoped to go to tea on the weekend but it was booked - I can see why!"}
{"text":"Had a late night snack and drink there last night. Food was delicious, cocktails were really good. However, go there after a Leafs game and you'll definitely encounter some disgusting, uncivilized ill mannered men. The bartenders and waiters should definitely do something when inconsiderate individuals bother other customers with rude remarks and actions. I expected a lot more from the ritz. I would have never experienced this at the ritz in New York! Customer service = horrible."}
{"text":"Came here with some decent expectations for dessert but left a little disappointed. The ritz chocolate cake was good but I ordered caramel ice cream with it but what came out was vanilla with only a little caramel drizzled on it that you could barely taste. Also had the tres leches cake which was just a soggy mess that was tasteless & the strawberries and cream was pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"Came here for the afternoon tea. I've been to just about every hotel in this city for tea. This was my least favourite. The food was ok. I liked that they had samplers so you could smell the tea leaves before making a selection. The Alice in Wonderland theme was tacky and childish. The service left a lot to be desired from the time of reservation right down to receiving the bill. Any questions about how this could be is immediately eradicated upon seeing the bill and the gratuity that has been already tacked on. Why offer good service when you receive the same gratuity regardless. Took a lot of back and forth to get the reservation in the first place and then was left disappointed. Next year it will be back to one of the better places like Royal York, King Edward or Shangri La."}
{"text":"** Please note that I posted this review under \"Ritz Carlton\" as well. 

Ritz Carlton is obviously synonymous with luxury, and it does not disappoint. Luckily, a close friend is a manager at the Ritz, so my friends and I got a tour of the facilities. The rooms are spectacular. So comfortable and luxurious with bright bathrooms and all of the special touches that makes this a five star experience. The two suites we visited had unbelievable tower views. There is a yoga studio with a full schedule of classes, and a gym with top of the line equipment.

The best part of the evening was lounging on the patio at DEQ. It is incredible. The seating is super comfortable and the space very well designed. What really impressed me was the food. The menu changes frequently, but it is high end, more casual, intelligent and seasonally inspired financial district fare. (Think Bymark) However, it was far better than any of the other lounges I have been to in Toronto. We had a Flat bread with Morales and Chevre noir, with shaved asparagus and cauliflower purée that was the star of the evening for me.  My girlfriends were losing it over the poutine which had a hint of apple jus. The onion rings were fantastic, and we spit a pana cotta for dessert. All memorable.

Large enough wine selection, at fairly reasonable prices considering the environment. We had a bottle of Malbac that was good, fairly priced and served in gorgeous glassware. There is a full Charcuterie station if that is your thing, complete with made-in-house preserves.

Fantastic service. My evening at DEQ deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Review for Afternoon Tea (November 2014)

This review is long overdue, but I needed to stress this is not a place to go if you want high end tea service.

My group expected great service and amazing food because of the location inside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, but was very disappointed as it failed to deliver for a reputable luxury establishment.

The decor was very modern and relaxed, like you were at a friend's livingroom which was nice.  Plus they even had a lovely fireplace in the main room.  Service  was friendly, but was very slow  despite not being very  busy and at times service was non-existent.   We were waiting for a friend who was late for our 2pm reservation, but in the end couldn't make it after we waited for 35-40 minutes.

During the wait, the server didn't offer us the tea selection, but only water.  And then, to our surprise the server said they had to charge the amount for our friend not showing up because they had \"pre-made\" the food. 

The tea selections from Sloan Fine Tea Merchants was displayed in a nice wooden box and the server explained the various popular teas, then left for about 10 minutes before returning to take our tea selections.  To our dismay, the tea took another 20-25 minutes to be served to us.  

The mini quiches came out before our teas and what a disappointment because it was not even served lukewarm, but we were all very hungry and just ate it as is. 

Next was the savoury selection which was presented nicely on a unique tiered serving display, but we were very disappointed with all the sandwiches.  There was definitely a good selection of  assorted sandwiches, but all the bread was crusty and stale tasting, plus all the fillings and toppings were bland tasting. We were all hungry so just ate the sandwiches, but not all of us finished every sandwich.  

When the server said pre-made, when exactly was it made?  Even if it was the morning or night before the bread shouldn't have been this crunchy.  Even the 5 year old in our party said it was awful and didn't finish her portion.  She had the classic tea selection like the rest of us which was served on an individual platter for her. 

The sweet selection was a lot better as it was tasty and had a great variety of different pastries and mini desserts.  The sweets were not overly sweet that you had to take several sips of tea.  For the most part the sweets were definitely more enjoyable than the savoury selection. Bonus for the unique display than the ordinary tiered platter service.

The scones were edible to our surprise because it was fluffy and buttery in texture.  We wondered if this was even made in house or bought at the local bakery.  Jams and clotted cream that accompanied the scones were a delight and enhanced the flavour of the scones.

During the tea service, I had to ask the server for a hot water refill for the teapot which was complied, but the rest of my party were not asked if they needed a hot water refill. The server left rather quickly before we can even tell her, but we definitely asked when she returned.

For tea service this was highly unacceptable to our liking because the whole premise of afternoon tea is actually having tea readily available.  I guess we were used to other afternoon tea services where the servers automatically comes with hot water to refill the teapots or at least offer if we needed more hot water on several occasions. 

Overall, it was definitely not a very enjoyable afternoon tea experience, so my advice is save the $40 and go elsewhere.  Many other places in the area that offers better afternoon tea service.

Note:  The server was definitely quick to produce the bill when we asked for it."}
{"text":"Came down to Deq for lunch on Friday.  I like upper tier dining but this place was referred to us as having casual food; until we found out it was fancy shmancy not so great casual fare.    Deq is a very  Nice space to sit and lounge with good company and gets a 5 out 5 for ambiance and service.  Can't say the same about the food.  The very friendly waitress overhyped a feature of water melon salad, which turned out to be a rectangular ceramic olive dish lined with a checker board layout of white wine dipped melon cubes, feta cube and olive; not a salad but 4 rows of each ingredient randomly placed on the plate; nothing salady or special, really.   We had a cheese plate that has 6 croutons and 3 kinds of mini cheese portions with a table spoon fig jam, not great but ok for sharing; the portion is skimpy so you will need two orders I you are a party of four.   The best item on the meninges actually their cheapest offering for a light entree:  chicken flatbread with artichokes and mozzarella fillings, well done.  So come down for drinks and have lunch or dinner before arriving. Lunch for two with water and Diet Pepsi was a steep $74+tx and gratuity so not good value for the combination of ambiance and experience."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets in terms of patio lounge setting in Toronto, and for me, in Canada.  So it fully deserves the three stars that I'm rendering it.

This is a continuation from my TOCA dining experience, so go read that if you find this review lacking in crutial detail for it to make sense.

It was an unusually warm evening, so after our dinner upstairs at TOCA, Myself, Claire, Lucia and everyone else descended to DEQ, where I was earlier in the evening mentally preparing for dinner.  
We picked a spot at the terrace in front of the fireplace, and ordered ourselves some cocktails and ice wine from the same sommelier at the restaurant, only this time there was two of them, and they were both 6'5, making me my 6'1 ego feel uncomfortably around the five foot range.  Serious, how high are the racks at the Ritz?  DO they scout wine connoisseurs from NBA tryouts? 

The indoor decor was gorgeous, with seating for a dozen people, to just a table for one.  That is amazing and very considerate.  The ground floor terrace is enclosed within the hotel, and gave a private ambiance for an outdoor setting, which is remarkably in shortage in this city.  The ice wine I ordered wasn't available, which meant I was given the same bottle from an earlier year, and I was VERY happy about that.  That was probably a savings of a hundred dollars. 

We were the only people out at the terrace, and so we were able to talk as loud as a bunch of Mainland Chinese people were capable of talking, our waitresses was a lovely girl who forgot the details of my orders twice.  I asked for two cubes of ice in my red bull & vodka, the first time she give me like a dozen cubes of ice, the second time she gave me no ice.  I'll forgive her because her heels were so high, and I was so drunk. 

So why three stars?  Because The Ritz is an international name, and based on international standards, it's at best a three star venue.  Toronto seems to be an excuse to not make things extravagant.  The fear of people thinking someone else is pretentious had rendered this town into a melting pot of self deprecating, humility loving Janes & Joes....and it certainly reflect in our architecture. 

I imagine a four hour evening of partying for a dozen people would cost up to around $1200, which is very reasonable for the ambiance, service, and clientele."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to come to DEQ for after-work drinks. All of us had heard great things about this bar and were very excited to try it out. Some FYI's before the review begins:

1. There is another bar (Toca) which is right near the entrance, but you will immediately see that it is not as cozy nor intimate as DEQ and is substantially smaller (almost situated in some corner room).
2. To get to DEQ, walk straight past the entrance. Outdoor patio seating is very hard to come by and there are no reservations allowed, except for weekend tea service. When you arrive, you can tell the bar hostess you would like to be put on a waiting list for outdoor tables.  

Intro. This was my first time at the Ritz and already I am very impressed. I will have to agree with Jennifer M. on many things, including the STELLAR service. I had my door opened by the doorman with a smile and I was led by a hostess to where DEQ was. Then, the DEQ hostess, who immediately greeted me regretted to inform that there was a 10 table waiting list for outdoor patio, but I could choose a very comfortable booth chair for privacy. Total LOVE for the Ritz. 

Food. I unfortunately came here hungry so the menu is definitely not for dinner, but rather, plates for sharing. The greedy eater I was, I ordered two plates that would normally count for sharing all for myself *shame*: The Cheese Boutique and the Salmon Salad. Both were great and our wonderful server explained everything in detail. My other girl friends had flat breads and both said were absolutely delicious. 

I am a champagne girl so I had my Veuve, but the wine list carries a broad selection of whites and reds and at a reasonable price. Towards the end the night, I felt something sweet like a Moscato and asked our server if they had a good one she could suggest. She then brought out a lovely Moscato d'Asti (lightly frizzante which is the best way to end your meal) and even gave me the option of sampling before she poured a full glass. 

It bears to mention again that the service was great, great, andddd great. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about wine and food (none of this I don't know followed by awkward stare and silence). Service was never intrusive but every time my friends or I wanted to order, it was as if she could read our minds and there she was!!! Then, a gentleman in suit (the head manager of the bar?) came over to thank us as we were paying our bill and to say that he looked forward to having us again.

Ambiance. DEQ bar is very cozy. They have a fireplace with love chairs and at the other end of the room, tables for two and four. Although we could not sit outside, the patio is very nice and large. Definitely coming back (earlier) to try and snag a coveted patio seat. Guests inside the bar were a mix of young and old. Hard to explain; Not a snobby crowd, but guests who clearly had money to order glasses and glasses of champagne. Understated elegance.

I already have plans to come back to DEQ with my mom soon. We want to try out the spa so will do a spa and lunch date - stay tuned for that review. All in all, DEQ is a wonderful change to the bar scene. The management for the Ritz Toronto location have done a superb job in training staff to deliver the Ritz brand of service. If you have time to pop by for drinks before or after any engagement, let DEQ be your next destination. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever! Since Ritz Carlton is known for their excellent customer service,  I am shocked that Ritz Carlton will be affiliated with DQZ Terrance and Lounge. I have been to other high tea cafe by Ritz Carlton and never got that kind of service. When we arrived, it took a while for someone to greet us, They sat us down on a cozy couch setting. No one came to greet us, or acknowledge us and we were seated against a wall, so it was hard to get the server's attention. Eventually my party decided to switch seat setting since it will be hard to dine, sitting on the couch. I had to walked over and find a server to ask if there was any tables available. They came back 10 mins later and told us there was and we have to wait 15mins. (I didn't get it, because didn't the tea service just started and it wasn't like they have to clean up a table, everything was already clean) While we were waiting, a server finally came over and introduced the tea service and menu. We finally got seated to our new table and we were just waiting there. We saw other tables were already eating on the finger foods and no one came to introduced the teas. After another 15mins, the server came with the tea box and let us pick out of tea. The food was also terrible, the Quiche was overcooked and one of my party mention, they were surprised it was just eggs and nothing else was in there.  No one came over to ask how was the food. They would just come over and grab our empty plate, seem like they were rushing us, as other servers started to set out candles for dinner service. We had to get someone attention for our bill and as our server who was gone all night came back with the bill and then ask us how was the food. It's so ridiculous how bad their service was and I was absolutely embarrassed because I was the one who recommended this place for my friend's birthday. We're all not coming back here ever again. If you want to waste your money for being ignored then be my guest. Another side note, I understand if the tea service was a full house but the place was only 1/3 fill with guests, I can't even imagine if they are busy and how long we will have to wait."}
{"text":"Awesome place to catch up with a friend. Great food and tea quality.
Read my full review on http://www.fromwhereim.com/deq-ritz-carlton/"}
{"text":"Went with 2 of my girlfriends to catch up on a sunny Sunday afternoon. While the sun was out it had started to  get a bit chilly so we didn't get to sit out on the patio. However, it looked really inviting and would definitely go back next summer to enjoy that.

To be honest nothing here was really memorable. Food was delish and dessert were up to expectation for an establishment like this. Only issue was that the creme brulee had way too much alcohol. I think all 3 of us spat it out in unison on our first bite as it was so incredibly strong. (Thank god R.I.D.E. was not parked out).

Ambience and decor is really nice and staff is not too stuffy.

The tea however was phenomenal. I ABSOLUTELY loved the jasmine green tea. I'm a big fan of this kind to begin with yet it is extremely rare to find genuine jasmine smelling green tea as authentic as you find in Asia but well done Ritz! The Earl Grey was fantastic as well. Our least favorite was the one that the staff usually recommends (I forgot name but a fusion of some sort).

Will be back!"}
{"text":"A great place for a quiet drink and some delicious food. The patio in the back is incredible but a little too crowded and busy for me. I prefer to be inside.

First the GOOD:

- Incredible consistent service. Never had a problem on multiple visits. Love that they use your first name. Easily 5 star on the service.... I feel like a VP every time.

- Nice dark calming atmosphere / decor. Great after a busy day at work. Ask to sit by the fireplace on a cold winter day. 

- If your there just for drinks, they provide complimentary kettle chips.

- Gnocchi is excellent... pasta heaven. Priced comparable to a good Italian restaurant at $18.

- I always get the beet salad when they have it. Lighter but packs a flavour punch. Pumpkin seeds on top are a welcomed addition ($18). The watermelon summer salad is also excellent. 

- If you just want a snack to share, go with the flat bread pizza's. 

- Interesting & unique cocktail selections (but please get more beers on tap).

- Beautiful washrooms

and the NOT so Good:

- Only two beers on tap (Mill str. Organic & Mad Tom IPA). They also have 7-8 in bottle.

- Beer is a little pricier compared to my other favourite hotel lounge - The Library Bar at the Royal York. Pints are $10 - $11. 


Highly recommend. The service and ambiance will always bring me back despite the limited beer selection.

Its definitely ONCE in a lifetime experience. 
The staffs are definitely nice though."}
{"text":"Deq is my favourite place to go to on Thursday or Friday for drinks. Great atmosphere and service is always impeccable. It's also one of my favourite spots for meetings and client lunches during weekdays. The menu is decent but perhaps they should get their banquet exec chef Raghu to redesign the menu for them (he's recently created this fusion menu that looks superb).  More than anything else, I like the atmosphere here and the magnificent patio."}
{"text":"Would really give this a 3.5 star. Was expecting a spectacular experience but I am unimpressed with the high tea selection of sandwiches and desserts here. At this price point I would recommend going to Fairmount for high tea which provides a better value. It was nice to try this place but I wouldn't come back here again. 

Value 2/5 - $70 inclusive of tips and tax for your own pot of tea, variety of finger sandwiches and desserts in Alice in wonderland theme. $55 plus tips and tax. 

Service 5/5 - Their service is excellent and the staff who work here are extremely professional and knowledgeable. 
 They were very prompt in seating me and my two girlfriends and offered our drinks right away. It took a while for them to ask us for our tea preferences. I would recommend allot of 2 hours for high-tea here. 

Quality 3/5 - The options for sandwiches were not as unique as I would imagined it would be. 

Ambience 4/5 - While I quite admire the interiors of the Ritz Carlton, I think the interiors of DEQ are a bit dark and traditionally dated. The chairs are alright and the selection of decor was not overly impressive. The serving plates and utensils were also not overly impressive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite.

We were told to sit anywhere, but none of the vacant tables were clean and no one seemed to be doing anything about it.  

The table we finally got had gum stuck under it.

Food was decent - All fries should come with truffle oil!"}
{"text":"I came in here with a party of 8 on a Friday night at around 9:30pm and it was pretty crowded. Deq does not have a large space and they do not take reservations so I was very worried that we would not find a place for ourselves being that late. 
At first the 2 areas of the lounge that could have accomodated us were both filled up, while debating if we would stick to sitting at the bar or going somewhere else, one of those 2 spots (luckily the spot I really wanted) opened up and we grabbed it and I'm sure glad we did! 
Our spot was right in front of the fire place and consisted of 2 long couches facing each other with a table in between.

They do have a \"terrace\" portion outside which could significantly increase their capacity in warmer weather, so I will like to come and visit then. 

My largest concern was how much this evening would cost us since they only have their food pricing online and the other bar at the hotel prices drinks at $8 and $16, so it could have racked up quite a bit.
I was so relieved to glance at their wine list and see that they had a few bottles going for $30 - $50 which is not crazy at all and so we all went ahead and splurged on a few (local) bottles of wine, those of us that stuck to vodka/whiskey drinks had all their drinks under $10. We also went ahead and ordered a couple of their prosciutto flatbbread, which was salty heaveness and comes cut in to pieces of 6, perfect for a 3 person share and while it should be cheaper, it's not too hard on the wallet at $14.

Our waitress was very friendly and never gone for too long. The place definitely filled up by around 10 or 10:30pm, and it was a very relaxing atmosphere, it's just what I was hoping for, no crazy loud music, comfortable seating, great food and drink, great for a group or couple to have some solid time together. 
A drink menu in addition to the wine list would not be a bad idea though."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Ritz Carlton and decided to grab a drink before bed so I can't speak to the food, but the drinks were delicious. And they should have been for $20 a pop, even high by Toronto standards. That being said, it was very trendy with a great outdoor space that was very live. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for nutcracker holiday tea time in December 2015 and really enjoyed the ambiance. It feels like Christmas when you walk in to the lobby smelling of gingerbread, servers dressed as nutcracker characters, and festive decked around the restaurant. 

The service was superb, and food is better than the average available in Toronto. Although pricier than other tea options, hey, sometimes it's nice to enjoy an experience with a bubbly in hand."}
{"text":"Came here right a Jays game ended and was brought in by the fact we could get a terrace seat. Fantastic location on the deck which makes you forget you are in the city. Of special note was the Gin Tonic East which uses the new Bombay Sapphire East gin which has heavy herb overtures which are absolutely delicious on a hot summer day.

Santé!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited the bar at Ritz Carlton on a few occasions for drinks after work.  What can I say, it's kinda swanky and the drinks are good, if expensive.  But hey, it's the Ritz, your paying for the ambiance.

Now, on a recent Thursday night, my friend and I decided to hit up DEQ for a final glass of wine to top off our evening.  This place is fabulous, absolutely fabulous.  We ordered a glass of New Zealand Sauv Blanc and sat back to enjoy the live entertainment, which was pretty good...only problem is they pack up at 9pm, so at most we got to enjoy 3 or 4 songs...so that was a bit disappointing.  However, watching the high priced call girl make her rounds approaching the single men on the patio was more than entertaining and managed to fill the void left by the band once they left for the evening.

Our glass of Sauv Blanc came with a serving of hand crafted potato chips...made fresh and perfectly salted.  They were awesome.

I will definitely go back, probably for food and wine, and definitely earlier in the evening in order to fully enjoy the live entertainment."}
{"text":"Went for late night cocktails as previously had a fun, lively and enjoyable experience. Though it wasnto as lively, attributed it to being a Wednesday night, but still felt we could have an enjoyable time.
The server quickly took our order in an efficient , though not very interested manner. Drinks were then delivered at different times. 

As various people finished their drinks, they looked for our server to order another, but the few times he was seen, they couldn't get his attention, then he wasn't even seen. After about 20 minutes of waiting after last person finished first drink, we decided to leave. It took 10 minutes to locate him and ask for the bill.

Expected far better service from a lounge in a luxury hotel offering fairly expensive drinks. Not only did it dampen our groups spirits but the lounge lost the sale of a second round and future business"}
{"text":"went to DEQ twice, of course it is pricey, because its in Ritz Carlton, however, if you are gonna sit there for hours to discuss business plan or chill with your lover, then it will be a perfect spot. The food is usually in big portion than my expectation, well generally because they are charging you double of the price, for example a Truffle Parmesan Fries for $16, thats why they give you huge portion. Anyway you can't really complain because other than the price, service of this place is exceptional and if you really care about the money more than service, then you should consider going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here during the work day at around 11am with a coworker and sat out in the patio for a coffee. It was nice and quiet. Waitress was attentive and kind. Atmosphere is nice, has various seating ranging from couches to small tables/2 chairs. Plenty of sun or shade, you can choose your seats based on where the umbrellas are placed. We didn't eat here, only got a quick coffee and left after an hour."}
{"text":"While I was visiting Toronto, my family and I had the opportunity to experience Afternoon Tea: Teas of Japan at DEQ Terrace and Lounge inside the Ritz Carlton in Downtown Toronto.

The restaurant features Sloane Fine Tea Merchants, a local brand of premium specialty teas. You had a choice of one of following teas: (1) Featured Tea - Tropical Green, (2) Celebration Medley, (3) Heavenly Cream, (4) Darjeeling, (5) Jasmine Snow Dragon, (6) Golden Assam, (7) Malasa Chai, (8) White Peony, (9) Oolong, (10) Chinese Green Tea, (11) Marrakesh Mint, (12) Ginger Twist, and (13) Citron Calm. You must select one tea based on your senses (i.e., smell). My favorites were Tropical Green and Heavenly Cream. Each person will get their own teapot. 

Each themed afternoon tea came with a tray of savory bites and sweet treats. 

The savory bites consisted of a crispy Spinach Scallion and Red Pepper Quiche; a mini Sesame Crusted Charcoal Burger filled with grilled Japanese Eggplant, spiced Tofu Salad, and crispy shallots; a crunchy Sesame Burger filled with crispy Panko crusted chicken, candied plum relish and tonkatsu sauce; a Crab, Cabbage, and Scallion Okonomiyaki topped with sesame seeds, kewpie mayo and bonito flakes; and a flaky croissant filled with drizzled wasabi mayo and Yuzu Cured and Smoked Salmon, pickled radish, and romaine. My favorites were the Quiche and Spiced Tofu Salad.

The sweet treats consisted of a scoop of Matcha Ice Cream served with red beans, lychee, melon, kiwi, and strawberry; Japanese cotton cheesecake; Yuzu Cream Brûlée; Strawberry Roll Cake (a vanilla roll cake filled with whipped cream and fresh strawberries); Matcha Tea Cream Cake, and Freshly Baked White Sesame Scones (served with chantilly cream and assorted fruit jams). The favorites were Matcha Ice Cream, Strawberry Roll Cake, and Matcha Team Cream Cake. I disliked the Yuzu Cream Brûlée as it had a strange flavor to acquire, it was tart to taste, and it was rich and heavy to consume."}
{"text":"Enjoyed drinks at DEQ while visiting Toronto. The ambience was quietly invigorating. The decor is deep seat dark outdoor furniture with white cushions and other muted tones. Large heat lamps provide a barrier between each section as well as warmth during cooler nights. The servers were highly attentive, and when our party asked to move to the terrace the staff was quick to set a table for us. The menu included beers, wines, cocktails and light appetizers. If you are looking for a relaxing area to enjoy a cocktail or an appetizer, I highly recommend trying DEQ. I will be returning during my next visit to Toronto and would recommend this establishment to friends and family members visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Deq is a great casual spot in the predominantly formal Ritz-Carlton.  This is the perfect place for a night-cap and a little snack.  Prices are a bit over the top, but that is expected given its location in the Ritz.

They serve a perfect snack size burger and some really good truffle fries.  If it gets a little busy, expect slightly slower service.  Drinks are somewhat subpar based directly on ice that is used.  It's the small pellet ice that ruins the drinking experience.  Your best bet is probably a selection of wine from their extensive list.  The best seats in the house are couches next to the outdoor fire pit, especially on a cool night.

4 stars for the setting and quality food.  1 off for the ice."}
{"text":"If this was at any other place, I would say great food and great drinks. However, I expected better quality of food and drinks being this is at the Ritz Carlton. Service is always at the top standard. That is what makes the ritz the ritz!
Food was good but not great. Quinoa salad had a lot of flavors that came out but something was missing.
I got the The Mad Botanist drink. A little too strong that it was only able to be sipped every couple bites.
If this was not at the Ritz, I would have gave it four starts. I expected better from the Ritz Carlton."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to try the high tea because it lists under the top 10 high tea places in Toronto. 

The environment was good, the service was good. However, I'm not quite sure if the price worth it. The food is okay, but not great. They serve you sandwiches on the first tower, then you will have desserts on the second tower. It's a good place to catch up with friends or to meet with people for business. Not quite sure if I will go back unless I have a special occasion."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good ambiance & service. My favourite afternoon tea in the city so far. 

I came for the Sweetheart Afternoon Tea - the February special, $54 set comes with sparkling wine. They have a different theme & menu each month! Regular tea set is $44 without the wine. I loved the modern presentation and how we had a chance to smell the tea selection before ordering. My favorite food was the chicken salad sandwich on beet brioche bun, and in general all the sandwiches were great, very detailed and well prepared. Loved the scones as well, and the quiche tart, banana eclair and chili chocolate is definitely not something you see on every menu. 

Service can be improved in the waiting area - no signs or server to greet us, we were just standing at the top of the stairs as it was assumed that was the designated area. Eventually had to go down and try to flag someone down. 

Overall, highly recommended afternoon tea. I'll be back sooner than expected if the wallet allows! PS: No walk-ins, make reservations few days to a week in advance. 15% service charge added."}
{"text":"Dropped by here before heading off to the Leafs game and was impressed by the professional and attentive service and quietly luxurious ambiance that cloaks the lounging area. For a high end property known for it's moneyed touches, the menu at The Ritz Carleton is quite reasonable and the food was tasty and left you wanting to order more. Server kept the beers cold and once we were ready to head off, we weren't kept waiting for the check. Go."}
{"text":"Whoaa! Easy trigger!!

After dinner the other night I decided to head to Deq to check out the scene. The rave yelp reviews made this place seem like one of the best bars on earth. Well, it isn't. Here's the low down....

1. I went on a weeknight after nine. The place was basically dead. While I wasn't looking for a party, I expected to see more than the bartender's mom. Perhaps it is much more lively when there is a big show in town or on weekends.

2. The place is really nice. It does have a great high end vibe that compliments the hotel. Interestingly, bar seating is limited to 10-12 seats. There are lots of tables and a few sofa groupings.

3. The drinks were too sweet. Both the New Fashioned Old Fashioned and another Gin drink were much sweeter than they needed to be.

4. The cocktails are all $16 each. While this may be standard for a high end place, they were too sweet (see above), and there was simply nothing special about the mixing, presentation, or service.

If you want to spend more than necessary on cocktails, and you like a well-made drink with a touch of flair, my advice is to try The Harbord Room or Yours Truly."}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars!! I think the high tea here is way better than the others I have tried.  Customer service was excellent and the presentation was really nice:) Food was well prepared and I found it quite fulfilling and didn't go super hungry later on.  I would definitely come here if you have a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had the chance to enjoy the DEQ terrace today with a friend (enjoying it after a TIFF movie).

What a great place.  Wonderfully comfortable chairs outdoors - such a nice private space and great ambiance.  We enjoyed some white wine and prosecco and the crab dip.

The crab dip was one of the best we have ever had, and the drinks wonderful and cold.

I have to say - the Ritz has \"it\" right.  The \"it\" being service.  We went in and the front bar was closed so the concierge escorted us to DEQ and helped us find a table.  Then Megan looked after us for the whole time we were there.  She did a fantastic job (thanks Megan!).

We had actually seen a movie at TIFF Lightbox and tried to get a drink at the Luma bar afterwards and after sitting for a while at the bar being totally ignored, we left and went to the Ritz.  Best move we ever made!!

Folks -- this place is in the same price cat as Luma or any other of the nice bars like Canoe, or Bymark and so if that is the kind of spot you enjoy then try out DEQ, you won't be sorry!

We'll back and it won't need to be during TIFF either!"}
{"text":"This review gets two stars; on the occasions where I actually did take Afternoon Tea at Deq, their scones had tasted heavenly. Both stars are applied to their scones.

However, though I used to love Deq for taking Afternoon Tea - over the Windsor Arms in fact - their service has gone severely downhill as far as I am concerned. 

Calling the reservation desk, I managed to confirm my reservation with the nice lady on the phone. Except that it turned out, my confirmation wasn't a confirmation at all. A detail I found out when they sent me an email, asking me to send my credit card information over email in order to hold my reservation. If they had asked for it during the initial phone conversation to begin with, I would have been happy to provide them that information. 

When I called to tell them I wasn't happy with the idea of sending them my information over email, they told me that it was their policy for reservations, and they were not going to make exceptions. A week later, they called, trying to get my CC data over the phone.

By that point, I had managed to secure reservations at the Library Bar at Fairmont and while I did love Deq, honestly, I was quite disillusioned by their service by that point."}
{"text":"Just barely, but what the hay, the Ritz deserves it with the name.  And don't let the name fool you, it is on ground level.

situated way in the back, through the lobby.

As usual, don't expect much with hotel food, but rhe lobster salad roll were yummy, not sure if $25 is OK for the average Joe off the street.  Thank goodness client paid this time lol.

Service:  impeccable.  think her name was Sarah, 6 feet tall of gorgeousness and professionalism for such a young lass.   One guy's jacket fell off the chair, she walked it over to hang.

And she refilled water constantly plus the most amazing olives, which she said were marinated in rosemary, oil and thyme.  And I normally do not eat these alone like peanuts.  High quality paper picks too."}
{"text":"Review for Afternoon Tea

I came here in a party of five for a pre-wedding celebration. They do afternoon tea sets from 2-4pm on weekends only -- reserve in advance because it can get busy. When we were there there were lots of birthdays, family gatherings, and other groups.

There are a variety of choices from the \"classic tea\" to sets that have cocktails or champagne. We just went with the classic tea ($38 per person). Our server brought out a nice box of teas - 12 kinds. She clearly specified which were caffeine-free, low caffeine, and regular. There were some herbal teas, oolong, green tea, and black teas. She left the box with us for a few minutes so we could smell the different teas. I went with the vanilla rooibos which was perfectly sweet and didn't need any added sugar. 

Then the savoury bites came out, beautifully presented. My favourites were the smoked salmon croissant and mushroom quiche (there were also meat quiches, I think with bacon). The raisin scones were quite good too, although I'm not a fan of raisins. The portions are mostly bite size and look small, but it's deceiving... It actually adds up to a lot of food! I was glad I skipped lunch so I had room to eat everything. 

Next were the sweets. There were so many things we couldn't finish... There were a variety of flavours, definitely something for everyone. The winners for me were the opera cake and lemon meringue tart. 

Everything was very well done and fresh. I had a much better experience compared to the last time I had afternoon tea which was at the King Edward Hotel. Service was good. We sat inside and when I asked if we could sit on the patio, the server was very serious and apologetic, stating that they do not serve afternoon tea on the patio (something about the wind blowing things away, or the clotted cream melting in the sun... apparently the chef was quite adamant that it's an indoors only affair...). Overall, a lovely place to spend an afternoon. It's not cheap but for a special occasion it's worth the splurge."}
{"text":"DEQ offers Downton Abbey-grand afternoon tea with a modern flair, and the tea party theme rotates fashionably every season with Japan as the current theme.

Reservation is highly recommended as sometimes it takes month-advance booking during busy summer season to secure a tea time.  I managed to steal a slot for 3 on Sunday 12pm, and brought my crew here for some pinkies-up moments. 

The ambience is exquisitely beautiful with floor to ceiling windows brightening up the place, and sunlight bouncing off of pink orchids and wooden panels. Seating is quite spread out; giving you plenty of privacy to laugh at your gossips, but the chairs are old and worn out on the edges. 

We went with the $44 Classic option that comes with a pot of tea (sparkling wine is available at few dollars more) and we all cooed at the wooden box full of specialty-blended tea inserted in like individual jewels.  There are three rows of tea from non-caffeinated to caffeinated hand-crafted by a special tea lady sold under the label Sloane.  I love the high-end tea apparatus that DEQ has invested, as every tea is steeped within a La Creuset pot @$55/each.  However, teas are not supposed to be drowned in the pot, rather, they should be steeped, and then taken out on the side, and only to be put in the tea pot when the next steeping is required. 
 
The savories came first, and of course the presentation is a show-stopper and a kodac moment for people who like to take photos of their food.  There was the karage slider representing the Japan theme which is interesting but I wished it was warm.  The pepper and eggplant flat bread was a meh, but the shrimp pastry was light and balanced. Our favorite was the smoked salmon croissant with pickled Daikon (tribute to Japan) - the sweet and crunchiness of the pickled daikon is beautifully juxtaposed against the saltiness and soft texture of the salmon. 

I must disappointingly claim that the sweets were not good, including the scone except the passion fruit puff. The puff was light, airy and the filling was just the right balance of sweet and sourness of passion fruit.  

The yuzu tart was interesting - thanks for inserting that Japan theme in there but I didn't think it worked well.  The matcha and strawberry cake was fluffy, but the combination of the bitterness of matcha and sweet and sourness of strawberry didn't work well either. 

Onto the raisin cake that was cutely decorated with a layer of white icing and a sakura candy - cute, but the cake was quite dry and average.  The green tea sable cookies were alright on their own, but I would go easy on the sugar dusts because they over-power the cookie. 

And lastly I hate to say that the scone was meh, because scone is almost the standard upon which an afternoon tea is judged.  It was not a rock, it had reasonably fluff, but it was dry, and it was cold.  When I asked the waitress if she recommend eating scones first, she recommended it last because it might be too heavy and fills you up.  However by the time you make it to the scones they are cold, and sad, and we were sad. 

Overall would I recommend this place? Well given the average price of an afternoon tea in the downtown area is $37.50 - $50, then sure, based on what you get in comparison to other places then okay.  But if I were to evaluate on absolutely terms I'd rather have spent the money on bakeries that do well on one/few single items, than to shell out for a mish-mash afternoon tea. 

Cheerio!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent ambiance but the service was slightly sub par to what I was expecting from The Ritz. 

We were a group of 8 that went to celebrate one of our friends birthday. The team of the season is \"Alice in Wonderland\". 

The decor is quite cute, I liked all the props around the tea salon as it was done tastefully. The staff was also costumed, although only one waitress was dressed in a cute costume. The others had some kind of underwhelming accessories. 

The food we has was quite stunning. The quiche, shrimp sandwich and turkey bites with mango were really out of this world. The assortment of sweets were also quite delightful and well balanced. A lot of the food items were bearing decorations that reminded of Alice in Wonderland and it was nicely done. 

As for the tea, I went with the Feuilles d'argent, a tea that had nice creamy and light floral tate. This tea was made exclusively for the Ritz.

I think that they they were understaffed as it took an awful long time to get started and by looking around the room, some other tables were also looking around appearing to wonder were the servers were. 

The service was nice, the waiters always explained what the teas were and what the food items were, but it was a very reactive service, not proactive. 

There was no follow up in between the services, we had to remind them our water glasses were empty and that some of our tea pots sat with the lids off for a long while, waiting to get more hot water. In the world of luxury these are little details that make the difference. 

Overall I just wish there would have been a better staffing situation.All they employees were very nice and doing their best but like I said, service should have been more proactive."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, delicious food and wonderful service. While we had a wonderful time, I feel the price is a bit steep for what you are offered, however that tends to be how it goes when dining in upscale restaurants. 

The great gatsby theme was a wonderful idea but poorly executed. It was not as prominent as I would had hoped. 

The presecco  was tasty and there was a great variety of food, both sweet and savoury. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I LOVED the high tea here! Everything about it were up to my expectations. High tea here is so much better than Windsor Arms... First of all, they present you with this pretty box that lights up with your tea selection inside. There are 9 individual smaller containers within the big box that contain different types of tea and you can open up the lid to smell the scent of the tea. On the lid of the big box displays the names and description of each tea.

We started off with a quiche and then the savoury tray of high tea was served which included salmon croissant sandwiches and some other stuff i dont remember (look at the pictures i uploaded) but it was just GOOD! The sweet tray came next and I was so happy that they served macarons! Windsor Arms didn't serve any macarons so that was a huge disappointment. So the sweet tray included some typical stuff like very fluffy scones, red velvet cupcakes, a miniature tiramisu, minature eclaire and such.

One other thing i really like about high tea at Ritz is the presentation of the food. They serve the food in this round shelf-like thing and neatly organize the food on each level. One of the main reasons why I like this place, i know this is going to sound stupid, but the presentation of the food. A lot of other high tea places present the food on a tower with a plate on each level and food just scattered on it. I hate that! It makes the food so unattractive and unappetizing. It's true when they say your eyes eat first."}
{"text":"Review Number 300 will go to this special meal. My best friend and I have a birthday tradition where we do Afternoon Tea. This was usually reserved for my birthday but we've started doing this for hers as well, determined to conquer Toronto's Afternoon Tea options. What can we say? We love a good crustless sandwich, hot brew and a good gossip session. 

VIBE 
DEQ wasn't what I expected. I think I thought it was going to be more \"formal\" and though everything in the Ritz is formal, this had a nice, casual atmosphere to it. Decor is beige and black with hints of white. Chairs are comfortable which you will need if you are around for over two hours. 

Service is top notch, as always. There was no menu. Everything was recited by memory and with a smile. 

We didn't have a chance to see their Terrace done up but apparently it is the HOT spot and looks gorgeous. Another time! 

WE ATE/DRANK 
We had the NOT SO classic tea added to the Afternoon \"Tease\" which is their afternoon tea with the option of alcohol. I had the Berry Berry Bramble. This includes black berries, citrus and sparkling wine. For me, it was a bit too acidic. I tasted my friend's choice: pinot grigio, citrus, soda and felt like it was too dry and strong. I personally wouldn't order the drinks again if I were back. 

What's interesting about the presentation of the tea compared to other places is that the server brings you out about eight choices in a box and names each one and gets you to smell the tea before you make a selection. I think it's a bit time consuming. It's a nice gesture but time consuming, especially if it's busy. It's also a bit awkward. I didn't feel like the tea options were on par with its competitors but the teas we did have (chai and peppermint) were fantastic and topped up. 

Now onto the FOOD! 
As you can tell, this is not your typical tea sesh. The presentation of the sandwiches and sweets comes in a circular tiered object (I'm not sure what else to call it).  But it works and doesn't take up a lot of room on the table. 

I LOVED the salmon croissant sandwiches. It was a good size and the cream cheese had a great dill kick to it. Favourite! 

Everything was fantastic but we enjoyed the chocolate truffle, chocolate mousse cake topped with raspberries, madelines and scones. They give you a cute little ceramic boite for the cream and two choices of jams. I wasn't a fan of the marmalade but was a fan of the strawberry jam. You also get two raisin scones and two regular scones. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
It was a delicious, indulgent afternoon tea that made me feel at my utmost leisurely. Go in with an empty stomach because you will be rewarded. For those looking for a non-tradition afternoon tea experience, I would say this is a good bet and even better if you can get the terrace in the summer!"}
{"text":"Had an exceptional lunch experience here by myself shortly before checking out of the hotel.  My waiter,
,James perhaps, was very good.  He took the time to chat with me and made my lunch feel personalized.  I had the fancy fish and chips which was a fun spin where they replaced the white fish with lobster.  I have stayed at this hotel many many times and would recommend it to anyone.  For myself and my family, the ritz is the best place we have stayed in Toronto, largely because of the service."}
{"text":"I love DEQ!!

I love my experience so much that I wish my Yelp Drinking Buddy showing up late so I can keep having my mixed drinks and daydreaming I am enjoying my pre dinner drink at one of the resort!!

Waiters speaks with an European accent?? Where do they find all these waiters?? Polite, friendly and \"cough cough\" good looking?!!

Those wicker chaise loungers in the patio!!!... oh so comfy...great for daydreaming.... A view of CN Tower... Priceless!!

I don't really mind paying a premium for the experience... 

Raspberry Collins ($15) and Turkey Meatball Slider ($18)

And I think from now on I going to meet my always late Yelp Drinking Buddy at DEQ, he can take his sweet time........."}
