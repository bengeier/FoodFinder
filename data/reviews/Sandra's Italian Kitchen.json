{"text":"Fresh, friendly, fast! A coworker recommended this place to me and i was a bit skeptical because of the location but there isn't much healthy fresh food around here so I gave it a go and boy was I surprised. As soon as I walked in i could tell this place was good. I ordered a veal sandwich combo with a salad and it was just what the doc prescribed. Just dont order from the guy, (brother in law) he's grumpy and doesnt care to make your food right.. no sauce on the veal parmasean?! Was dry as hell. Cmon bruh. Easy lunch option!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... just amazing food and great service. Stumbled onto it for the first time on the way to get some fast food lunch and now I won't be eating anywhere else for a while. Love the authentic Italian taste and the good feeling you get like having that perfect home cooked meal. Certainly a must try :)  Ps. Highly suggest the butter tarts."}
{"text":"Sandras pizza is great and traditional.the Chicken Parma is the best in the area!  I am typically here every other Friday for lunch and I am always greeted with a smile and a delicious lunch. The sandwiches are huge and loaded with fresh ingredients. The restaurant itself has a cozy environment and is usually quite busy for lunch. Can be a little pricey but you get what you pay for here and you are paying for fresh great tasting food! I highly recommend Sandras"}
{"text":"I was craving a carrot when I walked into this place, this gorgeous woman named Cally greeted me at the counter. Her eyes were brown like a deep mahogany from my days as a wood crafter in the old country. This place has excellent food, and great service. Meatballs!"}
{"text":"I'm Italian, and I would like to say that this place makes the most authentic Italian food I've ever eaten. The food is freshly made, cooked perfectly, and seasoned to taste (a little bit on the spicy side but perfect for me anyways, if you're sensitive to spice this is a fair warning). So if you want good quality Italian food that's a bit on the spicier side you should definitely go there for your next meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome homemade Italian. Hot sandwiches are reasonably priced and very delicious and staffs are very friendly.  Sandra,  the owner will make you feel right at home.  I frequently visit this place for lunch and always will."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Quick with great service.  For my first time I was impressed. Only thing I didn't like was that it was very packed with STUFF.   Freshly made food."}
{"text":"I'm a music student at York University. Me and my friends stumbled upon this place for dinner before our concert. I was first surprised on how homey the place felt and looked. Sandra's Kitchen server authentic Italian food and it is great. It really feels like I'm in a Italian family's home eating a home hearty meal. I had a sandwich, and it lasted me for the entire performance normally I burn off a meal by the middle. This place is one of the best places for Italian cooking in the area."}
