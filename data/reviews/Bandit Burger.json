{"text":"I had a small burger and side of fries, and both were so salty I could not finish either - $13 lunch mostly tossed out. I'm not some sort of low-sodium crusader or anything (I was getting a burger and fires for lunch!) , but there's no reason food has to be so salty it's inedible. Never again. update: 20 minutes later and my lips actually hurt from the dessication! Too much salt!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Calgary. Don't agree please leave the city. Amazing crispy cheese"}
{"text":"The burger was pretty disappointing for the price. Coleslaw was tart, patties are paper thin, very greasy. Order was fast. Fries are good."}
{"text":"Burger was awesome. Loved the pickled tomatoes and fried cheese. Probably could use proper napkins instead of paper towel!"}
{"text":"I was not satisfied with the burger I ordered (beef bandit), the  beef patty was a bit  dry and not so tasty as it looks."}
{"text":"Bandit Burger takes care with their burgers, puts together unique and flavourful ingredients and creates a winner of a burger."}
