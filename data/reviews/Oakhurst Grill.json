{"text":"Love this place.  Great food.  Huge portions. Awesome prices. From soulful comfort food to healthy options.  And the young women that works the counter is so sweet and nice. I'm sold.  Wish I wld have tried this place sooner"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I've had better than this place.  The lady was very friendly but the food just doesn't measure up. I got a flounder platter with rice and gravy and a side Greek salad. The fish was simply not good. The breading was tough and the flavor bland. The rice had maybe a tablespoon of gravy on it and was dry. And the Greek salad was hardly Greek. It only came with cucumber and tomato. I wish I would have spent my $10 at Walmart and fried my own fish."}
{"text":"Super good food! Their southern everything is on point! Highly recommend the hush puppies!!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here yet but I ordered take-out for 11 guests who were in town and they licked the plates from what I was told. I couldn't stay to eat (had to go to work) but my friend said the guests were going crazy over how good it was. Can't wait to try it myself."}
{"text":"You cannot contain your excitement when Oakhurst Grill hands you your greased stained bag filled with your delicious, simple burger, all the way, extra mustard, reaching in your bag you burn your fingers on hot, crinkle cut fries, it's all you can do to find a place to stuff yo face. Simple little carry out, hot order grill. Friendly service and great food.  Next time you're craving a burger wrapped in white paper, go get you some greasy goodness! In the best possible way!"}
{"text":"Oakhurst Grill was available on Postmates when I tried it first. I've now ordered Oakhurst 3 more times since 2 days ago. I've fell in love! The classic bacon burger is always great. Their seafood platter with Green beans, mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, and fries is delicious! I also recommend the Hot Wings platter. All in all, great place. Platters are alot of food and delicious."}
{"text":"After my boyfriend told me they had the best fried chicken in Charlotte I knew I had to stop by. Fried chicken isn't something I eat often due to my mother being an amazing cook and fried chicken was one of her specialties. When I tell you I don't do KFC, Popeyes, or Churches.... I'm serious about my fried chicken. This place is strictly take out which is fine with me... No need for witnesses. I ordered the quarter chicken with collard greens and fried squash. My wait wasn't long but long enough to see the clientele ranged in age and race. My food came out hot and with a smile. Let me tell ya.... The chicken was very good. Crispy and seasoned well but the star of the show was the fried squash. It was cut into thin chips and fried hard. Delicious! The greens were a lil bland but nothing a lil salt couldn't fix. I did call my mom to let her know I found a fried chicken spot in Charlotte. I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Three words: where's the seasoning?!  I decided to give them a try and I got their flounder plate. I even got the additional two pieces they offer because I love fish. I wish I would have saved $2 and just gotten the three pieces the plate comes with. It was bland! So was their macaroni & cheese and fried squash. The hushpuppies were the only thing I liked because they're sweet just the way I like them. I'll give something else there a try another time, but what I got didn't cut it."}
{"text":"Oakhurst is a great spot for some diner/grill food to go! I always get the chicken pita with extra cucumber sauce and the potato wedges.   I've tried a couple of Greek places in town, but Oakhurst is the best for what it is. Other places are either way over priced or are afraid to give you any special requests."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here, particularly the chicken tenders and sweet tea (among the best tea in Mecklenburg, seriously). Sometimes the simple things are the most satisfying and that's something Oakhurst Grill does very well.  The service is also great, the cashiers are always pleasant and conversational, it's a nice experience and if you're in East Charlotte you should definitely check them out."}
{"text":"When I first moved here I worked near Oakhurst then called Mr. C's. Got back over that way and we called our order in and it was ready to go when we got there.     It's still as good as it was all those years ago. I also have done the Double Cheeseburger with fries and its great. My wife got the BLT and said it was good also.   If in the area do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"Mr C's  Don't know why they changed the name, but the same owners same menu same quality! I've been eating there for 20 years. Good food huge portions, reasonable prices.Take out only. My favorites, Grilled chicken salad, hamburger steak, Big John's Special (double cheese burger and fries), fried chicken (ask them to dip it in their buffalo sauce), mashed potatoes, pintos, fried squash.....  Call in your order, go pick it up, it will be ready and the order will always be right. Oh, don't forget their sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Oakhurst Grill is literally 2 minutes away from my house and it has taken me waaaaaay too long to stop by. The other night my fianc√© had a boys night out on the town and I decided to stay in and get some much needed relaxation and me time. I was pondering Yelp for about an hour looking for something new and delicious to eat for dinner when I came across Oakhurst Grill and initially chose it for the convenient location-I was being super lazy! But boy am I glad I tried it.  This place is very small, a cute little nook in the wall and only offers take out. The menu is EXTENSIVE and CHEAP! They offer everything from burgers, to salads, to comfort southern food, to grilled cheese, and kids items as well. They staff is so friendly and really quick, which is sometimes hard to find in the south (the fast part haha).  I ordered the cheeseburger special-included the burger with all the toppings you want, french fries, and tea, and also a side order of hush puppies. All of these items really big portions and delicious AND I got all of this for 8$!!!! I mean you can't go wrong with that. I had food left over at the end of the night for the next day.  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu, especially it being so close! Definitely a go to restaurant/location on our list now."}
{"text":"Oakhurst Grill used to be called Mr. C's...  and for those of us that have been eating there since we were kids it's still programmed in our phones as \"Mr. C's\"  :-)  This is a little place on Monroe Road that only does southern grandma style to-go service.  They have burgers, fried chicken, vegetables, the best cucumber salad in the summertime, fried squash like Gus' USED to make...(If you're from here - you know what I mean!!) You call them, you place your order, and it's ready in 10 minutes.  Boom Bam!...Out the door!  The lady that answers the phone takes the order and I'm telling you...  she's a-f#cking-mazing at her job...  the woman has never ever gotten my order wrong...  apparently it's her super power.?.  they cook your order and it's big portions cooked like you're expecting, hot and fresh.  Get a menu, take it home, program the number in your phone  :-)"}
{"text":"After driving by countless times and asking my boyfriend \"Mmm.. what's that smell?\", we decided to try this place.   Alright, so one downside is that there's no seating inside. But that's canceled out by the fact that we live 2 seconds away, so that solves that problem.  I've only seen one woman working the counter every time we've gone. Not sure what her name is, but she is very sweet and quick with the whole take your order and pay process.  The food comes out quickly, and oh man is it good. My boyfriend has had the pita burger and the Big John Special, both of which he said were very good. I cannot break my pattern of ordering the barbecue platter.. it is just so delicious. The mac & cheese and collard greens are just as good."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this is my go-to spot for fast, good food. The staff is always extremely friendly. Their platters could easily feed two people so the prices are awesome considering the amount of food you get. May not look like much from the outside but thumbs up for their food and their employees!"}
{"text":"One of the most reliable spot to grab a veggie plate! You have to try the fried squash, and the pinto beans."}
{"text":"An oldie restautant (it had a different name before) but VERY good food! All foods are freshly cooked to order. They have 'daily special plates', all of which are excellent and you CAN substitute a side if needed.  My #1 requirement @ EVERY place I go out to eat is their CLEANLINESS RATING. Oakhurst Grille is always CLEAN, NEVER has any odd smells (well ventillated) like fish, garbage, grease. The staff get to know you and are polite, professional, caring. I have been taking food out there x 30 yrs and live in Churchill Downs n'hood. You get plenty of food for the prices....no skimping on anything. Also, I have NEVER ONCE had an order screwed up!!! In the summer, get their tomato/cuke salad...VERY GOOD. No better take out food restaurant in the Cotswold n'hood!!! We order from there 3 to 5 x week."}
{"text":"Holy Hush-puppies, Glorious Greens, Mighty Mac and Cheese...oooo lawwwd! Positively pallet pleasing pulled pork!  Whew - On to the review:  First off I never knew Oakhurst Grill for what it used to be called. I moved here not too long ago and drive by this place everyday, twice a day on the way to and from work. I decided one day to come in after the gym for some pulled pork. I had a deep craving that needed to be filled.  This is To-Go-Style, so you can wait for your for which is less than 10min or call and pick it up.   I ordered the pulled pork BBQ plate with mac and cheese and collard greens. You get a lot for what you pay for (Just under $10) and I had to put half in the fridge I was so full. I really liked the pork, and the collards were good. Not too salty, not overcooked. I also enjoyed the mac and cheese and devoured that in no time, no left overs on that end. They also popped two hush puppies in my to go box and a roll. Let me just say - -  these are probably the best hush puppies I've had since I moved to NC, and so that it very exciting.    I will be back, and can't wait to try something different!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the oakhurst neighborhood and I've had Oakhurst Grill twice already. It's the perfect touch to the area. Great food and the service is consistant which is a plus. Busy place during lunch hour. To-go only."}
{"text":"Originally Mr C's but still owned by the same delicious making southern food people. The BBQ is simply amaz-balls. Seriously. Get it. Also get the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place for years and never stopped. I Ordered this through Postmates because it was available and I was hungry. It was an excellent coincidence. It was delicious and exactly what I didn't know I was in the mood for. I got the chicken tenders platter with Mac & cheese, fries, and hush puppies. I'm excited to try other things, but I would definitely get this again!"}
{"text":"Let's be real. This place is cheap and really fast on postmates....but it is crap quality. Not sure why it has any 3 star reviews, let alone fives. I am calling BS on some of those reviews.   The burger isn't big enough to have \"grease soaking through\" and it is a generic thin patty. The fried chicken sandwich was below average.  Fried Okra, okay. Mac...cheeseless.   Best thing about our food...that iced tea hit the spot on a warm day."}
