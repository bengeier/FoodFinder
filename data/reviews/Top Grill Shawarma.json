{"text":"Tried their chicken shawerma today and its by far the best shawerma in Toronto specialllly the chicken !!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few times where Yelp mislead me. The food overall was meh. I ordered the mixed platter but the beef was overcooked. The chicken was better but still a bit too tough. At least the rice, white sauce, salad and bread were excellent and very fresh.

The beef was so overcooked that I had to toss those pieces out. Also, the lady that worked there hardly made any eye contact with me. It was hard to tell if she was speaking to me or the chef as she would look down when speaking.

I give this place a 2.5/5 but rounding up to 3."}
{"text":"Had take out from here just after New Years'- fantastic idea. Roommate grabbed chicken shwarma and falafel. The falafel was delicious.and came wrapped with fresh ingredients. Great to grab for a quick take out."}
{"text":"Friendly service with quick preparation, I would recommend the chicken over the beef as it's very tender and flavorful. great place!"}
{"text":"Their beef shawarma is very delicious. They grill the meat before putting it in the wrap so it develops a nice char & smoky flavour. I will definitely be back. They are very friendly here. It's a family-run place."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma with all the toppings. Hot sauce is unbeatable paste style, highly authentic. They have weekly deals. Monday is 2 shawarma for 10$  can't beat that. I will try the plate at a later date."}
{"text":"I hadn't had a shawarma in probably 8 years and decided I needed to have one again. 

Went to this place and the lady in there was busy with another customer but she acknowledged us in a friendly way and said she'd be right with us. That's how all service people should be when helping someone else yet lots of people don't do it.

I had the beef and my girlfriend had the chicken one. You pick what other ingredients you want in it.

The shawarmas were huge and we were both full after 3/4 of the way through but both of us finished ours because they were so damn tasty and we couldn't put them down.

I've had shawaras a couple of times since but they couldn't match this place."}
{"text":"Terrible food; saw the reviews and went there but was a big mistake; ordered a chicken shawarma dinner and it was very crappy. Service was super poor; they do not value customers at all. Would never go again"}
{"text":"Recently moved to this area.  Tried both beef and chicken platters and Schwarmas and after trying a few this place is our weekly staple.  Fresh healthy, reasonable priced, we love coming here.  The rice has so much flavour, texture, and fragrant ( they put little noodles in there ) and the mean is full of flavour.  I don't try any other middle eastern places since I've tried this one!"}
{"text":"Very valuable restaurant. Tried both the chicken and the beef shawarmas and both were tasty and fresh. It was quite surprising that the beef slices inside the shawarma had a hint of curry flavour in it, but it was good! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma ever, period.
Tastes like it's from scratch, it's amazing.
Go now."}
{"text":"Really loved the shawarma wrap from this place. Very happy to find such a good shawarma place nearby. I personally do not like Osmos.... It's so gross idk why ppl like it. . This tastes so much better. The chicken is super juicy and tasty and they have great daily deals such as 2 chicken shawarma wraps for 9.99 on Mondays or something like that. Definitely recommend this place for people who enjoy a quality shawarma :)"}
{"text":"I've order take out twice and enjoyed the food. The dessert are very good and worth trying more then one kind"}
{"text":"food was pretty good. waited a long time for it but the portion was large enough. most of the ingredients were store bought and or frozen, which is why i didnt rate higher"}
{"text":"Loved that she grilled up the shawarma meat. The salad was dressed and tossed. This is definitely my new fave shawarma spot on my way home from work! Just a few minutes walk from Clarkson GO."}
{"text":"Owner is a douchebag - serves yellowed tomatoes, and if you ask for a different piece, he screams, \"I can't do that, I can't do that!\" Worst customer service, sauce is too tangy, and frozen kebabs. First and last time eating here."}
{"text":"Great place. Honestly best shawarma I have had. Owner is a great guy, really friendly. Food taste fresh and everything is made right in front of you."}
{"text":"Awesome food !! Do try it , you won't be disappointed :) try their mixed grill ( chicken and beef ) ! Good spices and good food !"}
{"text":"So finally tried this shawarma spot and to my surprise it was pretty good ! Got 3 different dishes and they were all tastey ! Very impressed !
Place looked clean and service was decent ! 
I'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I grew up in clarkson but  live in etobicoke now  .ive tried looking for a shawarma joints  that compares to top grill.No luck i keep coming back to clarkson for my shawarma fix . They are generous with their portions and the taste is unbeatable. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill. Me and my wife used to come here twice a week but slowly started noticing it wasn't the same . They have way too much fat in the chicken and run out of the basic toppings all the tim and the garlic sauce has absolutely no flavour. On another note my wife's wrap was wrapped so bad. It was torn and completely fell apart and the paper they put around it was burnt onto it and wouldn't come off. I would not suggest visiting here ... do yourself a favor and go to pita and grill beside starskys!"}
{"text":"Top Grill's shawarma is the best shawarma in Mississauga right now, I think. The owner is such a lovely man, and the service is always super friendly-- and they don't skimp on shawarma fillings! My favourite things on the menu are definitely the chicken shawarma wraps and the falafel (I haven't had them in a wrap yet, but by themselves they are AMAZING), and they're quite affordable too. The only thing I wish they did differently would be including a sweet condiment option (not necessarily ketchup, but maybe a sweet tahini sauce or something) but I absolutely love their garlic sauce and all the other condiments. I love this place, definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"The chicken Shawarma poutine is to die for! Have been there many times and have not had a bad meal once. The family platter is also great!"}
{"text":"There was a little bit of a line, but no big deal. The service was friendly, the prices were cheap, and the shawarma was great!"}
{"text":"Move over Osmow's!!! You have some serious competition in Mississauga now. Located  in a plaza, right beside M&M's store at Southdown & Lakeshore, the food served at this place will not disappoint! 

Don't expect too much from their service though."}
{"text":"I don't think this place lives up to the rating anymore. I did agree in the past but recently the food is nothing crazy and the service is grumpy.  On top of that, the daily specials are gone. Time to find a new shawarma place"}
