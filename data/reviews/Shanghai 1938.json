{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Shanghai 1938? What happened then? What does it mean? As it turns out, it means I make judgements based on the superficial and that I deserve what I get. We were 7 minutes inside the restaurant before anyone acknowledged we were there. I interpreted the dismissive wave we got to mean \"sit anywhere, stupid,\" so we did. It took about an hour to get our food once we ordered it. I didn't expect a kiss on the lips or anything, but a \"can I get you anything else\" was in order. The food was unremarkable (despite my remarks about it at this time), and pricey. The chicken was mostly dark meat, which I dislike, and should have been cheaper based on the cheap cut.  Incidentally, there was a refugee flight TO Shanghai starting in 1938, as it turns out. Now would be a good time for me to make a crack about fleeing FROM Shanghai 1938 in 2014, but you get the picture."}
{"text":"Mediocre. I want to say this place was better a couple of years ago when I first tried it, but that might just be my memory.  The hot and sour soup is OK, but its sweet.  I mean really, sweet. I realize that Chinese food like this is heavily Americanized, but this is like someone took took a good soup and added a bunch of sugar.  The last time I got the Shrimp with Garlic Sauce, the entire dish had five shrimp.  I counted, just to make sure.  They were so overcooked they were as tough as overcooked chicken. I don't mind a lot of sauce in a dish; it's good over rice. This dish had so much sauce on it it could have been served as a soup.  I like the idea of the Hot Braised Chicken.  Its not terrible, spicy and sweet. But there nothing braised about this chicken. It's breaded and deep fried like sweet and sour chicken. Also so overcooked that the parts that weren't tough were basically chicken jerky.   The Little Dragon Buns sound exciting, but I was expecting something more like a pork filled bao, and they're really just miniature shao mai. That's fine, but for an entrée price and a house special I was expecting something more than an apetizer portion."}
{"text":"From the very first time I went to Shanghai I was impressed with the food and the owners. They are very passionate about their food and you know it is cooked fresh every time. In fact, a lot of the time when I come in the owner is sitting cutting up fresh veggies for the food. If you're looking for Chinese in Champaign, I would give Shanghai my highest recommendations!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to illinois from california. by far the best chinese restaurant I've found so far. so awesomely yummy!"}
{"text":"Service is great, owners are super nice and the food is yummy, love the crab Rangoon!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness the delivery guy came in and turned up the heat!  We sat at the table furthest from the door, freezing (sitting there in full winter gear).   The restaurant looked more like an abandoned storage unit (lots of old toys and a piano).   The bill was outrageous two TINY dinner specials and two cans of warm soda $25.  *The meat tasted like mock meat and the service was sub-par."}
{"text":"i will preface this by saying chinese food is not my first choice for asian cuisine....  shanghai is.... pretty okay.  i mean, i wouldn't turn it down if someone else was paying for it.  for dinner tonight... my husband and i ordered soup, a couple spring rolls, and two entrees.  grand total... $40.  a bit pricey, my friends, for chinese food.  it was flavorful, sure.  the order was made to my specifications.  however, it was just not *that* great.   i will also spin this cautionary tale.  if you enjoy hot and sour soup, with bean curd and mushrooms a-plenty... this is not your soup. (it wasn't mine)  this is like murky dishwater with sauerkraut and tons of black pepper.  i do realize there are variations on the recipe, but this was not one i was familiar with.     for the money, there are far less expensive chinese places in town that do as good a job, if not better than this place.  the delivery driver was super nice, and prompt, and everything... but really... for $40 i'm gonna need a song and probably some impressive interpretive dance to make it worth it."}
{"text":"This is some of the very worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. The Schezuan sauce glopped onto the fried tofu caked in this horrible, chewy wheat crust tasted no different from the hot and sour soup. The ingredients tasted spoiled. All of what I had delivered was just a brown mess. Even the rice had an old, stale smell. I can't believe people eat this. I am astounded by how terrible the restaurants in CU are, but this has hit a new low. This was the second time I have ordered food from here. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Really good food. Just not the greatest soda (you might want to ask them to change it). Also doesn't deliver sometimes."}
{"text":"Fantastic delivery service. My order included a vegetarian appetizer that they were out of. They tried calling me, but unfortunately my phone was dead, so instead they substituted TWO other vegetarian appetizers in its place. I thought this was very considerate."}
{"text":"Good chinese and friendly family run business.  I really like the shanghai crispy tofu. Its not on the menu, but it's wonderful, light, crispy, tangy sweet."}
{"text":"--UPDATE: Closed now, they moved to Auntie Lee on Green St.  Really good food and service. They have the best egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo platter Orange Chicken, probably the first time I've ever had it spicy, yes most places show the chili pepper by it but it ain't spicy...this place...yes...so that was good, but holy crap they don't mess around with deep frying...if the menu says \"lightly fried\", no, they mean lightly chickened...half of my order was hard deep fried bread with that odd looking dark chicken, not the white meat stuff I'm used to seeing.  It was $8 and filled me up, but next time I'll be getting something that hopefully isn't drowned in sauce and pretty much crunchy fried bread.  The egg roll was NOT even close to the best I've had, I would probably even skip the egg roll next time, when you can bite into the hard carrot chunks something is wrong.  Still, the sauce was tasty and for $8 filling me up it was ok...if you like fried food, go for it."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in town.  Their spring rolls are my new standard.  My favorite dish is sweet and sour pork and I like Shangahai 1938's the best-- it is fried just right.  I really appreciate how when I get delivery or carry out everything is packaged separately as well.  Plus they deliver to my house, I like that. The only reason I don't give five stars is because the quality isn't always consistent.  Some days the Szechuan Chicken and other dishes aren't as good as other days.  Thankfully those days seem to be the minority.  Our favorites Xiao Long Bao, the spring rolls, the Sweet and Sour Pork, and the Szechuan Chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food! The sesame chicken was great, and they deliver until 3am via grubhub. Great choice for 1am study parties. The fried rice and egg rolls are also very good. I have not been to the restaurant, but I'd assume that if the delivery is good, the in store food is also great!"}
{"text":"We ordered dinner thru yelp and thought we were good...our meal never came. We finally called the restaurant and they say they don't use yelp....if that's the case why is it shown as an option...I'm still hoping I don't get charged....we ended up ordering via phone, food was late getting to us and the chicken was a lot of breaded dark meat...mainly bread. My granddaughter had chicken fried rice..she kept telling us there was something crunchy..the rice wasn't cooked...bad night for Shanghai!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, messed up our order, came after an hour and it wasn't that great at all.  Get - it - together.  I'm praying I'm not gonna poop my pants.  EDIT: I totally pooped my pants."}
{"text":"Worst. Chinese. Delivery . Ever.  Chicken so overcooked, egg roll so greasy, stir fry noodles so salty.  Never, NEVER, again."}
{"text":"Food are more flavorful compared to all the other Chinese restaurants in the area . A family oriented place, casual and comfortable."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited half hour to get order taken. We where the only one there..just kept fighting in kitchen. Never again. Only reason we stayed because we where meeting out of town guests."}
{"text":"Let's see.  I got the sesame chicken combo special when I was here for about 8 bucks if I recall correctly.  It came with fried rice and an egg roll or two.  Not a bad value, and the chicken itself was really good.  The fried rice was so-so; it didn't have any eggs and only a couple onions that I saw.  I think it was pretty much just white rice thrown in a pan with some soy sauce for a minute or two.  Egg roll was tasty.  Also I think they charged me like $1.00 for a tea bag and a pot of water.  What.  Most places have free hot tea because it costs them almost nothing.  Not appreciated!  I wish I liked the food better because the woman who served us was friendly and I enjoyed the quirky menu and theme."}
{"text":"I hardly ever write 1 star reviews. Unfortunately, this place deserves it. I've tried this place twice. The second time I tried it I couldn't remember why we didn't order from this place with it being so close to our house. Upon tasting the food, I was quickly reminded.  I bought carryout and left my husband his dinner in the fridge. After eating my meal, I was actually embarrassed that that's what I left him for dinner.  The food was DISGUSTING! And I never use that word to describe food.  The crab rangoon tasted like it was cooked in really old oil. It was basically inedible. My heart broke as had to throw out one of my favorite foods in the world. (I am seriously a crab rangoon fanatic). The moo shu chicken was so salty I could hardly eat it either. I had to wash it down with plenty of water. I felt like I had enough sodium to last me a week.    Needless to say, I will not be giving this place another try.  Also, as mentioned in another review, the inside of this restaurant is so odd looking and unkempt. It looks like someone's home with toys and books and personal affects strewn about in piles everywhere."}
{"text":"Great food, but horrible service! I don't normally eat oriental food, but this place had delicious food. My only complaints are that we were being waited on by a girl who looked like she was ten years old and their delivery service is terrible. If you put up with their horrible service, you will get some amazing food."}
{"text":"Never written a review, but this place is by far the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  My fiancé and I just ordered from My Tai because we literally couldn't eat a bite. Not to mention we spent $50. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online via the Eat Street App.  ETA was 45-60min, arrived in 59 minutes.  Crab Rangoon:  Tasted more like dessert, fried wonton with sugared cream cheese filling in it.  No signs of Krab meat, scallions, or anything in it at all.  I assume it ws only sugar and cream cheese.  Not the worse thing I have ever ate, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Orange Chicken:  This was a hot mess.  The Chicken tasted like it was old, and fried again, and again in oil that was really old.  The spices were not very good either, tasted noting like the orange chicken that I was expecting.  Fried Rice:  Old stale rice covered in Soy Sauce?  Yeah, stay away.  I made the mistake of not looking at reviews since I was craving Chinese and this was the only place that had delivery.  I should've just suffered through Jimmy Johns like I normally do."}
{"text":"Major points to any delivery guy that finds my impossible to find house.  I think the price is pretty good and you get what you expect for the price.  My orange chicken had a more interesting than normal orange chicken spice to it, but my sweet and sour pork came with the pork and the sweet and sour separate, which I never like.  These guys are SERIOUS about their deep frying.  It took an hour, but they told me it would take an hour so that is completely acceptable at 7 on a friday night.  I will order from here again, I think, if only because they found my house."}
