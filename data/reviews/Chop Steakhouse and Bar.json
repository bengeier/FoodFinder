{"text":"Service was a bit slow to start. It seemed as though the servers didn't even realize there was a new table in the room. The manager ended up coming over to take our order after 15 minutes and then we finally had a waitress looking after us. Food was really good though and the steak was cooked perfectly! I would definitely go back to give it a second try."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, the service was OK... But I will never go back.  I had to ask for bread, it came without the accompanying oil or vinegar and it was one small piece of bread for two people... Worse we barely had enough butter to finish half the tiny bread.  I was scraping the bottom of the container trying to get a little butter... 

Then the food came... King crab with top sirloin... $45 and it was so small my palm was bigger and I'm not a Big guy.. 

My plate was the Oscar Top sirloin with asparagus and some other vegetables... I can't tell you what it was, because I barely saw the asparagus and the other vegetables were non existent... Oh and the steak... SMALL STEAK.  sad for $35

My guest took a bite and it went down the wrong way... So she needed water... But no water was ever offered...  I had to get up while my partner was coughing to find my waiter and ask for water immediately. 

So we ate, the taste was good... Albeit small.  The King Crab was nothing special.. 

The bill comes on half price 6oz wine  Monday nights.. And I'm billed full price... A difference of $18 plus tax.. 

I gave the waiter full tip, hut I will never return.. 
Happy Birthday to my partner... 

Don't bring yours to this place.... BAD Experience overall"}
{"text":"Just dropped in and sat at the bar a couple of times. Great selection of wines and drinks. They should add more selection to their 3-6pm happy hour.  Looking forward to dinner and a bottle of Caymus which they have $170 - not too bad price wise for an upscale."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place with all my heart but the food and service was subpar.

Our waiter was nice and recommended a great wine; the con was that he was super clumsy and kept bumping the plates on our wine glasses as he brought them to the table.

We ordered the escargot and ahi tuna as appetizers, along with a Caesar salad that came with our mains. The escargot was disgusting and the texture was very off. The majority of the escargot dish was mushrooms that were there to look like there's an abundance of escargot. Ahi tuna tasted frozen and tasteless. The Caesar salad actually tasted spicy and that was probably due to the fact that too much garlic was used when making the dressing.

For our main, I ordered the prime rib and my S.O. had the top sirloin steak. My prime rib was cooked perfectly, however, the top sirloin steak was not cooked as asked (blue rare) and was super super chewy and bland. All in all, I don't think I'd ever come back."}
{"text":"Other than this location being super far west, I absolutely enjoyed my experience. I was craving steak for quite a while so searched up good steakhouses and this was one of the top recommendations. The ambiance is very relaxing and mix of casual-classy. The server was quick and very helpful with recommendations. I like my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. I ordered their classic NY steak however I didn't really enjoy the choice of sauce that came with it. Seemed like a heavy gravy. Not entirely sure of its function however I found it interesting that they have Â´Gluten Conscious' items on their menu. Overall, my experience was quite pleasant and I do recommend their steaks."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some negative comments, but our experience was a very pleasant one for sure. Food was delicious, service was very good and prompt. My family loves the Keg and this is a very good alternative to their steak cravings when the Keg is so busy"}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner last night at Chop. This was our first experience here and we were not disappointed. We arrived at 7pm. It was busyish when we arrived. 

We sat at the bar and ordered wine. They have a good selection. Nick our bartender was attentive and helpful, willing to make suggestions and give us a taste before committing to a wine. I decided to go light and easy to drink for the first bottle for the table with, Castillo del Diablo's Cabernet Sauvignon. 

Once our friends arrived we moved to a booth which was right beside the bar. Nick continued to be our waiter and even though we took our time ordering he was patient and friendly and kept coming back to check on us. We ordered a second bottle for the table and this time we decided to go with 19 Crimes Shiraz. We decided to do the Chop experience which is basically an up charge of $8 that gives you a choice of soup or salad to start and 2 sides with your steak. 3 of us ordered the filet mignon. 2 of us ordered the French Onion Soup. It was tasty if a little salty. And 1 person ordered a Cesar salad to start. One person ordered mash and veg with their steak and 2 of us ordered a salad and seasonal vegetables. Those were green beans and roasted red peppers. The steak was truly delicious. Ordered medium it was tender and pink and the Demi glaze was a great accompaniment. The other person ordered the Chop salad. It looked really good. 

By the time our meal arrived the place was bustling. It had a great atmosphere and even though it was busy, we could all talk comfortably and didn't even realize how full it had become over the evening. 

We left at about 9:45-10pm and felt like it was an evening well spent. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The interior is very nicely decorated and arranged. Service is excellent, I really liked that the manager came to our table to check on us. The food is very good for a casual steakhouse with attention to details that not many places take the time for (ex. The caesar salad dressing is made not bought, the horseradish is fresh, 2 forks in the rollup). Ordered the ribeye with bone and it was 5/5! So big you can share it between 2. 

Protip: If you are sensitive to lactose don't order the mash potatoes. They taste amazing but are made with way too much cream. Let's just say they will exit your body as quick as they entered! Too bad because they really are delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed New Year's Eve venue. Plenty of dishes served to please the most discerning of palettes. Delicious Prime Rib and Roast chicken dishes served with seasonal vegetables."}
{"text":"My niece had made reservations for 20 or so for her sister's birthday for an early Sunday afternoon which is still considered the lunch menu.

I've been to Chop before but in Richmond, BC which was attached to the really large Sandman Hotel not far from Vancouver airport.  Funny thing I noticed is that the Sandman in Burlington also has a Chop AND a Denny's attached.  It's like a thing I guess... where there's a Sandman there's this Chop and Denny's combo going on as well.

Well this Chop in Vaughan is not attached to a hotel sistered with a Denny's but rather a stand alone structure at the south west corner of Famous and Colossus in the entire \"Weston and 7\" Cineplex Colossus theater super center complex.  This was on one of the first big box entertainment type areas in Woodbridge, before the whole Vaughan Mills thing happened at 400 and Rutherford.  Still, this area is still quite busy and with the theaters, hotels, Dave and Busters and other restaurants in the area, this older part of the Bridge is well alive and kicking.

This Chop is newly opened it seems, having signs as if it was new.  I don't know exactly how new but parking here is not a problem it seems.  As busy as this place is there's ample parking nearby.

Upon entering you can't help but notice that there's a bull made of steel constructed from a variety of automobile and other mechanical parts such as gears and bike chains by the main entrance.  It's rather cool to see such a \"mechanical bull\" sculpture as your first impression.  The restaurant itself has very modern and sleek looking decor.  Some of the booth lighting are made of glass decanters or even top hats.  Some of the dividing walls are translucent walls of wine bottles which adds to the contemporary look while the seating is firm and high back chairs or high back bench and booth seating.  The ambiance is pleasant if not a newer look for a steak house sort of how some of the newer Kegs are looking less old school with wood and dim lighting.

The dining area we had consisted of two long 10 seat tables one very long horizontal bench with chairs opposing on thick, heavy wood tables.  There was a rather helpful coat stand with as many as 12 hooks near by so we weren't all forced to use the back of our chairs.  The drink menus were on the table standing in hard cover version while the lunch menus were already at each place setting.  For a lunch menu it basically had most of the meat dinner options such as steaks and prime rib with the expected fish, chicken and other mean and veggie alternatives along with starters, small plates and lighter fare.

To start off it was mid afternoon so I did feel like having a beer.  They had a Collective Arts State of Mind Session IPA which was local and marked down as 38 IBU.  For a pale ale that's a decent hop number although I am more used to higher IBUs it's a perfect type to stock for those that like IPAs like me.  Out of the draft selections it was the only one that they bothered to list the IBU because the rest were of the ale, lager, stout tamer variety.  It was only really worth listing the IBU of the IPA.  It was clear and had a good hop taste and wasn't overly bitter.

For a starter we decided to go with the beef carpaccio.  I've had the tuna tataki before and while it was good for a single person app the beef carpaccio worked out better because of the bread sticks that came with it, it was like having two apps.  The beef was thinly sliced, and had a few capers to add a bit of zing along with grana padano on top.  It was OK but wasn't overwhelming.

I was saving my appetite for the prime rib.  It was a toss between getting the smoked ribeye or the prime rib.  In my last few trips to either the Keg or Canyon Creek I was typically getting prime rib most of the time.  For some reason I had felt like having it at Chop.

The servings came in small, medium and large mind you each of the cuts had no explanation of portion size in ounces much like the steaks did.  I had asked our server and he had replied that the large was a 14 oz serving and that was a good size for me.  At about 36 bucks it was relatively reasonable considering what this dish costs at one of the other two establishments I had mentioned.  For a size I had ordered mashed potatoes.  

The plate came and it was a very generous looking serving.  I had asked for medium rare and it seemed they had it perhaps just a wee more cooked than I expected.  No blood like rare but less pink and cool but still a nice cut of meat which was also juicy and marbled.  There was a big scoop of horseradish to the side on the plate which was a good amount but I had wished it was sharper and more \"sinus burning\" that what they had.  I hadn't asked if they had a hotter one but in hindsight I should have.  

The service here as far as keeping drinks filled and asking if everything was ok was good and was more than attentive however it did take a while to get the bills.  Overall I liked the Chop in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday at 630. We were promptly seated and the waiter came by right away to take us through the menu. We ordered escargot to start and just water to drink. I ordered the Hunter chicken and my bf ordered the Chop experience with the smoked rib eye which came with a butternut squash soup. The food was just okay but nothing super impressive. The mashed potato was a little too salty for my taste but my bf didn't mind it. The sauce on the Hunter chicken was not very pleasant but the chicken was cooked perfectly. The rib eye was ordered medium rare but it was extremely rare. Even though we had finished our escargot prior to our mains being delivered the waiter never came to pick up our empty dishes or to refill our water. He offered a free dessert as we were celebrating a birthday and upsized it to the regular size (they usually give minis for birthdays) because we were disappointed with the steak. However again, he took forever to check on us again and so we ended up sitting there waiting just to ask for our bill. 

Positives- although lacking in service our waiter was very friendly. The ambiance and decor is really nice. Perfect setting for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Friday night, busy place with excellent decor. Seems like a great place to go when the warmer weather comes and enjoy the patio.  
The view was terrible, staring at the Costco parking lot.  It was so loud in there was hard to have a conversation. 
Food was good, we had steak and prime rib.  For 3 of us the bill was just over  $200.00 with tip which I feel is pretty steep."}
{"text":"One word...Babes. They work there. Yes they do. But I have to admit that our male server was outgoing and pretty good. The food is good here, although our boss (since it was an office Christmas lunch there) who ordered the Dessert Trio for dessert, did not like the accompanying crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e because it was too dense and the top tasted burnt in a terrible way. I'm putting in my two cents to state that my sharp knife was not washed well and still stained with...something and the plates were kind of ugh. Had to do a quick wipe down with my serviette before I used mine."}
{"text":"Chop's is one of my favourite Steakhouses. I do prefer the steak at Chop's better then the Keg. I find that the steaks are more moist, softer and sizzle compared to the Keg's which is really dry. I usually get the Rib eye, despite the fact that it's 14 oz. I can usually only finish around 6-8 oz at most. It's definetly my favourite cut because it's a little bit more marbled then other cuts. For the side i got mashed potatoes which was outstanding, it was very soft and creamy. It also came with a tomato and fried onions"}
{"text":"This was not my first time at chops however it was my first time at this location. The decor is beautiful I love what they did with the place I visited on Mother's Day around 2:30 it was not that packed the dining room was full so they placed us in a booth on the lounge side which still feels like a dining room so I didn't feel out of place or anything


We ordered the steak bites as an appetizer the chunks were large and extremely juicy it was flavorful I wouldn't say I loved the flavor though it was a bit too oniony for me but I will say with the spicy mustard type sauce it came with it tasted really good and it also comes with a horseradish sauce which I decided to skip on

I ordered the Hunter's chicken which is a grilled chicken with some type of mushroom sauce which was a very tender and it came with a loaded baked potato which was delicious and some roasted vegetables don't be intimidated by the mushroom sauce the mushroom is not that powerful and it doesn't look that appetizing but it taste good

My mother ordered the baked salmon which came with roasted vegetables and quinoa she loved it and she cleaned her plate ask her all of that so we had no room for dessert"}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great meal for the most part. Good wine selection, staff was friendly and attentive, and the smoked ribeye was one of the best I've had. 

Love the vibe and atmosphere of the place too. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu. And that patio is epic.

One star off as my friends surf and turf wasn't as great, the steak was a bit mediocre. And the staff werent as well versed on every aspect of the menu as perhaps they could have been but its new so easily forgiven."}
{"text":"Try the bone in rib eye you won't be disappointed. Steak quality is right up there with Ruth's Chris but without the extra charges for sides. Service is always great, tonight we had the pleasure of meeting Brittany, very personable and excellent service. We'll definitely be coming back. 


Sad to say the service in the lounge has really dropped off my last two visits. Finally walked out of the lounge and into the restaurant and service improved considerably. Foods still great but try to avoid the lounge at this location. They're already living off their opening reputation and not keeping it up."}
{"text":"Let me start out with Taste I ordered the Prime Rib cause the menu had bragged about \"Canadian Prime Rib\".  It was cooked well but bland no salt no pepper no taste and was served with what seemed like gluten free gravy.  When you make Gravy it's made up of two main ingredients Fat usually from the meat and flour.   I also had the Wasabi mash potatoes which was pretty bad super dry and also no salt or pepper and the dryness was a major fail.  The vegetables was my second side green beans and what seems to be sweet potatoes but peas probably squash either way way under cooked couldn't even eat it.   The only thing that was decent was the French onion soup.  The dinning area, I counted about 10-12 employees talking to each other and maybe 7 guests on the dining area.  The employees were sitting down mingling with each other hardly assisting their guests when I got my check I waited 20 minutes before they came back to ring me out.  So what do they have going for them to give them the two stars?  Nice building, decor and ambience.  All the hosts, servers, and bar tenders were girls dressed to impress and very pretty. That's it... not sure if that would be enough if I lived here to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Service????? What service? 
I was sitting in the patio and had to walk in to get everything I wanted. They kept either forgetting what I had asked for or they brought it to us after I had already gone in and gotten it myself, 25 mins before. 
Our last round of drinks that were doubles had next to no liquor in them. I guess they thought we were drunk and that we wouldn't have noticed. Once brought to their attention they kept insisting that there were made right and that there was enough liquor in them. Finally they changed them. 
To top it off this place is way overpriced for the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"This steakhouse isn't the best especially considering their prices, the top sirloin is $27 for a 6oz steak and mediocre fries. The service wasn't great, I wouldn't go back nor would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 6 people for the night before Christmas Eve to celebrate a friends birthday. 

The restaurant is located in one of the parking lot in Colossus, close to Costco and near Urban Barn and although it's a new building, it feels as though its been there for ages. Outside is a patio ringed with gas lanterns and one of the largest outdoor gas fire pits that I've ever seen. Just outside the main door is a metal bull...who seems to have become a hit with budding photographers, as there was a queue of people waiting to have their picture taken on him, when we arrived. Unfortunately for us, we had a shot of his backside while dining....but thankfully the artist wasn't \"detailed\" in his artwork.
The restaurant dÃ©cor is typical steakhouse fare. I liked the idea that they repurposed glass decanters as hanging lights...very neat idea....adding some ambiance to an already warm restaurant.
We were fortunate to have a young buck by the name of Anthony as our waiter. He was fantastic. He was everything a waiter should be....warm, friendly, attentive, offering recommendations/suggestions, entertaining and he seemed to take great pride in the menu/restaurant. He was stellar ! 
I ordered the Teriyaki Steak, with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and seasonal vegetables (beets and asparagus). The veggies made our table cringe, as no one was a beet fan, but Anthony assured us that we would like them and he was bang-on. They were grilled and if not for the colour, you'd have no idea they were beets. My steak was cooked perfectly...medium rare to medium, mashed potatoes were a tad on the dry side, but still fantastic...no hint of wasabi though. The steak itself was moist with nary a hint of gristle. As we had what's called \"the Chop Experience\", it came with a side salad or soup.....I opted for the Caesar salad. It was nice and garlicky....but lacked bacon...odd for a Caesar salad at a steakhouse. 
3 people at our table ordered the steak with lobster topper (gorgonzola cheese mixed with lobster) resting \"on top\" of the steak.  They loved it!  Anthony assured those who ordered it that the gorgonzola didn't overwhelm the lobster flavour and once again, he was correct. All 3 people who ordered this dish opted for a loaded baked potato as their carb...and wow was it massive. 
After dinner (and as an added bonus), Anthony brought out a mini raspberry creme brÃ»lÃ©e for the birthday girl at our table. It was cooked in an espresso cup, with happy birthday written on the plate it sat on. I don't know if it was good (as I wasn't offered any by the birthday girl), but she woofed it down pretty damn fast.
So, in summary......warm environment, amazing service, fantastic steak, reasonably priced wine list, interesting dessert menu (both liquid and food wise), convenient location and reasonable priced.
Dinner for 6 with a bottle of wine came to just over $300. I usually tip 15% but due to the fantastic service, decided to pump it to 20%. 
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a slightly more expensive version of your regular 'The Keg/Moxies' steakhouse. I've only been here once, but the service and food were great. I liked the decor of the dining room and the ambiance of the area. I ordered the Sirloin Oscar (medium rare). The steak was cooked to perfection, and the bearnaise sauce that came with it was delicious. The shrimp that came with it was okay, but the star was, of course, the steak. Our waitress was very attentive to us and somewhat knowledgeable about the food. 

We also ordered the Peppercorn New York Steak (picture attached). I found the sauce to be alright; it definitely pales in comparison to the bearnaise sauce that came with the Sirloin Oscar. The Peppercorn steak was much larger as it didn't come with shrimp. The Sirloin Oscar steak was about half the size of the peppercorn steak. 

Overall, I'd come back and also recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Sitting in the ugly Colossus area amidst a Costco, a Staples and other bland big box stores is a location of this Canadian chain, which is owned by the same billionaire who owns Moxies and the Sandman hotel chain, et cetra.

Outside is all soulless ugliness, but there is an effort at decor and design inside. While the restaurant is on one floor only they have different levels and sections in the rather large interior.

As one can tell from the name their specialty is steaks, but I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, which exceeded my expectations. The tuna was quite good, the salad equally delicious and fresh and had just the right amount of miso. The presentation was also impressive and pleasing to the eye. I also recommend the mushroom appetizer, which was a souffle. That tasted unique as well. My friend had a steak and thought it was good. 

Unfortunately the prices are at the higher end and slightly excessive, but one has to admit that the quality and style is there. They are a cut above.

The waitresses are all very well put together and moreover polite and attentive. We received a couple of quality checks and a human conversation before the manager dropped by as well to check on the food. 

The food, its presentation and the staff add up to a upper-scale restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. It would seem like the waitress was on her first day. Almost dropped the menus, she was in heels serving us which was surprising. Also, while I was waiting to get her attention for cutlery she was getting two other waitresses to evaluate her outfit. Also, I'm not sure if it was management problem but the waitresses were all overall the place. They don't seem to designated to certain groups of tables. My particular dish was a disappointment. I ordered the mushroom tenderloin (partially my fault for not asking earlier) when I got it, the steak was smaller than the baked potatoe. They said it was 7oz, but it sure looked more like 5oz. I can finish the steak in 3 bites.

However I do recommend the Prime Rib. The small size is a decent serving size. Probably 3 time more in size compared to my tenderloin."}
{"text":"First time.
Sat at the bar...eating alone, wanted steak so why not try a steakhouse?
Waiter was very professional and personable in spite of how busy he was.
Ordered the dinner teriyaki steak with french onion soup and baked potato. Soup arrived first. Hard to screw up something so common...it was very good compared to others i have had before. Steak came before I was done my soup. Timing a bit off - not the bartenders fault -a runner brought it out.
Steak was full of flavour, cooked properly and very good except for a couple of \"chewy\" parts.  Probably because it wasnt their best cut - perhaps to be expected. But...very good in spite of that. The veggies were really good. The flavours of the steak, loaded baked potato and veggies all complimented each other very well. I really enjoyed my entire meal.
I would recommend this location to anyone on a date.  Price was very reasonable for the quality of food provided."}
{"text":"First time here. Went there this past Wednesday. The group was about 20 people for a birthday.  It was quiet being a weeknight, was not surprised. I imagine weekends are much busier. While I also admit the view is not great, but you know this when you go. So not a big deal. 

The service was amazing. We had two servers as it was a big group. The other server (forget her name) also brought a mini cake for my cousin since she knew it was her birthday! 

Kevin served us and he was awesome. Very attentive and checked up on us. The food was great. For a large group, they were so accommodating and friendly. There was no automatic gratuity added like most restaurants do for large groups. That was good but we tipped well because he earned it.

Great experience. Awesome service. Good food."}
{"text":"It was my 3rd time there and it was a 2 star with several dishes that needed to be replaced and a pretty lousy service in which 3 different people served us! But because their food was really good the first 2 times I was there I decided to leave it at 3 stars and come back again for the final review."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time it gets worst.  Today we arrived at the table and the side dishes were so dirty the stuck to the table, not one but all four and it was easily visible.

We ordered the tuna tataki  appetizer and it arrived frozen and you could see the bag creases on the fish and it was all frozen together.  They clearly cook this and freeze it for later use.  How hard is it to lightly sear tuna and slice it when ordered, instead of precooking it and freezing it?

My wife ordered a tuna salad so we made a point of asking if it was the same tuna before it came out and the kitchen we were assured it was not but when it came out it was in the exact same condition.

I ordered a halibut burger and it was ok except the onion rings that they put on the sandwich were cold and stale obviously mass cooked and set aside.

I understand this is a mid range restaurant but some things should be common sense like if you are going to serve raw tuna you should make sure it isn't frozen. Clean dishes are not only appreciated but it is the least you would expect."}
{"text":"Been to Chop Steakhouse about twice now. It's pretty good!! Both times I have gone late at night, and was still seated in a timely manner. Respectable service.

Food - Excellent quality. Though they didn't necessarily cook it medium-rare the way I wanted it done (or was used to), it still turned out great. I got the CHOP experience. I recommend getting the French Onion Soup to start, (whatever steak you choose) -- cooked to a juicy perfection, and MASHED POTATOES ON THE SIDE** MUST GET! Their mashed potatoes are amazing.

Dress - To be honest, I've come here dressed casually, but I've also seen people come here dressed up. Great for a date place or a group of friends. 

Overall, recommend this place. Would like to come back when I'm craving a steak."}
{"text":"Unfortunately have to give this a bad review. 10 of us went for dinner, awesome looking restaurant with the biggest patio I've seen yet. The food arrived quickly, wine was poured quickly before appetizers. My beer took about 20 minutes. The chef must have too much salt on hand, everything had way too much in it-Yorkshire appetizers, French onion soup, steaks, rice sauces...... Found a long black hair in my napkin and my wife found a blonde hair in her appetizer. 2 streaks were overcooked, sent one back, much better this time, not too much salt. They were very apologetic and gave 3 of us free meals and drinks (+$25 gift card). 
Will try then once more this summer maybe as they have only been open a month or so."}
{"text":"I didn't know about this Chop joint till a couple days ago. I've been to another one on Dixon and Martin grove about 4 years and haven't been back since. Met up with a few friends for some apps and drinks, and if you don't know about Chop it's casual but definitely a spot you don't wear a hoodie, but I do. They have a 5 app for $28 which was legit we got 3 chicken wing apps and 2 steak bits. Haven't tried them before and I really critique chicken wings it's just one of my things!

My bro suggested the bacon Parmesan and bbq sauce which was proper. Would come back for the wings alone. And the steak bites came with some horseradish sauce which was also delicious! It was a Tuesday night and about 3 other tables. 

We were well taken care of by our waitress and definitely helped us out each and every time.

Would I come back? Yes, as soon as I crave some wings"}
{"text":"Just tried CHOP for the first time yesterday,
You'll fall in love with the interiors the second you walk-in.
The decor is a beautiful mix of elegance, rustic and modern with many different seating sections, great for couples up-to big groups.

Reservations was easy to make online using OpenTable, however, I had to push the date, and the host was very accommodating over the phone. Although I was about an hour late and gave them a notice over the phone, the hose was once again very accommodating and got us a table in few minutes, even that they were super busy!

Our server's name was Drazen, and he showed great manners, talents and knowledge of the menu, and was very helpful answering questions and recommending their top selections on the menu.

Food came out quick, beautifully presented, and tasted great.
Ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Onion rings appetizers which were both great..and a NewYork and a Top Sirloin for mains, which both were great as well.

This restaurant is kinda similar to another leading Canadian brand steakhouse, but it gives you a little more of a \"casual vibe\"

The patio is huge with a fire pit in the middle, so I would definitely try that in the summer.

I will visit back sooner than later, great restaurant."}
{"text":"The waiter took literally 10 minutes to arrive at our table. Food was great, yet over priced."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and alternative to the Keg. I came here for lunch a few weeks ago. The decor of the restaurant was very chic and trendy, plenty of booth seating. I can't comment on their steaks, but I did have their prime rib sandwich which was very tasty! Service was good, but nothing over the top. Would definitely try this place out and give the steaks a go!"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) Let me start off by saying I've been to this location probably 4 or 5 times now before coming up with this assessment. 

I like Chop. It's a cool concept with their own unique spin on steakhouse dining, but in my opinion, it's largely overpriced for what it's aiming to be. 

There was a time where my partner and I could split steak bites (which are really good!), and another appetizer or two and still leave with a take out container of leftovers. 

Now? We're lucky if there's 9 steak bites on the plate. I've gradually observed these portion sizes becoming smaller and smaller but the price tags not comfortably justifying this. (This works out to almost $2/per steak bite.) Okay, totally recognize that this is 'technically' an appetizer - but almost $17 for this? Whaaaaa?!

Crab cakes are also a regular fan favourite, but again, $14.95 for a crab cake the size of a Timbit? Oh, and if you wanna add on another crab cake? That'll be $4, please!

The interior is nice, with an upscale ambience to it, but from time to time, I have observed that there is sometimes an undeniably pretentious vibe to some of the wait stuff. 

On the flip side - management is exceptional here. On a previous occasion, a manager walked by our table and took one look at our wings and disappeared only to return with a brand new plate and an explanation of, \"Sorry, folks. The wings you had had been sitting out for too long and you should have never received them - here's a fresh plate.\" 

One thing I *do* love about Chop is there in-house hot sauce. Wooooooow, talk about flavour, talk about punch. If you like hot sauce, I implore you to try theirs. 

I can't say that I won't be back, I likely will - however, if I had a choice between The Keg and Chop, The Keg will always win."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of a good steakhouse and tbh the Keg has been my go to place. Tried this place and not sure how I feel. stars are mainly for the service. The waitress was really nice so she made up for it. Food was ok. Both husband and I asked for medium rare and mine was a bit more rare. I don't mind it but still it should be consistent. My husband's was more cooked which he certainly didn't like. We switched our food but I didn't like the inconsistency which is key in steak. Also my baked potato was pretty average. No presentation and the toppings were just thrown on top of the potato. The potato looked pretty sad... :( loll. The complimentary bread was too hard (I know it was free, but still). Seemed like it was reheated too many times. Wine selection was good. Price was ok and ambiance was really nice. The decor was better than the keg which I noticed and liked. Lastly,  we felt the next day our stomach was a bit off. As we didn't eat or drink anything after the dinner and we both had this issue, I felt that there was something off with the food. It was nothing drastic so I didn't pay much heat to it. Just wanted to be honest and open in my review. Finally - kegs stays my go to place."}
