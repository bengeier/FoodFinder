{"text":"Chez Lien Plus is situated in the heart of Montreal Downtown on the intersection of Ste. Catherine and Stanley Streets which are always bustling with office crowds, university students, shoppers, sightseers and tourists alike. It's a BYOB restaurant and there's an SAQ just around the corner on St. Catherine street where you can buy your wine before going to the restaurant.

I'd recommend a reservation since it's a downtown restaurant and there are always groups of people waiting to get in. This restaurant is not pricey for a downtown BYOB but it is expensive in terms of the value and quantity of what they offer. Expect to pay around $25-30 per person for dinner (tips and taxes included). There's no corking fee so that's a good point. There was this absurd law which stated that either you have to finish your wine or leave it at the restaurant or something like that (dafuq???) but I've heard that they have changed it now and now you can leave the restaurant with your uncorked bottle with wine in it (Ha! first world problems)

I ordered some soup as entree and lamb-chops as the main dish. Both were passable. I mean nothing out of this world, not very bad either. Your impression would be that you're paying for eating in a restaurant in downtown and not for the food (it isn't extraordinary but it sure is expensive for what you get and if you factor in the BYOB costs, then actually you end up paying around $45). So why bother unless you've an absolute craving for Vietnamese food?
  
In all honesty, I won't go back there, not because the service wasn't good or the food was bad (both were ok), but because you don't get value for your money (not even abstract value like the pleasure of eating extraordinarily delicious good food or an excellent decor). Perhaps if you're in a rush or can't find anything else for a quick lunch, going to Chez Lien Plus might be a good idea, otherwise not."}
{"text":"- Vietnamese Restaurant with a modern french flare
- Bring your own wine- no corkage

Pros:
- Modern and Clean
- Delicious Food
- Close to the Sheraton Hotel
- Close to a SAQ wine shop at the end of the block on St.Catherines.

Cons:
- Sometimes service is slow

Recommend:
- Wontons with fried spinach
- Pork Chop
- Sitting on the patio during summer (the entire front of the restaurant is basically one large garage door)
- Eating there when not in a hurry
- A good place when you're not looking to have some PHo."}
{"text":"Food was not bad, price was on the cheaper side. I tried their veggie curry and was pleased to see lots of veggies. The curry was light; I usually like them richer. They served us fast, so for this reason, it's a good location to go downtown during lunch. I was not impressed by their service. First, they couldn't answer my questions about whether the soup broth and spring rolls were vegetarian and they took away my spring rolls without notice. This was upsetting because I wasn't done eating. They only accept debit, as an FYI."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was good, not great. Imperial rolls were very good. Ordered the shrimp Tom yam. Shrimp were not cleaned and overcooked, vegetable were the crinkle cut, frozen kind.. Not fooling anyone there. Overall ok food but way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  We just happened upon it in a hurry to find something not to far from our hotel and not too 'posh' as we were beat from our daily trek. It is a BYOB and had we known this we would have brought our own but were so tired it didn't matter. Folks who didn't know ran out to the local SAQ to get something they fancied. 

Service:  great!  Refilled our water on a regular basis, food was prompt and we were not left hanging at any time. 

Food:  we both had the meals that include soup or roll. The soup is fantastic. The broth perfect. For me I don't like cilantro so I took it out but other than that I rate it very high. I had the crunchy noodle veggie dish with chicken. The noodles were like a basket of them fried and everything put inside. The sauce was enough to meld it all together. The veggies perfectly cooked and still crunchy.   My hubbie had a breaded chicken that was so beautifully tender it was surprising. 

Price:  you can't beat it for dinner.   Easily less than $20 per

We strongly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"I expected really terrible downtown lunch food, but it wasn't half bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to return but I would avoid it either."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to eat there because the restaurant was empty. But it was freezing and I really wanted to eat Vietnamese. I got the chicken vegetable soup. Delicious and freshly made with grilled chicken and crushy veggies. Loved it! I hope they had more choices and more traditional vietnamese meals."}
{"text":"cute place tucked into a side street in montreals downtown. the food was good, not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but food. we had a table overlooking the street and a parking lot LOL. interesting aquarium with some funny looking fish. service was good, friendly, prices average."}
{"text":"Totally incredible pho. Broth (only beef, only or of pho) is phenomenal, beef and noodles are both outstanding. Bit unconventional in terms of the accessories (need to ask for non-metal spoon, limes, sriracha, chopsticks) but the place really stands out for an amazingly delicious and memorable pho experience :)"}

Retour au travail. Fringale du midi, je décide d'essayer, depuis longtemps, Chez Lien. Fine cuisine vietnamienne, bien présentée. L'entrée manque un peu de panache, je suis habitué à la cuisine vietnamienne bien plus spectaculaire :-) (Arômate d'Asie tu me manques...)

J'essaye le poulet Général Tao (version vietnamienne) .... Attention, de vrais gros morceaux de poulet dans une généreuse panure extracroustillante. BRAVO au chef ! Enfin, le premier restaurant qui a bien compris l'interprétation vietnamienne. Les chinois ont leur version. Oh ! Mais quel régal !!! l'assiette arrive, elle déborde de partout, ... un dîner.... apportez votre apétit ! Malheureusement, le riz n'est pas assez vapeur, il lui manque environ 5 min. de cuisson. Quand on cuisine depuis longtemps on sait qu'est-ce qu'un bon riz vapeur. De très bons prix, une carte table d'hôte midi, vraiment une belle découverte au centre-ville. La prochaine fois, je prends des photos, c'est trop beau :-)

Dans l'ensemble, on y retourne encore.

Back to work after the holidays. Noon hungryness leads to a place I've wanted to try for lonnnnnng time. Fine vietnamese cuisine, well presented. The apetizer lacks panache, I've been used to much more from vietnamese cuisine :-) (I miss you very much Arômate d'Asie...)

I decide to try the General Tao chicken (vietnamese version)... Oh Dear god, they have big chuncky size pieces of chicken, with extracrunchy batter. BRAVO to the cook ! Finally, the first place which has well understood the vietnamese interpretation of the dish. Chinese people have their own. What a feast !!! the plate comes on the table, it's full of good stuff, ... a lunch ... bring your apetite ! Unfortunately, the rice is a bite undercooked, 5 min. left in the ricer would have made it perfect. When you've been cooking for a long time, you know what is a good steamed rice. Good prices, honest prices, a table d'hôte menu, really great find downtown. Next time, I'll take pictures, it's too beautiful :-)

In the end, we'll see each other again."}
{"text":"Food is really good here. Great chicken off the grill and mouthwatering bbq beef. I had three dishes here and all of them were delicious. The food is always a hit. your bill will be around 20 dollars at least.

This place is a bring your own wine. This is great but dont think youll have that romantic date here. It gets crazy loud... maybe it was just the day I went (friday at 8pm) but people were screaming. Unpleasent."}
{"text":"Clean decoration , many tables , dishes are good, i'm satisfied. The dessert bananes and ice cream delicious."}
