{"text":"I would have given zero stars if it were an option. I live nearby and thought I would pick up a burrito to take to school with me for the next day.

When I went to eat it in the morning, I decided that I would like it to have some cheese. As I opened the tortilla a found a piece of a metal sponge on the tortilla. I let that issue slide and I ripped that piece of the tortilla off.

As I ate it later and fought the horribly over-cooked flavorless meat (I had also ordered the Green Chile Burrito per the employee's recommendation) I found A BUG inside of the burrito!!! I was so disgusted!! I have never had something like this happen to me before and I ignored the metal to only find something even worse.

I then called them to explain to them what had happened and they asked if I wanted another burrito. I refused the offer, because really, WHO would want to eat there after that?!? I told them that I was just calling to let them know what had happened so that they could be more careful and clean and then they HUNG UP the phone on me!!!! They wouldn't even take responsibility for this nastiness!!!

I paid $4.50 for the burrito and I left a $3 tip so that I could eat METAL and BUGS?!?  This has been my ultimate worst food experience EVER.

I HIGHLY recommend that you NEVER go here. Sorry guys, but you REALLY screwed up!"}
{"text":"Really great stuff.  Staff was even nice enough to teach me how to ask for mineral water as a drink in spanish."}
{"text":"If you have been drinking and just want a quick inexpensive fix for your hunger you cannot really go wrong with this place.  The folks are friendly and the food comes out quick and hot.  I have never ordered any of the plates as I always get the same thing:  carne asada burrito with pico de gallo and guac plus the three rolled tacos with cheese and guac.  I literally go down on it and don't come up for air until it is gone.  Is it gourmet?  Hell no but is it good and cheap?  Hell Yes."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected, wanted, and got!!  Came for a breakfast burrito and ordered a ham egg cheese and potato burro. It was cooked to order and I have no complaints with the food. The service was friendly and timely and the facility was clean. I wish there was a possibility of 3.5 stars because that's what this place deserves. I will be back for sure. I love breakfast burritos and I was very happy with this one. The red sauce was the perfect blend of flavor and heat to pair with my burro."}
{"text":"I saw the prior reviews but don't understand where these people are coming from as we've been here at least 5 times and have enjoyed the food, service and value each time.  The only explanation that I can provide is there may have been some inconsistencies due to this being a new location.  We've not experienced this chain previously so don't have that basis for comparison, but found the food to be authentic and flavorful.  Typically, we order take-out for home dining (with beer and margaritas!) so can't provide comment regarding onsite dining . We've ordered a variety of items like tacos and burritos which include their (shredded) beef and adobada, rolled tacos (=flautas), carne asado and huevos rancheros and enjoyed each dish.  We're planning our next order which may include pollo & chorizo (they'll accommodate special order requests) and tortas."}
{"text":"The prices are fair and I'm always full and disappointing in myself for eating so much when I leave so that means I'd go again. I'm just not sure how they're doing these days, I hate to say it but I worry if they don't much enough money their quality and cleanliness might fall and I'd rather assume that and not go then hope it doesn't and get sick. Over the years thanks to ASU West I've gone half a dozen time and I don't think I personally ever had an issue, I always get the super nachos."}
{"text":"The food at Big Burrito isn't that bad but they have a lot of work to do.  I cannot think of a reason to visit this establishment over the other Mexican fast food joints.

I ordered the enchilada and burrito combo with carnitas.  The pork was diced as opposed to shredded and it was not very tasty.  To their credit, though, the portions were fair and I did not leave hungry.

The folks do a good job of keeping the place clean which is not the norm at other places I've been to.

If you're already in the area and in need of nourishment, Big Burrito is not a bad option.  Just don't expect anything special.  It's edible."}
{"text":"Don't expect a clean welcoming environment or employees that can, in English, be courteous. But expect really good Mexican food and awesome \"specials\" prices. The specials are different on various week days. I like to go for their Monday $1/bean tostada days!"}
{"text":"The big burrito is a filibertos type joint that specializes in that drunk carne asada/rolled taco fair.  There used to be one on 19th and Dunlap.  I vaguely remember going to the one on Dunlap and thinking it was okay.  Of course, this was very late in the night/early in the morning.

The new one on TBird is where the Burrito Bandito used to be.  We ordered a carne asada burro, 3 rolled tacos w/ cheese, beans, guac, and cheese enchiladas.  The carne asada was disgusting.  It was marinated very poorly.  The flavor was bland and dull.  The meat was heavily chopped.  It was so chopped you could barely even make out it was carne asada.  The rolled tacos were covered in a waxy cheese glump.  Not sure what kind of cheese they used but it was basically a soft candle wax that clumped together.  The beans were so thin they were like applesauce.  The guac was average.  The cheese enchiladas were probably the best out everything but still no good.

I would have to say stick to big burrito on those late night/early morning runs only.  The food is no bueno."}
{"text":"They are no longer at that location n e more.... U can call the location and it just rings and rings... So we decided to go there. N it has a statement on the door that they violated their lien or something and it's completely empty. No More Big Burrito!"}
{"text":"this place is what gives mexican food a bad name.   the stuff tasted like it came out of a cafeteria after it was reheated.

i had to go to a taco-bell afterwards just to wash the taste out of my mouth.

with all the wonderful mexican food places in town, i dont know how this one stays in business."}
{"text":"Very typical mexican food. nothing special."}
{"text":"My first time I ordered a pink lemon aid, quesadilla, rolled tacos, and chimichanga. 

I had to throw the lemon aid out after one sip there was something seriously wrong with it.  Other food was just okay. 

I tried it again a week later for another chance. I ordered a machaca torta. It was good but bun needs to be toasted more cause it feel apart after a few bites and I had to eat it with a fork. 

Bean and cheese burrito is good but its hard to go wrong with that. 

Service is very slow for not that many customers in there. Durning lunch hour it took a friend 20 min to get her food. 

I will go back as they seem to be improving.  It's a new establishment and I think they are working out their new start issues. It takes time to get things running smoothly sometimes."}
{"text":"Ordered a Monterey burrito (carne asada, cheese and beans) husband ordered a big burrito (chile relleno, beans, rice cheese, guacamole, pico, and carne asada) we got both wet style. The enchilada sauce on top was disgusting! Super salty and gelatinous. Gross. How hard is it to make some real enchilada sauce or at least buy a good Cannes version. Carne asada was a grey color. No char marks or signs of quality grilling. Looked boiled. We both said our burritos smelled fishy and left with our hands smelling fishy. How was that possible with carne asada? Not going back. Should have listened to the other reviewer!"}
{"text":"The food is affordable and the breakfast burritos are pretty good. This spot is a good place to grab a bite if you're on the go and want something quick, but be aware no drive thru available. I would say that the burritos are above average in taste and average in price."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food for this type of joint. Super nachos are great. Staff is nice."}
{"text":"Somethin is off balance at this place.  I decided to pop in as it is right next to Taco Bell.  The picture of the Big Nachos or oh la la nachos, or whatever looked really good.  Why doesn't anything look as good as the photo ever.  Anyway it's just a hole in the wall, but they are friendly I ordered the nachos to go and got my order fairly quickly.  I got it home and was surprised......heavy stuff, I opened it and was amazed at how much food.  Here's the problem....flavor or lack there of it.  The beef had no flavor, lots of it, but no flavor.  It also did not have much cheese.  The guacamole also did not have much in the way of flavor.  I was very hungry so I ate alot of it, but I think some of these places including this one get the balance wrong.  The order doesn't have to be huge, it could have been 3/4 of the size, just make up for it in flavor.  I'm still a little surprised at how a Mexican food place like this could have little flavor.  Go to the coach next to Charlies on Camelback instead--their asad burritos are to die for."}
{"text":"Not good.  Fish tacos were over cooked and tough to chew and the only flavor you could taste was the tartar sauce (not good), even the beans were way too salty.  The search for a good fish taco continues."}
{"text":"There really isn't anything special about this place.  Your run of the mill fillabertos is tastier than this place.  I have been here twice now and am willing to drive the extra 2 miles to the burrito place over on bell rd.  If you have had real mexican food you will be a bit disappointed in the  bland menu and yellow cheese they use."}
{"text":"I must have poor taste when it comes to Mexican food based on the review below because I think Big Burrito is pretty damn tasty. Their carne asada fries are bomb and I'll come back for them time and time again.

Carne asada fries consist of carne, cheese and french fries. No sour cream, no guacamole, no bullshit - just meat, cheese and deep fried potato - fuck yes.

My boyfriend has gotten the rolled tacos (guac on the side) and he's also gotten the taco plate. Both of them have gone over well.

When you have a hankering for inexpensive mexican food and you're in the neighborhood, Big Burrito is a good choice. :)"}
{"text":"After having to move a block south last year due to the Light rail expansion, Big Burrito is now in the shopping center at 19th Ave & Northern, on the northwest corner next to Sprouts. 

This is our go-to breakfast burrito place on the weekends. I can get my Starbucks across the street while Nick runs over to pick up our burritos that we've already called in. 

We get the same thing everytime..I know how boring...but the egg, potato, bacon, and cheese burrito is just so damn tasty. Their green and red sauces are standard, but good. One burrito could easily be shared between two people, or maybe 2 women. I can never finish mine, but that's what I have Nico for. 

I stopped by last night and picked up a bean and cheese burrito and a cheese crisp. I love that fact that they grill the burrito for a minute after the wrap it up. The cheese crisp was not very crispy and was almost a little soggy by the time I got home. 

All in all, this is a great little neighborhood shop with friendly service and reasonable prices. 
If you live in this area, you should give them a try!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I have ever tasted. There is no flavor in the food whatsoever. I had a plate of carnitas, rice, beans with horchata.
The carnitas tasted like they were reheated as well as the rice and beans. No flavor. It only took 5 min for my orders (family of 3) to be ready. Not even worth trying out. Skip this place at all costs."}
{"text":"After browsing at the Bookman's next door, we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of tasty burritos.  We ended up getting non-burrito meals, but were fully satisfied with our entrees.  The green chile plate was filled with perfectly cooked pork with a spicy tomatillo sauce that went well with the pork.  The horchata tasted freshly made and was very refreshing and light.  Overall, I think Big Burrito is a good option for those that want a filling meal without breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"Needing a quick bite to eat, I thought I would try a new place in my very own neighborhood...big mistake!
I ordered the chimichanga plate and the beef burrito plate... the rice and beans were good, and they were generous with the guacamole (only plus), but it is what was inside that disturbed me... 
shredded beef, stringy onions, and canned tomatoes cooking on a stove in a pot for an entire day (maybe longer)... then shove that into both the beef burrito and the chimichanga... 
I don't think so!
Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great beans.. but I can get that at home from a can. 
Pass on this one, trust me. sigh..."}
{"text":"This was not good at all. I ordered fish tacos and I got a Vandeekamps fish stick in a tortilla with tartar sauce."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The soft tacos were big, which is weird.  Usually they are small and you have more of them.  Oh well."}
{"text":"The wife loves their chips, cheese and guacamole. I'm a fan of their super nachos. Super nachos are great but the price is high. I wish there was a bit less meat and it was $1 or $2 cheaper personally.

Overall this is a pretty decent take out Mexican place. And somewhere that I visit fairly often during board game night at the nearby game store."}
{"text":"This was my first stop at this establishment, and I liked it.  Went for lunch and had the combo of a tostada and beef taco (hard shell).  I thought it tasted pretty good.  I liked the beans, and the taco too.  Small place, fast & friendly service.  It appears that the majority of combo platters cost $6.99, and they are currently including a free medium drink w each combo.  There was a steady crowd when I was there, around 12:30 PM, so I figure that is a good sign."}
{"text":"This place has a disgusting smell when you walk in and then the food is just ok.  My husband and I had breakfast burritos, I have to say my bacon was crispy which was the only good part.  My husband had sausage and he ended up with food poising, so we will never go back."}
{"text":"Okay so I go in to get my enchilada on. I asked for ground beef and was loudly told \"no ground beef, only shredded.\" So I decided to get 1 chicken and 1 cheese. The cheese was not melted in my enchilada and the chicken was a pinkish color. I was somewhat worried about food poisoning. :( I will not be returning."}
