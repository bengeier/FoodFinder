{"text":"Will not be coming back to this place. Was passed over for service and a bigger table even when the sever had claimed \"this next big table is yours, let me just clean it.\" Rather another party comes in and immediately our promise was quickly changed to \"I'm going to push your table over to make room.\" 

I'm sure the service is excellent, if we were able to get any but I will be taking my money and time to other places in the area in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've have in a while. Fresh and very tasty!  Will definitely go back when visiting Toronto again."}
{"text":"The place was packed, Its an average place to chill with friends when you have plenty of time. 

We tried 3 Shishas - Paan, Grape mint, Guava - the first 2 were quite good and the Guava was average. The green tea pot came with hot water and tea bags so you will need to let it steep a bit.

The service was slow."}
{"text":"So my husband and his friends always end up at Haze lounge for their \"chill\" night out. I decided to change things up and recommended this place to them indifferent of the reviews that were on Yelp. 

We walked in my husband didn't see dim lights and his ghetto music playing (the ambiance that haze has) I batted my eyelashes and told him to give it a try. However, the place was very clean. We sat down and he began to loosen up. He order the chicken shawarma plate (comes with salad, rice and fries for $14) and I ordered the BBQ lamb wrap $8 (comes with fries and drink if you add $4) WE LOVED THE FOOD! It's well seasoned and good portion size. We also ordered the special shisha ($16) it was sooooo smooth and lasted till the end of the evening.  Bathrooms were clean. 

Now when it comes to service, once you get in just find a seat and sit, the servers will come to you. Although there were only two servers on that Friday night, they were  quick on there feet and the service was quick. I loved the honesty of the two young gentlemen servers that night, if you take the time to chit chat with them, they're hilarious. The music was a mix of Arabic and English ( mostly Arabic) it was a bit loud but that didn't bother me (you can always ask them to turn it down a bit) Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for good food and good shisha for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Was told by a friend of a friend to visit this place for shisha, but after my experience from last night, will not ever consider this place again. Upon entering, we had to hunt down a host to ask for a table as nobody was at the front. Afterwards, once we did get seated, they had given my party of four a small square table normally suited for a party of two. We were given menus, and were ready order some shisha and a bit of food and drinks as some people in our party were hungry. However, each of the four or five times our host/waiter had passed us by AND made eye contact and gestures, we were ignored to attend to people who had entered, or neighbouring tables.

When adjacent tables for four had opened up a few minutes after, we were informed that we could take those tables once they had cleaned it up, however for some inexplicable reason, it was given to a party of two ladies, instead of switching us up. Another table for four had cleared up minutes after, and once that had been cleaned up, we were asked if we could move our table over as to try and accommodate another 'large' party. After that last slap in the face, our party had felt insulted, completely disrespected, and we all promptly walked out the door."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very super friendly people and employees. Food was really good and fresh. 
Shisha was amazing and cheap. Cant find it for that price any more 10.99$. 
Nice decor. We ordered lots of food. Owner was very friendly and made sure we are ok. 
This is a spot you want to check it out if your in mississuaga. 
Thanks for the good service."}
{"text":"Ordered a shawarma through UberEats and it was absolutely gross! I found a huge chicken drumstick bone in my wrap! How the hell does that happen? Don't they carve the meat off the skewer? I actually chipped my tooth and had to visit the dentist the next day.  On a side note; the hommus and fries were tasty the next day but I'll never order anything from them ever again."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken shawarma for the price ($6), very flavourful! 
The service was amazing and super fast! 
Great place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a shisha lounge. We were seated in a table for 2 with a party of four. Then when we asked we were told as soon as a spot opened up for four it was ours, that was a lie. They seated everyone else repeatedly and then when a table opened up directly to our right for four. They seated a party of two there...and ignored us. The people to our left noticed and as they left told us to take the table. The staff then told us that they needed to clean it first and then proceeded to give it away even before cleaning and then telling us they'd have to move our table to make more room. Not move us to a different table. But move us with the table over. That was pretty much the final straw. Shitty service."}
{"text":"Excellent service, beautiful ambience. The food is delicious. Try their combo deals. I've been to other middle eastern restaurants but this place really ups the game. Even something like Hummus is so full of taste. The fresh juices are a must try. I felt so comfortable, the staff is so welcoming. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place lacks many qualities to qualify as a \"good restaurant/lounge\"
Service needs major improvements, unprofessional staff who would need a long time of training on how to treat and cater to customers.
The place is on the small side, so definitely not the right pick for a large group. Smaller groups can sit semi-comfortably even!

Shisha is \"okay\" for the non-smoker, but for a regular smoker, it's on the bad side unfortunately

All in all, it needs major improvements to compete with the many similar selections in the area"}
