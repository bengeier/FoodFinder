{"text":"This is where you get, in my experience, the best gelato in Montreal. Owner Vincenzo, always welcoming, serves the classics (nocciola is one of my favourites), but he also experiments -- e.g. Italian licorice (lovely), caramel salé (excellent) and even sesame. They serve a small selection of sandwiches for lunch. For those like me who don't live within walking distance, a visit here is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is the real thing. Reminds me of Italy. Tried the chocolate and hazelnut- delicious!"}
{"text":"Best gelato ever since we returned from Italia!!!
My favorite chocolate and hazelnut!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.
This is by far one of THE best places to grab gelato. Every flavour (yes, they offer a great variety) is decedent, so decedent in fact that you might have a hard time just choosing one! Although after your first visit - it's likely you'll want a second and third one, plenty of time to try different flavours. Their gelato is especially milky and sweet (but is NOT a sugar overload).

Small note that although there are small tables available, it is not a \"sit down\" type of place. Perfect for grab and go! A must visit(s)!"}
{"text":"My favorite gelato in Montreal! The staff (and Vincenzo) are all really friendly, a place to visit in Villeray all year long."}
{"text":"Meilleur gelato en ville! Point.
Gros faible pour le gelato aux noisettes et celui au café!
Un incontournable lors des journées chaudes d'été!"}
{"text":"Les glaces sont trop chères et les saveurs pas très recherchées (chocolat ou noisettes ou valille ou vanille et raisins...). Hier j'ai testé \"stracciatella\" un classique italien, grosse déception: crème glacée vaguement vaillée avec un coulis de cacao..., ce n'est pas ça de la stracciatella..., en tout cas pas en Italie ! Vraiment déçue :-("}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai mon blog (la boufferie), j'essaie de plus en plus de ne rien raté de ce qui ouvre dans Montréal. Donc, mardi dernier je me suis rendue Chez Vincenzo pour sa première journée. C'est un petit endroit (5-6 tables) qui offres des cafés, des paninis, des salades, des viennoiseries, des mignardises italiennes et du gelato! Évidemment, j'ai goûté toutes les saveurs qui étaient disponibles cette journée là (les saveurs changent assez souvent). Mes coups de coeur: Straciatella, biscottis et noix de coco. Je vous laisse découvrir les vôtres!"}
{"text":"Another great addition to Villeray!

I have had real Italian gelato many times, and this is the best I've had on this side of the pond.

The flavours change regularly, giving you the chance to try totally new flavours (sesame was one of the best i've had). The owner is super-friendly too."}
{"text":"I go to Italy quite often and I've had my fair share of authentic Italian gelato and, in most cases, mediocre gelato in Italy is pretty much on par with the best \"gelato\"  here. 

Chez Vincenzo is about as authentic as it gets in Montreal and it's certainly the best  I've had here.

My barometer is the Nocciola (hazelnut) flavour - most ice cream places here just can't seem to nail it and you're left with an odd powdery after-taste. Vincenzo's was creamy and delicious. 

If that's not enough of a barometer, my bf recently moved to Montreal from Italy and has been despairing over what we pass off as gelato here; he was pleasantly surprised by how authentic Vincenzo's was. 

The place itself is basically a small locale with a counter and a few tables but it was very clean and I loved the attention to detail as even the ice cream scoopers bore a familiar Italian ice cream brand logo. 

Vincenzo himself was very sweet and pleasant. He explained to us that he had studied the craft in Italy and was scrupulous about making his gelato as authentic as possible. 

I can't wait to go back and eat my way through the rest of the flavours!"}
{"text":"By far, my favourite gelato in the city. Flavours are perfectly balanced and the service impeccable. So happy friends recommended this place! I highly suggest the stracciatella, the chocolate-hazelnut, biscotti flavours, but honestly everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"Je déménage bientôt dans Villeray et il me fallait goûter le café au coin de ma rue! Petite place sympa avec café, gelatos, et il me semble avoir vu quelques pâtisseries...
Le latté est très bon, et Vincenzo très sympathique! J'ai hâte d'y retourner cet été pour goûter les gelatos!!"}
{"text":"Petite place sympathique, au décors moderne avec quelques tables. On y sert surtout du café et du gelato maison typique italien avec des saveurs etonnantes. Personnelement j'ai bien aimé l'explosion de saveur très originale mais c'est trop gras et sucré à mon goût. Je recommande la petite portion, a moins d'etre un fan de gelato!"}
{"text":"I must admit I am not the sweet tooth in the family. My wife, and kids love gelato and ice cream. I do love it but if I'm going to have gelato or ice cream it really has to be good. In Montreal this is the best gelato and I enjoy it regularly. In fact, I even suggest it sometimes. This is the closest thing in Montreal to my memory of being in Florence enjoying gelato 3 times a day. And Vincenzo, the owner is often there pouring his passion into the gelato. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Hooray!  Real Italian gelato exists in Montreal!  One of the things I always miss about Italy is the heavenly gelato.  I had yet to find a place here that even comes close to replicating it until I found Chez Vincenzo.  Now whenever I start to miss that gelato I need only head on down here to sooth my cravings for it.

They have a pretty decent selection of flavours for you to choose from.  On this particular visit I went for white chocolate and tiramisu.  It was wildly delicious and reminded me a lot of what you get in Italy.  It was the ideal treat for a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon.  My only minor issue with the place was that they didn't have cones when I went.  I always prefer eating my ice cream in cones.  Perhaps they had run out when I visited?  Anyways the gelato was awesome and I will be back to try their other flavours."}
{"text":"Sérieusement, les meilleurs gelati de Montréal. Les arômes sont authentiques et variés. Les viennoiseries sont aussi délicieuses. Et la cerise sur le sundae : l'accueil et le service sont hyper chaleureux. Coup de coeur pour le gelato à la prune, qui donnait l'impression de croquer à belles dents dans un fruit mûr et juteux."}
