{"text":"On the multiple occasions that I have gone to this restaurant, I have always had a positive and very-filling experience.   Their bread is delicious and hot. The server always brings out tons for us. I would say most of the dishes are standard Italian fare. I have not been disappointed by the Pasta Bravo, Eggplant Parm, or the side salads.  The best thing I have tried here was the Chicken Scaloppini. The chicken is covered in melted cheese and has a great lemon sauce. I would highly, highly recommend this dish.  For dessert, try the apple turnover thing with ice cream. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"No wait for a seat, sat right down.  We eat fried ravioli for app.  Very good.  I usually try to have some kind of pasta with shrimp, very very good.  My wife had the whole grain pasta.  She said you order for me, I made the right choice, she was very satisfied.  We valleted the car.  It was very comfortable.  The atmosphere very pleasant.  We had Paris for a server.  She took very good care of us.  I suggest, if you have not been there, give it a try."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty stellar. It is located right outside the Northlake Mall. It was raining and cold and we were doing a little shopping New Years Day. We decided to grab a bite to eat because I was craving spaghetti and they have complementary valet parking. Sweet! I love the decor. It has a warmer feel in my opinion then an Olive Garden. They were busy but we sat right away. Our waiter was great. Very attentive.   I hoping for a thick marinara sauce on my sketti but it had a light yet chunky sauce. It had a lot of flavor. I'm not complaining. It was Delicious. I was just hoping for a \"traditional\" like mama made kind of sauce. But like I said it was still fantastic. One of the things I really liked was the thinner pasta almost angel hair but not quite.   I am a real fan of this place. The prices aren't bad either. Absolutely check it out if you are in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I ate here over the weekend and ordered the Salmon Pasta. I had some changes to the dish because of a nut allergy. It is origionally made with a Pesto sauce which has pine nuts. KUDOS to them though for making Pesto be way it SHOULD be made....WITH the pine nuts. So many places omit them and STILL call it Pesto. Sadly, I can't have it the traditinol way. They accomodated the change without issue AND cooked my Salmon to order (medium).  For dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake. PERFECT end to my meal!  My server was excellent and attentive. The atmosphere was inviting. A great evening!!!"}
{"text":"I've always have a good meal here. The pricing is reasonable and a wide variety. Wait staff is hit or miss, sometimes on it."}
{"text":"Visited Bravo twice during a recent trip to Cleveland and both times the food, drinks, dessert and service were excellent.  The portions are large and the quality of the food was very good.  There are several sister restaurants in the area but the Eaton Square location is bustling and busy.  The pasta dishes we had were all fresh and cooked perfectly.  This is a great place to meet up with friends and family to enjoy the vibe as well as the menu."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was good but had shrimp rather than lobster meat. Buttery/fat tasting. Give it 3 stars.   Chicken Marsala was good lunch portion. Give it 4 stars.  Yukon Gold mashed potatoes were excellent. Give it 5 stars.  Green Beans were raw even though they had grill marks on them. I don't like raw green beans. Give it 1 star.  Waitress was very good to put up with me. Give her 5 stars."}
{"text":"PROS: Seated promptly after we arrived in a Sunday evening at 5:30pm. There seemed to be a wait closer to 6pm that day.  The noise level is not out of control. My dinner-mate and myself didn't have any issues hearing eachother. Bad acoustics can sour a meal.  The margarita pizza is decent, definitely not the best I've had, but I'd consider getting it again as there are not many vegetarian choices.  They will make some substitions to accommodate vegetarians.  CONS: We weren't the only ones that noticed how chilly the temperature was inside.  They don't have many healthy-ish vegetarian options. Pasta Primavera anyone?"}
{"text":"Not if you want real Italian.  The Chicken Parmesan had to be frozen and deep fried with cheese on top.  Sauce was cold and surrounded the pasta and chicken instead of on top.  Someone should get whacked for the quality and presentation of this food."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The bread seemed stale. It isn't crusty, it's crunchy, like crackers, or like stale bread. My wife and I don't care for sun-dried tomatoes so we didn't like the dipping oil, but others might? I had the Italian Wedding Soup and that's what it tasted like, so I'll give it a good. Also had the Roast Chicken Salad. Salad part was good, chicken part was not. Like a plain (not even seasoned) roasted chicken that they skinned and then put back into the oven to remove all moisture. Wife had Lobster Ravioli, which we both gave a \"meh\".  Just not much flavor to it and the lobster wasn't strong enough to overcome the lack of anything else. My son liked his spaghetti and meatball. I tried the meatball and it was good, but way over-salted. My daughter had the chicken parmesan which was also pretty good and the size of an adult portion. For reference the chicken parm was at least twice the size of the spaghetti in case you have hungry kids.  Generally, the food was ok, but average to the point that I won't go back.  Edit: I've definitely had focaccia before. And I've definitely had stale bread. And now I've definitely had stale focaccia. This is place is average at best. Bread or no bread."}
{"text":"As many times as I've been here I've never had such bad service as today. I sat outside because the weather was great, but was pretty much forgotten for most of the time. Why are the bartender's taking tables? Of course they can't attend to their tables properly because they are supposed to man the bar.  Secondly, if you change waitresses that doesn't mean I want my check. I was just disappointed today because I was neglected the entire time. I also didn't get bread, extra plates or a napkin under my drink like usual. What's the issue today?"}
{"text":"Apparently chain restaurants can be good.  Who knew?  Bravo is probably the best food available in the suburban gloom surrounding the Pittsburgh airport, which, yes, hardly sounds like an endorsement, but I mean it in the best way.    I was pleased with my meal here from start to finish.  The atmosphere was slightly kitschy, but I like that sometimes; it reduces stuffiness.  Service was attentive and friendly, without being overbearing.  The wine selection was sufficient for my tastes, and I think it would be more than enough for most rural Pennsylvanians.  Dishes came out at just the right time, every time.  The menu contained several vegetarian entrees, two of which I tried and enjoyed.  The food itself was very good--certainly not the best Italian food I've ever tasted, but surprisingly tasty nonetheless.  Flavors were well-balanced and portions were generous.  If you're in the area (and you probably won't be, unless you stay in a hotel nearby) and you're craving some real food, definitely check out Bravo."}
{"text":"favorite restaurant in south hills Pittsburgh  try crab cakes with poached eggs for brunch on sunday - awesome  kids can never finish their food - too much food with healthy sides  excellent service and very good quality food"}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant.  I've never had a bad meal here, and the portions are large.  The lasagna, while slightly pricier than the other standard pastas, is huge.  My dad has a big appetite and usually orders that one.  They also rotate daily lunch specials, so check that out on their website.  Just a heads up -- make sure you sign up on their website for their email list!  Just for signing up, I got a free appetizer, which we used for a delicious shrimp platter.  It was so good that my mom's considering ordering this instead of a real entree next time.  For your birthday, you get a free entree (with a generous timespan during which you can use it)."}
{"text":"One star is more than they deserve. Went three times over the years and left disappointed every time. Small portions, high prices, poor service. The waiters/waitresses are assigned TOO many tables."}
{"text":"Came to Bravo with the family just because my mother said that the bread sticks were to die for, they weren't. The food was ok and so was the atmosphere. I'm giving it a three stars just because it's a chain restaurant (which I didn't know) and I didn't like the service that much. I'm definitely going to give it another shot! Try everything twice like Andrew Zimmerman says."}
{"text":"Out of meatballs!? Our first visit was on Sunday, right as the restaurant opened.  I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs, only to have our waitress come back to the table and tell me they were out of meatballs.  What Italian restaurant is out of meatballs, especially when the restaurant just opened!? Aside from that, the food was okay.  My son got a kid's meal pizza, and the portion was as large as an adult size.  My husband really liked his dish.  Mine could have been better, but maybe I just had a bad taste in my mouth from the meatball situation."}
{"text":"A friend and his wife were at the Pepper Pike  Bravo on 3/10 for dinner. A $100 Italian dinner for two with two glasses of wine and two beers is not cheap. I would call it on the high side for middle level quality. They were happy enough with the food. The table setting looked as though the staff was never trained. Their server seemed to be bucking for a promotion. The rest of the staff congregated at the server's station. The dining room floor had multiple napkins, silverware, food in several areas, as well as several tables were not bussed. Moving outside to the patio. The loud traffic can't be dealt with. But again there were several dirty tables and the messy ground. Where was the manager? Does anyone walk through? The staff wasn't taught to pick up. I guess they weren't taught at home either. If the front of the house is like this. What does the back of the house look like?"}
{"text":"Encore wasn't bad, not sure why they closed, was kind of disappointed; they were fairly priced and had good food; but I was even more disappointed to see what sprout up in its place. I am not sure how they renovated that space and ended up making it smaller. It's like dining at your tacky, single Aunt's (or cross-dressing uncle from Miami) gaudy two-bedroom home---the plates even have the name imprinted on them---as if I could forget. The dish I ordered lacked any sort of presentation and I was incredibly underwhelmed by the taste. But at least they had the decency to take an hour to bring it out, ensuring that I would be hungry enough to eat just about anything they whipped up and slung at me. On top of everything else that managed to disappoint, they are yet another new business in Ballantyne that is ridiculously overpriced. If I ever go back to this slipshod of a restaurant, it will be because the pod-people won."}
{"text":"When I crave a certain food I become a lost puppy in search of the perfect meal. Today that craving was Italian food and overall I had an okay meal. My experience was neither excellent nor disappointing.   The restaurant decor is beautiful and I'm a sucker for places with a high ceiling. Our service was quick, almost too quick? I did not have any time to revel in the surrounding or have conversation. The point being is that I felt like a number and a turnover rate for them.   For the appetizer we opted in for the chicken bacon flatbread, which was delicious! An ideal combination of savory and crunchiness. I do recommend that. I had the lobster bisque for the soup and it came out very salty. For the entree I had the sausage tortellini. It was an excellent tasting meal but the portion size seemed small. It's possible that my expectation is Olive Garden portions but for most people the portion was probably ideal."}
{"text":"Great service by Ivan. Outstanding appetizers and desserts. My kids love this place which is rare. The crispy shrimp appetizer is so good also."}
{"text":"I went to Bravo last night and It is probably one of the best Italian places in town. I had the Chicken Milanese which is like chicken Parmesan and it was truly delicious for dessert they brought out a tray of desserts and we shared their tuxedo chocolate cake. Also they are pretty affordable for their upscale feel they have. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Italian food. The only bad thing I have to say is some not all of the servers are inexperienced but I'm sure that will change with time."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. I haven't had an opportunity to try the food, but have been waiting for over 45 minutes on a quiet Tuesday with open tables. No updates or apologies given. Terrible customer service!!!! Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Let's start with the incompetent management who cannot keep track of reservations made for dinner parties. Not only did they falsely cancel our reservation at the last minute but didn't attempt to accommodate our party of 50 when we decided to stay and wait. We waited almost 2hours to be sat and served. Most restaurants would have a)tried to seat us immediately 2)offered beverages 3) some kind of discount or comp for the inconvenience on part of their mistake. The service was mediocre at best. We had a few servers working the party. Our particular server (maybe her name was Alicia) had a bad attitude and did not care to offer her best service to an already horrible experience. The food was average but certainly not worth the time, money, or frustration. As a waitress myself, I've never worked with management who would have handled guests the way this restaurant did. I would never recommend this place and quite frankly would never step foot in this establishment again."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!! Arrived at 8:00 ordered, never received food until 9:00. Waitress complained about the table next to us complaining so that was why she couldn't get to us???!!! No water offered, had to go to bar to get our own drinks. At 9:35 my husband finally asked bartender for check. Complained to manager, he was nice enough, said he wished we would have come to him earlier.  I told him to read my Yelp review. We never saw the waitress again. We drove over an hour to come to this Bravo. Friends of ours said it has gone down hill, but we USED to love it. Never going back and we will spread the word! The food was decent, would have been better if we would have been offered cheese for our pasta dinners. First time at ANY eating establishment that we were this disappointed. McDonalds would have been better!"}
{"text":"When I visited, it was very quiet and the atmosphere was comfortable. Even though the menu does not seem to have vegan options, the waiting staff was very kind and understanding, and the kitchen altered dishes with no problems. I had eggplant, tomato, and spinach on  whole wheat penne with a balsamic vinegar-white wine reduction sauce."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with Bravo last night. I haven't been there for awhile and they have changed the menu and apparently the cooking. I doubt if I will ever return, my pasta was really, really bad.. I noticed the place was almost empty, it used to be jammed packed and one had to wait to be seated, there seemed to be more staff than diners. I guess others have noticed the change in the food and menu and are not returning. I will say the server was pleasant and efficient, but that does not make up for bad food. Sorry Bravo, but it's \"Arrivederci\" . You were one of my favorites, but no longer."}
{"text":"I have been going to bravo on mcknight for years! I typically dine there for lunch, there are many wonderful servers, but Sherri is the server I know the best! she is AMAZING! Everytime I come in she waits on me, and always has a smile.. I will continue to dine there because of the friendly staff and the delicious food!..The best is the Romano chicken salad!!!"}
{"text":"I love Caesar Salads and have been ordering them for years at all kinds of restaurants.  I've self-appointed myself  a Caesar Salad expert and am writing to say that the CS I had at this Bravo Restaurant at the Galleria last night was F A N T A S T I C."}
{"text":"My first visit, my husband's enjoyed dinner here with colleages several times.  We enjoyed our meals and were pleased with the flavor of both the tilapia topped with crab and shrimp and the crab and shrimp cakes. The roasted veggies were tasty and my husband enjoyed the crispy potatoes.  Service was friendly but empty soup crocks never left the table until the end of the meal.  We both tried unfamiliar wines and enjoyed the Travolo red and the  Reisling."}
{"text":"We came for dinner for my sister's 80th birthday. We were a group of 10. The service was over the top! Our waiter, I think his name was Pete, was wonderful and we are a difficult group. My dinner had to be made separately without pepper and he didn't bat an eye.  My nephew wanted something that was caffeine free and sugar free, but not water. They didn't have a soda that fit that request so someone went to the store and bought a six pack of sugar free ginger ale and kept his glass full all night.  The valet parking was an added delight and all of the food was delicious.  I'm not usually a big pasta fan, but I couldn't get enough of theirs.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a terrific dinner and a great dining experience. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Italian chain restaurant out there.  The creamy parmesan dressing is delicious with any salad.  My favorite meal is their veal parmesan and they serve real veal which is hard to find at any chain but every time I've eaten it, it has been perfect.  Lastly, if you like cheesecake make sure you try the creme brûlée cheesecake."}
{"text":"great place for lunch, service was fast and food was delicious."}
{"text":"First time visitor.  My wife and I frequent restaurants and we were blown away from start to finish.  The ambience was very relaxing.  The food was very well prepared and presented.  The staff was memorable.   Our server, Maleah, was so attentive and gracious. She made our visit personal and we so enjoyed her warming smile.  If your looking to get away for a quiet evening this is the place to go.  Thank you."}
{"text":"The two worst meals of my life were at this restaurant.  Tomato \"soup\" so thick and sticky my spoon nearly stood up in it, salad without dressing which I asked for when I could find anyone on the wait staff and they never brought--repeatedly.  Overcooked rubbery eggs for breakfast with cold potatoes and toast.  Nope.  Fool me twice.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Nothing special. A place to go to pretend to eat good, real Italian food. Upscale Olive Garden. Service was horrible. Asked for a gluten free menu. They never brought it out. Order Caesar salads. They all came without the dressing for some reason. Pasta was cold and looked like it had been sitting around. Way better Italian places to eat. Skip Bravo."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a skillfully prepared (al dente)  Mediterranean pasta and excellent cappuccino outdoor under an umbrella. Very warm and helpful staff. Only 4 stars because the chairs are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Don't ever order here- after driving all the way to pick up my order, they claimed not to have it and made absolutely no effort to fix the situation..."}
{"text":"I have been to this spot a number of times over the years and I have to say that everything from the food to the service has seen serious declines. We had dinner there last night and our poor experience started with the non-greeting from the hostess. Our table was not ready, but was in just a few minutes, so we went to the bar. Again we were ignored by the bartender and got curt service when we were finally served. Upon being seated, the poor service continued. It took almost half an hour for a bottle of wine to be delivered to the table, multiple servers helped our apparently overworked waitress as food was delivered without the staff knowing who was getting what dish. In the past, non of these poor service situations would have been a part of the program. Once the food arrived, it was average at best. Many in our party did not finish their meals, the food was generally salty and tasted like microwave Italian out of the freezer. The one bright spot was the NY Strip that my son loved. It is just sad to see such a decline in service and food quality in this once fine establishment."}
{"text":"Expect less. Pay more. The motto Bravo should use. I can't say that I dislike all chain restaurants, but I certainly dislike Bravo. It's highly overpriced for the \"Italian\" cuisine they serve, yet, there always seems to be a two hour wait on the weekends. Every time I have eaten there, I always left with a light wallet and a mediocre taste in my mouth. I know I don't need to eat there, but I am a strong believer in second chances. After my latest meal, which was a grilled chicken chopped salad that was coated in salt, I am saying goodbye to Bravo."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was devine. Wine was excellent, a beautiful  red blend.  I would recommend this restaurant  to all my best  friends.  DEL"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! The bread and dipping oil is always delish. I really enjoy the soup (wedding) and salad ( instalta della casa) combo. The appitzer shrimp is yummy too but I sometimes get that as a meal. The service is so-so ,"}
{"text":"I like it because they are accomadating for large groups and take reservations. Our waiter had a bit of an attitude and you could see all  his face that he didnt want to be at work. Everyones food was fine. I want to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Went to Bravo for dinner last night. Definitely did not live up to any expectation of mine. For starters the website is advertising a summer special that is supposed to run till August 14th where you can get two courses for $16 or three courses for $20. We get there and the server looked dumb founded when I asked about the special. Then stated that there was a mistake on the website!!! My husband ordered the crab topped salmon and I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta as well as some drinks and an appetizer. It was an hour wait and all I ended up eating was bread!! I got so tired of waiting I asked for my food to go. Our appetizer came out wrong. Then when we got the bill we were charge $40 extra in additional food we didn't order. Got home to eat my food after I settled in and ended up tossing it. The shrimp scampi was not appetizing at all. Best thing I had from this place was the peach Bellini I ordered! Waste of money and waste of time. Better off going somewhere else where you get quality food and a great experience for your money. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. If you like Bravo and don't want to deal with the hassle, go to the Robinson location one.  My fiancee and I arrived at 5:50pm and were quoted a 60-70 minute wait. Long time, but no problem. So an hour and 10 minutes go by. We noticed a couple of young high-schoolers walk in, hugging the hosts and talking to them. Then, five minutes later, were seated. They were not given a buzzer like everyone else. This happened a few different times while we waited. So, after waiting slightly AFTER our initial time, my fiancee asked the hosts how much longer it would be- \"just a few more minutes, lots of tables are opening up.\" We waited for another twenty minutes, while people who had been there after us continued to get seated. Finally, an hour and a half after we had been waiting another lady who was waiting for a seat gave us HER buzzer because she found a seat at the bar. So, the only reason we were actually seated 30 minutes AFTER our quoted time was because someone else gave us their buzzer. When we walked up to the host stand with the buzzer, they looked at us, rolled their eyes, and waited another two minutes to get menus and seat us.   So then we were seated and we told the waiter our ordeal, because he had asked us how long we were waiting. We weren't going to hold it against him, it wasn't his fault. However, when we asked him for cherry coke, he just told us they had coke, without offering to put grenadine in it for us...I know the bar carries grenadine, however he clearly didn't want to make an effort to put any in for us.   So then we get our bread, without plates. Our waiter said \"Wow, it's like eating at an Ethiopian restaurant where you have to eat from a communal bowl.\" Then he walked away. Seriously, I cannot make this stuff up.   After using a small drink napkin as a makeshift plate, our house salads came. One of them came with dressing on the side, rather than already mixed into the salad per usual, which is not what we ordered. He said, \"Oh, I don't know why this is different, guess you'll just have to put it on the salad yourself.\" Again, this is for real people.  Alas, the manager came over and said, \"Sorry to interrupt you, I'm not going to lie, our kitchen screwed up your order. The chef asked me to come over and tell you that they have to remake the food and that he was sorry. So, sorry it is taking so long for your food, we screwed it up, but it's being fixed and should be out here soon.\" He didn't seem sincere, he acted like it was a joke to him. Silly us thought that he might have been aware of our previous inconveniences and had come over to apologize. We were so dumbfounded by his clear lack of awareness that we didn't think he had the mental capacity to understand  anything else if we were to explain it to him. He walked away and we decided to observe him. He is clearly the type of manager that is more interested in being the \"cool manager\" and goofing off, laughing with the hosts, than walking around and checking on the guests.  We eventually got our food, two basic pasta dishes, and left after five minutes from receiving our food. We were so exhausted from the whole ordeal that  we decided that it wasn't worth being at this poorly run restaurant any longer.  After giving us our bill, our server said \"thanks for being patient, please come back again.\" Honestly? Because you were so accommodating? No thanks. We actually had a bet going as to whether or not the hosts would stop talking to one another for five seconds and leaning sloppily on the host stand to say \"have a good night\" as we left, but alas my fiancee won the bet - they didn't say a word. We left, noticing that the time now was 8:30 pm.  Throughout the whole night, the chef won best customer service for us because he at least recognized he screwed up...and he doesn't even work directly with guests obviously!  This is seriously the Bravo from hell."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and neither time was a bad experience.  Last night we were seated right away and our service was descent. It wasn't packed by any means for a Monday night but they had a good crowd.  Our waiter was very friendly, however, my only gripe was it took a long time in between his stops to check on us but we overlooked it.  The bread and oil is delicious. I think I ate about 7 pieces of bread! I stayed with the Wedding soup and Caprese Salad. The Wedding Soup was good but I think only had one meatball :-( The Caprese Salad was very fresh. The mozzarella cheese and tomatoes tasted like they just received them. They had a balsamic glaze over top which was very tasteful and a nice touch. Recommend."}
{"text":"As Chi-Chi's was to Mexican food, so is Bravo to Italian food. That is to say, it's garbage food with Italian names."}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit. The other three were good. This visit was for a birthday dinner.  The service was horrible. The management did not resolve the issues well. She said she'd comp a few meals- but still charged for some of them. We were pretty much ignored.  Not to mention, they couldn't figure out where to seat us and honor our reservation. They look visibly flustered. I could go and on."}
{"text":"I dont like bravo. there are better italian chains. this time i orderd the gnocchi and scallops. the gnocchi was not sauced enough and then it was totally overcooked. my co-workers chicken was undercooked. i guess what annoyed me the most about this place was that we made a reservation for 10 ppl and made us arrive at 5pm promptly or they could not guarantee a table. only to find that it was completely empty when we arrived, granted still early for dinner....but even when we left two hours later....the restaurant wasnt even half full. it could have been a staffing issue. overall, olive garden does it better, and carrabas does it way better."}
{"text":"The decor is absolutely lovely.  Instead of Olive Garden's rustic country look, we have Rome, with columns and marble.  The ceilings are high, the lighting just right, and an extensive line of very tall french doors on two sides with cheerful black-and-white awnings outside lets in lots of sunlight in an elegant way.  Totally suitable for a wedding rehearsal dinner, a business dinner,  parents coming into town, or a date where you want a little more light on your table than you get with Carrabba's.  Bravo! is well-suited for the handicapped, since the tables are high enough to accommodate the controls of a powered wheelchair.  Elsewhere, like Olive Garden, lower tables are too low for the controls to go under, so this requires an awkward angled seating position for the person in the chair, making it difficult to eat.  Yea, Bravo! for getting it right.  Service was gracious, fast, and attentive.  We arrived around 11 a.m. on a weekday and were apparently the first ones there.  As noon approached, the restaurant filled up significantly.  Our host was welcoming and helpful in making sure mom's wheelchair was able to go where it needed to go.  Our server was a very pleasant young blond woman with a smooth ponytail who supplied us with helpful suggestions, kept our glasses filled, and did everything we wanted timely.  No complaints here!  The food had high and low points.  By comparison, Carrabba's is the dark grotto with the really, really rich food hot and fresh off the grill and always delish.  My fave.  Bravo! was lighter and in some ways more interesting. but also less consistent. This was our first time here, so we requested and got lots of suggestions from the waitress.  The salads were more interesting than those served by their competition.  We ordered the chopped Italian salad and the rustica salad.  The latter has a really impressive appearance, lots of \"stuff\" on it, and a pleasing sweet dressing that tasted homemade.  The chopped salad looked smaller and more ordinary but had a very light, pleasant, fresh flavor.  Yum.  My entree, a chicken-over-ziti dish, was disappointing.  It obviously sat under a heat lamp for a while and got dried-out.  They are apparently economizing on the sauce quantity, since there was not enough sauce for the ziti to capture any at all in the hollow centers; I requested extra sauce (unusual for me), they supplied a small extra metal vessel of it without complaint and without extra charge, and that was enough.  Fresh tasting.  I could do as well at home for far less money, though.  Mom had the lasagna, which was cheesy, good, and generously portioned.  For dessert, there was creme brulee, which was freshly made and which she really liked.  She actually ate all the lasagna leftovers at home that night.  Very unusual.    Overall, the bill was higher than we would have liked but reasonable for such a beautiful setting.  I still prefer Carrabba's, but we look forward to revisiting Bravo! when we come to Northlake Mall in the future."}
{"text":"Beware of the Spaghetti and Meatballs, I got the worst food poisoning from here. Will never go back."}
{"text":"--- There is nothing Italian about this franchise chain--- Food is mostly with some tomato sauce base that is acidic. Many of the dishes are heavily loaded with tasteless, texture less pasta likely made from dried preprocessed material. --- Why is it that many of their sort of restaurant claim to be Italian, when many of their entrees are not? --- Chicken strangled in pasta is a disgrace to Italian cuisine!!! Chicken is not a garnish. Pasta is not a side dish. No discussion.--- Perhaps a small measure of redemption is some of their pizza, which surprisingly is well seasoned with the right proportion of cheese."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great!!!  The new menu items sounds so yummy, but it just doesn't deliver.  Its bland bland bland.  Tastes like a frozen meal i could just heat in microwave.  My pesto pasta with chicken was such a disappointment--my husbands spaghetti was bland as well.  The the price of entrees, the nice atmosphere, the friendly service--why isn't the food better?  Save your money and make pasta at home."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, and the server was very attentive and helpful.  The only negative, and I have seen others make this same comment, is the portions for the price."}
{"text":"The braised beef ravioli butter sage sauce and sweet potatoes is magic. Most of the staff are good but some servers are terrible ( rude, slow, gets orders wrong). But there are a few friendly attentive ones. It's hit and miss.    Bathrooms are good but the cleaning solution makes the floor sticky. It is clean I think just not rinsed so it's sticky.   Not sure if this bugs other people but their shirts are white and you can see every detail of some of the ladies under garnets. I really don't want to see your leopard print!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain. Yes, the decor is just-this-side-of tacky.   However...  They do a good Sunday brunch we've found!   Not wanting to go the diner route, we said \"why not' after learning that Sara's does not do brunch on Sunday.   The crab cake eggs  benedict was quite good, the bloody mary only so-so. The frittata at the table next to us looked tasty. Most dishes come with some fried potatoes that are a tad too grease-ola for my taste. Brioche toast is available as a side, however they did bring a nice little bread basket.  There was no wait for  table, service was quick, food came quickly and it was relaxing enough to scan a newspaper and chat in peace. I refuse to endure a long wait for either a table or food at Sunday brunch -- something so many of the other east side options suffer from.  I would NOT come to a place like this, by choice, for dinner -- but it is nice to know there's an easy brunch option in this area."}
{"text":"The first 2 times I went here it was awesome!  The last two times....bleh....service was slow and the food was sub-par.  I am not sure if I would go back for a third time...it's pretty pricey to be disappointed 50% of the time."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch special, the salad was delicious. Great atmosphere, made me feel I could stay there all day knoshing on olives and downing wine glasses."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, but the food(at least what I ate) lacked flavor. I had the calamari, that came with a sweet tartar sauce and a watered down marinara. For the main course I had the rigatoni melanzana. It was supposed to have eggplant, I think I found 5 pieces of eggplant in my bowl. Overall nice restaurant but I've had better."}
{"text":"I live close to this restaurant, but this is never someplace I think of going to. Every time I've been, the food has just been average. A friend of mine recently suggested we dine here, so I decided to give it another shot. I ordered the lobster bisque for my appetizer and the salmon as my entree. The soup was good, but I thought the salmon was mediocre. There wasn't anything special about it, and I wasn't a fan of the side it came with, which consisted of a little bit of greens and tons of tomatoes. I also thought the service needed improvement. Our waiter messed up or checks when we said we wanted them separate, so we ended up paying for each other's meals."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for my birthday this month and last month and it's always a wonderful experience here! The bread and olive oil and vinegar they bring you is delicious and tempting, and the flat bread and pizza is very delectable and delicious. The pasta is fancy and tasty. The environment is welcoming and pleasant. The tiramisu is a personal favorite of mine. The tables are large and can accommodate alot of people. They also have a nice outdoor area outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was easily one of the WORST meals I have had. Bravo was relatively decent when it first opened but it seems to have continually gone downhill since. Had dinner tonight with my husband. The bread they brought out was completely stale. Seemed like it was leftover bread they just reheated. I ordered the shrimp scampi. The pasta was a gelatinous pile that was completely inedible. The shrimp was gross and the crustini that came on the side was hard as a rock. If you want overpriced horrible Italian food, certainly feel free to dine there. Otherwise skip it."}
{"text":"waitress was not attentive and the food was not up to par despite all the good reviews it was not worth the time and the money"}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon with pasta for dinner. The presentation was alive but the flavor was dead. My salmon was grilled along with the asparagus and the tomatoes. If just tasted like it was grilled and that's it. My tongue was craving for flavor but never got it!!! I wasn't the only one that felt that way. Hint: season the salmon and use sun dried tomatoes instead. I gave a 3 stars instead of 2 because the service was decent."}
{"text":"This place is gross. Here for brunch and they're out of eggs. They keep their dessert tray on the divider between booths where someone leaning back would end up with their head in fake whipped cream. They also store their paper table cloth covers on the railings that run down the center aisle of the restaurant. I hate it here."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this chain restaurant. Staff and service was slow and food was definitely overpriced. Plenty of other great options in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"Rip off.  I had my last meal at Bravo.  Ordered Salmon Pasta.  3 bites of salmon & 4 strands of pasta.  Left starving.  Had to go home & eat.  My 19 year old daughter usually takes half her meal home.  At Bravo she cleaned her plate.  I know times are tough. But you can't cut portion sizes to the point the food is non existent.  My meal wasn't enough food for Michele Obama.  Yelp made me give it at least one star which is one more than they deserve."}
{"text":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT 1) over 65 minute wait for a table (told 45 minutes) 2) Booth #51 tabletop was disgusting...peeling black paint, bare wood. I have seen better tables at dive bars.   3) Took over 10 minutes for waiter to address us 4) Wet bread plates brought to us ...had to inconvenience our waiter to bring us dry plates 5) Staff complaining at our table \"I hate to bus big ass tables\" 6) Water empty twice and took too long to get refills 7) Braised short ribs raviolli was over salted and sweet potatos were undercooked 8) NEVER received requested refill on oil and bread 9) NEVER offered dessert 10) Took forever to get our waiter to actually bring the bill 11) Women's bathroom dirty B"}
{"text":"My experience here tonight was terrible from start to finish. First the hostess...my mom and I should of taken this as a sign and just left...but we chanced it. Walk in...hostess is starring at us like a deer in headlights...some awkward silence goes by and we say 2 please...hostess looks completely confused...so we add \"for dinner??\" and that finally prompts her to grab menus and seat us. Awkward,  but whatever. Now...onto our waiter who really brought home the 1 out of 5 star rating. Mr. Zero people skills or Mr. Unfriendly. Let's add a fun fact...this place wasn't busy at all...it was 7:45pm. Anyway...took him a little bit to come over...no biggie. We order our drinks. He brings them and takes off without saying I'll be right back or whatever normal waiters say. He comes back...i order margarita flatbread and a side salad. We've been here now for 20 minutes (been watching the time), still no bread and oil. So some time goes by...my flatbread comes out...just the flatbread...so I politely remind the runner I'm still waiting for the salad and asked if our waiter could bring bread and oil...first time asking. 10 minutes goes by and I get my salad from the waiter. I ask him for some bread and oil...with the salad. He says ok...hes waiting for it to come out of the oven...ok that's fine...but how are you about to sit at bravo for 45 minutes with no complimentary bread and oil???????????? Eat my flatbread...eat my salad...still no bread and oil. So...after that he asks if we want dessert..i politely decline...but ask for bread and oil...thats our favorite part. So we finally get it...waiter rudly sets down the oil across the table and walks off....so rude. No refils on our drinks either by the way. Then to top it off...get the bill...our waiter looks at it in front of us and sets it down. I look at it and it's wrong....charged us for 2 bowls of soup we didn't order. Bring it to his attention....no initial apology...just his rude shuffle away. He fixes it and brings it back...then says a mediocre sorry. This service was terrible to be mild about it. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Worst worst service I have ever experienced. We waited for 1.5 hrs for the food to arrive, the waitress was not interested at all at what she was doing! Will never go back!!  Update after a couple of weeks - the manager convinced us to give an opportunity for better service so went there last weekend. Earlier we had major complaints about the service so they made sure the best waitress was assigned to us. Since this was meant to correct the mistake, no wonder the service was good. Hope they follow the same with every customer."}
{"text":"Had the WORST experience....horrible service....wrong orders....took way too long....wait staff incompetent and cried.  Bills were wrong...coffee cold.....Never going back"}
{"text":"Service was very slow!   Had to keep asking.   Appetizers out quick then another hour before entrees.  Kids had ordered fries. Did not come ask waitress who Said do they still want.  Well yes they ordered did they not Food only marginal.    Chicken Marsala dry, burnt, little sauce  Next time diner somewhere"}
{"text":"It is so funny how chain restaurants work, we usually go to Brio's at South Park for dinner, bravo is their sister property in Balentine, they have an amazing patio however they have the worst service ever, the most greasy calamari ever, service is extremely slow, staff have absolutely no knowledge, the hostess is the best thing in that restaurants, The waiter that we had on the patio will talking and talking and talking to his friend next table to ours and was ignoring us the whole entire time knowing that we need beer, cocktails, he could've increased his check by at least 50 or $60  dollars. I would say they are the all of garden of that chain."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch with two teammates.   Our server (Mathew) greeted us immediately after being seated and was the perfect amount of attentive without being clingy.  He refilled our drinks regularly and without being asked.  He was extremely polite.  The food was good.  The rosemary bread that they serve before the meal was warm and very tasty.  I had the lunch special with a ceasar salad to start and stuffed shrimp scampi as the entrée.  The salad was delicious; a little more tart and fresh than a normal ceasar.  The shrimp was pretty good.  There are 4 stuffed shrimp to a lunch order and it was served with a bit of a vegetable medley and rice.  Overall, pretty tasty!  It isn't the cheapest place around but it is great for a business lunch."}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE!!!!!  We were there on a Wednesday.  We arrived around 4:15.  It was NOT crowded.  You would have thought there was not a seat to be found. We had to wait for a table!  The service was extremely slow.  One of my children asked if we could have bread.  The waitress said she would come back and fill our water glasses.  That happened when we were finished with our meal.  Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the food was okay."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning here... Like currently throwing up the lobster ravioli. Everyone who was in my party is very ill. Food and service were okay. But could never return to this location. Ugh."}
{"text":"My family and I go there all the time, and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal there. Very  consistent. The staff is always friendly and the manager always comes by to ask how everything is. I normally get the Filet Tuscano as my entree, and it's always cooked to my liking. After the bread, salad, and steak I'm usually stuffed. However, I would never miss out on the Berry Cake. It is the best dessert I've ever had, period! The combination of warm cake, vanilla bean gelato, and fresh berries is fantastic. I only wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Pros-  food was delicious, place was clean and at least one waitress heard us singing happy birthday and joined in.  Cons- there were many waitresses just standing talking in the corner leaning against the wall. Our party got there at 7:30 and we didn't have ample bread until 8:30pm. The food was served at 9.15.  I don't mind waiting for food but at least refill the drinks, we took turns hunting our waitresses down!!  The manager came out after we had been there for almost 2hours, helped hand out salads and didn't even introduce herself?! We guessed she was since she was dressed differently? The place was empty yet we barely got any attention!  If we were in a cheap restaurant or if it was during peak hours I would understand the crappy service but for a Wednesday night with barely any people in there and with such high prices?...Inexcusable!"}
{"text":"I went to the Robinson location with a group of girl friends on Tuesday Feb 28th.  The food and service were just perfect.  Mark and Kelly did a great job keeping up with all of us even thought we had a large group of around 18.  We could not have had a better experience!"}
{"text":"Food was not as I've had at other Bravos. Poor service. Thumbs down for this location."}
{"text":"i went here for lunch on the weekend with no reservations and was seated quickly. The drinks were good, especially the raspberry tea. The bread served with olive oil was very good. The pasta and chicken was okay. The only disappointment was the cheesecake dessert which took a while to be served and came caramelized, which was terrible."}
{"text":"Quick response from the General Manager.....I believe he is sincere and passionate about the business and will take appropriate action to resolve the issues we experienced!   Based on the food and the General Manager responsiveness to the issues, we will give the restaurant another chance.  Just in case you are wondering, we will do this on our own, without any freebies or enhancements from the restaurant."}
{"text":"For a chain, Bravo is a cut above the norm  We arrived late at the Pittsburgh airport, consulted Yelp for spots still open, and decided on this Italian chain.  We found the wait staff to be cheerful and eager, even after what they described as a hard night. Two of us found multiple dishes we'd like to try; one was in a picky mood. The rosemary infused bread was delish, although the olive oil dip was too bland.   I enjoyed the shrimp diovola with a chopped salad starter, while another party member was very pleased with the pesto tortellini. Picky eater wanted the steak/shrimp combo and discovered that he could get the lunch-size version at a reduced price. This also was very good, although his Medium steak definitely was Medium Well. Overall we found Bravo to be a nice mid-point between Olive Garden and a true family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Dined at bravo tonight, our waiter John was exceptional very attentive, my shrimp scampi was excellent would dine with them again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Bravo Cucina Italiana is a favorite of mine. I have enjoyed meals in many and this one is no exception.  Fine foods and outstanding service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love Bravo.... HOWEVER, if you are a dessert person, (a la Cheesecake factory), you may be disappointed.  it is not about the quality; it is about the quantity;  ESPECIALLY how the ice cream (gelato) is served.  it is as if someone went to munchkin land to get the smallest scoop they could find, can't \"scoop\" because of weak wrists, and is miserly as well!  I ordered the warm cookie blondie - full size - it came with 2 average (on the smaller size) blondies with an almost invisible \"scoop\" of ice cream.  I laughed!  now, was it good? absolutely!; did i feel as if i had dessert? not really, especially when compared with other restaurants including Fish Market (luscious ice cream pie) and Cheesecake (the place to go if you really love desserts)...  for the price and the quantity, well let's say I was just disappointed. . . please, manager,  up size your desserts (especially the gelato). . . then Bravo will be the best of the best."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for an early dinner. Our sever was great.   We got italian wedding soup that was amazing. I got the turkey cucumber sandwich. It was really good however there was mold on the bottom of my bun. The server took it back and the manager made me a new sandwich and took it off my bill.   We were seated near the restrooms and anytime someone went into the men's restroom we got a strong whiff of urine. It was gross. Not sure I will be back at this location."}
{"text":"Food is 4/5. Service is 5/5. Nice quiet professional casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Four of us went here on Friday night around 6:00pm. We told the host that we wanted to have a drink at the bar and then have dinner. He bluntly stated that we better keep an eye on the door because he wouldn't save a table for us. We didn't think it would be a problem, so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I enjoyed the Pomagranitini and the others had martinis. As we finished our drinks, I went up to the host and asked for a table. He asked for my name, smugly handed me a \"buzzer\" and said that it would be 25-30 minutes. I noticed that my name was the only one on the list, I looked around and no one was waiting. It looked like there were some tables available so I was very puzzled. I went back to my friends and we agreed that we would rather spend our money next door at Firebirds where we have always been treated well. When my friend told the host, he just shrugged and said okay. I was very disappointed at the poor customer service we experienced. When I go to a restaurant, I want to feel like they want my business."}
{"text":"Very loud place I'm assuming because of how many people are seated around you. Rather large restaurant which I think gives some echo. Menu is basic italian dishes. Nothing crazy and prices are fair.   Staff was nice and on the ball."}
{"text":"I love the lobster ravioli and there bread though not authentic has a herbal and unique taste epically with the oil they make. I enjoyed my experience very much also ran into an old waitress of mine."}
{"text":"Had a Caesar's shrimp salad for lunch at $7.95, one of the lunch specials.  Lettuce was off color and very light on the dressing.  The shrimp was coated in some kind of breading.  Very disappointing dish.  The bread brought to the table was warm and very good.  Large cups for coffee avoided having to have frequent refills.  Service was good. I expected more from the looks of the interior which was very attractive."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant in the past.  We had enjoyed the food and ambiance in the past, as an enjoyable outing for the family.  However, we have been finding a distinct drop in quality over our recent visits with our visit today as the worst.  In particular, we experienced the following during our dinner at Bravo (at the Homestead in Pittsburgh) tonight: Service was very slow overall despite the place not being especially busy with no wait for seating; complimentary bread took 20 minutes to arrive, and then the food arrived 60 seconds later;  the waiter forgot to bring side dishes; we requested extra marinara sauce for the eggplant parmigiana, they brought about a thimbfull's worth;   They charged $3 for about three medium sliced, sautéed mushrooms; coffee was served lukewarm and had to be replaced.  So, all-in-all, it was a disappointing dinner for the family.   Time to find a new restaurant for family outings...."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and got a fantastic server - Edward, he was very funny and charming and really made our experience special. All of our food was delicious, especially the brunch items we ordered. The flatbread was perfect and crispy."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  The waiter brought my meal to the table but didn't bring my friends meal at the same time.  By the time her meal arrived, mine was cold.  We said something to him about it and his response was, \"It's not my fault.\"  Really?!  What waiter responds with that?  The manager came to our table and we told her about it and she didn't seem to care.  Definitely won't be dining there again.  So unprofessional."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Bravo! From the first time I ate there. I love seafood, and I've been pretty spoiled by having the best seafood, most of my life. Growing up my grandfather was a seafood buyer for a chain grocery store, and my dad is an extremely talented fisherman. It's safe to say I've had some phenomenal dinners in my life. When I was a teenager, my family and I dined at Wholly's Restaraunt in the strip, and my whole family raved about their lobster bisque. Since then I've only had really good lobster bisque a handful of times. Wholly's. Awful Arthur's in Nagshead, NC. Bravo. Bravo's lobster bisque is very creamy, so if your looking for a bisque with chunks of lobster meat, I would not recommend it, I'd probably send you to Wholly's.  I prefer Creamier bisque so this is definitely a fave. I also love Caesar salads, and while I think Red Lobster's Caesar dressing is the best, Bravo!s is pretty yummy. It's very creamy and a little ,more fishy than most. (After all anchovies are part of what give Caesar its flavor) but very good. The Caesar salad is pretty big but deliscious nonetheless. I also like their feta dip appetizer, but haven't seen it on the menu in a while, so I'm not sure if it is a special or not. Overall love this Restaraunt and keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food is nice but it doesn't really have the most vegetarian options but they can arrange that for you, the place looks nice, the staff is nice as well. This is a good place for Italian food but not really the best."}
{"text":"Cheers to Bravo! I had a five star experience here...wish I had spent more money sheesh lol! From the service to the food to the atmosphere. All excellent! Will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Bad, generic food. Everything is greasy, cheesy and heavy. Nice interior design though. Their food is like a caricature of authentic Italian food. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of chain restaurants but this doesn't even feel like one! Authentic, fresh, Italian food. The entire staff is very friendly and hospitable. I normally sit at their bar, and I don't even feel like I am at a restaurant bar, but a neighborhood place with friends. Everybody is so nice!   This location just underwent a remodel and looks so beautiful. Their private room has an elegant, upscale feel."}
{"text":"Blah!  This was my 2nd visit to Bravo, 1st time I got a grilled chicken salad & had to send it back b/c the chicken was pink.  This time we started w/ the sangria rosa, way to sweet & was more like a daiquiri.  I got the chicken caprese & the chicken was very thin & like rubber, I could barely cut it, the orzo had zero seasoning.  So disappointed & we will not be going back!  Only reason for 2 stars instead of one was because we had good service."}
{"text":"Poor service and so so food.  Choose another eatery.  Drinks were slow to arrive.  Meals arrived hot but overly salty. 2 of 3 meals were awful however mine was very good - not a great ratio."}
{"text":"Dinner here is a winner in my book. It's easy on the wallet, kid friendly (which I imagine is a good thing), group friendly (there is even a private room for large groups), the bar is great, the food is terrific. Heck, I would drive all the way here just for the cheesecake. It's that good.  This is what I had last time I was here. I enjoyed every bit of it:  Insalata Dela Casa Chopped greens, cucumber, tomato, bacon, crispy pasta and creamy Parmesan dressing  Griled Chicken and Shrimp Scampi Pasta Sautéed shrimp, grilled asparagus, grape tomatoes and roasted garlic pesto tossed with angel hair pasta in our white wine lemon butter sauce and topped with grilled chicken   Minus the shrimp because I'm allergic = (   BRAVO'S Famous Chesecake Rich and creamy cheesecake topped with caramelized sugar and crème anglaise     Holy crap I would come here just for the cheesecake. Yep, it's so good I said it twice. Seriously man, this cheesecake is in a whole new dimension. Woah.  It's the bomb. (Do people even say that any more?)"}
{"text":"Bravo is simply hit or miss. That's the best way I can describe it. One visit, we will have a great experience, and then the next visit, it is not a good experience.   The service is usually pretty good (from the wait staff, anyway). This location recently under went new management, and it is not as good as it used to be. The managers are not as professional as the previous ones, and the entire restaurant overall has a different vibe to it. The restaurant, while still fairly new,  is showing a sign of its age. The restaurant design, however, is still gorgeous.   They have a great patio (including a bocce ball court) to sit out on during the summer time!    The parking lot is free and well-lit, though they do offer valet parking, as well.   Overall, while Bravo has its faults, it is an okay choice for dinner. If you happen to be in the area with a taste for italian food, give Bravo a try."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious!  Who knows how to cook a steak!  BRAVO!  everything was excellent from hostess, to bartender, to waiter to meals and dessert.  Excellence!"}
{"text":"I have no words. They're service is horrible. They almost made me sick by giving me regular pasta when I order gluten free... I've given them too many opportunities to redeem themselves. I'm throwing in the towel... Audra is amazing though... she actually cares ...   Update: Bravos so graciously had the manager (Ryan) call me and apologize for there mistakes. He went the extra mile and sent a gift card to make it up to me..... I went today to give them a second chance and what do you know.... they messed up my order AGAIN... they seemed unapologetic and Ryan himself swiped my gift card and told me I still owed 19.00... safe to say I'm all done! ... Ps Ryan don't call me or send me anything ..."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with there \"pasta bravo\" there signature dish . I also was equally disappointed with the lasagna . the red sauce is way to sweet .. I'm not going to go there again ...olive garden is a way better option to give you a idea ..not to mention most others"}
{"text":"Phenomenal staff! As soon as I walk in you are greeted by super friendly host. My server was fantastic, very attentive even when it was pretty busy. I order a pasta woozie and it was cooked perfectly! I will be returning very shortly!!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3 stars but because of the great service, I bumped it up to 4 stars.  Our waitress was fantastic! We went here to celebrate my daughters 18th birthday and really wanted to sit out on the patio but it was too cool outside.  I've been here once before and just couldn't remember the \"issue\" I had with it until we returned.  One of my main grievances is the limited menu. It just seems to be missing stuff and it was really hard for us to find something we wanted to eat.  The birthday girl was stumped and wanted to leave because she wanted shrimp Alfredo but our wonderful waitress said they could absolutely do it for us.  So here's what we ordered: Shrimp Napoli- most of us enjoyed it, not amazing but pretty good Shrimp Alfredo-The birthday girl loved it! Calamari(2 orders)- The first order was fantastic, it was hot and was both tentacles and rings(we love the tentacles). The 2nd order was mediocre. It was lukewarm and almost entirely tiny crunchy rings. It was like night and day.  The first order came out as an appetizer(hubby ordered) and the second order was mine that came out as part of my meal.  My guess is maybe they held it under the warmer until all the meals were ready. Pasta Woozie- (grilled chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach), My 16 year old wasn't thrilled with it, it just seemed to be missing some oomph, I tried it as well and it was just okay. The chicken almost tasted like fish in my opinion. Chicken, bacon flatbread-very yummy and everyone loved it. Kids Meal Pizza with Lemonade-The first pizza came out and my son picked off this black thing on the pizza and put it on the table.  My daughter looked at it and noticed it was one of those big mosquitoes! We called the waitress over and told her and she asked us if we'd like another one. She took the mosquito one back and brought out a fresh one. Kids Chicken Alfredo with Campanelle- Yummy. We had to add a little salt and pepper but my 6 year old loved it and the portion size was great! Kids Caesar Salad- Again, great portion size and it was good, I kept stealing bites but she didn't mind. Mediterranean Veg Salad (grilled zucchini, asparagus, roasted peppers, tomatoes, orzo, farro, mixed greens, sweet garlic vinaigrette, pine nuts, Feta, balsamic drizzle)- Pretty good. Add some raw onions and maybe grilled pita on the side and this would be perfect. At the end they were so sweet and brought out a molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle along with a bunch of spoons for us to sing to and celebrate the birthday girl. Usually a restaurant gives you a pretty sad looking birthday treat but they didn't. They also gave her a really nice handwritten card(great touch) and a gift card for a free dessert.  The restaurant was clean, well lit and not noisy. Will I return? Most likely I will return because they have great kids meal offerings, probably the better of any I've seen anywhere else and the apps we had were good and the bread is sooooo yummy.  The olive oil dipping sauce is divine and my very picky 9 year old son couldn't get enough of it. I can say that we are very guilty of having one too many baskets of these.  Sorry. Not sorry.  I just wish they would kick their menu up a notch (currently two pages) and get a tad more oomph in the kitchen. With so many choices out there it wouldn't be my first but the great location and the nice atmosphere certainly helps this place. That is all!"}
{"text":"Service is a lil slow,  but it's well worth the wait.  This place absolutely sticks the landing when it comes to authentic, flavorful, Italian food. The staff is always friendly and the food is 5 star every single time.  Well, maybe 4 sometimes ;-)  They NEVER lower the standard!  Thanks for being great when we needed you to be good."}
{"text":"Better than average food delicious!!!went on a sat night large party of 12 we were graciously accomadated with a beautiful table had the chicken bacon flatbread appetizers were hot and delicious great wine selections ordered 3 different bottles I had the chicken scallopinie the lobster ravioli and steak I heard great!!   Must must try cannoli desert our server Lauren was quick and efficient a real professional great job !!we will all return looking forward to it"}
{"text":"Cant comment on the service as we ordered take out, but the food was pretty good. Given the amount of tired old chains around in this area, this was a stand-out. Looked pretty nice inside, with its own bar with some folk eating there too (apparently by choice, there were enough spare tables)."}
{"text":"5 stars! They will not post it though so i will tell you here about my experience. I took my husband here for his birthday last night.  He had never been and I only had the pleasure one other time.  There was a huge party in one of the private rooms and we were behind them with getting our entrees.  We probably only had to wait ten extra minutes because of this,  but still a manager came over and informed us they were experiencing longer ticket times and it should be just a few extra minutes. When we received our food the steaks were spot on temperature wise and tasted terrific. A different manager came by and took my plate away and asked me how it was. .. I told him I was very impressed by the kitchen to be able to get out a huge ticket from the other party and to turn right back around and get ours out perfect. Big props to the entire staff for making his birthday dinner a great one!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions.  Share a dish and save some money.  It is pricey but worth it. Had pasta, salad, dessert and a bottle of wine.  All for around $100, for two."}
{"text":"We visited for our first time tonight. I was very happy withe the service; we were greeted and sat almost immediately, had our drinks and appetizers within a few minutes,  and didn't have extra plates or empty drinks all night. I spilled my martini and it was replaced promptly at no charge. The entrees were tasty and large, and the menu looked more like a Carrabas than an Olive Garden (that's a compliment! ).  It's exactly what I would like for the price, and the service really was very good (thanks Michele!)"}
{"text":"My family and I have always had a positive experience at Bravo. Today we visited, had a great meal, great time, and our server Andy was lovely and superb! He was the absolute best server we've ever had. Professional with a great attitude who would join in on our obnoxious Italian conversation and have us laughing. We couldn't stop talking about him during our meal and after. He was great in every aspect and went above and beyond to make our dining experience amazing. Thank you Andy for being accommodating, making us laugh, and being a fantastic server! We will be back! You made our day so much brighter! Thank you again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Italian Food in town!! Christina the manager always makes me feel so special and Kt is the reason I've been a regular customer here for 12 years, she's become like family to me. Doug makes me special meals every week and Alex has made a great atmosphere at Bravo McKnight it's like dining with family!! He always makes a point of stopping by and making sure my experience is perfect!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Nice staff. They have a grill which I think makes the food taste great. This is not my favorite Italian restaurant, but it's much better than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to restaurant in Ross Township. The food is consistently good, as are my favorite things to order. The Della Casa salad is great as an entree with the wedding soup, or as a side salad to the Chicken Parmesan. Yesterday's meal seemed a little slow to reach the table when the manager came to apologize for the delay. She had seen my meal that was about to be delivered and didn't think the pasta looked up to their standard presentation. It took a few minutes longer, but I received a deliciously prepared and presented meal! Then she offered a free dessert to eat there or take home to make up for the delay! She went the extra distance, without my asking, and impressed us at the table. Thank you! Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Perhaps our mistake was coming on Mother's Day night, but somehow I don't think so.  We had a reservation; the restaurant was only about a quarter full; we were seated immediately.  Our appetizers came out pretty fast, but that's where the good stuff stopped.  It was nearly an hour before our entrees came out, and, after all that, one order was so badly cooked the person could not eat it (burned, lacking enough sauce, etc.).  The kids' meals were missing items that took forever and a day to show up.  The two adults who ordered pasta got portions that were the exact equivalent of the kids' pasta portions - i.e., too small.  Also, the pasta dishes were bland beyond belief.  Service was soooooooooooo slow - had to ask for bread, grated cheese, refills on drinks,  our checks, etc.  We sat down at 7:00 and left at almost 9:00 - and the majority of that time was spent WAITING on something.  I don't live in the area so it's unlikely I would be back anyway, but I can  assure you that, if I have anything to do with it, I will NEVER darken those doors again."}
{"text":"Really like this place for the atmosphere. Nice, calm, comfortable, cute place to go with ur spouse or a friend and be able to get in a good conversation. Just a little more upscale than average without the crazy price. Service is pretty good, kind of depends on the waiter/waitress you get. Food is decent/average. Filet mignon is delicious. Must try their dessert. They bring you a platter of all the deserts they have for you to choose which one you'd like. Definitely worth a try to go to!"}
{"text":"First, I did not know it was a chain restaurant. That is a positive thing. Second, the decor and the menu are one of the best in our area, and definitely the best Italian. I love Italian food, and have waited 17 years for a good Italian spot in the Ballantyne area that was good and affordable. I am pleased. Third, and most importantly, perhaps - we have had GREAT service all four times we have eaten there. Every wait person has been very attentive and has had good people skills. Beyond that, Amanda, one of the managers, has come to greet us every time - even before she knew us. We came once on our anniversary, before we were regulars, simply mentioned we were celebrating, and were presented with a free dessert. I consider myself fairly snobby when it comes to food and wine (it's almost impossible to get 5 starts from me), and I have been quite satisfied. Decor, ambience, food, and people. Everything is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Bravo many times and the service is always very attentive. Order is delivered to table accurately and within an appropriate timeframe. The quality is always consistent and it seems they take care in the kitchen when expediting the dish. I love the chopped salads and shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"First time there. Very good. Started with the meatballs an polenta. Meatballs had a grwat sausage taste to them. I had the cheese tortellini and sausage. Very flavorful. Wife had the Mediterranean salad and she loved it. The bread and oil dip they served to start the meal was really tasty.  All of it was very good and we would all go back."}
{"text":"It was just subpar.  The food was decent and the service wasn't anything spectacular.  Waiting 20 minutes on a reserved table is one thing...  But then when they're out of Sam Adams Seasonal...  And then there is lipstick on your wine glass when you aren't wearing any...  And your server is absent it just makes for a drab experience.  The porkchop and the flatbread appetizer were definitely highlights."}
{"text":"Bravo! Has always been one of my favorites .. still to this date!! I have visited on dates, with family or friends and always a pleasurable experience.   I love the atmosphere and menu..  My usual is the penne mediterranean and a cesear salad.. together they are LOVE!   Their chopped salad is also out of this world and oh the pizza is outstanding.   The restrooms are always spotless.  I totally recommend Bravo!!"}
{"text":"First trip here . Loved the Caesar salad and pasta bravo! Dessert trio was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Normal chain Italian food here, nothing special. Even though I was craving \"fake Italian\" food, I was somewhat disappointed. I've come to bravo in the past but never paid much attention to the point of writing a review.   First off I was craving Olive Garden mostly for the soup salad and breadsticks but caved for Bravo because it was closer to my house. I ordered the pasta woozie which is what I usually get, chicken fettucine Alfredo with spinach. The waiter asked me what type of salad I wanted with my meal, this threw me off because I automatically assumed it came with a salad. Nope. You need to pay at least 5.99 extra for a salad. Strike 1. The meal does come with some pretty good bread and oil but when you're craving olive garden breadsticks there is nothing else that will fill that void.  Service was prompt and everyone was kind and attentive.   I hate comparing restaurants but I feel that bravo is just a watered down wanna be olive garden that falls short. I wish I would have driven the extra 2 miles for that unlimited salad and breadsticks with my fake italian meal. Oh well!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" restaurant!  The quality of the food is always great and we absolutely love the staff...shout out to K.T, Shannon and Josh!  The team always works hard to make you feel at home!  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome the steak is the best and the drinks are so good this is my 2nd favorite place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the Beachwood area.  Food and service is always fantastic.  The wine selection is great.  I love the lobster ravioli and if you want to indulge in an appetizer, the stuffed pepperoni bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal I just felt as though something was missing... More flavor ? More pasta :/ over all it was delicious with good service but I would have preferred more seasoning!"}
{"text":"Meh. We visited Bravo because I had a gift card. Service was good, but the food was mediocre. I recognized some of the menu choices as being the same or similar as Brio, another chain Italian restaurant - which must be in the same restaurant group as Bravo, but unfortunately the quality at Bravo didn't much what I've experienced at Brio.    No need to return."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Made reservations for 7pm knowing it would be busy. Hostesses do not know how to prioritize patrons. Not enough seating in lobby to accommodate. After 29 minutes past reservation time, finally got seated. Shouldn't have \"open table\". Food good though. Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"In the area and wanted to eat at another restaurant but it had a 45 minute wait.  Never so glad to have to turn to a second choice.  The staff was pleasant and attentive despite being very busy.  The Lobster Bisque was exceptional with large chunks of meat.  The Chicken Scaloppini was plentiful and cooked to perfection.  The Braised Pork Marsala was unique and a big hit.   Our dinners took longer than anticipated so we were given crispy ravioli while we waited.  A nice touch by the management and gained a regular customer when we are in the area."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the lovely staff I think my choice for Italian cuisine would be elsewhere. The food is good, just not very authentic. The host was sweet and very polite, we didn't have to wait. Our server,   Kierra is absolutely wonderful. For only spending a short amount of time with her you can tell she takes pride in her work and making others feel welcome. My husband and I will for sure be back to see her."}
{"text":"l like bravo for my aunt, it's close to her house, and she's ninety. My partner and l took her out for Easter. The place was packed and I'm sure it was a nightmare for all who worked. With that being said I blew a hundred dollars on the eggplant that was impossible to cut. My poor partner who has celiac, ordered the gluten free pasta. It floated to the table in watered down sauce, the pasta was chewy, and cheap garlic powder made it uneatable. The best part of the dinner? The cofee and desert. l really dispise paying a lot for crappy food. Bravo was good at one time, but the last few times l was there l felt as if it's a step away from the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Very blah. The cesear dressing tasted like mayonnaise. The food didn't haven't much flavor. I would highly recommend Olive Garden over Bravo."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, really well done decor, very nice and bright. The menu is good, not too big, but also not too small.   The food is not out of this world, omg delicious, but it certainly is not bad. Had the mozerella fried ravioli and the lobster ravioli...clearly coz I love the ravioli. The appetizer was nothing real great, just about what you would think, no distinct reason to order it the next time. The lobster ravioli was good, the sauce it came in was delicate. But again nothing to write home about.  There was certainly nothing bad about the place, but nothing super awesome either apart from the decor"}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st and only time on Easter. Food great but service was horrible. Took 37 minutes after ordering to get Soup and Salad, probably an additional 30 minutes after that to get entrees. Waitress was extremely inattentive. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta(rigatoni) with Alfredo sauce. Pasta was not  cooked well. It was still raw. The worst Alfredo sauce I ever had. Pinacoloda also bad. Never try this restaurant if you are looking for good Italian food"}
{"text":"We loved this place and will definitely return. Service was great, as were our salads, complimentary bread, and our drinks. Hubs had the Grilled Chicken Chopped salad and I had a Grilled Salmon salad. I am anxiously awaiting our return visit."}
{"text":"Ok, if a menu item says \"Petite Filet and Grilled Shrimp\" you would expect steak and shrimp, right? And if the menu description says \"Tuscan mashed potatoes\" you would expect a side of mashed up potatoes, right? Well, my order  had no shrimp and no mashed potatoes!! $21.49 for the dish and I'm missing two parts of it?! What kind of restaurant does that?? Never going back again.  Warning to others, if you order take out, make sure all your food is there!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, no complaints at all there. The service is also quite good at this location. The only real down side is that it is a little on the expensive side, even considering that Italian food is generally already on the slightly expensive side. Olive Garden will always be cheaper (and you'll get much more food), but if you're willing to spend, I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Since this was an Italian \"Chain\" Restaurant, I wasn't expecting much but the food was actually pretty good.  This coming from someone who actually doesn't mind Olive Garden once in a while though.  Think Olive Garden but slightly more upscale.      I probably wouldn't be back because when I am on vacation, I usually like to stick to places that I wouldn't be able to try anywhere else.  Try to get to places which are part of a city's culture.  So Chains would probably be out of the picture but I would recommend it to locals if you've never been there....."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Very nice staff. Did go when it was prime dinner time and although it was not super busy apparently everyone ordered at the same time so the kitchen got backed up. The manager did come over and apologize unsolicited which was nice. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Didn't think they would be kid friendly but that thought changed when they brought my granddaughters pizza dough to play with. They loved it. The thought they were at Nana's Cucina."}
{"text":"Better than expected. It's been a while since I've been to a Bravo, but I remember it being very noisy with average food.  The place was quieter than in the past, probably because we visited in between lunch and dinner so the crowd was thin which cut down both on chatter and kitchen noise. My salmon was well-cooked but the portion was a bit smaller than expected. Probably for the best, from a caloric standpoint. Good service from our server Andy. Overall this was a solid experience for a chain."}
{"text":"My Second, and Last Time!   Really disappointing!!!  Appetizer.. Zucchini Fritte- Edible, but terrible. The outside was thick and cake-y. The sauces were not good.   Meals.. Fettuccini Alfredo with Spinach- one of the worst sauces I've ever had. The spinach was wilty.  Linguini carbonara - not good, flavorless  Mashed Potatoes- (side) delicious, really yummy"}
{"text":"Really good food exceptional service. I couldn't decide between the lobster ravioli and the crab cakes. I ordered the LRavioli. Then the chef came out and said \"I heard you were in a dilemma\" he knelt down at the table and Sid I would choose the crab cakes. So I switched my ordered and he brought them to my table himself. Awesome service. And the crab cakes were delicious. The wedding soup was flavorful and the dipping oil for the bread tasted like roasted peppers! Great experience. Go!"}
{"text":"The worst. Food came out cold three times. On a positive note the manager comp'd the meal.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So , this is supposed to be an Italian restaurant but none of the staff are from Italy or even have Italian in them. But, the overall food Is not bad. Again if you are looking for real Italian, this is not for you. The reason why I gave this 3 stars is because our waitress was new and totally messed up all our orders and it took nearly an hour for appetizers then another hour for dinner and thirty more minutes for dessert that was free on them.  I will give this another chance. I will admit the best thing on the menu is the veal cutlet"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bravo! in the Ballantyne area.  The restaurant looks upscale, both inside and out, but fortunately, they're casual with affordable prices.    I made reservations on OpenTable, and we were promptly seated upon arrival and greeted by our server.  We ordered a bottle of wine and our entrees soon afterwards.  That was pretty much the last time we saw our server.  Our food was delivered by someone else and our plates were cleared by another.  Another server then came by to show us the dessert options, take our dessert order and deliver the dessert, and then bring us our check.  Meanwhile, our main server was spotted chatting with another table for quite some time.  It was quite odd, and we hoped she wasn't going to get the full gratuity that was left on the check with her name attached to it, because she certainly didn't earn it.    The complimentary bread with olive oil dip and all of our pasta entrees were delicious, as was the peanut butter brownie \"petite dessert\" that the three of us shared."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times.  Food is typical chain food.  This review is based on last night,  I went in to get a gift card.  It was late.  Not full.  Not busy.  The floor by the server spot was SO sticky.  Then I went to the bar for her to ring it up, and it was even stickier!  I said gosh let me peel my shoes off the floor.  She said, Oh I know it's bad in here tonight.  Excuse me.  Fix it.  Lots of servers standing around.  Pick up a MOP!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night - Service and food ok, however went with a party and our order took forever to come, and one girl literally had cold shrimp and a leather steak.   Here on business, not enticed to try again."}
{"text":"My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...  This place?   Go if...  You want a fancier Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This restaurant need a much better organization.  We went there for a friends birthday but the experience with the staff make the night unpleasant.  they really need a management organization. the food was ok but for the prices they make sure that the customer feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Bravo! before but tried it for the first time the other night.  We went with a large group and had a reservation.  They were pretty packed.  Service was pretty good and attentive throughout so no issues there.  Make no mistake - this is chain Italian but I thought it was pretty good.  Definitely better than the Olive Garden and Buca di Beppo and probably on par with a Maggiano's.    They do have a full bar but no beer on tap.  Not cool.  They had a couple of IPAs which is a plus but everything else was very generic domestic.  Our table started out with a number of apps and they were all decent.  Calamari was solid and I also liked this pepperoni cheese dip.  The complimentary bread was actually very good.    For my meal, I did something strange.  I started with a Caesar salad and then went with their chicken chopped salad.  What can I say?  I like salads and was trying to keep it somewhat healthy.  The Caesar was pretty standard but definitely nothing to write home about.  I very much enjoyed the Chicken Chopped salad.  It was fresh and came with a ton of grilled chicken.  It was a cool place for a group to go.  I'd have no issue going back again."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent.  Service was great and food was thoughtfully prepared.  I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Bella Vista!!!  Great spot and the comp valet parking is a plus.  Food is authentic Italian.  They did not have Limoncello.  Then again not many Charlotte spots make this exquisite after-dinner digestive.  The pasta and gravy remind me of my momma's cooking in NY."}
{"text":"Wow! The place looks gorgeous from outside and it is quite pretty from the inside as well. Crowded on Father's Day - a 30 min wait to get a table . They have a lot of seating but the occasion called for a full house! Just amazing to see people enjoying with the parents!  The drinks - the good old 'old fashioned' was nice and so was the lobster bisque soup . It just paired up really well with the hot bread . Like a lot of yelpers have mentioned - the bread with the dipping oil is good !  The food was a disappointment- just assumed that the Bravo Pasta( with mushrooms and chicken) would hit it out of the park- but it was only average but thank god for atleast average since the chicken Parmesan just did not make the cut :( little flavor to it - and I could get the same at any cheap Italian joint . Desert- the seasonal which was a berry cake with vanilla ice cream. Well presented but just an average desert One more thing - a fellow yelper mentioned to be careful with the cutlery - so we made sure that we checked everything before using it and ALAS - a dirty spoon came with the soup . I'll still go again but only for the ambience and the nice restaurant decor"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about going to Bravo because I hadn't had the best experience at Northlake and I generally HATE chain Italian places. But I came for one of their opening lunches where we got to try a lot of dishes and was blown away and pleasantly surprised! I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  The Crispy Shrimp Napoli appetizer totally blew me away. Never in a million years would I believe that I would crave a fried shrimp app and drive halfway across the city to eat it, but this absolutely did. It's somehow light and crispy but paired with this rich unidentifiable but totally delicious red pepper/tomato cheesy creamy sauce and arugula. My party called it Crack Shrimp. The beef carpaccio also was absolutely delicious and admittedly even better than my favorite non-chain Italian place. Antipasto is also nice.  For mains, my pick is the Shrimp Fra Diavolo for the top menu item. It's not ultra spicy like some Fra Diavolo, so don't let it scare you off. It's also a bit creamier like a Vodka sauce, but not too creamy. It was absolutely tender and delicious. I also really enjoyed the marsala mushroom sauce over  the marsala chicken and mashed potatoes.  We got to sample the chicken off the gluten free menu and didn't care for it - it didn't have enough sauce to it and was too bland and also didn't care for the sweet potatoes. But I appreciated that they had GF options and might opt for something else from the GF or light menu. I can't speak to the desserts because I haven't tried them. I look forward to trying their weekend brunch menu because there are such limited options around town for brunch, and I love a fritatta!  My favorite part (Attention parents!!) is that I saw a family with kids get some raw pizza dough to \"make their own pizza\" and they fire it up in the brick oven which is a super cute way to keep kids occupied before food comes. I thought it was a nice touch, and smart in such a family-oriented neighborhood like South Charlotte.  The service has been super friendly. Bottom line- It's a good value and love the outdoor area, especially where you can people watch and listen to weekend entertainment!   Sidenote: For people who commented that Bravo doesn't have authentic Italian, I would challenge you to find a restaurant here that does. No, not Villa Antonio, not Vivace, certainly not godawful Maggiano's or Carabbas. I just returned from Italy and was struck by the simplicity of the best dishes we ate there like Cacio y Pepe which is really simple pasta, olive oil, salt pepper and a little cheese which is ridiculously good, but you just won't find something that simple here. So let's just consider them all Italian-American, OK? So the bottom line is for a chain, Italian-American, Bravo's my fave."}
{"text":"I knew when we walked in and everyone was smiling it was going to be a good night!  We got there around 8:30 and were seated immediately, ordered a couple of waters and some wine and then got down to business...  For starters we ordered the Crispy Shrimp Napoli...I tried to get a picture but we practically devoured them! The main reason was the super Napoli sauce...it was a mix of sweet and spicy and paired very nice with the crispy shrimp...just so you can get an idea how good that sauce was we requested another basket of bread to make sure we could send a clean plate back to the kitchen, lol  For my meal I had the Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka...where do I begin....the  ravioli was cooked perfectly and each was filled with a very yummy lobster and cheese mix and again that sauce! The tomato cream sauce had cherry tomatoes and shrimp...how can you go wrong with a combination like that?!?!? Can you say amazing!!!  My friend has the Chicken Marsala, it came with green beans and mashed potatoes...again very delicious my only complaint was the mashed potatoes for me they were just to plain very underwhelming...but still this plate gets a thumbs up from me!  Tiramisu for dessert and another clean plate back to the kitchen and Bravo's is on my list of favorite places...will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many, many times on business and family outings.  The food has always been pretty good as was our meal last night.  The only reasons I don't rate our experience higher are 2 recurring issues we've encountered on more than one occasion and again last night -  Dirty dishes & silverware.  Not spotty, still have food on them.  Major buzzkill when we have to examine our plates, forks, etc.  Not the first time this has happened.  Unacceptable in a restaurant of this reputation and cost.  Also they have an real ongoing issue with wait staff that disappear for 20 minute periods leaving us with long periods of empty drinks, etc.  Wait staff always appear very rushed and not able to take care of our table.  We don't sit for 3hrs and drink wine with friends, I just want to feed my family and go home.  Really affects the enjoyment of a nice family dinner.  Busy Saturday but not overly crowded.  My guess is they are overtasking wait staff with kitchen duties.  I always give the wait staff the benefit of the doubt.  Love Bravo but they have to address the overall dinner experience at this price point."}
{"text":"Came in for a happy hour drink. The bartender was very slow and didn't realize my empty wine glass, after offering my friend another glass 10 minutes earlier. He never checked back with me and I had to flag down another waitress to refill my wine. Nothing great to report here, which is why I rarely go to chains!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had planned to go for dinner but then discovered their great happy hour specials. $5 apps and drinks! So we sat at the bar and each ordered a drink and a few apps. The stuffed peppers were delicious and had a good bite to them. The burger was very juicy and came cut in half perfect to share. We'll definitely come back for happy hour again for a cheap date night."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month as we travel through Pittsburgh and although we really can't comment on the service because we always get take-out, I feel that it's probably fairly consistent.  I know the food certainly is!  No matter what we get, we seem to be very pleased.  It also helps that we use their meal card and after a certain number of initials on the card the meal is on them.  So it's very worth the trip there. (Just remember to bring the card with you-I always forget)  There aren't many good Italian places outside of downtown, (and after experiencing NY's Little Italy even less) but this one comes pretty close!  If you live in town don't waste your time and money with the other places and if you're coming from out of town, go right there you'll save yourself a big hassle looking for a quality place."}
{"text":"We went around 12 on a Sunday and had the brunch menu. The food was really great (chicken/spinach flatbread, the pepperoni pizza and the Sicilian omelette) and were all prepared well and exactly how we had ordered. The pizza was spot on and the omelette was amazing. The egg was cooked perfectly and the mixture of Sicilian favorites inside were outstanding. The brunch potatoes had a good crunch to them and just the right amount of seasoning. I certainly wasn't hungry after all of that.   The issue we had was with the service. After it started out okay, our waitress disappeared and spent most of the time talking with the gaggle of servers behind the large plant in the middle of the room. There were maybe 10 servers all standing around talking and we weren't the only table that noticed. Hopefully the service is better next time."}
{"text":"very nice place for Italian food.. highly recommended. a little expensive but worth it..MUST try TIRAMISU....my best tiramisu so far..."}
{"text":"After an evening looking around the local Apple store we stopped in to have some dessert and it was great!  Although we were there at 7:30 on a Thursday night they seated us immediately and didn't mind that we just wanted dessert.   Our waiter was really friendly and the atmosphere was beautiful.  I almost felt under dressed in dressy casual attire but it was fine.  We ordered three different desserts so we could share and pass them around. It was the best choice because they were all really wonderful.  We shared the Molten Lava Cake, the Mascarpone Caramel Cheesecake and the Creme Brulee. I will say it was hard to pick between the Lava Cake and the Creme Brulee for which was my favorite. The Lava cake was so dark and rich with no after taste and they paired it with a vanilla gelato that was light and creamy so the two textures together just melted in your mouth.  The Creme Brulee was a perfect Creme Brulee. The top had the perfect \"shatter effect\" when you broke into it and the creamy custard had a great vanilla flavor. I was quite happy that I ordered it. The Cheesecake was my least favorite because it was a very heavy and dense slice.  I did not care for it being that heavy and I did not really taste the caramel in it.Over all it was a great ending to our day and we want to come back and have a full dinner meal here for sure."}
{"text":"Bad service, the staff is not friendly at all. The food is average and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place knowing it was a chain. Wait staff was not good, only came by to take our order, deliver our food and try to sell us desert. This guy was one of the \"trainers\" and said everything right but acted like he didn't care. Food was mediocre at best. For the price of this place it is not worth the money. Try someplace else."}
{"text":"If you want a great food and excellent service, THIS IS THE ONE!!!!. This is my favorite place in Pittsburgh so far.   Today(8/18/2016), I arrived there during my lunch break from work. So, I was seated outside and the waitress was busy and she was a few minutes late. THEN, the manager came and sincerely apologized to me, which I was not actually bothered by it at all. But honestly, this place cares a lot more about customer service!!! Which I was very pleased by his kindness. So, he insisted that my lunch is free yaay !!  Thank you so much for the great service and the delicious meal. I appreciate it. I'll definitely recommended this restaurant to everyone ifIf you are in Pittsburgh and if you want to be treated right. Good job BRAVO"}
{"text":"The food is very good, we had pizza and chopped salad, so good. We ate at the bar and the service was so so. Too many employees at sitting at the end of the bar, witch ment the bartender's we're busy with them and not the guest."}
{"text":"Went with coworkers, and we all had a good meal. All road warriors with 60+ nights out per year. Good service, tasty entrees, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like Bravo. I mean I realize it is a chain but I like chains. If the food is good and the service isn't too horrible and I don't feel like I am being devoured by capitalist America it ends up being not so bad.  I most frequently order the Pasta Woozie. I like saying the word Woozie. Sometimes we joke about it and say in a sing-song childish voice \"Do you want the Woozie?\" which a waitress said to me once. It tastes good."}
{"text":"Bravo is just...eh. As a chain restaurant, I think it lacks that personality...that allurement...that \"oomph\" factor! Yes, the decorations are nice and the waiters very attentive, but it almost feels unnatural...unauthentic. It is on the fancier end, but prices aren't too bad. Good place for birthdays and celebrations.   I wasn't too impressed by the food. The plates were huge, but portions not so huge. The dishes had a nice set up, but the taste was average. I got their signature pasta bravo with chicken. It came with this creamy tomato sauce and pasta. They forgot to give me chicken though, and I didn't even realize that until the waiter pointed it out. So I ended up eating the additional chicken by itself because almost done with my pasta. The sauce was good, but nothing memorable. The pasta a bit too tough and undercooked for my taste. The chicken...just grilled, nothing much to say about that.   Overall, I thought Bravo was just okay. Fancy on the exterior, but lacking substance."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pasta Woozie better known as Chicken Alfredo. It was dry, not enough chicken and the noodles were hard. The server was not attentive and I swear he didn't speak English, because he would mumble something and smiled.  The bread was hard and tasteless. This place gets a  especially for the location."}
{"text":"It's bravo! Or \"bravo's\" as my dad calls it. What's bad to say about it besides that it's a chain and has the chain restaurant feel to it. -1 one star for that.   Good food. Good service. Clean. Good atmosphere.  Had lunch here today and had the chicken, spinach and bacon flatbread. Yum! Moist chicken and well baked.  Tasted as if they put their spinach dip on flatbread.  Outstandingly good stuff.  Had the fresh bread and sun dried tomato oil.  I could eat just that and I would be satisfied most of the time.  It was dad's birthday so right before the check came, they comped my dad a birthday sundae!  good on them!"}
{"text":"Being that I'm from the south, I don't get to experience these chain restaurants so they feel new and unchain like!  The crispy shrimp Napoli was great. I had them put the sauce on the side and added the diablo and creamy horseradish sauce to use in addition! Great idea so the shrimp can stay extra crispy. I also had the lobster bisque which wasn't bad but extra cheesy. Not normal for a bisque. Drank a white peach sangria, it was okay but the peach really took over. Overall nice place and great service."}
{"text":"We sat outside at the Bravo at Blakeney Village and it was a nice night and a good atmosphere and great service. I had the Grilled Chicken with sundried tomato goat cheese and it was delicious. My girlfriend had the spicy shrimp in pasta. We both love spicy food but this was a little too spicy. Other than that the meal was what you would expect from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Tammy!!  Thank you for your sincere service!  I'm not a big fan of Italian food, but we came to celebrate. I ordered the lamb chops and they were divine!! And if people don't know me, I literally eat the bones clean. The seasoning on it was great. I wasn't a big fan of the sides that it came with. It was some potatoes with mushroom side dish which I could not consume at all.   Got the trio dessert ! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Disorganized, stopped to eat, many tables open. Given a 10 min wait time. Probably will not come back. If they change there practices i may come back."}
{"text":"Went out this evening with my BFF for some shopping and a meal. We had planned on The Cheesecake Factory, but when we called for a wait time, we were told 80 minutes with no call ahead seating. We decided to call Bravo! Since both of us had only been there once years before. We were told a wait time of 30 minutes and took my phone number to put us in the \"wait line\".   We got there about 15 minutes after making our reservation and the place was PACKED! Big groups were coming in at 6:30 and were being told 1 hour wait times. I was so grateful that I called ahead!    When we were seated (within the 30 minutes), our waiter Austin came by for our drink order almost IMMEDIATELY! He was fun and personable. He bent over bacward to be quick and attentive even though it was a packed house.    I got the Caprese salad, wich was DIVINE! The balsamic vinaigrette here is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I also ordered the Pasta Diavlo with chicken that I could barely eat after indulging in the salad and Delicious bread and seasoned oil! My friend had the Pasta Woozie (a take on Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo). She said the pasta was cooked perfectly and the alfredo sauce had a perfect blend of cream, cheese, and garlic! Her only complaint was she only found 2 pieces of chicken.    All in all it was a FANTASTIC visit and a wonderful night. We will definitely be back, and next time eat at the bar to see Austin who was the best waiter I have had in a LONG TIME!"}
{"text":"I'm giving a two star b/c the food was awesome but service was terrible.  We were sat and it took almost 10 minutes for anyone to come up to us (which I've waited tables before so they tell you if it's been 10 minutes it feels like 20 minutes to the guest) our waitress finally took our drink orders and that took forever to get to us.  We finally ordered and after we got our soup she came back and said she was so sorry but she lost her paper with our order.  I'm thinking are you kidding me so you haven't even put in our order? Wow the manager apologized finally gave us free desert which nice gesture but by then you don't want desert your full.  We waited"}
{"text":"Birthday celebration for my sister with 7 family members. The food was \"average\" at best, service was a bit less than average and the table we were placed at was unstable and we all had to be very careful while cutting food or resting our arms on the table. We almost upset the table several times with water spilling everywhere. When we were leaving, we mentioned to the server that there was a major problem with the table and he said, Yes, it's been like that for a long time. Everyone has problems. Well my feeling is....fix the problem so that people can have an enjoyable dining experience at your restaurant. Our food was decent but it was not terrific."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Good selection of italian food. My daughter loves this place, its great for picky kids as well. Staff are wonderful and accommodating. Food is excellent. A little bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"At 7PM on a Tue this resturant was not even half full.  After 2 attempts to have Salmon cooked properly I gave up.  The portion sizes have been reduced drastically adding to the disappointment from a prior above average chain. The ladies rest room was a mess , I could go on but you get the idea Just go to, Delallos for a fab dinner"}
{"text":"Started with the pepperoni flatbread, cold and not very good.  Server could not keep up with refills and was not very attentive to our table.  Plates started to pile up between the bread plates, salad blows and appetizers.  We asked twice to get the table cleaned off before our entrees arrived.  My Pasta Bravo was the house special and was just okay given it was the house special.  Kids salmon was over cooked and the wife's salad was marginally okay.  It will be awhile before we return given other options in the area."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain Italian restaurant . I prefer the small family owned places but this place will do in a pinch . I was really suprised with the service . Top Notch. Waiter and manager were very attentive .  This location is in the Galleria  mall . Small outdoor seating area which is next to drive way and parking lot . Not very pleasant but no problems ."}
{"text":"Wedding soup was like how Grandmom  used to make it which is a very good thing. However, lasagna was much too heavy on cheese and noodles where boiled too long, calamari was very brittle with little flavor.  Service was mediocre at very best as my glass was empty majority of eve.  Worse than Macaroni grill."}
{"text":"Rather good & fresh Italian food for a place that is a chain and is located in a strip mall-ish area. The inside is large with many tables so you shouldn't ever have to wait too long, and there are many servers and chefs so your food should come out pretty quickly. Also, the corkage fee is only $5 so you can easily bring a bottle to enjoy with your meal.  I would definitely recommend including one of their side salads with your entree. I had the chopped salad which was delicious (all fresh ingredients, a lot of toppings) and my boyfriend had the house salad which he really enjoyed. I ordered the napoli pizza, which was pretty good: the crust is thick & bready, a lot of cheese, but the sauce was low on flavor & the \"fresh basil\" listed as an ingredient actually was 1 giant basil leaf baked into the middle of the pizza (no longer fresh and not really edible), though all in all it was a good pizza.  My boyfriend had the shrimp & lobster ravioli with sherry tomato sauce and he really enjoyed it. We were both too full for dessert, but there were some yummy looking choices.   The servers didn't seem particularly happy but it was New Years Eve so they probably wanted everyone to eat & leave quickly so they could too. Our waitress kept giving us & the bottle of champagne we brought funny glances but I think it was because she was trying to figure out how old we were and whether to ask...after we showed our IDs, she was quite nice. All in all, it was a satisfying meal and I definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Brio and Bravo are in the same group of restaurants, each sporting very similar color motifs and materials -- as well as delightful Italian pop playing in the background.    I went this past weekend with my parents.  We'd originally thought about going to Brio -- my mother really likes their ravioli.  Perhaps it was a bad day, but, while the service was excellent -- the actual food was a bit disappointing.  My father had steak flatbread, we shared calamari, my mother had a grilled chicken, and I had chianti braised beef ravioli.  We were rather disappointed.  The calamari doesn't have the hints of jalepeno that mark Brio's version - breading was thick, and a bit overwhelming to the poor squid.    The pricing is lower than Brio's... and the menu selection is biased towards a slightly simpler fare (IMO).    Given that the two are relatively close geographically, I think this was an attempt at market segmentation.  Bravo wasn't bad - it was fair.    But I suspect I won't be going back given the plethora of other little spots scattered about the city."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I used to take my family here from time to time for a decent Italian chain meal but the quality of service an good has declined.   The waiter was polite but not present for long periods of time. The lobster ravioli were bland and the presentation was sloppy. Looked like they just plopped it on the plate. The chicken and portobello mushroom was not bad but under seasoned and didn't have enough sauce. The one thing that made me still give them a three was the pizza for the kids. It was a really nice pizza and looked like a homemade Italian pizza. Otherwise I would have given them a 3 star.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch or dinner on any day of the week.  Had a chance to go here for lunch today and had a wonderful experience. __________________________________________________________ Highlights: *CLEAN - the restaurant looked immaculate.  Even though we were one of the day's first patrons, the place was clean, and I'll take that whenever I can get it * GREAT SERVICE - Waitress was friendly and polite.  Even though our waitress was training another waitress, it didn't interfere with the service or our overall dining experience. *PERFECT TIMING - any great dining experience has great service and great PACE with that service; quick, but not rushed.  We were able to get in and out within 45min, which was just what my gf and I were looking for. *PRICE - For such a nice, upscale feeling place, the prices are very reasonable.  We were able to get in and out for UNDER $30, and that included a Mimosa.   PARKING -  COMPLIMENTARY VALET FOOD - Both of our dishes (see pics) were very tasty and filling.  Everything tasted freshly made, and was made to our mutual liking.  Low-lights: *Nothing comes to mind.  I am a fan of this place, and would jump at the chance to dine here again."}
{"text":"Sunday 5pm walked in. Bravo was half empty. Hostess said there was \"no good place for 6 people to sit\". Had us wait 50 minutes yet Bravo was HALF EMPTY!!  It stayed HALF EMPTY the entire night. Server was sloppy/disinterested/distracted. All in all it was an unusual dinner experience. Have had much better experiences at Bravo North Hills & Cranberry Bravo locations."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian chain hands down. The food is good, although not spectacular. Always have an enjoyable experience when we go."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience when dining here.  Nice atmosphere, great service, and delicious food. Paola was our server last night for our anniversary.  She was very friendly and helpful in making our dinner selections.  She recommended the new Salmon & Shrimp risotto and it was awesome.  Manager also came by to wish us a Happy Anniversary.  He gave us a complimentary creme brûlée and card signed by the staff.  We definitely felt special."}
{"text":"Meh. I wasn't the one paying for my full course meal, but if I was, not the place I would choose.   I ordered a pasta with shrimp and lots of garlic, and it was very greasy. I also shared a New York steak. I asked for medium rare, but it was cooked more like medium well.  Furthermore, I was unsatisfied with the service. I came with a group of 6 people. We clearly saw large, empty tables, but the hostess at the front said that we would have to wait for about 30-40 minutes. I pulled out my OpenTable app and saw a table for 6 in ten minutes. I made my reservation and we were seated ten minutes later at my reservation time.  I do not plan on returning.  --  taste / 3 aesthetics / 3 vibe / 3 service / 1 price for quality / 2 OVERALL / 2.4"}
{"text":"I  visited Bravo! for lunch and was satisfied with the experience, so I recommended it for team dinner with co-workers and management last night. It was a huge mistake. I've never seen Italian tomato cream soup made so heavy, filled with cheese and topped with croutons, but no basil. Speciality of the day was tilapia with crab, which was for sure not freshly prepared, overcooked and not fresh itself, served with slightly burned, dry potatoes. It actually caused half of the team to get sick! On dessert I got some berry pastry with ice-cream, that turned out to be microwaved muffin with defrosted strawberries.  It might be still my sick, European stomach speaking - but it was disastrous. Even beer didn't help."}
{"text":"Dissapointed :( We had an early dinner yesterday. There was no hostess to greet us, but we did notice (3) servers sitting @ the bar? Our waiter did not seem to enthusiastic at all to serve us. We had appetizers and ordered the fillet mignon dish which came w/ mashed potatoes, but we where told it was to early, so we had the potatoes ?  The steak was over cooked, dry and had hardly any seasoning. The veggies had to much oil and overly seasoned and salty. The potatoes!!! Well all I had on my plate was potatoes skins dry, very crispy and salty. (I only had the meat) ??? I wanted to really like this place, but will not be returning ;0("}
{"text":"Consistently good food. I really like the atmosphere.  Even the salads are good and quite creative.   The bread and infused oil served before your entree is wonderful.   Unfortunately the health rating could be a little higher. We confirmed this because we we served two bread on,yes that were dirty, and a glass of water had floaties."}
{"text":"We chose Bravo to celebrate my son's birthday, and I must say they are consistently great!  The seafood ravioli, chicken parm, and kids pizza were all very good.  It was a week night so no crowds, just in and out."}
{"text":"Wow absolutely disappointed with my experience today. Came here expecting high quality food as I've experienced in the past. Before the meal, I used the ladies room, which was stinky, unclean and lacking toilet paper. After telling the waitress, she rudely respond that it was the host's job to clean it, not hers. Looking forward to the appetizer, I overlooked this detail.   Until... The Ceasar salad was old, yellow soggy lettuce. The lobster bisque had maybe one piece of lobster, and it was luke warm. My \" 5 Oz Bravo steak\" was the size of a 50 cent piece. I literally looked around for the hidden camera guy to jump out and say, gotcha! I forgot to take a picture. That's how appalled I was. After politely asking the waitress about the 2 bite steak, she rudely responded that, \"I could get you a new one, but it'd be the same size.\" Talk about customer service! Not. The char on the outside was way to much. Inside however, was cooked to order, medium. The veggies were burned to an inedible crisp. My mother ordered the grilled chicken marsala, also burned to a crisp! Dry as an old shoe. The manager finally came over and agreed to take our meals off the bill. At least she knew when they screwed up. Although she made a comment that i should've spoken up sooner. Umm, I tried, but your rude waitress who clearly hates her job didn't care what I had to say.  I will definitely not be returning! If you read my other reviews, you know I always have positive ones. Unfortunately this was not the case today. So sad to see a good establishment go downhill."}
{"text":"Terrible. Overpriced. Pepperoni pizza was about high school cafeteria quality.  Salads have iceberg lettuce.  Walk across fountain to Brixx or Chop't"}
{"text":"Food was very good and prepared as I had asked. The service at the bar was another thing.  No utensils when appetizer was delivered no bread and never asked. More concerned on watching the TV  and if I ever needed anything else. May need to try the dining room next time IF I return"}
{"text":"Great ambiance - food was served very quickly & the waitress was very pleasant. A bit on the pricey side compared to some of the local fare (Armstrongs is a comparable establishment that is not chain related though). Brick oven food is tasty though here."}
{"text":"This place is great, always reasonably quick service even when it's busy. I went today after we left PF Chang's after being ignored for 15 mins.  Got great fast service at Bravo and I even got a free little birthday dessert for my birthday from the server. I highly recommend the grilled salmon salad. I get it most every time i go there and it's always great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and very attentive service. I had the lobster ravioli and loved it, the only thing they could have done better is adding more sauce to the dish"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Bravo, and I promise it was also my last. We visited this establishment as a large group for a company dinner outing. As a party of 10, in a fairly empty restaurant on a Monday night, we spent over 2 hours of our 2.5 hour meal waiting for items. A member of our party asked for a glass of water upon sitting down, and an hour later it was finally brought to the table when it was requested a second time. It took over 45 minutes to get bread, which was requested more than 4 times, and our meal, which took 30 minutes for them to even be ready to take our order, took another 45 minutes to come out. When we completed our dinner, and ordered desserts, two appetizers came out (which were ordered well before the meals and subsequently forgotten as a result of the slow service). At the completion of our meal, there was additional trouble with the bill causing multiple authorizations of a $300 bill on the credit card being used to pay. The manager was less than accommodating and the servers (even with two, the service was awful) only apologized after they certainly got into trouble after we complained to the rude manager. I hope that this restaurant has \"regulars\" to keep them afloat, because if this is how the service is provided to newcomers, during restaurant week no less, this place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Food was generic. Service was awful. All three of my kids' meals had clearing been sitting for awhile before they arrived - the bowl of pasta was hard and the pizza was not fresh out of the oven. I ordered the chicken caprese salad. I received two large chicken breasts, not exactly what I was expecting for a \"salad\" and each one had one slice of tomato and one nickel size slice of mozzarella on top. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is a better than average chain restaurant located in the Galleria mall on Route 19. I have only been disappointed here once, when the portion size of the salmon they gave me on the entree salad I ordered was miniscule, but they more than made up for it by delivering a whopping piece to the table toot sweet. I've not had a bad meal here since, and I've worked through quite a bit of the menu. They have a vegetarian lasagne on the seasonal menu right now that is one of the best I've ever had. Their entree salads are satisfying and filling, as well as delicious, so I don't feel deprived when I skip the pasta here, as I sometimes do. They'll make any pasta dish with whole wheat spaghetti, which is a nice touch. Great service, a varied and interesting menu, and delicious food."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and waited over an hour for our meal  The manager apologized but they should of not charged us at all We'll never   We were contacted by Alex the service manager and was very nice and corrected the problem and we wanted to repost and tell everyone Thanks again for caring"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6:30PM and the place was packed so I only had to wait till 6:35PM to be seated. My tables waitress took quite some time coming to our table and bringing our drinks. I understand she had Many tables so the process was slow, however, it felt too long to wait for drinks.   The lemonade was freshly squeezed and tasted marvolous ( highly recommend it)  I ordered the Calamari Fritti for $12.00 and I must say that this was over priced for what you get. I'm a big fan of calamari and some of the pieces were over cooked and way too chewy. They could of done something to make it look nicer.   I ordered the Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka for my main entrée. The food was nice and tender. The lobster melted in my mouth and all the flavors blended nicely.   Overall, Bravo was a nice place to sit down and enjoy a casual dinner. The staff was very friendly and very familiar of their product. I would recommend this place to a few friends and I might go back to get a different experience."}
{"text":"As far as chains go, Bravo is dependable. I can always count on getting a decent salad. This location offers reservations, which is helpful in avoiding long lines and 45 minute waits.  I enjoy the Romano crusted chicken salad as well as the balsamic chicken salad. The Parmesan dressing is delicious, and I have even tried to recreate it at home.  I am not a big fan of the entrées here as they are loaded with salt, but I do enjoy stopping in to grab a salad while shopping at the Waterfront or catching a movie.  There is always plenty of parking, which is key."}
{"text":"Not recommended.  Staff is not knowledgable and menu is overpriced for what it is. If you want true Italian food, go up  Ballantyne Commons Rd to Villa Antonio's in Ballantyne!  Far better, and about the same price!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain. Yes, it was busy. Yes, I would go back.  I was staying at a nearby hotel, and was happy to find this place within walking distance. The waitress was extremely attentive and very friendly, and I appreciated her suggestions and modifications to ensure that my food was vegetarian. She really made the meal.  The food was good quality, too. I enjoyed my salad, and tried it on the recommendation of my waitress... she knew her stuff. If I am in Pittsburgh again, I will look this place up and give it a whirl."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Nothing like Olive Garden!! Food was fresh...herbs awesome...and Christina our waitress was incredible!! She knew the menu and exactly what we were looking for!! She was prompt and super friendly!! Definitely coming back to try a new dish!! Btw had the lobster ravioli ammmmmazzzing!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have only been a few times but each time the food was awesome! Also they have bar bites which you can get certain appetizers for $2.95 between certain times. A very good deal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met a couple friends for dinner and they suggested Bravo. It is a chain (more of an east coast eatery) located at the North Lake Mall. They claim to be an affordable upscale dining experience...and I agree. Dishes will run $10-$25 and side salads around $5.    We were promptly greeted and seated. The hostess was very friendly and we found our server courteous as well. The dishes were of generous proportion and had good flavor. The night we went they were out of port and sherry (a wedding party the day before drank it all). However, the manager came to our table and was nice to suggest alternatives.   If I were to describe how this Italian restaurant fairs compared to others, I would say Olive Garden is on one end and Maggiano's on the other and this one in between the two. They can accommodate large parties as well (I saw them easily transform a couple tables to make for a large party).  They offer $5 Valet or you can park in the mall parking lot, but you may have to walk a short distance. I don't make it to this area often, but I am happy to know I can get a good meal here the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Bravo was a solid three stars for lunch.  We were seated right away, our service was prompt and food was good. Coming from an Italian family where \"you don't eat red sauce out\", I can't vouch for any pastas.  I ordered the Bravo! chop salad and a chicken, bacon spinach flatbread (which should be called hot spinach artichoke dip with chicken).  It was really rich and the portion was a monster (I only ate half).  I left full and had dinner for later.  It's a solid."}
{"text":"Really good place. Food was very good, not saw authentic Italian, but very tasty still. Dining room is really nice and the outside is very cool. Covered tables or lounge areas outside. Good bar area and an open kitchen.   Service was ok. Probably the new restaurant and they still need to gel. Went there at lunch and they have brunch along with other meals. Definitely want to go back for those potatoes on the side!!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch, not great."}
{"text":"I met a business partner here for dinner on Sunday at 8PM. We had just put in a 12 hour day and wanted to relax and enjoy a great Italian meal. The place was empty however I am sure they were busy earlier form being Father's Day. The were a lot of employees running around and one other table eating. It took a bit to get our server to acknowledge us. He was a bit cold in his approach. We order a drink which took a bit to get.   I thought it was weird to see a server sitting in the dining room in a chair resting her head on her hand and another eating a Caesar salad at there Expo line or plating area. (This is a health code violation).    My partner order an appetizer and before I could order mine, the server was two tables away in a rush. When he finally got back to where I could get his attention, he told us.\"I wanted to let you know the kitchen closes in a half an hour\". So, we have been there for a half an hour and just ordered appetizers. I calmly told him about our long day and our intentions of not being rushed and we expect a great meal. His comment didn't sit well with us, and as we needed refills on my iced tea we realized this wasn't going to be easy to get.   A few minutes went by, we hadn't received our appetizers and the server came over and asked if we were ready to order. Feeling s rushed now was the final draw. I told him that I was upset and no we will not be ordering. We will eat our appetizers, pay, and leave. I then asked for the manager form a serer that walked by. He went to search for him. She came back a few minutes later and said. \"The manager should be here soon).   When we finally got our appetizers. We ordered their Baked meatballs and an order of Calamari.Calamari Fritti - Creamy horseradish, Pomodoro 12.29, and Meatballs with Polenta Housemade beef and pork meatballs, creamy stone-ground polenta, tomato Marsala sauce 9.99.  They looked great, but when we bit into them they were cold. This ended our dinner experience. The manager came over and ask how our appetizers so we told him about our experience. I do understand why things were so bad, when your leader is in the back tending to things instead of taking care of business r ensuring their team are working. After the manager left because he upset us even more for his lack of professionalism. The server came back and apologized telling us his background where he was a manager at the local WalMart and he was a server trainer for Bravo's. He did pick up all of our check after we insisted in paying. I gust being a manager at a Walmart and a trainer, he should have known he broke so many simple rules of service, Never rush a guest, give excellent service, no excuses, NEVER NEVER tell a guest the kitchen is closing in a half and hour. There was plenty of time for us to get our order in. Pull the cold food and get your manager."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places.  Great bar specials on appetizers. Try the meatball sliders with fries their fries are to die for!  Great pasta all the way around. Unlimited tasty bread for sopping up the great soups."}
{"text":"A disappointment.   I've been to many Bravo locations over the years and have liked them and their food. This location is let down by the service and the food.   The wait staff is generally distracted, and more interested in interacting with each other than with the customers.   The open-kitchen concept is fine with me, but it's way too loud. Sounds like they are dropping cookie sheets on the floor every 30 seconds.  I wet my pants every time they crash something.  Finally, the food is too inconsistent. Cheese is barely melted on the chicken parm, not golden at all. The entree salads are sometimes huge, and sometimes tiny. The greens are the cheap part, so don't skimp on the easy stuff in a $15 salad. It's just lack of attention to detail."}
{"text":"I booked my reservation for dinner an hour before hand and had no problems. When we got there I checked in and waited 5 minutes, while everyone else walking in the door who did not make a reservation had to wait an hour. I had a movie to catch an hour after the reservation was booked and had no stress for making that movie. The service was excellent, we were greeted shortly after being seated and the waitress was very attentive, filling up our drinks without even being asked and taking dishes away as soon as we finished eating. The ambiance was casual yet very nice, perfect for a Valentine's weekend date. The food was very good and came out in a timely manner despite the restaurant being packed. Very pleased with my visit and I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch/brunch on Sunday around 1pm. We were seated on the patio immediately. Our server, Destiny, was great. We ended up ordering off of the brunch menu for the adults and everything was wonderful. It was tough to decide what to get because it all looked good! I ended up ordering the cream cheese waffles with bacon and they were amazing. Mimosas were really good too. My daughter got the GF pasta and loved it...same for my wife and her eggs Benedict biscuit. Surprised by lower ratings for this place, but we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, unable to get the interest of staff to order dinner or get drinks.Several of us left after waiting over 25min at our table.to order and went across the street for dinner because we couldn't get anyone to take our order or to get a drink. It was not crowded at all"}
{"text":"The food was good.  Service was excellent.  Overall not a bad experience but nothing special to brag about."}
{"text":"I've actually been to this restaurant several times over the years and when I think back on it, I've never had a disappointing experience.  On my last visit, nearly two weeks ago, I had a pleasant glass of Chilean Sauvignon Blanc.  I normally like New Zealand SBs, but since they didn't have any on their menu, I branched out to Chile.  Very nice.  I was tired after biking in the pouring rain in the morning and siting on a plane that had no A/C.  Combined with being tired, I was also hungry and was counting on a solid meal.    Bravo came through.  Again.  I went with their signature pasta dish, their Pasta Bravo.  It's rigatoni in a red pepper cream sauce, combined with chicken and mushrooms.  Yum.  Is it the best Italian food I've ever had?  Certainly not, but they have been satisfying and appropriately priced for the quality and portions given.  Top that off with consistent top notch service and you've got a recipe for a four star rating."}
{"text":"Great place for enjoying a glass of wine with friends after work and a light snack, or a great place for a cosy meal.  Really enjoy the bar bites and enjoying a quiet drink with a friend - recommended if you are on the north side of Charlottte."}
{"text":"This Bravo location is next to stellar. We went for dinner yesterday and walked in a few minutes before my husband, since he was coming from work, and decided to grab a drink at the bar. I ordered a dirty martini and it was probably the best that's ever been made. The olives were \"real\" olives... Not polluted with salt. I ordered my drink \"extra dirty\" and it was made just that. $5 was not bad for happy hour. I have to give a shout out to the bartender, who was absolutely on her A-game and sweet as pie. A 5 star experience for sure.  Once my husband came, we were seated at a table. At first though, we were told we had to wait about 20 minutes, so I grabbed another drink. Then suddenly they seated us.. I was a little confused about what was going on and felt bad for the bartender who was unsure whether we were staying or going.   We ordered a calamari appetizer and we got it steamed, not fried. I love that they were able to steam it for us. And the sauce that went with it was outrageously tasty. The marinara was good too. I wasn't a fan of the bread, though. That dipping oil didn't really do it for me. Our dishes came out in a timely manner and were literally steaming hot. I asked for extra garlic in mine and boy, they did not disappoint! Not to compare, but when I go to Olive Garden and request extra garlic in my dishes, they look at me like I have 3 heads.   The booth we were seated in was super spacious and comfortable, as well. Our server was kind and attentive. Although we didn't save room for dessert, I wish we would have because I would have loved to try one of their options. If nothing else, it is definitely worth it to come back for happy hour. I also enjoyed how there were plenty of healthy options on the menu. My husband said he walked by a salad that was enormous and looked delicious.   I noticed the managers walking around, meeting the tables and doing their best to patrol the dining room. I love waking into a place and just sensing that the reason everything runs so smoothly is because of the teamwork and leadership. We originally came here because we had a gift card, but I know we will be back soon, for the reasons listed above."}
{"text":"There are Italian restaurants and then there's Bravo. Beautiful decor. Excellent food. Superb service. We ordered their shrimp pasta with blackened salmon. It was heavenly! The only thing I was surprised is that they didn't have risotto on their menu! I mean, how can an Italian restaurant not serve risotto?"}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere...in the world of casual italian olive garden has a serious competitor"}
{"text":"My Mother and I come here when I am in town visiting. The last two times we've had Bonnie as our server and she is great! We are going to request her again next time. Our food is always consistently good. I recommend any of the salmon dishes, the Chopped salad and Pasta Bravo."}
{"text":"I have been there before with my family and had a wonderful experience every time. However, when I just went today, on a Thursday night, I got seated right away with my boyfriend. It was not busy and there were plenty of open tables. But, after waiting for over 10 minutes for a waitress we felt that we should leave. HORRIBLE SERVICE. I am young, 22 years old, but still feel I should be treated with some respect. Waiters were standing around waiting for guests yet we were unattended for. I won't go back simply because they must feel that they don't need the customers."}
{"text":"The ambience was great, we got to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Had friends visiting from out of town. Busy night as it was prom Took a while for the server to come out and she was quite absent. Very slow service and she was rather inattentive, took a while to come back for our food order after she brought the drinks, which also took a while! Forgot the waters,  got the kids drinks without straws, and never came in check-in to see how we were doing, liking our meals, anything else we needed.!!after having finished dinner we sat for a while before she came to clear the table and didn't even offer dessert or coffee. We had to ask.My shrimp was cold, the meatballs were cold from inside so off night. My friend ordered the homemade fettuccine and that was delicious and so was the Salmon and TIRAMISU!"}
{"text":"I would say 3.7 stars for the food and 4.5 for the service.  They provide a very good customer service eating there but for take out or delivery they usually change the order according to my husband who order few times and always had wrong order.  They always serve a delicious herbs breads to start which is a plus. About the food I would recommend Filet Mignon medium well. Tender, well made, they prepared as I requested.  I also like their atmosphere especially in the day light. They also have table outside during warmers seasons."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! I would defiantly come back for some yummy calamari they have! The reason I am giving a 2 star is because of our waitress..we were with a group of people and I was sitting at the very edge of the table,so whenever I was eating and she needed to refill a drink or serve a plate of food, she would always rudely stretch out her arms in front of my face \"wouldn't be surprised if there ended up some of my makeup on her white sleeve\" and never said excuse me or anything..one time she even almost knocked out my cellphone out of my hands as I was taking a picture..that really pissed me off.. Hope I never have her as my waitress ever again.."}
{"text":"They have gluten free pasta, but only one option-the corkscrew pasta. I had the shrimp scampi. It was good but a small portion. Service was good. The day we went had $5 wine specials, so that was nice also."}
{"text":"Up to four stars as I have re-discovered Bravo!  Bravo for Bravo!  Went to lunch for Dad's 98th birthday.  He said that he was not hungry.  OK...been there before so this was a test of his resolve.  On weekends Bravo! offers both lunch and brunch menus. Excellent way to satisfy diverse tastes as both menus have plenty of choices.  Their best option is the salad plus main course with $11.99 and $12.99 options.  You get a nice sized house salad plus an array of mains.  The bread is served with a herb and sun-dried tomato olive oil with is excellent with the herb-ed bread. The orange color is magnificent.  And so flavorful that you will OD on bread alone.   I ordered the lasagna, as I had it before but was not greatly impressed, but this time it was excellent, well-layered with meat and cheese.  I came piping oven hot and bubbly.  Excellent.  Wife had a rigatoni with a creamy mushroom sauce which was super.  Ate wife's mushrooms, as she does not like them, but I did and do.  Very flavorful and a generous portion.  Dad reluctantly agreed to ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  Mr. \"I'm not hungry\" was seduced by the dish, calmly eating every bite of the four ravioli plus two pieces of bread that he used to sop up the sauce.  He is certainly sold on Bravo! and we came back on a following Sunday for a repeat experience and he really liked the linguini carbonara, also in Alfredo sauce, which got got the bread follow-up phase underway.  I had the ravioli but this time it was a three piece serving with squirts of red and green pesto sauce.  Dad ate half of a ravioli from my plate.  The manager knew it was his birthday, so comp-ted a three part dessert.  What a great dish with three monkey dishes, each different:  a pudding, a creme brulee and a ice cream sundae.  We each tried them all and dad opted for the creme brulee, eating it all.  This is by a guy who was allegedly not hungry!    A coupon for a free item came with the bill, which we certainly kept.    A very nice experience and Bravo! is now back on our repeat visit list. Rates four stars.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious, but expensive. I got the lasagna which was about $19 for a pretty big slice. My little brother got the kids pepperoni Pizza and it was huge, definitely took a to go box home. I believe it cost about $7.  I would definitely come here more often if the prices were lower or someone else was paying :)"}
{"text":"Average to above average in every which way.  Started with caprese salad and wedding soup. Caprese salad was more of a balsamic vin tossed salad w tomatoes and mozz instead of your classic caprese. Mozz also wasn't the freshest. For an entree I had the chicken scallopini which was actually pretty tasty. Chicken was very fresh and the sauce was quite nice, alittle heavy though.   Overall my biggest complaint would be the price of our meal , for the price you pay on an entree it should come with a side and a larger portion. The atmosphere and decor was nice but my girlfriend and I felt the tablecloths were unnecessary in this casual \"olive gardensque\" restaurant and to top it off they were pre-stained with tomato sauce when we sat down.  A decent restaurant I would eat at if there was nothing else nearby of the same stature, but I would not go out of my way to make reservations in the future."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not good enough to merit the price point, herculean effort to find parking, and wait time.  On top of that, it was so loud im there you basically had to yell to carry a conversation."}
{"text":"So given the waitstaff was short this day I will let slide the long wait.  However, the waitress didn't put my order in completely correctly when I asked to sub the type of pasta [I will live] and the spinach tasted unwashed that left a taste of iron in my mouth."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was good, I had the shrimp scampi. A little too soupy the taste was ok. Waitress was ok, took a long time to pick up the check.  She was good though, checked in often and had a pleasant personality. If I'm in the area I give it another try. Bravo is the sister company of Brio in AZ."}
{"text":"No. No. No. Just skip this spot and go anywhere else instead. The mall food court would have been a better a choice. The service was absolutely terrible when I visited. The food was subpar but edible. The bar bites menu is a good value but the service made this visit terrible. I would recommend skipping it."}
{"text":"We reserved a table to celebrate my friend's birthday, and everything during dinner was pretty awesome.  The problem came the next morning when I checked my bank account and realized they charged me triple the amount that my check was for.  I called to let them know, and the host on the phone (Diana) was pretty unfriendly and actually had a \"reason\" for this happening. However, she took down my info and let me know that the GM would be calling me back later.  Since the charge was still pending, I called my bank to let them know what happened.  They let me know that unless someone from Bravo called them, the money would be taken out of my account.  A few hours later,  Diana (the host) called me back and let me know that \"Oh, its been taken care of and the money would be back into my account in a day or so.\" I was really confused about why the GM didn't call me back herself, and why they were so okay with making this mistake.  I let her know that \"A day or so\" wasn't going to fly, especially since this was their mistake.  She transferred me to the GM, who said some pretty scripted apologies and eventually returned the money before dinner hours.  I was shocked at their lack of hospitality and that they would actually blame a guest for THEIR mistake."}
{"text":"We stopped in on sat and it wasn't busy and it took almost fifteen minutes to seat us. The three hostesses ran around and we just stood there. We had a small child with us and that didn't help. The food was fine but the service was slow."}
{"text":"Been dining here since they opened a long time ago. Always fantastic bartenders...Scott, Kareema and Leslie.   They know the menu, how to make a food drink and how to take care of the customers.  I still order the Pasta Mediterranean because above and beyond... the calories are worth it! Vegetarian too!  Picture this... a whole wheat pasta swimming with sundried tomatoes,  pine nuts, garlic, spinach...I always for extra and a rich, flavorful bercy sauce.   Smack the Chef if they won't make it!!! It is to die for!"}
{"text":"I received a gift card for Christmas to Bravo. It's always fun to eat for free, right?  I have been to Bravo's before, but it's been a while. I remember them being a little \"classy\" on the inside. And I was right. The Bravo on McKnight is very classy looking. A very Italian like theme for restaurants. Love the broken looking pillars and beams. But, the bar area compared to other Bravo's I have been to was pretty small. Would have liked to see some high top tables in there and happy hour specials. That's always a win for the \"high priced chains\".  The service...  The service, although a bit slow, was overall pretty good. Our server had a bit of help with food runners and doggy baggers. That's got to be the technical term for that guys job!   Onto the food...  The Spinach Artichoke dip was like eating a crunchy piece of cardboard dipped into watered down spinach. I wasn't a fan of that at all. Their apps were definitely their weak point. The bread and oil had a flavor that I loved. Should have stuck to break and skipped the app. Meals were delicious. I had a veggie pasta, add chicken. My date had Lobster ravioli. I was quite unimpressed with the size of his dish. We are talking 1/3 the portion for his meal that was more expensive than mine. Dessert was delish. We got the cheesecake. Normally I am not a fan of cheesecake. This had a caramelized top with some sort of sauce and a strawberry. Overall, decent, but probably a bit overpriced for what it is. If it weren't for the gift card, I'd probably go for more local, but that's just my preference I guess."}
{"text":"Although I don't feel compelled to yell \"Bravo!\", I can give this highly visible Blakeney Italian Cucina polite applause. We hadn't eaten at this location since it changed from Encore and, to be honest, the only reason we did so tonight, was because we had a BOGO free coupon. I was hoping it would knock my socks off, because the area needs a good Italian restaurant option. Well...  They did get a lot of stuff right starting with our friendly young server, Becca, who was attentive and on task refilling bread and iced tea without us having to ask. She also seemed to have a pretty good grasp of the menu. Her performance took a little dip however, when a party of six moved in beside us.  Food-wise, the bread and accompanying aioli was delicious.Our $4.95 Insalata Della Casa side salads consisted of chopped greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, bacon, crispy pasta and parmesan dressing were just okay as they add also included few pieces of wilty lettuce and the crispy pasta ingredient just didn't work for me.  For our entrees we chose the Chicken Caprese with tomatoes, mozzarella, orzo, farro, spinach, zucchini, pesto vinaigrette ($15.99) and the Spicy Bay Scallop Marinara with capellini, spinach, caramelized onions, artichokes, pesto bread crumbs for ($14.99.) The serving size of both was substantial, which was a good start. We enjoyed both, however, be aware that the Spicy Bay Scallop Marinara is indeed spicy (duh)! The Chicken Caprese is also very tasty but a little heavy on the salt. We skipped their $7 desserts and opted for TCBY.  Of course, anyone who reads my reviews knows sanitation score matters to me in a big way, and theirs was unacceptable 95. Another pet peeve of mine is overpriced beverages, and theirs are pushing it at $3 each and of course no prices were on the menu. Call me cheap, but I hate that trick.  Overall, I would rate it 3.5, but because of Becca I'll give it four stars. Just realize, that's a very generous 4 stars. Still give it a shot, just use coupon."}
{"text":"I've been to Bravo three times, once for dinner and twice for lunch. The food is average and you can get much better tasting Italian food in Charlotte for the same or less $$$. I do like the peach sangria and sitting on the patio. The location is very convenient and there's quite a lot to choose from on the menu. Just wish that the food was either better or the prices were more in line with the quality of the food. Overall, it's okay."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to the Bravo! located on McNight Rd with both being bad experiences.    Parking Lot was poorly lit as none of the lights were working.   The food was simple, boring, and bland.  The order was incorrect.  The bill was incorrect when delivered.  (by $50)  I had the a house special spicy pasta add chicken.  My wife had the same with shrimp.  The dish could have been prepared in 5 minutes by a 12 year old.  There were about three slivers of chicken breast haphazardly cut and dumped on top of some pasta with a spicy sauce.  My wife's shrimp was off tasting and she would no finish her meal.  Later that night she was suffering from gastric distress.    We will never return to Bravo!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gluten free shrimp scampi pasta and absolutely loved it! It was some of the best GF pasta I've had at a restaurant. Between the delicious sauce, juicy shrimp, and the actual pasta, this was a real winner!  There are plenty of gluten free choices on its menu as well as several other dishes that can be made GF."}
{"text":"I went there over a vacation with extended family and my boyfriend and I thought the food was really atrocious.  He ordered a spinach pizza and it tasted like it came out of the microwave.  I ordered the citrus mahi mahi and it was overcooked and dry and the orzo pasta was really salty and unflavorable.  We noticed that a table next to ours had a family that was clearly upset about the service and they even told the manager about how their entrees came out before appetizers.  Our service was mediocre but the food was just not palable in my opinion.  We also asked for an extra dish for someone at our table and we waited forever before the server brought us the dish.  We were not happy with their food."}
{"text":"Food was really good.   Mama's lasagna  bolonese is really hard to beat. It is lasagna loaded with fresh sausage and cheeses then covered in Alfredo sauce.  The portions are huge.  They have expanded menu for low calorie options, but I never thought of this is a good place for a diet.  The fresh bread with dipping oil was really great combo. It would be better if you could put this bread on something called a plate!  Although the  restaurant  wasn't  busy, getting refills on beverages was a wait.  Even better was the wait staff sitting at tables counting tips while customers were eating an hour before closing.  Or employees leaning up against the open kitchen like they are bored.  Of course, watching someone dump the paper table covers and use the side that hit the main walkway to cover someone table didn't help.The staff was friendly but  I can't  get my own stuff here!  I  hope it was a bad night, because it has always been great stop."}
{"text":"Think Olive Garden - if Olive Garden was actually done correctly.  Please don't let the mention of Olive Garden (OG) scare you away.  I used it because OG is a chain and BRAVO! is also a chain.  OG serves \"Italian\" \"food\" and BRAVO! serves Italian cuisine.  I have personally eaten two full entrees and tried three of other peoples.  The salmon on the rice had a great taste.  For better or for worse you will still be hungry after eating it - even if you lick the plate.  I like that it is healthier (I think, so says the menu) and that you can start living your aspiration to not eat until you faint.  Speaking of eating until to you faint - the veal parm is so much food if you eat it all then you should be proud because you accomplished something I couldn't.  It is so much food and so much in the way of calories that I had to take two stabs at it to eat it.  I am not going to even rate the veal parm because it is hard to mess up without burning and it is hard to stand out.  It is a comfort food that you want what you expect.  You will get exactly what you expect from this take on it.  The parking is a problem.  If you don't like to walk and haven't kissed the Blarney stone recently then good luck finding a spot.  You can always find a spot if you are willing to park three or four stores down.  This is not BRAVO!'s fault, this is the Northlake Mall in all its glory (gory).  Related to parking is egress and ingress to the mall - on a busy day you are stuck in a line of cars.  On a really bad day you get to watch fender benders unfold with the police.  This place is solid and don't let my 3 stars scare you away - I am a tough grader.  You have to surprise me and I expect a lot so surprise is really hard.  If you have ever even thought about going to OG then you should forget it and go to BRAVO!  The prices at BRAVO! are a bit higher but there is no comparing the food or the experience."}
{"text":"People say that living in New York changes you, hardens you somehow, makes you cynical. I've never really found this to be true... until my return to Bravo!.  Growing up in the South Hills, Bravo! was one of my favorite chains. It was fancy, it had table clothes, it was better than the Olive Garden. I recall being mildly obsessed with the chopped salad, so upon my recent return I ordered a half-sandwich and the salad for a light lunch.  I was disappointed that the salad was full of soggy ice-berg lettuce and a few off-season tomatoes. The turkey-bacon-avocado sandwich was disappointing as well, with just a few chunks of cubed avocado overwhelmed by a flavored aioli.  I guess I've been spoiled by having a huge variety of A+ Italian Bistros at my disposal,  but there is waaaay better Italian to be had in the 'burgh. Skip the big box chains and head to your local red-sauce joint. Its likely to be cheaper, more delicious, and lacking giant faux-Roman columns with doubtful structural integrity."}
{"text":"Very slow inefficient service. Food was good.  Went at 5 on a Wednesday, told the wait was 15 to 20 minutes though the restaurant was half empty. I assume poor management."}
{"text":"Good environment. Average Italian food at reasonable price. Recommend their dessert."}
{"text":"You really can never go wrong with Italian - chain or non-chain. I don't go to Bravo that often, so when I get a chance to go, it's a nice treat. My friend and I decided to stop here before we went to a concert. I ordered the Eggplant Parm and it was above average. For one, it wasn't drenched in sauce and it was lightly breaded. It came with a side of linguine (my favorite) in an herb sauce. It was the perfect mix and I brought half of it home.   My friend and I decided to share their Nutella Pudding.... yes you read that right....NUTELLA pudding! I LOVE anything involving Nutella, and this was amazing.   If you're heading to the Waterfront, this is a great place to stop. On the weekends it's a bit busier and a longer wait, but just like any Italian dinner, what's the rush? Mangia!!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been in Bravo it probably over 10 years so even though I try to stay away from chain restaurants I knew I had to eventually give in and go here for my fiance (he has been asking to go).   I started with their gimlet, which was pretty good! I knew I had to try their Insalata Della Casa, as I love chopped salads and this was also pretty good. We got our bread and dipping oil a little late, and I kind of wish we would have just skipped it. It was a little underwhelming.   For dinner I had the Chicken Scaloppini, and it was good, again not really all the memorable, but good. The chicken could have used a little life..it was pretty sad looking..   I ended the night with a Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee, which was probably my fave part of the meal and I'm not even that big of a sweets person.   All in all it was an OK meal, but I definitely won't be rushing back anytime soon. :)"}
{"text":"For March Break (the perks of being a teacher), I decided to drive down to North Carolina from my humble abode in Toronto. After driving for a good five hours, I found myself in Cranberry Township for the night. The hotel where I was staying had a promotional offer - as a guest at the Holiday Inn Express, I was entitled to a 10% discount on a meal from Bravo Cucina Italiana.   As previously mentioned, this is a \"chain\" and there are five locations throughout the Pittsburgh area. The restaurant is very, very clean (including the washrooms). The staff are all professional and courteous. Pricing of the food is very reasonable. Dinner for three totaled approximately $45.   We were happy with our selection and would recommend the following:  - Eggplant Parmigiana, it comes with a fettuccine Alfredo pasta side, which is delicious  - Pepperoni and Banana Pepper Pizza, it is extremely hot!  - Pasta bolognese, it is simple, but good.   I don't see myself back any time soon; however, this is purely due to the fact that I don't live in Pittsburgh nor do I go to Pittsburgh often."}
{"text":"Ah, home sweet home.. the land of very few dining options. Pittsburgh is host to a plethora of low-end chain restaurants with a never ending amount of blah to offer. Thankfully Bravo! offers better ambiance and savory fare several steps above your neighborhood Applebee's. I had the Petit Fillet with Jumbo Shrimp and was happy with my choice. If you're in the Ponderosa/Sizzler state of mind, this isn't the place for you. If you want something nicer (and a wee bit pricier), Bravo! is where you want to go. Good for families/groups of 6+ as well. They're sprinkled throughout Steeler country, so find one near you."}
{"text":"We are pretty much regulars at Bravo. One reason is that we were allowed to bring a bottle of wine in with us. We would usually sit at the kitchen counter and take our time eating, usually 3 courses and a few other drinks in between. We hated to eat slow and take up a table. We also tip very well since we are there for a while. We arrived on Sun night and sat at the counter with our wine. We ordered drinks and then the manager came up and said that no bottles were allowed anymore. I asked if we could have the bottle we brought in and were told no. I can understand the new policy, even thought I will not go there anymore, but by not allowing us to have the bottle we brought in one last time was insulting. We left carrying our bottle like we did something wrong and we will not return. Very poor way of handling the situation. Many other good Italian restaurants to frequent."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going to Bravo at The Waterfront (we had a gift card) for our 39th anniversary on May 26th. We were rushed and treated like we were a bother.  While the food was okay, it left an oily taste and feel in my mouth.Then I fell outside when their railing come apart - the bolt was missing. (I had just put my hand on it and when it fell apart and I went with it. Two ladies walking past me grabbed me from behind and kept me from completely crashing into the tables. I hurt my leg in 4 places and cut a finger. Nothing really serious, but it never should have happened. The bolt (or whatever) that holds the hinge together was missing. Management offered to call an ambulance (which I declined) and filled out an accident report. Unfortunately, before we had the presence of mind to take a picture, one of the managers put the hinge back in, declaring it fixed. Hell, no, that's not fixed. Nothing was securing the hinge!  We were told that the restaurant and Corporate would be calling  - sure cover their behind! I am angry - bruised and sore and now with open (burst) blisters. It never should have happened. By the way, it's the evening of the 29th and we have not heard from either the restaurant or Corporate. What a bunch of baloney!  Big deal - he gave us a couple gift cards for free apps and dessert.  Who cares?!?  Sorry we didn't celebrate at one of our favorite restaurants where they really care about their customers."}
{"text":"Never a bad. No- Never even a mediocre meal. True Italian. Great Severs!  Beer is Cold. Ice tea is real. Had Veal  Parmesan . OMG. Real Baked not deep fried.  Wife had spag. & meatballs. Spicey with sausage I'm sure. Perfect. Thanks"}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch here on Saturday afternoon. Was set on having lunch and then saw brunch was until 3! Tried an omelette which was seasoned well and hearty. They were busy during my visit but well staffed which allowed us to be seated promptly and feed quickly!"}
{"text":"Dinner there last night after watching Haywire at Loews. Boy the wait to get in was long, but that is not new. I tried the call ahead before the movie started and could not get anything for a party of 5 earlier than 9. So we just walked in and got in the queue with a 1/12 - 2 hr wait. I put my name in and began using Yelp on my iPhone to find the numbers of the \"nearby' restaurants. Well darn, they all had similar wait times. So we had a drink and luckily we were seated in 1 hour. Whew. Lemon drop martinis were popular at the table last night. Everyone said they liked them. I just had a Grey Goose.  Salads were good especially the Bravo Chopped Salad which contains a delicious mix of chopped greens, cucumber, red onion, tomato, olives, Feta cheese and Italian dressing. Their Wedding soup was delicious as usual. For entrees I had Chicken Marsala which had a great tasting sauce, yummy mushrooms and moist tender chicken. I recommend this. Linda had the beef gnocchi, with slow roasted beef, which she said was wonderful and for her, there was enough to bring some home. Other had the eggplant parm, sausage tortellini and angel hair bolognese. I have had the bolognese before and I can attest to how good it is. We always enjoy Bravo even with the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch last week, and I was pleasantly surprised! Haven't been to Bravo in many years and I was impressed by their menu selection. I had the salmon salad, and it was done to perfection. Thanks for a great visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place with fresh warm rolls at your table and a side plate of sauce with spices. The food is always good never disappointed and the serves are always on the the ball moving quickly while still being nice, I would  recomend this to anyone on a weeknight or a weekend"}
{"text":"I ate at Bravo last Friday night before going over to the improv for a late night show. My husband and I arrived at 7:30 pm and were told that it would be about 10 minutes for a table. Within 10 minutes we were seated and greeted by our server. Not bad at all for a busy Friday night. This was by no means our first trip to Bravo, but we had not been there for over a year.   The service was excellent. Our waiter casually chatted with us about my pregnancy and his children while we waited for our dinner guests who were 15 minutes late. I ordered the chopped salad with italian vinagarette and the shrimp fra diavalo (sp?) for my entree. Our salads came out rather fast but there did seem to be a delay in our entrees. We happily muched on the delicious bread and dip (my favorite thing about Bravo!) while we waited. When our entrees did arrive, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of shrimp in my dish. Typically, a pasta dish will have about 4-8 good sized shrimp. My Shrimp fra Diavalo had upwards or 10 shrimp! The pasta was cooked well but, I was rather disappointed in the sauce. Based on the name of the dish, I was expecting a little spice. Unfortunately, the sauce was rather bland and tasted like a generic tomato cream sauce. For dessert, I ordered the small chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The contrast between the warm cake and the cold ice cream was delectable. The portion size was also perfect for one. All in all, a good place to eat while at the waterfront."}
{"text":"Food was good. Reminds me of an upscale olive garden. Better drinks, better portions, prepared in an open kitchen. Prompt service and friendly atmosphere. Only down side is that it is a chain and the food is as such. Not a downfall, just as expected. All around a good experience."}
{"text":"They have an awesome patio and a happy hour on Friday... The pasta  was excellent and they have delicious bread..   The downside was the service... The service was extremely slow very frustrating. Not sure I will come back. Then we where over charged for our meal..."}
{"text":"I must start by saying we have always loved Bravo.  Today, we went there and was seated outside.  We sat for 15 minutes and no server.  The couple that came after us was waited on first....still no server.  I went inside to ask if they forgot us....the fella said, this has been happening a lot for they just had major cuts....well one could tell..... uncleared dishes every where. After 5 more minutes, we left.  Bravo please get your act together....we love it there."}
{"text":"I along with 20 other guests were here attending a birthday dinner here at Bravo on a Saturday night.   It was an early dinner that was reserved for 5:30PM.. At first, our waitress seemed to have everything together. She got our drink order fairly quickly. I ordered the flirty cosmo cocktail which was fabulous. For dinner, I tried one of their new features,  Stuffed Shrimp Scampi made with orzo, farro, zucchini, roasted peppers, spinach and lemon butter. It came with a choice of soup or salad and I ordered a small bowl of wedding soup. I really enjoyed my soup and entree.  Very light and tasty and I would definitely order it again. You got all of this for $12.99.  The only negative comment I have was the service itself. If you plan on coming here on the weekend, you may want to keep your schedule open. There were tons of big parties this particular night and our waitress seemed to be very overwhelmed. We could see her running back and forth many times trying to catch up. Remember when I said that our reservation was at 5:30PM? We didn't leave out of there until 9:30PM and that was not because the conversation at the table was so good. We were waiting! Waiting to place food orders, waiting for the checks, waiting, waiting, waiting. I was hoping I would have been out of there by 7PM at the latest. I'm sure it wasn't solely our waitress fault. I'm sure the kitchen was backed up and all of the staff were sharing just 2 computers to place orders and print checks.  Like I said, BRAVO was packed with dinner guests. Altogether, I would definitely come back, just probably not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had a great first time experience at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana. We were at Northlake and wanted to try something new, but I wanted Italian. This place was right these, so we gave it a try. I am sure glad we did, cause WOW. I enjoyed the service, the atmosphere, and most importantly the food. Everything tasted great, tasted freshly prepared and was just as we ordered it. My wife had the chicken parmesan, which they do call something else here. I had the pesto chicken which I really enjoyed. The server was really great, made the whole first timer experience go very smoothly."}
{"text":"Bravo, isn't really the traditional Italian where you can find traditional Italian items such as Veal Parmesan, Chicken Francese and sort..   We went for Memorial Day dinner.  I started off with Lobster Bisque, and yes.. it is heavenly! the taste- the texture- and the presentation is way beyond my expectation. I would go back for this soup!   for my main course, I had Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka.  It was not the best, but its edible! edible enough to eat! few bites, and you're done! it's not something you'd be dying for or something dish you'd crave for again the next day! it didn't quite give the flavor I wanted in fact, it's overwhelming that you'd rather stop after couple of bites.. or else you'd be throwing up!   The Creme Brûlée for Dessert, is fantastic! must try!   The service, isn't the greatest! took about 20mins to get the appetizers! and another 30minutes for the main course! it's like we have the entire year waiting! it's not that busy either! but ok i'll give it that maybe because it's the holiday!"}
{"text":"This is a good solid Italian restaurant on the North side of town. Everything is solid I have yet to get a bad meal here. They even have a few really great menu items that I crave. For apps I love the fried ravioli with an amazing dipping sauce.  For the Salad they make a romain salad with tomatoes, pancetta and creamy garlic  dressing. My wife will crave that salad  and we pull in just for that. I love the bolognese sauce with spaghetti noodles. Classic and simple but the flavor is robust. This is my wifes favorite restaurant in the Northlake area and hungry or we always take home the tiramasu.  It may be the main reason I never get to go to P.F. Changs when I am with my wife."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner for take out, bread was awesome. Chicken parmesan was dry, disappointed. Quality does not live up to price. Prices are inflated. Keep driving down Washington Rd. il Pizziola is incredible!"}
{"text":"Great service, okay food. I came here for lunch and was surprised that they have a brunch menu which ends at 3:00 pm. I got the eggs,bacon, and potatoes but it tasted just okay. My husband got the spaghetti and felt his was just okay as well. The service however was great. Our waiter checked on us continuously making sure everything was okay and we never had to request a refill he always made sure our drinks were filled."}
{"text":"The food at this location is so bland! We love the location so Inhave tried it severL times hoping they have improved but each visit the food tastes like bland frozen dinners. If you are looking for good Italian head to Oggi."}
{"text":"I attended a bridal shower at this location and I was very impressed with the organization of the service staff. All of the food came out in a timely manner, it was hot, drinks were refilled continually, and they handled my food allergies with ease despite it being a fixed menu. I would highly recommend the private room for a special occasion! It has a nice view of the patio and has doors that close for extra privacy. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to a BRAVO and loved the whole experience from the moment I walked in the door with a girlfriend for a girls night out.   My friend suggested the restaurant for dinner and wine. I made a reservation with open table to gain more points and use my $20 gift card from open table.   It was such a good night! The restaurant was mostly empty, many dinners choice to eat outside, it was a nice warm evening for it.   We started with bread and oil. I ordered the Chicken - Bacon  Flatbread, I also ordered a Caesar Salad and Wedding Soup EXCELLENT! The soup reminded  me of the Wedding Soup we used to order at Johnny Carinos, I so miss that restaurant in Monroeville.   The Moscato Wine was very tasty ! I had Two glasses.   My girlfriend ordered, The Bravo Pasta dish, she offered a taste, it was delicious  !!   The atmosphere and service I enjoyed.   I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and I know we will return. I will return with family as well.  UPDATE:   Second dinner - Birthday celebration bring us back  Excellent service and dinner as first time.  Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Typical chain Italian food.  That being said, it is much better than Olive Garden.  The food tastes better and is fresh, there are more selections on the menu, and the portions are larger.  We had great service too.    This time I had the Chicken Fra Diavolo.  It had a great little spice to it but even getting double the chicken (for a $2.99 upcharge) there was not a lot of chicken in the meal."}
{"text":"A simple dish of oil. A perforated loaf of herb crusted bread. An old-world style dish of spaghettini and Italian meatballs. The smells of amour and fresh linen. This is Bravo! This... this was my lunch.  My tastebuds were watering from the moment my eyes met the building exterior.  As my family entered the establishment, we were greeted by two lovely young ladies. One had a small zodiac tattoo behind her ear. We were seated by the windows overlooking the walkway terrace.   My cousin ordered the shrimp scampi, my brother had the chicken parmesan, and I opted for the classic spaghettini and meatballs.  Regrettably, the scampi was served in a butter sauce that \"lacked a distinct flavor\". I also received reports from my sister that her portion was \"not big\".  Now, the spaghettini and meatballs. Apparently spaghettini is a shorter noodle with smaller diameter. The flavor of the tomato sauce was indulgent but not overpowering. The meatballs were certainly the star of the plate. A wonderful crust on the outside with a tender and flavorful interior. Had the portion been a bit bigger or the price a bit smaller, Bravo! would have a perfect plate on their hands.  The chicken parm was \"good\".  I feel strong in my evaluation of three stars. Main factors were portion consistency, overall taste, servers, aesthetic, and pricing. I would happily return to Bravo! with appropriate expectations."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is... But my experience here was, umm quite interesting. I guess coming on Christmas Eve wasn't the best idea? Because right from the get go when we walked into the restaurant I felt that we were met with some stupidity.  Let me set the scene here. Envision a restaurant, about 3/4 empty, and a hostess as well as a manager in the front standing to greet customers. We walk in and we're greeted with the standard: \"How are you? What can we do for you?\" of course the easy reply: \"We have 4.\" Now, the following response started getting me worried. \"Did you make a reservation?\" REALLY?! So, you're telling me that at 7:30 PM on Christmas Eve, we need a reservation when the restaurant is 3/4 empty? Are they going to rush in at 7:45 and fill up the restaurant?   Anyways, we got seated. When we got seated, my worries had came back in full. Waiter comes up: \"Hello. You're my last table here, and I'm ready to get out of here because it's Christmas Eve and I have a lot of things to do at home.\" My thoughts: \"WTF?!\" and I was about to respond \"Well, if you need to go home, go. I'll find another waiter who wants my tip.\" But, I sat silently because what I just was absurd and I was not going to play along with ridiculousness.  Placed our order. I ordered the Chicken Pomodoro Pasta. Food was great, we also ordered some bruschetta which was amazing. I did order a salad along with my entree but it came out cold and soggy. I guess I'm too picky as far as salads go, but I do like it crisp.   We get to the end of the meal (which was amazing by the way). Our waiter gets the check and gives it to us. My Mom jokingly says: \"Well, we better leave so you can get home.\" She then continues and says: \"Yeah, my brother came up from Florida and I haven't spent any time with him! I also have so many presents to wrap, and the bosses who own this franchise don't understand that we need to be home too. They're with their families somewhere in Colorado, and we're here working.\"   You're joking right? I didn't even look at her, and my parents already stood up and were leaving when she was in half sentence. If you don't want to make money on Christmas Eve, then don't come! I'm sure someone else would love to take that from your hands to make some extra cash for Christmas. Blaming the restaurant that is giving you a job is not a good look, on top of blaming it in front of patrons of the restaurant.  All in all, this place would have been an easy 4 if we had the right attitudes and intelligence as far as services go. The food here saved it from a 2 star. Service was poor, but maybe it was because it was Christmas Eve? Who knows? All I know is that I was definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent balsamic chicken and asparagus.  Our server Adam got us in and out in 45 minutes on a Friday night and helped us get to our Show on time!  Well done."}
{"text":"Received a gift card from my employer and boy am I grateful. The food was fantastic...my server was so polite with extra smiles. I couldn't give it five starts because I didn't get a drink(and I'm honest so that's how I give or take away a star). But I will be going back to see if they deserve it which I'm pretty sure they will. Took a order home and it was just like I ate it off the plate in the restaurant. Their sauce is so good and doesn't leave a bitter taste in your mouth as I've experienced in most \"top\" Italian restaurants. Also grate ambiance and location"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with family and friends out on the patio.  Got the Bravo pasta and it basically was similar to a penne vodka. The fried ravioli appetizer was fantastic! Great outdoor space and looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant located in the middle of Pittsburgh on the grounds of the former US Steel Homestead Works where they made the steel that won WWII I should be able to get an Iron City product. No regular, no light. Shame on Bravo.  Food was OK. Took a long time to get entree at 5 pm. Service average. Will I return? Not any time soon."}
{"text":"While visiting the area, we stopped here for what turned out to be a disappointing visit.    Despite seeing hit and miss yelp reviews, we visited as it was close to our hotel.  First off, parking is an issue at this restaurant.  We had to circle the restaurant several times and wound up waiting for a spot to open up, which it eventually did.    Upon entering the restaurant, we were \"greeted\" by a older hostess whose only greeting was an expressionless \"How many?\".  Upon getting her answer, she turned and started to walk away.  Should we follow her? Is she checking on what tables are available?  Well, she had menus in her hand, so we followed.  She deposited the menus on a table and walked away.  Not an auspicious start.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive however.  The bread that was served was warm, fresh, and quick.  My wife's salad start was good.  My lobster bisque however did not taste fresh and was a thicker than I've had in other places.  Not terrible, just not something that I would order again.    On to the main courses: My wife also enjoyed her Lasagna dish.  Unfortunately, my Veal Parmigiana was horrible.  There was something off with the veal that I can best describe as really stale breading on old meat.  My wife was not happy with me for the taste testing sanity check I inflicted on her.  I returned the entree after two bites.    To her credit, the restaurant manager came over and did all the right things.  She showed genuine concern in understanding what was wrong with the meal.  The item was taken off the bill, an offer to make something different was made, and a coupon to be used on a future visit was provided.  Bravo to her!  Unfortunately, our waiter must have been offended that we returned something as the previously attentive service grew decidedly frosty.    To summarize, our experience mirrors the reviews that you'll find on this restaurant.  Some folks love it, some pan it.  Our hit and miss experience during our visit backs this up."}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful ambience! The food has an authentic fresh quality! I'm thinking about a bowl of spaghetti as I review! I had a shrimp appetizer ( actually the table kept them coming like 6) also a chicken flatbread (delish)! I had a chicken salad and a shrimp pasta dish both of which were delectable. The service was good too."}
{"text":"The food could be way better.  The pizza, spinach and most entrees are glistening with oil. Greasy food  Drinks not good, no top shelf tequila served .   Go to Taco Bell across the street"}
{"text":"Tasty Caesar salad. Shrimp scampi wasn't anything to come back for . Bread sticks were ok. Nothing special. Service ok. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Bravos around the Pittsburgh area and this one wasn't the greatest, but they were trying very hard!  2 people at 2 different tables either got the wrong thing or sent their food back. Mine and my boyfriend's food was ok, but not great.  I feel like their portions may have been small as well, but that's fine with me.   The manager apologized multiple times to the lady behind me and the waitress, while very nice!, just kept saying I'm sorry,  I've only been here from a week, which makes me think they must have a high turn around.   We probably won't be back :-/"}
{"text":"My family was hungry for Italian and decided to go to this place one night.  Overall, I thought this place was decent, but it would not be one of my top places to have Italian (It has potential though).  Our waiter was good, the prices were fair, the place looked fancy, and and it was pretty packed.   As far as food, their bread was great and was made better with their oil sauce.  The salted caramel martini was delicious, especially coming from someone who does not drink often.  The spinach and artichoke dip was probably the best thing I had due the pita bread (you could taste the pasta herb seasoning although there was a bit too much pita though).  The Caprese salad was good, but there was nothing too special about it.  For the main course, I had the Pasta Fra Diavolo with Chicken, and it was pretty good.  However, it is something I would not order again.  The sauce had a good tinge of spiciness and  was tasty after some bites, but it was not that much enjoyable after you finish the chicken.  It probably could be improved if a veggie or something was added to give some texture.  I may try this place again in future, but we will have to see."}
{"text":"Dirty dishes. Dirty glasses.  Bread plates had food encrusted on them. I showed it to the waitress and she brought clean ones. But then gave us 2 wine glasses that were so grimey that the bottoms stuck to the tablecloth. I could actually see someone's lipstick on my glass. They were filthy. GROSS!  When we pointed out how dirty our wine glasses were to our waitress she said, \" I will have to talk to the kitchen about changing the water in the dishwasher.\"  WHAT? !  Does that mean they reuse the water in the dishwasher?! That's disgusting. She brought new wine glasses that were pristine clean. But..... having to inspect all my dishes and glasses before I touch them is not what I consider to be a pleasant dining experience. This place obviously has poor cleanliness standards. I do not recommend going there. There was no apology for the filth. In fact,  the waitress didn't seem one bit surprised that our dishes and our glasses were filthy."}
{"text":"My wife and I own and operate a business together. Our business relies heavily on uniform customer service. I've had customers walk in late, it's not fun. How you assess and treat them makes the difference between a positive review and a poor one. So when my wife and I stopped in an hour before close at Bravo Cucina Italiana, I expected sparse clientele, but expected good food and service none the less.We work long hours and barely get to celebrate the fruits of our accomplishments, but on the evening of our eighth anniversary, I'd hoped only for a quiet meal and not to be rushed. The hostess' demeanor was a perfect match for her dark, disheveled hair and makeup. She made it plain that she was not happy to have our patronage at that time. Her attitude and sour glances at check in and throughout dinner were enough to ruin any hope of a bit of peace at the end of our day. The shining jewel of the service was Tori our waitress. She held the balance between pressure from management and her obligation to treat us well, impeccably. I had a phenomenal gluten free pasta dish and my wife had her usual. Tori; thanks for the great service. The rest of you... so sorry to bother you at an inconvenient time.  Josh"}
{"text":"Ok where do I begin, I suppose when we first walk in Bravo we were greeted by an unfriendly not smiling grumpy, snotty,  nose in the air girl named Caitlyn this is the hostess I mean first impressions are everything.  When we visit Pittsburgh we like to dine at Bravo because the food is good but next time we will not be back because of the crappy service.    First of all my fiancée was told it would be a 45min wait  I use opentable for everything ( when it's available ) so we actually already had reservations but the lady was not listening to us and couldn't find our name in the system.  After the manager overheard her she looked & said Caitlyn the reservation is right here and I'll seat them right away. She gave us the biggest eye roll ever  ! So rude  We're seated right away by Sara who's apologized at least 5 x already and really it's ok thank you for making it right.  She brings 2 teas 1 lemonade and my vino, the teas were good nice and dark the lemonade was fresh, I guess the accidentally poured 2 glasses so I got 1 free I'm ok with that   Now Alex comes over I think he's the manager and he said he overhead the hostess being rude and apologized so he offered us any appetizer of our choice for free.  Very kind of him   We picked the chicken, bacon, spinach & cheese flat bread.  Omg am I glad we did because it was Delish  Nice and crunchy corners soft middle, bacon cooked to perfection  enough to feed 3 men and a little lady.    My Entree: very good fresh Brussel sprout & almond salad with a lemon vinaigrette.  Super fresh greens with tender chicken added   Italian wedding soup: it could have been warmer since it was freezing outside, carrots, little meatballs orzo and a yummy broth was all swimming around in my cute little soup bowl.  I can't complain to much it was yummy   The Bravo Spaghetti that was brought out to my brother in law looked very good, thin noodles a medium amount of meat sauce he said it was tasty a solid 7 !  My man had the Bolognese, again very tasty, nice portion size, the noodles cooked to perfection. A solid 9!   My son had the chicken Caesar salad he loved it nice fresh chicken and lettuce was fresh   So the food was great but the service sucked in the beginning,  however the management teamed up and took great care of us ! So Bravo to the management at Bravo  you did a great job but we might just visit a different location next time we're in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"The service and food was okay. I've been here two times in the past and  I was pleased with my food. I will definitely stick with what I know, which is the pasta BRAVO is one of the best pastas on the menu. During this visit I tried the Pasta Fra Diavoli and it was bland. The bread and seasoned oil was tasty as usual. My server appeared rushed and lacked enthusiasm, wasn't sure if he actually wanted to be at work that day. Mind you the restaurant wasn't packed, just a normal crowd. Anyhow I'm a pasta lover and this place is close to my house so I'll probably end up visiting in the future to get the pasta Bravo."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this shopping mall small chain? Restaurant.  Everyone liked their food.  Big menu (which sometimes doesn't work well) offered a lil something for very different tastes.  Salmon salad was really good - I ate it pretty much without dressing - offered dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette.  Would have preferred lemon with this. But loved the crunch of the stix - sounds weird but it was good.  Daughter loved her French toast, which had a filling.  Will return if shopping in the area.  Very  reasonably priced."}
{"text":"In town traveling for business. Walked in and sat at the bar for dinner. Two bartenders. Sat there for over five minutes and was not even acknowledged. A couple came in and sat next to me and were immediately greeted and given menus. Meanwhile, I was still not acknowledged. I got up and walked out. I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Another great experience at this Bravo! location. From our server Sarah K (one of the friendliest servers I can remember) to the manager (Gabrielle) this lunch was outstanding.   Everything was fresh ( the flatbread appetizer and the Parmesan crusted chicken salads). The bread was fresh out of the oven and the oil/spice mix was finally to our liking (more spice than normal).. Definitely worth the trip..."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Sherry! We came in for a small date night and saw our server had a party of at least 25. She was still soooo amazing in providing service to us without letting her party wait or us. That's amazing. Entrees were delicious, appetizer absolutely wonderful, and dessert topped off the whole meal. I will request Sherry every time, she is the best service I have encountered at any business!"}
{"text":"This place is low rated for a reason! Service is terrible, manager is an a hole. Overprice low quality food! Save yourself the trouble please!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a going away dinner for a colleague who was retiring.  There were 23 in our party.  I had contacted another establishment in the area a month before to make sure they could accommodate us and the day of was told they wouldn't guarantee we would all be seated in the same area.  I called Bravo in the Waterfront the day of the dinner and spoke to Megan Graves, the Service Manager.  She arranged for us to have 2 tables side-by-side, we were able to order off the regular menu AND we were allowed to do separate checks.  In less than 24 hours, Megan and our servers Lauren and David, gave our colleague the retirement dinner I had hoped for and we all had a wonderful time!  Megan and her staff should be applauded for their wonderful service and willingness to work with a customer at the last minute to make a truly memorable evening!  I can't thank them enough!"}
{"text":"Made reservations in March 2016 for a rehearsal dinner on July 8, 2016 , also called to confirm a week prior to the event of 18-20 people was told everything was in place.  Had originally discussed with the manager the event , he stated we would love the setting and we would be in a four half wall enclosed area for the event.  Got there this Friday night, and was immediately told by the hostess that we were late that we were scheduled to arrive at 5 pm, I had not once mentioned a 5 pm start time, it was originally to be at 6 pm but had to change it to 7 pm due to the rehersal time being changed, I had called to change this time and also confirmed that.  We were seated literally in the kitchen area, I understand it is an open kitchen style restaurant, but the area we were seated in appeared to be not utilized by customers at all, we were crammed together at our table so tight that you could barely move your arms.  There was water all over the floor by myself ( mother of the groom) and the brides parents, the server stations were right behind our heads.  It was so loud and when the bride and groom attempted to speak to thank everyone and pass out gifts at the table you could not even hear them speak.  The staff did try to make amends but it was too late for that, this was an epic fail on all levels.  Ruined an event that we can never redo.  I would never recommend this for events of any kind, and no one of the two managers I spoke with openly took responsibility for the issues, they basically passed the buck that it was someone else's fault.  They did adjust the bill and offered free appetizers, but this was not helping the event.  I had worked so hard for this wedding and did not even eat there that evening because I was so upset, the two bites of food that I did take were awful as well, this place is a step below an Olive Garden , and I'm Italian and not really a fan of their food either. All thanks for nothing BRAVO, thanks for ruining our event."}
{"text":"Bravo and Brio (in Legacy Village) are actually part of the same chain. The menus are very similar, with a little more pasta at Bravo and more meat at Brio, but basically the same idea. Brio always seemed a little fancier (maybe it is the location) but the prices are similar. Bravo always seems a little less busy, less noisy, and with more parking available.   The food is good, very good even, although they don't have the italian favorites I always look for (fettucini alfredo - or if they do have  it, it wasn't memorable). The steak is excellent, if a little small. They seem to have very few vegetarian options, although their salads are very delicious, cold and very fresh.  However, both restaurants seem to have the same issue - the service. At both there have been long lines, long waits, friendly servers who forgot things or spilled food on us. The management here is pretty good, so if there is a problem they will take care of you (hello playing the free food lottery). As long as you know this in advance, there is nothing to really complain about (I have witnessed several other parties complain and be very upset but we always know there is a chance the service will be terrible).  Overall, not exactly the best Italian food but a good time."}
{"text":"A surprisingly delicious find at Northlake Mall! Even though there's an Olive Garden not too far from the mall, I urge you to try Bravo! if you're in the area craving Italian.  It's a beautiful restaurant on the inside as much as it is on the outside. The outside is flanked with patio lights and the inside has a warm, curl-up-by-the-fireplace kind of atmosphere. A great place for a date night, girls' night, or family night.  For my visit, I met a friend for dinner and cocktails. I started with the white peach sangria (which I felt wrong doing at an Italian restaurant but it tasted sooooo right!) and ordered the chicken fra diavolo. I didn't find the fra diavolo to be spicy at all, I wish it had more heat. My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and thoroughly enjoyed her dish.   From the hostesses at the door to the waitress we had, everyone was extremely sweet and courteous. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation at bravo for my grandmothers birthday. It was an early dinner but of course everyone was late. The hostess was very nice and let us sit at our table since it was ready for us. Our server on the other hand was very unwelcoming. Petite blonde who was obviously not in the mood to work a large party. I asked for her to bring bread and water for everyone as we were still waiting for many of our guests to arrive. After half of our party showed we ordered appetizers and cocktails.   Mini calzones about the size of a beef patty. Deliciously stuffed with different cheeses. Dipping sauce on the side.    Fried calamari was cooked just right and came with a marinara and cream sauce. Typical calamari wasn't bad but wasn't anything special.   Spinach dip was really good and cheesy. They added red peppers to it which gave it a nice kick.   Things were looking up as we enjoyed our apps and drinks. Then a new server popped up and we were confused. So we asked what happen and she was honest and told us the blonde was complaining about us. Funny thing is my boyfriend could hear her while she was standing all the way by the kitchen talking about how we weren't ordering enough drinks. Mind you it's my grandmothers birthday, not exactly the moment to turn up. We were happy to have Natasha as our new server! She was very polite and patient. Did not rush us and made sure our experience was pleasant so that we MIGHT want to come back again. Not going to elaborate on the entrées they were mediocre. Lobster ravioli was the best dish I tasted out of everyone's."}
{"text":"Really good food. I think they were struggling just a bit because of a larger party but it did not affect the food quality. I had the Bravo! Chopped salad with Chicken Caprese. Wonderful!My husband had the Chicken Parmesan and came in a huge portion. Both of us have leftovers for the next day! Definitely not a weekly trip but special occasions."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to Blakeney! After disappointing visits to Encore, I was excited to see this place open, and I wasn't disappointed. As others have noted, they really opened up the inside so you can see the whole dining area when you walk in. Before, you felt really isolated on that side.   A girlfriend and I went on a Tuesday after work for the bar happy hour. They got rid of a lot of bar tables, but the outside looked much more inviting. However, we sat at the bar.  The specials were pretty awesome - drinks and food anywhere from $4-$6 each - so we split a caprese salad, beef carpacchio, and spinach and artichoke dip. The dip was solid, but the salad was so good, I even ate tomatoes, which is rare. The carpacchio was one of the better ones I've had... I was surprised!  Service was a little spotty, but realizing they had just opened, I'm guessing they'll get into a groove soon."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about Bravo!  I love the lasagna but i can never finish it. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went here for a special evening with my mom. It is Restaurant Week so we took advantage of the $30 menu. The portions were large my mom had the salmon and I had the Chicken Milanese.     I had the Italian Meatball soup. A little salty but good. And my mom had the calamari which was De-Lish.   The Salmon was cooked perfectly and came over a bed of mixed veggies and sweet potatoes.   I had the chicken milanese which was pretty good. The Chicken breast (*side eye* *cough* patty) looked as if it came from the freezer but was still ok and got the job done.   For dessert I'd originally wanted the creme brûlée, which was the only non-chocolate option, but they were out so my server offered a no bake cheesecake which was perfect and my mom had the warm chocolate cake.   Out server was attentive keep our glasses full and gave us great space. All dished came out perfectly arranged and within good timing."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before, so my husband made reservations for us one night. Everything we got was delicious and the server we had was wonderful (I feel terrible that I can't remember her name)!   The only reason for 4 stars is because it is rather expensive for what it is (I don't understand why pasta and chicken cost $17, especially when there wasn't a lot of chicken in the dish)..... And the hostess stand seemed lost when we walked in and informed them we had a reservation. Mind you, we arrived early to be safe, but they had a full staff on and several open tables, but refused to seat us early or another couple thay also arrived early."}
{"text":"I was meeting a customer for dinner one night and she chose Bravo... so what could I do?  Say no.  Unfortunately not.    My experience was an interesting one here to say the least.  I have to say considering that I got there around 5pm, I was shocked at how many ladies were already at the bar quite intoxicated.  I had just got off work and did not want to go home since I was meeting the customer around 5:45 so I figured I would grab a glass of wine and wait.    Well, this wait certainly turned out to be me being entertained by this group of three drunk women who the bartender said had been sitting their boozing it up since 3pm.  Apparently with each drink, their desire to one up one another became more and more apparent to those of us sitting there.  I feel bad for these women... to feel the need to talk so loudly about how much money they are spending on an outfit, how they won't buy anything but certain brands... it was laughable and pathetic and disturbing that that is what their lives were about.  Flirting with the bartender, they also made inappropriate comments (he had one of those finger cup things since he got cut and did not want it exposed) which I have to say made me want to get a table ASAP.  I was not going to subject my customer to them with their comments.  I am pretty laid back but it was just downright inappropriate.  I had had enough at this point.  Paid for my wine and was taken to a table to wait.   I will say my server was great, the eggplant parm was yummy and the bread was good.  It was everything that I was subject to prior that was what ruined everything.  Someone should have cut the women off or asked them to tone it down (it was not my place to).  I am just glad that I did not have to subject my customer to it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Nice looking place.   Our waitress was pleasant, attentive and very neat in appearance.  We had Caesar salad, wedding soup, and a grilled chicken salad.  All very good.  Overall a nice experience.  We will certainly be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Great food,, took our son and his soul mate to dinner, his choice, his favorite place,, first the reservation were nice and easy to make. They also let us bring our home made wine,, the service is one of the best, The food is awesome, we have been here many times. This is truly a  restaurant."}
{"text":"I planned a graduation event for my daughter at Bravo.  Living out of town, I worked closely with the manager, Shawn, who, in my opinion, bent over backwards to accommodate my large family in their banquet room.  My relatives raved about the continental breakfast. (By the way, they eat at Bravo often!) The servers were very nice and easy to work with.  If I were planning an evening out or another happy event, Bravo would be the first call I make! Thank you, Bravo!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night. Overall, the food was pretty good. The service was okay.  My biggest complaint is from when we paid our check; we had a Visa gift card so we asked them to use that first and then use a regular credit card for the remaining balance. A few minutes later, the waitress came back with the manager who explained that because of something about the system they use, they only charged $27 of the bill to the gift card, and \"had\" to use the remaining $9 card balance for the waitress' tip. Then they charged the rest to the credit card. The manager said he \"wanted to be up front\" about that and let us know that the waitress had already received a tip...so essentially, the manager tipped the waitress $9 instead of letting us choose what to leave. In the future, I would suggest being \"up front\" about that BEFORE you do it. Give your customer the courtesy of knowing that they're not going to have the option of how much tip to leave before you charge the card. It's not so much the $9 that I'm disappointed about, it's the fact that we weren't given the choice to leave it. Just seemed kind of sneaky that they were \"upfront\" about it, after they already did it."}
{"text":"Average food with terrible service...wilted onjons, old brown limes, warm food rather than hot...a server more interested in talking with her friends (other servers) than taking our order...refilling our drinks...and yet we  were still surprised when we asked about desserts and she said nothing but flopped down a list and disappeared again...i will likely never visit a Bravo again.. 50 dollars for two...what a waste of money"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times a few years ago, but I haven't been back until now. Every time I've come, it's always packed! And the service is great.   FOOD: We started with the complimentary bread and oil with tomatoes. The warm bread is delicious with the oil that's a bit salty but flavorful. I had the grilled salmon salad which is grilled salmon on top of a field of greens, grilled asparagus, tomatoes and shoestring potatoes. The balsamic vinaigrette is a bit sweet but tasty! The whole meal was satisfying for a light dinner."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! We visited the restaurant on Valentine's day and for it to be busy and customer service was still great! We ordered an amazing wine in which I downloaded an app and learned about 18 crimes. How cool!"}
{"text":"Tried bravo for lunch today. Our server was great, very attentive and came by often to check on us throughout the meal. Started off with the onion balsamic and Gorgonzola flatbread which was really tasty. Ordered a double portion of the chicken Marsala and the grilled Mediterranean veggie salad and shared. The chicken was grilled perfectly, but the Marsala sauce was way over reduced and super salty. I had to scrape most of it off of my plate. The \"crispy\" potatoes were disgusting, they looked like they would have been delcious when they were first cooked, but after being deep fried again and given to me, they were glistening with oil and most of them were burned. The grilled veggie salad was nothing special, most of the veggies were grilled nicely except the red peppers, there was just a huge pile of them in the middle of the plate and weren't very edible. I'll probably give bravo another try for dinner solely based on the service."}
{"text":"I attended a bridal shower at this location.  The inside is beautiful and the designs are great.  I loved the color contrast with the sculptures.  The food was okay for my tastes.  Based on what we had I was not impressed to the point I would return.  Like a previous post I would go to Firebirds first."}
{"text":"I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday and seriously had one of the worst meals of my life. I mean it's Bravo's so I guess what should I expect? But, let's begin: We were sat in a corner, waited 10 minutes ( I timed it) before our server even greeted us, then placed our order (they were out of what I wanted of course.) She brought us some bread and dipping sauce, which was the only good thing we had, and our drinks. We got our salads and she walked away, we had no silverware which was really cool.  After I had to find her to ask for it, we proceeded to eat the salad which has no dressing. Our sever, of course, was nowhere to be found so we flagged down another one who then had to \"ring in\" dressing. I mean seriously??! You couldn't just go and get a cup of dressing?!?! So we wait a few minutes for dressing... And then I had the entire core of the lettuce in my salad, a salad which was disgusting.  On to the \"amazing\" entrees, my mom's lasagna was burnt to a crisp and my \"grilled\" chicken pesto spaghettini was water logged and tasted like bland nothingness.   I'm now out of a drink and our server is still missing. When she finally makes an appearance, she sees my empty glass and asks me if I want more. (Sever 101: you don't ask, you just bring a fresh one or the pitcher. I know, I worked in a restaurant.) That took a good 5 minutes and she brings back a pitcher that had maybe 3-4 small sips of water in it. She finally asks how the food was and I said fine because I didn't even want to deal with it, but my mom said something. So the manager comes over.... It was seriously a fiasco. I will never ever go back. All in all the food sucked, the service was worse, and top it off their mints tasted like citrus mint bubblegum flavored chocolate. FOUL is an understatement. And now I'm just #HANGRY"}
{"text":"My favorite place! Good is always excellent. Try the crispy shrimp Napoli and the fettuccine bolognese! Great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Really like the light menu.  Service was quick if you wanted, slow if you wanted.  Prices can be more than some places but quality of food is first rate.  More than just your typical pasta and pizza Italian food.  Nice selection of salads and steak as well.  Good service.  Nice ambiance.  Will try it again, maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"I  went back to Bravo yesterday and my and my mother's dish was very good. We both chose a pasta dish and it was plenty of food compared to the last time I was here. Not only that, but we received excellent service from our server. She was quite friendly also. Even the manager came by to make sure everything was fine. Finally, we never had to look for our server because she was so attentive. I will definitely recommend this restaurant. I wish that I  could rate it again because it's 5 star."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my niece Food was very good and service was also good One issue my niece ordered a salmon dish that had asparagus with it the asparagus that she had were burnt and they turned him over so you couldn't see the Burnt side However the manager came over to our table and asked how everything was and we showed her the burnt she brought the chef over and he offered a new plate but my niece just wanted new asparagus and that is what she received  A mistake corrected in a very professional way Will go back"}
{"text":"Had a party of 13 for a birthday party. Wouldn't have been my first choice for a meal. Don't care for chains, but I wasn't the birthday girl. Peach sangria and rosa were both great. Rosa was my favorite. Bread and dipping sauce was ok. Nothing great. Wish I would have skipped to save the calories. Wedding soup was one of the best I have had. Calamari had no taste and was another thing I wish I could have skipped to save the calories. Service from both waiters was attentive but the table wasn't being bussed in a timely matter. The eggplant parm was bland and mediocre. One member of our party sent their food back. The service from waitstaff at the end of the evening slowed for refills of cocktails that took forever at the bar. The evening could have definitely been improved."}
{"text":"I just celebrated my dads surprise retirement there on Sunday evening. 33 people attended. In the enclosed party room. It was an amazing experience. All of our needs were met. No clean up for me afterwards. I just sat back and enjoyed the event. The aesthetics were pleasing. The food was amazing! Everyone thought it was elegant and had a great private time! I love how you can close the doors to make it a private experience. Our two waiters were very diligent and accommodating. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night after a movie at AMC! We tried 2 pastas: Pasta BRAVO and Pasta Woozie. They were not extraordinary and were pricy (about 15$) each. Would not go back there again anytime soon, felt the service was quite slow and laid back too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a chain. Love the romantic Roman aesthetic combined with under the Tuscan Sun.   Outdoor dining as well as indoor options. Good people watching.   Again, for a chain the strip steak was phenomenal. Cooked to medium rare perfection.  The bf loved it and raved how good it was as consistency is key. So he orders it every time he eats here. Good job to the kitchen for this!!  I'm more a light health conscious eater these days, so sticking with a caprese salad and sautéed Calamari was my fancy.  Now, sautéed Calamari is not easy if your kitchen doesn't make it alot, so it was a bit tough to eat. But - kept my complaints to a minimum as it was still edible.   No time for desert thus trip, as we had a movie to catch, but, will of course be back again!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how good Bravo is for their Happy hour.  Not only do they have 5 dollar drink specials but they have 4 dollar happy hour plates which are DELICIOUS and quite large for portion size.  My favorites were the fried shrimp with a really great sauce with green onions on top, Diablo shrimp, which was a really tasty dipping dish with shrimp  in the sauce and fried eggplant as a dipper, and the chicken bacon and shrimp flatbread.  A great date idea that lets you try a lot of different foods and enjoy good company.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was absolutely wonderful.  He answered all my questions easily and had fun at his job.  Place is pretty crowded so   scope out the bar to get a seat.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Linguine with clam sauce is one of my favorite Italian dishes. The version I got last night at Bravo in Robinson Center was, hands-down, the best ever! There were lots of baby clams that were as tender as could be, and the sauce was buttery perfection. I love Clams Casino, but I've never had bacon in a clam sauce before this. Now I won't have it any other way! The chicken caprese that my wife ordered tasted as delicious as it looked. I promised I would make her this at home as soon as good tomato season arrives. Our service was great, from the reception staff who held the door before my wife could open it for my wheelchair, to our server, Danielle, who was efficient, personable, and helpful. The only part of our experience that kept this night from its fifth star was a disappointing lobster bisque that was too thick, garnished with shrimp instead of lobster bits, and tasted of commercial Lobster base instead of lobster stock and cream. The bread was also a letdown, reminding me of the doughy stuff I'd get at Olive Garden. All that being said, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"An awful experience with mediocre food, orders not accurately prepared and terrible, neglectful service.  The manager( with an attitude) comped our meals, but all we wanted was decent food, served decently.  The waiter disappeared after taking our orders and the food was brought by others who didn't realize the changed made.  The server was too lazy to serve the meal properly and handed it to one in our party across the table and over another guest-a violation of service 101! No one asked if our food was acceptable or if we wanted more water. Bravo has seen us for the last time.  There are many other places with better food and service.bb"}
{"text":"We decided to eat our last cheat meal here.  We wanted to be safe with some place that has been consistently good. The lasagna bolognese and pasta woozy. Both were very good.  Good bye to cheating for 2016!"}
{"text":"Stood in like for 25 minutes just to be told the wait would be at least two hours without reservations. There were numerous empty tables and the staff was very unprofessional. The host would walk about for 10 minutes at a time and stand in the back just talking to other workers. Very pissed and will never be returning."}
{"text":"We attended a birthday party dinner a while ago and enjoyed the food  So we decided to try lunch here. We were greeted by a friendly waitress who brought bread and olive oil to the table . The lunch menu had a selection of appetizers, salads soups, chicken , pasta, seafood entries , pizza, sandwiches,  traditional favorites such as eggplant parmesan, chicken parmesan, chicken marsala,  steaks from the grill, and desserts such as tiramisu, mascarpone cheesecake, and seasonal sweets, plus  wines and liquor too. A brunch menu: crepes and omelettes served till 3 pm on weekends,  The restaurant was clean and neat with a comfortable setting. Menu ,a bit pricey. We enjoyed the bread with sun dried tomato and herb infused olive oil. I had the lobster bisque, a tad bit peppery for my taste but still tasty and enjoyable. I also ordered the Romano crusted chicken salad with parmesan dressing. The chicken was delicious and tender, 2 white meat breaded  patties over a large portion of greens. The dressing delicious. My dining mate ordered the grilled  chicken marsala which came with grilled green beans  and mashed potatoes. He enjoyed it. I sampled his and thought the potatoes were a bit salty . Food came out hot, good portions and plated nicely. We would return again."}
{"text":"My good friend and I dropped in for lunch today. It was empty because of the terrible snow storm and we had the Roasted Chicken Harvest Salad. It was very good. We had good service and the whole place smelled amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Bravo a lot, in several locations. Food's reliably good, never had any complaints about the service. On my last visit to this location I was going to get a modest wine on their wine list that I'm quite familiar with because I have it at home: Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. Pretty decent wine, not too expensive, about $10/bottle retail. Unless you buy a bottle at Bravo - then it's almost FIVE TIMES that much.  I get that one is paying for the luxury of having wine served while dinner is cooked for you. The traditional markup was double retail, then it crept up to triple, and now Bravo sees fit to try and bilk their customers with a quintuple markup.  Capitalism? Maybe. But it's also a management attitude, one at Bravo which has apparently decided that rather than a reasonable markup, they're testing to see exactly how much they can gouge the customer and get away with it. There's a line somewhere, and for me, five times is that line. There are a gazillion restaurants looking for my dining dollars - I'd rather go somewhere that appreciates my business as clearly Bravo does not. What's next? Six times? Why not just charge an even $100? Ridiculous? So is almost $50 for a bottle that wholesales around $8-9.  Update: Following my review Bravo Customer Service requested contact info so that the \"guest services team\" could follow-up but they never did, which simply confirms my comments regarding customer appreciation."}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte near this location.  I woul dgo there about 3 times a month - sometimes more, sometimes less.  THey never delivered a bad meal, the service was always pretty good.  It isn't too pricey but it isn't inexpensive.  I love the Pasta Bravo and their chicken and spinach flatbread is awesome.   If you are going to the Northlake Mall - plan on eating here!"}
{"text":"This location has had a lot of design and structural changes inside. The sitting has been rearranged for the better and so has the service.  My niece got some dish with mashed potatoes and they were *natural* potatoes! Everyone's food had the right amount of salt. I had a good time with my family. Lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker who is used to eating great Italian food, this food was OK. Wait staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Overall it was ok. The banana stuffed flat bread was very good but everyone's meals were just average. And for the price I would expect alot better quality and quantity.  Service was great but we won't be back it was just plain and so many Bette places around Charlotte to go."}
{"text":"A Nice Experience :)  PROS: Great service Meal was really good (I ordered Salmon which was surprisingly fresh!) and very tasty! Reasonably Priced  CONS: Parking (large parking area which a gazillion retailers and establishments share.  Problematic at times) Chain/Corporate establishment"}
{"text":"5 star from me today. The food and service were both outstanding. I highly recommend the shrimp brushetta. Excellent"}
{"text":"I am fan of Bravos at the waterfront. They have a consistent great menu, lots of options to eat healthy and prices are fair. We have this restaurant always as our favorite place to go when we are in the waterfront. Excellent for group gathering as it is not too loud. The only thing I always say is why don't they get the waiters a better coaching where they are not asking and interrupting all the time to ask \"  guys is all good?\", the great service of a great fine restaurant is hard to find these days. But this is the only thing I have to complain a bit about Bravo's. Always a good place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything- dinner, drinks, dessert and service. The place is nicely decorated, ample and clean. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decent Italian chain. We got the salmon salad, lobster ravioli alla vodka, and the lobster bisque appetizer. Nothing really stood out. But, nothing was bad, either. Lobster bisque had little lobster in it. The bread and olive oil was OK.   The interior of the restaurant was decent. High ceilings and a lot of seats.   We went in at 9pm and were out by 10:10pm to catch our 10pm movie. The service was slow at the end (we waited for our credit cards to be taken for 10 minutes), although we had notified our waitress early on.   Tastes like a chain, looks like a chain, acts like a chain, so it must be a chain. We were not disappointed, but were not thrilled either."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice over two month period. The food/service was so bad the manager bought our entire meal both times. Half the meal showing up. Entrees completely incorrect. The Marsala sauce on the chicken was canned gravy with some mushrooms in it. Gross. My wife ordered a seafood dish that was delivered WITHOUT THE SEAFOOD! The manager brought the most pathetic looking, beat up fish/shrimp on this undersized plate and suggested my wife scrape them unto her entree plate to compete her dish! It's not exactly cheap here either. This place is broken and needs some serious management changes."}
{"text":"The lobster ravioli was good. But the bravo pasta wasn't bravo at all. It just like the pasta you can buy in pizza hut. I prefer the ravioli."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal! The taste was great. The portion was enough for me to have it for dinner the next night. My waitress, Mandy, was very attentive but not annoying. She even made suggestions on meals that we might find very appealing. She had a great sense of humor and she kept our glasses full. She should be promoted or something!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant like all Bravo's. Great food, good assortment,  reasonable prices, excellent service;  overall, very good management."}
{"text":"The service was top notch. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was fantastic. We got peach tea, lobster bisque, one of the eggs Benedict options for brunch, a pasta dish, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was fresh and incredible.  I love the decor - tables are nice; outdoor seating; beautiful ambiance.   I can honestly say I had the best tiramisu of my life. I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Bravo before, so I didn't have much to compare it to.  I went for a late lunch with my family after spending the morning in the mall.  Service was very quick and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed.  We ordered a pizza for an appetizer, and I got the grilled salmon for my main course.  It was very good- the Sause was great and the vegetables were well prepared-, but it was not as much food as I was expecting.  Don't get this dish if you are famished because it will not be substantial enough to satiate your hunger.  I would recommend one of the larger pasta dishes if you are hungry, but the salmon is great if you are looking for something light and healthy."}
{"text":"My friend has heard great things about Bravo's brunch on Saturdays and Sundays and asked if we should give it a shot. I was reluctant because I regularly avoid Bravo at all costs due to previous visits taking hours out of my day for an 'okay' meal, but I was getting bored with the variety at the Waterfront, which my friend and I frequent regularly for our catch-up lunches every few weeks. I gave a half-hearted yes and decided to give them another try- we decided on 11AM as soon as they opened (that's a little late for brunch, no?) and were promptly seated. We had a movie across the street at Loews at 12:35 so of course this was more than enough time to eat brunch - not! We didn't get out of there until 12:15 and not because we were sitting and chatting after the meal, but the long wait for the food! More on that later...  The brunch menu has a decent selection of breakfast foods, a couple sandwiches, a couple types of pizza, a few entree salads, and quite a few pasta options. I decided on the Romano chicken salad but asked for grilled chicken instead of the breaded/fried chicken. It was delicious with chopped lettuce, chopped eggs, small pieces of bacon, Parmesan cheese (quite odd- you'd think they'd have Parmesan shavings or shredded Parmesan, but no, it's like the finely-ground Kraft Parmesan cheese from the shaker bottle); the Parmesan dressing was excellent, though I wish they tossed the dressing with the salad instead of giving cups of the dressing as it was quite thick. My friend decided on the egg white omelette that comes with a side of fruit salad. She really enjoyed hers as well.   Back to the wait time-  I haven't dined at Bravo for years even though I live in close proximity to two locations (Galleria and Waterfront). IT IS SOOOO SLOW HERE. I just don't get it! As I mentioned, we got there at 11:00 on the dot, so there weren't many other people dining around us, and our food took 45 minutes, for an omelette and an entree salad! I think that is just crazy. To be fair,  I would expect that for hearty pasta dinners if the place is completely packed and it's dinner time, but not a mostly-empty restaurant at 11:00 in the morning! It is extremely annoying. I see that nothing has changed in the service department so I am still reluctant to go again.   Maybe we'll meet again in a few more years, Bravo. And mostly for the bread and oil :)"}
{"text":"I was expecting an \"Italian\" Applebee's but was pleasantly surprised and delighted by my experience here.  If you've read my Applebee's review you'll know that I can't stand that place.  We went here for my father's b'day dinner celebration and I ordered the chianti braised beef ravioli.  It was very good and the portions were big enough that I had plenty of left overs for another full meal.    We shared the chocolate cake desert which was delish!  Prices are extremely reasonable and the wine selection is decent.      We went on a Thursday and I was surprised that there was a wait for a table since this place is huge and it was sorta in the middle of the week.  But we didn't wait for too long - probably 15 minutes before our buzzer went off."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner at this place.  Arrived at around 7:00.  There was no wait time and nobody waiting to be seated.  However, when I entered with my wife and son, the hostess indicated that the wait would be 25 minutes!  I was shocked because there were booths available!  Right after the hostess told me about the wait time we sat down In a small waiting area.  Immediately a young couple enter the restaurant and the hostess asked them \"a party for 2\" in which they answered yes.  The hostess sat them down in one of the vacant booth!  I was dumbfounded!  I asked the hostess, did they have reservations?  She said no.  She than said, your table will be in a few minutes.  Hey, the restaurant was not full.  I don't want to think that since we were talking in Spanish when we entered restaurant we were not provided a table.  Nevertheless, we decided to leave the place and take our business somewhere else.  Said to say say that things like this would occur.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"My mother and I went a few days ago. We split two different lunch specials, had the shrimp appetizer, had two iced teas. Our server Moshawn  (I hope I spelled your name right) was fantastic paying attention to us making sure our food was on time and drinks were always filled to get in and out in an hour to get to our other plans. It was a very lovely quick lunch and we would definitely do it again some other time when we go back to the mall and maybe have more time to explore dessert! :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bravo several times and while it was never the greatest food, it was acceptable. Yesterday I ate there with six other people and ordered the fried cod sandwich. I was not expecting the fish to be hanging off the plate like other notable restaurants, nor did not anticipate being served a barely two ounce piece of cod.  This is disgraceful.  I could have gotten a bigger fish sandwich at McDonalds for a quarter of the price.  Take it off the menu if you can't serve a larger portion than that. Otherwise you are just insulting your customers. I did not want to make a scene in front of the others or I would have sent it back.  Do not order this sandwich."}
{"text":"Been to a number of Bravo! locations. What I like is the consistently good food. Never outstanding, but quality, portion size and flavors you can count on from location to location. This one is the same. I had the lasagna. As expected, I took half home and had another dinner. It's delicious. Bravo! recently changed their menu and raised the prices so be aware if you have not been here recently. I like Bravo! but go less often since they raised prices. :-("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my 2.5 month old on a Friday because I had a taste for some pasta, plus I had a rewards card coupon. It wasn't crowded at 1:30. Because I had a stroller, I opted to sit in the bar area. It took 5 min. for someone to come over to see what I wanted to drink. Since, it took so long for drinks, I went ahead and ordered when she came over. Food came out fairly quickly and was tasty. However, I only had water and I only got a refill when it was time to bring me my check.   I thought the bartender/waitress was strictly for the bar area and it would be fast service, but I was wrong.   Also, they have a good happy hour, so that would be the only reason I would go back."}
{"text":"Bravo glad I am not going anymore. Our party, the foud of us order lamb chops. It took  too long to get it. Once we got them they were over cooked.  The manager came over and said sorry. That's it. No free dessert or anything else.  Poor business people."}
{"text":"Came here before a movie on a Tuesday night.  They had the bar bites special going on for 2.95.  The items looked quite tasty, so my partner and I thought we'd give it a try.    I got the Roma Tomato Flatbread and the Artichoke and Spinach dip.  Both were quite tasty.  The Flatbread however came out at room temperature, but the flavor was excellent, so I did not bother sending it back.  The spinach and artichoke dip served with gourmet parmesan encrusted crackers was extremely good and I would order it again.  I had not been to this place in about 5 years, and was glad I made the return.  Definitely will be stopping back next time I'm at the waterfront for a movie."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in North Lake Mall.  Service was good and the food was decent.  I would say this place is comparable to a Carrabbas Italian Grill.    I went to Bravos as part of a group for a year end appreciation dinner.  Someone else picked up the tab so I can't complain too much.  I don't know that any of the food was memorable enough to bring me back, unless of course the meal is free again.  That said, the food was decent, but there are better options."}
{"text":"We will never dine at this restaurant again. Horrible service from the moment we walked in (we had reservations) the Hostess station was too busy chatting amongst themselves to even grace us with their acknowledgement. Finally I asked to be checked in for my reservation, the gal looked as if my question was an inconvenience. Once seated, our waiter comes by and takes our drink orders. Clearly Esteban, was having a rough night as our table was located near the computer where the servers enter in our food orders, we heard him and other servers complaining about their jobs. Our appetizers came, our drinks empty and still no Esteban to be seen. Another server delivered our mains and our table cluttered from emptied plates and beverage-less glasses , he continued to try to put the mains on the table with the clutter! How about you clear the table first ?? I ordered the Bravo Pasta, it was horrible!! Tasteless... a little seasoning would have helped. Esteban finally reappeared, asked if we needed anything else, my reply? Our check please."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for some dessert between sushi for dinner and NYE at the Velvet Tango Room.  We avoided better places because we figured it would be tough to get in.  We should have avoided dessert altogether.  I try to skip national chains when possible, but it's not always possible.  I got the cheesecake and a caffe toscano, and my wife got the chocolate chip bread pudding and a bellini.    The cheesecake was what I would call \"cheesecake brulee\" and I'm sorry... cheesecake doesn't need to be screwed with.  If you're an executive chef that thinks you know better than generations of New Yorkers, at least give your patrons the option of a plain jane cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself sucked, even after I chipped all the caramelized sugar off.  It was like it was made with low-fat ingredients, which you just can't do.  Bad crust, too.      The bread pudding was pretty good.  My caffe toscano (coffee, rum, bourbon, and something else) would've been good had it been made with coffee that wasn't weak.  My wife's bellini was frozen and blended.  Excuse me?  It is a well decorated place with a great atmosphere, and I'm sure they have some really good signature dishes, but last night I was reminded of why I like to avoid these types of places."}
{"text":"Just an update...I received a message from Bravo regarding my recent experience. They asked that I send them my email address. To my surprise, they sent me a $20 e-gift certificate! I thought that was a nice gesture...I'll be sure to use it : )"}
{"text":"Soooo I just had lunch here, and the food was pretty gross.  Disappointed all around because I usually love eating at Bravo.  The one in Cranberry is always on point, but I definitely won't be coming back to this location.   Man, I don't even know where to start. Let's go with service.  Everything took soooo long.  It took our waiter 20 minutes to bring us stale bread that was clearly old.  I couldn't even cut through it with a knife. The waiter apologized and all, but the \"fresh\" bread wasn't that much better.  Then, my mom and I waited another 20 minutes for entrees which were salty and greasy.   We ordered the Chicken Milenese and Pepperoni & Meatball Manicotti.  The manicotti was ridiculously greasy - drowning in oil, ugh.  On top of it all, the filling was mad mushy.  My mom's chicken was straight up gross.  The oil had this nasty smell to it - I don't really know how to describe it.  They probably used old oil that's been sitting there, double ugh.  Plus, the chicken tasted super gamey.  The only thing edible on her dish was the herb linguine which was mediocre at best.    Bah, super disappointed.  If you're in the mood for Italian, I suggest driving the extra distance and goin' to the Cranberry location."}
{"text":"I really like this place and eat hear every time I'm in town which is about twice a month. I tried something new this time and ordered my favorite salad only this time \"to go\". I have to be honest I was really disappointed in my salad. It's possible it was just a to go issues. But both the size portion of the salad in the ingredients that were included in the salad seem to be significantly less than when I order it at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed an Easter lunch here on Sunday 16 April 2017. There were specials for Easter as well as the regular menu items.  I had the special Easter frittata which was stuffed with Boursin cheese and served with a chopped salad. My hubby had a glazed pork chop, that was fall off the bone tender, with whipped potatoes and French green beans. This was accompanied by their herbed bread and dipping oil. Every bite was delicious.  We love their Bellinis with peach nectar that are served  slightly frozen. It was busy, but we had an attentive server. We like the ambience, open kitchen, brick pizza oven, and outdoor seating. It's never too loud here. Some restaurants are so loud that you can't enjoy a conversation at your table. Not a problem here.  I definitely recommend Bravo's. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant.  I was extremely disappointed to discover that the \"Penne Mediterranean\" was removed from the menu.  After talking with one of the employees (a delightful, lovely woman - extremely knowledgeable and helpful), I learned that this very popular dish was removed because the restaurant was no longer using penne pasta or sun-dried tomatoes.  This is so confusing -- why would you eliminate an entire pasta and don't you use sun-dried tomatoes in other dishes?  Oh well, I suppose I will have to find another dish that I love as equally as I loved this one.  It always surprises me when a popular item is removed from the menu...  I hope there are enough posts requesting this dish to come back on the menu -- sun-dried tomatoes are not that expensive and no idea why there is an issue with penne pasta.  Maybe this dish can be made with bite size rigatoni, bow-ties, or even cavatelli."}
{"text":"New management team seems to have given this a new life.  Staff is friendlier than it used to be. Food is markedly improved. Good work."}
{"text":"I went to Bravo this evening with some clients. They are local and this is one of their favorite places to go. This is my second time at the restaurant and probably my last. The hostesses were casual, but attentive and we were seated at a comfortable booth... The menu looked great and diverse, with lots of yummy sounding Italian appetizers & dinners. Our waiter was busy & we felt very rushed throughout the entire dinner. Having been a waiter... I can tell you this guy needed a lot more training. He didn't welcome us to the restaurant, didn't give his name, didn't ask us how we were, didn't tell us what the specials were etc. No he he took our drink order and disappeared. When he returned we gave him our dinner orders, but he never asked whether we wanted an appetizer, salad, soup & literally left the table so quickly we couldn't tell him. When he came back with our drinks, we asked to place an appetizer order. He returned with my salad but forgot my clients soup... What a dope! I had no sooner put the dressing on my salad, and the entrées were at our table? Terrible timing! To add insult to injury, my entree was some of the lowest quality Italian food that I've eaten (they couldn't even get the temperature right - my chicken was cold). My client had to ask another waiter to bring her a salad, because our waiter didn't come back to check on us. When the waiter finally did return to the table he was in a rush to clear it & I was appalled how he reached over us to clear the plates. I left the waiter a 10% tip which was way more than he deserved. Once he picked up the check he never came back...terrible service! As we left the restaurant the hostesses said See ya? Really? Not I hope you have a pleasant evening. Had I not been with clients I would've 100% demanded a different waiter and to see the manager."}
{"text":"Omgosh!!! Deliciousness at its finest!!! Wonderful customer service, delicious bread, and the perfect lighting for a dinner date or time with family. I had a pasta dish because I heart pasta. Let me just say, it was to live for!!!"}
{"text":"Bravo is pretty much the Italian version of the Cheesecake Factory.  Their interiors are so similar I wondered if the two were related, but they don't seem to be.  That being said, I had some of the best eggplant parmesan I have ever had here last night and I am a big fan of eggplant.  It was even good leftover for lunch today."}
{"text":"If I dine here 10 times, nine of those times I order pasta bravo. It's all good. Most often I get it to go which can be an adventure. The to go area is sometimes manned by 1 person, the hostess stand usually has 4 young ladies waiting to take names and lead guests to their respective table, the problem is when things are slow at the hostess desk THE hostesses should keep an eye on the to go stand but they never do, maybe they resent the fact they are upper st Clair or Leno people and hate the idea of actually waiting on someone but this continues to be a weak spot, the bread is boring too, they used to serve 2 types but they abandoned the better of the 2 types."}
{"text":"Carol and I love this place, our favorite patio restaurant in Charlotte.  This is a great place to get some awesome Italian food but also nice to get a lite flatbread and drink and enjoy the afternoon."}
{"text":"Italian food is one of my great weaknesses. Your garlic better be fresh and your Parmesan better not be a powder. Bravo definitely does not suffer from these problems. The food is very good. Portions are a little bit on the lite side. They are a little more fancy, but I am taken back to my Italian neighbor growing up who would cook twice as much food as  needed. You left stuffed and with lunch for the next two days. Bravo didn't fill me up like my old neighbor did, but I was still satisfied. Our Waitress was very friendly. I usually stop by Bravo when I am around the area and I will be back again."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with my boss. Therefore I was unable to tell them that they had one of the worst tomato sauces I've ever tasted. It was a creamy Italian tomato sauce. I'm sure they would have remade it but it would not have been appropriate for me to ask. Came with shrimp which was fine."}
{"text":"Always good service and delicious food. I tried salmon pasta which has feta as an ingredient. I wondered how that would work but it was terrific. My husband had pasta woozie. He thought it was a little too much salt on chicken but still gobbled it up."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Better than Olive Garden and service here is very friendly and professional. It would also be a good place for a business lunch. This is the best location on the east side of Cleveland. Only minor negative is parking can be a problem here but they also have a free valet service which is nice. Pasta Fra Diavalo is my favorite from here!"}
{"text":"I love that salads are served ice cold, even a few frozen pieces of lettuce (weird the first few bites but then kinda neat). I thought the Caesar dressing needed a little more oomph but the chicken parm was good and my husband enjoyed the fish. Service was very good. Dessert was yum. Though they are a chain, I think comparisons to Olive Garden are unwarranted, as this place has a nicer atmosphere, better service and far better food."}
{"text":"I'd rather give them FIVE stars but keep getting informed that they are often hidden under \"not acceptable\". We took our doggie over to do some shopping and for the 2nd time stopped there for a drink and some appetizers. This time our server was a lovely, professional gal named Danielle. Forget our first server's name, but equal warmth and professionalism. Great food, beautiful atmosphere, tempting shopping. . .oh yes, we'll be back for sure! :-)) Oh, and my husband chose to mention that he forgot our anniversary and made a mess of things. It was just a passing remark, but it didn't fly by Danielle. When we were done with our food a fabulous trio of desserts showed up - a brownie with ice cream, a perfectly prepared flan & a very interesting dish which I could only describe as perhaps a ricotta ice cream? All delicious, compliments of management. I'd never had expected that, it was only our second time there. What a nice surprise!  P.S. ESPECIALLY FOND OF THE LUNCH MENU & APPETIZERS AVAILABLE AT THAT THAT TIME. There was a luscious Caprese salad & an incredible shrimp dish, both very generous portions. No need to cook dinner that evening!! ;-))"}
{"text":"What a great place.  We took my daughter and a few friends out for lunch and a movie for her birthday on Saturday afternoon.  They have gluten free pasta and my daughter has celiac so this place works perfectly.  We made an online reservation just in case, and it's nice that they allow that since Blakeney is hit or miss on the crowds.  Nice hostesses and wait staff.  Our server was sensitive to my daughters allergy and when told that she wanted gluten free pasta he asked us if that was correct and he informed the staff in the kitchen.  VERY NICE.  I had the Pasta Woozie which, while basic was very good and filling.  Sweetie had a Salmon Salad, and my youngest ordered a cheese pizza off the kids menu.  Most places that do kids pizza's give you something frozen and you just grow used to it.  Not Bravo...they gave her a pretty big hand tossed, fresh pizza that was delicious, for the $6.00 which included a drink that's the best deal going for kids menu's in the area IMO.  Bravo is close to the house, has a great ambiance, and was a great kick off to my daughters birthday party.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I took my kids for their Birthday Dinner.. Not happy at all to be the First time.. The Waitress was really bad very not want to be bother we ask if we could get a birthday Dessert for the kids.. She came and through the plate at the table with no desire... I really think I won't be going back and the food not good at all.. I think Brixx it's better and they just accross them..."}
{"text":"I had a birthday dinner on November 19th with 15 friends. As usual the dinner was excellent but the server made our entire party feel like we were the only customers she had. Bravos should clone her. Our food was excellent and everybody had a great time. Not one single order was mixed up or messed up. Every plate was so clean there was nothing left for the dishwasher to do. Thanks Bravos fir making my birthday dinner special."}
{"text":"They got my husband's order wrong but made up for it, giving him what he actually ordered and letting him keep what they gave him.  I found the food to be underwhelming and overpriced. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the Olive Garden, but that's what it reminded me of - just more expensive and no salad (boo!) - also not as good. Pretty bland.   I guess if you're a suburbanite who wants a \"fancy night out\", and you don't like complex flavor, go for it!   The atmosphere is really nice. Underwhelmed by the staff and service. The server we had was training someone that night - awkward.   Overall, would I go back? Probably not, especially given all of the other options in the area.   Try out some other options in the area!"}
{"text":"While shopping at Robinson a couple weeks ago with my parents, I suggested dinner at Bravo. I hadn't been to a Bravo since my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh, and I really enjoyed coming back to the restaurant. Though the interior of the restaurants are elaborate, I do appreciate how nice they look compared to their competitors (such as Olive Garden). The service was good, and the food was great. I ordered the Penne Mediterranean, which is made with multi-grain pasta, spinach, sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, feta, and olive oil, and it was delicious! My parents ordered the Margherita Pizza. The pizza was tasty, and the crust was perfectly chewy, doughy, and sweet. I look forward to coming back in the future and trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"The two times that I have randomly dined at this Bravo has been on Wednesday evening. Yay for Martini Wednesdays!! It's always a great surprise when they plop that menu on your table. All of Bravo's Martinis are only $5 on Wednesday evenings, and they have several good options.  The food is very dependable. I most recently ordered the Pasta Woozie as my entree. It was just the right portion size - large enough to really fill me up but small enough that I wasn't taking a mound of noodles home as leftovers.  I look forward to dining at this Bravo again and hope that I remember to come back on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Great place. last minute dinner choice ...enjoyed every bit ...definitely coming back ...sorry Carraba's"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner with family on a Tuesday night. The wait staff was attentive and professional. The food was decent Italian fare.  The dining room is a large open area with high ceilings. Very large light fixtures hang from ceiling beams. There is a bar area in one corner opposite the entrance...the kitchen is on one side and a private room on an adjacent side  The table shared the calamari appetizer... nothing special but not aweful. I ordered the Spicy bay scallop marinara entrée. The scallops were tender and delicious, the sauce was a nice spicy tomato sauce but definitely not too spicy. Someone at the table let the staff know it was my birthday so they brought me a vanilla creme brule. They must have just taken it out of the cooler because it was cold in the center. As creme brule goes, I've had better. I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  Overall we had a pleasant dining experience and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I used to really love Bravo, but it has seemed to decline over the years. Not only this location, but as a whole. This particular visit, the server was kind but extremely slow. I had to ask for refills repeatedly, and even silverware. He also did not bring grated cheese for our pasta, so we had to ask for that also. The food wasn't even flavorful. Again, not only this location but Bravo as a whole. Never thought I'd say this, but I prefer Olive Garden over Bravo anyday."}
{"text":"I went with my parents on a Saturday afternoon.  It was not very busy, and there was seemingly a lot of staff.  The hostess was not exactly rude, just pointedly uninterested in being welcoming.  We were seated immediately and given menus, but no water.  We waited for 10 minutes, but no one ever approached our table to take our order or bring water, although a waiter brought lots of dishes to a table next to us and a bill to another.  We gave it another five minutes, as mom had been there before and liked the salad options.  No one ever came over!  We put on our jackets and left.  Unsurprisingly, the hostess didn't even pretend to care. From the decor I had been expecting a generic chain restaurant, but not even Olive Garden would ever treat its guests with such indifference and disregard."}
{"text":"Decent Italian. Not thrilling but OK. I had the lasagna which is a large portion swimming in sauce which was good. Service was good. Just not overly wowed but would go again if necessary."}
{"text":"Based on one visit  Great bread - very impressed for a chain. Service was excellent. Good ice-tea, seems silly but it's hard to get really good ice tea anymore. Very nice salad. Tilapia entrée was interesting, risotto was over-cooked but the fish was done to perfection, just rather plain. It needed something more, was not bad, but would not order again.  To be honest I went in expecting to be highly disappointed: chain + Italian = miserable food, instead I was impressed and plan on trying them again. PS that says something because Italian is not my favorite food."}
{"text":"So I thought it was a good idea to go Bravos for brunch- BIG mistake!!! Our order was pretty simple, just 4 orders of French toast. After about an hour of waiting 2 of 4 orders came out, cold & brunt!! The waitress did apologize but at this point we were hungry & beyond frustrated! We immediately got up & left than went across the street to MiMi's Cafe. Thanks for ruining my Mother's Day brunch for my sister Bravos!!!"}
{"text":"Bleecht. Bad, bad, bad.   The one star that I give is for the dear friends with whom we ate. The sauce was disgusting and watered down. Chef Boyardee is better than the stuff that they try to pass off as \"Italian\". The service was really not great either-- the waitress was super sarcastic to the point of it being laughable, especially because she looked like a homeless person. Between that, and the cheesy plastic pillars and bad rococo art, you could not pay me to go back to this place.   I find it hard to believe that anyone in Pittsburgh would eat at a Bravo, especially because of the mecca of amazing Italian restaurants here. It is a sub-par chain that gives fine cuisine a bad name. Go to Bloomfield instead for a much more authentic experience!"}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE. had the absolute rudest waitress i think in american. she started out by not bringing us drinks for 15 minutes, then when she brought them back, i asked to order and she pointed her finger in my face and told me to wait. after she finally took our order, we never received bread, so i had to ask another server because we were very hungry. after i was already anger with her, she pushed me over the edge when she stood right by the table and pulled her hair up, then carried out my food to me. nasty. cmon people, listen to me, and DONT GO HERE."}
{"text":"If I wanted microwaved Italian food I would've went to my aunt Louisa's house. It was just straight up bad. Horrible service flavorless food and overall poor cleanliness. I felt like I was in a fraternity house about to be beaten with an old boat ore. I paid my bill and tipped a fair amount. But if you're looking for the worst Italian food in the world I think you can find it at bravo at the waterfront."}
{"text":"The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because I could have slapped the hostess. Once again, I was put in the back with the loudest birthday party group possible because why? You guessed it, I had a  baby. This irritates me beyond belief! From now on, I'm going to be a jerk about it.  Anyway, to the important stuff. Despite the issue to the group next to us, the service and food were excellent! Melanie was our server and she did an outstanding job! My glass was never empty, I never had to ask for more drink, she kept the table clear of empty dishes, paid attention to details in our order, and always had a smile on her face. Why can't there be more servers like her??  The overall aesthetics of the place were very nice. It had Doric and ionic pillars for decorations, Italian themed paintings on the wall, and the lighting was just right. Not too bright, not too dim.  My husband and I started off with the calamari. Even though it could have used a little bit more flavor, it was still very good. The horse radish sauce and marinara sauce were excellent choices to go along with the appetizer. Alongside the appetizer, a small loaf of precut bread (I think it had a little bit of rosemary in it) and this dipping sauce that was out of this world. I'm not a tomato fan, but this was great! It was an olive oil base dip that had sun dried tomatoes, oregano, thyme, black pepper, and a few other things in it. I couldn't stop eating it!  Caesar salad came next, I love it when restaurants put your salad on a chilled plate. The salad was very good and not too much as well. They had homemade croutons in the salad that tasted like they had parmesan cheese in it along with other flavors. They also didn't just give you a plate with a few leaves and all stalks. That was very nice.  For our main course, I had the Chicken Scallopini. It was 2 chicken breast fillets lightly sautéed in olive oil topped with feta cheese, portobello mushroom, another kind of cheese, and a lemon, caper butter sauce. It was served with linguini on the side. Minus the too many capers, it was fantastic! I thought my chicken would be dry, but it was very juicy and full of flavor. My husband got the Frutta di Mare. This thing was loaded with mussels and clams on the half shell. From what I saw, the seafood was on top of a bed of fettuccini and marinara sauce. He could not stop raving about it, so I am going to guess he liked his meal.   For dessert, I got crème brulee and my husband got the chocolate chip bread pudding. FINALLY a restaurant that had crème brulee that isn't a 5 star restaurant. Nobody serves it anymore. Of course, I loved every minute of it, and so did my daughter. I think she ended up eating half of it! My husband was in love with his bread pudding. I'd never had a bread pudding with chocolate chips in it. It was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with my in-laws from out of town for dinner and we had a reservation for 6 at 7pm.  We arrived at 6:45 and were told that are table want ready because they were waiting for a large party to leave.  We waited until 7:15 before I pointed out that there was a table large enough to seat us in the corner that had been unoccupied for 20 plus minutes.  I was told that the table was for a reservation coming in at 7:30pm...hmmmmmm.  I asked the hostess why we were supposed to wait for our table still when they were holding this table for a future reservation when we had been there for over 45 minutes?!  She told me \"that's just how we do it and your table just left so you'll be seated in a area minutes.\"  Huh?!  After we sat down I asked to speak to a manager because I felt like the way the hostess explained the situation could have been better.  The GM, Jennifer, came over and I explained (in a very calm way) what had happened and I thought it was a good learning experience for a young, high school aged hostess on how to explain seating priorities.  She agreed 100% and thanked me for not be rude about the way it was handled.  She also said we could get some appetizers on the house for the inconvenience and brought out a few different items for us to try!  WOW!!!  Overall...Jennifer was fantastic as was the service and I would go to this restaurant time and time again!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times I ordered off the gluten free menu. Dinner I had the 5 oz filet mignon with steamed veggies and sweet potato mash. Delish... Veggies were done to perfection and not mushy. The steak was melt in your mouth good. While the sweet potatoes were very good, they put too much on the plate. For lunch I had the chicken and pasta dish. This was also very good. It is nice to have a restaurant close by that serves very tasty gluten free meals."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food in town--but I literally drive in from over 30-miles away for the service! The staff and management here are so nice and responsive!! The manager, Alex, made some amazing dessert recommendations!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food similar to most Bravo. Slightly negative review as I felt like we were tucked in a tiny table like you would expect in Manhattan yet the restaurant is huge.  Family of 4 at a table for 2."}
{"text":"Very average Italian food.   We have another Bravo in Evanston and that one is better in terms of options (I remember them having a seafood pasta that I couldn't find at this location).   I like the bread they give out at the beginning - bread itself is warm and soft. My pasta was mediocre. Nothing special and I could probably make it myself at home."}
{"text":"Chain food is chain food, but Bravo does chain food pretty well. My fiancé and I went to dinner last evening and had the most stellar service with Leigh as our waitress. She was attentive, relaxed, and just plain kind. She recommended the Sangria Rosa, which was delicious, and kept up with my fiancé's ability to suck down iced tea at an alarming rate. All in all, it was a great evening and a great meal. We will be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant.  I have been to it in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.  Food is decent.   Had a bad experience at this location on Thursday night, due to service issues in the kitchen.  A  table of 10 near us complained too. My chicken Parmesan was very cold.  Also it took a long time initially to get our drinks.  My son's pasta Bravo was excellent.  The manager did a great job of handling the situation.   He was willing to replace my dinner, but that would have taken too long.  He warmed it up; took it off our tab and gave us each a desert on the house.  He also stopped by to make sure everything was fine.    I also use the free appetizer coupon by signing up on their site."}
{"text":"Decent Calamari, Caesar salad and Chicken Pamigana.  Tomato sauce was not as tasty as I would have liked.  Went late on a Tuesday not very crowded.  Waiter was a little annoying; came by too much.  They have bar bite specials after 9PM."}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, I really like this place. When I visit Cleveland, I like to eat here. They have a really rich and tasty Chicken Milanese pasta dish that I always get. Their salads are quite nice too. The atmosphere and waiters are always upbeat and positive here."}
{"text":"This review is late.  We ate here on 2 Jan for my sisters birthday, we did not have reservations, we arrived around 730p. We did have a bit of a wait but it was understandable seeing as it was 7 of us with no reservation.The GM (John I believe) was AWESOME!!!! He assisted the staff in turning over a table from a party that had been their for sometime prior to us.  The food was amazing, the staff was amazing. I have no complaints and will be back."}
{"text":"In February while out of state I worked with Scott Kelly to plan a 70th Birthday Party for my mom. Scott helped with everything from menu selection, menu printout, the private room layout, to table settings! The staff was wonderful and super helpful!  The food was superb and everyone had a great time! I highly recommend this place for your dining party needs!"}
{"text":"Chains chain chains... I don't prefer them but I keep ending up at them! I do like the bread and oil they serve. This place is a little much for my taste. Very cheesy decor that looks like ancient Greece or something. Solid orders include pasta fra diavolo, lobster bisque, spicy scallop marinara, and Mediterranean vegetable salad"}
{"text":"Not thrilled. Someone had said Bravo is part of the same restaurant group as Brio in Piedmont Row, Southpark. While price point was about the same, there was no comparison. Bravo is the Foodlion, while Brio is the Wholefoods. Meal was nothing special. Chicken on the dry side, salad soggy. Service was friendly, but I felt hurried to place an order. Meal came out quick and hot. But there are better choices in the Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Bravo is a chain Italian restaurant run out of Columbus, Ohio.  Not a promising start for a review, no?  Well, they must do things differently in Columbus, because the food is outstanding and reasonable priced ($10-$22 per entree).  I found the Chicken Milanase to be outstanding, even if I don't know how to spell it.  The Mixed Grill of beef and chicken was also superb, with perfectly cooked meat and an excellent sauce.  Every time I've been there, service has been classy, friendly and attentive.  All Bravo restaurants I've seen are sparkling clean and immacualte, even the restrooms.  In a sense, I hate to write a review like this.  I wish I could love the local places, supposedly run by real people with heart.  But almost all the local places I've seen have sloppy service, mediocre food and restrooms so dirty even a cockroach would be appalled.  It's downright embarassing for the best Italian place in Pittsburgh to be run by an impersonal chain out of Columbus.  But they do great work, and it deserves our appreciation - and patronage."}
{"text":"Order from the light menu.  The food on the regular menu is typical chain restaurant calorie loaded butterfest.  I have found every item I get on the light fairs menu to be taste really great and no be bad for me.  I applaud anyone who offers a lighter menu and theirs is one of the best around"}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my great-grandmother's birthday here and the service was amazing. Especially for a party as large as ours.   We had a private room and three menu options for everyone to choose from. We had absolutely no complaints for the food or the services. I had the berry sour cream friend toast (I forgot the specific name for it) and I loved it.   I wouldn't hesitate to book another party here."}
{"text":"Some Yelpers wonder why I review chains - obviously they don't understand that not everyone only goes to \"mom and pop\" places and Yelp originated as a place for reviews of businesses not just mom and pop places. So - with that being said - Bravo restaurants have become one of my favorite place to eat when traveling. Let me start with the good points.  First of all - though I haven't ever gone to the local Bravo in Buffalo, NY - all those I've been to have offered consistent excellent food. I don't rate all eateries with the same way - I typical rate one common type of establishment with the another. That's why a Burger King has the potential to be a 5 star and so too do the most famous places. Likewise - one of Chicago's most famous could potentially get a 1 star - hope that clears how I rate placed up a bit - for those who care.  On to this review - Bravo and this place was no different from the rest also consistently have great staff - their training/mentoring program must be good. They also know about the food because they actually taste everything - even things they don't typically like are tried so that they can offer informed advice to the customer!   Another common trait I've found at Bravo is that the place is clean - with attractive decor and their level of cleanliness and decor doesn't stop in the dinning section - they carry this level throughout including their restrooms, which also offer changing areas for infants.   They are always within our company policy, which also means that their is GREAT value here - and they accept all major credit cards. But the good things don't end there. Every meal is cooked perfectly and the deserts are just as good and always make for a fine ending to an amazing meal with a cup of coffee!  This place gets it all correct - staff friendliness, cleanliness, value, menu selections, specials, timeliness of serving your meal and of course typical parking. If I remain reasonable - it doesn't get better then this.   Though I am sure there might be an occasional bad experience - I've never had one - so if you have - don't think every trip will be the same. If it continues to happen to you - try being friendly yourself - you might see a huge difference in everything!"}
{"text":"This was the first time here and I ordered the Linguini Carbonara & had them add chicken to it. Wow, it was fantastic if I must say. I'll be bringing my wife with me the next time for sure to savor the moment."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Bravo, basically since it opened. I've never been disappointed by any of their dishes. Some favourites for me have been the salmon salad and portobello mushroom ravioli. I just recently discovered their happy hour specials weekdays starting at 5:30 (I believe). The food and drinks are all around the $5 mark and I highly recommend the crispy ravioli as well as the shrimp appetizers."}
{"text":"I always have good food and service here. I recommend the happy hour specials at the bar. The chicken spinach flat bread was great.  Although it's a little small and can get crowded it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times but haven't bothered to review it.  I try very hard to avoid chain eateries but am out of options in the area I live in sometimes and resort to desperation.  I like some of what they do.    I had the Tuscan Grilled Chicken Sandwich with green onion mayonnaise and spicy Tuscan slaw. Served with a salad of field greens, Roma tomatoes, Gorgonzola, Mediterranean grain and balsamic dressing.  It was over $10.  The chicken was really dry and burnt in spots.  It wasn't great.  Overall the value was borderline.  I was really even more outraged at what Miriam got when she ordered soup and salad.  This was over $8 and you should have seen the portion.  I couldn't believe it.  It was like a cup of greens and 1/2 of their tiny little tureen of soup.  Seriously?  How much does lettuce cost?  I don't know if she loved it.  I was too busy wondering why they would send this out.  The pick 2 at Panera with soup and salad is $2 less and you get more food than this.  I am not a fan of Panera but the food seems par when you get down to the soup and salad she got.  I haven't been bummed out enough in the past to bother writing.  Mostly we go for dinner.  The chicken Marsala is pretty good and the chicken Romano salad is also one of my standards and is aok too.      I hate the bread they send out and always opt out.  It's trite with their little pool of olive oil and the bread is of poor quality.  I guess I am just a little tired of this place and was especially disappointed with our last visit.  We had one last year that was pretty bad too."}
{"text":"I really can't stand chain restaurants, but we wanted Italian and Bravo was our choice. I feel so guilty admitting that I really really really enjoyed my salad, soup and bites of my fi's pasta. The restaurant itself is HUGE and open with lots of windows that makes the place feel more spread out than it really is. Our waitress was more attentive than she should have been (def not a fan of the overly-friendly waitress) but other than that, it was a good experience and i'm sure we'll be back at some point."}
{"text":"Bravo is always a great treat for my family when we visit Eton.   I can depend on exceptional service, cleanliness, and a wide variety of options.  During our last visit, Tyrell, our waiter was outstanding.  He even brought out some dough for the kids to make their own buns!  It's things like this that leave an unforgettable impression.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We ate there right before Christmas with friends that recommended the place. Our food was mediocre, not the way we wanted it, and the service was terrible. I chose not to make a big fuss (my dinner was the one most screwed up) to make for a nice evening. The restaurant NEVER responded to a survey I filled out - so they must not give a darn. I would go to almost ANY OTHER Italian restaurant (Macaroni Grill, Olive Garden, Carrabba's) than return here. The prices do not fit the level of food quality and service!  PS - It's been over a month since our visit and no feedback from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was just ok . Had the fish and chips FYI only a Friday lent special, it was very good . I think something is wrong with there soda machine the last 3 trips the drinks have  tasted awful . I now will only order wine .Prices are a few dollar to high in my opinion and parking is a nightmare at certain times ."}
{"text":"After reading a few Yelp reviews, it's apparent that the management and staff have taken note and are really excelling. We came for brunch and had a great experience. Our waiter Henny (that's Henny) not Henry, was phenomenal and honestly helped to elevate the experience to feel like we were in a much more expensive restaurant. We ordered the dessert trio and it was spectacular. We would return and request Henny again, overall, a great meal in a very comfortable atmosphere.  5 Stars."}
{"text":"Food (7.5/10) = Came here with family and ordered the following dishes:  1) \"Calamari Fritti\" appetizer = Not great, but not terrible.  It is mostly batter, so after the 4th or 5th bite, I got tired of it.  Each piece contains about 20-25% of calamari meat and the rest of the 75-80% is batter.  Served with marinara sauce and horseradish. 2) \"Spaghetti & Meatballs En Sugo\" = this dish was listed under one of their specialties.  Again, this dish wasn't terrible, but nothing outstanding.  You get 3 meatballs which are made with pork and beef.  The meatballs were ok.  The spaghetti and the tomato sauce just ok as well.   3) \"Meatball & Pepperoni Manicotti\" = another dish listed under their specialties.  Flavor was good, but this dish is heavy.  It's topped with a red pepper cream sauce.  You get 3 of these.  Did not taste much meatball or pepperoni.  Could not find any meatball or pepperoni after dissecting one of the manicottis. 4) Grilled tilapia and vegetables = the healthiest dish I got to sample, lol.  But even then, you can taste an element on butter everything. Fish was ok.  Vegetables ok.  Overall, this dish was just ok like all the other ones I sampled above.  Ambiance (8.0/10) = a fairly relaxing environment.  Well decorated.  Spacious.  There is a pizza oven immediately to your right as you walk into the restaurant.  In the far back, you can view the line cooks in the kitchen preparing your food.  Service (7.5/10) = standard  Overall opinion = This place was just ok.  Came here because I didn't want to take family to a chain restaurant (chain restaurants dominate this commercialized area).   Unfortunately, I didn't know this was a chain restaurant until after the visit.  This would explain why the quality of the food served at Bravo reminded me of Olive Garden.  Large quantities of meh flavored, heavy rich food."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for birthdays, anniversaries and date nights. But lately the food has been sub par, the menu is shrinking and the service has been slow. The two times we've tried to go there for lunch, well I'm glad that we weren't on a work day lunch or else we wouldn't of gotten to eat."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Parking can be tough to find but I was lucky to find a close spot. Bread is good. My friend got the Alfredo and she said it was ok. I got the lasagna and it was good. I think they are a little pricey for what it is compared to other Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot! When some of my friends from Jersey visited one time, I took them here and since then, one of them can't stop talking about it! I think he'd visit Pittsburgh again just to eat here again.  My favorites are the shrimp fra diavolo and the pasta bravo chicken. They're both so good! Sometimes the shrimp fra diavolo is a little different. Sometimes it's SUPER spicy, sometimes it's just right, sometimes it's not spicy at all and is a bit spicy. I wish it stayed more consistent, but regardless, it's still really good. The pasta bravo is always good. It was the first thing I tried and still one of my favorites.   They also have really good pizza. Their margherita pizza is really good.   Of course, my favorite appetizer, the calamari - so delicious. I've always been happy with it. Comes with two delicious dipping sauces and it's perfect size to share with a friend.  I also love how they have white paper over their tables so you can always draw/write while your'e waiting for your food. (:  The wait staff is always really friendly and one time during the summer, I got re-fills! That made that experience so much better.   The interior always looks nice. It has an ancient Italy feel and in the back, you can see the cooks and brick ovens. Some restaurants feature outdoor seating which is real nice when it's warm outside. You could definitely come here for a casual meal with friends and family or come for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Food was \"good\" but expensive for what it was. $15 for tortellini with sausage seemed high but you could tell the pasta was fresh and the sauce was very good. I gave this place 3 stars for two reasons: -after call in at 7:05 on Saturday to get our name on the list for a table on the patio for 3 people, we were told \"about 30-40 minutes\". I thought no problem. We're 20 minutes away and I don't mind waiting a little. After sitting around for a really long time we were finally seated...at 8:50. A full hour past their projected wait time. -the other problem I had with Bravo was the lookaway I got when I signaled to the blonde service person with the water pitcher that I needed more water. She looked right in my eyes and kept walking. Twice. -bonus issue: the three ladies up front to seat people (I guess that's what they do, I couldn't tell) seemed more interested in hanging out behind the podium instead of working that hard. No apologies at all for the hour and forty minute wait. They acted as if it was normal.  Would I go there again? This was my first time there and I'd give them another shot. Last chance."}
{"text":"I'm going five stars because we had an excellent waiter, his name was Robert S according to my receipt, which I kept for the past few weeks in my wallet just so I'd remember it for this review. Will be back for sure, the food was quality, and I'm interested to try some other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We bas an large dinner party. The waitress was no where to be found, we had to seek out the manager. The food was average at best and the service was horrible for a weeknight."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner. We are a diverse group which makes get together a interesting. I like seeing what everyone orders. Tonight there was pizza, salmon, pasta, salads and a few other items. I ordered a cup of Wedding Soup to start. It was bland, mostly broth and had a total of two meat balls. If I drained the soup I might get enough tiny pieces of pasta to make up a teaspoon. I was very disappointed.  For my main dish I ordered the Insalada de Lacasa. It is a salad tossed with a Parmesan dressing. I ordered chicken on top. When my salad came it was the wrong salad. I rarely send food back but I sent the salad back as soon as I saw that it was wrong. The salad was okay but the chicken was dry. Again I was disappointed.  My order was simple yet it was wrong and the food was \"meh\" to quote the Hipsters. The only reason for 2 stars was the service. Our waitress was very nice and kept our drinks filled. Ashe also came to clear our dishes as soon as there was an empty plate. One of the waiters even took a moment to take our picture for us. It's too bad the food wasn't as good as the customer service."}
{"text":"This is a big hit or miss kind of place.  nice atmosphere, friendly staff... maybe a bit rushed.  the food has been really good on some visits and just okay on others, therefore 3 stars.  I agree with Nunya that for the price Armstrongs is a better choice, not as nice, but the same quality food."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! I had the crispy shrimp Napoli for appetizer and the sauce was very good!! For entree I had the crab and shrimp cakes. So rich and tasty!! Also the vegetables are very good. Our server was friendly and helpful! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. The food is decent and the drinks are good. I keep coming back, but I'm never wowed honestly. Yesterday I had the fried ravioli (needed salt oddly) and the chicken scallopini( I thought it's be better with less cheese and more sauce. My drink was great (amaretto sour). What does bum me out is the fact that the dishes that have wowed me, have been taken off the menu. I loved the carbonara and the salted Carmel pretzel blondie. I understand that places change menu items due to seasonality but I have yet to find something as good that replaced them. Sad."}
{"text":"We do not shop at ross park mall very often, but when we do, we always stop at this bravo! It's never crowded during lunch and that's why we love it.  (Unlike the resteraunts at the mall).  We always have a pleasant experience and the service is always top notch.  Today we went during brunch and it was fantastic!  Our waitress was just delightful as well! We will continue to come !"}
{"text":"Just normal chain restaurant fare. One thing I do appreciate is the artisan pizza samples at check in. That was delicious. Because it was free.  Otherwise, slightly higher end Olive Garden. Nothing phenomenal but nothing catastrophic either."}
{"text":"Thankfully our server had a sense of humor or this would have been a lower rating. I know they are better than this experience we had this weekend. It must have been a long weekend at Bravo with the nice weather for patio dining. They were sold out of a couple of the steak dishes. Service was a struggle. Flagged down a server after 15 minutes who offered to take us and he did his best as he was running around a lot. Again he was very nice. Lasagna was good, the lobster ravioli with shrimp was ok though barely warm. Location is still the best part."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Cleveland for work, my coworkers and I ate at Bravo our first night.  We all ordered various salmon dishes and overall were happy with our choices. I ordered the salmon pasta, they basically just threw a whole grilled salmon on top of pasta.  Interesting visually but the salmon was so good I didn't mind.  The food wasn't anything spectacular but it was good enough that I wouldn't mind returning.  The service was pretty good overall.  The waitress was attentive and kept coming to check on us.  I was appreciative of the fact that my water glass was constantly being filled and that they brought us more table bread without us having to ask.  An overall pleasant experience and I would come back if I am ever in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in again for happy hour with friends  Beautiful day so I sat on the patio. It's really pretty out there. I was happy that they had heaters since there was a chilly breeze.  Service was fast and my martini came quickly and was perfect.  Ordered two shrimp appetizers. This time they were hot and perfect coated with sauce  I had ordered one sautéed in the sauce rather than breaded. Both ways they were great. My favorite thing on the menu  I got the chopped salad ,as usual, and it was cold and super fresh.  My 8 oz filet was a perfect medium rare and this time the green beans were also perfectly cooked  The manager Stopped by the table to check on everything. I love that touch  This location has redeemed itself  The staff and food was great!! I will certainly be back. Especially for the happy hour bar menu and dinner  Easy parking in the lot next to building"}
{"text":"This place has a new manager and is breathing new life into this restaurant   The dishes are being served with care again and if your selection isn't right he will fix it. The shrimp Napoli it worth the trip there since parking can be a problem   Lots of fresh entrees   Lasagna is always good"}
{"text":"A noisy place, but the food is generally very good. They used to have better breads when for when you were seated and could use them in the dippy olive oil. Now the bread is kinda cardboardy with some herbs and spices. Not real authentic Italian. They used to have wood-grilled chicken salad on the menu and they will serve it if you ask. It's just strange to alter a menu when you know previous items were in demand and pretty good."}
{"text":"We don't often get the opportunity to eat here, but it is one of the best chain restaurants, and this comes from someone who would rather eat at a non-chain restaurants.  The pasta bravo, sausage tortellini and eggplant Parmesan were wonderful.  All had different tasty sauces, we're nice and hot and extremely tasty.  Service was great, so overall good experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, but below my expectations. I feel like they \"Americanized\" the dishes. Where's the garlic?!? The marinara tasted flat and the bread they served was stale. I have to say that our service was really good, we did sit at the bar and the staff was very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"Bravo! is opening up in a couple of days but I had the opportunity to attend a pre-opening dinner to help train the staff.  We started with the Margherita Stuffed Flatbread then the Lobster Bisque and Insalata Della Casa.  For our entrees we had the Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka and the Veal Parmesan.  For dessert we had the Torta Di Cioccolata.  I recommend everything we had and I'm looking forward to trying other dishes as well.  They also have a great patio area that opens up onto the common area which will be great for the summer concert series that just started.  I also appreciate the very reasonably priced kids menu.  Very happy to have Bravo! in Blakeney and looking forward to eating there when it opens on April 24th"}
{"text":"Bravo, like Olive Garden, have been consistently good over the years. Prices are reasonable and service has always been acceptable. The veal marsala is great. Probably one of the best creme brule I've eaten."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Bravo before, and it was always just an average meal. This time that I went, I had possibly one of the worst dining experiences in my life. First off, when I went to use the restroom before eating, it smelled like a carnival outhouse. Completely disgusting. There was urine on the floor. If I hadn't been so starving at the time, I would have walked out. We asked for bread (during previous visits, it was brought out after beverages) and the waitress said, \"oh you want it now?\" Which rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered the Chicken Scallopini and asked for her to leave the Chicken off of it because i don't eat meat. She made a confused face and asked me if I wanted something instead, but I didn't know what options I had, so I just asked her to add extra mushrooms to it. When I got my dish, it looked... sad. There were two whole portobellas laying beside some twirled pasta. The portion seemed small compared to my friend's spaghetti. As I cut into the mushrooms, I saw that they were scalloped horizontally, almost paper thin. I have never in my life seem a mushroom cut that way. I had many bites that were just stem. The mushrooms were also extremely undercooked. It was hard enough to find something to eat because they don't have vegetarian options other than salad and eggplant parm. (I don't like eggplant). I didn't return the dish because I couldn't bare to be there anymore. I will never go here again. This place has awful service, dated recipes, high prices, and paper on their tables, on top of the table cloth. (Thought that seemed trashy)."}
{"text":"Excellent meal with Italian wedding soup and the Mahi special.  What was really over the top was the extraordinary service by Vickie R.   I am traveling on business and forgot my phone charger.  I asked Vickie if she could assist and Vickie got my phone charged!   That is the kind of support all companies in the service sector should consider.  Stock phone chargers for Apple and Samsung and you will make most people happy.  Kudos to Bravo and also to Vickie R."}
{"text":"Everything closes early around here nice to be able to pick up some good food after 9"}
{"text":"Took Grandmother out for dinner, was nice that we could make a reservation so close to the time we would be arriving.  Was seated quickly, and got drinks quickly also.  Bread was still baking, and we got it soon afterwards, still hot from the oven.  Received our food quickly, also.  Overall, a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to find yourself eating when you need to celebrate a special occasion.  We came here to celebrate my grandmas 89th birthday, and we left feeling satisfied and full.  Real quick, just gotta say we were not too happy with the hostesses.  We had a reservation for 5 and they did not even have the table set for us.  Also they tried squeezing the 8 of us at a 6 person table even while the restaurant was completely empty.  It didnt make any sense, but we got it sorted out eventually.  The delicious food that followed the whole debacle made me forget about the whole incident.    The appitizers we ordered were super.  The bruschetta was out of this world.  We were all in agreement that it was one of the best bruschettas we have ever had.  The calimari was also very tasty.  My mother and I also split a salad that had Gorgonzola cheese in it.  It was also delicious.  Everybody's main courses were all devoured.  My mother's lobster ravioli was delicious; of course she let her boy try it.  My dad's shrimp pasta was completely finished off.  Also, I ordered the tilapia with crab, and I found myself eating it so slowly just so I could enjoy it fully.  I was even able to order which kind of veggies I wanted on the said with it, and believe me when I say they were great.  Since we were celebrating, dessert was something that had to be ordered.  They brought my grandma a cup of gelato with a candle in it; very nice gesture.  My dad ordered the big threesome plate of desserts: tiramisu, chocolate chip cake, and chocolate melting cake.  All three of them were great, so if you are the kind of person that likes sampling different desserts, go with the threesome plate.  My mom and I ordered the apple pie dessert and the cheesecake.  Both were good, but nothing too out of the ordinary with the apple pie.  The cheesecake, however, did have a sugaring glazed cooked onto the one side of it.  That was a very nice and tasty touch.    Like I said, this place is a little more upscale of a restaurant.  If you are going on a first date or celebrating some event, you gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the most delicious lunch entrees I have ever had.  I had the ravioli filled with Chianti braised short ribs.  Warm bread was good.  Very professional server.  She did everything she  could to ensure that we had an excellent dining experience.  I subtracted one star because it took FOREVER for our entrees to come out.  The food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday night for my birthday and I just have to say from start to finish it was an incredible experience! Our server Chris was phenomenal, knowledgeable , friendly, and efficient. The food was also great. I can't wait to come back and ask for him as my server again!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chain Italian restaurants. The service is pretty good, the food is great. Definitely the best tiramisu I've ever had!  The salmon pastas are simply the best. The bread and dip they serve initially is pretty soft, and tasty too! Keep in mind, the food is great but also high in calories ;-)"}
{"text":"My problem is that they had ZERO beers on tap and NO local beer. Shrimp appetizer was awesome. Our group of 10 thought the good was good. Service excellent. Price reasonable. But come on! No local beer in Charlotte? They won't survive. I saw someone buy beer at Brixx and bring it to the Bravo patio."}
{"text":"Better than Olive Garden I guess, but reservations are meaningless. They are an hour behind schedule. Won't be back ! ! !"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow. My boyfriend and I went after church which is understandable why service was so slow, but we didn't even get a refill of our glasses until we asked for the check and it was empty for a while before then. It took forever for our food to get to our table but the food was amazing. Its a bit pricey so I'd suggest the lunch/brunch menu but overall its a nice place and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had some rather fabulous service at Bravo! this past Friday.  Lisa went above and beyond and here's how it went, before an early movie at Loew's:  Drinks:  We each had two and they were reasonably priced and tasty.  Salad:  We split the house salad - actually Lisa split it for us, which almost never happens.  No muss, no fuss.  Pizza:  Sausage Broccoli.  It was just the right size for (2) to split, but ONLY if you split the salad, first!  It was done to perfection, perfectly spiced and the crust was just the right mix of crisp and soft.  I'm not a fan o' the food chains, but Bravo! (and Lisa) certainly delivered a great start to our weekend."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My boyfriend and I tried it out yesterday for the first time and it was so nice. We went around 4:30pm on a Thursday and were seated immediately. The waiter was super friendly. The food was fantastic! We got the shrimp bruschetta for an appetizer. For entrees I got lobster ravioli with shrimp and my boyfriend got grilles salmon with asparagus. Everything was great and worth the price. Even though I don't feel it was overpriced. This will definitely be one of our new spots!"}
{"text":"My second time here to give them a 2nd chance. Everything fell short of the mark. Yuk. My pasta Yolando was not well seasoned. Also, what was supposed to be spinach was actually unidentified weed 0f some sort. Spinach has found leaves. This had palmate leaves with serrated edges.... definitely not spinach. When I showed the difference to the waiter (see photo) which I placed side by side on the bread plate - he shrugged. I insisted he take it back and show the cook as something is not right.   I just got the bill in return. No apology. No explanation. Nothing. Aside from the weed-disguised-as-spinach - the food in general is not seasoned well. It was conspicuously absent of classic Italian touches such as fresh herbs as is prepared by top rated Italian restaurants do.   And the putrid bread \"dip\" tasted like recycled, rancid, cooking oil with smashed dried tomatoes (of equally poor quality) added to cover the awful, don't-think-its-olive-oil taste. Actually made me nauseous and regret dipping my bread into. The manager should hire me as a consultant. I've spent 2 years in Italy and traveled the entire country for 2-3 months at a time on over 11 visits. This is not Italian by any definition - not even American.   Terribile? Yes. Bravo? No."}
{"text":"Not going to waste my money here ever again. Went about a month ago and got the shrimp fra Diablo that was so hot I couldn't eat it. Went back a week ago and got a salad that was not fresh and looked like it was sitting in dressing for an hour. Had to send it back. Then I got my chicken and it was pink. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Stopped by after watching a movie. Service and food was great. The tomato bisque and the Bravo chopped salad was out of the world. We got to customize the pizza and it was good too. The only downside was the wait time for pizza. Overall, Value for money!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service left more to be desired. Me and a girlfriend sat in the bar's patio and were forgotten. Our server was inattentive and unemotional. I would not recommend if you get this particular service."}
{"text":"The food was good - best tiramisu I have ever had anywhere, and I have traveled to Italy several times.  The service was attentive and helpful.  One quibble, our waitress really butchered the Italian pronunciation of several items on the menu.  This is basic Italian, and it's a little disappointing when they get it wrong.  Very suburban.  I have been to Bravo's several times over the years and have been disappointed that I never get to try the pizza there, since they don't offer individual size portions."}
{"text":"Very pleased. Filet cook fantastic. Salmon perfection with citrus glaze. Vegetables crisp. Hostesses happy, lively and fun. Jamie allowed us to enjoy our dinner, attentive but not hovering."}
{"text":"First of all, the dishes are all arranged beautifully, though for a fancy-looking (chain though, I think?) restaurant like this, I would expect no less!  I came here with my boyfriend last year and ordered the Berries and Cream French toast off the brunch menu. It wasn't particularly memorable, but much better than french toast from places like IHOP, say. It had a fluffy texture, with no sogginess. My boyfriend thought it was far too sweet, but I liked it (I have a major sweet tooth though). He also deemed the signature Pasta Bravo! that he ordered \"delicious.\"  This year, I came alone for the free appetizer loaded onto my account and sat at the bar. I ordered the Meatballs and polenta and my gosh, it tasted AMAZING! The meatballs were tender and juicy, while the polenta underneath was creamy. The bitter taste of balsamic vinegar mixed in throughout blended well with the salty and mildly sweet tones of tomato sauce. The bartender  (who was also very cordial and attentive throughout) also brought me a free bread basket with what I suppose was Bravo's special dipping oil - it looked like tomato olive oil. The bread was warm and so soft on the inside, while slightly crispy on the outside.  I will definitely be visiting more often from now on!"}
{"text":"The servers seemed hurried and anxious, the place had just opened up, the Hostess was a friendly and very attractive young woman.  The Wedding soup was bland and seemed like it was out of a can.  The Penne Mediterranean wasn't any better. The pasta was undercooked, not even close to adante, their were four spinach leaves and what looked like a couple of sun dried tomatoes in the dish.  The Feta cheese failed to make an appearance,  a small amount of pine nuts rounded the dish out so that the Penne Mediterranean came out of a bag, or the chef did not care."}
{"text":"Had to ask four different times for silverware. Finally just went back into the restaurant and asked the hostess. Food was luke warm and asked for the manager and he never came by.  Mom ordered coffee and also asked twice for sugar. Never offered refills or anything. Table behind us had bad experiences too. They got up and left without paying or eating more than a few bites. Honestly I never write reviews but this was awful service."}
{"text":"I came here such a long time ago!!  I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  The food was good, the portions were a little smaller than what I am used to.  We came on a weeknight and it wasn't too busy.  There was no wait to be seated which is always nice.  The sauce on the fettuccine alfredo was pretty good.  The bread is delicious.  The service was very quick and friendly.  Overall not bad. I wouldn't mind trying this place again."}
{"text":"Went for an early (5:45) dinner with another couple last evening.  Saw nothing wrong with cleanliness of the facility, and server was pleasant enough.  All had the Italian wedding soup.... Very good.  I had the eggplant parm. Was just so-so. This was due to it being very obviously under a heat lamp too long. Hot plate= dried out food!!  Pasta sauce got to that dried out stage. Probably would have been enjoyed better if timed correctly.   Apparently we overstayed our welcome, in a half empty restaurant , because server removed our drinking glasses without asking if any refills were needed.   With two great independent Italian places nearby, you would think they would try a bit harder."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here with my mom. I ordered the seared salmon salad and she ordered the Mediterranean roasted veggie salad. Both were delicious and fresh, a great lunch portion and had a delicious variety of textures and tasty seasoning. Highly recommend! You can eat outside on the patio too in the warm weather."}
{"text":"Went with a big group for a celebration.  Service was really good.  Had two wait staff attending the group.  Had to wait for a few people but they seated us immediately and made sure we had drinks and appetizers - split flatbread Roma, Cheese ravioli artichoke & spinach formaggio - nice way to start.  Had the mista salad, very fresh greens and nice gorgonzola cheese and vinaigrette.  Had Margherita Pizza which was OK."}
{"text":"Awful experience! I frequent Bravos on McKnight and even have a frequent diner's card. Have to admit that there have been  inconsistencies in food and service in the past. But last night (Thurs) a friend and I went for happy hour. We sat at the high top table in the bar area. There was another table of four next to us.   No one approached our table for at least 15 minutes. The folks at the other table were looking around trying to catch the attention of the waiter. They wanted a drink refill.  I don't know what this waiter's problem was, but he was certainly not \"waiting\" on anyone. Eventually he did come and plop down the menus..took our drink orders,,,never asked if I wanted anything in my martini...I could go on and on.   And my food was awful. Ordered the scallops marinara. The scallops were the smallest I have ever seen even for bay scallops. It was very spicy as well.   The only redeeming event was that the GM came over to ask about our experience. Once I complained, he went right over to talk to the waiter. I wish I could say that this helped. It didn't."}
{"text":"I hafta say it's my first outing for Italian and I know that this is not the best example of authentic Italian, however my experience here was very good nonetheless. We had low expectations and came here because A lot of other places were booked but we have no regrets as everything that we had was delicious and our waitress Tonya was incredible attentive knowledgeable and on the ball!! We had the Caprese salad and it was delicious. I should've ordered another one. I ordered The lobster ravioli and I have to say it was quite good. . It had some type of a tomato cream sauce and it was very good. The pasta was cooked perfectly and although we didn't have any chunks of lobster it definitely had a lobster flavor. My boyfriend had a pasta with sausage and that was just as delicious. The desserts were beautifully prepared and delicious as well. I go back for a quick local fix of Italian if I had to."}
{"text":"The service is good as I love the atmosphere but the food is soo not at the level that I expected it to be. If I am going to pay that much for a fancy meal in a fancy restaurant it should at least be tasty and not so obviously from a frozen bag."}
{"text":"Went here about a week ago. I decided to get take out and ordered a chicken parm with a side salad and spaghetti. When I called in the order they told me about 40 minutes minimum. I went around and did some errands and then came back about 20-25 minutes after ordering. I went in and the lady behind the counter was nice and was friendly. The system for take out is not good at all. I walked in and the lady behind the counter had to get another person then that person came out and took my credit card. They took credit card and disappeared into back and then came out with food and receipt. The process from the time I walked in to the time I walked out was at least 10 minutes. The food was already ready when I came in so it sat there getting cold while they where getting the payment thru. They told me at least 40 minutes it was less than 25 if I would of come at the 40 minute mark it would of sat for 15 minutes getting ice cold and then the 10 minute ride home as well. Now for the food, I have too say the only good part of the meal was the salad. The chicken part was not good and I did not like the taste of it also it was ice cold besides. The spaghetti was cold and the sauce was not that good as well. I do not think I would ever go there for take out again as the system for take out needs a lot to be desired as well as they do not know how to estimate food prep time. I also noticed many negative reviews so I probably would not go back ever again. I do not recommend Bravo for take out at all."}
{"text":"Bob the manager greeted our table and made sure we were satisfied with our experience. He was also helping the staff stock dishes which shows he is not only engaging with customers but he is supportive of his staff. Service and food is delish! We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Can be a bit pricey for chain italian food, and the walk-in wait times on a weekend will stun you. Can be very busy and noisy.  However, the food is a step up from Olive Garden and they do have gluten-free pasta and will work with food allergies.   The main question is that for these prices would you rather go somewhere that is not a busy chain restaurant......"}
{"text":"Hey Bravo, it's really tacky when your MANAGER/OWNER decides to create a Yelp account to tell reviewers how wrong they are. I guess since I was so \"wrong\" about so many things, that I am just going to revoke the rating I gave you previously. Because no one likes being lied to by someone who is supposed to be inviting you in to dine with them. So yeah. Enjoy this 1 star review, you deserved it. ;)  BRB telling corporate how \"professional\" you guys act on Yelp!  Reference the following objective evidence: http://oi42.tinypic.com/2akh2zs.jpg  PS: If you want to address a review, you make an owner account, claim this page as your own, and respond to reviews individually so that EVERYONE can see your remarks and you can't blatantly LIE to people about your products/services. Just FYI!  --------------------------  You know, I just realized--this is probably one of my only \"chain\" restaurant reviews. I usually prefer smaller, mom and pop type places or just non-chain restaurants. But Bravo! is an exception.  The food can be kinda pricey at times but my mum always saves coupons so we can all get a meal here and not break the bank too much! Also lunch menu is more reasonable prices. Just saying.  Things I have tried:  Lobster Bisque (too heavy, not worth it) Mista Salad (PERFECT salad! refreshing AND filling!) Chicken Milinase (sp?) with pomodore(sp?) sauce. (SO tasty!) \"Lobster\" and Shrimp Ravioli (not real lobster but sauce is so good!) Filet Mignon with beans and potatoes (pretty damn good but not worth the price.)  The day after, the food can be kinda oily looking which makes me wonder just HOW many calories I am consuming? LOL.  The servers are all great and friendly and they practically know us by name which is cool (or crazy, you decide.)  The desserts are amazing--I recommend the lava cake.  The alcoholic drinks seem overpriced and not worth the $ so I wouldn't really get one. Try their imported peach tea instead or a glass of lemonade. Yum!"}
{"text":"Yum! From the appetizer salad to the decor to the friendly and efficient staff, this place has it all! They were extremely helpful as we set up a 80th birthday surprise party, including letting us bring in a cake. Serving 26 of us was well organized, timely, and pleasantly done. Now, the food! There were limited gf menu choices for me and the menu wasn't completely accurate in that some gf meals weren't marked as such. A shared salad was well presented and the veggies were all fresh and crisp! I ordered a salmon with vegetables dish that had a balsamic glaze and it was fabulous! I didn't leave a bite! One low spot was someone's uninspired lasagna. Special shout out to Austin in the bar who was do wonderful while we killed some time ahead of time with apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I ordered a few meals from Bravo today using Doordash! It was great! Obviously I cannot comment on service or atmosphere but I can definitely rave about my salad! I got the soup and salad combo, choosing Insalata Della Casa because my coworker told me to, and I was not disappointed! I wanted more, I regretted getting the partial size instead of just a huge salad. The lobster bisque was good, warm, super rich! I couldn't finish it because it was so rich, but that's not a bad thing! I think my diet conscience side is thanking Bravo for that!!  My coworkers each ordered a meal as well and allowed me share their feedback. Cassie ordered the lunch combo getting the Insalata Della Casa and the Pasta Woozie, she said although her pasta was cold, it wasn't bad for being cold, it felt like re-heated dish. She loved her salad even more than I did but said that the bread that she liked so to dip into the salad and pasta was hard, which is a bummer but she said its usually amazing.  My other coworker Anastasia choose to order from the kids menu, this isn't unusual for her. And thats the bonus of ordering to deliver, they don't really say anything to stop you or check your age. She choose the Kids Insalata Bambino which she said was great and swears was as big as our half salads (if thats true I definitely recommend doing that because its only $2) and she order the children pepperoni pizza and it was huge, like bigger than a Pizza Hut or Dominoes small and it was only like $6 and it came with a little kid drink! She said she loves their pizza!  I totally recommend checking it out, or having it ordered, I included a door dash code which I think gives you a discount but its not hard to download the app and try it out!   http://drd.sh/0SNU32/"}
{"text":"A fellow employee retired today so she chose Bravo! as her last lunch with the company.  We made reservations for 33 people to be served family style.  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated in a large, private dining room.  Two waitresses took our drink orders and kept our glasses topped off.  We were served some delicious, fresh-baked bread.  Then we were served two family-style salads.  One was an veggie salad and the other one was veggies and bacon.  I tried the one with bacon and it was really delicious.  There was plenty to go around.  Then our main courses were served.  One dish was chicken and sauce served over angel hair pasta.  The other dish was shrimp in a creamy white sauce that was spicy over noodles.  Both dishes were really delicious, but I preferred the shrimp dish.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  Until today, I had not heard of this restaurant, but I see it again, I'll be sure to visit."}
{"text":"The restaurant is terrible. We came to celebrate a birthday and just had awful service. The lemonade was overly sweet and the steaks were burned. The servers messed up our orders again and again. We complained to the manager, who couldn't care less. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"What a great evening dinner on the patio!  Ben, our waiter,  was great as well. The shrimp was missing from my dinner but Ben promptly got some for a great recovery. Both dinners were great!"}
{"text":"I was at bravos February 24. We always get dessert there because they used to have the best desserts. Was there the week before and had the bread pudding which was very good. This visit the waiter said they have a new and improved dessert menu. It is new but it is not improved. There are three desserts and they are in tiny little cups. I told the waiter this is not new and improved. Last week the tiramisu looked so good I was going to try it this time. The couple next to us ordered the tiramisu in the little cup and said it was not good. They used to have the best desserts around. If you want to good food bravos has good food but if you're looking for desserts try someplace else."}
{"text":"My daughter and her friends which are in High School went to this location before their homecoming dance.  My daughter got a bowl of soup and her bill was $5.00. They all paid with separate checks. My daughter gave the server a $20 bill for her $5.00 check. They waited a long time for the server ( red hair server, she doesn't remember his name) to bring their change back. She finally waved him over, she asked him directly for her change and he said, \"I thought we were all square\" and walked away!!!  He knowingly kept my daughters money and the rest of her friends change.  She knows how to tip and was going to tip him. But he did not listen when she asked for her money. That is so wrong to take advantage of kids!! I called the Manager and still no resolution."}
{"text":"We didn't make it past the absolutely rude \"hostess\" to find out if we would like eating here or not.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bravo's has been a staple in the Galleria as long as I can remember! They have an ample amount of seating and a menu offering classic italian dishes. They start you off with some delicious bread and dipping oil. That dipping oil is one of my favorite reasons for always coming back to Bravo's. I could eat gallons of that stuff. Their insalata della casa is their house salad and is my go to. It has a yummy parmesean dressing. I am a fan of their grilled salmon. Their pastas are good as well. Overall, a nice place to grab dinner in the Galleria!"}
{"text":"Bravo has been a consistent home run on taste but the restaurant is truly showing its age. Things are getting sloppy. Service was top marks but the table only had one bread plate for 3 people and that plate was dirty. The cabinet where the drinks were coming from was rotting apart with visible mold growing out the bottom. Our server while one of the best ive had, did not know how to open a wine bottle after being at bravo a month. Thats his fault AS WELL AS management's. Should they not teach their employees? The biggest complaint I had was the plates the food was served on. Between the kitchen and the table the plate edges became covered in greasy finger prints. It takes no time to wash your hands and even less to wipe a plate off.  All in all still love bravo and will be back but c'mon guys. Look around yourselves and stop accepting mediocrity and strive to be better."}
{"text":"very disappointed, my wife and I visited the restaurant inside for dinner, I served the person does not have experience and we did not know the menu dishes.  I ordered a glass of red wine, totally dirty and wine glass with white stuff.  The dish to order for dinner, raw vegetables, and very dirty around the dish looks like it does not wash.  The manager came to the table and did not care. she said sometimes happens ..   Not going back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service here is the most consistent of any upper level chain I patronize.   They are always willing to modify any menu item to your liking.  Food quality is excellent and appealing.   If more restaurants took as much pride in consistency and clients as Bravo does, the restaurant industry would be revolutionized"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch today with a lifelong friend. We ordered from the lunch menu and enjoyed the food.  The restaurant had a nice late lunch crowd, the food came out in a timely fashion.   What I found to be unpleasant was that we were eating and the server dropped off the checks. We were not asked if we wanted dessert, which we did.  I was still eating and server asked if we were ready to pay. The  server took the money from my friend while I continued to eat my lunch.  There was no one waiting for tables so I can't understand what the rush was.  When I finished, I paid my check and we left.   My friend told me about the Bravo Rewards Card which I was interested in. I was advised that my visit today counted. Maybe I misunderstood because when I activated the card the visit wasn't on there. And since I paid cash, I didn't keep the receipt to possibly add on myself.  Word to the wise. Don't rush your clientele unless it is requested and refrain from offering inaccurate information. These are small inconveniences but it left a unfavorable impression about the establishment."}
{"text":"A pretty average place, we were seated quickly and staff was friendly. We sat outside and the patio was very comfortable. On the beer list it says \"ask about our current craft beer selection\" and when my dad asked our waiter he apologetically told us he didn't know, and ran inside to find out. We started with the calamari and the spinach and artichoke dip. The dip was fantastic! Our entrees were pretty mediocre though, my sister had the spicy scallop marinera and it was too spicy for her to really taste what she was even eating and my Pasta Bravo was kind of bland. Not the worst, but certainly not the best. waiter was kind enough to comp my sister's overly spiced pasta, I thought that was nice of him as we only mentioned that it was too hot in passing.  Our server was nice but not very attentive, we only had our waters refilled once."}
{"text":"As ive been waiting in my seat for ten minutes and no server has come by im going to say this place sucks before i even get the food.  My server who i will tell to go back to doing nothing in the back of the restaurant is already off to a stellar opening.  The gentlemen who came over to start me off will be getting the tip tonight.  At least he apologized for his num nuts associate."}
{"text":"Can't miss place.  We go often and never go away disappointed.  Nice staff that allow us to order off menu from time to time and the lunch specials are a great budget item."}
{"text":"What you see is what you get -- Italian food in a mall.  Better than the Olive Garden but less than \"real Italian\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Always fantastic service both times I've been for take out and to eat there. Genuinely nice people working there. Our take out is always meticulous. Top notch and a great dining experience!! Love that they're in Blakeney"}
{"text":"I loathe chain restaurants with a zeal that can only be described as fury, but Bravo! is one of the few chain options that I not only tolerate, I actually enjoy.  Bravo's focus is Northern Italian food, which is not your typical \"Americanized\" Italian.  Northern Italian style food is lighter, simpler, and fresher.  \"Americanized\" Italian is what most American's think of Italian; heavy/hearty red sauces, including heavy meat sauces, overloaded cheese, tons of pasta, and the only veggie in sight is a iceberg lettuce salad.   Having traveled to Southern France, near the Italian border, my wife and I love Northern Italian food and hate \"Americanized\" Italian.  The latter just makes us feel sick and bloated.  The single defining characteristic of Bravo that I notice is that there is a freshness level to the food that is not typical in other chain restaurants, and that has brought us here more than once.  For example, their pizza and flatbreads use real fresh mozzarella (not shredded and bagged) and fresh basil.  My favorite pasta dish has pine nuts and fresh spinach.      After multiple dinners there, my wife and I have always enjoyed everything we've ordered.  The flatbread appetizers are especially good; my wife often makes a meal of just the flatbread appetizer and a salad.   I typically get the Penne Mediterranean with chicken which is always good.  I like the fact that they use multi-grain pasta and the olive oil sauce is light, without being overly bloating like other heavy pasta dishes can be.  Another notable point is that their pasta dishes can be ordered in half sizes, but it's a little more than half the price of the full dish.   I usually order the half size pasta because it is more than adequate for me, the net bill is lower, and there is no waste to be thrown out (or brought home in a doggy bag).  My wife and I are also tiramisu freaks and try to sample each restaurants' version whenever we dine out and it's on the menu.  Bravo's version is very good, not the best I've ever had, but still very good.  Lastly, I've found Bravo to be kid friendly and have had success brining my two-year old there for dinner.  My wife and I usually go for an early seating (5-6pm) and during the summer sit on the patio.  The noise level of the restaurant or patio drowns out my toddler's occasional random noises, he especially enjoys coloring on the paper table covers, and the wait staff has been great with him.   In summary, my wife and I consider ourselves restaurant snobs and target patronizing independent places, but Bravo has turned out to be a solid option; especially when we have a kid in tow and need something convenient and casual enough for a toddler.  Bravo also has turned out to be a decent fall-back option when I travel on business and I'm stuck in a location that little other alternatives.  Unlike other chain restaurants, food freshness and quality doesn't leave me feeling disgusting when I leave there."}
{"text":"I love Bravo! It's a great family restaurant and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The service is always great and the good is always delicious."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and the restaurant has an imposing structure as you pull into the parking lot, the area in which is located has all kinds of retail and several high end brands. This place remimded me a bit of Victoria Gardens in Rancho over in California, in a smaller scale; so that alone was great. We had made reservations for dinner but was unnecessary, the restaurant wasn't busy, a curious item that was a bit off was the lack of dress code. Ok, moving on, we ordered the shrimp brushetta to start with and it was flavorful, creamy and why not perfect! As usual I had the salmon with sweet potatoes and roasted asparagus, just decadent. I must compliment the chef on the sauce creamy and subtle texture. We also had the Tortellini and our Lilly baby had a cheeseburger and fries which was big and tasty as well. Our waitress was polite and above efficient, she brought us a second round as we were about to be done with our first, we were impressed. She suggested dessert and now that was the best part of our meal, we had the apple pie a la mode and it must have been a homemade pie because it was one of the best apple pies I've had in a long long time. I would come back to this place in general was super good food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Bravo! I had the field greens starter salad, the pasta fra diavolo with shrimp and the chocolate lava cake. Everything was perfect. I only ate half my pasta because I knew I had to have dessert when I saw the tray being carried around ... And I wasn't disappointed. My mom has the chopped salad, baked salmon pasta and the cheesecake - she loved her food too! Also, their bread is amazing ... Amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was pleasant and quick. Unfortunately the chicken in my salad was raw in one section.  Update: Bill from Bravo never reached out to me."}
{"text":"For a chain, this place is really top notch. The food is fresh, well prepared, and there is something for everyone on the menu.   We have been to Bravo multiple times, and everyone always leaves very satisfied. The grilled entrees, especially the salmon and steak, are some of our favorites! They are usually perfectly cooked, seasoned and accompanied by great fresh sauces.  These dishes  may not be Michelin five star dining, but they blow Olive Garden out of the park. The food is also prepared fresh, unlike the typical processed blobs of pasta you get at the majority of chains in the area.  We have been here for happy hour, family gatherings, business dinners, etc., and have nothing negative to say. Great atmosphere, attentive servers, and some awesome happy hour specials!   The customer service is also wonderful and shod be complimented on their hard work! If you ever have a problem just let someone know and they will get it taken care of."}
{"text":"Great, small Italian places abound in Western Pennsylvania.  This isn't one of them.  The cavernous, faux-Roman interior looked like an exploded Cheesecake Factory.  The pasta dishes are that new-wave Italian that can be found in chains from Macaroni Grill to Carraba's - a red sauce verging on salsa.  I'm surprised they even bother to heat it.  Maybe they should sprinkle tortilla chips on top.  I guess I have a thing for comfort food;  I like mama's sauce.  And there are a lot of options around that are almost as good as mama's, if not better (although I'd never tell her that).  And they all include a salad.  But the place did do one thing I wish local restaurants would pick up on.  Waitresses are armed with pitchers of real, honest-to-goodness, brewed, unsweet iced tea."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was good, but nothing special. While you wait, they give you bread and dipping sauce which are tasty. I like that they offer lunch combos for about $14 which I got a their chopped salad and pasta woozie. I liked their bravo salad but the pasta was only ok. Our waitress also didn't offer to add cheese on top like they have in the past which was disappointing. Overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Alright so I went to Bravo for the first time today for lunch. This location probably opened just over the weekend or something, let's just say it's relatively new. Ok so let's get started, OH MY LORD!! It was magically delicious! (Lucky charms reference haha) so for starters we got the lobster Bisque, Italian wedding soup, and Caesar salad, they were all very flavorful. The lobster bisque can be a little salty if you interpret the taste wrong, but it's really more of a cheesy, potatoey taste and it's great. The Italian wedding soup was just flavorful overall, it was probably my favorite, I can't explain the taste you just have to try it. The Caesar salad, I thought it would be just like any other Caesar salad but I was wrong, the sauce is vet good and definitely worth trying. Now on to main dishes, so I got the sausage tortelloni and it was very balanced and flavorful. We also got the Lobster ravioli Alla vodka and it was not like others it had a nice sweet taste to it but it wasn't too sweet it was just right. We also got the meatball and pepperoni manicotti and it was very flavorful and warm on the inside. Then we got the pasta woozie and that was very good as well. Last but not least we got a special but I can't remember what it was called but like the others it was very good. We also got peach palmers, they were lemonade with a peach tea and those were pretty good as well. Let's just say I didn't write this long of a review because it was mediocre this place is great and the service is amazing as well. If price isn't too much of a problem, you need give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I forgot to review Bravo! from a visit back in November of 2014 so reviewing them now--they crossed my mind as I thought to myself \"I need to stop by Northlake on my way up to the mountains to get some climbing gear at REI\", which I'd visited also in November, then I recalled having dinner here.   Reading other reviews, it seems at times the service is a bit spotty, but that wasn't my experience at all. I sat at the bar as I was alone, ordered an Old Fashioned and ordered their Grilled Chicken & Vegetable Pasta, which despite its boring name actually was very good. The vegetables tasted quite fresh and the chicken was a generous enough amount despite this coming from their \"Lite\" menu. So it was robust in flavor yet healthy, too. I would not say the restaurant was horribly busy but it wasn't so slow as to worry the manager about it going under, either. The bartender was very prompt in taking my order and seeing the food came out swiftly. As I was traveling, I appreciated this and the general feeling of prompt yet not rushed service here.   So my take-away impression as someone who eats out a lot is this: for a mall restaurant it's pretty top of the game. If you're in a hurry try sitting at the bar if you don't have a huge party, because the bartender is sure to spot you and can't ignore you. The prices are reasonable, the portions pretty large, and the bar menu items very much deals for the amounts that come out (the ladies beside me ordered several so I saw what they had). I'd certainly return."}
{"text":"I'm very much into authentic Italian food and absolutely hate Italian chain restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality.    The fried ravioli was delicious and their horseradish sauce fantastic. My wife hates horseradish but she even enjoyed it as it wasn't too strong and had nice creamy texture.   The Chicken Parmesan was decent but nothing too extravagant. My pasta was slightly undercooked but I don't mind. Some people might though.   My wife had the short rib ravioli and it was extraordinary. I could eat that every day of the week. The sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"The food is tremendous.  You should definitely make reservations as they get a lot of walk-ins from the mall.  The menu is really extensive - and the wait staff is great at telling you about off-menu options - so you are not restricted.  The dessert tray is amazing and I would highly recommend saving room. Definitely take a moment and stop in - worth the try."}
{"text":"After shopping in Blakney on Sunday night Mom and I decided to stop at Bravo for a cocktail and appetizer, but ended up staying for dinner. For drinks, we enjoyed the White Peach Sangria, so light and refreshing as we dined at an outside table. After a recommendation from our server we chose the crispy shrimp Napoli appetizer, amazing. The shrimp is lightly coated and fried served over a cream tomato based sauce, so good. And, we also enjoyed the complimentary bread with a tomato based oil dip.   Enjoying the music and our drinks we chose the 6oz filet and shrimp and crab cakes to share. The shrimp and crab cakes were light and delish and served with red potatoes and veggies. The filet, perfect with spinach & appetizer. Look forward to getting back another night."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  Our home kitchen has been under construction for three weeks.  I have ordered a plethora of carryout and delivery from all over the area.  I've had a lot of bad experiences.  Besides pizza, this was the first restaurant that got everything right.  Ordering carryout on their website was terrific.  Everything was easy and self explanatory.  I didn't have to change anything, however, if I wanted to add an extra something-something, or remove an ingredient, there were boxes to check to accomplish that task.  The food was fine.  It was well boxed and, most importantly, everything was there.  Everyone that I spoke with, inside of Bravo, was also very courteous."}
{"text":"The food is great! The front of house staff is always a pleasure and the price is right!"}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant with great food. The atmosphere is amazing, with wonderful service. Some things are a bit pricy but the portions are large and worth the price."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna here during the Friday lunch rush. The food was served within 10 minutes of ordering! Awesome! This place is like Olive Garden v2 without the dumb ads or regretful \"we went to Olive Garden\" pity. Our waiter was the Greek guy and was pretty good. I'd wanted to try the pizza but the lasagna had filled me up.   Directional note: The address for Bravo is listed on Washington but it's closer to Gilkeson, so you'll want to park in the lot closer to the latter."}
{"text":"Seven of my colleagues went on Friday for lunch and order several appetizers, mixed drinks and entrees. Several of us order the Pasta Woozie and it was very salty we said something to the waitress about how salty it was one of us finally had to send it back.  I don't know if the chef accidentally put too much salt in it but don't order it to be on the safe side.  It was definitely money wasted.  The mixed drinks were tasty along with the shrimp appetizers. But no to the pasta."}
{"text":"Everything I ate was great! The bread, the mezzo flatbread and the eggplant lasagna was delicious. And the service was great as well. I highly recommend to anyone that loves Italian food."}
{"text":"Always a good local staple and their reverse happy hour is a fantastic deal.  Flatbreads, fried ravioli, salads, all for under $6.  However, they stopped serving happy hour drinks for late night (boo!) but they added beef carpaccio (yay!), so we are still happy.  We ordered a caprese salad and the carpaccio off the happy hour menu and both were great, although the timing of the items was off - our entrée [Pasta Bravo to share] came out before one of the appetizers.  The very friendly bartender sent our entrée back until we were ready for it.    The bar area was slammed and fun, so while this is a chain restaurant, it is a good option for a consistent Italian food and good happy hour prices."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a group of 12 and told them we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived our table only had 11 seats not 12, not a big deal they quickly added one to the end. However, our service was TERRIBLE,  the servers were not attentive and not friendly. We were there for 2 1/2 hours only to receive average food  and don't expect a refill on your drink cause it will take 20 minutes to get it, if you can wave down a server. The reason for our celebration was never brought up by the staff. The ladies room was very dirty and had an awful smell. If you are looking for a place to celebrate with friends and family......this is NOT it."}
{"text":"The food was good. But we were not very happy with the service. There were glasses of water already on the table ( we had reserved a table ) and our server never asked for any drinks we would like before taking the order. Then, they forgot the juice with Kid's meal.  Followed by charging for that juice that comes along with the Kid's meal. Then, we asked to split the check into two (70:30), and they swiped the cards with incorrect numbers. All in all it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my spur of the moment dinner at Bravo!  Oddly, this was my first visit to the restaurant.  I decided on Italian because I had a great experience in Paris earlier this year.  Bravo! had a pretty good selection for Queen's Feast.  I cannot complain.  I had the Calamari appetizer, Lobster Ravioli, and Creme Brûlée - $25!   I only ate half because I didn't want to feel like a glutton when I left the restaurant.  I was quite pleased with everything and of course the dessert was my favorite.  If they had given me a larger portion of Creme Brulee, I would have eaten ALL of it!   I added a glass of vino for $5.  Our waitress was very kind, as were the other servers who assisted during our meal.  I will definitely visit Bravo! again soon!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal. Came for my lady's birthday and it was a success! The Pettitte sized desserts are the perfect size. Management was always visible and friendly when making conversion. The food was so good I had to take an extra entree to go. I am one happy camper. Ask for Robert because he'll take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice and the first time was excellent. They had lamb chops and polenta and it was delicious.. was seated at a nice big table. The second time, the menu options and food quality went downhill- They didn't offer the lamb chops or polenta anymore, I even had reservations but was seated in a tight corner. I ordered a shrimp pasta and it wasn't anything to write home about. I don't quite understand why this restaurant gets so crowded when it's just run of the mill Italian food that you can get anywhere."}
{"text":"This location is very close to my office and we seem to go there a lot for business dinners.   To that point, we had a group dinner here recently. 25 people in a private room off the main dining room. The plan was to order straight off the standard menu. I saw a disaster coming.  Lousy food, Lousy service, and a loooong night.   None of that happened.   Instead everything was terrific. Everything.   A great time was had by all.   I had the veal marsala which one of my favorites there. It was just as it always is which is to say delicious. Maybe a bit pricey at $22.95, but I love it. So only 4 stars because some of the prices are a little high.  Otherwise a great place.  Check it out whether alone or in a group."}
{"text":"Very disappointed there was a lunch special for $14.99 came with super salad and entrée I questioned about the ravioli with the sweet potatoes and from the way it was described sounded delicious  I ordered the wedding soup and my guest had salads Our entrées came out before we were even finished with our soup and salad  I mentioned it to the server that I'm not finished with my soup she disregarded me didn't  offer to bring it back to the kitchen to warm it up very very rude then walked away , she needs a little education if she's going to be in the restaurant business she needed to be a little more cordial, she just walked away. Did I say the restaurant was empty So we saw the general manager and told him of the mishap he was very obliging he offered my niece and she lives here offered her a gift card which was nice I talk to him saying the sever need to know a little more education on how to explain the food and describe the dishes My guests  enjoyed their shrimp dish tho  Bon appétit"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch today.  Our first visit to Bravo ever and will be back.  The rattelle with sausage was very good and the Pasta Bravo was tasty.  Sweet tea was sweet and light,  not to heavy.  We will definitely be back to see our waiter Ben."}
{"text":"My first 2 experiences with Bravo were take out curbside.  I got salmon and was able to switch the green beans that it came with for mashed potatoes.  They were delicious with the salmon, which came with a delectable sauce.  The sauce the second time was a bit runnier but still good.  All orders are supposed to come with complimentary bread and oil that is seasoned so ask for it if they don't offer it.  My first order was ready when I arrived; the second order took a bit longer but a call to let them know I was outside waiting helped and gave me a chance to request the bread that I had forgotten initially.  The salmon was so good that I wonder if I'll venture out to try something else.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I was truly amazed at how an Italian restaurant chain could be so good!  From the bread to the dessert, everything was delicious.  My husband and I had a layover is Pittsburgh and went out to eat somewhere close to the airport and I honestly wasn't expecting it to be as good as is was.  Our waiter was fantastic too.  Too bad we don't have this chain in Texas."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place because it is at the mall and a chain restaurant... But I was pleasantly surprised! The food is really good! I went once for brunch - they have a lot of options and interesting menu items. I also went once for dinner - the Balsamic Chicken is great! Our server was polite and accommodating. I had an on-phone coupon (which typically they do not accept), but she went out of her way to talk with the manager to get approval for the coupon. If you're in the area, definitely go here instead of Olive Garden or PF Changs. You'll be glad you did! :)"}
{"text":"Went on a busy Sunday evening, party of seven. Had a short wait for a table, tho we had a reservation. Service was wonderful. Had nice children selections. I had the pork chop dinner which was delicious. The tilapia special had a hot spice in the tomatoes  that wasn't expected and was not preferred. Other salads and pizzas were quite good. I will try the Rustic salad next time."}
{"text":"The food was good. However our service was terrible! From the bread & oil plates, appetizer plates, and empty glasses our waitress left everything on our table! She got my husbands order wrong (not that he modified the dish, she just put the wrong order in) so i waited to eat until he got his then mine was cold (my fault) during the waiting process the manager saw I had a dish and he didn't and saw that she brought his our 15 minutes after mine and said nothing.. the food was good but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Worst service and the place is filthy. Every time Ive walked into this restaurant I've stood at the hostess stand for at least 15 minutes with out being acknowledged  waiting for my take-out order or to be seated. I needed two hands to count the number of times our waitress rolled her eyes at us. Very rude staff, really disappointed this bravo is in a decent location and I think  had potential to do really well"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain and perhaps this is almost the equivalent of writing a review of olive garden, but I have to admit after eating here a few times recently and feel the need to share my appreciation of this place. I'm really pleased with this small chain.  First, you should have the right expectations it's not Alla Famiglia (which I love), nor is it Alla Famiglia prices...  It's located conveniently right off of  Mcknight road in the chain food wonderland that is the North Hills.  That's another reason to share this review.  If you find yourself faced with the other wonderful chain dining options such as applebees, tgif, bob evans, chilis and the like you should give this place a try.  The restaurant itself is large and airy with very high ceilings and a large bar.  The kitchen is open and the staff is super friendly and professional.  There is plenty of outdoor seating.  Most recently I was here during the week for lunch and was dining with my sis', Heather...Mom and gf, Annie.  I arrived first and we were having a relatively early lunch due to an early afternoon meeting.  Our server was an adult who clearly did this as a profession and not just as a way to make a few bucks till college was over.   Annie arrived next then Mom and Sis' in short order.   The bread arrived and was served warm and fresh.  The olive oil mixture was okay and the server was happy to comply with Mom's request for butter.  I ordered the Hickory Wood Grilled salmon and started with the wedding soup.  THe wedding soup was very flavorful and served correctly piping hot with large meatballs inside.  The waitress complied with my request for the lemon caper butter sauce on the side and served me a perfectly cooked portion of salmon sprinkled with bread crumbs, very crispy potatoes and fresh green beans.  I do appreciate that much of what I'm eating is shipped in from elsewhere and I don't have a classically trained chef preparing it,  but I've paid 3x as much for meals that weren' t 1/2 as good.  Mom had the lasagne bolognese which was a huge portion of better than average lasagna with both a red and white sauce, easily enough for two or three meals for $10, Sis' had the frittata (italian omelette) and soup which she said was very good.  Annie had the margharita pizza which was pretty good pizza with a tangy sauce, crisp crust and sparse amount of cheese.  We were able to all enjoy a good meal with very friendly professional service and it cost me less than $60 for all four of us.  As chains go this is a good one and obviously, we yinzers appreciate it because of the six locations in the state of Pennsylvania, five are in the burgh'."}
{"text":"Bravo is good for an afternoon lunch, a Sunday brunch or special occasion. I've been to both this location and the location on Bethel Rd. in Columbus.  On my most recent visit, the staff was friendly- our waitress even smiled and made faces when my 6-month-old started to get restless.   I had the insalata della casa to start. The salad has lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon pieces and a creamy parmesan dressing. It's really yummy. For my entree, I chose the grilled vegetable pasta and added chicken. It was delicious! I loved the grilled flavor of the veggies with the marinara and the thin spaghetti. Best part is I had leftovers for lunch the next day.   I'll definitely be back. It's a place that never disappoints."}
{"text":"I first experiened Bravo Restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas.  Thank you for coming to Blakeney off Rea Road.  Finally a decent restaurant in this space. The only draw back is finding a parking place at Blakeney.  The food is delicious and offers a variety for your cuisine.  I have found the service to be slow and this coud because it is new or inexperienced waitresses.  It is a beautiful restaurant.  Ask for a table outside.  Make a reservation in advance if going on Friday or Saturday -- they are busy.  A fan."}
{"text":"Shit! My Bravo pasta tasted like a shitty microwave meal. Ridiculously overpriced. Service was lacking all around. Food was also chill less than like warm. I wish I would have gone across the patio to Brixx when I still had a chance."}
{"text":"The fried ravioli was very good, the pasta dishes were ok.  They reminded me of  the can Chef Boyardee...not what I expected.  The drinks were so so"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere of Bravo's is similar to an Olive Garden. It's not spectacular.   My chicken parm/Caesar combo was average, but a guest of mine was served a piece of salmon that was mostly raw...  Typically I wouldn't give two stars to a restaurant that serves ill prepared food, however, I was extremely impressed with our server's tact in handling the situation. She noticed the raw food on her own and immediately offered a replacement and comped the meal.   I'm not sure I'll be back, but if you go - rest assured that you will be taken care of."}
{"text":"My friend and I have eaten four times recently at Bravo in the Galleria. The food is very good, but the bar.... The bartenders are usually out of ginger beer, so no Italian Mules, which we both like. Then we ordered a rusty nail, but no drambuie! Who is in charge of the bar? Is this a systemic problem?  Walt Lemke, Ph.D.  Still no message or phone call following up the above.  Hmmmmmm"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is not full of sandwich or lighter choices but it's still a nice meal to have your family share. The service was good but it was a little pricey all in all I felt good about the meal. If you have kids ask to have dough brought out for your kids to play with."}
{"text":"For an appetizer we had antipasto on bruschetta that was very flavorful and perfect for sharing.  For my main dish I had one of the featured dishes... Mahi that was wrapped in bacon, served with potatoes, spinach, carrots and snappy pea pods.  Cooked perfectly and very delicious.  I don't order fish often, but could eat this dish over and over.  Hope it does not go away any time soon.  I would sum up as amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants at the Waterfront, and reasonably priced. Be sure to try the white sangria, yummy! The decor is wonderful and classy - everything that I have had there has been tasty. Also, it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Caesar Salad with bacon bits???? Really? No, thank you.  I ordered lobster ravioli. If there was lobster in the ravioli you couldn't prove it by me and the sauce was overpowering. The chicken Marsala was good as was the balsamic chicken. Service and atmosphere were ok. I'd go back but next time I will specify no bacon on my Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Had the salad rustica which was great, and the salmon from the light menu (I could eat that salmon every day)!   Server was very nice and outgoing.   2 pomegranate martinis made the evening even better!  I am going back for that salmon!!!"}
{"text":"We came here since we had a coupon. You can make reservations via their website which is nice. It takes you to OpenTable. I had the filet and it was delicious. My husband had the lobster ravioli. I was disappointed that they didn't offer baked potatoes and only mashed or sweet. The chopped salad was rather small and had a lot of black olives, more you would want on a salad. The service was quick but our waitress wasn't very personable."}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked to eat here because of the children's menu options.  Our kids finally had some place they could go and have healthy options and enjoy them.    We stopped by on Friday evening and found it had closed.  :o(    So Bummed!"}
{"text":"Insalata Della Casa get in my belly!!! The salad is so good that the rest of the food could suck and I would still give Bravo 5 starts!! But the rest of the food doesn't suck (shocking for a chain). Their pasta and pizza are very good. I remember having a pumpkin creme brulee during the fall once, I hope they bring it back because it was gooooood. You can't go wrong stopping in here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped at this establishment for the first time tonight after a shopping trip to Ross.   The first thing I saw was the bathroom. No paper towels. Urinal was clogged and there was toilet paper all over the floor. Not a particularly enticing first impression.   Moving on to dinner. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay, received my glass and there was something stuck on the glass that I had to wipe off (it was on the inside and gross).   Now the food. The food was actually very good. Better than I expected. I had their signature pasta bowl with mushrooms.   The only thing that deserved five stars was our waiter Lucas A. He was attentive, kind, knowledgeable, and fun. He made dining here a delight. Keep up the good work, buddy."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with this place.  I went here around 2005-6 if I recall and it was much better.  We got Calamari Fritti and Crispy Shrimp Napoli.  The calamari was over-cooked, chewy and flavorless.  We only ate 50% of the calamari because it was nasty.  1/5 stars.  The shrimp were probably the best tasting thing we had during the entire dinner.  5/5  I had grilled mahi-mahi and my girlfriend had the spicy scallop pasta.  Her dish was 4/5 stars and mine was around 2/5.  The fish was over-cooked and bland despite an advertised lemon butter sauce.  The vegetables were also bland and seemed as if olive oil was poured over them.  Add a glass of wine and 1 Yuengling and the tab was $75."}
{"text":"With the exception of my Pasta Woozie (subbed with shrimp) that I found to be on the bland side, everything else was top notch at Bravo. The server was fantastic, the calamari was a hit as always, and the cocktails were made well. I even made a mental note to stop by here for drinks at some point in the future. We tried the crispy shrimp app, and it was a nice compliment to the calamari. I notice there is always someone celebrating a birthday whenever I have dinner at Bravo, so it must be a popular dinner choice. I've never had an issue with my pasta before, so I'll chalk it up to a fluke. I have the leftovers in my fridge which won't be there for long, so it can't be too bad!"}
