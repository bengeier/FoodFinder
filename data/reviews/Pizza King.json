{"text":"Plus 1000  40 Plus year customer - simply the best ever!  Have eaten many, many pie's in my time....some real good but nothing compares to the original Pizza King in Munhall, Pa."}
{"text":"the nostalgia that goes along with this place for any bw alumni gives it enough stars to make you think of some random bw memory you don't want to forget.  no, you wouldn't want to go for lunch.  but late night?  where ya gonna go?  pizza king.  the late night pow wows my friends and i had at the pizza king were great times.  the food isn't bad.  not entirely the best pizza you've ever had, but darn good late night food.  yes, after bar food, too.  depending how you categorize it.  viva la pizza king."}
{"text":"these clowns never answer their phone. has been like 5 times on 5 different days.  i don't care if it's good or not...spend your money with someone who knows how to run a business in a professional manner."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice place to take the fam for some pizza, this is not the place!   The only reason you should come to Pizza King is if you are visiting a B-W student, a student, or a former student.   But, that being said, all B-W grads remember Pizza King with fondness. It is a landmark of Berea."}
{"text":"Grew up eating this pizza.  It's so good.  Back In the day it was located in Whitaker on Whitaker Way.  I'm no longer in the area but when I go home to visit my mom I always stop in and get a few half baked pies to take home and freeze."}
{"text":"My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...  This place?   A local favorite. The best sausage (it's shaved) *pause* Cheap square cuts. It's pizza in its simplest form. Great baked twice. Like Desalles, but up the hill."}
{"text":"Here's my update kids,  YUM!  My friends and I tried two mediums a few days ago. We went for the X-tra cheese with pepperoni, and the Greek Pizza (w/out olives). The Greek was a favorite for my friends who are feta-officianatos. I loved the Pepperoni, even if a tad on the salty side. The pizza's came w/ a pepperoncini on the side, a nice touch. We decided we will definitely be ordering again.  Pizza King, lighten up on the Pepperoni Pizza salt, and add some fresh garlic to your toppings list and you may make the 5-star rating!  Yay to George & the crew for bringing good Pizza to the Berea end of town!!!"}
{"text":"I have noticed that most of the \"landmarks\" and DELICIOUS places to eat (especially pizza) have very few reviews. I wonder why... If you have never tried pizza king and you like square pizza with a lighter crispy crust.... GO! They sell pizza...That is it! They sell by the slice, therefore you can custom your slices to please everyone! THE PRICES are a STEAL!!"}
{"text":"i love this place i have been eating it since i was a kid. i love the quality and they deliver which is awesome. the only thing that sucks is it's cash only."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here since I was a kid. Great square cut pie at a great price. If youre a fan of crunchy square pizza, i would recommend giving The King a try!"}
{"text":"Like Kimberly, I'm giving Pizza King extra stars for the memories!  Back in the 1980's, I worked for my dad's business, which used to have its offices at 19 Church Street, where the Church Street Mission Store is, now.  My dad and I used to go into the office early, before the rest of the employees would arrive, and after turning on all the lights and getting things ready for the start of business, he and I would walk up to Pizza King for an inexpensive (I believe it was 99 for the special) breakfast, the morning paper, and endless debates about politics and world peace. :)  I don't believe I've ever eaten at Pizza King for lunch or dinner, but I definitely have fond memories of breakfast there!"}
{"text":"This is good pizza, like the kind my mom used to make. I've lived in Munhall for 5 years and have never come here.   The pizza is square, and has a great thin crispy crust, even on the bottom.   The shop has one oven, one prep table and a cash register that only takes, well, cash.   You order your pizza with the toppings you want and that's it. I love simple places like this."}
{"text":"The only good thing about Pizza King is that they are open when the bars have closed, and so it has become a great place to drunkenly stumble into at 2:30 in the morning.  Agreeing with Kimberly, this place gets some extra starrage just for being the location of many memories that are near and dear to my heart.  Some of which would include me getting yelled at by a waitress for taking off my (painful) high heels and wandering away to another table obliviously drunk and barefoot, as well as seeing countless friends get in trouble if not permanently banned for trying to steal the items that decorate the walls.  But mostly fond memories of drunken friends having a drunken good time that can only be had when you're in college.  (After which, such experiences are considered alcoholism).  But the food... well, its pretty terrible.  I always tried to avoid getting pizza, their other italian dishes were... edible.  Not sure I can say the same for the pizza."}
{"text":"A must try is the Thin Crust Meat Supreme Specialty Pizza which is their 2012 National AWARD Winning Pizza. Thank you Pizza King for making Amazing Pizzas.!!! http://www.PIZZAKINGBE..."}
{"text":"Note: CASH ONLY and no dine-in.   Man there's some little cubbyhole pizza places in the Pittsburgh area. This would be one of them.   Me and Lady Kay wanted to attempt a pizza crawl in Munhall after finding out about the 7 or so outlets for pizza in this fine neighborhood. It got whittled down to just the 3 on Main Street, which became 2 after one of them appeared to have been replaced by a Chinese restaurant (we could be wrong about that, but that's how it looks).   The plan for this crawl (gauntlet?) was to sample a slice at each of the 7, but this evening it was just Pizza King and The Pizza Company.   Pizza King wins the duel. It was a square, cruncy crust reminiscent of Beto's or DiCarlo's aside from the fact that the cheese was actually melted. Black olives were our lone chosen topping. They don't put pineapple on pizzas in Munhall if the 2 joints we tried are any kind of indicator, much to the chagrin my little-flighty-one. We were on a budget too and therefore kept toppings to a minimum, leaving out the bacon.  I waited for a bit while Kay sat in the car and got into a nice discussion about football and music with the young kid behind the counter and the older gentleman who was waiting on a pie.  Then in walked a cop!  \"Oh I ordered the 10-cut.\"  Whew! lol.  I'm tempted to give a 5th star, only because the aforementioned pizza maker, who couldn't have been more than 16, complimented me on my Thin Lizzy shirt.  \"Nice shirt. Cool, cool band. Shame about Phil Lynott.\"   He had on a Van Halen tee himself. These kids today are all retro and junk.   And he knew Thin Lizzy, one of the most unheralded and sweetly melodic hard rock/metal bands ever!  The pizza was good and the kids are all right. I can sleep well knowing this."}
{"text":"My go to. Close to home cheap, good, pizza. Square cut pizza with a chunky red sauce. I get the \"tray\" 16 cut EBA (everything but anchovies). Can't beat it for 17 bucks. Love Pizza King"}
