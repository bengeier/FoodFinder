{"text":"This place is horrific. I recently ordered a regular cheese pizza for delivery. The delivery man was quite rude. After giving a 20% tip, he gave a grunt and dismissive hand sign. Now let me get to the pizza. Have you ever had one of those cheap frozen pizzas? Just imagine that, but more expensive, and worst tasting. You can tell that the crust is pre-made, and tough as rocks. And the cheese is horrifying. No flavoured, and consistency if slime. I will never, ever eat any \"food\" from this place again. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because that is as low as you can go."}
{"text":"They are BACK! The great tasting pizza I remember and all the original menu items with it like the original house salad to the real bacon on the caesar salad. The place may not be as fancy but who cares. I can say when you want great pizza for the family with a real Italian flair then you want to eat here. I will never go back to Dantes. I wish Paoletti's Pizzeria great success."}
{"text":"Great to have old school dantes back in action!! The pizza is by far the best delivery/take out in the area. 

Unfortunately, new location doesn't seem to lend to sitting down and ordering a meal. But take out is just fine! 

Thin crust well down is the way to go!!! It's great pizza, extremely pricey.. but worth I guess when you compare to the competition the quality speaks for itself 

I am a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"Having heard that Paoletti's Pizza is originally from Dante's and that Dante's had closed down, I was happy to try 
Paoletti's.
The good: size of the large is huge and so you do get value for what you're paying.
They are super generous with toppings and it covers the entire pizza.
The bad: not sure if it was just me but I found the pizza to be super salty. I have never had such salty pizza before so that was disappointing. 
I would go back if they could make it less salty because everything else was good but it's hard to enjoy everything else when all you can taste is the salt."}
{"text":"I'm hooked. If you do not want to take my word on how good the quality of the food is, look at the moron below slandering the company for \"blackballing him\". That is what you call..... Paoletti's withdrawal."}
{"text":"Best pizza around, the ingredients are fresh, generous and flavorful.  Vegan boy loves the veggies and sauce. 

We had thin crust, half cheese and all the garlic.  

Coming here is like coming home, I've been in the area for forty years and have been a customer most of that time."}
{"text":"I had heard that this place was pretty good, so decided to splurge and order this overpriced pizza for my Husband and I. Ordered a pizza and asked for it to be lightly done. It came to me very well done and when I called to complain they laughed saying that I was wrong. I'm like the cheese is burnt, I would like a new pizza or my money back. They swore at me and hung up. I threw the joke of a pizza out along with my $35 that I paid them and will keep telling everyone how horrible they are to their customers. It's pretty disgusting for a business to treat new time customers like that. They need to learn how to deal with complaints or not have a restaurant at all!"}
{"text":"Let the record show, this is the fastest meal to review transition I've ever done. 

Dante's Pizza reigned supreme for years on Thornhill and Richmond Hill, then some where along the way the owners were forced out by an unnamed corporation and Dante and his brothers swore they'd be back. 

And back they are - literally a stones throw away from the old location. But they're a little hidden so be sure you're on the look out for the Greenpark Homes plaza - they're in there hidden off to the side. 

They're really really new and the location is still working the kinks out in terms of organizing the interior. But the pizza... The pizza is just lovely!!! 

I nabbed a slice and a pop for about $6 taxes in. The slice was super wide, dressed thick with sauce and toppings as Dante and his brothers became known for. The slice was so hot that I've got burnt skin hanging from the roof of my mouth as I write this in the parking lot outside debating whether or not I should go back in for another slice... 

Come here. For the love of pizza. Come here

Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"new favorite pizza joint in vaughan! comparable to abruzzos in my opinion. I've only had delivery, twice in a month which is more than my usual pizza intake haha. I get a medium and its size is comparable to pizza pizzas large at least. price is similar to abruzzos, so on the higher side but you get what you pay for! delivery speed is under an hour and always fresh and delicious! Ive order Italian sausage/green olives/hot peppers/mushrooms and sopressata/hot peppers/bacon, must try :)"}
{"text":"Dantes was our go to pizza place when they were still on Baythorn. Never tried them after their move. Now the original is back.

Still the best pizza in town.  Pricey but definitely worth it as they are very generous with toppings and the crust is amazing.  My custom veggie pizza had huge slices of fresh garlic, and the pitted kalamata olives were whole instead of the usual little slices.  The mini size pizza easily feeds 2 people or one with leftovers for next day.

Hope they offer whole wheat pizza crust soon!"}
{"text":"It's fairly good pizza. I'm not rating it as high as the other reviewers... I never went to the old Dante's, so I have no nostalgia for this place to impact the rating. 

Large size is huge. Easily will feed over 5 people. And there is a generous amount of topping. At just over $30 (for the meat pizza), I thought that it was decent value. 

I didn't like  the crust much though. My main issue was that I ordered \"thin crust\", but it's not thin at all. It may be very slightly thinner than a regular crust. Also, I thought that the taste itself was fairly standard... def not 5 star."}
{"text":"WHAT? ARE YOU JOKING? LoL
I just tried to order, and was told I have been BLACKLISTED by one of the owners, BECAUSE OF MY REVIEW on Yelp. 

UPDATE: if you, like the HangryOne below, doubt my comments, read the other critical reviews for substandard food and the resulting owner rudeness, AND THEN ALSO the owner's replies here on Yelp - because even in this public forum their replies are dripping with sarcasm and thinly veiled contempt. I just choose not to do business with human beings of that sort of character.

My original overly-generous 3-STAR REVIEW ( yes, three stars, it's still archived below) apparently bruised the delicate ego of one of the proprietors, (Apparently because I said a $7.50 delivery charge was too high for what Yelp says is a 9km delivery distance, and despite saying that their pasta was very good), so in a blazing display of Paoletti-style customer service, he told me he decided to never deliver to me again. HAHAHA!

SCORE: Bruised Ego: 1 Customer Service: 0

*Antonino's Pizzeria* (5 Stars on Yelp), Ricci's Pizzeria, Marcello's and even Pizza Break nearby, all have MUCH better pizza, without the WEIRDLY WAXY CHEESE and CRUST THAT IS THICK, WET AND DOUGHY ON TOP, YET TOUGH, HARD AND STIFF AROUND THE EDGES and massively overpriced pizza that one could have delivered by stretch limo for less money, so, cya!

And truly, if you wonder if you should trust my review of the pizza quality, understand that my favorite pizza comes from Danforth Pizza House, go there instead and see if I'm not right. Or order from Abruzzo, they do it MUCH better. :) 

And if you wonder why so many seem to love this pizza if it is really not that great, just remember that Pizza Pizza is the number one selling pizza in Ontario, so the willingness of a bunch of people to say they like it, doesn't necessarily guarantee quality.

If you are tempted to dismiss my review as just one random disgruntled customer, make sure you read several other reviews below of customers who were treated shamefully just because they had the nerve to complain about substandard food. I dare you to call and complain the next time you have a problem, and see how you are treated.

SOOOO, as long as neither quality of food nor reasonable prices are concerns of yours, feel free to call and order, but be careful not to upset the overly sensitive owner(s), lol, smh."}
{"text":"Always solid, great sandwiches and pizza. Expensive for what it is but portions are large enough to share."}
{"text":"Went there earlier this week for my regular pickup that I used to get from across the street. I was not suprisrd nor dissappointed. It a takeout joint with a few little tables that are OK for lunch but I wouldn,t dine there for dinner. The pizza was as usual loaded with plentiful toppings to the point you can't see the cheese. The price was also the same, a little pricey but good for a treat once in a while. Things have not changed with these guys except the location. Feel free to give it a go."}
{"text":"Been having Dantes forever. One of the best pizzas in the city. Ingredients are top notch and fresh. My go to is steak pepperoni and green olives on the pizza. Simply unbeatable 

Note: their sizes are larger than normal. Order a mini for two ppl. It will be plenty."}
{"text":"The sandwich I got tasted good but it was very messy and gave me a little stomach ache after. Overall the food wasn't bad but i would recommend Dantes or Sofra grill across the street. The thing that also disappointed me was the customer service I received by the owner. He for one looks like a slob which gives off a horrible impression as well while I was ordering he with no shame told me to hurry up (the store was completely empty) finally when I ordered a drink I changed my mind last minute and the owner refused to let me swap it for another one worth the same price. I say try it once but if you experience subpar customer service just like me please like this comment or post another so that the owners change! The food is good it sucks to see the place so empty because of the owners customer service"}
{"text":"We ordered the large pizza with double Schneider's pepperoni. We had thin crust and it came piping hot. They make, in my opinion, one of the best pizza's. I've been ordering from them  for years now, they are the original owners of Dante's Pizza on Baythorn in Thornhill. Their prices may be a little pricey, but it's the best ingredients."}
{"text":"Great pizza,  we ordered their veggie pizza with a thin crust. It was loaded with vegetables and had lots of cheese. Really delicious."}
{"text":"A little pricey for delivery but I live in Willowdale, so I understand it's a good distance.  It was Sunday and I was home so I drove myself and man was it worth it.  It reminded me of when they were on Baythorn in Thornhill.  I got a Gnocchi in a vodka sauce added mushrooms, my wife got a veal sandwich.  WOW!  Tasty, tasty.  I need to check out everything on the menu in the next few weeks.  See ya later Dante's, no more business from me."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! Picked up a large pizza, a penne with tomato sauce and a rigatoni with meat sauce for dinner the other night. Humongous portions and tasted amazing! Everyone loved it. Will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service! Ordered the Gnocchi, Spaghetti with meat sauce, and two meatball subs. All of it was amazing. My favorite is the meatball subs with cheese and mushrooms. The service is excellent. You're greeted with a smile and leave with a smile. The prices are fair, the amount of food you get plus the quality really make it worth it. Also, how do you expect people to pay the insane and outrageous fees that come with running a restaurant in Ontario without food being priced high? At least they honor it with amazing flavor and an abundance of food. If you want lower prices, piss off to pizza nova and get yourself a sad a** pie for a jacka** price. You want quality Italian? Well, this is your place."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the Italian Salad and Chicken Sandwich. Found pieces of cardboard in the sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm going to get so fat because this place is too frikin good..... Please bring back the Italian Wedding Soup.... Please!!
Try the beef ravioli with vodka sauce .... Just do it..
Is Dante's across the street still in business????
I think it would be funny if Dante's goes out of biz, and then Paoletti's can take over their lease for cheap!!! Hahaahahahaah"}
{"text":"I come from Thornhill, home of the original Dante's. We were customers for over 17 years while they were on Bay Thorn Drive. Imagine my disappointed when they moved to Vaughan. We ordered a few times even paying the crazy $15 delivery charge to get their super amazing veal sandwiches & pasta to our house in Markham once we moved. As delivery charges rose up, we stopped ordering. Honestly, i didn't give them a second thought until recently when someone mentioned that Dante's closed and the same family opened Paoletti's Pizzeria. I was so excited because just last night, hubby was heading home from work and after a week of craving those amazing veal sandwiches, hubby was 10 min away from Paoletti's! 

Our take-out order was: 1 steak sandwich, 1 veal sandwich and 1 order of Vodka Penne. The veal sandwich - WHAT HAPPENED?!?! Very little veal, bread was very hard & impossible to bite into, hardly any meat (yes, so shocked i said it twice!!!) I was very very disappointed in the portion and quality of bread they now use. The cheese was baked on so much, i couldn't see the veal until splitting the sandwich apart. The portion of meat was 1/4 of what they used to serve in their huge soft bread. Not even their super delish sauce could save this sandwich for me and how tough the bread was. Veal was still as tender as ever, but if they continue to use the same bread, i won't be back unless it's for pizza & pasta to order. Their sandwiches used to be huge - so much meat you could use the bread given with the pasta to make a second sandwich. Certainly not the case anymore.

The only thing that saved the meal for us, was the Vodka Penne - as if time had stood still, still amazing as ever!"}
{"text":"Finally the Dante's recipe!

Paoletti's Pizza was originated from one of the original owners of Dante's Pizza.

Dante Paoletti opened up directly across the street from the original Dante's Restaurant.

The most negative compaint from the original Dante Pizza was the fact that there are just too expensive and over priced for what you get.

Paoletti's comes to rescue with IDENTICAL pizza and Sandwiches at a much reduced price.

Same Recipies, Same original owner...just cheaper!

Good Call!  I hope that many original Dante Pizza Fans will get our Paoletti's Pizza.  You will be impressed!"}
{"text":"Funny thing happen to me the other day .A fellow unit owner at the new mall in Concord told me, that we as unit owners,  were BLACKLISTED from ordering a pizza from PAOLETTI'S  for what ever reason. Not listening I gave it a shot and in 40 minutes the pizza had arrived. The only good thing the pizza had going for it was, it was big. It had a horrible crust, the sauce wasn't great at all and it made me sick. I hope the Guys at the restaurant had a good laugh. Anyways, I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Been wanting to visit for a while, and I've got to say, it was worth the trek!

The pizza here is really good and they use really fresh ingredients. We got two 'small' pizzas for three people, the Deluxe and Mediterranean, and we were completely stuffed. It was so much food. 

Both of the pizzas had tons of really fresh ingredients on them. It shows in both the presentation and taste. The crust was really tasty and crispy at the bottom of the entire pie. Yum. However, I think they were both missing a little *something*.

There are a few tables inside, but most people just seem to do take out. Paoletti's pizzas are super hearty and super filling. Unless you really eat a lot of food, I think their portion recommendations are accurate (as in... ONE small pizza for three people, ha!).

Will definitely be back some time!"}
{"text":"Decent quality pizza and pasta. Not mind blown but still tastes pretty good. Also delivery is under an hour which is good. Prices are a little higher than usual."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant absolutely delicious and worth every penny! My favorite is the steak and cheese sandwich been ordering this sandwich for 25 years and never tire of this"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. The owner is one of the original owners of Dante's Pizza so the food is just as good as Dante's use to be.

Could use a better atmosphere but than again, the food makes up for it all!"}
{"text":"Wow, read a few reviews and was afraid to leave mine because apparently the owner doesn't take well to negative reviews (refer to review my James K). 
There's some long story about how Mr. Paoletti had a part in establishing Dantes and decided to part ways. People missed the original recipe and then Paoletti's opened across the street and solved that problem - regardless of whatever reason they decided to open - I'm a fan of pizza and word of mouth brought me here. 
I came in here ordered a two pizzas. Their crust is crunchier then other pizza places. It's good, but not mind blowing. If you like a crunchy crust, you'll most likely enjoy their pizza very much. It's not thin crust at all - so don't expect that at all when you come here. 
A mini pizza is 12\" and is equivalent to a pizza pizza or dominos small - fit for two people and the other sizes go up by 2\" (14\", 16\" etc.). If you get a signature pizza, it will be jam packed with toppings, I mean A LOT OF TOPPINGS. You will be stuffed if you share a mini with one other person so don't assume it's not enough just because it's called a \"mini\". 
It's above average pizza but their prices are on higher then average, especially since it's a bit out of the way for me. I'd like to note that the gentleman who took our order was very friendly/pleasant and definitely added a very homely feeling to the place, which is nice."}
{"text":"pizza is always fresh. The sauce used is delicious. I like the flavour and its always made fresh once you order. you wait 4min or so but its good cause you know your not getting a stale slice."}
{"text":"clean interior
red, green, wooden all around
inviting, i'd say

a delicious slice
baked to a crunchy state. nice!
crisp pepperoni

but over five bucks?
no thanks. won't be coming back.
i'm disappointed

i'm tempted to click
the four dollar signs button
to rep' the value"}
{"text":"Having been a fan of the original Dante's, I was excited to finally try Paoletti's.

We did takeout and I was not disappointed. We ordered Caesar salads, garlic bread, veal parmesan with side veggies, penne with tomato sauce, side of meatballs. It came with a bunch of fresh ciabatta buns as well.

The food was fresh, the pasta was cooked to perfection. There was minimal grease left in the containers, the veggies had a nice crunch to them. We were really happy and I am eager to order from them again."}
{"text":"Paoletti's Pizzeria brings back the old Dante's flavour.
Dante's Pizza had been my favourite italian restaurant basically as long as I can remember, but since the move and especially since they ousted Dante himself, it has gone way downhill. The last time I ordered pasta there, it tasted like something you'd get in a food court: bland and uninspired. So I was so happy to hear that the original owner of Dante's was opening his own place again, and even happier when I tried the food.
 It's all about the sauces at Paoletti's. My favourite is the penne with vodka sauce but it's all delicious. I like that you can build your own pastas and pizzas, and that every meal comes with a nice little loaf of bread. I was a little sad they didn't bring back the cannelloni from the old menu, which I loved, but there are plenty other options available. 
Only had delivery so far, so can't say anything about the premises, but looking forward to going and checking it out."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for friendly, or maybe in this case not-so-friendly, competition. As a long time purveyor of the original Baythorn Dante's, it became obvious that something had gone incredibly wrong upon visiting the new location on Dufferin. I was directed to the Star for the low-down on what happened to the original and I would suggest anyone interested refer to same. Enough of that for the meantime, now to the food.

The brothers are back and better than ever. Either that, or I've just been craving this particular pie for just too long. That should be nuff said right there for anyone in the know. For those not, the pizza here is crispy, topped with zesty sauce, springy cheese, and only the very best toppings which simply eclipse the base. Definitely worth going out of your way for.
Counters at the front of the shop proudly display what can only be rightfully described as beautiful produce and staff from the back is frequently visiting the front for ingredients. It seems that the place might be too small for its use, but that adds to the neighbourhood charm, much needed in the industrial park in which the location is situated and clearly different from that over-the-top place across the road."}
{"text":"Recently got takeout from these guys.  The pizza was really good, way better than any of the franchise stuff.  It is mainly a takeout place so don't really expect to sit in and be serviced. It's a bit on the pricier side relative to other pizza alternatives but you can immediately tell you are paying for quality.  Generous with toppings and cheese I was full after two slices.  I would definitely consider a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I had delivery.  The pizza was average, but at least they are generous with the toppings.  However the garlic bread was very tough.  I think it had been reheated at least twice in a microwave oven.  Very expensive relative to the competition,($40 incl tip vs $25) and slow delivery.  To be fair, I knew the price when I ordered it, and the person on the phone told me how long it would be.  For the high price and slow delivery I expected more."}
{"text":"still consistent reliable and deliciousnow they are five plus because they are as they were 
dantes 
fine food 
pizza is the start 
and then there is alot  more 
amazing  hot sandwiches 
pastas 
salads 
fresh savoury delicious !!!


if they decide to expand in one other food area 
i may have to order all my meals from them"}
{"text":"Paoletti's Pizza is owned and operated by the family who ran the ORIGINAL Dante's Pizza located on Baythorn Drive in Thornhill. Up until early last year, the Paoletti brothers were working in the kitchen of the similarly named but non-family owned Dante's Pizza and Vino on Dufferin north of Highway 7. For reasons that are not known, the Paoletti family parted ways with the corporately owned store bearing the original name. Rather than letting their loyal and longtime customers to the competition, the brothers decided they would start a new business serving up their famous pizza and pasta almost directly across the street of their namesake. If you enjoyed the original Dante's or the food at the new location prior to mid-2014, you're going to love Paoletti's Pizza. Unfortunately they only do take-out and delivery at this time."}
{"text":"Ordered here for the first time for pickup. We got a thin-crust, mushroom, green pepper, half-pepperoni-half-chicken pizza. The toppings were plentiful and very fresh. The thick-cut pepperoni was way tastier than any other pizza chains. We like our crust crispy so asked for it well-done. It was perfect. The price is a tad steeper than other places but you get what you pay for. We'll definitely come back to try other pizzas."}
{"text":"First time here.  Very impressed.

Heard all the rumbling about the pizza politics \"politizza. \"

We usually order from Antonino's however they don't deliver and when busy, they kinda suck.  

We ordered a full veggie pizza (lots of pepperoni pictures here).  Green onions, mushrooms and olives.  A classic in this household.  

The size of the pizza did not disappoint.  It was huge and heavy!  Toppings were plentiful and tasty and the sauce was perfect. 

The only downside was the onions.  Usually when they are used as a topping, they're somewhat cooked.  They were more or less raw tonight.  Since there was a lot of them (a positive!), took a while to pull them off. Oh well. I'll live. 


The dough was crispy on the outside yet soft and fluffy on the inside.  Like a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes (RIP James Avery). 


I will definitely be a repeat customer and you should too."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try a pizza from Paoletti's for quite some time and finally ceased the opportunity last night for Boyz Night with my son, and we weren't disappointed! We ordered a large pie with the traditional tomato sauce, pepperoni and half mushrooms - it was seriously delicious. It was just the two of us, so there was plenty. The size could have easily fed a family of four. Nice large sized slices and they weren't shy on toppings. Of course we also ordered some wings (they offer one style - baked versus fried medium/hot Buffalo), and they were a very tasty addition to our night after hard week of work and first week back at school. We'll be ordering again from Paoletti's - definitely two thumbs up for Boyz Night. Great local pizzeria (and much more) that left us feeling completely content! We're gonna tackle our leftover slices for lunch today....maybe breakfast. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin?  The friendly service or the amazing food.... or that I will now need to attend eggplant rehab!

Went with my daughter and her friend and we ordered way more food than 3 ppl can eat...which garnered a few looks of disbelief from other customers lol

Everything was fresh, ooey-gooey with cheese that never stopped stretching and teasing us!!

We started with:

Mini Pepperoni Pizza
Meatball \"Sangwich\"
Two orders Spagetti with Meatsauce
Penne ala Vodka
Eggplant Parmesan 
3 large panini came with it  (fresh)

Then we ordered another Penne & Eggplant 
To take home and enjoy for the rest of the week!!

These guys put the new owners of Dante's to shame, and are so far above them - that it wouldn't be fair to compare the two.


Special plea to the Paolettie family...please adopt me!!
Sighhh can't wait for lunch tmo..."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon, so there wasn't much in terms of a crowd.  We ordered our pizza and about 15 minutes later, it was ready for us to consume.  There were 3 tables there, so we figured we might as well stay there and eat while the pizza was nice and fresh.  We ordered a super deluxe pizza, but I can't remember if we ordered a mini or a small.  Looking at the picture doesn't really help me remember.  The pizza came topped with a very generous amount of pepperoni, mushroom, onion, salami, red peppers, and tomato.  I wish there was a bit more colour to the pizza, it was just all so red.  Everything was very fresh!  The downside, it was a bit salty for me (may be due to all the meat), and also, I wasn't a huge fan of the crust.  I like a chewier crust, this was a bit more bready.  I love to eat pizza, but i'm not too familiar with the different kinds of crust and what regions they are from."}
{"text":"Walk in Special for a slice of either Pepperoni or Vegetarian Pizza ($4.99) and $1 extra for a pop.

I highly suggest to come in during busy hours or just order a whole pizza baked fresh. My slice has rubbery cheese instead of gooey ooey and the pizza bottom was hard. Luckily the pop selection was really good and I really enjoyed my San Pellegrino Aranciata Rossa (Blood Orange Soda).

Service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta. Been looking for a place like this for awhile. I placed a take out order tonight. When I called, I was answered by a very nice lady. Super polite and very easy to understand. We ordered penne with tomato sauce, penne with meat sauce, gnocchi, rapini and a Caesar salad. Everything was amazing. Portions were huge, will need to scale back a bit on my next order. Will be making this our regular stop! Pizza is next."}
{"text":"Real authentic pizza, I thought it was pricey at first but it is worth the price, you will not be disappointed."}
