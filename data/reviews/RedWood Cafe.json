{"text":"Tried the Cuban and a side of Mac. The sandwich was a little pricey but well worth the price. Serving it on a baguette was a great choice to hold in all the delicious flavor of the pulled pork which is cooked perfectly. The Mac was awesome, a perfect touch of smoke to the Gouda makes it a unique macaroni experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just got done having one of the best fine dining meals I have ever had!    The fried Brussel sprouts with the balsamic reduction were incredible.  The asparagus risotto was so delicious with the fresh lemon scent & a taste of lemon with perfectly grilled asparagus.   Then came the panko crusted lobster tail with a wonderful sauce & roasted leeks.   Just when you think nothing could top what you've had so far you're served the tenderloin.   It was so tender it melted in your mouth.   The pur√©ed sweet potatoes served with it were perfect.   For dessert there was an almond cake with chocolate ganache, fresh berries  & homemade whipped cream.   Kudos to Frank & Brian for a delicious, memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service in the heart of Mount Lebanon. We had lunch there my buddies have in the Cuban and myself having the meatball hoagie both of which were very very good they make a loaded potato salad which was amazing all in all a great experience I would recommend going if you're looking for a great sandwich"}
{"text":"I think RedWood Cafe was relatively new when I stopped in. The space is very small with just a few seats at the counter and a few tables in the back, so I would say it's mostly a takeout place. The menu consists of soups, sandwiches, and salads, making it a great place for lunch.   I ordered the Simple Burger, which came with a side of potato salad and a pickle. The burger was exactly what the name suggests, simple, and that's exactly what I was looking for. The owner came by and offered a sample of his homemade macarons and they alone are worth a visit to RedWood Cafe.   If you're looking for something quick and simple in Mt. Lebo, RedWood is the place to go."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating here for a quick lunch. The sandwiches were good and the potato side is also great. The Cuban had a kick but not too spicy. We like their breakfast options as well."}
{"text":"This is a small sandwich shop that has a nice selection of sandwiches, some of which are distinctive and unique. It's not your typical deli where you go for turkey, roast beef or ham sandwiches. I had a Cuban sandwich that was very tasty. It was a pressed sandwich, heated and served on a baguette. Everything tasted very fresh. It looked a little small but because it was pressed there was more there than met the eye.   The have burgers and sandwiches like that that are cooked, and a real interesting vegetarian option with grilled eggplant.   All the sandwiches come with a home made potato salad. They get extra points for the potato salad, which was fresh and not too sweet or creamy.   When you go in, there's a counter with about six seats and the sandwiches a we marode behind the counter. It looked like there was an additional seating area in the back, but I didn't go there so don't know how large it was.   Prices were maybe a little high at $11 for the Cuban sandwich, but I think with the quality it was worth it."}
{"text":"Dear Lord, what an unexpected treasure this place is! It's basically a tiny gourmet lunch counter with a few tables in the back. Exactly the kind of place where you stop in for a bite to eat before dashing off to your next meeting. But what a bite!  The Redwood Cafe cultivates a high level of cuisine - almost everything on the menu is made fresh, and everything is bright and clean. I had their soup du jour, which was cream of mushroom, and it was thick and chock full of pureed mushrooms. I practically melted into my seat while eating it.   For my main dish I had their ever-popular crab cake sandwich, and it was just fabulous! It was one of the best crab cakes I've ever eaten, and the lemon aoili sauce was absolutely divine.  The price was very fair at about $13 for the meal and I was in and out in just 15 minutes - about half the time it would have taken me if I'd sat down in one of the full-service restaurants across the street. But I got the same quality food as I'd  expect in a full-size restaurant. I was sitting there talking directly to the chef and enjoyed seeing them cutting up the mushrooms and continuing to cook while I ate.  If this level of quality continues I can't see the chef staying in this hole-in-the-wall space for more than a few years - Redwood Cafe is destined for great things one day. Come grab a bite while they are still small and I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Uptown!! We stopped in for lunch.. had a burger and Mac and cheese. Both were really good! And they guys working were so nice and welcoming. All of the menu items looked great and we will definitely be back! It's BYOB so that's good to know. It's worth a stop for sure."}
{"text":"Salad was filled with delicious veggies, balsamic dressing was delicious. Meatball hoagie was tasty and alittle spicy. My chief complaint is why do they serve coffee in a styrofoam cup?? And why do they serve a soda in the can?? Too many dishes to wash?? We ate at the counter and would have preferred a glass and a cup!"}
{"text":"My oldest son was buying a house through Howard Hannah. One of their main offices is across the street from Redwood Cafe. Several of the real estate agents recommended trying Redwood Cafe. The day my son closed on his first house we went for breakfast. There are no tables, just a bar counter with stools. We each ordered something different. I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. We watched the chef not only make our food but watched as they prepped food for the whole day. It wasn't long before our meals were served. My eggs were fluffy. The Bacon was cooked just the way I liked it. The toast was a little crispy but a smidge soft. Simple but delicious. We each ate our whole meals. We will definitely go back and try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and excellent presentation in addition to reasonable prices. This location lacks decent seating and the food is pretty middle of the road by Pittsburgh standards."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a snack- had the Mac n cheese -- wuz goood!   Looks like a nice sandwich menu, and cool bar style seating.  Awesome fact- they use REAL ovens and stovetop to heat/cook!!  Love it."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Good Sandwiches and good soup and friendly people!  Have stopped in a couple more times and have had great sandwiches.  The Cuban is delicious, it had dijon, swiss, capital and pork on a baguette and came with a pickle.   Also, had the crab sandwich again because it is so good.  The side of home made potato said is terrific,  some small redskins, cheese, chive and small pieces of cured ham.  Now that is cooler I had the Clam Chowder on my last visit.  Very good soup. The RedWood is hard to beat for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Only have eaten here once.  It was just OK.  I was expecting it to be better then a standard sandwich place but while the menu has some interesting options the quality is that of a standard sandwich shop.  If you just want a quick bite it's fine, but don't expect anything more."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. Everything is excellently prepared and very high quality. The crab cake has outstanding flavor. Probably one of the best Ive ever had. The salads are good too, always very fresh. Love to add the shredded pork on them. The gentleman that run the place are very welcoming. A very nice addition to the many great restaurants here in Mt Lebo."}
