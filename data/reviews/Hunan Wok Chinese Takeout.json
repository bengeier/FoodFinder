{"text":"Had Hunan Wok yesterday because it was on my way home. I've heard mixed reviews so I wanted to try it for myself. I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps, combos, sides, and entrees.   I got their General Tso's Chicken (extra spicy) and because my order was a take-out over $12, they threw in two free egg rolls. #win   (Other offers are Free 1 Small Fried Rice w/purchase of $16, Free General Tso's or Sesame Chicken w/purchase over $28)    I called on my way there and it took about 10-15 .... When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win  Just like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good.  The meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer.   The egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.    I will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving.   Everyone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion.   Side note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval."}
{"text":"Middle of the road as far as take-out, strip-mall Chinese food goes.  Their egg rolls are horrible - no wonder they are practically giving them away.  I enjoyed my lo mein and cashew chicken, however.  Staff is friendly.  Visible parts of the kitchen appear clean.  Food was ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"In a city filled with greasy entree after greasy entree one restaurant stands out (sort of)  I love Hunan Wok's sweet and sour chicken, because it's not too greasy and the portions are great. Also they're one of the few places I can use a credit card under $10.00!"}
{"text":"This a very modest family-operated Chinese food take-out place. BUT, they also make several unexpected dishes that are not on the printed menu. They are handwritten on signs inside on the wall. Good stuff. I frequently order their chicken wings, large whole wings made to order. And the cheese wonton comes with a side of warm sweet& sour sauce for dipping. Yum! They are very friendly and prepare orders quickly. They will also accommodate special requests such as no mushrooms or extra spicy, etc."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times due to working in the area. Hunan Wok is okay, but nothing to brag home about either. The General Tso is often dry, but the portion size is pretty large. I've also had the chicken and broccoli which is pretty decent. I'd say this is your typical Chinese food. It's not bad, but not awesome either."}
{"text":"Everything is always excellent and my order is always correct. Never ever have to worry about bad food from this place it's very good and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried Shrimp & Beef with Chinese veg this time. The brown sauce was mediocre. I like their white sauce better. will try garlic sauce next time."}
{"text":"Heyyyy everyone. Im gonna try to start up on these again! So im new around this side of town and thought i'd try the Chinese restaurant around the corner. I call in and order small general tso's with white rice . The menu i see online tells me 7.54 she says on the phone that its 8.25(assuming thats the tax) or something like that Then tells me it will take 10mins i get there in 6 mins and its already done . So i know its not fresh. Then i go to pay and she says 9.58. Which is annoying. But after that long rant the food wasnt on the fresher side, it looked very dry, BUT it was has a really good flavor! it isnt spicy at all if thats what youre looking for and idk if they dont do sizes  but if this is a small good Lord idk what the large would look like. Im adding pics. Flash no flash and UPDATED menu."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place because it's super super cheap and the food is edible. My husband and I always eat for about $13. It's nothing fancy but does the trick for cheap Chinese. I usually stick with the chicken fried rice and crab Rangoon. And they always throw in a couple egg rolls for us."}
{"text":"I live closeby so I've been there dozens of times. I usually get chicken with broccoli or moo goo gai pan. My sister Vi usually gets moo shoo pork. The food is excellent American Chinese cuisine. The broccoli is always cooked perfectly, it is nice and bright green and firm yet not tough to chew. The chicken breast is always light and lean. Love the garlic white sauce used on the moo goo gai pan. Vi loves the plum sauce. There are several Chinese restaurants in Carrick and Mt. Oliver and I'd rate this one the best. I wish the broth used in the wonton soup was a bit richer and the egg rolls would be better if they were lighter."}
{"text":"It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the Hawaii Five O dish I had was ok too. The service is a little slow as well."}
{"text":"This place is HORRENDOUS! Yuck yuck yuck!!! It's filthy! Roach infested! The food is DISGUSTING!!!The owners are rude!  I truly do not know how they stay in business! If you want DELICIOUS Chinese take- out,order from Wang's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great coupons, good prices, and yummy food just not much of a selection compared to other local restaurants AND they don't deliver.   That said, the low mein is decent and the beef and mushrooms is excellent. The free general tsos is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I have had in a long time. The Crab Rangoon was clunky and too thick. There was no crab on the inside-it was all cream cheese. The egg roll I had was dripping grease and was filled with cabbage and nothing else. There were no other veggies or anything. The Sesame Chicken was mushy by the time I got home and I live 5 minutes away. It was all mushy breading and very little chicken. I ate 3 bites and threw it away. This meal was an EPIC FAIL."}
{"text":"Dragon Meet Phoenix,(a bad-ass name for a dish if there ever was one, it conjures images of Toho monster flicks), 3 egg rolls, an order of fried dumplings, and Hawaii Five-O certainly made our evening labor-free.   Which one was the dragon and which one was the phoenix, I'm not sure of, but this was a mash-up of tempura shrimp and General Tso's Chicken that worked rich, meaty, syrupy magic o'er top some flawless white rice.   The dumpings were quintessentially filling, sticky, packed with ground pork, yet missed something unnameable that dumplings from other restaurants have in spades.   The egg rolls were a bit boring and possessed little in the way of sapor.   Sorry for the brief review, but there ain't much to write about here other than it is hidden in yet another shopping center. Non-descript is the word of the evening.   P.S. There is no dine-in."}
