{"text":"I had one sub-par meal there, the meat was not very flavorful, the tortilla nothing near authentic.  Tried it again just to be sure, and the second time it was again sup-par.    There is definitely better Mexican food to be had in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area."}
{"text":"So tonight was the first time trying to eat here. Trying being the key word. Got in line. Ordered 1 beef taco and one beef enchilada and sat down with our party. The guys in our party that came after us and ordered some time after us got their food before me. I saw at least 15 people get their food before my friend and myself (we ordered at the same time 2 different orders). So I went up and asked for a refund.  They looked at my recipe and said oh yours is coming up soon. So I said soon was 20 people ago. I want a refund.  well my friend was still waiting on his food, his order was before mine.... He waited another 3-4 minutes before his food came."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years.  Great red chile and green chile and outstanding fish tacos. I have one complaint. When I come inside to dine, I receive complimentary chips and hot sauce. But, when I go through the drive through,  chips cost extra. Why??? The answer they gave me was that getting free chips is my reward for \"joining them inside for a meal\". So, I am punished because I didn't eat inside? Ridiculous. Chips and salsa is pretty standard at all Mexican food restaurants in the Valley.  Don't nickel and dime someone because the took their food to go. Still a paying customer. Please fix this policy."}
{"text":"I have been going to SomeBurros since I was a kid and the food has been very good and have been eating at Someburros for years."}
{"text":"Excellent food at an excellent price with excellent service. Our family loves SomeBurros, especially for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and very reasonably priced!  The service is almost always good and fast, and the outdoor patio is nice when the weather cooperates.  Everything we've gotten there is good, but I'm partial to the beef and bean burro- it's on the way out from the Kiwanis Rec Center and nothing is better after a hard workout!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the various Somburros locations for many years.  My go-to items are the shredded chicken tacos and the shredded beef burro.  The tacos are a great deal on Tuesdays for $2 a taco and the burros are reasonably priced as well.  The chips and salsa are free and they'll give you more if you ask.  Tip: smother everything in the somewhat spicy salsa."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer here and Mill for about 25 years.  Never has let me down.  Fantastic green chili!  Best shredded burros around.  And the pollo fundito is as great to eat as it is to say.  leaps above fast food,  Eat in, or call it in and pick it up at the drive through."}
{"text":"Went in today, Saturday, and the place was definitely not crowded. I was the only person in line and ordered 4 meals............ After waiting for 15 minutes, I went to the counter and asked what had happened to our order.  The person working there said they hadnt even started it yet.  I did speak to the manager and was refunded my money, and I went on my way with my children.  The manager was not apologetic, nor cared that we walked away.  We will never be back to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Best bean burro in town for me, love it with guacamole."}
{"text":"Not bad!  We stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago.  My hubby had eaten here before so he showed me the ropes, so to speak.  They have a large menu and it can be quite overwhelming, especially if you go during lunch and everyone else seems to know what they want.  If you have to stare at the menu for a while, it's best to step aside or you will be trampled.  Not knowing what I was doing, the employees were quick to suggest things and very helpful and patient.  The food was good, but a little bland.  Spice it up a little people!  It's a Mexican food restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here this afternoon! Many options! I ordered breakfast, my husband had a chicken burrito specialty and my daughter had the ninos bean burrito combo. We all enjoyed our lunch. The restaurant was clean and the meals were served quickly!"}
{"text":"I worked in the same plaza as the one on Mill and used to frequent it for lunch (and enjoyed it) so when I discovered they opened one up close by, I was stoked.  My ''go to'' at the Tempe location had always been the Pollo Fundido...not ''authentic'' mexican food by any standard, but it was always a chickeny, cheesy, gooey flavor bonanza that I enjoyed thoroughly.  Feeling nostalgic, I went ahead and ordered one.  Renata K mentioned that the chicken was ''watery''...she was right.  I  cut the guy in half and a bunch of liquid came pouring out.  Of course that immediately turned me off because not only was it gross in general, it started sogging up my Fundito (it's deep fried...basically a chimi)  That watery chicken had no flavor at all...basically a very tasty shell with very tasy Fundido sauce filled with chicken textured nothingness.  Might have been an off day...since I've had the Rod Burro and the green chili burro and they have been good...afraid to order the Pollo Fundido again but a friend did once while we were there and looked like the same issue (he's not picky AT ALL so he said it was good).  2 things that I always liked a lot at Someburros: the rice and the hot sauce, were both still awesome at this location...just won't be ordering my ''go to'' there....sadly."}
{"text":"Pretty pedestrian Mexican food. The tacos and taquitas are fried and greasy, but I like them anyway. Also, the restaurant is bright and busy at lunchtimes, and the staff seem friendly. However, the other reviewers are right ~ the salsa is boring. There are better Mexican food restaurants, but Someburros! is a good place to get a quick lunch bite."}
{"text":"Good food but questionable practices concerning claims of gluten free.  Our son cannot eat gluten and we went to Someburros for dinner.  Many items are labeled as gluten free on their menu which is problematic as they informed us that these items contain no gluten ingredients but many are cooked in the same fryer as items that contain gluten.  Anyone who has a gluten sensitivity knows that restaurants need a dedicated fryer to not cross -contaminate the food.  Seems that Someburros should not make this claim on their menu unless their kitchen is prepared to actually uphold good gluten free standards.  Luckily the staff seemed knowledgable and told us that many of the items were cooked in this manner.  We headed to the In-n-Out Burger next door that has the gluten free process down."}
{"text":"Well I am amazed that this place can be called \"Great Mexican Food\". Where does the \"Great Mexican Food\" term come from? I have been to a couple of locations thinking that the food might get better at a different location, well let me tell you my experience was not any better at any of their locations. I have never had such bland Mexican food until I have been to this place.   The sour cream has to be the fake watered down version that you get at a rehab or prison. Not that I have been t prison but I can assure you that this is the cheap version of sour cream.  Let's talk about their hot sauce or salsa; on wait they have no salsa its tomato sauce with no flavor or kick to it. Once again water is cheap and this must be watered down as well because this is pitiful sauce. It tastes like something that comes out of a box that's been regenerated over and over again.   The chips, are you serious? I know chips are a freebie but why serve chips that's been sitting for days or weeks. Nasty  Should we talk about their beef / chicken? Let's keep this short or to the point, its Institutional food and it has no flavor to it.   Well I gave it a try several times and at several locations and I must say this is a big disappointment and I will stick to my other favorites and not spend another hard earned dollar in this cheap establishment."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!! Been going here for 15+ years and still love it! Green sauce on everything is my favorite. Delicious, great quality chicken! Recently discovered the quesadilla with green chile strips in it and OMG- amazing! Great dine in experience or super convenient take out with a drive thru window. Now serving breakfast too- go for the senor jorge or verde scramble..."}
{"text":"I think I've been to all five locations. Love the tacos, but my favorite is the Pollo Fundido. The chips to start are great and did you know if you put the salsa bottle down to fast it'll shoot salsa straight up in the air? Try it."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and heard good things about this place...but my husband and I thought it was horrible.  I hate giving such a bad review, but blah.  Maybe we went on an off day.  We ended up throwing our food away, and I am probably the least pickiest person when it comes to food.  The chicken meat tasted like canned tuna.  The only good part was the tortilla chips, which are hard to mess up.  We left and went to in and out burger next door for lunch instead."}
{"text":"Great local place that has a flavorful, solid menu, and an attentive staff. I go here once a week and get either a chorizo cheese crisp, beef enchiladas, or a chimichanga. They're always busy and they're the best casual Mexican food in the Valley."}
{"text":"1st trip there a few months ago I was very disappointed.  Food was cold, order was wrong and while leaving I just had a feeling I got jobed and the crew had messed up.  Tried it again today because recommendations were so good.  I must say, service was very good, food was fantastic and the order was correct this time..hah..very reasonable prices and food is cooked fresh.  I/we will be going back again for sure.  I must say there tacos are a bit on the skimpy side but very tasty.  The pollo fundido is fantastic."}
{"text":"Have always driven past but never eaten here until today!! Pleasantly surprised, the warm chips and salsa is addicting, staff are friendly, food was very good, specially the pollo fundido is worth getting and a very good size, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great quick Mexican food. The customer services is always friendly and quick. I order the number 3 (3 mini chimes with rice and beans) almost every time we come here. You get your own side of chips with each meal you order. The prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Someburros food is quite flavorless, to the extent it doesn't seem possible. The pollo fundido simply tasted like a bland fried tortilla with chicken that had the right texture, but no taste to speak of.  It is really a miracle that they could made such boring mexican fare. Even the hot sauce, which had the right color and a tad bit of heat, lacked evidence of taste that it may have come from chili pepper.  The one redeeming feature of this place is the staff was very pleasant. But the food certainly is not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Love the Mexican food here. I come here once or twice a week and I'm never disappointed by the food or the customer service. Free refills on chips and the hot sauce has excellent flavor. The carney asada is my favorite dish at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Someburros, although I have to admit I always order the same thing (combo #1.) The chips and salsa are fantastic. If you like it hot order the salsa verde sometime.   Combo #1 includes: cheese enchilada, taco (choice of chicken or shredded beef), and beans. I like to smother the whole plate in Someburros red salsa and then dig in! Everything tastes fresh and comforting.   The restaurant on Baseline and Mill is my favorite, but it's small and can get crowded. The place is always neat, clean and friendly. It's not a fast food joint, nor is it fancy dining--somewhere in between.  One last note: you probably won't see it on the menu but they do serve bottled beer."}
{"text":"Love their food. We eat here way to often. Very authentic food. Atmosphere is great. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"It's the hot sauce.  I never drown any food in a sauce, juice, gravy, or condiment but I will drink Someburro's hot sauce all by itself. 1995 may have been the first time I visited here and the hot sauce has always been mild-medium in heat but packs a ton of chili-ness flavor and seasonings. So everything on the menu is just a delivery source. Some better than others.  The tacos are fried in what I call an 'upgraded' preformed shell. Much better than anything store bought and from any typical Mexican Fast Food joint. The tasty, well-seasoned shredded beef is fried along with the shell and there isn't an overwhelming amount of lettuce and tomato. There could be more cheese however. The somewhat-bland chicken version comes almost minced like the crab meat in a sushi roll.  The burros are above medium sized (although I haven't had the Pollo Fundido, those are big) and aren't double-folded. The red chili has very tender beef cubes and lots of flavor but almost mild in heat. The shredded beef is very good just as they are in the tacos. The carne asada burro has beans and potato in it - not my favorite version.  There's free drink refills and complimentary chips that are somewhere between really good restaurant-style chips and store bought. The outside seating is great when it's cooler out otherwise the concrete chairs can be used to re-heat your food. Don't feed the birds. The drive-thru is for call-in orders only. Seating inside is a little cramped. Tell the friendly folks at the front counter if you're in a group - they'll keep all of the orders in one number and bring it all out at once."}
{"text":"Came here for $2 taco Tuesday. I ordered chicken and carne asada tacos. Turns out the carne asada taco is not part if the deal, bummer! All of the tacos were good. The hot sauce was spicier than usual which is a good thing in my book."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, it wasn't the greatest.. I went to a different location years ago and thought it was really good, so came to this one and the food is not the greatest, but not bad either.    The place was pretty clean so that was a bonus.  I just didn't like the attitude of the girl who took the order... but what can you expect from teenagers, really?  Probably won't be back in anytime soon but will always give something a second chance."}
{"text":"This place has amazing chicken flautas. I love, love, love them. The rice is especialy flavorful. It's nice that you can sit down in a casual environment but they still bring the food to you...the serve complimentary chips and hot sauce, but their \"veggie\" salsa--really just regular salsa is delicious instead but you have to pay for it. The guacamole is just okay...it's pretty much just the mashed avacado with nothing else in it. Very reasonably priced. If I could make one suggestion it would be to include all white meat or at least offer it as an option. The meat in the pollo fundido is kind of iffy."}
{"text":"Anytime I travel out of AZ for work, my husband knows to have a Three Way burro ordered and ready to be picked up on our way back home from the airport.  It is my comfort food, for sure.  My company also uses them for catering and their platters are pretty awesome if you're looking for that sort of thing.  They always send plenty of chips and salsa too.  We've never had an issue with them failing to arrive on time or failing to provide what was ordered.  This location is great and accessible right off Mill Ave and Baseline.  I have only dined in a couple of times, the rest of my experiences have been with phone/web orders and the pick up window.    Ordering online is SO easy!  I love it when I don't have to call a place and deal with background noise when placing my order.    The restaurant is clean and all the staff have been very friendly.  The drive through staff is amazing.  They always double check the order to make sure you're getting what you ordered and are sure to include extra hot sauce.  I LOVE their chips and hot sauce.  Another reviewer said it is ketchup based.  WHAT?  No.  Honey.  Just no.  The salsa is your usual watery pico de gallo type salsa, whereas the hot sauce is all ground chilis, tomato and garlic yumminess.  I will eat it until my tongue is trying to escape the inferno of my mouth and my nose is running.  It's that good.    My favorites are the Three Way Burro enchilada style with green sauce, or Three Way Chimichanga, if I feel like blowing my calorie allowance for the next three days.  I've also had the Rod Burro which was good, the pollo fundido, and their tacos.  Tacos are pretty basic, nothing special, standard tacos.  Get the shredded beef, they are tasty if they are hot.  Their rice and beans are also good, but it is hard to mess that up.    Give them a try, for the price, the ease, and the convenience, your money is better spent here than at Fili-Bs, Taco Bell, or any of the other Berto's chains."}
{"text":"Not bad!  The menu was really confusing, really jumping out at you with all the whimsical but poorly contrasting 80s colors, barrage of small text, and disorganized. Staff at the counter tried to be helpful but seemed like to do so wasnt efficient use of their time. Better to first grab menu, figure out what you want, AND THEN, go into the line. Otherwise, it will be a high pressure line.  It was nice they brought the food out. But you have to be sure to get your own untensils and stuff. The chairs/tables are too tight and clumped together. While seating was open air, it was like trying to squeeze your way down the aisle on a jetplane.   Decoration was nice though and the place had a good atmosphere.  The food was not bad, but not great. Gotta chicken chimichanga, drenched in sauce I thought seemed cheap. The refried beans were bland, like right from a can at the dollar store, but wasnt bad. The spanish rice was excellent and the chicken was a good portion. Next time, id just get it without the sauce.  The taco we had was awsome. Just like how my family used to make them growing up! Very awesome. The chips were really good. Instead of salsa, it was more of a taco sauce they give to you in a squeeze bottle. It was really good and tasty.  Thats about it. They have a big, diverse menu. I hear some people like them, others dont. Seemed to have a good crowd that appeared to be regulars when I was there.  So I recommend giving them a try yourself.  But heed my suggestion to grab a menu first to review before jumping into line. Will go smoother."}
{"text":"My fiance and I always come to this location and get the same thing every time....the mouth-watering Pollo Fundido. Its just absolutely delicious! When both of us don't feel like cooking and we want something quick, yummy, and inexpensive this is where we go! But beware the Pollo Fundido is quite addicting! :)"}
{"text":"Best green chili on the market. I want to be buried alive in Someburro's green chili."}
{"text":"So disappointed and frustrated! I ordered a fiesta platter a day before my party and scheduled for a 3 o'clock pick up. Went there to pick up my platter at 3 o'clock and they didn't have it even started."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing customer experience!!!. I had ordered food through the online service for myself and 2 co-workers. I went and picked up our food through the drive up window. When I got back to the office we realized we were missing 2 tacos. I called in and let the manager know. They said I could come and pick up my tacos. I explained that I could not leave work so I asked if they could deliver them to my office. They asked me to hold and came back on and asked for my address. I gave it to them and within 10 minutes they were at my office 3 miles down the street. WOW now that is exceptional customer service. They even gave me some churros for the inconvenience. If i could I would give 10 stars. Thank you so much for the obove and beyond service you provided. This type of service seems to not exist these days."}
{"text":"It tasted like every other mexican food joint. Nothing special. The guy at this location had an attitude because I couldn't figure out what I want. Turns out, all of it tastes kinda bland. The rice and beans were bland, the burros were ok. Once again, nothin special."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and authentic! The margaritas are worth using a gift card. The customer service finishes the deal! Great f-ing place"}
{"text":"I love Someburros!!  I'm obsessed with their bean & cheese burrito... Their tomatillo sauce... And the crudo burro!  Yummm!  Get extra hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. Chips today were really gross. I think the oil was old. Thick tortillas. Large portions, kinda bland. White people Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love Someburros! They have my favorite salsa in the world! All the workers are extremely friendly and the service has been great. My family and I have been going for years. It is a nice family owned restaurant and you can't go wrong with one of their burritos!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is finally a good Mexican Food place here in Scottsdale with real Mexican food. If you're in the mood for a good meal that does not take a toll on your wallet try Someburros. Far better than Ajo Al's by leaps and bounds."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Someburros! I'm a big fan of Julio's Too, but don't always want to make the trek over to Oldtown. I know a good shredded beef taco, and these are some of the best. Rice and beans are great too. The homemade salsa is delicious and the chips are thin and crispy. The food is top notch and the service is great -- everyone is friendly and helpful. Cute outdoor seating area too!"}
{"text":"Big sign saying gluten free, but when asked they have no idea what this means. Fryers are shared with flour and corn and so is everything else. They are obviously trying to jump on the GF bandwagon without regard to who gets sick.   Oh well, back to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food is disgusting. The Mexican Pizza looked like they dumped a can of Alpo on a tortilla. The breakfast burrito - welI let's just say I couldn't find the egg in the pile of crap they put on the plate but in all fairness it was probably there when they made it, it just disintegrated from all the grease.  Four meals and not one of us could muster up so much as an enthusiastic \"It's mediocre!\" It was just awful plain & simple.  I usually try to give a first bad review a second chance but I don't think I could stomach my way through this disaster again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new mexican fast food place in south Tempe and regret the choice.  Subtly rude service, and the food was worse.  Ordered the cheese-crisp (quesadilla) and it was soggy, torn, and looked repulsing.  Not to mention it was lacking cheese.  Also ordered a chicken chimichanga.  Can't say I was shorted on the chicken, that's all it was.  About a pound of white (and some dark) meat chicken packed in clumps into the tortilla.  Again, couldn't find the cheese.  Maybe they ran out.   Needless to say, had just a few bites and the rest went to the dogs.  I wish Los Taquitos would have been open at this hour!!"}
{"text":"I agree that the prices are a bit on the high side. BUT, the green chile burro is the best. I've not had anything else there, but that one I can attest to, is great!! Also, the service is kind of meh. They don't seem enthused about their jobs. But whatever."}
{"text":"Great choice for fast causal Mexican!  Real plates and tasty, and reasonably hot salsa and chips complimentary.  Our to-go place for very reasonably priced Mexican at a place that is great to take kids.    My wife says most amazing place ever and worth moving to Arizona for.  It's not quite that good, but I for one, benefit from my wife's charitable grading on many things so I don't contradict her here."}
{"text":"They always forget to put in my order when I call for carryout. I'd think twice about this particular franchise. The one in Chandler is a lot more professional."}
{"text":"This a really nice comfortable locals spot for quality Mexican food. The refried beans, beef tacos, enchiladas, breakfast scramblers, and chips and salsa are all excellent. The food is always consistent. The staff is very friendly, personable and family oriented.   It may not be culinarily pushing the envelope but it is traditional American-Mexican food that hits the spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Not too happy with the food quality over cooked my taquitos 6$ for a steak burrito that was nasty very disappointed"}
{"text":"Being from southeast Arizona, this place was totally disappointing, the atmosphere is great, but the food is more tex-mex, not authentic. Not worth the price nor the trip."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would!!  We recently moved to the neighborhood & decided to try a new neighborhood place. Arrived at 6:30 pm on a Friday, knowing they would be busy.  But after ordering, waiting, watching every table that ordered before AND after us get their food - and trying to be nice - we gave up. We went back up and asked for the manager.  We showed him the time stamp on our receipt...we had waited 50 MINUTES! They couldn't even find our ticket! No one knew anything about our order. Then, even though our receipt was itemized and showed exactly what we ordered, he said that since he \"didn't know what we ordered he just entered the total on the bottom of the receipt for our refund.\" The system had added taxes again, so he refunded us $2 more than the total amount we actually paid. They need to figure out their own system! I can't leave a review on the food, because we never tasted any. Needless to say - it was the first AND last time we will even think about walking through their doors."}
{"text":"So I ordered the carne asada burrito. It was almost entirely beans and rice. Maybe 10% carne asada. But I only noticed from the texture. Sure didn't taste it. From there I would say the burrito was ok, for a rice and bean. The best redeeming quality of my food was the hot sauce. Best I've had yet in AZ. But still only so so compared to what I am used to getting."}
{"text":"I am so happy the Someburros has finally ventured North and opened a location in Scottsdale....although I really wish it was closer to Old Town where I live, but I will take what I can get!  The Borracho Burro is the best....a must try!   And while you can't drive thru and order, the drive thru pick up window for take out is a nice perk!"}
{"text":"This spot is awesome I've Been going here for about 9 months. This is the most consistent restaurant...check it out you'll agree... tip top in all areas! Good Mexican food and you can order fries on the side.  Red chilli meat burrito rocks (made with roast not ground beef). Refried beans are super yummy too. Pricrs are luke a fast food joint but it's all homemade Restaurant is aways clean and the employees are fun"}
{"text":"I ordered a side of pinto beans , got it to go, went home, opened bag to find refried beans. Receipt says \" pinto beans\" Ridiculous. Learn English."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since 1992. It isn't the same since Renee (the manager) moved to the Scottsdale location. The food is still good, but we used to feel welcomed when we went in...everyone knew our name and our family. Now we go and we are just another paying customer."}
{"text":"Not only does the veggie burro rock my world, but the chips and salsa make my life complete. I easily eat here 1-2 times a week (as embarrassing as it is). It's the perfect place for lunch with the outdoor seating so you don't get that food smell on your clothes for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"We were in town for the ACU football game (go Firestorm!!)   We checked into our hotel and were starved. Found this adorable place. Really good food. My husband loved the hot sauce. Service was wonderful. Atmosphere was fun. Will I go back?  Heck yes!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. 2 chicken tacos rice and beans :) very good"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican fast food. No fuss, no muss. Straightforward good food."}
{"text":"Honestly, not that exciting. I heard a lot of hype about it from ASU friends of mine but I wasn't impressed. It was just your run of the mill Mexican food. And I didn't like that you ordered at the counter and got your chips in a paper gravy boat. The whole concept of the resturant would flow so much easier if it was set up like a regular sit down Mexican resturant. But appreantly it makes wonderful hangover food. I dunno."}
{"text":"Bean Tostada. Side of rice, small Diet. This was my mantra for years at lunch time - I  used to go for lunch almost every day, and still go frequently. My whole family loves it. The beans and rice are killer - so fresh and homeade - I am hungry thinking of them. The chips can be not as good if they aren't hot, but normally are really good and salsa often has a slight kick that is perfect. We have tried it all - tacos - the shredded beef is SO good...tostadas, taquito's, burritos, enchiladas...etc...never have i had a bad meal here. Its also fast, and inexpensive. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Felibertos more older and classy brother. The food is simple and fresh. Best part was the salsa."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for over 20 years. We started at the one in Tempe & now eat at the Gilbert location. Good prices, great food. Love their bean burritos. Their salsa (mild & hot) sooo GREAT!"}
{"text":"For a \"fast food\" place to get good Mexican food, this place takes the cake.  It is a hybrid between a Filberto's and a sit down Mexican food restaurant..  The prices are right in the middle and you get chips and salsa. The salsa is more a straight sauce, rather then tomato chunks, etc.. however, it is still very very good with their chips. They actually sell their salsa as well.  All of their food tastes great, with the same quality (if not better) then sit down restaurants.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Pollo Fundido! That's all I'm gonna say! That and wear stretchy pants!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip in to this place and I was not impressed. The service was fine - nice, speedy, polite. It's the food I had an issue with. I have never been to a Mexican establishment that charged for green salsa when they give chips and salsa for free. It turned me off a little. Then the food came and my burrito (boracho burro) was rather bland. My dining partner got a carne asada burro and his was very dry. I just was not impressed with the food at this establishment."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, loved it, as a self proclaimed taco snob from San Diego, I have tried tacos from Mazatlan, Baja, along our border on both sides. This was a real treat from the beans to the tacos, from the fresh chips to the colorado sauce. A great family restaurant for nearly thirty years. Good job to the family and their crews. Wish they were closer to Anthem up north. Mucho gusto"}
{"text":"Best refried beans and homemade tortillas around! Was absolutely delighted with the quality, taste and price of the food here. You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Always love popping in SomeBurros.  Staff is great, its always clean and i LOVE the chips and salsa. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"The nachos are my favorite, Someburros has some good stuff under the Munchies De Mexico section of the menu."}
{"text":"I had high hopes as a Coloradan in Arizona after I read all the other reviews on Yelp. My husband and I ordered the tamale, taco combo plate with green chili. It was the blandest food I've ever eaten, and it was swimming in cheese. There was no flavor at all in anything on the plate. Even Chipotle is better.  My husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid. Well, now we know the food is on the same level. We went because they offer a drive-through window if you call ahead. I think that's the best thing I can say about it."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this restaurant a lot. I mean, at least 2-3 times a week back when I was in my early twenties. I eventually moved to Chandler and occasionally frequented the one by the Chandler mall as well as a few other locations, but this one has always been my favorite.  For one, it is rarely crowded. It's at the very end of a strip mall that's mostly vacant and is not visible from the street. Most of it's business probably comes from long time customers and the Kiwanis Park neighborhood that it's situated in. Actually, it's hard to think of another reason why this is better than the other Someburros locations. Their quality and restaurant/menu format is pretty much consistent regardless of which location you visit. For me, I guess I just have a lot of memories here.  Well, after taking a break from the Someburros franchise entirely for the last couple years, I found myself at this restaurant once again a few weeks ago, now that I am back living in the 85283. I have to say, not one thing has changed. It's just as good as it was back then.  The chips and salsa are awesome and always complimentary. If you are getting takeout, you won't automatically get this unless you ask for it while you wait for your order(no, they won't package it up for you \"to go\" free of charge). Some people on here complain about the salsa. It's not the typical salsa you get in a sit down Mexican place, it's more like the kind you get at one of those places if you request their hotter sauce. It's not full of diced tomatoes, cilantro, diced onions, etc. It's a thinner sauce, but very delicious and spicy. It's really good, and when I was in last, a paid a few dollars extra to take a big container of it home with me.  The only entree I've ever had from here was the Pollo Fundido. Until I discovered Nando's out in Mesa, this was the best version of the Pollo Fundido/Rico dish I had tasted. To be fair, though, Nandos is an actual sit down/be served restaurant and Someburros is more of a hybrid fast food place. And no, Lisa S, Julios does not have the best Pollo Fundido, in fact, I would argue Someburros is just as good, if not better.  So, that's all I have to say about Someburros. Give it a chance, you probably won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good for fried Mexican fast food. I feel that they overcharge for the amount of food you receive and I was under the impression that it was an actual restaurant instead of somewhere where you'd seat yourself. Can't say I'd go back. Their catered stuff is good though."}
{"text":"Utilized call ahead ordering this time. Steven was at the window and was very friendly and helpful definitely made up for poor service last time!!   Wonderful food as usual."}
{"text":"I honestly had no idea what to expect before walking into this place.  I imagined just another Filiberto's-type place.  My friend insisted that the food here is good, so I agreed to come along.  The restaurant is clean, cheery and bright inside.  Menus are in an easy to read format, posted up high on the wall so you can see them.  Even though this is a casual seat-yourself kinda place, the restaurant staff is constantly buzzing about, cleaning and bringing food.  Nobody was sitting around looking lazy or staring at their cellphones.  The girl who rang me up could've used a personality...she acted like she was trying to hide her annoyance that she had to take yet another order.  The rest of the staff was friendly and helpful though.  The food is 1000%.  We had burritos, chimichangas and cheese crisps.  I LOVED it.  I was disappointed that they were out of margaritas, but I'm fine!  Based on atmosphere, cleanliness and food alone, I'll be back....TOMORROW!"}
{"text":"I have no Idea why you wouldn't love this place. It is a basic fast food mexican restaurant and all the food is authentic. I think there are just too many Jerks on Yelp. It is fast food, what do you expect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, they could not have disappointed me more if they had tried! The woman at the cashier's stand was unfriendly, the food took almost 10 minutes to come out even though it was a VEGGIE burrito so it didn't have any meat. No one bothered to apologize that we stood there waiting patiently while others got their food (including 2 cars in the drive thru.) Then they marked our orders wrong so when my spouse and I went our separate ways with our to go order we got the wrong burritos and couldn't switch. I was late going back to work, spent money on something I didn't even order, and was treated poorly. I'm sure not all experiences are like this based on so many good reviews (which is what made me choose this place in the first place!), but it was disappointing and I won't be going back even though it's near my home, and I was considering using it more often since it's so convenient. Guess not."}
{"text":"All the dishes I've ever tried here are very good. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is their horchata. Do not but it. I don't know what it is about it, but it's disgusting. Order a soda, and you're good to go."}
{"text":"This place isn't reinventing the wheel. It is good Mexican food, fast. Their family owns a sit down Mexican restaurant called Poncho's in south Phoenix, around Baseline and Central. That restaurant pre-dates Some Burros. I am happy that Some Burros offers almost all the same items Poncho's does, with nearly identical quality. Poncho's is kind of a family favorite being from South Phoenix. So to get that kind of food in north Scottsdale for lunch is amazing. They are also very convenient in that you can order online and pick it up without leaving your car or if you dine in, they wait on you without the waiter. You order up front and pay, then they bring your food to you, wherever you sit. They also bus the tables. You get chips and salsa with your order, and their salsa is grand."}
{"text":"They have killer shredded beef burritos. Also the chips and sauce are delicious."}
{"text":"When I was still living in Arizona, I visited this place regularly. Their tortillas are amazing and their salsa is to die for. If you like Americanized Mexican food and you are a salsa fan, absolutely go here. I now have to go to great lengths to transport their salsa to Ohio.  I particularly enjoy their bean burritos. My boyfriend wants to marry their Borracho Burrito (beware of the resulting farts, though)."}
{"text":"Great little spot around the corner from our house. No frills, nothing fancy, but cheap and a good spot when you don't want to make dinner. I've had their burros, tacos, and flautas, all great. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Love this place for fast and cheap but yummy Mexican food. My favorite is the carne asada tacos but my boyfriend never gets anything but the pollo fundido."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and I love burritos, so I thought this place could be a Wonderful match. Instead, I'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever. These burritos were sub par, the prices were a bit much, and service was poor. I am a big supporter of local businesses but I won't support mediocrity. I'll pay more for quality, not to stick it to the man."}
{"text":"Yes, Julia T's review may be boring.  But, it didn't stop me from heading over to someburros.  Good thing!  She was spot on!    Nothing more I can say above what J said... Take a look at her review!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here once a week for years but I have had enough. More & more kids behind the counter, blank stares. No training. Don't see any Management."}
{"text":"I've been to Someburros a few times now - it's all been takeout so I can't speak to the service but I absolutely enjoy the food.  They have a big menu with tons of a la carte choices, I've had the bean tostada, cheese enchilada, nachos, guacamole, chips and salsa - these have been consistently tasty.  The beef potato taco was good but a little greasy (it's the kind of taco that is stuffed and then lightly fried in a pan), the shredded beef taco came with a soft corn tortilla - it was a little bland and the meat was too dry.  What bumps this from a three to four star is the huge menu and extremely cheap prices.  They also offer a variety of interesting sides/extras in different sizes.   The food is fresh too, no soggy lettuce or mealy tomatoes here.  Above average Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and the place was clean. The service was also very fast. However, the food was not good. My husband got the pollo fundido and the chicken was undercooked. I got the chicken tacos and they had no taste to them. I will say the rice and beans were ok. I wasn't expecting high end restaurant quality food, but I figured this might be better than going to a traditional fast food restaurant. I was wrong."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on a whim as we were in the shopping center and wanted to try someplace new. The restaurant was clean and service was good. While the food wasn't bad, it did seem like a fairly ordinary interpretation of Mexican food. Our burritos were alright, nothing to write home about, and the chips were fine. Not sure if we went at an off time, but we were there with only one other patron, so the atmosphere was lacking.   There was nothing that really stood out to make us want to choose this place over, say, Filiberto's (or any \"berto's\") or even Rubio's. Maybe if we're in the area, we'd give it another shot, but it's definitely not someplace I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice and wont go go back. I specifically ordered a gren corn tamale and got a red pork one instead which didnt taste very good. When I picked up my food today the enchilada and beans looked like they had been sitting out all day long vs the rice and beans that were made fresh the day before. Very inconsistant and not good at all."}
{"text":"Good for lunch when there is no mix ups with the lunch orders. Half our lunch group got there food first while the rest of had wait at least 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Ssshhhh! Don't say another word! You had me at....fresh brewed iced tea.  I've never eaten here but kid you not the iced tea here is good enough to be considered as good as any fresh brewed tea you would find in the South.  As a Texas boy I have need to regularly partake of fresh iced tea. This place has iced tea that would launch an army.  Drive thru is convenient and the service staff is awesome.  Speaking about the iced tea, I easily give five stars."}
{"text":"Take this review very seriously, I am not trying to be rude or funny, or even a prisoner of the moment...I promise.  For a good 7 seven years I  have held the belief that Buca di Beppo was the worst restaurant in the area, flavorless and decrepit! But there is a new sheriff in town, and his name is Someburros, and he is more evil than Arpiao.   With food worse than what is probably served in tent city, I am now reeling in horror at what may come tomorrow or even within the hour. You see, the \"meats\" in both my and my gf's burros have got to be canned or canner quality, you know...Friskas. Seriously. The nachos were nothing but old, whole corn tortillas shingled with tepid beans, cold cheddar cheese, and a good 8 oz of jalepenos! Speechless...  I'm sorry, but if you check in here, check yelp for a \"nearby\" urgent care center."}
{"text":"This is not the place to come if you are not prepared to wait a good 20 minutes for your take out to be prepared .  Staff are friendly but service too slow for me to come here again - it was not even the peak lunch period.  I have gone up from 2 to 3 stars as the food was very good (veggie burrito)."}
{"text":"Really good quick service Mexican food.  Definitely recommend the cheese crisp."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for over 20 years.  This is a order at the counter kind of place and the food is quite good.  The veggie burro is a favorite for several in our family, and of course the cinnamon crispies disappear off the table very quickly.  The wait staff is always friendly, and the whole place has a family atmosphere, and people who eat here are just friendly.  Mary Sanchez helps with the tables and cleans up and always makes you smile she is so enthusiastic.   I see others complaining in these reviews that it is a gringo place, but the cooks are not, most of the wait staff are not and and most times at least half of the customers are not.  We have  several Mexican food places we like, and Mexican food is a little like love, it's in the eye of the beholder.  This is just good family food, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"First time to the restaurant here. I'm filling out my yelp review as I sit here because I am so impressed. Just a great stop to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner! I wouldn't doubt that there isn't something on the menu anyone wouldn't like, considering you like all Hispanic food. I will definitely be back before I leave the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star American/Mexican food.  The take out drive through is super convenient on those busy nights.  My favorites are the rod burro and the borracho burro.    The tacos are good too."}
{"text":"Um, thanks yelpers for the LIES!   So i woke up from a nap today and me and the little child growing inside of me NEEDED a burrito. I told the bf to get on yelp and Someburros showed up with tons of reviews and a good amount of stars.  We arrive at Someburros and I see a good number of people inside so I'm thinking there's hope.. I've finally found a good mexican place in Arizona! But HAH! was I wrong.... let me break it down for you:  -I ask the girl if she has what I've been craving.. a big carne asada burrito. You know, the kind you can get at all other normal mexican restaurants? She says \"oh we don't have carne asada here, we only have shredded beef and ground beef\". (UH wtf?)  -we order a shredded beef burrito with some kind of sauce, then we ask what comes in it.. the girl says \"just meat and sauce\". We ask if we can put anything else in it and she says no. We look at the menu and all of their burritos have basically nothing in them!  - We realize that their burritos are basically giant soft taquitos, so we order this deep fried chicken burrito thing that's on sale on Wednesdays because it looked like it had the most ingredients in it.   -The chicken thing comes out, and for being \"on sale\" for 5 dollars, it was pretty small for the price.  I left full, but unhappy. It's definitely better than that nasty Filibertos, but at least Filibertos has carne asada!! If anyone knows of a good place to get a burrito, PLEASE send me a message."}
{"text":"My family and I love Someburros! Food is spot on every time. The new look is great as well."}
{"text":"Really not good.  I don't always trust reviews, but the food was really not good. I am a manager of a business that gets a lot of Yelp reviews, and I always try and give good reviews instead of negative (bad experiences), but this restaurant isn't worth it.  I purchased the pollo fundido and over all it was the worse pollo fundido I have ever had.   I ordered online, and picked up my order 15 minutes later at the Scottsdale location.  The food was warm at best.  The pollo fundido had VERY processed chicken that was some what questionable and not appetizing.  It is the first time that I have not finished the pollo fundido and through it away.  I had to order a side of chips, and assumed some good salsa would come with it.  Someone else said that their salsa is like hot sauce, and I completely agree. It was honestly a joke. I looked through the 5 small containers, and all of it was the exact same. It was runny, and exactly like hot sauce coming out of a bottle.   I would recommend Carlos O'briens that is less then 2 miles away.  The cheaper prices at Someburos is not worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a fairly inexpensive, sit down style restaurant. We take our 2 kids (ages 5 & 7) at least a couple times a month. I usually get a bean & cheese burro and a chicken taco. My wife loves the chimis, and the kids get a kids meal..usually the chicken taquitos. After dinner we almost always walk over and do a little shopping at Trader Joe's. Always clean, good prices, great food, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Always a go to place for our family to eat. Love the veggie burro and #9 and my hubby always gets pollo fundido. Always leave full."}
{"text":"What make Some Burros is their hot sauce. What usually makes my friends and I crave Some Burros is their hot sauce. As with all Mexican restaurants, their hot sauces usually vary and some are different. I don't know how well I can explain their sauce other than it's red, it comes with your food, it has lots of pepper seeds, and it's just the right amount of hot. We go through a TON of it. I don't understand why they have a bean burrito, plain, you have to add cheese...but when you add the cheese...yummers. Their tortillas are nice and soft but thick and strong at the same time. When I ate meat, I discovered their Shredded Chicken and bean burrito. Holy cow! Most juicy and tender chicken ever...so delicious with beans and of course I added cheese. It seems like a crime to even put sauce on this particular burrito it's so good. The rice here is good. I usually don't eat crunchy tacos because of the oil and shell but they don't serve them soft here...and let me tell you...their shredded beef taco is yummer-ee-no! Enchiladas good, quesadilla good, chips and hot sauce, yeah yo. Overall, standard Taco shop prices, consistent food, good quality, hot sauce it great, and plus one for having a pick-up window for phone orders."}
{"text":"I ate at Somburros for dinner around 8:30 or 9:00pm.  The place was not too busy.  It was clean and brightly lit.  I was greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter who too my order.  I had the #1 combo a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.  With a medium soda the check came to just under $9.  A small tray of tasty chips was included.  Not cheap.    Mexican food in Tempe has to be great just to stay in business.  There is so much competition.  So my two stars would probably be three in another town, like French Lick Indiana.  It's a real town without many Mexican food places.     The taco was just ok.  A little on the small side.  The corn tortilla was fried in old oil which gave it a burnt stale taste.  The chicken was tasty, and the lettuce was crisp.  There was a little cheese in there too.  It tasted cheesy.   The enchilada  sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown.  I'm not an enchilada expert but I've had better.  This cheese enchilada was flat and I could not taste any onions.   The rice and beans were average.    On the bright side the food was hot.    I didn't find Someburros to be a very good value.  I have had much better tacos and  enchiladas at full service restaurants for less money.   I'm going to keep looking for some great tacos."}
{"text":"Food is average. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Over priced for what you get. This specific location also had a lot of teenagers working there who have poor customer service skills and attitudes."}
{"text":"OK, so I re-visited Some Burros today specifically for the Chicken Fundido special. Somehow they managed to pack a ton of flavor into this chimichanga-esque dish for the awesome price of $5.00, so much so in fact that i've gave them another star. This dish is great, no question about it, and for only $5.00 I might become a Wednesday regular."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place for the food, but the service is indeed a little awkward but the employees are trying to do as good a job as they can.  Would be eating there right now if I could."}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast burritos in scottsdale! I haven't been able to find a solid breakfast burrito since moving to Arizona and Someburros has a bigger selection. I haven't tried the lunch here but have heard it is good."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic or delicious mexican joint in town, I've had tastier food at those drive-thru Mexican places but Someburros has a couple perks.  1.  They sell margaritas 2. They have a drive-thru pickup window for phone orders 3. Good deals on groupon now, and prices are already  fairly low  Tip, try the pollo fundido- it's like a chimichange, and best thing I've tried here so far."}
{"text":"Is it under new management?  We were there yesterday, we walked in, the place was a mess!  The lady cleaning the table I'm sure didn't know what she was doing. There was a young family looking for a table, there wasn't a clean one to be found. They asked 3 times, yes 3 times could we have are table cleaned.  The lady ignored them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. We had to do a take out because there's just no place to eat. Even the food was disappointing.  Enough said, we wouldn't be returning."}
{"text":"Lately when my boyfriend and I go here, I get pretty sick after I eat the chicken, but I have a sensitive stomach so thats usually normal. HOWEVER, my boyfriend went two days without me and ended up with food poisoning, and it was not pretty at all. He ate something that was not out of the norm- a burrito. Be careful of this place, ever since the new Tempe location opened the quality has gone down and my boyfriend and I will never visit a Some Burros after his food poisoning incident."}
{"text":"I have been to Someburros one other time, Food was just ok. I decided to today to try their breakfast burritos. After waiting for 30 minutes they had forgotten my order and then lied and said that it takes a long time to cook chorizo. She speaks to the cooks in Spanish to make my order and then turns to me and states said that it was not her fault, then whos fault would it be? Blame it on the cooks? Avoid this place! Poor service, awful food and employees who blame others and don't even apologize when they make a mistake. Eek! Me thinks not."}
{"text":"Dont get what all the fuss is about this place. Just tried for the first time for lunch and .....meh. Nothing special.Their normal combos dont even include a drink, and they were almost 10.00$!.    My tamale was a strange affair- very soft masa outside. The taco was hardly filled. Will not return."}
{"text":"The service was great and my food was good. However, it's been over 24hr and I haven't ate since that meal. I feel like I have some case of food poisoning. But the food is good and service is great, I might've just has a bad batch of something from their kitchen that day."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was really fast..!  My girlfriend and I got our breakfast burritos just minutes after ordering.  The Diablo breakfast burrito is one of the best I've ever had!! Staff was real cool.. Nice and tidy looking place.. Am definitely hittin this place up again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Came 2 times in 1 week. Both times though...Juanita has bad customer service. Asked her for some things like chips and water cups and she said ok and never gave them to us. She moved on to the next people so we had to ask someone else. Today we are here again and she brought us our food and didn't say a word. Just flopped it down on the table. Didn't ask whose food was whos. We were flip flopping dishes around giving whoever had that certain food theirs. Not a people person. Maybe she would be best utilized in the kitchen where she doesn't interact with people"}
{"text":"We frequent Someburros quite often.  We always order El Pollo Fundido everytime we got because we know it's going to taste good everytime we come in.  I've ordered other things on the menu and always go back to Pollo Fundido.  They make the food super quick even when they are really busy!  It's always clean in the dining area and the bathrooms too.  Everytime someone visits from out of town i take them there and they like it a lot.   We've gone to their other locations and it's always consistent as well."}
{"text":"I don't live in Arizona anymore, but when I did I always ate a some burros in Tempe. Every now and then I would eat at the other locations. Well we came for a visit and of course we needed to stop here. The place was filthy and not cleaned up. Our Pollo Fundido did not taste as good as it normally does. And on top of that my husband, myself and a friend all got food poisoning. It was awful!!!! So whoever is preparing the meals isn't washing their hands or fully cooking the chicken. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered taquitos off the menu. It was supposed to come with a side, drink, and churro. However, when my food came, I only received my taquitos and some guacamole. The taquitos were over cooked, burnt, and flavorless. They were very dry and had nothing but dry shredded chicken in it. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love Someburros. Great place to get cheap, tasty Mexican food that tastes authentic. This is the perfect place to swing by when you're in a hurry or want some take-out or want Mexican without paying to 'eat out'. My one complaint is they don't serve salsa, only hot sauce, (no bueno). They also have a decent selection of Mexican beers!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant for the food and the service.  The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous, making the restaurant a pleasure to visit. They make you feel welcome from the time you enter the door.  We try to hit Taco Tuesday as often as possible since it's such a great treat, and we're hooked on their chicken tacos.  Wish we lived closer but when we're in the neighborhood we always try to make a stop at Someburros."}
{"text":"Too many flies inside the restaurant to be able to enjoy our meal. Rice was great. The cashier at the counter was rushing us but there was no one else in line."}
{"text":"After a disappointing visit to another popular fast food mexican joint this week, my expectations were a bit low. I ordered the chorizo burrito with jalapeños cheese, potatoes and sour cream and man it was so good! Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"My husband likes them, I don't.  He likes the bean burritos with cheese and sour cream, but at around five bucks each and nothing exciting, I would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Chicken taco's are the BOMB! BOOM... Good flavor, value and clean! Passes my test for semi fast food."}
{"text":"Oh Pollo Fundido where have you been all of my life. I have never actually eaten here until recently. My company always gets party trays from here for our holiday open house and they are always very good and very popular with the guests and employees. One day last month a coworker says we should go to this place for lunch. They are having a special on their Pollo Fundido. What is that? Oh it is really good. You should try it. Ok. Let's go. Hope it is good. We get there at lunch time and the place is hopping. Pretty busy. Get up to the counter after a little bit of a wait and say the secret password to get the deal. Food comes out just a few minuets after the order is placed and it is back to the office to eat. First bite: WOW THIS IS REALLY GOOD! Mmmmmmm. How did I not know about this. My coworker tells me that Someburros Pollo Fundido is good but another place makes it better. Better than this? I don't know if I could handle that because this is really good. I have had it a few times now and it is still just as good as the first time. I don't know if I will ever get to try anything else on the menu because the Pollo Fundido is so good. Maybe one day. Why are you still sitting there reading this? Get over there now and order one. Do it. Right now. But it is after lunch. So go anyway. It can be a second lunch or an early dinner. But they are closed. So sit outside of the door and wait for them to open. Just get over there and try one now. Right now. Go. Pollo Fundido!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing family owned place in AZ! Everything has me coming back.  I love the rice, tortillas, and the salsa!! I eat here once a week I love the pollo, enchiladas, tamales and more......even their catering is on point. I'm very leased with them."}
{"text":"My burrito (buracho-- green chili and cheese) was pretty good, if a bit small for the price ($7.45).  I would get it again.  The cheese crisp (a quesadilla any place else) with green chilies was also pretty good.  I would get that again as well.  I'll be skipping the tacos, though.  We tried the shredded beef, the carne asada, and the ground beef with potato ($2.50 avg. Per taco) -- none of which were any good.  The tortillas were soggy with grease, the meats were unseasoned and tasteless.  Well, except the carne asada.  It tasted like a chopped up charcoal briquette.  Ew.  There are many other places around doing better (and cheaper) tacos.  I would advise sticking with the burritos or the quesadillas here, you'll be happier.  Again, I must warn you against getting the tacos! It's that important.  If you insist, it is on your own head.  I tried to tell you!"}
{"text":"Someburros comes from the same family as the longtime South Phoenix staple \"Ponchos\". However, Someburros has somehow managed to take the family business to a whole another level! I've been to several different Someburros and they all consistently have good food, service and atmosphere. My favorites include the Green Chile Burro enchilada style and the tacos. The beans and rice are always moist and better than that you get free chips and salsa with your meal. I like how the atmosphere is more Mexican-American but the food is definitely authentic!  If you hate a crowd avoid Lunch hours like the plague. If you are in a hurry you can also call your order in ahead of time and pick it up through the drive through take out window."}
{"text":"I like Someburros.  It's nothing fancy but they have good mexican food and quick service.  The red sauce is tasty.  I would't really travel out of my way to get here, but if I  I am near by I head in."}
{"text":"Someburros isn't exactly AMAZING, but it is pretty good. I've been a few times and had a number of different things off the menu. The restaurant itself is a bit unexpected. You order your food, which always comes with chips, sit down, and they bring you your food. For some reason the place seems a little off to me, but the staff is super friendly and has always been helpful, answering questions about the menu.  As for the food, I think the carne asada burritos are their best item as is the maccaha beef. There is lots going on in them and it's pretty darn tasty. I've also had a couple of the breakfast burritos and they are good, but need a sauce or something... they are very dry. Also, they are very greasy leaving me with a bit of a stomachache after, so be prepared.  All in all for a quick bite when your in the mood for a burrito, I'd surely recommend Someburro. Don't expect to be blown away, but for the price this spot is really solid."}
{"text":"They increased their prices to restaurant prices. It's $10 for the \"special.\" Most menu items don't come with rice, beans, sour cream, sauce, or guacamole and you have to pay extra for each and everything. Way too overpriced for fast food Mexican. The chips and salsa suck. The food is decent but not $12 a person (after paying for every little thing the menu item should include anyway). My daughter had chimichangas and they tasted like they had been sitting under a light bulb for hours.  Almost gave 2 stars but the chicken and beans are decent."}
{"text":"This place is good food and a good value.  The best part is if you call your order in for pick up when you get there you just go through the drive up window.  You never have to get out of your car!"}
{"text":"Veggie Burro is perfection! Whole pinto beans, homemade Guacamole, cilantro, cheese, and salsa!! The tortillas taste authentic and fresh. Hubby loves the pollo fundido. All white meat chicken(breast)  burro topped with a spicy cream cheese and cheese. My rating is four stars because they charge for chips and salsa in the drive thru. :( Come on...a little bag o chips and some yummy salsa won't kill your business bottom line....but it will make happier customers!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday and their tacos are way too greasy and nasty. It was my first time and there was a hair in one of my tacos, I couldn't eat it. I was so disgusted."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese enchilada combo to-go. It took about 25 minutes. They were not particularly busy, maybe 10-15% capacity. Several people were seated and served while I waited. No priority for to-go orders. That being said, this is a tempe staple that has solid Mexican food. I just wish they put a little more focus to their service."}
{"text":"While the food is pretty good and there's a big selection on the menu, it's hard to justify the cost when you've got a slew of other awesome Mexican places nearby for much less. The people were super friendly though and there's online ordering available, which makes this a better option despite cost at times."}
{"text":"We've lived in Phoenix for several years now and haven't found a good Mexican food place we really love.  It's all been OK.  Being from Texas, I'm wondering if it's just the style of Mexican food as I'm assuming most place I'm used to is probably TexMex-type and me not actually having had \"real\" Mexican food really don't know the difference.  Anyway, This place was OK.  Nothing to write home about.  The tamale I got wasn't smooth and melt-in-your-mouth like I like 'em but it was OK.  The enchilada wasn't too bad.  Service was decent.  I don't think I'd come out of my way to come here but maybe if we were in the area I'd come back.  I will say though, the line was busy so you should probably at least try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Some.......delicious  mexi food!!   Seriously,,I had kind of given up on finding great Mexican food, so one night hubby and I wandered in since we had exhausted everything in our hood worthy of a try except for this place.  Simple review,,,,EXCELLENT FOOD, good prices, done! That's no donkey-bull!"}
{"text":"TWO BIG THUMBS DOWN! I do not know if it is just me but arizona does not have good mexican food. Someburros should not even be classified as mexican food to be honest. maybe its because i'm from California, and we got all the good mexicans. a burrito here consist of beef or chicken wrapped in a tortilla! with nothing else! no way hombre! and they don't even have carne asada, its ground beef. luckily i was there on the right evening where they had a chimichanga for $5 that came with a little more than just meet. and the only reason i ate it was because i was starving and then it was still only \"ok\".  recommendation- keep driving till you see taco bell"}
{"text":"The machacha chimichanga is fantastic with the green chile sauce. I suggest you order a side of the green chile sauce. Drink it."}
{"text":"This is a great quick Mexican food restaurant. Like others have said, this is more than a couple notches above Filibertos but just a hair down from Manuel's, Aribas, or Macayo's. The hot sauce for the chips is great . . . Not too hot but not watered down like some spots. Go for their Pollo Fundido . . . . The best this side of Julio G.'s"}
{"text":"The horchata is to die for, they even have me a sample to try it before I bought the beverage. The food is amazing, good fish tacos are hard to come by, but I am impressed. It looks like their old burro (donkey) logo is gone but their food is still just as great. My family came to visit and requested Some Burros over anything else first!"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered from sombreros to go. The Tempe location my check number was 182 I ordered a beef chimi with green sauce a beef taco beef enchilada  no garnish and rice along with a large drink. When my order came to go I checked it thank God because they gave me fries instead of rice. They gave me the rice when I hit someone's attention .When I got home my taco nor my enchilada had any cheese on it . I just had sauce on the enchilada and maybe two pieces of shredded cheese of . all I saw was the corn tortilla and sauce on my enchilada. My taco with meat and lettuce. My enchilada was tasteless with just a tortilla and the meat and sauce. The tasted bland. I never had an enchilada I didn't like. And I didn't like this. For sure!I really like someburros however this doesn't give me faith TO order takeout again. I've been a loyal customer of the Tempe location since it opened in 1986. Quality control needs to be taken care of. And the back and be forgiving to the front and give it to the customer. Improve your process to make sure that everything is taken care of it I'll food has what it needs on it and in it."}
{"text":"Freakin good food! My first time here and it was delicious! Highly recommend this place! We went to Cafe Rio last week and not only was it over priced but the food was terrible. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick Mexican food stop."}
{"text":"Really yummy mexican food. Fast friendly staff. Order at the counter and either take out, or sit in their dining area and they will bring your meal to you. Both food and service better than the \"sit down\" more expensive mexican restaurants I have tried in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've always had good food here. Great burritos, cheese crisps, and churros! I wish I had a cheese crisp and a churro right now.  Excellent basic Mexican fast food. Not great for a date, but great to fill you up with yummy any day of the week.  This is officially my most boring review ever. I am too tired to be witty or interesting, but don't let that keep you from grubbing on this deliciousness.  Buenos noches....."}
{"text":"My mother told me that if you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all.  So, this will be short.  The service was good.  Nice, friendly staff. They have about 2 zillion menu items on their very large menu board.  When I walked up to the cashier she asked what I'd like.  I just kept reading the menu.  She asked again. I just smiled and said, \"I'll need a moment\".  I had the #4 Combo which is three small bean mini-burros, guacamole and refried beans.  In deference to my mother's advice, it was edible.  Did we need another fast food Mexican restaurant in N. Scottsdale? No. Does this place even come close to Rubios or Baja Fresh? No.  Sorry Mom!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since Basically my whole life. I always loved their beans and would usually get a bean burrito growing up. I had since moved it of state and came back to visit and we decided to make a stop for some Mexican food. I got the carne Asada burrito, it came with pico de avocado and beans and rice. It was super delicious. the burrito itself is about a medium size, it was very filling and I couldn't even finish it. The beans were just how I remember them haha. I got an horchata for a drink and it was the best, other places it's either watered down or extremely cinnamon-y and too sweet. This was just right!!! I definitely recommend this family owned business and would obviously come again!"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 for an average breakfast burrito. Average at best. Definitely nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"I am impressed!  Cute, clean, tasty.  And I'm hard to please with Mexican food.  It rivals some of the \"better\" Mex restaurants for traditional fare.  I loved the green chili burro.  The guacamole was very nice. The chips were fresh and not greasy.    Actually - better restaurants could learn a lot from the decor and ambiance in Some Burros.  Tasteful, colorful flowers on every table - even on the outside tables.  That's part of a good experience.  Table delivery is a plus for a \"fast food\" restaurant.  Management and employees were happy and attentive.  We'll be back......soon."}
{"text":"We have patronized the Baseline location for years but it has been slowly declining.  My daughter was in town and wanted to treat the family to Someburros so we called in our order.  Went to pick up and waited as usual to be noticed.  Our order was $59.45 and all my daughter had were hundred dollar bills which she tried to give the girl.  She said they don't accept anything bigger than a $20!  Really! With large orders it seems ridiculous but oh well; we used a card.  The gal gave us our order and as my daughter was checking it the gal said; we don't have chocolate milk.Would you like orange juice?  No, the children want milk; so she went to get white. Nope! No white milk; would you like orange juice? NO! So, we said; since we paid could we have a small bag of chips instead?  We got the \"eye roll\", the look of; are you crazy and the stare. I told her we paid for milk that you don't have so could we have chips? We got chips but they were handed to us like here; go away!  NOT good customer service!!  I remember the days when the family worked here and it was a pleasure to interact with them. NO LONGER!  This will be our last visit."}
{"text":"Someburro's kicks ass.  It's a nice middle ground between the standard *Berto's and the more sit-down experience.  Pollo Fundido and Borracho Burritos are awesome.  Service is quick. Beaners are bean-y.  There's nothing spectacular about this place, just really good, solid food served hot and quick.  Dig it."}
{"text":"Greasy greasy greasy....Which might not have bothered me in my younger years, but gosh, my stomach cant handle food just dripping in grease anymore, nor do I want to put that into my body!  I had 2 chicken tacos, refried beans and rice.  The reason for the 3 stars is because it still managed to taste good ;)  It was tasty and I really enjoyed the refried beans and rice, but there are better taco options out there minus the grease."}
{"text":"Horchaita was good as well as the free chips. Fish tacos were decent but it's still fast food."}
{"text":"The breakfast burros here in this location are bigger and that's about the only difference in the two locations. It's not your best version, but not the worst either. Potato, onion and egg seems to be a fairly healthy choice, but there was some gas involved, so beware of that fact if you are going to work after downing one of these. Only 4 bucks, so it does not break the bank either. It does seems like way too big of a building for this place."}
{"text":"This place was very family-friendly, the staff was extremely courteous and hospitable, and the food was delicious. I will go back."}
{"text":"I love their shredded beef taco and beans and rice. They have great carne Asada burritos and green chili chimis. I love the the drive thru."}
{"text":"Tried this joint out the other night after driving by the place for a year or so, was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely \"gringo\" Mexican food, but it was really fresh and tasty. Much better than other gringo-mex places such as Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Its a partial fast food place in that you order at the counter and they bring it to your table on trays, also with a fill your own soda fountain. They have very nice tables and booths, and the place was extremely clean and presentable. Not sure I'll make a habit of frequenting this spot, because I prefer more authentic, spicy mexican food, but this is a good place for folks with mild palettes."}
{"text":"I was there today and tried the pollo fundido that has gotten such good reviews.  And it was bad.  Really, really bad.  Too salty, not enough sauce and already limp and wet by the time I got it, and I ordered it there!!    $10 and I feel like I just ordered a salt lick.  And also, what is up with the \"salsa\"?  I think they are stealing packets from taco bell.  Will I be back?  Hell no.  That food was just nasty."}
{"text":"Two out of the last three times the quality was very poor....burro with very little meat and enchiladas with very little cheese...and they skimped on the beans and rice too......called to complain to management and received comps for next visit but really disappointed in recent visits."}
{"text":"I love Someburros! Chips and salsa! Red chili cheese crisp. Can't beat the convenience and price."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Scottsdale from  Orange County and was in desperate need of really good Mexican food.  And I found it here.   The inside is decorated nicely.  Everything here seems authentic.   Their salsa is great! One of the best I've had in a while.  They other a wide variety of catering for a great price.  They also sell tamales for the holidays! (Which I am definitely taking advantage of)"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and will give you a smile.  The store is clean.   The plaza is very nice and a good place to shop for all kinds of things.  That said, the food is typical of a chain style and reflects my 3 rating.   I'm sure many people will enjoy the food.  I just prefer a Pollo Asado Burrito from one of the local \"mom & pop\" shops.   Overall, it's OK."}
{"text":"I placed an online order and had a pickup time of 6:26pm. I arrived at 6:27 and was told by the kid in the drive through it was not ready and to circle around. After waiting 20 extra minutes due to the line I received my order which was cold out of the box. I called to speak to a manager and the only option I was given was to come back for them to remake it. I decided to just eat it cold only to find what looks like a piece of a plastic toy inside the enchilada I ordered."}
{"text":"We love this place for it's all-day breakfast burritos!  Service is always awesome and hot sauce is delicious too!  We are customers a few times a month!  So tasty!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Their salsa is the highlight.  All in all good if you're in a pinch and definitely better than average.  Fresh ingredients.  There are better options in Tempe, but closer to campus not by this location."}
{"text":"Wow, the chicken taco plate was outstanding. Loved the hot sauce and the ice cold Corona. We will be back. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I grew up eating authentic Mexican food at a restaurant near my cousin's house in Southside Chicago. I'm not sure what I ordered, but I'm ashamed. Not sure if it was cause I ordered at 11 at night, or the \"burros\" are made this way. I felt like it was low quality and effort. It was not worth my money. I'm giving two stars in hopes of coming back to try a taco. You can't mess that up..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent for the price! The staff was friendly, answering questions while we were in line. I accidentally left my purse there and they held it behind the counter for me until I could come and get it. Will definitely be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I ended up trying this place because I live close to it and was looking for a good breakfast burrito spot.  I recently moved from San Diego so I'll admit my standards are high.    I've ordered the breakfast burrito with egg, bacon, cheese and potato - it was only ok.  Not great.  It's too small.  I guess I'd come here again in a pinch, but I'm going to keep searching for a really good breakfast burrito.    Verdict:  Come here if you're out of options."}
{"text":"Please is always friendly and welcoming.   We usually stop by a few times a month. We look forward to coming again!  Oh and the drive thru is always pretty fast.  Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Meh, I hate writing reviews like this, especially cause the cashier was so nice. The food just wasn't very good. I had the pollo fundido and horchata. The chicken was dry and the horchata didn't taste right."}
{"text":"We had a large party catered by Somburro's yesterday and between Renee and Johnny who got my ordered dialed in to Eva, Brooklyn and Laura who helped me when picking it up, it was the best experience! I highly recommend Somburro's whether it be for a quick meal or a catered function. The food was perfectly executed and delicious not to mention the graciousness of all involved was much appreciated. Thank you All at Somburro's for making this a bagillion star experience!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch a few times here this year when I worked nearby. I'd gotten a couple of breakfast burritos that were acceptable, with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla. I guess I am spoiled by Carolina's tortillas. I also think it's baloney that they charge the to-go people for chips, but not those who sit and dirty their tables. How does that make sense?  The real travesty is the $5 fundido Wednesday special. My colleagues were so gaga over it for weeks, that I finally broke down and got one. When I expressed my *ahem* disappointment, I got labeled a \"foodie snob.\"  If being a foodie snob means that I don't find bland, boiled, hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other sub-standard ingredients acceptable, then I am a proud foodie snob. I've had fundido at plenty of other Mexican places around town, and this is no fundido."}
{"text":"Do not waste ur money. I live right next door to this place. Very dissapointed. Gross and expensive."}
{"text":"Pretty average Mexican food. Nothing special. It'll do in a pinch or if you're friends from out of town can't handle anything too authentic. Hot sauce is really good though."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  I wasn't expecting much can from a place with such a silly name. Rest assured, they do not serve donkey in this place. Lol.   Shredded beef tacos in crispy tortillas. This is a legit taco!!  The flavors going on in the carne are authentic and outstanding!  The chips?  Delicious!!  The salsas?  Fantastic!!  The service?  Really good!  The cleanliness?  Yes. They have that!  Lol  I only wish this place with a silly name were more conveniently located. I'd eat here all the time!!"}
{"text":"Last time I eat here! Food is so-so, and the service was rude. I have a small service dog that is carried in a pouch and was told to leave. Not a dog friendly place. Too many other good restaurants that want the business."}
{"text":"Counter people need to know what they are serving. Three different people were clueless when I popped the \"white chicken \" question. Finally, they said it was white meat, but a chicken burrito at this place only contains chicken in a tortilla for 4 bucks. Nothing else is inside - that is not a burrito in my mind. I ended up with the egg, onion and potato breakfast burro, which was small, but pretty good. Everything was well cooked and it wasn't as huge as some other places breakfast burros. The hot sauce was watery and had no taste, but the mild was better with more flavor and still a small bite. Chips are not included to-go. This is some sort of americanized mexican food despite what they tell you on website. Might be back for breakfast again, which is great that is served all day."}
{"text":"Fast inexpensive and unpretentious. It ain't authentic and doesn't pretend to be.  Not \"cheap,\" but not expensive.  Middle of the road, quick and comfortable."}
{"text":"This was a last minute choice when we were in the area. I had never been before and this location had just opened. The inside is very family friendly with new everything. The food just left something to be desired. I thought it was just OK for the price. I ordered a bean burrito and the tortilla tasted a little off--i couldnt put my finger on it. The chips and salsa were great though. The service was also good, lots of high school looking kids, but they were nice."}
{"text":"pretty darn tasty messican food, and almost fast enough to be called fast food. but this aint' no filiberto's. this place is packed at lunchtime every day of the week. the tamales are delicious - that's my measure of good mexican food i think... anyone can produce a good bean and chees burrtio, but if you can kill it on a tamale, you know what the eff you're doing!"}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this with... I don't like mexican food. But recently, after having some delicious Mexican food, I have been more easily persuaded. So after a hard workout on our way to TJ;s, we stopped off here. This place is awesome.  The food was delicious, the service was great, it was super clean (restrooms included) and did I mention- the food is delicious. When we walked out one of the servers bussing tables even yelled thank you to us, which just seems out of the ordinary for a Fast Casual location."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh food.  Love this place.  For a 'fast food' type place...this beats most Mexican Food Restaurants around Scottsdale.  My family have been here several times, as it has become a favorite, and we've always had a nice experience.  Beans and rice always are fresh and hot.  The Chicken taquitos (combo) are great.  I like that they do not drown/cover everything in cheese like many other Mexican food restaurants.  My only complaint during one visit was that their Horchata did not taste fresh.  Other than that, it's a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrific. I placed an order for a party platter that was shown on the online menu to come with several sides. When I picked up the order and asked for the items included on the menu I was told the platter did not come with those sides. I explained the menu shows those items are included and when I called to place my order no one advised me the menu had changed. I was rudely told the menu was incorrect and I would not be receiving my sides. I later called to speak with the General Manager to discuss my customer service concerns and they would not speak with me. They had the day manger tell me the menu is wrong but if I wanted to drive back they would give me my sides. This was an hour after I had picked up my order.  No apology for their error or service.  I will not be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Great place for good fresh quick lunch. Some of the best flavors we have had in the area. Hands down - the best guacamole we've had in years. Hey we are from Texas and we know our Mexican food. Good atmosphere , clean , friendly staff. We made sure we told the manager how satisfied we were. Our family is in the area so WE will be back."}
{"text":"Seems like a really popular neighborhood place.  I'm not a big fan of this style of Mexican food.  Chopped iceberg lettuce on or with everything is not very appealing to me because it doesn't have much flavor, and the heat from the dish makes it wilt. Okay for a quick and easy lunch though."}
{"text":"Today was the grand opening and had heard on the local news there were free burritos all day! Sadly it was only for first 100 people. Sad day.   But still decided to get a shredded chicken chimichanga and margarita! They also gave us chips and salsa with our meal.   Overall the food was average. The chicken didn't have any taste so I had to add a lot of salsa. But it did come with lettuce, guac, and sour cream.   The margaritas were okay. A little sweet for me and not very strong.   The atmosphere however is great! They did an awesome job decorating. It was nice and clean!   If I get another craving for Mexican food I might just stop by again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Mexican food, I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! They have really great Mexican food! I LOVE the breakfast burritos. They are the perfect ratio of tortillas to ingredients, meaning they are perfect in size.....they aren't so huge you can only eat 1/3. I love the enchiladas, tacos, beans, and rice. This place is also very convenient as well as you can call ahead and pick up food in the drive thru line!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid little lunch spot! Reasonable prices meant I could totally pig out, so I got the albondigas soup and chicken enchiladas and really enjoyed both. They even have Mexican coke which is worth a star in and of itself! Pretty darn busy at about noon though - seating can be a bit tight."}
{"text":"Someburro's is a great place to grab an inexpensive meal when you are too tired to make anything and/or feel like having a big satisfying mexican meal. You can call in your meal ahead of time and tt has a drive thru if you're really feeling lazy. I like Someburro's when I feel like having a fatty, lazy meal - you can deep fry whatever you order for $1 more.   - Veggie Burrito: This baby comes double wrapped (yes, TWO giant tortillas) and is filled with beans, cheese, and their very good guacamole salsa. I really like the guac-salsa more than the regular guacamole. The guac-salsa is literally guacamole mixed with pico de gallo and somehow the combination is better than the two parts. I get this enchilada style with the red sauce, which is really really good enchilada sauce. It is very creamy and thick and has a very yummy flavor. - Cheese Enchiladas: Not as good as the enchilada-style veggie burrito (I think) but passable. Definitely get the meal version because the enchiladas themselves are on the small side. - Rice & Beans: Nothing special here, just standard average orange rice and refried beans."}
{"text":"We are regulars at this place....either place...Scottsdale or Mesa. Both locations are dependably good in their service, food quality and cleanliness.    Great for families, couples, whatever.... Outside dining (mist system when its hot) and pretty good prices.  All around a good place to go anytime."}
{"text":"Bean burrito, extra cheese.  Side of rice.  I have dined at Someburros for a huge chunk of my life (15 years?), and only once have I ordered anything different than that which is listed.  They're exceptionally generous with the cheese when ordered like this and the beans have tasted exactly the same (good) throughout the years.  There's a consistency at Someburros that is to be admired, for sure.  I am especially fond of this location on Baseline and Mill in Tempe.  Being a hop, skip, and a jump away from Kiwanis Park, there is little better than a breezy Sunday playing basketball and later venturing a block down the road for some great American Mexican food."}
{"text":"You have to love the shredded beef tacos and the pollo fundido.  This place has one of the best shredded beef tacos in town and the hot sauce is a perfect compliment to the tacos."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of deep fried tacos. Hated it.   Don't waste your time.  Glorified fast food.  Blah."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. If it's not spicy enough just order it spicier next time."}
{"text":"I'm out in the field alot for my job....so you can guess that if I am anywhere near a Someburros I will stop for the Vegi burrito.  Fresh avocado, pinto beans, onions (which I really can't eat, but will), fresh pico....wrapped in a fresh tortilla with salsa is oh so yummy!  So anytime I think, oh goodness, I've got to drive to Tempe or Gilbert, I think, hey I can stop at Someburros for my Vegi burro...it suddenly brings a smile to my face :-)"}
{"text":"The horchaitas are the best ive tasted... So far."}
{"text":"this place is amazing. the food and drinks were great but the real 5 Star part of this establishment walks the on 2 feet standing 5' 8\" at roughly 174 pounds named Tyler! he was so great to me and my group while we were attending this restaurant. overall food good Tyler GREAT! Oh and almost forgot, Ernest. a nice gentlemen that and i quote \"i got you guys\"."}
{"text":"When you move away from the town you grew up in, you inevitably have a favorite food that you can't find in your new city.   I miss the hell out of Someburro's shredded beef chimichangas.  Fried crispy shell, slightly spicy red sauce, juicy shredded beef, and cool sour cream is my perfect meal.  I don't need any beans or rice to take up space in my stomach; I need all the stomach room I can find because the chimichanga is huge.    I was recently back in AZ and the first place I went to eat was the Someburro's that is down the street from where I grew up.   I was instantly put into a state of bliss with my first bite; it was just as good as I had built it up in my head.   Sure I was stuffed after I was done, but I had to finish it since I only get one every couple of years. Thank you Someburro's for being consistently good all of these years!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome & the staff is really friendly too!  Alex has great customer service, always smiling!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a co-worker. It was pretty good. For about $6 I got a burrito and an Horchata, which I think is a pretty good value. But... There is just something about it that was just \"Okay.\"  Pros: - Burrito was pretty good. It was the Chorizo/Egg breakfast variety. - They're little packs of complimentary salsa was really good for some reason.  Cons: - Tastes like other American Mexican Food places--like Macayo's/Arriba's/etc. It just didn't have a \"Mexican\" taste (maybe I'm being picky here since I eat Mexican food almost every day.) - CARDINAL SIN: Horchata had a funky after taste. I still drank all of it, but made a face of disappointment afterward.  I might go back, I just wouldn't rave about it to my friends."}
{"text":"AlawYs a five star visit. The food is wonderful and friendly faces. One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and clean. There is not many people at around 4pm on a Wednesday and it's happy hour! I got an order of nachos that were different from what I expected, but surprisingly good. If you don't want to fill yourself of chips, this is a great vegetarian option. I will definitely come back here to try other things."}
{"text":"Great place!  The Crudo Burro is VERY hot.  But it was great.  Wonderful service, great \"cheap\" Mexican food, and good fruity tea.  My wife and I were very pleased.  We'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I've never noticed this place until today. So glad I came in for lunch. It was packed which suggested that I made a good decision. My son ordered the borracho burro and I ordered the crudo burro. Both were delicious!  This is definitely a new favorite for me."}
{"text":"This Someburros just opened. It is clean and sleek. The counter guy was friendly. Got a veggie burro with green sauce. The food was solid. Nice to have something better than Taco Bell close to the office. They don't have the online orders down yet. 30 minutes after placing my order and 8 minutes after the scheduled pick up and my order wasn't ready. It was pretty clear it hadn't even need started it when I arrived--I was told \"it didn't go through on the system.\" Finally got food 43 minutes later and 13 minutes after I physically showed up. I do think they rushed the order, but I could have placed an order in person and gotten it more quickly. No apology. Nothing offered to maKe up for the inconvenience. People order in advance because they are in a hurry, FYI."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I expected when I came in here. This is a pretty casual burrito joint, where you order first and they bring the food to you. It's not as \"gourmet\" as Chipolte tries to be and is likely closer to authentic Mexican food than specialty food.  Again, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I did like the special that I ordered. The portions have a decent size to them, too."}
{"text":"So I was in here with my sister for dinner this evening and she is a little special. She ordered her new first and then I ordered mine. We sat down and somehow her order got lost or something (not sure) but mine came out first. They finally brought hers out and we ate. It was good and then she wanted to order food to take to her son. As we were waiting, the guy who originally took our order started talking about my sister (we were within ear shot) and they were laughing.  I know she isn't the easiest person to deal with but don't talk shit about my sister!!!"}
{"text":"Way too much tortilla to meat ratio on my chimichanga.  Last few times I have been there the food was \"less than\".  Less meat especially.   Chips were all flopped together and not separated when cooked so you had to pry them apart when you eat them.   So they all fell apart into little tiny pieces.   Not in a big hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I like to go through the drive thru, but i have eaten inside before as well. If you are inside they give you lots of chips, on the to go orders ,no. I got the green chili bean and cheese burro with rice and beans.  It is ok ,not the best. But it is very  cheap.       It is a quick meal when you are on the go.    I would rather have spicy and tasty, however i am sure i will go there again at some point."}
{"text":"We love this place and frequent often. Pollo Fundido is one of our favorites. I also enjoy the fish tacos.  Fresh food great service.  I would have given 5 stars except the ladies bathroom smells SO BAD...Every time!!! I like to wash my hands before I eat, but bring sanitizer. As using the bathroom I lose my appetite. I did suggested to management to use a room freshener...They haven't yet."}
{"text":"Not a  fan. Filabertos is definately a whole lot better and has better prices."}
{"text":"Got info on the tortillas, they are full of lard and trans fat. So for anyone concerned with living with a healthy heart, please be warned.  Still love the salsa! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, quality and affordable food. Definitely my new place when I'm craving Mexican food. I like the fact that they serve white meat chicken with their plates."}
{"text":"Excellent! Loved everything about the place ! Delicious food and outstanding customer service! 5 star for me."}
{"text":"My mom is obsessed with this place, I think mostly because of the huge bags of tortilla chips that she eats for days but anywho the only thing I ever order from here is the chicken or cheese red sauce enchiladas with rice and beans. I do looooove it and sometimes if I'm in the mood for their meat quesadilla/cheese crisp. Other than that I don't really like anything else. Their little containers of red salsa is eh and the large container of chunky red salsa is so gross! I don't know why my mom orders that too all the time but it's flavorless and it just has the wrong ingredients for red salsa. I gave it a 4 star because I love my same exact meal every single time."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican food and it's so inexpensive. Great service and friendly  Workers."}
{"text":"Very rude staff on drive through. Today they had a bean and cheese burrito for 2.50. I requested no cheese and they told me I had to pay FULL price! Prior to this they had messed up on three of my orders all on separate occasions. They don't give you chips to go but if you request some they will give you a small bag for free!! But be prepared for attitude when you do ask. I've given this place several chances and have overlooked the staffs rudeness, but today telling me I had to pay full price to omit the cheese was ridiculous and I will no longer go to this location!!"}
{"text":"We get pick orders from here at least once a week and the food is always consistently good. The staff is friendly and if there is ever a mistake we call and the situation is rectified. Great example of a customers first attitude and a quality product!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I've had mini chimis in chicken and bean, Both are great! The tortillas are amazing, and the chorizo burrito is very yummy. My fiancee had the Carne Asada burrito and a beef tamale. The burrito was very good but he wont get another tamale there, the masa to filling ratio is very heavy on the masa and light on the beef (also beef filling has olives in it)  Some of the staff is lacking in service but overall I will definitely make this a regular food stop, probably mostly by phone orders and pickup. The web ordering is not quite there yet when adding an item to your order it has a space for special notes but does not allow you to type anything into it.  Location pluses: The last time I was there I saw that you can get free food (up to 10$) for your birthday. They have 2$ taco Tuesdays, and a drive through is available for called-in and online orders."}
{"text":"Decent mexican food.  It is pretty good when you need a change from Chipotle.  Good deals, good food."}
{"text":"I was looking for some good Mexican food and found someburros on yelp so my family went there for dinner. The food was good, but my fiancee and daughter end up getting possibly food positioning. They were up all night and the next day in the bathroom."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better. I would come in from DC and my whole family would go here and get copious amounts of tacos. They are decent but with so much competition you need to stand out to survive.   The beef tacos were ok but lacked serious flavor. The breakfast burrito was uninspired and was kind of soggy. The green chile salsa was very bland as well.   The portions are large and the normal salsa is quite tasty but overall there is better Mex to be had."}
{"text":"I stopped in today on a whim after a Trader Joe's visit. I was impressed by how clean and organized it was inside! Maybe all the construction that had been going on had me associating it with dirt, but there was none to be found!   Due to a lunch hour time crunch, I automatically opted for the daily special- a Boracho Burrito and large drink. For 8 bucks I was impressed by the quality:  The chips were standard issue corn and the salsa was in a little squirt bottle that the cashier got out of a fridge behind the counter. It was blended instead of chunky-which I find muy bueno.  There were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito, a ton of cheese on top, extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side. Definitely a solid, inexpensive meal. I will hit it up again for sure.   *For some reason it got me thinking about one of my fave college days hangouts- Two Peso's! Except they dont have a guy yelling \"Two-FEEFTY-four, nomber twoFEEFTYfour\" when your order is up. Loved that. **That was totally irrelevant, but it felt good."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving this place 4 stars is well I found absolutely nothing wrong with this place. The tables,floors,counter, kitchen area all clean.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a drive up window for phone and online orders. They had Mexican music playing in the background. If you were eating there they give you chips and salsa for the table and bring you your meal. The salsa was good and the breakfast burrito I had was great! All in all good place to get a burrito or Mexican meal. I will be going back.  The reason for the 4 stars also I only had one thing. It's hard to mess up a burrito. But I will be updating when I try something else."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some Mexican food that's well priced, good portions and full of hungry customers.  Owners are Arizonan locals which always make things better."}
{"text":"Okay, so, my best of friends lived next door to this place for a couple years and would always tell me that Someburros was just \"Okay\" at best. On the weekend before they move away, I come to visit and they finally take me here. I feel like my friends were holding out on me, Someburros is delicious."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, it's been hard to find what we consider good Mexican food. This place is absolutely the best we've found so far (& we've tried a lot of places)! It is counter service, but the restaurant area is very nicely appointed. The staff is great! You've got to try the Chicken Fundito!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Someburros, I have been coming here for a long time and I am sure that some of how I feel about this place is that it holds good memories for me. They are always friendly here, it is casual, and you can just sit and talk and eat chips."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service in the drive through pick up. Woman was very rude and it doesn't take 10 minutes to get salsa that is already packaged and a bag of chips.... especially when the store is empty. Good thing the food is good"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Someburros finally opened up its North Scottsdale location; I used to live down the street from the Tempe location. It's a great place to get a quick Mexican bite that has better ingredients than a \"bertos\" style joint. The size of the burritos is not ginormous, but that's because you're paying for better and fresher ingredients. Fresher ingredients play a big part in compensating on the slightly smaller portions, but they boost the overall flavors and I can't complain about that. For around $6 I had lunch and didn't leave hungry.  The Scottsdale Air Park now has another good Mexican restaurant (Habenero's being the other) that will leave its customers full and content. Expect me here for lunch pretty often."}
{"text":"Food's always pretty good here. Service is always pretty good here. Prices are very reasonable. I like taking the family out here for a decent Mexican meal."}
{"text":"My sister LOVES Someburros so today while shopping, I decided to stop by for some Mexican food \"to-go\". It was day 2 since their grand opening but since I heard so much about it, I had to go. The line was obviously long, but worth it. Food was great. I ordered the chicken fundido which came with rice and it was only $5 (it wa their special for the day). Had to pay an extra $1.50 for chips (boo). Ordered a cheese burger for my son, it was large and in charge. I would for sure go back....  The only gripe is that people who are waiting for food \"to go\" kinda lingers around the front because there really isn't anywhere for us to go and wait without taking up table space for people eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"At least one a week. Can't go wrong.   My family's favorite chips & hot sauce anywhere.  Wife loves the veggie burro."}
{"text":"Great prices. My daughter and I ate there for $12 and walked out stuffed. It's definitely not authentic Mexican but it is still good. I got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco. Both were fantastic for the money. The only knock on the place I have is that it was 90* in the dining room so I just took my food to go."}
{"text":"All time favorite restaurant. I have never had a bad experience with someburros and may I mention they are very affordable. I recommend their burritos and enchiladas. Also they don't have it on the menu but you can still order it is open faced cheese crisp. Please check it out if your around."}
{"text":"I've been eating at someburros almost my whole life, and It's always been my favorite mexican food place The food just seems so homemade to me instead of generic like most of the other mexican places. This location is great & very close to my place, but my favorite will always be the original location in Tempe! :)."}
{"text":"We have been going there for many years. They are consistent with a great staff. Buros are of course great but be sure to check out the Mexican pizza especially with chicken or beef. Take out is great but be sure to call ahead to order. Every time we have done this our order is waiting when we get there. They use good ingredients and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had tacos here and the meat was really dry. The beans are good but I wouldn't recommend this place. They had good service it's just the food that wasn't that tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered our food with a very annoyed girl that rolled her eyes as we tried to order and wasn't in the slightest bit helpful. I most certainly get better service at any Taco Bell in the Valley. Paid 16 bucks for two SMALL burros with no chips, no drinks, no sides, nothing.   Our to-go food took forever. At least 4 tables that came in after us got their food and started eating before we left. When our order was ready a girl came up and basically mic dropped our food onto the counter and yelled our name then walked away. I grabbed the food and wanted to ask about chips but despite the 7 girls \"working\" the front counter no one acknowledged me till I felt awkward and just left.   What a mess. I don't even know if the food tastes bad or I'm just too annoyed to enjoy it.   + 1 star because my girlfriend says \"I am equally annoyed but the deliciousness is diffusing the situation.\"   Won't be back."}
{"text":"If i could rate the food and service separate, the food would be 4 1/2 stars and the service 1 star. When we moved to the area, I was so excited to be fairly close to a someburros cause I love the food. The first time we visited, the girl at the register barely acknowledged our presence, let alone looked up at us, as we ordered. When we pointed it out to the manager on duty he apologized, and we were treated better.  However, the young lady was upset and glared at us our entire meal. In the end we wrote it off as a one time, bad day.  The second time we came, they got my order wrong and when I had the nerve to ask for it to be corrected, I was greeted with annoyance.  Once again I pointed this out to the manager on duty and he apologized profusely.  This time we walked away with a gift card.  The next time we came in, I of course used the gift card and the manager recognized me. I can assume that is why that visit went off without a hitch.   However, this time proved to be the breaking point. My birthday was a week ago. I tell you this because I got an email from them today regarding their new birthday special. Since my birthday was a week ago I assumed it was one of the regular emails were they were offering me a free entree because it was my birthday and it was just late. However, as we learned from the  rude manager on duty, we read it wrong, and it was only an informational email,  and therefore we would not be getting any discount. At no point, did the manager apologize for the misunderstanding or try to hide her irritation that I did misunderstand.  Customer service is a huge part of my eating out experience.  It's why i don't eat at fast food restaurants often.   As I told the manger, there are plenty of  places to get good Mexican food  around there, so we won't be going to Someburros again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Counter service.  You order and the food is delivered to your table.  Each customer gets a paper bowl of tortilla chips.  I don't know if I was lucky or if the chips are always DELICIOUS.  I ordered the veggie burrito and it was just okay.  Nothing special about it and I had to add salt to give it flavor.  In a Mexican restaurant?!?!"}
{"text":"Someburros is Amazing if you are ever in a hurry and want fast but delicious and authentic Mexican food then look no further! The pollo fundido is huge and delicious the carne asada very authentic and the chorrizo is my personal favorite you can get it in almost anything!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Someburros in Flagstaff. Why, you may ask?  Because on the way into Flagstaff, there's this really big billboard sign that reminds you that mexican food awaits you as you pull into town.  We weren't impressed with the offering there. Therefore, I am not sure why we even ventured to try their location in Tempe.   We wound up in this area because we were visiting Kiwanis Park for some Pokemon hunting. And after the hours long travail throughout the park, we were famished enough to settle for the nearest sustenance station.  It was a Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed. The parking is dreadful as there aren't a lot of spaces right by the restaurant. Therefore, you have to park all the way around the corner.  When you go inside, you'll notice that there aren't a lot of tables, either. If there are, the bussers haven't actually put the food away. If you want a seat, then you'll have to clean it yourself.  The food is just slightly a step up from Taco Bell, and that isn't saying much. Our Burrito had pieces of meat that were undercooked, to the point that it tasted raw. The lettuce was questionable in its freshness. And the cheese didn't taste quite right.  Our taco had the same strange meat consistency. And the after taste of the lard that they used left a really bad aftertaste in our mouths.  The only saving grace was the freshly made tortilla chips. They were really fresh and light. And the salsa was also freshly made.   All in all, the main courses were dreadful, and the appetizers were more than passable. Hence, the two star rating, that assures us that we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not sold on this place.  Nothin here \"wow\"s me like Arriba or other places.    I tend to avoid this place as well, because everytime I have tried it this place is PACKED with kids!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for good Mexican restaurants since we moved here last year. We have gotten food from here a few times now. There are pros and cons. They have a drive thru which we have used every time to get our food which is nice and convenient. I have only ever had their cheese enchiladas which I do like. My husband likes their taquitos. Their rice is also good. What I don't like about this place is that they charge you for tortilla chips AND they charge you a separate price for salsa (hot sauce)(for to-go orders at least). Perhaps it is because we have only done to-go orders, but the chips have always been cold and in need of a lot of salt, and that is saying a lot for me because I am not a fan of salty food.  I would recommend giving them a try, but if you taking it to go, buy your own bag of chips."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great for kids, gentle atmosphere. Brought our family here for lunch after a Saturday outing in Scottsdale. I had veggie burro and my wife ordered nachos. Kids had a la carte pintos and rice, cheese crisp kids meal. Chips and homemade salsa is addictive. Very friendly staff, nice and clean, and an excellent value at about $22/all told. Everyone left satisfied. Kids ask all the time to go to Some Burros!"}
{"text":"Someburros has this dish called \"Pollo Fundido\" which is basically a deep-fried chicken burro slathered in their \"spicy cream cheese\" mixture.  It's so bad (for you), and sooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend ordering it with refried beans on the side instead of the standard rice."}
{"text":"Since I'm pretty much disabled I really appreciate drive thru's more than just \"convenience sake\", so there ONE salsa per item truly sucks. My only option is to buy an 8 oz salsa and that doesn't include chips. If I were able bodied... I could go inside and get my salsa free... WTH.  Guess what?? I went to my other favorite Mexican place just because of the principle. I had to struggle to get in, but it was still to go and I got PLENTY of salsa without the charge."}
{"text":"I would come here again for sure! I had an enchilada and a taco and both were really good. I went here based on other peoples reviews and I was very happy. Awesome horchata as well ! :)"}
{"text":"I called and placed an order for 2 veggie burros because I'm a vegetarian got about a third of the way into one and there was MEAT in it. Also a veggie burro is suppose to have cheese which it did not and fresh avocados in it but instead it had the pico de avocado and they did not tell me this would be substituted. Just ended up throwing them away. Also the first time I called a girl named Hailey answered the phone but said the wrong address and then said \"wait what\" and hung up on me so I had to call again and a different employee answered the phone. Very disappointed in this Someburros location. The one at 101 E. Baseline Rd. in Tempe is much better!"}
{"text":"This place is hard to beat in value. It's not your average \"seat yourself\" type of place.  I liked the food very much, and will return when I'm in the mood for a quick Mexican food fix on this side of town."}
{"text":"The pollo fundido always seems to be the special when I go in. Always great. Lunch time is crazy so be prepaired but what great restraunt isnt."}
{"text":"Being a native Phoenician, I have a junkie like addiction to mexican food.  I find Someburros to be quite satisfying.  It is not a _bertos clone, so don't go expecting carne asada like you're used to.  It has a more authentic menu, that isn't all that authentic, but more so than _bertos.  The Pollo Fundido is indeed delectable and decadent.  The three way burro is scrumptious and may I suggest a cheese crisp with green chiles, which is my personal fav.    It's a bit more pricey than _bertos, but well worth it.  Call in your order and they have a pick up window.  You can't beat convenience."}
{"text":"This place is consistent, friendly and clean.  Love the food, music is authentic, just wish they served a mild salsa for chips."}
{"text":"Idk what these poor reviews are about. I love the staff and the food is on point. They are always gracious, even at 9am when I show up. I grew up eating nothing but Mexican food. The borracho burro is a must try if you like green chili.  I come here almost every Thursday. Definitely a good weekly treat. Also, the place looks fantastic since the remodel."}
{"text":"I love the pollo fundido and baraccho burrito. Super no frills, yummy Mexican food. Decent prices. Clean and quick, lots of choices. Go for 5 dollar fundido Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high, but the flavors are good. I recommend the red enchilada's."}
{"text":"Saw the article about the \"magical\" burrito and decided to finally try this place.  It seems a tad pricey for what seems to be a taco shop, but the employees were friendly and I am guessing by the amount of time it took to receive my order that they are all made to order.  The main issue that I had was I had also gotten 2 chorizo, egg, potato  burritos and added cheese, can't really recall any potatoes, but there sure were A LOT of egg shells in my burrito.  The Fundido burrito was pretty good, better with their hot sauce, and the chicken chimi with red sauce was good."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is definitely the appropriate comment for this place.  The food was OK at best.  The best thing I had was the beans and hot sauce.  I ordered a shredded chicken burrito combo.  Although I was happy to see that the burrito wasn't bigger than my head (seriously, why do places serve such HUGE burritos?), I wasn't happy with much else.  The chicken was watery (literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - gross) and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was bland.  The beans were tasty, especially with LOTS of hot sauce/salsa on them.  Can't say I'll be coming back.  I'll be looking for some burros elsewhere, thank you very much."}
{"text":"We stop at this location when we are in town.  For fast food it is very good.  The have a fairly large menu, which give you some variety.  My favorite is the ground beef and potato burrito.  They also offer a nice kids menu, and our kids enjoy the food as well!  It can get busy, but they do a good job of getting food out quickly.  If you are in the area give them a try!"}
{"text":"I would probably come here every day if I could. I love the variety of options. The rice and beans are so good that I usually end up getting an order of them to-go after I finish eating. I love that you get chips while you wait even though it is not a sit-down-and-order restaurant although I'd like some spicier sauce. The environment is very welcoming and... frozen margaritas. You know you want one."}
{"text":"I expected more due to the glowing reviews here on Yelp I got the Pollo Fundido It wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't the best Pollo Fundido ever.  I thought the salsa was good, but a little too thin.  I would have liked to have a chunkier option as well.  The ambiance was flourescent and a bit cheesy.  I dunno, I just thought that I'd really be wowed by the food, and I'm a bit disappointed.  Oh well :("}
{"text":"Someburros may be my favorite Mexican place in Tempe. The enchilada I had was very good and the refried beans excellent. The shredded chicken and shredded beef in tacos were very good as well. My reason for really, really recommending Someburros is the honesty of the staff. After finishing our lunch and trying to manage busing the table and assisting my 91-year-old mother I left my New 32 gig iPad on our table. After realizing my mistake fifteen minutes later and returning to the restaurant a staff person smilingly assured me he had it. So I had a very tasty lunch and my faith in the kindness and honesty in people restored at the same time. Thank You Someburros! You are a great organization."}
{"text":"Someburros ROCKS!  I love their chips and salsa - it's more of a hot sauce.  The best thing on the menu if you are eating in is the nachos - they are not standard nachos but they are delicious!  For take out, I like a bean and cheese burrito!  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had the Machaca Chimichanga ($7.85). It was a good sized portion with a crispy deep fried tortilla and tender tasty shredded beef inside. The green sauce was mild and the sour cream and shredded lettuce was scant and not enough to have some with the entire chimi.   The meal comes with complementary chips. It is a small paper container filled with what looks and tastes like store bought chips that have been slightly warmed. They also provide a ketchup dispenser filled with what tastes like Taco Bell hot sauce. I assumed that this was \"salsa\" for the chips. Not a fan of the sauce, so just used the chips for scooping up some of the shredded beef that had fallen out of the chimi.  Service is more fast food than sit-down. You go to the counter to order and pay. You round up your own silverware, straws, napkins, and so forth. The meal is brought to your table once it is ready. There are tables and chairs. The restaurant is clean and the staff seems friendly. Parking is plentiful and close to the door.  Above average for fast food (definitely much better than a Taco Bell), but not quite to the level of a sit down Sonoran Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Atkins and South Beach diets say eat more red meat if you want to be thin.  Harvard Medical School says to eat more red meat if you want to be dead.  Implicitly, this means my new weight-loss goal should be somewhere between thin and dead, and since I tend to lean more toward thin, I'm going with dead.   And here's how. Someburros' crudo burrito, sans the tortilla. Order a side of crudo for $3.25, and if Harvard is right, you'll be dead in no time, this despite it's deliciously marinated beef smothered in spicy tomatillo sauce.  Yes, if South Beach and Atkins are good weight loss programs, you'll be in that banana hammock in less than a month, grossing-out all the girls poolside.  Well fuck you Harvard Medical. As if I'm going to listen to anything you say about red meat or any other fucking thing. I'll bet you guys never even looked at my entrance application...did you?  Do you know what a lousy lib arts degree from Phoenix College gets you?  Can you say nada?  Or don't you waste your precious researcher's time studying relationships between rejected Harvard applicants and how fucked their lives eventually become?  Perhaps you should, because if you did, you'd know how my life is a steaming pile of dogshit, and how my eating red meat and dying is the least of my concerns at this point.   Arrghh"}
{"text":"This has strangely become my new favorite Mexican restaurant. I never came in before because I thought it was fast food, but it was really authentic and good Mexican food at a great price. The salsa is addicting. Pollo fundido for $8.50 was better than I have had at high end restaurants. The tacos are very good as well. This is now 1st on my rotation."}
{"text":"Deplorable really.  The food made me sick.  I would rather have Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine way to satisfy that on again off again craving for that bastardized Mexican food that we've grown up with.  Nothing outside of the standards that you'll get at Julio G's, TeePee, Macayo's or anywhere else but nicely executed and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I go there at least once a week (sometimes more) for lunch.  The food is very tasty and yes they serve real beans (not the canned stuff)!!!!!!  The Carne Asada Burro is one of my favs.  Staff is friendly and offers fast convient service.  If you haven't stopped in yet, I would suggest you put it on your TO DO List :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here and I lve that this location is close to ASU. What a great business move to add a location here. Food and service is consistently good. Restaurant is clean and much less crowded than the Tempe Baseline location during lunch. I bet once the ASU students realize how amazing the food is, it will be hard to get a seat at lunch.   My salad was the daily special. It was less than $10 including a drink and really fresh. There was plenty of avocado in it. Many restaurants skimp on avocado but these guys don't. I've also had the chimichanga with chicken with red sauce and OMG it was huge.   Parking is in the rear and there is a good amount compared to other establishments on the area. There is also a drive through in case you're still in your pj's and need to eat quick! (This is for students who may be getting up late!)  I plan to eat here often as I connect with my former work crew."}
{"text":"I hate to do this. I remember coming here 25 years ago and loving the green burrito so it's kind of cool that it's still around at the same location. Yesterday I had the special tostada and cheese enchilada. It tasted good. One thing I noticed was the salsa wasn't very cold but I ate a ton of it anyway because our food took a long time.   The problem is that I have been running to the bathroom continuously for the last 24 hours. I don't feel poisoned just a lot of trips to the toilet. If the owners read this I ask that they review the sanitation policies at their restaurant and see if it can be improved."}
{"text":"I give the FOOD here 5 stars......They have EXCELLENT red chile burros, excellent beans,  the salsa is a little too hot, i wish they had  a mild one (like Macayos) The service is ok, i don't see them winning any congeniality contests  in near future, but hey.....the FOOD rocks.  Sometimes when it is good, you have to  lower your customer service expectations. This place is one of my guilty pleasures........I never get tired of it. If they put their employees through Quik Trip employee training it would be ABSOLUTELY PERFECT  as opposed to being just PERFECT. Some of the girls that work there are drop dead gorgeous and the guy that manages, the tall Hispanic guy......LORD, it is worth going JUST to see that big Hunk of a man.  SO the customer service is ahhhahhh....but the food and view make up for it in a BIG way."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, and friendly staff. This is the only Mexican restaurant we go to anymore. We bring our out of guests here and tell everyone. They make us feel like family. The salsa, tortillas and beans are all homemade."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other night. Ordered to go and was really surprised when I got to the restaurant and the line was just about to the door. I ordered a bean tostada, rice & beans and the vegetable salsa and guacamole. The bean tostada was not impressive at all. Very plain. But, everything else delicious. I loved the salsa. I will definitely try something they're more known for next time."}
{"text":"Not great... Taco salad was not pleasing and the steak tacos were small and not satisfying. I guess maybe we were supposed to order a burrito or something. Still searching for good Mexican in tempe. We won't be back here that's for sure."}
{"text":"I've been going to Someburros over 20 years. It's standard \"Americanized\" Sonoran Mexican food, but it's tasty and quick. Their salsa is ok - not spicy enough for my taste, but it's much better than anything I get in Las Vegas. At least there's a little bit of heat. It's definitely a step up from Taco Bell, but that's about it. Their carne asada street taco's are probably the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid. Everything I have ever tried was great. Would highly recommend trying it out. Great hot sauce although don't eat a whole bottle because you will pay for it later !"}
{"text":"I trust this Mexican restaurant, I have a hard time at unknown corner Mexican taco shops, this restaurant is clean the ingredients are fresh and they are very friendly,,I highly recommend the breakfast burritos,"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since my jobless just moved out here from CA and don't want to go to college just yet days.  The quality of the food has remained consistent throughout the years.  I have had everything on the menu at least twice.  The chips are always fresh, the salsa is spicy but not to bad, the burritos are great (even the red sauce ones, and I don't like red sauce), the staff is always polite.  They open at 10:30 AM, so, its a little difficult to say its \"breakfast\" food, but yeah, I guess I could eat this for breakfast.  They do have a \"drive up\" window - but its for phone orders only!"}
{"text":"Ran by before work to give this place a try and and get some breakfast burritos quickly but was told it would take 10 to 15 minutes! What??!!  Never mind!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Someburros for years now, but I have never come to this location and I must say I was disgusted with my whole experience when I ordered my food tonight.  First off, I ordered my food online, and I showed up 10 minutes early just so they could tell me that they never saw my order. They asked me to wait in the parking lot so they could bring my food out to me when it was finished. 35 minutes later, the lady I spoke to brought my food out and handed me a 15$ gift card wrapped in an envelope and said \"this is for waiting, have a good night.\"  I was angry but I was hungry so I let it go. I got home with the food to eat with my family and started to pull out the food from the bag. Not only did they forget to put in a part of my order, but the food was disgusting, soggy, and cold. Again, I let it go as I figured they were busy for taco Tuesday night. While we were eating, my mom yelled \"ow!\" And pulled out a full toothpick that was laying sideways inside her taco. My dad called the manager right away and she was short, rude and didn't offer any type of solution, but insisted that everything they had done wrong was alright because she \"gave me a gift card for waiting\".  I was uterly disgusted with the food and the horrible customer service and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away from this location. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good Mexican food. First, I have to say that I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT GOOD MEXICAN FOOD IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE. I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley of Southern California, and I've had A LOT of Mexifood. I'm not bragging, I've just been tricked into trying a lot of sub-standard stuff out here in the valley by reading artificially high reviews written by people who must think Taco Bell and the Frito Bandito actually have something to do with Mexican food..   I had seen Some Burros for a while now, and resisted going in because I don't eat donkey :) Seriously tho, I don't know why they aren't called Burritos, because the \"burros\" I've had out here are smaller than what we call \"burritos\" in SoCal...but I digress.   THE FOOD HERE IS GREAT. It's fresh. It's prepared well, it's THE REAL DEAL. The salsas are OUTSTANDING. From a value perspective, It beats the hell out of any fancy mexican food I've had in the many cute cantinas with 20 kinds of margaritas.   I've had their tacos, their basic bean and cheese burros, their Borracho Burro (outstanding) their Pollo Fundido (good, but not really my thing) and again THOSE SALSAS. You could put some of their salsa on a brick and it would taste good. Most importantly: Everything I've had has been prepared FRESH with FRESH ingredients and IT'S CHEAP!!   Bottom line if you value the holy trinity in great Mexican food PRICE + FRESHNESS + FLAVOR, then SOME BURROS will hit a home run with you too. I've only just started my journey on the Some Burros menu, but I'm looking forward to trying a whole lot more. I'll be sure to update this review with other outstanding choices after I try them."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is cute and has a good atmosphere. The food is fine, not super amazing but good. They only have one cashier, thus making for an unwieldy line. I won't be back but it's worth a try for yourself simply because it is so conveniently located."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Simple as that.  I usually order the Pollo Fundido, which is fantastic. The chips and salsa are very good, too. The chips could be a bit better, but you get what you pay for, right?  The staff is very friendly and the woman who busses the tables should receive a promotion for how helpful she is.  Would 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh Someburros...you are better in my memory than in real life...but Oh what memories.... When I was in high school and lived in AZ my best friends and I would get Someburros all the time...it was where the entire universe was discussed and unfolded. Sometimes we would just get chips and salsa to go, but being there was better. Recently, I had Someburros on a trip to Phoenix, and was able to introduce my husband and baby to the joy that is Someburros. Not much has changed. I still love their salsa, which is really an amazing hot sauce. See...as soon as I get back to MN I dream about it! Things I love include the cheese enchiladas, the chicken burrito, and more recently, the chicken burrito with jalepeno cream cheese. But really, it's all good. And cheap. And a thousand times better for your memory and well-being than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Gross.  I love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.  No flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money."}
{"text":"I grew up with eating Someburros, when it was only available in Tempe (so keep that in mind).. I am a native of Arizona and always have to stop to get my \"comfort food\" meal in when I come back to visit. It's fast food, yes. But I do think that it is actually quite good for being what it is!! The prices are not too expensive, either. I do love their bean burritos, tacos, salads, and so much more here. By no means have I tried even half of the stuff on the menu, but I can honestly say that I have never had something that I didn't really enjoy here! (And the spicy salsa is so good, too!!)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this spot since I was a kid. It is almost \"comfort\" food for me!  I have always had great service, and the food has been very good, too. It is great for a \"fast food\" type place. Great for groups, and not too pricey. I definitely suggest this place to anyone. Everyone that I have recommended Someburros to, has loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for over 4 years at this location but had a horrible experience during my last visit. I was told that I would halve to pay for the complimentary chips that I had been getting free every single time I have gone before. I was also charged an additional 50 cents for extra lettuce GARNISH, but when I got my order, there was LESS garnish than normal. Of all things, the manager was the one to take my order and deliver my food! She was not accommodating and did not make any effort to better the situation which was very disappointing. She should do a better job of catering to the customer, making sure they leave happy instead of nickel and diming the customer on 100% complimentery items. Definitely will try to avoid Jennifer next time I am in. The other employees are always really great and helpful!"}
{"text":"Was not happy with my experience here. I had ordered some food to go on my lunch break today. When I picked it up, my beef taco was completely cold. I was incredibly disappointed and felt the food was extremely over priced for what it was (bland and cold). My coworkers both ordered food as well and were also unhappy with their food. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The pictures on here were kind of deceiving for me, which is disappointing! I was looking for a new place to get a veggie or bean and cheese burrito that was open somewhat late, it was between here or trying the new Senor Taco. Wish I would have tried the other place, because this didn't really meet my expectations. There are a few things I did like about SomeBurros. For example, it was very clean, and the interior looked much nicer than I had anticipated. I also liked that it was inexpensive and they gave us chips and salsa. The people working there were not all that friendly. They were not awful or anything, just not the friendliest. I ordered a Veggie Burro, was glad that it was inexpensive. Chips and salsa were ok, the salsa tasted a bit like tomato sauce to me which seemed strange, but it was not terrible. When my burro came out I was not too pleased. I mean, shouldn't expect much for a $5 burro, but I did expect better! The lettuce and tomato that was served with it was looking kind of gross. The burro was super bland. Like even the salsa did not help much. Just lacked flavor. Also I do not think it was big enough to be considered a 'burro'. I ate it all and was still kind of hungry afterwards. I did like that the avocado was fresh though, there was one positive. Overall, my experience was meh. Probably would not go back here to meet my Mexican fast food needs, but it was not the worst culinary experience."}
{"text":"Not all burritos are created equal, but Someburritos is just \"plain\" nasty.   I thought the idea behind the burrito was more than just meet in a tortilla, which makes this a literally PLAIN burrito. if i wanted a large taco, i would have ordered a large taco. the taste was bland at best, their hot sauce is more of a tomato sauce than anything else.    I probably should have read some reviews before ordering. Everything including salsa costs extra... I literally walked out without eating. Service was what you would expect from a burrito joint, nothing stellar."}
{"text":"I was impressed with SomeBurros.  Technically this would be a Casual Dining Establishment but with the speed, efficiency, and price of a Fast Food Restaurant.  Our food was tasty and filling. Plus they have misters for outside dining too."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant ever! I drive from Tucson to Gilbert just to have the green chili burritos! They are beyond amazing! I always make sure to get the hot sauce and chips To go do that I can enjoy them later.  Side note: the green corn tamale is delicious , just like my grandma makes it!  The service is excellent. They have never gotten my order wrong! All of their locations have the same type of service, which is excellent! Everyone in there are friendly and they always recommend new dishes!  I recommend this restaurant and in any of their locations, I've been to all of them! They have this restaurant, in Flagstaff, Scottsdale, Phoenix/Tempe , Chandler, and Two in Gilbert! Hoping that they expand to Tucson, until that happens, I would be more than happy to drive 90 miles to get some delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"One star because, the only thing I liked about the food was the chunky salsa. The place was clean, but it was also empty. I wanted to like this place, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've eaten. As soon as you walk in the door, you have to grab a menu, which I had to hunt for and the employees seemed to have no clue as to what's what. I asked for salsa and the boy behind the counter let me know salsa comes with the meal. It doesn't, it's hot sauce. Big difference. So, I had to ask again. This time I asked for chunky salsa, which you have to pay for. Not an issue, just know the difference. I mean, we live in Arizona, for crying out loud! I won't go back."}
{"text":"No more happy hour? Not worth it then!  Have to agree that the staff has been slowly declining in service. It's so easy to wait at the pick up window for more than 5 minutes before anyone someone notices you're there. It's also like extra salsa comes out of their paycheck because if you ask for extra expect an eye roll.   Last visit for now. I would recommend one of the many options nearby."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Food is fresh, not microwaved.  Price is good, service with a smile, it is a must try on Scottsdale rd and Frank Lloyd wright."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a burrito. It's not the most amazing burrito but it definitely is on my cravings list of places to eat. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is always good and quick. It is definitely better than the majority of fast food Mexican spots. I always go for the red sauce."}
{"text":"I stopped at Some Burros with my daughter for Taco Tuesday. The Beef & Chicken tacos are $2 on Taco Tuesday. I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic and good the tacos tasted. My daughter (10 years old) even noticed the flavor standing out over other tacos we've had in the Chandler/Gilbert area. Chips and taco sauce were included with our order. Including a water and small beverage our total for 4 tacos came to just under $11. I will definitely go back to have the tacos again and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab some quick Mexican food (AZ style) - it's a toss up for me between this and Carolina's, which definitely has the better tortillas but Some Burros is one notch up from being a complete greasy spoon.  No Mexican style fountain drinks here though :(  So what to order?  I'm a fan of the three way burro (green, red and beans) and usually pair it with a couple tacos.  Orders always come with chips - the salsa tastes like pizza sauce kicked up a notch and made spicy.  They serve it in a squeeze bottle - don't knock it though, it'll grow on you.  I've been here several times and food is always consistently good - this ain't the best Mexican you'll ever have, but it's great to satisfy a quick burrito or taco fix."}
{"text":"The food is always Good. my company caterer from this location and the employees Love the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I joke around that it would make my Mother jealous if she knew how much I liked it. My Dad says the same thing. Growing up on Mexican food I can honestly tell you that the food tastes just like Mom and Nana used to make. I would try different places from time to time and felt like I was a bit of a critic holding them to the \"food I grew up with standard\". Little did I know how excellent Someburros is.   Tamales take an incredible amount of time to make and the ones here are pretty tasty and I have no idea how they do it. The chicken tacos are wonderful and even the corn tortilla that it is in reminds me of ovens full of tacos that Mom would feed us with. The red sauce on the enchiladas is excellent and tastes just like Nana's.  When a simple lunch triggers childhood memories, it's good enough to rave about in a review. This is not a corporate joint, so do not expect that. It is a family owned establishment that makes some pretty authentic Mexican food.   It is discouraging to see people compare this restaurant to a Rubios or Baja Fresh. The food is fast but it definitely does not taste like fast food and I seriously doubt they have horchata at either of those places. While it is as close to the real deal as I have tasted, it is just as good, if not better, than some of the sit down Mexican restaurants that I have been to."}
{"text":"I love their veggie burro. Their salsa is amazing as is ttheir guacamole. Everything here is always fresh!!"}
{"text":"Awful tasteless food. Nothing had any flavor - just all had the same dull flavor / or non flavor"}
{"text":"Someburros' new Tempe spot is great! First and foremost, the service is awesome. We were welcomed with friendly faces, and didn't even have the chance to be overwhelmed by the extensive menu because our cashier walked us through it step by step. Lots of customizable options, and breakfast served all day!   Chips and salsa come free with your meal, which honestly makes a meal for me, so I was sold then. The actual food itself wasn't anything to write home about, but it did the job.   You'll find your way to Someburros if you're looking for a fast casual meal that will satisfy everyone in your party."}
{"text":"Always amazing from the staff to the food, I've been coming here with my family for years and I'm not planning to stop. If you want seriously good authentic Mexican food at a great price come here!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the first time today and the two stars is simply because the chicken burro was good and good sized. The tortilla was good too.   The customer service sucked. Gracie took my order and basically just stood there and looked at me instead of being friendly or helping me out. I ordered my food and then after some silence she mumbled at me that it doesn't come with anything in the burrito. Okay. That's fine. But she didn't go out of her way to tell me my options or anything of the sort. She mumbled my total at me, tossed the soda cup over onto my tray, and walked away.   I filled up my soda and stood there waiting for my food because it's an extremely nice day outside and inside was a little cold for my taste. I stood waiting for my burrito while the 4 or 5 girls working there stood there talking to eachother about clubbing. My burrito was ready and sitting on the food warmer (when I'm the only customer, I would think it would be easy to take care of the only order if there are 6 employees). One that was on her way out because she was off was kind enough to respond to my request to hand me my food. The other employees heard me tell her that I didn't see any point in waiting for my food while they stood there talking.   The birds outside are ballsy and will even fly onto your table while you're eating. Fairly alarming but also entertaining to watch.   Food: decent Customer service: beyond horrible  Birds: ruthless"}
{"text":"Run of the mill place.  More authentic than Chipotle and Chevy's.  It is similar to Filibertos.  The food is on the bland side and a little pricey for what you get.  I am still not use to the Arizona style of Mexican food where part of the ingredients of a burrito (burros) are served outside of it as a garnish on the plate!  It is nearly impossible to insert it in afterwards, espcially if you get a wet burrito."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The veggie burrito was amazing. I am only giving three stars because they charged me $1.62 for the smallest cup of guacamole I have ever seen in my life. $1.62!!!! And I came here to eat with the last of my money till payday. Other Mexican good places charge way less for way more guac. We paid for 3 full meals, it would have been nice to have a courtesy cup of guac. And the lady that took my order didn't seem to know how to smile. Other than that the food was good."}
{"text":"Just okay fast-food Mexican. It was our first time and we needed a minute to look at the menu & we had questions. We felt rushed to order by the dude at the register and he wasn't helpful at all. I had the taco & tamale meal. The beef on both tasted really overcooked. The best part were the chips-they were really good."}
{"text":"the food is generally pretty good for lower-priced cafe style Mexican food. I think the portions are generous and the price point is decent. I think the staff could be nicer but what do I expect from high school kids, right? super lame that you have to preordained by phone to use the drive thru.  also, the lines and wait times can be pretty extensive if you go at peak times."}
{"text":"OK i have try-ed this place 5 times now and every time it was bland, no taste. but i think that's the way it goes in AZ, people that grew up here have no taste they just eat where and whatever is there and like it lol Cervantes on mill/southern is fresher and taste better!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and quick service.  It's a little noisy and \"busy,\" and tables are crowded together.  But if you want good food, this will work.  We tried several things, and all were very good:  mini chimis, chicken tostada, chicken enchilada, guacamole, salsa.  Can't beat the food!"}
{"text":"I am Mexican, and went here on a Sunday thinking it was going to be great. To be honest the food was not good at all. The salsa had no flavor and they only have red salsa. No salsa options, and the food has no kind of seasoning at all. I think a salsa stand would be good here."}
{"text":"Excellent!  All locations are good.  Great kids meal and comes with a churro!  Cinnamon chips are really good as well."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Greatest kids menu with plenty for them to eat.  The salsa and beans were really great!"}
{"text":"Oh ACK someone elses totally incorrect assessment of the situation prompted me to write a second review as a retort.   This place is totally dis-similar from Filbertos.   PERIOD."}
{"text":"This place is just horrendous. The first time I moved here we went looking for a good Mexican place to eat and found this place.  Our food tasted like it was microwaved and not authentic at all.  This is a white man's version of Mexican food. I might as well buy canned Mexican meals or frozen ones, much cheaper that way. Don't come here if you want a days long of stomach aches and regrets."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale  on vacation and decided to stop here after shopping at Trader Joe's.   Mexican  as fast food.  Friendly staff and good food.."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Always a good place to eat with friends and/or family. Have not had anything that I did not like. The horchata is really really good. Great serves and happy workers."}
{"text":"lately I find myself in the area about once a week and had never tried any location of this Arizona chain.  I ordered a combination plate at the counter and found a place to sit.  Being the early part of lunch hour it was almost empty but progressively got busier while I was there.  Place was clean.  The food came out quickly and was tasty.  Both the order taker and the gentleman who brought out my food were pleasant.  I enjoyed my visit and will keep it in the rotation for when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Never do the online order! I love the food here, but they try to do the tech thing and doesn't work out for them. I hate wasting time. If they would at least be generous in their apology for wasting my time... I'd be thankful"}
{"text":"I promise you.  I.  promise.  you.  These are the best burritos (note: calling a 'burrito' a 'burro' is dumb and only prevalent in PHX) in town.  They are bigger than a baby's arm and have very moist chicken throughout.  The 'Crudo burro' with rice and beans plate is CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Their salsa comes in a squeeze bottle, which i love because of the regulatory physics behind squirting delicious red salsa onto a burrito bite-by-bite.  They also have churros, which is ALWAYS a plus for me because I'm crazy about them for dessert.  Prices are slightly steeper than your typical neighborhood Mexican joint and they DO have a drive-thru, which you must call ahead for, then pick up at the window."}
{"text":"Super fast friendly service.   Great hot sauce.  The bean burrito is REALLY good. It's almost like dessert.   The fish tacos are pretty good too.  What else do you need?"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Someburros and love that they have opened a location closer to home. I normally call the order in and drive thru and pick it up, easy breezy!  This trip I was picking up a #9, two shredded beef tacos with beans and rice. The tacos are what I crave, they are perfectly fried and the beef perfectly favored, topped with cheese and lettuce. Sometimes you just want a messy hard taco and Someburros fulfills that need!  Service was fast and friendly, I am sure once ASU is back in session, it might get a little busy, but I have found this location to be less busy than the baseline location.  The family and I love Someburros so I know we will back back!"}
{"text":"Its been over a year since I have had someburros and man I had forgotten how much I really like their red chile sauce, it's the perfect blend of spices and heat!  We had a retirement party at work and Someburros catered the event, there was green chile & red chile mini burros, taquitos and even black bean burros for our veggie lovin friends at work.   It was a great little spread, plenty of chips and hot sauce, sour cream & even guacamole.    Good job Someburros! It was perfect for the party!"}
{"text":"I ordered some lunch online and went to pick them up. Service was ok -- since I didn't eat in I cannot say much about it.  I order shredded chicken, shredded beef, and a taco-enchilada combo. They fried the taco which was really different. Their meat was okay, not too bad but their enchilada is probably the worst I've tasted. I probably won't come back though."}
{"text":"Omg... TexMex.  I've always heard that word and never really understood it but, this must be it.  We went here the other night, after driving by it for a long time, and wow, were we disappointed.  We ordered three different things and not one of them would I reorder.  The Pollo Fundido was the best of the three but not at all comparable to a Filiberto's Chicken Chimichanga. haha    I guess we like our Mexican food from solid taquerias and this is more of a 2nd date kinda joint. The decor makes non-adventurous food people feel safe and... adventurous. I'm struggling to give it 2-stars... but will do so because of the laid back atmosphere and Orange Fanta in a bottle.   Won't see ya there."}
{"text":"Had catering at the office from this restaurant, I called in to check if lard is used in the bean, but was very disappointed to know that they use lard in almost all their dishes, even the rice I was told it had lard. Many people today try to stay away from lard for either health or religious reasons ( Muslims, Jews, Hindus etc..) therefore I highly suggest that they make it clear on their menu what items have lard so people would know. Thank You"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I had one of their special burros with a spicy beef and it looked small but it was very filling. One downer is they didn't have any agua fresca. Not sure if this is always the case or they ran out. I would definitely like to go back and to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Cool atmosphere. Seems to be pretty popular. Small place. Great selection. Sauces are fantastic!  Might be some of the best food I have ever had!  Would go here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I really like their shredded beef tacos and machaca.  Although, I keep forgetting to tell them \"No papas en mi Machaca por favor!  Reasonably priced and each location I have visited (3 so far) has been doing great business!  I am a fan."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are great in that they're free but the taste really isn't great, so I rarely eat them...  But I do SO love the Pollo Fundido! Chicken is tender inside...ample jalapeno sour cream and a little bit of cheddar--YUM."}
{"text":"I love someburros they never fail to please. The pollo fundido is always awesome and the wife always gets the poncho villa and it never fails to please and satisfy."}
{"text":"Got a taco salad today for lunch and it was pretty good up until I had seen how much water was in the bottom. I attached a picture of how watered down my taco salad was. It ruined it for me. The only thing that was really good was the top of the taco shell.   I'm glad they wash the lettuce but I guess they don't bother with trying to get as much water out of it as possible before putting it in your food."}
{"text":"Bean and cheese burrito is amazing! I've also had the taco salad and it's huge! Someburros is my go to authentic Mexican restaurant! I call ahead of time because it could take 10 min to make fresh. I only have a half hour for lunch so I can't waste time."}
{"text":"This is the 1st and last time I would ever eat food from this place. I only took a bite before spitting the food out. It was so greasy it was disgusting that I actually gagged. I guess there is always a first time for trying something, I did, and now it's time to move on to something better! This place is definitely not it!!  If I could give it less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"In town for a few days and excited to eat at my childhood favorite spot. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. After ordering online and picking up according to the schedule they set, my food was cold, the meat was overcooked and I could barely swallow it. Additionally I got all the way home and realized there was no hot sauce in the bag. How am I supposed to eat tough taco meat without hot sauce? My boyfriend liked his salad though good thing it was supposed to be cold."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food is delicious, the prices are great, free chips and awesome salsa. My go to meal is the El Diablo Scramble. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff sure doesn't listen! I told the kid at the register my order 3 times and they still got it wrong! I ordered my burrito enchilada style and got a plain burrito no sauce. How many time do I have to order before it's right."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch recently.  The restaurant is one of those 'Tweener' places that's not quite fast food, not quite sit down.  You order at a counter and they bring the food out to you. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=DfsU-CsIddif5KvRj2aeQA  After browsing the menu, decided to go with the Carne Asada Burro (Steak, Beans, Rice and Pico de Avocado, $4.95).  It comes with complimentary Chips & Salsa and you can refill your Chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=NHAjUA3KMYUy-V8y5i1myA  They have a bottle of Hot Salsa on the table for you to use.  It's not too Spicy, but better than Mild Salsa. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=vDjj2E6e0LU0j7BHBI9PYQ  The Burro was just OK, nothing special.  The food was fresh but just lacked that extra special flavor to make it great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HshPHJ-OJ0rpVR-okV55Rg?select=nl6zwg9DykIVa0VqehHnYQ  Overall, it was a A-OK experience.  Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"Foods okay.. service is really crappy though.:) Especially from the younger teen employees. Always have an attitude and roll their eyes after customers walk away. Just rude. Their job can't be that hard but oh well.  Edit- 2 min into food and already 3 short brown hairs in my food :( gross"}
{"text":"Soo good. I love Some Burros.  Love their service and their Carne asada tacos are simple and tasty.  I went with three friends today and all of us loved our meals."}
{"text":"Good, solid, Mexican food at reasonable prices. What else can you ask for? Not fancy, but clean, efficient, and delicious."}
{"text":"If any restaurant were to rate a 0, it would be Someburros.  Between slow service and not being able to make a custom order, the white girls that run and manage this restaurant need to take a lesson from some Hispanic folk who run a home-owned operation.  On arriving at the Someburros location in Tempe, 4:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, I observed about 1/3 of the tables had someone sitting there...all eating or waiting.  There was one person at the counter schmoozing with one of the order chickies...not placing an order, just speaking to her in a quietly nasty nasal voice.  The other chickie was bouncing between the drive-thru and the phone, while first girl flirted obliviously...  I stood at the register for 2 minutes before chickie who was flirting realized I was ready to order.  She meandered over and asked what I wanted, for here or to go.  Being on the guacamole burrito quest, I let her know I wanted to order a custom burrito, specifically that contained guacamole, bacon, cheese, sour cream and raw onion. 4:04 PM I have a receipt for the order.  Chickie created a 'burro' that was a Bacon&Egg Burro (3.85) with no potatoes, no egg, add  guacamole (1.35), add Sour Cream (.96) and onion (.15) for a total after tax of $6.89.  Chickie asked me if I wanted salsa and marked my receipt.    I moved back to a position in proximity to the delivery station.  Orders older than mine moved out through the line.  Several large orders made their way out and folks received them to carry home.  4:16, I am called...I picked up my order and headed out to pick up the Valley Metro Limo.  Once at home, I opened up the burrito I received based on my order.  This was a 10\" tortilla with cheese, sour cream and raw onion.  The meat I received had no visual resemblance to bacon.  It is a most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.  Most glaringly absent: guacamole.  I picked up my receipt and called the restaruant.  Michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold.  I asked how long she expected it to be and only heard a click in reply.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and asked if I could hold.  I asked if I had to and she replied \"Yes\" before making the phone click again by putting me on hold.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and told me to \"Please hold\" and pushed the button before I could reply.    When Michelle picked up for the 4th time, I cut her off before she could say \"Please Hold\" again by asking if the manager was available.  She said she was, laid the phone down (without putting me on hold) and went to get the manager.   Next, white girl Sara picked up the phone and asked how she could help me.  I shared that I was in about 30 minutes prior and ordered a custom burrito.  She said she remembered, and called me by name.  I told her the burrito had no guacamole and she asked me if I could return to the restaurant so she could give me the guacamole.    I advised I was riding the bus and the next round would not be available for over an hour.  She told me to hold onto the receipt, write her name on it, and next time I was by, she would give me a portion of guacamole.  I asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady.  \"Is it reasonable, then, for me to have waited 6 minutes and been put on hold 3 times?\" Sara said that the girl running the phones may have been a bit overwhelmed and that it would not happen again.  I am certain it will not happen again as I highly doubt I will waste my time returning to a hispanic restaurant run by white girls."}
{"text":"Great location for taco takeout! We had taco day at work and our order was pretty big with no flaws! Tasted great as well! Thanks for making my job easier!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  I only get the tacos here because every time I try something else I'm extremely disappointed.  There isn't a lot of flavor in their food.  It's ok if you need Mexican and you're in the area, but you're better off going to the Senior Taco that's just down the road."}
{"text":"23 min wait for two chicken tacos with rice and bean, Uber eats orders were expedited fast and efficient during my wait, however there was only two tables when I walked in that already had there food I was the only one in line , place was dead decided to go there instead of Costa Vida so I could get a bit e to eat fast, a couple of girls ordered after myself but finished there whole meal before I got my order to go, brand ambassador not present. Weak for a new place trying to get traction in a competitive market"}
{"text":"Surprised to see a couple of negative reviews on this place.  Ok, so its not mindblowingly spectacular.  But, if you expected culinary brilliance from a place that is located in a glorified strip mall and serves salsa in a ketchup bottle, you should probably reevaluate your expectations.  I always enjoy a good ol' fashion Bean and Cheese Burrito or the Chicken Avocado Salad.  I love their spicy salsa and usually use the salsa instead of dressing on the salad.  We have used their catering service for a couple big family parties and everyone always enjoys it."}
{"text":"Their claim to fame seems to be the pollo fundido.  To that I say, I've had better.  While inexpensive, the fundido was a little salty and could have used more flavor, but all and all, not a waste of time. :). Salsa and chips are free for eat ins, and the salsa is yummy.  As for the best pollo fundido, I recommend Julio G's in Scottsdale and PV."}
{"text":"In a town FILLED with awesome Mexican food places... this place is sorely out of it's league! Nothing worse than paying more than you should for what amounts to nothing more than mediocre food. Places like this should always remember that there is never a Taco Bell never far away.   Was my lunch edible? Sure. Was if good? No. Was I upset I paid $8? Yes!  These guys need to take trip to Filiberto's and see what you get for five bucks. HUGE carne asada burritos... that's what!   Looking over everyone else reviews, I guess I am going against the grain on this one... but I call it like I see it.  This place was way better when a Krispy Kreme donut stood in its same location. You should walk the extra few feet and eat at In and Out Burger."}
{"text":"We just love this place the Pollo Fundido is the best!  The chips are always fresh and the kids love it too!  Their Salsa is ok it's the only complaint we have.  Always fast hot and great portions!"}
{"text":"While some people swear by this place I cannot.  The food is decent clean New Mexican fare that is very average.  The restaurant itself is clean and is considered sit down fast food.  The price point is just right with meals between $5-$10 and free chips and salsa (Chipotle should note this!)  3.5 out of 5 stars for fair priced clean quasi Mexican cuisine.   I will stick to Polliberto's for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love someburros and am happy to have one closer to my place! Every Tuesday it is my go to place and I like how the design inside differs from the other someburros. Great job!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but...They need to do something with the drive thru situation!  I have spoken to the manager before and no one seems to care.  If someone's food is not finished when they pull up to the drive thru window, ask them to go to the end and keep doing that if the food is not done.  Seriously!  We have been in the drive thru right now for 25 minutes waiting because someone probably just called in their food and then sat at the window while it was being cooked.  Have some professionalism!  A lot of my friends have already stopped coming for this reason.  Business will start to show the frustration of customers!!"}
{"text":"Since I work right around the corner from this Tempe restaurant, this is a go to place for weekday lunch. But you better get there early, because the small restaurant fills up fast. Good, fresh and tasty Mexican food. I usually get the chicken/avocado salad and then add a lot of the red chili sauce. You have your choice of dressing too, and I go with the jalapeno ranch.  They have a drive through for take out, but you have to call ahead."}
{"text":"Had the wrong order delivered tonight and no one even tryed to make it right  Food that was delivered was greasy cold not the right food  Would not recommend this place at all its bad customer service and bad food   Was charged for food we never got yet ordered"}
{"text":"I LOVE burritos.  I LOVE tacos.  I LOVE mexican food in general.  However, I do not LOVE this place.  Why? 1.  Greasy. 2.  Kind of tasteless 3.  Nothing really great on the menu 4.  The salsa is bland  People I used to work with absolutely loved this place....I don't see why."}
{"text":"I never knew green chilies were more valuable than gold. We ordered a dozen red tamales and a dozen green chilies. The person taking our order was not happy that we did not give them a 24 hour notice that their \"gourmet tamales\" require for such a large order. The red tamales were as dry as sawdust and the green chilies came with one small sliver of chili. The \"hot Sauce\" they have is nothing more than enchilada sauce with red chili flake added. Next time I'll just go to Del Taco where two dozen .40 cent tacos do not require a 24 hr notice from a family of 6."}
{"text":"LOVE me some Someburros!! Where else can you get an AMAZING, fresh, tasty, filling breakfast burro (burrito) at all hours of the day? Someburros I say!  I am always greeted by a friendly face and smile when I arrive at Someburros and they are always super helpful when it comes to making menu selections. Did I mention the breakfast burros yet?? SO GOOD.  Also, they have some of the best green chile tamales I have had anywhere (and they sell them by the dozen!!), the cheese enchiladas are the perfect blend of red chile sauce and yummy cheesy corn tortilla goodness. The beans and rice are fantastic...and the breakfast burros...GET ONE! For real!  Love this place, the drive thru is convenient for phone or online orders and makes getting in and out with your Someburro loot even easier."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place with a wide variety of food.  We had the nachos and I was pretty disappointed with them.  It's just beans with sprinkled cheese on tortilla rounds. The enchiladas however,  were super awesome and delicious.  On point.  Other than that I'd say just nibble on the free chps and salsa because the salsa tastes ketchup based,  but it is hot!  Also,  I enjoy the pricing because you get what you pay for in quantity and it's pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"Decent stop for a quick lunch.  The food is pretty much just your ordinary run of the mill quick-stop Mexican food.   Not meaning that it is bad food, because it's good.  But it's nothing special.  I really like the chips.  I dip them in the beans because as some other reviewers stated, the salsa is boring.    But if you're looking for a decent quick Mexican lunch, stop on in this place."}
{"text":"great prices, some of my favorite beans in town and i'm a bean snob!!"}
{"text":"As a midwestern transplant I have come to appreciate the greatness of having a good taco shop in the neighborhood. I live close to Someburros so it is my go-to place when I need a taco quick.  I've been going to Someburros for quite a while and never had anything that I didn't like. Their tacos are solid, tostadas are good, rice and beans are good - really everything on the menu is worth eating.  But this past weekend I tried a menu item I had not tried before - the beef and potato taco. It's midwest meets southwest and my Minnesota tastebuds were jumping for joy with the first bite. I know it sounds weird to have potatoes in a taco but seriously this thing is awesome. Ground beef with a little bit of taco seasoning, bits of potato, cheese and lettuce stuffed into a hard shell taco - yum!!  This discovery may be dangerous considering the proximity to my house."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Scottsdale Some Burros tonight, I asked the girl if the verde scramble was vegetarian. She said yes, except that it came with refried beans, and they had lard in them. She said I could substitute whole beans for the refried at no extra charge. Great, except that when I got home, I saw that I was charged an additional $1.75 for the whole beans. To make it even worse, I didn't get whole beans, I had the refried beans.   They've  just lost a customer. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I get to eat at their Chandler location whenever I'm in town visiting friends. It's a nice change of pace from the Mexican food you find in California. The open face cheesecrisp is a great one to share and the taquitos and guacamole are my favorite. The atmosphere is nice and it's always clean. This is a great place if you're looking for a quick and delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Had to come in because I like pollo fundido burritos and since this one had been winning awards and named in best of articles I figured I'd check it out.  Wasn't bad, chicken was moist and I liked both their red and green salsas. But, it wasn't the best one I've ever tried.  I don't even think it's the best in the north part of the valley.  Los Olivos and Valle Luna both have better fundido burritos in my opinion.  I also ordered a carne asada taco.  It tasted good,  but seems overpriced for basically just a street taco.  Restaurant was clean and nice, service was fast.  I'd come again, but I wouldn't plan on any \"award winning\" fundido."}
{"text":"It had been years since I'd been to this location, and I will not be going back! Called in the order to be a quick pick up, ended up waiting at the window for 15 minutes for the staff trying to figure out how to split the check on two debit cards! Was treated very rudely by staff member Michelle & \"manager\" Sara, and upon getting home, the food was made incorrectly! Veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese. Thanks for the memories Someburros but your rude staff and inability to get the food right means it will be another 10 years before I give you my business!"}
{"text":"Only ate here once.  The service was nothing to write home about.  The food is very lackluster--tastes like they buy all of their ingredients in the \"Mexican\" section at Restaurant Depot and throw them together to fool the gringos (whom, I might add, appear to be the ones here on Yelp who gush the most about the food).  Not \"authentically Mexican\" and not all that delicious.  Not the worst I've ever had . . . but don't go there believing the hype--you might be just as disappointed as we were."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been to Someburro's a thousand times, and I like it...I really do... However...the problem that 990 out of those thousand times I've had the Pollo Fundido, simply one of the best fast guilty pleasures that you can experience.  However, after eating it, I feel like I've just dug another inch closer to the grave...or shaved another couple of days off of my life.  As I age...I'm trying to eat healthier, so here I am at Someburro's trying to find something healthy that doesn't give me visions of the grim reaper, and that gives me the near orgasmic feeling that I have when down the Pollo Fundido.    So far, I haven't found anything else on the menu that fits the bill.  I've tried the veggie burro which is probably the healthiest thing on the menu, and it's....eh....ok.  The avocado in it is great, and I haven't seen them put less than fresh avocado slices in it.  I once tried the taco salad, which was WAY less than satisfying, and actually kind of gross.  I mean, you take some actually healthy stuff and surround it in a bowl of fried whatever...  I'm also not big into shredded beef or the machaca.  The chicken quality is ok, but has a good portion of dark meat in it.  It's good because it's marinated so heavily, though I'd imagine that the marinade does not add to the health quotient.  On the bright side, this place is decent for kids.  There are inexpensive options for little ones. We get the quesadilla's for the boys, who pretty much just pick over the quesadilla waiting for the go-ahead from mom to dive into the Churros.  By the way, the Churros are no bueno, in my opinion.  The kids like 'em cause they are doused in sugar, but they aren't doughy...they are crunchy crispy and fried...fried...fried.  I feel pangs of guilt as if I'm poisoning my children when they eat those.  Some of you reading this are probably thinking...if he's trying to be healthy, perhaps he shouldn't be going to Someburro's in the first place....and you're probably right."}
{"text":"The chimis are the best I've ever had. I am never disappointed whenever I eat here. The portions are fair priced and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"It is as American as a an Americanized Mexican joint gets, without screwing up the food.  This place has such a simple concept, great organization, and consistency in their products and service.  Although, it's not an authentic Mexican joint, they do a great job at preparing kids and Americans who are uncultured to cross over to the true Mexican side.  The names of the dishes, as well as the presentation of many are all good, but they have tamed down their versions of these dishes to cater to a different crowd.  I recommend this place when you are on a quick lunch break from work.  The Chicken in the Pollo Fundido, is more flavorful, tender, and juicy than any of their competitors, such as Serrano's Garcia's, etc. They roll the marinated chicken breast into a burrito, deep fry it, then top it with Crema, and Cheddar Cheese. It is served with a side of shredded lettuce and rice. The consistency of this and other dishes has been there over the years.  They make their red chile salsa in house and keep it mild for the target audience. You get free chips and salsa with your purchase.  It is basically a Mexican fast food joint that makes things fresh and in house, but with a slight American twist.  They run a great, simple concept of a business. If you enjoy Mexican food that has been tamed down for the Weditos, then this is your place.  Salute! =)"}
{"text":"Nice service but very mediocre food at best.  Generous portions for reasonable price but no real flavor.  Salty but no spice or anything memorable."}
{"text":"I like the idea of a walk-up Mexican food restaurant that otherwise operates as a restaurant, so they get high marks for conceptual design and good service.  However, the rest is up to taste and, after three visits to Someburros, everything has tasted mediocre. It's a bit surprising, because I didn't think Mexican food could ever be bland. They need to add spices to give it some kick. Sadly, I won't be around to ever find out because I'm taking my appetite for good Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a bean and cheese chili, which was yummy. But when I walked in at about 3:50 pm, I was the only customer and all four booths and two tables  were unbussed. Manager was behind counter chatting with employees. At 4:00 an additional person must have come on, because that guy started bussing tables. He also brought me my order. I had to pick through the silverware because some of the pieces were dirty. Manager needs to step up his game and do some work if they're short handed.   My chimi was good, soda was calibrated correctly, and the guacamole was excellent. Their beans are always good, and the cheese enchiladas are excellent. Would have been five stars but for the cleanliness issue."}
{"text":"Holy Frijoles! This place is TASTY! We were exploring the area (aka playing Pokemon Go) and stumbled across this little restaurant in the back (which is also a Pokemon gym f.y.i). We ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga with green sauce and two shredded beef tacos. The service was courteous, they never mentioned that they were closing in 20 minutes, they just were sweet and smiling.   We got our order within 5 minutes and not only was the presentation appetizing but the smell was intoxicating. We stuffed our Pokemon trainer faces and from the first bite to the last, it was magical. I was just so sad that we don't have one closer to home. :-(   Prices are just right. I paid 6ish bucks for my chimi and 5ish for tacos. When they were closing, they never made us feel like we should leave. The server even came up to us and told us \"Can I get you guys anything else? Take your time and don't rush.\"  I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"One of the things I was most excited about when I moved to Arizona, besides Jack in the Box (judge me if you want, I LOVE their tacos) was Someburros.    I had my first Someburros meal back in 2009 when I came to Arizona as a tourist.  I fell in love with their menu... so cheap yet soooo good.  Thus, when I moved here, I decided to high tail it to my local restaurant.  It was good, but not as good as I remember.  Maybe it was the dish I got, though.  I got the veggie burrito and it seemed... dry.  The tortilla was dry and the burrito wasn't full enough, so it was mostly just dry tortilla.  I may try a meat filled burrito next time, just to see if it was the type of burrito I ordered.  The chips and salsa are excellent tho!  So is the side dishes you get with a combo meal: Spanish rice and refried beans.  Their refried beans are very good, the best you'll get from a \"fast food\" restaurant.  That's another thing... I put fast food in quotes because the only thing that makes it fast  food is the speed with which you get the food.  And the fact that the food comes on disposable plates and with plastic cutlery.    Wonderful place, glad I went... but the next time I go, if I get a generously filled burrito in a tortilla that didn't seem microwaved, I'll review Someburros again and give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this 0 stars. Terrible food and terribly over priced. Charged me 85 cents for cheese in a bean and cheese chimichanga... small portions and everything was cold. Absolute garbage."}
{"text":"Poor service. Took 15 min to get a take out order. Will never go back. They didn't even care about their customers."}
{"text":"I just moved here a few months ago from chicago and have been craving a big awesome burrito like the ones back home.. filled with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, meat, maybe some guac all rolled up in a tender tortilla...mmmm....big glass of horchata...  ...I was not expecting this taco bell sized burrito stuffed with nothing except for the meat I ordered. A little lettuce and whiteish red tomato on the side was all I had to pretend it was veggie stuffed. :-( and to think I passed up the delicious shrimp tacos at rubios for this? AND paid over $7 for this :'( no bueno."}
{"text":"I have been to Someburros a few times now... and I have to say I am not too impressed with this place on this trip I ordered the Crudo Burro - (Tender machaca beef combined with a spicy, light green tomatillo sauce with beans. The beans had no flavor really I covered them with salsa the burro had way to much extra tortilla but the meat in side was really good could have gave me a pile of that on my plate would have been a better meal... So I am not sure if I will go out of my way to revisit this spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! Even if the staff is rude and ugly. The food is bomb. If they stopped hiring greasy teenage girls with zits this place would be a 5 star all day."}
{"text":"I love Someburros! Not quite as good as Cafe Rio but it holds its own. The bean and chicken burrito is simple but delicious! We always make a stop when we're in town."}
{"text":"Ok, but not as good as San Tan Marketplace one. I had the \"poncho villa\" and it's basically a red chili burro. Was a little to bitter for me, but wife loved it.  Next time I'll stick with tacos & enchiladas."}
{"text":"I enjoy some burros because it's a good cross between fast food and sit down Mexican food.  The taste is always fresh, and good - the service is fast and friendly, even with a packed house.  It satisfies my Mexican fix and does not leave me regretting life afterwords .... (like Filbertos does)  I have only had this location, but have gone back numerous times and will continue to hit this place up and work my way through the menu ... I had the beef taco and been enchilada today ... see pictures ... you will want."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation to try a red burro. I ordered the red burro and I ordered a machaca as well. The red burro was very good and fresh! The machaca was one is the best I have had. They serve breakfast all day here and the food is not too pricey. I was impressed with the food here and will try carne asada tacos the next time. The location was very busy and they have a drive thru as well. Parking is limited here.  I like this place and will be back again. I highly recommend this place and to try a red burro! You definitely will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go to place to grab lunch, I work across the parking lot and it's a quick and great place to grab a bite.  Everyone there is very happy and helpful at all times.  I've never had a bad experience here ! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Good Mexican, above the fast food type, I had a carne asada burrito, with sauce? It was really good, hubby had the albondigas soup, delish! We were happy with our food and will be back!"}
{"text":"cheesy, but great greasy mexican food. this place has my favorite hot salsa in the valley. love their veggie burritios and chips! super affordable."}
{"text":"Here is now this started....I was in college and took a road trip to AZ. One of my buddies recommended SomeBurros and said it would blow my mind. Being from So Cal I brushed it off because no one knew about Mexican food like an Angelino. Found a Some Burros and had the highly recommended Pollo Fundito. That is how I first got addicted. Ever since then, every chance that I get to come to Phoenix, I immediately take just so that I can plunder which ever Some Burros location I happen to be near.   So here is my review of the Scottsdale location:  Friendly Staff Great Margaritas My kids devoured two portions of beans each!! So Amazing refried beans.  As always, the Pollo Fundito did not disappoint!!  To the ownership, thank you for this amazing restaurant! Keep up the good work!   Sincerely,  A life long fan!"}
{"text":"Visited this past weekend. My group ordered the crispy chicken tacos, carne asada, and crispy potato tacos. The food passed the test!   It is great to finally have a second decent option for good Mexican food in this part of town!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family. Was not impressed so much. Place was not that busy but still took forever. Even saw our waitress talking with some guy at the counter while we had to wait. Food was ok but had better as far as Mexican goes. Won;t be back any time soon. Sorry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places ever. The restaurant is always clean and the staff are always friendly. The food is great quality and prices are reasonable as well. I highly recommend the mini chimis!"}
{"text":"This location is by far the worst. They've botched our order every single time we've ordered from here. After the first time, you'd think we'd go somewhere else. We were actually trying to give them a chance. Stale chips Everytime. We're vegan, so we ordered the veggie burrito. Got home, cut it open to find chunks of meat throughout. Now to animal eaters, this would be ok....to me it's absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I have been going to Someburros since they first opened in 1986. I have tried almost everything on their menu and love it all!  Best red chili beef I have ever had!  Amazing chimichangas. I could go on and on about how delicious the food is.  Fantastic!!'"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Someburros! The salsa is way better than the others around the valley. Also, I found the burritos like the bean and cheese and vegetarian to be much fresher and made with better quality. The restaurant is clean and really cute. Definitely a quick, delicious bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Over priced cheap ass Mexican food that makes Taco Bell look like a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the food from Someburros, but every single time I order online or over the phone, something is missing or wrong with my order. These people are in such a hurry that they don't take the time to review the order upon taking it or placing it in the bag. So frustrated."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday with the boyfriend. He grew up going here and loves it.   Its a cute little restaurant and PACKED. The staff is very nice and everything is quick and clean. I forget the name of what I got but it was chicken with cream cheese melted over top. It was huge and delicious and we also got a cheese crisp with guac, which you cant really go wrong with that.  I also had a horchada which was yummy and the perfect dessert.   I'd definitely go here again since they have the more mild Mexican for me and it makes the boyfriend happy. Make sure to text the little thing they have on the flyer since you get a little freeby perk!"}
{"text":"Omg ---so cold in this restaurant--actually shivering---I asked to turn it down a little, employee said \"it feels nice in here\"----no clean forks!!! What? Have to use plastic---uuuugggghhh!!!! Remember---customer FIRST---if they say it's cold---then it's cold---seriously like 60 degrees---food came out and got cold in two minutes--"}
{"text":"We went there for a family after church dinner at 11:00am. They were fairly busy which was a good sign. My family ordered the polo fundido, mini chili plate, crudo burro, and green tamales. The food was good and well worth the price and wait time( 10-15 minutes). They gave a generous amount of chips and salsa while we waited for our food.  The food arrived hot and pleasantly prepared. It didn't look like they cooked it on the plate or put it in the oven like most Mexican food restaurants.  I would like to have seen a little more spice in the food and the jalapeño cream cheese on the fundidos lacked excitement. Other than that, excellent food and service. Most definitely return."}
{"text":"**Sewer Alert** Walked into SomeBurros on FLW, sewer watter running out of restroom into dining area. Not very appetizing. Get a plumber."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Mexican lunch spots. Good food at a nice price. The Machaca beef burrito keeps me coming back for more. Warning they're kinda busy at lunch on Saturday , but the staff is well trained and handle things like the pro's they are. Plus you get a free meal on your birthday"}
{"text":"I seriously have no idea why people eat here where there are 100 better alternatives for Mexican food in this town. We had a shredded chicken chimichanga, green corn tamale, and chicken enchilada. All 3 were bland and tasteless at best and all three were very greasy. If you think Taco Bell is great Mexican then this is your place, otherwise, steer clear, go home and pop open a can of processed tamales from Del Monte, you'll get a better meal."}
{"text":"Meh. It was really nothing special. I should know better than to stray from America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"This is an ok Place if you want a fast meal. Food is decent. I had the Pancho Villa. A little on the bland side. Chips are good. They could use a little Mexican flavor to the whole spot. Kinda meh. I got more of a Taco Bell vibe with an attempt at a Filibertos twist."}
{"text":"This place always is on point!  I was very happy to see one in north Scottsdale when I moved over there."}
{"text":"Best fast mexican food in the area I have found so far. Those who find the 'Bell bland, and the 'bertos boring, this is it! (until of course something better comes along!) If you like it spicy though, shell out the extra for the green tomatillo salsa ..as the red doesn't have much heat or flavor."}
{"text":"Consistently one of the Best Mexican food restaurants in Arizona!!! Tacos are great!! Pollo Fundido is top notch!!! Love the Hot Sauce!!!"}
{"text":"As with other Someburros locations, they serve up excellent food at an inexpensive price.  The chorizo burro had a good proportion of meat to egg and potato, and was very flavorful, especially paired with the salsa they serve.  The salsa here seems to be tastier and more flavorful than at other locations.  The horchata here was refreshing, and not too sweet.  The service people at the counter were very friendly.  I'm glad there's a good place to get Mexican food in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's really been 7 years since I first reviewed Someburros! I'm still a big fan of the rod burro, but it's such a big meal that I usually only get it if I'm starving or sharing it with someone. Some of my current favorites are the cheese crisps with guacamole or with green chile, the veggie burro, the chicken and bean burro, and the tacos are still quite good. The salsa is still nicely hot and spicy, and the addition of carne asada, fish, and breakfast adds to their menu variety. While I appreciate that they're branching out with new foods, the fish tacos that I tried when they first introduced them to the menu were really not very appealing. They were overcooked, bland, and super oily. Hopefully they've perfected their recipe since then!  The outdoors seating is nice when the weather is not too hot, and they don't mind if you bring your dog with you to sit outside.   Sure it's not gourmet dining. But when you're hungry, craving a fast, filling meal for a reasonable price, Someburros is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Same quality food as other Someburros locations, but the chimichanga we ordered today seemed smaller than usual.  In fact, it was the same size as my veggie burro, which is usually noticeably smaller than the chimichangas.  Have they downsized?  We will need more testing to be sure. : )"}
{"text":"Stopped in after shopping at Trader Joe's for a quick snack and had an outstanding experience! My daughter and I shared 2 shredded beef tacos, rice, and beans. The manager asked the kitchen to split it for us and we couldn't have been happier. The taco was delicious and we both got a very generous portion of rice and beans. The lettuce and tomato were fresh as was the homemade salsa. We can't wait to go back! Gracias, Someburro!"}
{"text":"This is a low cost Mexican food cafeteria. You order at the counter and they deliver it to your table. No table service, and the food is not special. But it is decent and worth eating. The staff unfastened, though not overly customer service oriented.  I love this place for the low prices and quick service, but don't go for the cuisine excellence. The best application of this is place is for families or large groups. It's not cozy , it's cafeteria. But for what it is - I love it."}
{"text":"$11 to feel like you're gonna die... No thanks. The \"barracho burro\" looks like canned meat. Both my coworker and I have taken turns in the restroom all afternoon. I'll stick to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Love this place even if it is kinda gringo mexican. The red sauce is really good and I think they make because they give squirt bottle with each order . I could take a bath in this stuff! Had a wet beef chimichanga with the red enchilada sauce also very good. Taco Tuesdays are busy but worth it. Try through ground beef taco. Fast friendly service brought to your table."}
{"text":"Decent Carne asada burrito. The beans and rice were delicious!  Most importantly, the restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  This place is right around the corner from my office which I think will be dangerous for my waistline! I'm excited to try the breakfast burritos and other items."}
{"text":"This is another place on my regular lunch rotation.  I have been eating at Someburros for years frequenting the locations in Gilbert and by Chandler Mall as well as this location in Tempe.  This is deli style.  You go to the counter and order, they give you a number, and then bring the food to your table.  The restaurant is always clean and well staffed.  This location, though, is a little smaller than the Gilbert or Chandler Mall restaurants.  The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley, but it is fast and inexpensive.   Most adult meals with drink will cost about $8.  Kids cost 1/2 that.    I usually get one of the burritos.  Lately the Crudo Burro is my favorite.  It is shredded beef with SPICY tomatillo sauce.  Do not order this unless you can handle spicy food.  I also like the Rod Burro and the Poncho Villa.  I really like the rice, as well.    Someburros also has large party platters.  A number of times we have purchased party platters for a gathering at our house.  Our guests always devour the food and rave about it.  It is a relatively inexpensive way to cater a party.  Someburros is a great place for lunch and a relatively inexpensive way to feed the family.  If you have not tried it, definitely check it out."}

{"text":"If only I could give less, first they gave me the wrong order. Then came by actual order of chicken chimichanga possibly the worst thing I have eaten, the meat smelt funny ,the sause was bad, lost my appetite for the night, left all of it and left. I hate to waste food, and money too on the top."}
{"text":"This place is like an fancier type taco bell. You go to the counter to order and pay for your food then they bring it out to your table. You do get chips and salsa. My enchilada was pretty good. Portions were smaller then your typical mexican restaurant. My boyfriend order nachos which was a big joke and he said his tacos were extremely greasy."}
{"text":"This place was very delicious. Went here for the first time today and am only wishing there was one close to me in glendale! Food tasted fresh and the best part about my experience was the service. Everyone was so nice and helpful, patience and the location was very clean. Will be back."}
{"text":"It's a strange experience and seems like you get a great meal for a low $; but not all is what it seems.  The food is plated like a sit down restaurant; so I was surprised that the prices are Chipotle level.  I quickly realized that this was due to them skimping on protein.  So yes you get a $9 burrito, but it has very little steak, etc. Service was excellent and staff seemed to be really enjoying helping customers.   Food: My burrito was mostly tortilla and beans.  Next time I will ask them to leave the beans out and see what comes out. I would also prefer an option on the salsa; as the one given was a bit spicy for my taste.  Overall: Worth a visit and I will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"If it's been longer than a week I literally crave a burrito from Someburros.  I usually get the veggie burrito on a wheat tortilla with no cheese (pinto beans, pico de gallo, avocado) but will sometimes splurge on the bean and cheese burrito.  Their hot sauce is super hot and has a great flavor; it tastes great with the burritos and their chips.  My husband loves their breakfast burritos.    Someburros is definitely a set above fast food.  I appreciate that their prices are reasonable and that they have a call ahead pick up window."}
{"text":"My experience here makes me wish there was one of these in Tucson.  We made plans to visit Scottsdale and needed a place for lunch.  Thanks to some positive Yelp! reviews, we decided to give this restaurant a try, and our experience was outstanding.  Burger shop ambiance, but great food.  I had the Crudo Burro, made with machaca beef with a green tomatillo sauce.  Tangy and full of flavor that I have not found anywhere else. Almost makes me want to drive up to Scottsdale for lunch ..."}
{"text":"It's good, but it's not quite great. The two times that I have been have filling and the service is fast but idk, I feel like it's lacking something. I suggest asking for the salsa verde for your chips, that has been the best part of both my meals here."}
{"text":"There are lots of Mexican restaurants in the area but Someburros rises as one of the best in Tempe. Food is good, staff is pleasant and the restaurant is a nice environment.   Highly recommend: Pollo Fundido with a Margarita, outstanding Sonoran style Mexican food for a good price."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Tempe location for quite some time now and just recently made my way to the north location.   When I first walked in I was impressed with the amount of seating, but then the smell hit me. What is up with the overwhelming sewer smell? No one wants to eat in a place that smells like a sewer.. So we ordered and took refuge on the outside patio. The breakfast burritos were ok, not amazing but better than bertos. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow and when people don't clean up after themselves the place gets pretty messy.   I would recommend the veggie burro, great fresh pico and big chunks of avocado. I would however order it to go."}
{"text":"The Mill and Baseline location is excellent. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable and portions generous.  Their veggie burro is excellent with big fresh chunks of avacodo, mm hmm. Their chips and salsa are also better than most casual taco shops. You can order ahead and pick up at the take out windows."}
{"text":"I never like when a place is slow during dinner time. At 6:45, the place should have had more people. Clue #1. The people working were incredibly friendly. They were all young, so I was impressed. BUT....the food was not impressive. I had the taco salad and the chicken was dry and tasteless. My husband had a machaca burrito and there was so much tortilla, and hardly any filling. Very disappointing. We came here for a school's fundraiser so I'm not too upset, but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the service and food here! Not as ethnic or authentic as Polibertos but one can never go wrong with their burritos or horchatas! A great place to frequent for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Went on Cinco De Mayo and had incredible food. I have had their take out before but never sat inside.  The place was packed but the staff was cleaning up tables as quickly as they could.  The cashiers were friendly and provided assistance with menu suggestions.  My son had the kids meal and ate ALL of it.  I had a Pollo Fundido which was incredible.  The rice was cooked to perfection.  The only complaint I have is the Margarita size was not worth the price."}
{"text":"When eating at SomeBurros, I must remember that it is a family oriented, step above fast food, quick/fresh mex place, that does a good job of appealing to all palettes. That means.. from 5 year old kids, to granny.. which equates to.. BLAND. They have a wide array of fairly unique and original dishes, but because it tends to be insufferably bland, SomeBurros only gets 3 stars, instead of 4.  Pre-Diet, I used gorge on their Pollo Fundido.. which is a delightful blend extremely lean, white meat (canned?) chicken, fried in a flour tortilla, and glopped with a tasty cream cheese type sauce. Yum. days of eating fried crispy things, are past, however, and this time, I opted for the Verde Scramble (I luv some MexiBreakfast) and tried one of their new Carne Asada Tacos on the side.  The Verde Scramble was assembled well, but was painfully bland. The Carne Asada Taco was nothing special.. and a bit over priced at $2.50.   My sum up of SomeBurros - Quick, decently priced non-offensive Mexican food.  Something for just about everyone, and since it's not spicy, it's not gonna rip your gut up. :)  ALSO - Staff is universally friendly, and I love eating on the patio."}
{"text":"The menu is loaded with all your usual dishes, tacos, burritos (burros), enchaladas, tostados. After you order and pay, they give you a small paper boat of old, cold, stale chips and a squeeze bottle of red salsa, which I'm guessing is to be used on the cold, dry chips to bring them back to life. I ordered the Carne Asada Burro. It was cold, stiff, dry and lacked any flavor. It had a little bit of bland tasting guacamole, which looked like it was purchased from an outside vendor, and was probably squeezed from a 5 gallon bag. My GF had two street tacos. Same story as above. It looked like the crowd that was dining there was mostly senior citizens.  Not sure why that was or what the relevance is. Just seemed odd.   Bottom line: Cold food. Tasteless food. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love Someburros and was excited to see a new location close to work.  My first visit was great.  The service was good and food was awesome as ever.  I was getting my birthday lunch that day and when I returned to my office with my food I found a Happy Birthday note in the bag.  Very special.  While waiting I watched the manager wait on a deaf couple.  He handled them with grace and dignity.  He pointed to items while also speaking to them as though they were not hearing impaired.  It was wonderful.  Definitely eat here.  Everything on the menu is great!!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised with this place. I expected an Oregonian \"Baja Fresh\" experience but it was more than that.   I had a beef tostado, and LOVED the shell. So fresh and not just a hard corn tortilla. It was fresh and flaky. The beef was also marinated well and was fresh too. The prices were reasonable (tostado was under 6 bucks) and food arrives fast and hot. A solid choice for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my wife as we had never been to a Some Burros before. Staff here are very efficient and friendly. Food came out to us promptly and it was right on target flavor and spice wise. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent- albeit a bland for my taste when it comes to Mexican cuisine. It's a good place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood and are hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way. I've lived in Tempe since 2000, and I've been to this location several times over the years. I was there last weekend, and my food was alright; but as I stood waiting to place my order, I watched through the window into the kitchen as one of the cooks picked up food off the grill and snacked on it as she cooked. For some reason this really grossed me out... the hand to mouth while she was in a cooking environment was just seemed inappropriate. My husband and I were meeting friends there, so I sucked it up and ordered to avoid being a drama queen... but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their beef taquitos are my fav and my husband loves their breakfast burrito (eggs, bacon, cheese, potatoes). I would highly recommend this place. The pick up window is also a nice option if you don't feel like waiting."}
{"text":"My son loves Someburros and asks for it at every opportunity.  Probably payback for trying to steer him away from his beloved Taco Bell.  Someburros' food is pretty good, and about the same quality as you'd get at nearby institutions Carlos O'Brien's and Los Olivos.  For no waiter service, though, I'm surprised Someburros' prices are about the same as the others, too.  Someburros is good if you just want a quick bite, but if you have just 10 minutes more, Carlos' is only 2 blocks away and will give you huge portions of the same quality food for about the same price."}
{"text":"I got the Mexican Pizza because Abby D. said it was good, it tasted like freezer burn. I would give 1 star buuuuuut they give away free samples of their party burros and taquitos, and those were good!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat is Some Burros....we love the food and never had a bad meal there Great food and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and quality of food is consistent. My favorite menu items are the veggie burro and albondigas soup. Both never disappoint and fill me up."}
{"text":"This is the standard in Mexican food. It's take out and it's not too fancy, but it certainly gets the job done. My parents went to ASU and lived within a stone's throw Someburros and I have 'grown up' on its food."}
{"text":"Familia.. it's all there.  I've been enjoying this place since I landed in az back in the day.  This was always worth a few miles walk. This is the middle range between filberto's and a fancy Mexican restaurant.  I come here, and can only think of family, and of a friend place to have tacos, and salsa.  ditch the taco bell, del taco, chipotle chains and hit this Arizona classic."}
{"text":"What's up with not handing out utensils with drive thru orders? Cutting costs? Pretty inconsistent. Those working the drive thru window couldn't care less if they get your order right. One morning I had to wait 10 minutes while the chick was too busy refilling hot sauce, meanwhile my food is sitting in the pass. Pay attention?"}
{"text":"We always enjoy our visit to Someburros... friendly service and good food for a fast food type of restaurant.   They often offer really good specials throughout the week.  Our family of 4 all agree Someburros is a good choice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by after hearing a lot of hype. We were let down. Very bland taste. Honestly, I would rather run through a Filibertos."}
{"text":"Had the Mexican Pizza and it was absolutely disgusting. The meat was beef, I think. This is normally a great place to eat but I can't recommend the Mexican Pizza."}
{"text":"If you like plastic plates and forks, stryrofoam cups and ordering at a counter, you may like SomeBurros.  Basic Mexican food you can find on any corner.   Don't go expecting more."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to Someburros.  I've heard lots of people talk about it, but until recently had never eaten any of their food.  We recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from Someburros.  We were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves.  We went on Sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go.  The chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home.  The hot sauce IS tasty.    The service is horrible at this place!  The server was annoyed by our questions, was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working.  We felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service.    Despite the close proximity to our home, we won't be going back to this restaurant.   Rather, we'll be going to Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix!"}
{"text":"I waited and waited for this place to open hoping for a good fast food Mexican restaurant.  Boy, was I disappointed.  I ordered the mini chimis with guacamole and rice.  The chimis had meat in them that resembled dog food.  The guacamole was tasteless.  I also got an order of chips and then thought I would try both of their salsas.  The hot sauce (which is what they call their salsa) had a little heat to it, but I would not say that it was HOT.  The chunky salsa, which they described to me as tomatoes with vegetables???, and I said you mean like pico de gallo? and they said yes - it was basically tomatoes in a lot of juice with some onion, jalapinos and cilantro floating in it.  It had more of a taste of green peppers.  Others in my family ordered a beef burrito (that is all it had in it - just beef), a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada and nachos.  The enchiladas were not the best and the nachos were small tostada shells covered in beans and cheese with some tomatoes on them and then apparently put under a broiler to burn the edged.   Although I know that this location was completely remodeled, when I walked in, it reminded me of a place from the 80's.  The decor was cheap and old fashioned.  We will not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good burritos.  Bad salsa.  How can you mess up salsa?  Chips is a course unto itself and you don't have any good salsa?  Shame.  For shame!"}
{"text":"I always order the chicken burrito , it's moist tender chicken breast that is always consistently awesome! Healthy light and clean food at its best!"}
{"text":"Oh man I just had a good fish taco here and a great green chili burro. I should have got a few more tacos though. Yes, try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Another place that is delish! I absolutely love the employees. I know Amy and she is such a doll, which is why I like to support this place. The chicken  tacos are on point and I love the enchilada sauce. Pretty sure my friend just ate an entire bottle of the salsa, while I prefer to dip because of the heat it carries!  Dog friendly patio is nice as well!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you see the colorful beauty of Mexican art. It's clean, organized, and lively. The choice of music is perfect. They played rock en español and other popular Spanish music. It is refreshing to hear this. It was also refreshing to see that the staff is bilingual, friendly and acts with a sense of urgency.  I ordered albondigas. It came with flour tortilla. Absolutely Delish! I would like to try s spicy version of albondigas. The tortilla was in point. Warm with perfect consistency."}
{"text":"Some Burros is pretty darn good. I usually keep it simple with a carne asada or machaca burro. My friend and I ventured outside of the usual burrito/enchillada and tried to Mexican Pizza. It was pretty friggen bomb. AND it's cheap too! I would recommend ordering ahead because it takes a while and the guy servers can be a little creepy. Other than that this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"BLEH. That's really all to say about Someburros.   The only reason I came to this place was because of an unused gift card that I had for over a year. I ordered a common Mexican food item: a carne asada burrito.   The steak was bland, the salsa was okay. I think the only good thing about this place was the chips.   Save your time and money and take your business elsewhere. This is a very mediocre Mexican food restaurant that I am not even sure how it stays in business."}
{"text":"Someburros has a damn fine veggie burrito that I highly recommend.  I used to always get their tacos too, but I would ask them to put black beans in them instead of meat.  Don't knock it 'til you try it.  The restaurant is small, but their prices are reasonable and their portions are very generous.  I used to come here all the time for lunch in college with my roommate when we worked as telemarketers (one of the most horrible jobs on earth). But it helped to pay the rent, despite how much we hated it. And the thought of having a late lunch at Someburros (and maybe a margarita using our fake ID's) was the only thing that got us through our day."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Its really good food at a really good price.  The service is fast and the staff is friendly!  My favorite item is the Beef Green Chili Burro and the Burracho Burro. Love the chips and salsa you get when you get there.  Free refills on drinks too!"}
{"text":"As a Native Texan, I have higher standards for Mexican food. Even when it's the cheapest in town, it ought to be a step above cardboard. My beans were clearly canned, the taco shells were burnt and the lettuce was limp. On top of that I suspect the only seasonings available under that roof were salt and pepper. The meat was dry and burnt and the rice was hard. The plates were paper, which is okay for fast food, but from the outside it didn't look like a fast food place, But as soon as you walk in you see the chain maze for the line and the menu on the wall, should have walked out right then and there. but the worst thing of all was that my chips and salsa was actually chips and hot sauce. they didn't even have real salsa. it was in a squirt bottle if that gives you an idea of how liquidy it was. it was not the chunky salsa i expect at a mexican place. terrible.  I cannot think of any place in my lifetime that has had worse mexican food, and I lived in GEORGIA for seven years. Even the peach state had better mexican food.  I wouldn't say that it was unclean, just standard fast food levels of sanitation. decor was terrible, and atmosphere was meh.  never again"}
{"text":"I just stopped for a breakfast burrito after shopping at Trader Joes. It was great! I had never been here, will definitely be back. Great food & super friendly service."}
{"text":"Really like this place. People are super friendly and actually care!! What a concept. It's fast and hot. Not earth changing but really good at a very fair price. What else could you ask for."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago where you can find delicious, authentic Mexican food everywhere (hint: none of it is in downtown Chicago), but I had yet to find a solid place out here in the Phoenix area near me. Then, my work ordered lunch from Someburros. The taquitos (aka flautas) are great, the steak burro is awesome, and the guacamole is mild and flavorful. I haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried. Their prices are VERY reasonable and you can even order online for pickup."}
{"text":"If I'm in Tempe and I want a mean bean and cheese burro, this is the place I'm going to go.  To me, there is no better place to get one."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The carne street tacos are delicious. The service was friendly and personal."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to get food in the area. Highly recommend trying their frozen margs cause for 4 dollars it's a great deal! Really great for college kids that are on a budget."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick-serve Mexican place, this is it.  Food isn't memorable, but is served within 5-7 minutes.  They also offer a drive thru."}
{"text":"Amazingly good Mexican food for the price. The atmosphere is cafe style with a comfortable feel - much nicer than most of the taco shops around town.   The salsa they give you with the complimentary chips is amazing! The taco and tostada were perfect, the rice and beans dead on.  A great lunch destination in south Tempe."}
{"text":"I would give Someburros a 4, but I feel like it would be misleading. In my mind a 4 is a \"I need to go there\" rating. Someburros is more of  a \"If you want mexican food and you're nearby\" type place  Another reviewer said it best; this is a 'tweener place - better than fast food, not as good as a sit-down... which I actually find perfect.  While they're food is perfectly acceptable, I will say that it's easy to spend more than you need to here. I've gotten a few of there combos of burritos, tacos, etc, and while they're good, you are probably going to cross (or very nearly cross) the $10 mark once you add a drink. personally I think the most underrated thing on the menu is the Mexican Pizza. It's a 14\" cheese crisp with green chili beef, tomatoes, and green onions. It has plenty of flavor, it's def. filling, and it's cheap - $4.80. (this is also perfect Hangover Grub.) Add a small drink, the comp. chips, and you've got a pretty great meal for a hair under 7 bucks. Not the healthiest option in the world, but hey..."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for good fast inexpensive Mexican food. The green chile burritos are the best. Portions are good chips & salsa included."}
{"text":"Two words: Pollo Fundido.  Wear your fat jeans or sweats and go eat one.  Then go home and take a shower, unless you like to smell of grease..  Love this place.  Never disappoints. .   If the line is long, call the take out line and order while you wait.  Your food will probably be ready by the time you get to the counter.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The staff was friendly and retaurant was clean. I made a food order to go for co-workers. I ordered the Pancho Villa. Presentation looked good. It tasted decent. My friend also ordered the Pancho Villa and we both commented on how the there was layers of the tortilla. Its like they use extra large tortillas and quadruple wrap them to give a little girth. So if you peel the layers away its really not that big. Every thing tasted ok but didnt blow me away. With Mexican restaurants being a dime a dozen I probally won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Love the food (and that you can get breakfast all day), the drive through for call ahead orders, and the margaritas.  I agree with the previous review about the ballsy birds. Don't feed them if you don't want them to join you."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have a quick bite to eat if you're in the mood for Mexican food, and the chimichangas are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place rules, my favorite fast mexican place. I get the veggie burro, it is bomb. Avacodo, beans, salsa and cheese. Salsa is good... Overall, great place to grab some good, quick grub."}
{"text":"Quick, authentic Mexican food. I come to Someburros once in a while. Maybe not so unexpectedly, I always have, well, \"some burros.\" (apologies, I had to!) But, seriously, I don't think I have had any entree except the burros. I think I have had EVERY burro on the menu, though, and I have enjoyed them all.   The Pollo Fundido is rich and good if you like a little spicy -- I like to augment that one with the hot sauce that you get with the chips, which also helps cut the richness of the cream cheese. The Crudo (machaca and green sauce) is my go-to burro, but I wanted to mix things up and had the Borracho (green chili beef+covered in green sauce) this time since I wanted something smothered in green sauce.   If you like a lot going on, the Rod Burro has it all: green + red + beans + chorizo inside, then topped with more red and green... and melted cheese. I usually have to mentally prepare for something complicated like that.   The horchata is pretty good here , but there are no refills. From what I have seen around town, that is pretty standard, but good to know if it is your first time here.  It is a no-frills place, but the food is consistently authentic and served hot and pretty fast. You get chips and hot sauce to snack on while you wait, so it doesn't usually seem to take that long."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie burro with sour cream, it was delicious. The salsa that they give you on the side could be slightly less watery, but its fresh! The establishment is clean from what I can see, and the staff is friendly. I don't like that they charge $1.25 for a dab of sour cream."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at the Tempe and Chandler Mall Someburros for years.  A family owned restaurant with old family recipes.  You order at the registers then they bring you the food, so it isn't fancy but, it is delicious. The prices are super reasonable and the usually have a daily special.  My kids love the bean burros or chicken taquitos.  I love everything from the big burros, pollo fundido (like the sauce on the side), tacos, tostadas.  My favorite are the refried beans. I am not a big fan of the rice but my kids like it.  At our annual Cookie Exchange with my Tia's we serve the mini-burro platter (red, green and bean).  My family is Mexican-American and they eat the eat them up."}
{"text":"Went in for some lunch and got a deep fried chicken burrito with cheese. It was pretty good, as were the complimentary chips and salsa. For the time of day they had a pretty steady flow of business but they were fast with the food. I'll probably check them out again and maybe try something different."}
{"text":"Fantastic veggie burittos, wonderful cheese quesadillas and great salsa and chips.  We ate there regularly when we lived in Tempe and we make it a point to stop by every time we head back.  The drive through window is a nice plus!"}
{"text":"The service is always super fast and the food is consistently great.  My personal favorite is the BORRACHO BURRO. It is a green chili beef burro served enchilada style with green sauce.  It also includes guacamole and sour cream. It isn't spicy enough for me so I pile on the fabulous red hot sauce they provide with the chips and it makes for the perfect burrito.  The chips are awesome and the sauce amazing (complimentary if you eat in).  I enjoy the outdoor patio when the weather permits and I have never ordered anything that I didn't like here.  The price point is great taking into consideration the quality of the food, the quantity of the food, the service and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Good quality fast food Mexican lunch for a reasonable price. It's consistent and it's clean. I like that they have gone green with real plates, silverware and glasses. Free chips and salsa when you dine in. The salsa is actually hot sauce and I like it.  I had the No. 1 combo which is a taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans. It's served very hot, meaning right out of the kitchen   It's not a fancy restaurant, but it's 10 notches above a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Gilbert location before so I remembered that the tacos were good.  Was scoping this place out at least a month before it opened....it was like a Mervins commercial....OPEN OPEN OPEN!  Well, it finally did, and the tacos are still good! For a semi fast food joint the food is well above average!  Crunchy tacos are delish..beef and chicken, rice has a good flavor, I don't really eat beans so their beans are ??? And the other items other ppl were eating looked good.  Guac...not bad and better than expected. Chips...decent. Salsa decent.  Like I said, GREAT for what it is. Two thumbs up for clean and super nice service!  We will be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place. You walk in and it's a fast food experience when ordering and then you sit for 39 minutes to get your food brought out. The service wasn't very good and my Ponch Villa had no meat in it for what I paid for. I'm willing to try again and modify my review but as for now I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"Breakfast was a little bland, service was good, probably won't return for seconds anytime soon."}
{"text":"Le décor est très bien et une belle terrasse.  Le service est très bien.  La nourriture est bonne mais pas exceptionnelle. J'ai malgré tout aimé mon expérience à ce resto."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 shredded beef and 2 chicken tacos on line.  The price on line says $2 a taco but the receipt I got shows $2.65 per taco.  Called to let them know and they said it might not be working on line.  Offered a gift card if I came back in but I was already home.  Anyway, buyer beware, check your on line total before you pay and at the store."}
{"text":"The one fantastico thing I can say about Someburros is, the hot sauce is wonderful. Otherwise, they aren't very good at getting orders right, and if you try to order something custom, they will immediately become annoyed with you and rude.  My child, like most kids, will only eat very plain items.  I've been going there for some time and have been trying to customize simple orders for her...For example, mini chimis with no toppings, but they still can't ever get it right.  I finally tried to eat there at the restaurant with a family member, and they couldn't even make her the right item she ordered.  So when she told the server that it wasn't what she ordered, the server actually talked her back into taking the item he brought out.  The couple sitting directly next to our table had the exact same problem...ordered one thing, got another.  Adios Someburros!"}
{"text":"bad bad bad bad bad.....no don't eat here! i don't  know how this place stays open. you cant just throw some beans, rice and salsa on a plate and call it mexican. staff is really nice  i feel bad they have to serve that stuff on a plate. do yourself a favor and go some place else, any place will be better! run run away from this eatery!"}
{"text":"I e been eating at Someburros for almost 20 years. I've been to all their locations and the food is always great!  I love their hot sauce and chips. I also love that they switched to real dishes and ditched the styrofoam and Plastic. Much more green!"}
{"text":"Decided to take a break from Chipotle and check out this local chain. We got a few different burritos and tacos. I'm a sucker for good Mexican and this was pretty darn good. I mean it's semi-fast foodesque, but not so much as Filiberto's.   I've only had my meals to go, so I can't comment on the dining experience, but the staff has been helpful and I like it when they include lots of sauces! Arrriba!"}
{"text":"The Pollo Fundido is AMAZING!! I get it every time I eat there!!"}
{"text":"Great place the food is awesome .  The staff are wonderful best customer service I have got in a long time. After long week of work I go every Friday night. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food was great. Good prices and friendly staff. My husband loves the tacos and enchiladas and I really like the 3 way burro and chicken burro. The salsa is the best. Love it! Good place to come try it sometime. There are other locations, in Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe. I have been to all and always loved the food."}
{"text":"I love Someburros. The chicken burrito is so tender and moist. We also ordered a open face cheese crisp with green chilis. Yum! U have yet to find anything bad there. This was their original location but...... there are many , many  more. Give them a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I have never gotten anything that wasn't good. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting. There salsa is so.... Good it goes  in everything. My favorite is a chicken burro juicy yum."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the best quality Drinking Straws that I have ever experience. Durable, nice color, all around glorious!  Food is good."}
{"text":"We have used them several times for a company meetings and they do an excellent job and most of the food is always eating"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for everyone at my office. I arrived at the drive-thru but somehow the drive-thru isn't really a drive-thru. Let me explain. There is no menu board nor a speaker to talk to. It's just a window. That makes no sense, right? So I decided to just park and go inside to pick up my food. I ordered my food and was about to leave when I looked in my bag and there were no tortilla chips. The employee was giving out free tortilla chips to the ones dining in at the restaurant. So I ask if I could have a small bag of chips. I was told that I would have to pay a fee for the chips if it was a take-out order. What is up with that?! So I reluctantly pay because you got to have chips with a Mexican meal. It's just tradition! On my way to the office, I noticed the bag sitting on my car seat was drenched with fatty oil that it soaked THROUGH the bag onto my leather car seats. Gross! So I arrive at the office and we all started to eat our lunch and we realized that the restaurant must be using lard because the flavor of the fat was so strong and distinct. Someone had ordered a chorizo burrito and the chorizo was completely burnt. My chimichanga was drenched with some red sauce. The spices in the sauce (cumin) was so strong, that it overpowered all other flavors. I could not eat it. Someone had tacos and they were dripping with fat. At this point, we all decided to throw the food away. It was not edible. I wish I would have not wasted my $35 dollars here and I could have donated my money to charity. A complete WASTE.  Don't listen to the other reviews exclaiming how great the food is. I've been living in Phoenix for over 30 years and have NEVER experienced such disgusting Mexican food. Don't bother wasting your hard earned money here.  If I could, I would give this place ZERO STARS. The only thing going for this place is the decor, but who cares about that if the place serves disappointing food. I know good Mexican food and this is just not it. I would rather eat at a taco stand in down town Phoenix than this place. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"So I ate at this restaurant.  Here is a story to tell.  This man named Ernie approached me and what a guy the towel flowed out of his pants with extravagance.  He asked me \"howwww you doin.\" I said fine thank you very much.  He then walked away politely and said \"let me know if you need anything.\"  I said actually some cane's sauce would be great.  He said sorry this isn't McDonald's.    Then his buddy Jack came around the corner and said \"no Ernie you mean Burger King.\"    I about died and left them a nice tip after enjoying my amazing burrito.  Service was fantastic.  Shout out to BCJ.  Definitely come again"}
{"text":"This was definitely an experience! I had the taco salad and it was to die for.. so crunchy and full of flavors also it came out fast!"}
{"text":"Great fast serve Mexican.  All made fresh.  Love the El Diablo breakfast burrito and their beef tacos."}
{"text":"Man I cannot get enough of this place! Everything is amazingly delicious. My only complaint is that if you order through pick up they do not give you any chips and very little salsa.   I suggest that they change their policy and throw in a bag of chips for free come on man!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Someburros and overall it was average. I came on opening day and it wasn't as busy as I expected. The wait wasn't very long and we got the food fairly quick. I got a chicken chimichanga with the green sauce-- chicken lacked flavor so I added a lot of their salsa to make up for it. You do get free chips beforehand, which was nice. The strawberry margarita was average. The interior is beautiful and the atmosphere is nice as well. Overall it's a 3 star location."}
{"text":"One of the better semi fast food Mexican food experiences.  Chili Verde and chili Colorado burros get thumbs up."}
{"text":"We always love the food!  Tacos = delicious Tostada = delicious Rod burro = magic Pretty quick service to...esspecially with how busy they are."}
{"text":"Good little Mexican fast food restaurant to get food you thought to-go window in a hurry period or always a nice place to stop and get a taco and a margarita"}
{"text":"This is a great place for taco and burritos.  It is family owned, and the waitstaff are always very friendly and upbeat.  Love their tomatilla sauce!"}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty food. Watch out for the salsa it packs a punch."}
{"text":"First time here. Got a Carne asada burrito, chicken burrito and a cheese quesadilla. The Carne asada burritos was acceptable,  has some fresh guac and pico. The quesadilla was fine, but just cheese and a tortilla,  very difficult to mess up. The chicken burrito was literally just flavorless chicken, not another ingredient.  Nothing here was nasty, just many more better, local options for sure."}
{"text":"If you've ever had el torito or Acapulco's here in California that's what this food taste like. Watered down , bland like do they use salt here?!?  I'm from Los Angeles and I've eaten real Mexican food.  This food is not authentic Mexican food folks. Not a fan of Arizona Mexican food places I have yet to find one worthy of calling it Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is never consistent  !  All their employees need to get on the same page especially on the take out orders"}
{"text":"Best most juicy meat ever! Makes the Burrito that much better! I order here at least once a week I can't get enough! Took my brother here yesterday and he was instantly hooked. I found this place in accident and I'm never looking back!"}
{"text":"Cross between a sit-down restaurant and a fast food taco shop. Food is served on real plates hot from the oven to your table, but you order at the counter & therefore save money on tipping. Food is greasier than I prefer but tasty. Delicious squeeze bottle salsa & chips included with your meal. I love that they offer Mexican breakfast - I'll be back to try their version of chilaquiles!"}
{"text":"Someburros is one of those places that gives me pause. I've had poor food here before, but it seems to be specific items (their chicken), as other items are quite good.  This is definitely a gringo place. Everything starts bland, but you get a very nice hot sauce to put on whatever you like. They make a perfect quesadilla, but they call it a folded cheese crisp. (This is a nitpick, sure, but a cheese crisp should, I don't know, be crispy.)  Every meal comes with chips which are tasty. Their enchiladas can be greasy, but I'm not sure if that is a complaint or a good thing. I enjoy their ground beef and potato tacos, but again they are hella-bland. Keep the hot sauce handy. The beans and rice in the combo platters are solid winners.  This location uses ceramic plates and honest to god metal cutlery, but the Tempe (Mill) location uses foam plates and plastic cutlery. In my mind, this says a lot for the location. Neither method of serving/eating food impacts the flavor, just the atmosphere. I imagine the Tempe location may save a little money on washing dishes/cutlery as a result.  In the end, Someburros is good if you want Mexican food, at a good price and are in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Though when looking for a bargain, I have gone a little out of my way for the Tempe (Mill) location."}

{"text":"Horribly slow here with food, and some items were just downright foul (eggs in the breakfast burrito).  Hot sauce in the plastic tube was good though, as well as the spicy tomatillo sauce.  No real drive-thru.  What the heck?"}
{"text":"Just ordered from Someburros once again and i'm disgusted and disappointed for the last time. We ordered a bowl of albondigas soup, a kids egg and bacon burrito and a machaca and egg burrito. When we got home the albondigas soup bowl was only half full and when we called to let the Miguel, the manager know he admitted they only fill the soups half way because they give rice on the side but even when we added the rice all it did was soak up the juice and leave it half full still. He was very rude and seemed to not care. Also the kids bacon and egg burrito was completely burned with very, very little egg. Someburros on Gilbert and Stapley is a poor excuse for a restaurant and the manager doesn't care about the food they serve especially when ordering to go. My family and I will never give our money to this place again. The 1 star is only because I had to rate this sorry place otherwise they don't even deserve that!"}
{"text":"Someburros is a Mexican restaurant with a clever name that has been a local staple in Tempe for over a decade.  I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered the carne asada burro which was more refried beans than meat wrapped in a cold tortilla. A modest serving of chips is complimentary but they seemed stale and bland. They came with a squeeze bottle of salsa but no container in which to dispense so you have to squirt directly onto your chip.  I was disappointed that sour cream wasn't complimentary. Even more disappointing is that it costs $1.50 which is kind of ridiculous. Prices otherwise are on the low end. An enchilada plate and burro totalled under $18.  I will say the cheese crisp was simple and tasty. They also serve frozen margaritas."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This is one of the best burritos or \"burro\" I've had in a looooonnng time."}
{"text":"Overall this place isn't so bad for a quick mexican food place. It's not like eating at a restaurant or anything like that. The food portions are pretty great and sold at a fair price. I really liked their salsa and I felt it was nice and flavorful. I'd say this place is a small step up from Filbertos.  The staff here, however, were really rude. They seemed to want to rush everyone around."}
{"text":"This store front is new and the place shows, clean tables, floors and bathrooms. The place screams \"non authentic\" but the food is still great and well priced."}
{"text":"This is the place I go for Mexican food in the south tempe area, the prices are good and the place is clean! Love the enchiladas and burritos. Recommend the tea!"}
{"text":"This may as well be our kitchen, we seem to eat more here than we do at home:)   The staff is always awesome, the food is really good and the price is just right.  Really like the ability to get restaurant quality food, with complementary chips and salsa, without a server.  WE LOVE SOMEBURROS!"}
{"text":"had the bean burro. can't really mess up beans, but their hot sauce is too tomato-ey and not spicy enough."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Mexican restaurant for a while now. Great customer service! Everything I've tried has been good. Highly recommend."}
