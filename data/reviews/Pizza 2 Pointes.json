{"text":"Pizza is always good but they're cheap. They sent a small fry as the biggest one they have, even when we called to complain and ask for a decent size fry they responded as that is the largest fry, you would know when you received a small fry. I mean a five dollar Poutine has just as much fries as the largest fry So the only reason I even bother to give a star is because the pizza is decent. Just don't rely on delivery times or service."}
{"text":"We used to order from here at least once a week at work. For the past few times they have gone completely down hill. Previous order; food and drinks were forgotten about. When we called to let them know, and asked if they could have someone deliver it we got \"Well we're really busy right now\" as a response. Rude. This time, we ordered before the lunch rush could even start, (11:38) and over AN HOUR LATER WE had to call THEM and ask what was happening? 
Same response \"We're very busy, be patient\" - We received our food an hour and half after calling, and food was cold. We ordered very simple things to make. Lettuce on the chicken burger was wilted and browning. 
Will not be ordering from them again, that is for sure. 2M has the same menu items, and A LOT better service."}
{"text":"Very decent pizza, a small pizza joint you would least expect to please. But it does good pizza for very little cost."}
