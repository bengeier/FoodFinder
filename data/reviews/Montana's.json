{"text":"The food here is good.  If you are in the mood for generic food that is homey and close to home this is a good choice.  A better family alternative than Swiss Chalet for sure.  

We ordered 2 kids meals which came out pretty quick... What all parents need.  

Our order was also out quick.  I recommend the Beef Sliders.

My only dissapointment was the way my family was greeted.  Upon arrival at 545 ( an early res) I asked for a booth. I was then asked 'well, how about a half booth.' it's not what I wanted so I looked around and noticed 5 booths open.  I said ' is that one open?' and the greeter said 'well yeah...'. She then took us to the worst booth next to the kitchen door. I asked her why she tried to put us in a half booth then this crappy spot and she said that it wasn't fair to the other servers who needed more customers in their area. What kind of logic is this?  it sounds like servers come first rather then customer experience.  I questioned my server on this and he confirmed this is an almost wierd supportive way.  


My reco on this location is to ensure you look around when beig seated and insist on the best table possible. 

Food is great, but atmosphere needs help like music of any kind."}
{"text":"Being from the States, I have to say that this place was very average (if not slightly worse than average).  

I was in town with co-workers and a few people were craving classic BBQ meats and something non-ethnic.  We decided on this place and made our merry way to Mississauga.  

No issues with parking and this place is located right off the freeway.  You walk-in and the place feels sort of like a western themed bar and of course the smell of BBQ is int he air.  The tables have brown paper where the wait staff write their name on it and serve water/drinks in jar glasses.  

I ordered the smoke house pork ribs, with poutine and coleslaw.  Our food didn't take long to arrive and everything looked really good; at least on the plate.  The poutine was alright and I really liked the corn bread.  The ribs themselves were fine, but nothing that truly wow'ed me; it simply doesn't compare to the great BBQ back home in the States.

The food was so-so and the service was good.  if you REALLY want BBQ, maybe stop here; but do yourself a favor and find something else in town."}
{"text":"My stomach is beginning to rumble right now so I better make this a quick review.

I ordered their quarter chicken with coleslaw, fries, and corn bread. The quarter chicken was alright...nothing amazing that I would rave about. The corn bread tasted like a mediocre cupcake and the coleslaw and fries were poor. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the twice-baked potato smashers. His experience was worst compared to mine because he only finished half of his sandwich because it tasted bad and the meat was dry. Also, the potato smashers doesn't look so appetizing compared to the picture in the menu. 

I wish I could tell you one good thing about Montana's but I would be lying. No wonder I don't go here...because it's bad."}
{"text":"We come here about twice a year when our kids have the craving for ribs or I want to eat chicken wings.

The decor is outdoorsy.
Our kids like the sheet of paper 'tablecloth' as they usually play tic tac dough on it.

Staff are friendly.
Food is OK especially when you are hungry!

The only problem is after we leave, the fried stuff gets to me.

Our food bill this last time was a little higher than other cuisines.
We had a steak, 2 lbs of chicken wings and a salad to balance things and it came to $70 with no alcohol but with tax and tip.

It's fun to come by when one of our kids is celebrating their birthday because they get to wear the moose 'hat' and get a birthday song sung to them!"}
