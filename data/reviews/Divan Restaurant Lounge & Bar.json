{"text":"Yesterday we were at Divan restaurant. The worst food I ever seen . Kebab has a bad smell , shandiz is so greasy and a small amount of meat .kaskebademjan has no taste!! At all.
And the worst part we ordered white fish the same as write in their menu, their bring a small fish that has a very fishy smell. I told them it's not a white fish, they said bcz we don't have we bring bass instead !! And today all of us have a diarrhea."}
{"text":"The food was not good the kebab tasted like fish and the only good thing out of this restaurant was the appetizer I wouldn't come back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"We received a vey friendly and professional service in Divan restaurant. 
They have live music on Saturdays and  an amazing show. We had a really great time in there. 
The food is above average. I cant say its something fantastic but decently good. They have a greek appetizer, I dont remember the name but its the first one on the menu 14$ :)) well I actually liked it because I love cheese but its not the best option for someone with a persian taste. 

While we had a very good time in there last night, there is still something that bothered us very much. 

There is apparently a policy that they charge 20$ for cake service no matter how many guests you have. 
We were celebrating a birthday with in a group of 6 adults and a very small cake. So we called them just to ask about this policy and the manager was not polite to my sister. I mean, they are working on so many aspects to be perfect but yet the manager is a huge drawback himself. 

But still, we enjoyed the night."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friend hosted a lunch for a close 60 of her girlfriends at Divan.
I must say the food was very delicious. I enjoyed the kabob and chicken. I also like the decor and the location was right off the 407.
The service was fast and efficient. Dessert was yummy
I'd go back"}
{"text":"This is the best persian restaurant in the entire GTA. The food and the service is absolutely amazing, I was astonished with the customer service and most definitely the delicious food. They play great music and the game dancers as well. 

This is a place where I would go with a big group of friend and throw a huge party. The restaurant has outstanding decor, great place to eat and party! 

Our waitress had great customer service and checked if we were doing okay very often. I was completely blown away and had to leave an honest review! 

Thank you Divan!"}
{"text":"The decor and service is good but food was ok specially kebabs were very dry and not perfectly cooked.  Shank was fine.
The not so good part was bread (pita) not fresh at all. They don,t make it on premises for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out the restaurant. We are vegetarian and there was basically only a couple of options for us. the vegetable kabob plate. and some salads. we opted for the vegetable kabobs. we asked the waitress how it was prepared she said the vegetables were grilled/bbq'd. sounded yummy enough. the plate comes with salad, rice and potatoes. the greek salad arrived first. a wonderful proportion. the plate arrived soon after. again, the proportion was a generous size. I would say great value. however, the vegetables looked 'anemic' they were definitely not fresh. It was from a vegetable medley frozen package. carrots had that defrosted rubbery texture. cauliflower was mushy and brown. there was a random broccoli in there. I was expecting chopped onions, peppers, tomatoes grilled on a stick. 
The potatoes were ok. a bit bland. the rice was that Uncle Ben's style rice. While the service was pleasant, I honestly did not enjoy the food. The waitress saw that I left the plate and asked if it was ok. I was hesitant but politely explained that It was from a frozen packet and I just did not enjoy it. She said , 'no no' . I said, 'it is' and I could not eat it. She asked if the chef could prepare another plate for me. I was already full and put off. Plus, I did not see how another defrosted plate would make my meal any better. 
We were charged for the plate. At the end , the waitress politely said, 'hope to see you again soon' like nothing ever happened. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"DIVAN restaurant,I ordered a kabab kobide and the rice was very salty and in kobid was lots of unions and filling it when eat it.
For one kobide and one coke I paid $22,60.(kobide was $16,95)
And the service was bad and unprovincial and late,
I am not going again to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and it was quite empty, and there was 80s music playing loudly. Had heard that it was a good restaurant, and wanted to try it out. The kabobs were okay, but in my opinion there are better and less expensive Persian restaurants out there. 

Despite being not so busy, our server was forgetful, and not attentive. When we had ordered take out for one of our family members at the end of our meal, he had forgot to punch it in. We had to call another server to ask where our dish was after 30 minutes, and we were told the order was not punched in. After finally waiting until this matter was attended to, the food finally came, and we got the new take out bill which was about $18 for a koobideh dish, my mom opened up the take out container and noticed there was only two skewers...no grilled tomato, no bread, rice, or anything else. My mom was kind of shocked since there appeared to be two menus, one for take out which was obviously less expensive, and one for dine in. Of course we didn't mind paying the dine in price, if it had come with the same side dishes, and possible presentation as what we had just eaten.

Once we told the server of this, he immediately realized that he \"made a mistake\" and did not punch it in as a take out dish. Obviously if you make these kinds of repeated errors on a not so busy dining time, maybe you should not be a server.

Overall, would never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, food is perfect and the service was excellent.
We will definitely come back for those delicious koobidehs."}
{"text":"Here's another honest review from a genuine customer not a friend of the owners. Four of us got to our table at 8pm. We decided to try it out for desserts. Ordered 4 desserts (different type of cakes)and I had asked for an  espresso to be  brought with the dessert, after 10 minutes the waitress brought the espresso by itself then after 25 minutes waitress came with 2 desserts then after another 15 minutes she came by with another one. And took off, so we assume  she's going to get the last of the desserts...... Waited another 20 minutes or so and nothing. When we asked whats going on, she blamed another waiter (even though she was the one that took the order) she said it's his table I'm just doing him the favour. So, basically took close to  an hour to get 3 pieces of cake.... That actually turned out to be average (not even really tasty). I was originally planning on trying them for a dinner but after the horrible experience, I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend  them to anyone. If they don't get their act together and improve, they won't last longer than a year."}
{"text":"The worst Greek food I've ever tasted. So disappointed the restaurant, food definitely tasted better before."}
{"text":"Wonderful service with amazing food. You can't find any better Persian restaurant in Toronto"}
