{"text":"Expensive but it is nice to have stuff in the freezer for when we don't want to go out.  The quality is high and consistent.  Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Well, tried it and decided not to go back....Pretty bad customer service...The steaks were OK, not great.  Hamburgers were terrible and hot dogs worse.  In my opinion, the supermarkets meat is almost the same at half the price."}
{"text":"For Christmas, my husband and I received a gift package of meats and doggie cookies.  The meat was good, but our puppy looooooooooooves the doggie cookies, he will run straight into his crate when we ask him if he wants a cookie!  So once we ran out, we knew we had to get more.

Originally we looked online for the cookies not knowing there was a location in Charlotte.  Well I decided I didn't want to pay $12-13 shipping just for some dog cookies.  I then realized there was a location in town, called them up to see if they had to cookies in store - sure enough they did and they were 50% off!  We stocked up and will be back when we run out.

They of course wanted us to buy the meats or something else, but I'm a bargain shopper and their meats aren't the best priced.  No problems with customer service at this location like others have suggested."}
{"text":"A buddy's big birthday is around the corner and we were looking for a unique gift idea.  He loves to grill and eat, so this seemed to be a very logical choice.

Initially, we thought we could just order something and ask for it to be packed in a shipping container, then we would wrap it in a bow and deliver it. Duh, doesn't work that way other than online.  However, once we saw these cute little gift card coolers, we knew we had a winner winner chicken (or steak) dinner!  So now we have a unique bbq - themed gift, packed with tissue in an OS tote bag with their Spring catalog. Nice.

Isiah went to great lengths to help us out, very patient.

BF browsed the store, which had lots of sales and special offers and came up with some snack goodies to take home, Hunter's Sausage sticks (fresh tasting and not at all like dry slim jim sticks) and summer sausage. But there were plenty of other steaks, chops, seafood, seasonings and more to select.

Overall, nice little store and good shopping  experience."}
{"text":"This place is way way out of my way but the salesman,Luther, made it worth my while. He's awesome and very knowledgable about their products. Keep up the great work Luther!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative 5 star review I would. I got a $100 gift card for X-mas, and I have now been to this store twice trying to use the card. Both time they had NONE of the good sale items advertised in the web site. Today I went with 3 different items in mind that I saw as better deals on their web site, and they had NONE OF THEM! I asked if the had any of their new King Cuts they promote on their web site. They had NONE, of their supposed BEST STEAKS. What's the point of having a store that does not have ANY of their best deals? 

I've gotten gift cards for this place for several years, and not ONCE have I gotten ANYTHING that was worth the money they ask, even on their BEST SALES. Are there really that many STUPID IGNORANT IDIOTS in the world? How do these people stay in business? 

This has to be the WORST business model in existence."}
{"text":"I ordered the $49.99 Groupon, great deal, been wanting to try Omaha Steaks for a while now. So far so good, had the 2 filet mignons with my wife last night which were excellent. Had the 4 burgers tonight which were good, definitely can tell the difference in there meat in comparison to grocery store meat. Still you can't beat fresh butcher shops, since Omaha is frozen but for frozen it's pretty damn good can't complain. Still got a couple steaks left, chicken, and pork chops! Only con I had was the man in the store wasn't too enthusiastic, He just sat behind the counter and acted irritated, wasn't super social, with me being a first time customer that wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"Several years ago we ordered bacon wrapped Filet Mignon from Omaha Steaks and it was very good.  The steaks arrived in a Styrofoam cooler with dry ice, packaged beautifully.
Then I found out that there is a local store here in Vegas, so I had to check them out. The store is small and well organized with freezers along two walls. Purchased my 4 Filet Mignon for $40. Unfortunately, they tasted terrible and there was so much fat on each.  How does a Filet Mignon have so much fat?  Isn't supposed to be lean and tender?
I will not buy any steak from Omaha steaks again."}
{"text":"The customer service is god awful. ..I assume Robert (name tag) is one of the managers...The first time I went in he was training new employees. .. Very rude to them.  The second time I went in he was very rude to the customers including me.  I have been a loyal customer for several years & the staff (management) has gone down.  I like how convenient the meat portion/packaging is but I absolutely hate going in the store.  They have another manager (Shawn) same sinerio...rude. I made a purchase with him before & kindly asked him if he applied my points and he said,  \"it's too late, I already rung it up.\" I always spend $150-200 every time I buy there. I was just there on Sunday & I'm not going back. .. Going to the Butcher is much better & great customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up the Father's Day T-bone special.  Art knew exactly what I was looking for and I was on my way in about 15 minutes. Always a wonderful experience was I visit here..Great  job Art"}
{"text":"I work out of town some so my wife needs quick meals that she can prepare for her and my daughter. This place always has some good options. If you're ever board and don't know what you want for dinner, swing by Omaha Steaks and something will get your wheel turning and next thing you know you've got an awesome dinner to take home. 

Today when we visited I signed up for a \"Weber Steak Cooking Class\" I'm excited about this!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times to pick up steaks, lamb chops, and all sorts of sides to BBQ.  The staff is excellent and can steer you in the right direction if you're confused.  The prices are a bit high, though, and you're getting frozen meats.  I'd really prefer a good quality butcher shop, but unfortunately I haven't seen one in the area, so Omaha Steaks will have to do for the time being."}
{"text":"This store is very clean, neat, and obviously well maintained. The guy behind the counter was friendly and professional, but a little too eager about upselling. I know it's part of their job requirements, but when I say \"That's All\" I mean exactly that. I take it as an insult when my courteous refusal of any more products is met with the typical high pressure sales tactics. It turns me off immediately. I had a coupon for one of their packages for $49.00 because even if I was rich, I would NEVER pay the retail prices Omaha charges. There's no reason good enough to me, why anyone would pay several hundred dollars for a few steaks. I don't care if the cows they came from had diamond-studded utters, or gold lined a**holes, who in their right mind willingly pay that kind of money for a hunk of meat.

When I got home I cooked up one of the filets and one sirloin. The filet wasn't bad, but the sirloin had a weird texture that gave it a strange taste. First of all, if you're going to sell what is advertised as premium meats, go the full route and sell fresh, not frozen. I grew up with real butcher shops that always sold the best meat anywhere because it was always fresh. To be honest, I will continue buying my steaks at the grocery store because going toe-to-toe, it's better tasting beef for a tenth of the price. And the simple reason for the huge difference in taste and texture, is because it's not frozen - the minute you freeze meat of any kind, the fundmentals of that meat is changed to something it was never meant to be, I don't care what anyone says. I will not be returing to Omaha for anything in the future. I wanted to try them for a long time, I did, and was disappointed."}
{"text":"I never saw one of these stores at a retail location,  just thought they were online so we stopped in to check it out.  Enormous selection of pre-cooked meals, easy to prepare as well as regular items.  Also all the sides are separately packaged as well with sauces, gravy, you name it.   We were impressed to say the least.  We tried quite a few since then.  Some of the prices were real good and others a little high but there is always some discount or special going on.   Things sell out quick, I found out that Friday is usually delivery day, so stock up.  This place is great to change things up and enjoy a good meal that's easy to prepare.   We tried, chili, has a little  kick,  chicken fried steak very thin and tender, chicken fried chicken, tender as well, beef stew, delicious and the mashed potatoes, individually packed, very nice.  Service is great, very helpful finding anything you need and showing you each item in the box before buying."}
{"text":"First visit to a retail store.  Associate was very friendly and helpful.  Store very clean and well organized.  Great to be able to buy without trying to figure out free shipping options.  They will also match most online prices if they are better."}
{"text":"I came here with a gift card and left with a mountain of meat! The store was having a 50% off sale which allowed me to indulge in some private reserve ribeyes. The marbling on the steaks looked too amazing to pass up! They were also having a buy 1 get 2 free sale on selected items so I got some tenderloin tips, beef pot roast, and brisket burgers. So far I've tried the pot roast and ribeye steaks.

The potroast came preseasoned in a bag. I decided to add some Omaha Steak brand mixed vegetables ($2.99 on sale) for an easy meal. The instructions were simple and it was a quick meal to bake in the oven with no prepwork. The potroast was tender and flavorful. The vegetables were decent, but were understandably a little mushy since they were frozen. 

I followed the instructions for grilling the private reserve steaks, grilling first, then finishing it in the oven. The meat was tender and juicy with good flavor. 

Mannie and Jon provided excellent service. Jon even carried my mountain of meat to my car for me. What a gentleman!

Overall the meat products they have here are good, but the price (Even on sale) is too prohibitive for me to buy from them on a regular basis. The beef here is corn and grain fed, and I would personally rather pay higher prices than normal for grass fed beef instead."}
{"text":"I had actually never tried Omaha Steaks before, but a groupon popped up and it's very close to my house, so I decided to give it a chance. I was expecting more of a butcher shop, and although it did have some frozen cuts of meat, it has more prepared frozen sides/appetizers/entrees ect. 
Jon is the person who helped me navigate the store and he was very nice and made sure to tell me about all the manager specials and deals. 
It is a little expensive, but quality. As Jon says, \"you'll never go to fry's again\".  I will be back"}
{"text":"Usually buy from this location of Omaha steaks but the manager/owner at this location may be one of the rudest customer service people I have encountered. She would not honor a coupon redemption that  one of her employees stated was fine, was sent by Omaha corp. , and was well within the time limit for redemption.  It's a shame because their steaks are good but with The Meat House, Enzo's and several other butchers in the area, I have no need to deal with the shoddy customer service here."}
{"text":"I ordered online:
Filet Mignon Pastry Bites
Filet Mignon Artisan Flatbread
Raspberry Chipotle Brie Bites
Steaks
Breakfast sausages

Pastry Bites aren't very flavorful but we ate them.
Flatbread was inedible and we tossed it.
Brie Bites were ok but wouldn't order again.
Steaks - We don't get the hype.  I get better steaks from my Fry's butcher.
Sausages are ok but wouldn't order again.

Big disappointment with all."}
{"text":"I don't know how to give this place anything less than 5 stars; the place is so small, that there is no room to make a mistake.
Their storage room has got to be twice the size as their front room.
But, even in the front room, there are lots of frozen steaks, twice-stuffed potatoes, etc..
Their was one girl in there when I went, and she was very attentive.
It's got to be an easy gig, because the product sells itself. They ship everywhere.
I freeze, defrost and eat a lot of steaks, I mean a lot.
But I'll never understand how their steaks defrost so quickly. It's almost like they defy the laws of physics.
I took out one of their frozen steaks and one of my frozen steaks (of comparable size), put them on the counter, and the Omaha steak defrosted in less than 2 hours whereas mine took more than 4 hours to defrost. If anyone has an answer for that, I would get more sleep at night.
The steaks are small, and I find myself eating a minimum of two per meal, but they are definitely restaurant quality steaks at more reasonable prices than restaurant prices.
I love the organization of the products (I'm obsessive compulsive), and I love the way they pack the steaks in Styrofoam with dry ice during the warm season(s).
I think that I covered everything."}
{"text":"You just lost a loyal customer because of horrible customer service. I'm sure you don't care but I just want everyone to know your employee left me standing at the check out for family too long. I just wanted to pay for my food."}
{"text":"All Omaha Steaks stores are the best for delicious high quality meat and seafood. They really can't be best. Great for gifts or just a wonderful family meal. I personally refuse to eat meat from anywhere else."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law sent us a package for Christmas and now we are hooked.  I hated how long it took to deliver though so we found a store on Rainbow in Las Vegas NV.  They honored all of the deals found on line.  This is the best meat and deserts I've ever had.  Lasagna is great too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I just recently discovered that there was a store here in Vegas. I have heard of Omaha Steaks before, but for some reason I thought that they were an online retailer only. 

It is pretty expensive. The two times that we shopped here, we spent a little over $100. But trust me, it is worth every penny! As Matt S. had already mentioned, there is always some kind of sale or two-for-one deal going on, so you will never have to worry about paying full price. Also, they told us that if we ever happen to find a better deal on their website, just print out the page, show it to them, and they will match the price.

Everything is frozen and nicely packed in boxes, but the meats are really really good! The employees are always very friendly and helpful, although I'm still wondering if they work off of commission? Anyway, they explain a lot of things to you if you tell them that this is your first time in the store, or if you don't have much experience with cooking meats. Forrest was the employee who helped us. He explained some of the different cuts of steaks and gave us a handy \"Steak Cooking Chart\" which tells you how long to cook a steak and when to turn them on the grill.  

Our favorites are the Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignons and the Triple-Trimmed Filet Mignons. Very juicy and tasty! We tried their Chocolate Molten Lava Cakes for dessert, which I thought was okay, but probably would not buy again. It seemed much sweeter than what I am used to. I want to try the Tiramisu or Cheesecake next time. I also bought a package of their Canine Cookies, and my dog loved them!

Yuuum, I want to go back already! This place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This store caught my attention while I was having lunch next door. Even though I'm a foodie, I've never had an Omaha Steaks before. \"Let's go check it out\" he said. Since it was over 110 degrees out and I had no where to go,  why not? 

I was in shocked to see that all products were frozen and packed in boxes (again, I didn't know any better). First thing that caught my attention was the prices. I saw a box of 6 (Filet Mignon) for $300. My jar literally dropped. I ended up getting 4 pieces of Omaha steaks (9oz), a box of mash potatoes (8 of them) and a bottle of Omaha steak sauce just to try out.  

For the first time in my life, I've tried THE almighty OMAHA steaks. The first bite really got to me. It didn't taste like steaks that I normally had. After my 2-3 bites, I was in love. Why does it take so long for me to try something so heavenly??? Oh mama...gimme more. 

I gave it 4 stars mostly because of how tasty the steak was. My experience here, however, wasn't so great when we first walked in. I choose not dress up often and usually walk around with tan tops, cheap bag and a pair of sandals. I save my money on travelling and food rather than clothing but that is just me. Since we didn't dress up with fancy clothing, I guess the first sales guy who spotted us didn't feel like we were going to buy anything. We walked right by him and he didn't say one thing to us. As soon as someone else (well dressed) walked in. \"Oh hello! How can I help you?\". Seriously? The ironic thing was that person turned out buying nothing and left. Thankfully, another sales guy asked us if we needed help as soon as he was done with another customer. He was super friendly and helpful. That totally made up for the attitude we were given to. 

I'll definitely come back here again for some good steaks, but next time I will only buy when that nice sales guy is there."}
