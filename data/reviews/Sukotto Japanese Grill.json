{"text":"Actually ZERO star. If they want to do a mini Teppan-Yaki then make sure your system runs smoothly. It was a chaos! Your customer should not wait for the food for the average of 20 minutes in a food court. And your food is bland or too spicy."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Japanese food I have ever eaten. The woman taking the orders was rude and totally unhelpful when I asked questions. It seemed I was annoying her. The cook was sweating everywhere and kept wiping on his apron. He went to the back and carried new bags of noodles and shrimp out with the same gloves he was preparing food with. Then used the spatulas he was cooking with the slit across the tops of the bags to open them. He left my beef on the grill the entire time I watched all this so when he went to break up the meat it was hard and crusty. I essentially got burnt balls of beef and I'm sure some sweat dropped in for good measure. I finished my drink while waiting so asked the rude lady for a refill. She put another scoop of ice in and filled it up with pop ( the ice was touching the lid she put so much in). If I wasn't in a hurry with four hungry kids waiting for me,  I would've demanded a refund. I will NEVER return here again."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had... Chicken Teriyaki? Nah.. nasty food, bad service."}
{"text":"This place is awful, the portions are so small it's ridiculous paying almost $8 for rice, over-cooked vegetables and a tiny bit of bland chicken is a terrible rip off. The cashier was so rude; we couldn't hear what she was saying and when we asked questions, she scoffed like we were stupid for Even asking the question. The cook on the grill was clueless too. Don't spend your money here, it's a waste."}
{"text":"They forgot the noodles to my noodle soup and the soup was tasteless.  When I asked for noodles and more taste they gave me the same bowl of soup and a little bit of noodles"}
{"text":"You know it's a bad place when the cashier says he's not going to be working there much longer.  My friend ordered the teriyaki bowl.  They forgot the broccoli.  When she asked about it, she said they don't put it on.  When she complained, they pulled broccoli out and threw it on the grill for 30 seconds and tossed it on top.  It was cold/charred at the same time....NICE!!!!! I got broth and asked for nothing in it.  It came full of soggy veggies.  I had to pick them out.

The man handled the noodles with his bare hands and had a band-aid on....health code violation!!!!  They don't clean the grill between grilling chicken and shrimp.  God forbid your allergic to seafood.  Maybe people like their shrimp tasting like chicken.   MY daughter went next door to Far East Asian Fire ran by the same company.  Let's just say we got our money back at both places.  And let me say this.....the food has to be really, really bad for me to give 1 star and for me to ask for my money back."}
{"text":"I haven't tried them in a long time but I do like the sauce nice and hot over beef, rice and vegetables.   So I ordered and let them know I was finding a table.  

Came back with my young one and they had given it away.  When I asked they said I had the food.  Hmmmmmm.......so they rudely made another one and kind of gave me a stink eye.  Geeze!

Next time I went they were out of beef/steak.  I asked for a coupon or discount as I drove a long way.  They said rudely, \"no we don't do that, next time you should call ahead\"!  

Good advice, we should contact food places to verify they carry what they promote before we go!"}
{"text":"Worst fuckng customer service ever , they NEED to start checking  receipts  before giving out food. I ordered my food and they let someone else take it. I asked the cook why my number hadn't been called yet , he replied \"the boy took it\" mind you I wasn't with any anyone. After I turned around , the cook yelled at me. Also the women that gave me my refund was rude & disrespectful. I'm not the only one who thinks this place is crap by all you're reviews."}
{"text":"Worst teriyaki chicken I've had. No flavor, expensive and it takes forever to be served. 

Do not eat here trust me."}
{"text":"*Keep in mind, this is 4 stars for a food court dining experience. 

I am SO surprised to see so many horrible experiences at this great place. First, I must start out by saying that AZ Mills has completely improved their food court options and I found it hard to choose where to dine! 

When I saw Sukotto making fresh teriyaki meals to order, I was sold! My teriyaki bowl honestly weighed about 10lbs and was jam packed with fresh veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli, onions, etc.), noodles (you have a choice between rice or noodles), and the most delicious teriyaki sauce. I am not a big fan of thick teriyaki sauce and Sukotto nailed their version. I thought that my bowl had a TON of flavor, especially when I added Sriracha. They make fresh sushi right there as well. My ONLY (and very minor) complaint was that the noodles were a tad over-done. 

I would absolutely, hands down, eat here again. Not to mention, the lady working that day was nice and working SO hard to get all of the orders out as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Horrible. I asked for shrimp and chicken, they said they were out of shrimp, I said ok, I asked for noodles, somehow they were out of noodles, until I said can I get my money back, so cashier asked manager what to do, cook goes in the back, and what do you know, he had a handful of noodles.  Was cold, and didn't Taste well at all.  Never going there again."}
{"text":"Overpriced trash. Teryaki has no flavor, and employees are constantly getting orders wrong nevermind that there's a screen over the grill. Save you money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Do not go here, I repeat! DO NOT ORDER YOUR FOOD HERE!!! The food has no flavor. It takes forever to get your food cooked and a very small portion! Very disappointed. We should've checked the yelp reviews diary before coming here."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! I couldn't get my yelp up to see the reviews smh... but they gave me five shrimp and the mixed vegetables was mainly cabbage. Sloppy how they throw your food on the plate. Service sucks! If I could rate 0 I'd give them a ZERO!!! TERRIBLE AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place at all cost. Should've checked my Yelp before ordering here. Lots of bad reviews about this place. Took forever to get my food with only two people working. Then as they're cooking my noodles, the cook used the same spatulas that he just used on some raw chicken. Then after mixing the raw chicken, he proceeded to use the same utensil to scoop my noodles into a to go container. Needless to say, I wasn't happy about it as I didn't want to eat this stuff and get sick. As such, I ended up throwing away my food after complaining about it and went to get a tuna wrap at another place. Definitely won't go there again."}
{"text":"Food sucks.  Bland food, mixed vegetables are just cabbage, low mein noodles are spaghetti and you have to ask for napkins.  They basically toss the food in the container and push it across the excess food along the counter.  I was going to choose Far East asian fire next to them, now Im thinking I should have.  Pass them by, food is bad.  Zero stars at best."}
{"text":"I am sad that i was ready for some good food and i am not usually picky and complain but..... i was very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"It is not real Japanese food! I can tell because I am a Japanese. I ordered Noodle soup of  bowl. It sounded like Ramen. But It never use Rice noodle in Japan. The soup is horrible. I know there is not alot of Japanese restaurant here But If you say It is Japanese, then try to make or study real japanese food otherwise people misunderstand what japanese food is."}
{"text":"I went back for sashimi and noodle soup. I think this is the only place that you can get noodle soup. I will check again. 

The flavour almost bland,  that's why they give you soy sauce...Lol..."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The food is ok but the hispanic cook and server are rude. I will never come back to this place again unless those 2 people are gone. I feel sorry for the owner!"}
{"text":"Quick service, hot food, but undercooked rice.  Disappointed.  Ate it anyway because I was hangry."}
{"text":"Great experience when they were in my building as a Fooda pop-up. The chicken teriyaki is fantastic! I hate when Japanese food is swimming in sauce, and this chicken is so flavorful with teriyaki without tons of goopy sauce. The sobe noodles were perfect and I loved the vegetables. Yes, it is mostly cabbage, but I really love cabbage so found it delicious. VERY reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I had to download the yelp app to my new phone just to explain how horrible this food was. If you pay $7 for a bowl of essentially 'chicken noodle soup' it really should not be a bowl scantily filled with tenden laden crunchy lumps of dark chicken 'meat' and floating pieces of nasty looking chicken skins. There was other random bits oily nasty broth and even though I was told they were going to call my number when ready I had to get tapped by another customer asking me if that was my food sitting on the counter. (hint it was)"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to make our food, with no apologies, they even served a guy behind us. This is the first and last time we'll eat there."}
