{"text":"I've worked in the Yonge and Bloor area for a long time.  Everything here is bland, expensive and/or too time consuming.

The Vine Leaf is an excellent alternative option.  For under 10 bucks including tax I always get an extremely delicious and filling meal. The chicken shawarma plate is my meal of choice, but it's all good really. It's fairly busy but the wait to get my food is always under a couple minutes and as you can see in the pictures there's a comfortable area to eat your food. Also it's worth noting they have great customer service.

At Vine Leaf I'm able to have a decent meal, for a decent price, all within my designated break time.  I come here once a week. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was craving shawarma today, and tried the Vine Leaf based on the good reviews here.
I ordered ahead using the Ritual app, which means it should be ready when I get there.
They had not even started to put my wrap together, and he stepped away from another customer to quickly get it ready (I had to basically re-order, even though I had already entered everything into Ritual). He rushed to put it all together, and it ended up being the messiest wrap I have ever had. I think 1/2 of it ended up on my desk, the floor, and my sweater.
On top of that, the chicken in the shawarma was over cooked - dry and tough.
I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week, and it was *delicious*. I had a chicken and rice dish that was really tasty (I don't typically expect that from a food court).

Staff was friendly.  Chef cracked a few funny jokes while preparing my plate.

Price?  Seemed average for a plate of food in a food court...not sure what else to say here.

Perfect lunch!  Would return."}
{"text":"I was in the area one time during the lunch hour & couldn't decide what to get. I looked around the food court & this place looked the most reasonable & appetizing. I got a dish with rice & ground meat that kind of tasted like chili to me. Anyway I liked that they had different sizes available & I got the small. It was a decent meal in the crowded food court."}
