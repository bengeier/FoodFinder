{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I really did.   2 Uber orders, one customer in front of me and 6 more behind me. Two tables were waiting for their food. They came up twice to see what the hold up was.  It took close to 40 mins for my take out order of two sandwiches and a poutine. Uber driver got so fed up he left and told them that he's cancelling the order.   Sandwiches were good. The poutine was super salty."}
{"text":"Visited them over a month ago. The food was great, service was friendly. They helped us choose from the wide menu selection. I got the black and white burger which was awesome. Loved the special ASAP sauce! The poutine was real good too. But the best part of the meal was the milkshake!! Got the oreo milkshake it was awesome! Definitely the best Ive had in the city. We will definitely be going back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"As a poutine fan,  I'm quite critical with my poutine. Just had a curry chicken poutine and had to give these guys a shout-out. Well done."}
{"text":"Our family loves ASAP!  The Notorious is a hit with both us parents and our picky toddler who loves 'the yummy sauces'.  We always recommend ASAP City to visitors and friends!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Big Cheese Burger ($8.85) and the Papa Joe Burger combo ($12.45). The Big Cheese was tasty but was made with poor quality meat that had a lot of fat.. While I realise that burgers can be a lot more expensive, for a $9 burger, I shouldn't really be having to remove fat from my mouth after every bite.   The Papa Joe Burger was not as tasty as the Big Cheese in my opinion. It had a hash brown that smelled and tasted like it came out of a freezer and the lettuce was wilted. My favourite part about this burger was the delicious Master Sauce that came with it!  PS. I ordered these online and the delivery was on time  PPS. This place is halal!"}
{"text":"Large servings. Sauces are phenomenal. BEST PHILLY CHEESE STEAK IN TORONTO.  Nutella shake is amazing.   Only reason I'm giving 4 star is because the fries can be much better."}
{"text":"I visited ASAP City this past Sunday at noon with a friend of mine who was raving about their sandwiches and in particular the \"Red SAP\" - a tandoori chicken filled sandwich.  I had the Philly steak - you probably know what that is.  First off, these are stuffed sandwiches.  Kind of like a pita but there is something different about it.  Other Yelper's were disappointed with quantity but I got mine with fries and was stuffed.  Basically, my sandwich was steak, veggies and cheese inside a half pita (or whatever).  The fries are McDonald style, thin and crispy.  I liked it.  I ate it all.  But I wasn't raving about it the way my friend did.  I'll try another one next time.  Decor:  fast foodish set up in a warehouse with the floor peeling away in sections - maybe this was intentional but of so there must be a better way.  Overall, worth checking out and supporting this new Danforth/Woodbine sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Hey!! I got the milkshakes and I asked, are they finished? Because the menu advertised whipped cream on top, but they don't come that way, even though they are served in a dome lid cup.. what the heck!?  Good thing for them that the Red sap sandwiches were delicious! The milkshakes cost almost as much as the sandwiches...  I'll be back for another sandwich! The shake was good but not 6.95 good. If the next meal is just as good I'll increase my review."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 chicken W'sap minus the pita wrap. So we requested everything in a bowl. The Indian guy with the glasses is rude and ignorant while taking the order. Took 20 mins to make two of these bowls. We asked for spicy, it was not spicy, the chicken was undercooked. By the way it was 10:30pm so place was empty. The guy gave us just the chicken with a slice of cheese on it. When we asked about the salad it's suppose to come with , he said not anymore since they \"changed the concept now\", my friend ordered same exact thing 2 days ago. So we had to ask for salad which was just lettuce and ONE SLICE OF TOMATO. I paid $22 for an empty bowl with just just few pieces of chicken with cheese slice on top . Only came to the place becoz it is walking distance. Never again. Save your money and go to the pizza place next door. Or anything else but this. Overall , horrible service, good was uncooked, and this Indian guy is stingy to give you a slice of tomato. Don't know about other locations but this place was awful and waste of my money. Never again."}
{"text":"I had something similar to a tandoori chicken roti. It had a name like w'asap. Anyway, I am here to tell you it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. I highly recommend you try the w'asap sandwich. It is big enough for two meals, and has interesting things in it like green olives."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I had the Red'SAP and the other half had the Chick City. Tandoori chicken was tender moist & very tasty. Looking forward to trying the poutine. Lovely addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I've tried 3 of their sandwiches since their opening last week. The Philly Melt: great tasting, full of steak, cheese and peppers. Try the homemade hot sauce that comes with it... Fantastic! Next was the W'Asap: tons of chicken breast marinated in a mild curry, caramelized onions and green olives. This was my favourite so far. The onions and curry made a perfect blend. Finally, the Black & White: mix of steak and chicken...was just kind of boring. All 3 sandwiches were great overall and I will be back for sure. Think I'll wait a few weeks though cause they just opened and are a complete clusterf#*k behind the counter. Especially at lunch on a Friday! I have waited at least 15-20 mins each time I've been. Worth it in the end but 3 stars for now until they clean up their act."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for 4 milkshakes, even with the insistence we had time constraints. The milkshakes weren't amazing and couldn't justify the long wait-time.  If you're planning to eat here, make sure you can afford to wait a while for your food to be prepared."}
{"text":"The best dirty veggie burger I have had in a long time... maybe ever! Junk food bliss. The milkshake on the other hand was meh. Portions are MASSIVE, btw."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite, got the sweet city wrap combo. Love their food but it always takes a really long time for them to  prepare which would be understandable if they were busy but I feel that their cooking tactics are just not quite efficient enough. Like for example me and my boyfriend usually get a wrap each, and they come at different times."}
{"text":"Just had it on Friday. They have a special every day. Had the curry poutine it was delicious. Also had a Philly chheaesteak sandwich. It was delicious and the pita was packed. But have to say the price range is a little high. However if you get the daily specials it's more than worth it. Definitely a spot to cone back to. Pretty clean inside and decent seating. And halal."}
{"text":"ITS HALAL!   Hard to find good halal burgers, and this place doesn't disappoint! Not the best ever, but a solid 3/5 Milkshakes are DELICIOUS!!!!  I would recommend for a late night eat!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Customer service is absolutely amazing. Super affordable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is what i have  to say. My first  impression  wasnt good from the broken door and tiles, it gave me the idea that this place wasnt well kept.  Honeslty outside of the  entrance, rhe store was well kept, clean and nice  decor and layout. Washroom werent a mess either.  It wasnt that busy, thou i was 3 pm so i could missed the lunch rush and it was a slow period  but atleast that meant there wasnt a long wait maybw 10 mins.  What  drew me.to this place is its interesting  take a sandwich. While making a sandwich in pita bread isnt unique nor is sticking a burger  in one. The favour  and taste was there. It has to be one of best i had and it wasnt messy. Definietly coming back. They variation  of sauces is good and there  is more i want to try"}
{"text":"Just ate from there, and I was thoroughly impressed. I had the Philly sandwich and it was really good. Also tried their burger (as how I'm a burger fiend) just to compare with the rest in the area. I got the Big Cheese. Not Burger Priest or Burger Stomper quality, but still pretty good. All in all, great experience. Definitely will be going back to try the rest!...I also liked the fries!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I have to tell you it isn't worth it. The first time I decided to get the Philly cheese steak, where the meat was overcooked and it took about 25 minutes to get our food even though the place wasn't packed.   The second time I got a cheeseburger, which is as simple as it gets, but again the burger was overcooked and chewy to the point where I couldn't finish it. The fries tasted quite similar to that of McDonald's (and I don't mean that as a compliment at all), and the gravy that I got on the side was runny and tasteless.   I would rate the service 6/10 because the staff definitely don't seem to not want to be there and it shows."}
{"text":"We had half an hour for a quick bite and this place advertised \"a new take on sandwiches\" so why not??  We LOVED this place so much we came back for seconds! We tried three sandwiches (R'SAP, W'SAP and Chick City) and they were all delicious, and packed with meat. The vibe at this location was cool - big screen playing Fresh Prince of Bel-air, which we loved watching while waiting for our food. We saw a couple of families and a few groups of friends who were enjoying the food and atmosphere.  Food came quick and delicious. Price point was decent for the originality, portion, ingredients, and excellent service. They also have some good dips for their french fries!"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times now and both my wife and I love it. Great work! It's definitely a much needed alternative from the usual everyday halal joints serving the same average food."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the review done by BlogTo, so I thought I'd give a try. The menu was very effective in giving you what would be on your burger. I wanted to go all in by giving The Heavyweight, 6oz all beef paddy with fried egg, cheddar Cheese, lettuce,tomato and Onions. Added $3 more for fries and Drink. I was good, filling but not overstuffed, but I probably would have added a paddy or two more to truly make this a \"Heavyweight\" burger.  The ingredients were fresh and Beef was well seasoned and the sauces made the flavours stand out a lot more. I guess I was expecting a larger burger like that of Whimpy's restaurant. Because when you say Heavyweight, one expects a larger item. I give this place a try again for the poutine, since these guys are from Montreal, it should be the best. Time will tell. See you guys soon."}
{"text":"This place is A W E S O M E!!! I ordered the staple which was the tandoori special and lucky me it was actually the special of the day so the combo was $10 all in - great value! It was delicious - even their fries and all their dipping sauces are soooo yummy! Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place for two years now and it wasn't until I asked my RMT at a place down the strip (Origin Wellness) where I should grab a quick bite.  I ordered the Wrap'Tor combo and it blew my expectations.  SO FLAVOURFUL.    And good fries (similar to McDonald's).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went on Monday and had the daily special;   OK, so this place is is deceiving, walking in a was a bit sceptical, there was one kid working the counter anyways gave it a go.  Awesome, for a sandwich shop they make all meats fresh in front of you, veggies fresh, very SAUCY, need a plate and utensils.  A must if you haven't been, i regret not getting onion rings - next time for sure."}
{"text":"The food actually tastes great, but it does take a long long time to make the sandwiches.I tried the Red Sap which was delicious and had the Philly Cheeseteak as well which was comparable to some of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Is you see this place keep walking, very very bland food and the menu is much of the same with different takes, I'd give it another year before you read the sigh out of business."}
{"text":"Pharmacy Ave and Lawrence Ave location was pleasant and speedy service. The server was very personable and answered questions well. Food was great quality and tasted very good. Portion sizes were huge. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a new spot in the neighbourhood that was previously a Shwarma and falafel restaurant. They shut down and reopened a few weeks later as ASAP city.  Their two main menu items are pita sandwiches and burgers. They offer a veggie burger and two salads that seem more of an afterthought than anything else. Poutine is also on the menu, but we'll get to that later. They have 14 of the ASAP pitas and six burger types. Several of the pitas incorporated Burger patties but I can pass on those pretty easy. I have so far tried the W'ASAP, LeFrench, Philly Cheese, Black and white and the ASAP poutine. All have been good bordering on pretty damn good with the W'ASAP being the best and the LeFrench being the most forgettable - though the chicken from the pita does work well on the poutine. The size of the poutine is easily shared by 2-3 or a meal for one. I am a fan of the food overall.  The tables and booths are roomy and plentiful, there is an outlet at every booth for charging and the large TV is forever playing Friends. The place seems like it's an effort by a group of friends as it's always the same guys behind the counter. In quieter times they always ask for feedback on the food and seem interested when you give  it. Asap City is a welcome addition to a neighbourhood sorely in need of good food options, and they're open late Fridays Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Great selection of eats. Burgers are Bomb. Need better drink selections. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"ASAP City is a no frills fast food restaurant. The decor is functional and attractive. The service was friendly.  I ordered the cheezup sandwich combo. It is a panini sandwich filled with onions, beef, and cheese that has been pressed. It was tasty, but could use more seasoning. The fries came with two sauces that were delicious.  If I were in the area again, I might come back. But there is a lot of restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"There's something so satisfying about philly served in a pita  although on a bit expensive for the portion you get."}
{"text":"Had zero complaints with the food. Every single item we ordered was fresh and delicious! Ordered the red'sap, heavyweight and swissilicious sandwiches. Fries and nutella shake were great too... Glad to see location in Scarborough.  Will definitely come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"FAST FOOD.... greasy .. very drippy. not my type of food ...one friend got the Hamburger the beef was nasty .... i got the le french sandwich it wasn't OKAY 2 Poutine was good..."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my choice but for $10 the \"Black and White\" which is supposed to be Half Chicken/Half Beef was definitely not worth it. There was barely any meat at all. Its all layered on top of mostly loose shredded lettuce. I bought into the hype and was pretty disappointed especially when I can get a shawarma packed with meat for less practically anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went here a couple months ago on a late night and there's so many delicious options to choose from. I got the What's up Wrap and was impressed with the flavour as well as portion. They have a daily special so one day I'll come back here and stuff my face. I love the wraps here!"}
{"text":"Quite expensive for they quantity and type of food.  Small place only one person works has to cook and be at the cash as well. Worth going there for lunch on week days"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, front desk was unhelpful, cooked everything very slowly, handled food with unwashed bare hands, threatened to withhold my food for longer and when asked to speak with a manager I was told by (the sever) that he was both the manager and owner of restaurant, refusing to give me a contact number for someone I can speak to and refusing to give me his name to report him.   Would not eat there ever again."}
