{"text":"I have had one of the best dishes here at this restaurant. The gyro's are really good. The dolmades are fantastic. Great vibe. Good service. Outdoor seating available. I have been here so many times. I make sure to visit every single time I go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for happy hour and greek food:  The Mad Greek gets it right.

Large menu, especially happy hour stuff, which the staff is more than happy to describe for those of us that don't know what things are.  

HH menu consists of $4 to $7 goodies (about a $1 off the normal prices).  Ordering 3 items is usually plenty for 2 people.  There are drinks as well ($16 pitcher of mojitos is legit), but be sure to inquire if you're not sure what's included.

Some favorites:  hummus, baba, tzazkiki (veggie platter), chicken skewer, gyro snack (open-faced gyro sandwich, sans \"fries\"), and the mussels with clams.  Essentially everything I've tried has been pretty tasty.  

Next indulgence on the list: the goat cheese flambe looked and smelled delicious.

The down: it can be slow.  Although, tell the waitress if you're in a hurry or want something, and they're pretty attentive.  That said, we usually order everything at once since we know it'll be a while until we see them again.

So, if you're hungry, have some time to kill, and want to indulge in a decent beverage, this is a good place to pick."}
{"text":"update: called the Resturant and spoke to the manager. Jerry was very nice and was very sorry for the disappointing food. told me to come back and try again.. he was very nice and I'll take him up on his offer. 
I'll post another update!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this four stars even though the food doesn't blow my mind or anything.  I go here because of the awesome happy hour, the kitschy atmosphere, and the entertaining wait staff.  I can take my kids here and no one blinks an eye if they make too much noise.  Families are welcome and celebrated.  

I also stop in and pick up take out a lot.  Their tapas menu is excellent.  I hope this place is around for a long time."}
{"text":"While the food took longer than I had anticipated in the drive thru, I was pleasantly surprised with the veggie burger & fries! It really was unexpectedly yummy!"}
{"text":"Fast food version of Mad Greek on sahara and Durango.  Best appetizers such fried artichokes, wrapped grape-leaves, shrimp/crab puffs. Clean and beatiful.  Try fried artichokes with cucumber sauce"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant like if a freakin greek temple was a dance club.  Love Pelmini (dumplings in lemon sauce), stuffed grape leaves with meat gravy, crab roll-a-snacks, even juicy chicken wings.  Ton of tasty Greek tapas"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery and my falafel sandwich came without the pita bread....so it was just some falafel. The baklava was extremely small & not even cut all the way through. Very disappointed. Seemed like my order was thrown together, regretted tipping so much."}
{"text":"I had a voucher for 30.00 that a friend had given me so I thought I would  check it out.  We sat on the patio on a Friday evening around 7:30.  The decor is beyond tacky, which in a strange way is kind of cool.  The service was ok, but just barely.  Indifferent is a better description. I ran out of iced tea several times and waited at least 10 minutes each time to get a refill.  NOTE:  Their iced tea is sort of raspberry flavored...period.  We ordered hummus and pita, which was really good.  Next we ordered two appetizers, the Greek pizza and some sort of avocado, feta, spinach on a pita thing, both of which were ok.  The baklava was ok.  
There were quite a few customers who came in who seemed to be Greek, and they got attentive service.  The music was kind of cool.
I will try it one more time, but I am not very hopeful that my experience will be better.
Perhaps the one in Baker is better."}
{"text":"Food was not that tasty and definitely not worth the price. The man who took our order seemed to be in la la land and I had the urge to whack him on the head. The rest of the staff seemed a little out of it too... maybe the manager wasn't there? 
Any who, not worth going to."}
{"text":"I just moved from San Diego California to Las Vegas and by far this is the first restaurant that serves amazing delicious scrumptious food on top of all of them the best customer service I have received in Las Vegas thus far thank you to my server Jen I look forward to becoming a loyal customer great food couldn't have been more tasteful just right the lemonade was above and beyond tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place, I have been eating here for years now. The always care for my vegan needs. Always have food ready for when we have a birthday at my firm @ De Luca & Associates, which is all the time lol. I love Greek food! This place is the best, they make u feel like family :-)... Thanks all!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and lamb kebab and their baklava is to die for.. Happy hour every day also with outside sitting"}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout Gyros or a side of gyro meat to go.  The gyros are fantastic imo.  I can't tell you how many gyro places skimp on the meat.  I always order double meat because of this.  Not necessary here!  Don't do it!  Impossible amounts of meat lol!

My only complaint is a side of feta is ridiculously overpriced for the tiny bit you get."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! Great food and good spirits! They put quality in and love into each meal. And not overpriced. :-)

Oh, and you've got to try their homemade baklava.. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Ive usually never had a problem with this place. I have dined in and received deliveries. Im a little upset because I requested delivery and received the avocado with artichoke hearts, but the avocado wasnt good, it was bruised and wasnt ripe. Then, I go to eat my gyro and it was burned? and my coffee even tasted terrible. Which is a SHOCK to me. And, I even got charged extra for some reason??? Anyways, Im just disappointed. Maybe it wasnt someones day today at the restaurant, but I was really looking forward to enjoying the delicious food they have provided to me before."}
{"text":"Are they still serving the all you can eat buffet??? Visited here a couple of months ago and it was not very good. It felt like I was somewhere in Eastern Europe. Is this really a Greek restaurant or has it changed hands? Just asking, I remember it being good and want to try it again. HELP! The servers kept insisting that I order the $20 buffett, the guy was annoyed that I wanted to order from the menu. The food was not that good, I di pay the $20 it was not worth it. Again, mostly Albanians running the place. I guess the only Greek is the name. Hope that the food and service improves."}
{"text":"We had this place 3 days in a row- 2 times a day. The best gyro I've had, very sweet baklava. amazing."}
{"text":"This review is for the Mad Greek Primm, NV \"stateline\"
Food is ok, not great or craving to come back. Every table had a bottle of tapatio on it, this should be a clear message they are not serious about Greek food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed..it's too bad, we enjoyed eating there and enjoyed listening tonGary Columbo sing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant recently closed it doors.  The food was great, nice size portions, and the entertainment,  Gary Columbo was a wonderful singer.   We just had dinner there on Thursday, and it seemed like business as usual.  Finally found a restaurant worthy of frequent visits, and it's gone."}
{"text":"I will never understand the hate fest this place gets on here. Let me start off by saying I could care less about service other than food coming out in a decent amount of time and keeping my drink refilled. Other than that who cares? Im here to eat not have my ego massaged. The food wasnt made in Athens and transported here or anything but they had some good food. Gyro was really good, the meat was very well seasoned, the tzaziki was really falvorful. I also had the fried cheese which was great with the pitas. Paid 20 dollars and portions were more than big enough. Its a hole in the wall greek restaurant off the strip not a Jose Andres 5 star restaurant inside a 5 star hotel. Cant wait to come back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to the one going to LA on the freeway and it was great so I try the one here on Sahara and it was amazing great service great menu and the food was so good as well.. I highly recommend the combination plate so you can try everything ! plus trust me on this is enough for 2 people and I eat a lot lol!!!!!' The greek chicken  salad I had before was amazing as well !!!!!! Bottom line you want greek food go there it's as greek as it gets and I can say that course im greek!! Ps: I really want to try the fish dish they have .. some people were eating that and it looks amazing !! see you very soon again mad greek thanks for the wonderful service and food!!!!! They also have great music events so I have to go to that as well !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a gyro and couldnt believe how disgustingly dirty this place was. The service was just as bad, rude kids who didnt give a crap about what they were doing or serving. And then to charge $9 for a gyro...really. Never again!"}
{"text":"Bad service. I went to this place with my girlfriend the other night because there was a live band playing. We sat down and ordered two long island Ice teas. The waitress however asked us to walk to the bar and place the order with the bartender. Hmmm thought that was the waitresses job.   After placing our food order and 45min later We still had no entrees. However or waitress said the food was coming soon.  A half hour later she returned to or table and we were told that the kitchen had lost our order. I refused to wait another 45min for food so we left.  Sadly this was our second time there. The first time we at least recieved part of our order."}
{"text":"Eat here two days ago for lunch. What a  MISTAKE!!
Me and husband eat same thing the Gyro lunch special with fries...
FOOD POISONING!!!! Started with Diarrhea in few hours after lunch and my husband is still down, in bed ever since. I guess my stomach handles more. I called the restaurant to let them know, to warn them and try to avoid more people getting sic. The person I talked to sounded pretty bored with the news and told me that we probably eat somewhere else... Hm hm nice answer... We will never go back there again, and I will remember this for sure."}
{"text":"Closed lost lease
Last night sign on window, no lights, was in last week and everything ok. Loved the hummus."}
{"text":"Food was good. Meat was very tender and salad was a nice variety. I like the cheese in the salad. Delivery was fast. Food arrived in half the time estimated on the Eat24 app. The baklava was especially good. Very moist with lots of filling instead of lots of pastry. The rice wasn't the best and actually almost tasted instant and the price was high for the portion size."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Best greek food in Las Vegas. Forget Gyro Time this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go with my family all the time for lunch or dinner. Very clean and good service. I got the pita and humus with Tahiti as an appetizer, and the lamb-beef gyro as an entree. Absolutely delicious!! The meat in the gyro is sliced thinly, and very, very tender, so it's easy to eat! The pita bread is very soft, but crispy on the outside. Perfect texture!! I also recommend the coconut shrimp, even though it isn't exactly Greek. It's better than most sea food restaurants! I haven't been there at night, but I've heard it can get pretty crazy. The only things that kept this from getting a five star were the somewhat cheesy decorating and really big menu. Honestly, there's no reason why a Greek restaurant should be selling burgers and coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!! Look at my order on the pic! Kebab is burned:(((( I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"Had the best new Years eve party and Christmas party with a group of 70 people thank you Jerry and the whole team! With lots of love from los Angeles see you soon! And you deserve 10 stars!"}
{"text":"I have always driven by this place and never thought it could have the food that it does. On top of the quality of food their happy hour is 11-7. The coconut shrimp is awesome, the steak sandwiches are sick and the mushrooms on it are so gooood! Don't let the outside fool you, I mean it is called the MAD greek."}
{"text":"I always stopped at the Mad Greek in Baker- on my way to or from LA, but the location on Sahara and Durango is quite a bit different from that roadside stop.  It's a large space, with a pretty patio-- VERY Greek!  Statues and pillars all around- cute!  Food prices are good, and the menu is vast.  I like the traditional Gyro- and Greek fries are tasty.  Try the bacon wrapped dates and the spanikopita.  And do not miss out on the Date Shakes!! Super delicious!"}
{"text":"It's really good. Their calamari is awesome starter and when getting the gyro I prefer the New York style (not cause I grew up in New York or anything)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time order take out and sat on the patio for lunch... great place... the patio is a hide away Cove... great for lunch... lunch special are great!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the food and atmophere however the service is absolutely terrible. Major language barrier when ordering. Had to send order back two times.
When the owners brother is working and taking orders the experience goes a whole lot smoother. Great food however have zero expectation with the service."}
{"text":"I recently visited Las Vegas and a few of my friends who reside there. I was craving Greek food: good, homemade Greek food. My friend Chris said he has the right place for me. The Mad Greek! 

At first and after checking some of the reviews I got a little confused and hesitant because I know my friend is into fresh, healthy, and great food. To make the long story short I agreed to try it........

We got there about 8:00 P.M. The place was pretty busy for a Super Bowl Sunday. We were greeted immediately and with the most upbeat, welcome, and respectful way. We ordered Octopus, Greek salad, Saganaki to start and, for the main course, the Lavraki fish with Horta (dandelions).

Greek salad and Saganaki (flaming Greek cheese) was very good.

Octopus, out of this world.

Lavraki fish with Horta (Dandelions) was amazing, fresh and cooked to perfection!

I could not resist to order Galaktoboureko for dessert. Like my mom's. 

Perhaps most noteworthy, besides the truly exceptional food and service we received
from Irena, Elena, Rodney and the owner Michael, was the Music and Movie History on the walls, such as: 

(Michael \"Mikis\" Theodorakis who is one of the most internationally famous Greek songwriter of over 1000 songs and composer. He scored for the films Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico in 1973) 

(Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, Nikos Kazantzakis all participated in the movie Zorba The Greek in December of 1964) 

Thank you all for the hospitality, truly exceptional food and service!

I will see you next time and every time I will visit Las Vegas!

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for lunch to Mad Greek Cafe on Sahara St. in Las Vegas on Monday, 06/23/2014. We ordered Baba ghanoush and the Melitzanosalata (Smoked Eggplant Dip), which was like eating flavored tire rubber. Pita bread was baked on the grill with all the flavor of old burned cooking oil. We also ordered chicken souvlaki and beef souvlaki. I hated their amateur meat marinade. It seemed like they use the same marinade mix for chicken and beef. Mixed grilled vegetables were very bland. Rice was put on the grill before bringing it to the table, so it was dirty brown. Their food is overpriced compared to its quality. I regret spending almost $50+tip on such level food. The funny thing is that they were featured on Guy Fiery's Diners, Drive ins and Dives."}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced poor greek food.  I have been to every greek restaurant in town and this is by far the worst.  Save your money and time, eat anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Whenever I am on the road to and or from Las Vegas, I always make a stop at the Mad Greek Cafe. Its either that or KFC, Subway, and McD's. 

Chicken Wrap- Chicken is diced and served with tzatziki sauce. Only reason why I give it a 3 stars is cause the chicken is diced and not shaved like how you normally get at Zankous. Chicken at Mad Greek is not great but its A-OK and the pita bread is nice and chewy and fluffy which I like. The cucumber yogurt sauce that comes with the wrap is so addictive, I seriously place it all over my wrap and my rice. The rice that comes with the dish has good flavor too, not mush or firm. All the wraps come in a meal so you have to get a drink even though you don't want to. 

Shawarmah Wrap- Beef and lamb. I didn't order this but my friends did. They said it was good. The meats were sliced thinly and meat had good flavor. For some reason it looked dry to me but they said it was fine. 

Fried Mushroom- Must get! When I ordered it, the mushrooms were freshly fried and came with the yummy yogurt sauce which is a great pair with the fried vegetable. 

The cafe is not cheap and its not the nicest looking place. But overall, its decent greek food and is a place I continue to stop by because it became more of a tradition for me if anything."}
{"text":"Back for more deliciousness! This place reminds me of being in Greece. Their octopus is great! I also love their cabbage rolls aka lahanodolmade(sp) 

They have great zucchini fries and are not some cookie cutter chain! They are made fresh!! So service is a little slower because of that. When I see negative reviews about the food I wonder what people except for such affordable prices. 

I love the outdoor patio! 

Bottom line, if you're looking for a fun atmosphere and quality food give this place a shot but don't be in a rush because in Greece you have dinner for 2 hours not 30 minutes.

Extra bonus! All of their chicken is organic!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch 
The place was really clean 
Service was good
Food was so fresh 
Best calamari I've had 
Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I took my in-laws here for lunch.  Great food and wonderful service.  We had the gyro lunch special, and were very happy with the food."}
{"text":"I'm writing my review for The Mad Greek Cafe that is on the side of the I forgot which freeway on the way to Vegas.  I've passed by this place many times before but was very iffy of eating at restaurants in the middle of the desert in no-where-ville.  But after passing by it so many times and seeing all the Greeky decorations, I had to try it! After all, it has been standing in the middle of the desert for quite a while now so something MUST be delicious, right?


RIGHT! Not only is their gyro yummy but it is also jiggaanoormouus!!! The pita is soft and fluffy while the meat is tender and oh so delicious! Their menu also consist of not only Greek but Mexican food along with Mexican chefs in the back, but heck it tasted authentic to me!  

The decor was cute inside, it reminded me of My Big Fat Greek Wedding!

So although its Greek, don't expect an \"OOPPPAAAH\" rather an \"HOLAAAA!\" 

Happy Eating!
-Gen"}
{"text":"I took my family here and was very disappointed. It is a definite tourist attraction, and not for locals.
Super over priced and the food was terrible.
Save your money and go to one of the big chains. The gyros was the worst I've ever had and the calamari was swimming in grease."}
{"text":"Originally intended to cash in a groupon from one of my childhood favorite pizza chains, i drove all the way to the location just to find a 'We're Sorry! We're Temporary closed due to derpa derpie doo' yeah...great...REALLY wanted a pizza...oh well. On the drive home i debated stopping by a number of places but hell just wasnt in the mood. Just wanted to get food, drive home, consume food, sit on fat ass in front of large 42 inch LCD glowing rectangle. 

Suddenly i remembered the Mad Greek being on the way home. In my mind Greek food is ALWAYS acceptable.

First impression was...wow wtf is up with that dry erase board...I really didnt want to look like a clueless moron sitting in my car blocking the drive through menu so i just drove up. Good thing for me the drive through service was a little slow so i had time to score a few quick glances at the menu. Ended up going with a Mad Gyro with fries combo.

The wait was pretty long due to the fries being made to order. I could understand that and Greek food isnt exactly known for being super super made to order fast while being good at the same time. Few minute later had my plastic bag with togo box and was on my way.

First impression was...WOW the size is pretty impressive. Gyro seems to be overflowing with meat and they didnt skimp on the fries. Second impression...damn it i wanted some hummus for my fries...

After taking a bite of the gyro meat i do concur with the other reviews that mention the food being a bit on the salty side. it WAS a bit on the salty side but once paired up with the various chunky cuts of various veggies (and fruit, tomato is a fruit after all) and the yogurt sauce it balanced out quite nicely.

A bit on the pricey side but then again this isnt your average burgers and fries kinda place...even though they are structured as such...and there are burgers and fries on the menu."}
{"text":"Been to Greece, that's how the food tastes like. Décor is slightly tacky but food is really good. Great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Decent falafel, but the sphere-shaped balls were overcooked and the tahini sauce needed some more sesame flavor because it tasted like something that holds bricks together. I think falafel is usually served with the other sauce - Tzitiachi or whatever they call it.  Excellent rice pilaf for $2 extra, instead of fries and huge sandwich for 7 bucks. Drive through audio needs work as girl couldn't understand my menu question. Drive through for a greek joint is a good thing though."}
{"text":"Please get courteous waitresses!  We dine there all the time in the evenings & those waitresses are kind & appear to be of Greek Nationality. Today we made the mistake & had lunch.  The waitress was Mexican & RUDE!  We no more sat down & she was on us to order NOW!  What's the rush?!?!?Make a change or you won't get our $$ any more, dinner or lunch!  We are the customers. WE MATTER!"}
{"text":"$10 for a gyro sounds a little steep but when you consider it's massive size, along with the mountain of fries it's served with, AND the simple side salad you get, it's a good value.

Giant, pillowy pita is packed with tons of fresh beef and lamb (NY/Chicago style), along with tomato and onions- tzatziki is packed separately to add on yourself. Fries were a bit soggy but well seasoned and flavorful, saved my salad for later.

Service was friendly, surprised to find a bar inside this casual-sounding eatery. The dark interior and chandeliers were an odd decorative choice, but the gyros are definitely good here despite a massive menu of more diverse and complicated options. Sometimes simple is best- in terms of ordering and décor. Open the windows and let some light in here!"}
{"text":"Meh, this was a disappointment. This is a full service, sit down Mad Greek location (unlike the one in Primm). Thus, the menu has some additional offerings. And it was those additional offerings that brought me here.

It's at the end of a strip mall with a cute patio. Inside is a strange mix between overload of Greek decor, hominess, and just a touch of a dive feel. It looks like the kind of place that might be cool and hopping on a weekend night once it's dark outside and there's live music and dancing happening.

The staff were nice and friendly. But the one reason we came here was a complete letdown. I love love LOVE saganaki. And I have yet to find somewhere in Vegas that offers it. Well, turns out this Mad Greek location (and not the one in Primm) does offer it. Hooray! We eagerly ordered it. And then we waited and waited and waited. It was quite a long wait for saganaki. And when it finally comes out, the waitress is unable to light it on fire. Say what? \"Oh sometimes, it doesn't work.\" She was clearly confused and at first acted like she was going to take it back and fix it or get another one. But nope, she ended up leaving it. Leaving us pondering the question, is it really saganaki if it's not lit on fire? And before we could even begin to eat it, out rolls another order of saganaki for a table that was sat maybe 5 minutes prior. Clearly, our order got lost in the shuffle somehow (and there were only 3 other tables in the place). And, of course, the same waitress is able to light their's on fire. So we proceed to eat our non-fire saganaki. It's blackened on the bottom with no crisp on the sides or top. And it rather lacked any flavor. I didn't even want to eat it after the first couple of bites.

So while there may be some other delicious menu items here. And the ambiance was enjoyable enough. And the staff were friendly. Our visit was a big letdown. A total saganaki fail."}
{"text":"So far , so good! This is the place to eat at when you're trying to sober up,from a night of drinking, LOL, their fries are plain, the gyros are good, nothing special, on the plus, they're open late so we can always get our gyro fix when we crave them, Oh and love that they have drive thru!"}
{"text":"We went to the location at Sahara and Durango in Las Vegas.  I agree with some of the others.  The food was overpriced and could have been better.  My theory is that they are trying to improve flavor with salt, (like in the stuffed grape leaves) and sugar, (the strawberry shake.)  If they want to charge higher prices, they need to improve the flavor with a balance of ingredients, and the sugar or salt shouldn't dominate. Most people can see through over salting and over sweetening.  Also the chicken gryo on the salad was overcooked and greasy.  It was almost woody.  The Greek salad was good, but you can get those anywhere these days.  The albondigas soup was also very good, but for those prices you expect everything to be memorable and top notch.  Five dollars for a pot of tea sort of makes you feel like a sucker. 

The music was loud, and the decor was fun.  it would be a nice place to go to celebrate a special occasion if you could get your money's worth.

We were there at 9:00 at night.  Perhaps the food and service is better on another shift.  Still. . ."}
{"text":"I had been craving a gyro and spanokopita sooooo badly.

Phoned in my order, waited 15 mins at the bar with no one coming by to ask me if i needed anything. I was right in the middle, with two empty chairs on either side of me.

WTF? I just think they were racists.....maybe not, but i'm gonna call it that.

I called to complain once i got outside to leave, the guy tells me \"why didn't you get someones attention?\". Hmmm, WTF do you think i was trying to do you racist?"}
{"text":"Pretty Great Greek food... The salads are very tasty and of course the gyros are yummy.  We used to love it here when they danced and threw the plates but these days it is more sedate.   If you are playing video poker, they do not give you any drink free - only bar brands... You can sit and wait for carry out but beware the video poker machines were not very friendly or loose when I was there:("}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever... Me and my best friend never got our orders taken, but everyone who got to the restaurant after us did... We left. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim for dinner one night and had an overall pleasant experience.  The restaurant is very large and has incredibly ornate decorations from all over Europe.  We were seated by a friendly man who took our drink order and brought them out to us shortly after.  Then... we sat for about 15 minutes before our server came over to take our order.  To start, we decided on the zucchini sticks.  I ordered the chicken gyro and my fiance ordered the beef and lamb gyro.  There was some more waiting and our zucchini finally came out.  These were delicious with the ranch dipping sauce.  Our server asked if we would like some spicy sauce too and my fiance said yes.  She never came back with it and we had finished the appetizer and decided that it was no big deal.

When our entrees arrived, mine looked unexpectedly...brown, for chicken.  I asked if it was chicken and our server said something along the lines of how she thought I had also ordered the beef and lamb.  Luckily, she brought over the correct gyro 5 minutes later.  I loved the fries, which look like little chips and the cucumber spread for the gyro was absolutely delicious.

Overall,the service was very slow that night when they were not busy.  The food and friendliness of everyone there was great, so we will return again to try out some more of their selections on the menu in the near future."}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend and I's first day in Vegas and we just happened to find a buy one get one free coupon along the strip at one of the newspaper dispensers. Well it was getting late and we were hungry so since it was on the way back to our hotel we took a chance and tried it. Now I know what Greek food should taste like because I am Greek and have grown up eating good authentic Greek food since I was born.

If your looking for good authentic Greek food this is the place. The food was AMAZING and reminded me of the Greek food I had in Greece. It was WONDERFUL! My boyfriend had the souvlaki plate and he loved it. He especially enjoyed the cucumber sauce and the portion size. It was huge! I had the Gyro Plate and that was fabulous as well! Huge huge portions. 

Trust me the place is totally worth it and the price can't be beat. If you can get a coupon do it because you will be wanting to take more home. It's truly worth it. Truly worth it!"}
{"text":"CLOSED for renovation!!! On a few occasions I have called to order carry out and no answer. Yesterday I decided they are a restaurant who doesn't answer the phone when busy and I drove there to order their gyros.... The are closed!!! Looks like for renovations. Dudes, invest in an answering machine to let people know. Nothing like driving 10 miles to be disappointed. I ended up going to another Greek restaurant about a mile away that was amazing!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped to have lunch. The gyro was delicious!  The lunch special was reasonable. For $9, you got a salad, gyro, and rice or fries. The fries were fresh and tasted like Greek potatoes. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the decor is fun, but I'm not sure that makes up for where The Mad Greek falls short. 

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. 

The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. 

I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. 

When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.

Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch."}
{"text":"Good filet of sole skewers. Gyros meat is only good...not great. Might be a good place for large groups. Very good cheese puffs."}
{"text":"The only way these people get two stars is because I liked the food. Well I loved the food. But anyways. The service was horrible. Wasn't busy at all and our server only had two tables to wait on. She either didn't like her job or she didn't like us. Wouldn't even fill up our sodas. And she was just standing there. Will never go back but I hear they have a take out place on Rainbow. I plan on going there to get some food without having to talk to their servers."}
{"text":"Well, it is  fast food greek food, not gourmet, people ! It's not the fastest; they do cook it all right when you order it... at least what I  order

Best BLT in town. Awesome hummus. I don't like lamb but I do love their lambchops!

My only 2 gripes are the pitas are pre-packaged and in obvious view and the makeshift menu in the drive through that is broke 1/3 of the time. And the employees could be a touch more happy.  Not sure what it is, but I don't think I'd ever want to actually eat in, but it's not stopping me from the drive through.

I'd recommend adding a drink the the meal deals. Because, although it's greek food, $10-15 a meal justifies only a couple of visits per week versus daily.

Good luck Mad Greek"}
{"text":"We came to the Sunday brunch for $20, service was great very family oriented place  my favorites were the gyro ,  chicken parmesan,  the ribs,  and the grape leaves stuffed ,  baklava was ok  we woukd definitely come back again  good  place to eat and try everything,  they also had a made to order omelet bar"}
{"text":"Ok so at first I would say it's a little over-priced but then after today I guess I can see why you pay $12 for a Gyro Salad.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The dressing was TO DIE FOR which makes me wonder if their greek fries are yummy too?  The Tzatziki  sauce, while a little too much dill (for my taste) was creamy and had pieces of fresh cucumbers in it.  Salad - fresh romaine, tomatoes (fresh), green peppers, cilantro (fresh), olives - YUM.  The lamb was tender and tasty and so was the pita bread that accompanied the salad.  On a previous occasion I had ordered the Gyro lunch which wasn't quite as good.  Fries were kind of cold.  I've never been inside so can't comment on the dining area/staff.  I would go back for that yummy Gyro Salad in a heart beat though!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, but the food was so so.  Not sure I'll be back as there are others in town that offer better quality with a lower price.
Might return for an outdoor wine/apps night with the gals."}
{"text":"AMAZING LIFE SAVER...

After heading out of Vegas back to the Bay area after a crazy weekend in LV for EDC , we were stuck in traffic and very hungry . We stopped to get gas off the freeway and I instantly panicked when I saw there were no healthy options in sight. I dont care for fast food it always makes my stomach hurt. Plus it was 100 degrees outside and we were in the middle of the desert. I was worrying about the nasty food I was about to be forced to consume .. and then boom this place pops up . I was so happy ! made the bf pull in so quick I think the car made a screeching sound (ok im exaggerating) ..

so the food.. I had the Gyro and fries. Fresh delicious Gyro meat and the fries were perfect and not greasy at all... 
My bf had the same and some deep fried somethings that were tasty. This place is really good and I cant wait to come back and have some more !"}
{"text":"Tasty Gyro hell yeah !!

we were waiting for the bus to take us back downtown, and the bus went by like twice because they were full, and I was hungry as hell, and the Mad Greek is right behind the bus stop, so I got a Gyro with no Tomatoes, the pepperchini on it added a nice little taste to it.

I would to go back and try some other stuff"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. They don't offer a lunch menu anymore, just a regular menu. Service not that great.
Ordered a greek platter, octopus, chese stuffed egplant and desserts. The platter was alright, the meats were tasty, tzatziki was good. Octopus was great, however, the eggplant that comes with it for some reason was not brought together with the octopus, but 10min later. Cheese stuffed eggplant was yummy.
As for the desserts, the tiramisu tasted good, but it was not a classical tiramisu im my understanding. The cheese stuffed pastry tasted yummy, I just wish they would have mentioned on the menu that there is cinnamon,  as I can't stand it."}
{"text":"This place was understaffed, food overcooked and greasy, the lettuce and tomatoes that was served in our gyros were half rotten.  The service there was non-existant unless you were Greek.  I always went through the Mad Greek in Baker, CA and love the food, but this place is sooooooo not like the one in Baker.  We were going to go to Paymons, but this was on the way there so we stopped here instead since we've been to the other one.  Big Mistake....  Not going to make that one twice."}
{"text":"For lunchtime, Mad Greek is the bomb. I'm very fond of their gyro which is a large, meat-laden pita baby. I get it served with piping-hot fries and a small side salad. The broiled octopus (oktapodaki) is a must try. I've never tasted a more tender octopus. They offer complimentary pita while you wait for your meal. The pita is warm, yummy and has a nice soft texture. 

The waitresses are sweet and friendly and I'm a bit surprised that this place doesn't attract a larger lunch crowd. I'm guessing that this place doesn't turn around food quickly enough for the regular 1-hour lunch customer. The Mad Greek's kitschy decor may be over the top for some people but I find it interesting. I have to admit that if I look at it for a long time, it pains my aesthetics. 

Some of the prices on their entrees are steeper than expected, especially the seafood. I haven't had a chance to explore other items on their menu but I hope the increased price equates to fresher ingredients and food made to order."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 01/01 & was surprised they deliver to north las vegas, but they did.
Food was delivered hot, quick and was very good!"}
{"text":"Most of the food we ordered was very good. We particularly liked the octopus appetizer. The gyros are great. Wonderful  tzaziki sauce. Sometimes though they would mess up the order. Last time I ordered stuffed cabage leaves and they brought me the stuffed  grape leaves,but they were really good as well,so I didn't complain. The atmosphere  reminds me of Eastern  Europe, so I took the good and the bad and had an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Do not order out they will mess it up everytime!! I thought the first time they messed up the order it would not happen again!! It's 2 hours later and they brought us two wrong orders and we had to cancel the entire order!! Terrible customer service and on top of everything they were rude about the entire process!! We cannot support an incompetent establishment with poor customer service!! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"The Mad Greek in Baker, CA has been a staple of my families many road trips back and forth to Southern CA. We would either stop on the way from Vegas or on our way back to Vegas. 

Naturally we had to check this restaurant out since it had the same name and the same infamous fresh strawberry shake. In the past year that we have discovered this place we have been here numerous times for dinner, cocktails and their wonderful happy hour. 

Between their fair pricing on their food, their personable staff and their knack for accommodating children, I have to say that I have grown to really love this place. Happy Hour is my favorite time to go, its for a couple of hours between 4pm - 6pm and offers great HH prices on drinks (beer, wine and mixed drinks) and has a pretty good tapas-esque HH menu. I was here recently for happy hour with my 2 year old son and my girlfriend. Neither of us had any cocktails but we ordered quite a bit from the tapas menu. I always start with a HH sized Greek salad, its my favorite, so full of flavor including olives and tons of feta. I order the Greek fries with feta for my son who loves french fries (these are more like home-style fries,) and the spanikopita (spinach and cheese filled phyllo dough.) My friend ordered the coconut shrimp, a small Greek salad and the goat cheese flambe (which was not en flambe lol.) We shared everything we had and it was ALL so yummy!  We were all full and the bill came out to be about $30 or so. You really cannot beat that price for all the food we got. 

One of the other reasons I like coming to the Mad Greek is how kid-friendly they are. Every time we are there the employees light up when they see my son and my son equally lights up when he sees the Mad Greek sign. After every meal they always ask if its ok to give him an ice cream sundae and always check to make sure he is a happy camper. The Greek has a dance floor with a stage for the times they do live music (which is GREAT!) and my son loves to get on that dance floor and show his moves off - they all love it. 

Make sure to sit outside when the weather is a bit warmer, the patio is (as other reviewers have stated) in a parking lot but it is closed off and has a great ambiance, especially at night with the heat lamps and the fire pit. The Mad Greek is often on Restaurants.com and getting a certificate is a great way for a first timer to try out the restaurant. OPA!!"}
{"text":"Second bad experience with service. We went for lunch around 1:00 or so. Felt very rushed from the time we were seated until the time we got up. When our server walked up to our table, all she said was \"You ready?\" We'd just sat down, so we quickly put in our drink order and told her we needed a few minutes. She came back right away while we were still looking over our menus and said it again, \"You ready?\" If we would have gotten the server that was waiting on the table next to us, it would have been a very nice overall experience. She was helpful with the menu, gave menu options, pleasantly took special requests and didn't rush the patrons whatsoever. We got the opposite. Not helpful with the menu at all and made us feel like we needed to hurry. Everything came out together. Including our side salads. Since it had been a while for our food to come out, I figured she'd at least ask if we wanted her to bring out the hummus or side salads before our meal. I would have overlooked that but overall she was rude. At the end of our quick lunch, she stood there staring at my plates, basically rushing me, when I was putting my unfinished food in my take home box. She should have come back for the plates when I was done or offered to plate it for me if she was in such a hurry to take the plates away. I wasn't being slow. She also saw that we needed more than one take home box but didn't seem to care that I was putting it all together in one box. So since she was just standing there staring, I took that as an opportunity to ask her for another box. She came back and still just stood there waiting for my plate. As far as \"you ready\" and not asking what choices we wanted as our sides, either she doesn't speak English very well or just didn't care to take the time, or both. She was also wiping and blowing her nose behind the bar without washing her hands. I watched her just walk off after she threw her wadded up tissue in the trash. She was just plain rude. Maybe we'll see if we can request our server the next time we go. 

Our food was great. Piping hot and fresh. Ordered from the lunch menu. Hubs enjoyed the beef and lamb gyro. I had the hummus and pita (I went easy on the pita. It was hard not to eat more than I did) and I also had the stuffed grape leaves. If I wasn't watching my waist line I would have welcomed on the numerous warm soft pita strips. From what I've read on Yelp, they continue to fill the basket. They're soo good but I still went easy. Same with the generous amount of creamy sauce topped with capers that came on the grape leaves. I enjoyed some of it but mostly ate around it. Next time, I'll ask for sauce on the side or just easy on the sauce. The rice was perfect. The side salad was nice. It was all very good. Since it was lunch and I'm going easy with my portions, I ate a small amount of everything. Therefore, I had an entire meal to take home. They really do give you large portions. Ladies, if you're you're eating light and are going there with your girlfriends, it would be easy to order hummus and split an entree and be completely satisfied. The bar looks nice too."}
{"text":"we went here a few times,  it was just OK,  then the last time the meat in the gyro was so over cooked I couldn't eat it,  never going back,  how hard is it to make a fukin gyro?"}
{"text":"Lots and Lots of options on their menu.
They've got good space for groups but be sure to make reservations.

I always have a hard time figuring out what to eat because for the most part it's all pretty good.
The greek gyro salad is always a good choice.... it's a meal in itself and comes with pita bread.  I sometimes get a side of rice... I really like their rice... but then I like all rice so ... that's just me.

Fun place to go with friends so bring a few and hang out and eat your way through the menu.  Definitely suggest ordering a handful of appetizers and some wine and hanging out.  

It's a casual, laid back place so take a load off and enjoy some quality time with friends.  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim...this will be our \"Go To\" place for Greek.  Zaziki was incredible and the Gyros were Awesome!  The portions are very generous, the selection fantastic and the atmosphere is everything you like about a slightly over the top Greek Restaurant.  Bring your appetite!

Our server was very fun and informative, making it an overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here last night. I was extremely sick after eating it, stomach cramps and nausea for some reason I thought it was because we ate so late and I'm not used to eating late. So today I ate the last 2 pieces of pita bread and cucumber sauce and hummus as a little snack and my stomach is back to being in knots and I'm nauseous. Will never get food from here again."}
{"text":"Opa! My first visit to the Mad Greek in Vegas was a great one.

Visited this past Friday night and my first impression was \"very clean\".  We arrived around 8pm to a live band that was playing traditional Greek music and when we were seated -  we were advised that we'd see some belly dancing, too.

We had planned on just a bite to eat but made it a night out.

We ordered the sampler platter which was $22 a person.  It included a first course of plates like hummus, babaganoush, eggplant salad, feta and olives, pita and more .... The 2nd course included shish kabobs, mousaka, pasistio, dolmades, roasted chicken, spanikopita, rice and I can't remember what else.  Overall - it was a great value and we went home with plenty of left overs.

For dessert - we order the galaktoboureko which is one of my favorite desserts.

Everything was great, the service was great.  We never felt rushed ....

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The name \"Mad Greek\" conjures up memories of roadies to SoCal and those many pit stops in Baker to buy lottery tickets. I only stopped at the Baker location once to get a gyro and thought it to be pretty decent so when The Mad Greek opened on Rainbow my wife (she's a SoCal) and I wanted to check it out. The reviews are mixed! 

  I ordered a gyro burger which had to be one of the most insanely delicious burgers I've ever had. The gyro burger is a fat burger patty topped with a serious portion of gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes and Tzatziki sauce. The bun cradled the burger nicely and the sandwich was \"drip down your arms\" juicy. It was almost too big. My wife ordered a gyro and was slightly less impressed with her meal than I was with mine. The pita seemed to be slightly stale, there was very little feta and not much Tzatziki sauce. She also ordered a caramel shake which was pretty decent but still a little underwhelming. 

  I would certainly go back to The Mad Greek for one of their burgers, but if you're looking for a great gyro you need to go around the corner to Yassou's. They still have the best gyro in town."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a bite on the way to Vegas and I must say, the service here is absolutely horrible! The cashier who took my order looked like he hated his job. He had a blank expression on his face the entire time and even yawned while taking my order. He also got my order wrong and when I corrected him, he rolled his eyes at me! He did apologize after I gave him a death glare but still, rude! 

As for the food, I had the chicken gyro and it was actually pretty good. A little on the pricey side but it's better than eating at one of the nearby fast food joints."}
{"text":"Don't order out. They screw it up every time. 
Last night ordered  two gyros. One chicken and rice,the other lamb with fries. 

Got lamb with rice and pork with rice.
Was brought out to me bagged and tied up. Should have checked but still crappy when I got home  with the wrong orderl.  Good Job screwing them both up. 


Quality of food is good though."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice just because I love the look of the place. 

Both times the staff has been friendly and the service adequate.

My complaint here is the food. I just don't find it appealing. Now it could just be me. I've never had Greek food before. So perhaps I just don't like it.

I'd probably go here again for a drink as I do like the place. it's fun and different.

If I was to eat here again I'd try to find something more American that I'm use to."}
{"text":"Not just NO but NEVER AGAIN
First, we arrived excited for Greek.. It was Latino Night.. \WTF ??  Our choice Quit and Outside with a lot of Cigarette smoke, or inside.. we chose inside.
The Band was Loud, and took forever to noisily set up. While we were enduring this banging and clanging of noise ( around 9pm )  we were seated  ( in the VIP section ) then ignored.. no drinks,  etc. Finally we had to find a server to get service. We ordered two of the flaming saganaki.. they took forever,  and then dumped  on the table.. one barely   aflame, the other.. nothing, dada, zip. This is usually a fun highlight of greek dinners.. the brought out  replacements after a long wait.. then dinner arrived and they failed to serve on of our guests.
Overall, a poor experience, we will NEVER go back... we have always had a great experience at OPA.. ( on Rainbow ) and we will go there instead..

If you  want a noisy Latino Salsa Greek Rude Experience with BAD food.. ( the Ouzo was good though..) then this is your place.
I have been here when they first opened under different management and a different name it was great.. the new ownership has expanded the place and ruined it.

The food..
Ouzo Good
Saganaki, Horrid
Lamb Shank.. actually good, but with the experience, I didnt finish the dinner.. ruined.


So where to go for Greek...

Gyro Salad.. Winchells Pub on Warm Spring
Greek Food and Entertainment, OPA

People you dont like, send them here"}
{"text":"It's official. I am on a quest for the best gyro in town!

I've been to the Mad Greek a few times this summer and I am glad I did.  Before then over a year ago I was at this location and we had some bad experiences.  The server got our order wrong and then proceeded to lie to my wife that it WAS what she ordered when it in fact wasn't.  They couldn't keep their story straight and someone else acknowledged that it was wrong and gave it to us on the house and ordered the right thing for her.  After that experience we stayed away for a while.

I'm all for giving it another try after time has passed and I'm glad we did.

The first time in a while that we went, it was on a Wednesday and it was kind of late.  We sat outside  and it was pretty dark.  The blue lights they usually had on wasn't on.  No matter - we were there for the food!

I ordered the Gyro Plate which had beef & lamb with tzatziki sauce, an unlimited supply of pitas and for dessert we shared a \"bomba\" which is like two hard-shelled scoops of ice cream.   It was very good!

The last time I was here was very fun! They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am not going to lie. The live music was SO CHEESY!  So cheesy in fact, that I thought I was in a Napoleon Dynamite movie.  But because the music was like that, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  Seriously! I had a great time.

We sat outside again and they had the blue lights on this time.  Only bad thing was that the table we sat at didn't have a burning candle. :P

Our server was very attentive and we got our orders taken quickly and our food as well.

For an appetizer I ordered the dolmades and it was exquisite.  For the main course I ordered the Onassis Burger.  Delicious!  It was like a large cheeseburger topped with pastrami.  We also had free pita bread that we ate with the sauce from the dolmades. 

My wife ordered the greek salad (the big one) and it was HUGE!  Next time we come, she said she would order the smaller one.  The waitress girl asked her the question earlier \"are you sure you want the bigger one?\"  Now we know why she did.

And to top off the meal we each had our own order of bomba.  It was $5 each, but oh-so-worth-it.   I loved everything about that night. I had a great time and the food was great.

Our waitress was great.

The only negative thing is that sitting out side is kind of ghetto.  All the cars driving by the smiths, the pedestrian traffic, the crazy drivers and neighborhood idiots sure know how to make themselves known.  Next time we come, we are going to be sitting inside for sure."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  I have been looking for a good gyro here that could compare to my favorite gyro hangout I had when I lived in Tampa. I had the NY style gyro (which is lamb and beef mix) with fries. The gyro had very tender and well flavored meat. It was a large gyro. I hear people complain about the price but for the portions that they give you I thought it was very reasonable, especially if you compare it to gyro times where the price is the same and the gyro is way smaller. The only suggestion I have is ease up on the dill in the Tzatziki. It was a little over powering. Good food, good service and clean restaurant. I got the strawberry shake also it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for a quick after work late lunch. My coworker had a 20 percent off coupon. I ordered a gyro sandwich and instead of rice or fries I wanted a salad .  I was charged $7 for a side salad substitution.  Annoying!  Along with a bottle of water my bill with the coupon was $13!  A bit pricey for lunch.  Food was too salty. Didn't finish most of it. I asked for a sprite on way out. As I was driving my sprite leaked. Cheap cups, my beverage seeped through. Go to mad Greek on Sahara and durango if u wanna go to a mad Greek. They have happy hour from 11 to 7 and their patio is great !"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place!  The atmosphere was a bit gaudy, yes but our waitress was cute as a button and extremely polite.  We came after Happy Hour, but she showed us menus for happy hour and told us about the blues/jazz and belly dancers for future.  

We ordered humms, large greek salad and shrimp souvlaki.  Honestly, everything was fantastic.  Our pita was warm.  Our waitress was very attentive.  We ordered 2 lemonades that came in long, super tall glasses. It seemed fresh squeezed.  We did go a little late, there were about 4 other tables outside and they had the fire pit going.  We wil be back."}
{"text":"went by for a meal...friday, sept.18th....closed/lost their lease...."}
{"text":"Spent some time looking for this place. It's closed and has been replaced by Taco Gorda."}
{"text":"Great experience! The beef and lamb gyro is delicious. The flavor of the meat is one of the best gyros I've had. The portions are large.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  They even have free wifi. This is a great spot for lunch or dinner. It's a must try for Greek food fans."}
{"text":"WOW..hard to believe some of these reviews.....my husband and I drove across town to have lunch here today.....the Greek food was the best!  The gyros were so full of meat and flavor....we have leftovers and the dolmathes with avalemmano sauce were even better than my mother in laws.....  the service was great ...and the restaurant is really nice...and clean...  anyone who expects \"fast \" service in a greek restaurant.....should stick with the drive thru in Primm...."}
{"text":"I am really getting tired of restaurants that specialize in a specific region of the world, yet do such a poor job a reflecting the culinary offerings of that region.

I must confess, I am not an expert on Greek cuisine, but I feel I have had better Greek than this. 

I can tell the difference between fresh ingredients and something that has sat in the walk-in cooler for a couple of weeks. 

This is Las Vegas, a restaurant can not afford to get lazy about quality or it will end up being another victim of the recession."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Drove by it for over 5 years and finally decided to try it.   Great food!   Great service!  Nice atmosphere!   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I am saddened that this restaurant has closed this was I was just looking through Yelp and saw this news. I wanted to go down there this week. 

I can't think of any place else that one after the original is better than the original. It was very clean the sit down service was nice, the staff was attentive and the food was spot on. We had the calamari, gyros and all were fresh flavorful and good."}
{"text":"I tried the Mad Greek again after telling myself two years ago, I'd never go back there again.  The food lived down to my expectations once again.  I picked up take out for the family.  I ordered Mousaka, Spanakopita, Dalmades, Gyro Platter, Tarmosalada, and a seaweed salad. (pardon the spellings).  The Mousaka was the best of the plates and I'd rate it as barely average, but at least it was hot which was better than the last time I ate in the restaurant.  The Spanadopita was soggy with an unpleasant aftertaste, the Dalmades were way too salty and uneatable, The Gyro Platter was good but lacking on the meat, the Tarmosalada was fairly tastless and reminded me more like mayo, and the seaweed salad was actually quite tasty.  There are too many far better Greek restaurants to enjoy.  My recommendation is to try another."}
{"text":"The Mad Greek cafe is one of my favorite restaurants. Have been eating there for the last one year on a regular basis. They have the best gyros and the best lamb shank in town. Bacon cheese burger is on top of my list as well. 
Food comes up really fast no matter how busy they are.
I would recommend it to anyone! Thank you very much Mad Greek cafe!!! You guys are the best!!"}
{"text":"Man I'm from Chicago & I been living in Vegas 1 year, for this whole year I have been looking for a GREAT gyro like at home and I have finally found it, here!!! My boyfriend had a double gyro cheeseburger. The salad & fries was fresh & good as well!! Great food! We will be going back in a few days to try other things on the menu. It's a nice lil spot to come for a date or ladies out."}
{"text":"Love this place!   You can't go wrong with their Gyro!   I recommend highly!  Happy they have this location as I used to always stop at the one in Baker while on the way to Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were undercooked and we didn't notice until the kids were almost done with their meal.  After dinner our family talked for about 15 minutes and the right before we left the restaurant our son got a terrible stomach ache a threw up all the wings by the front door.  Our hamburgers were terrible and the kids got sick from the chicken fingers.  We will never go back.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Greek restaurant that wasn't outrageously expensive.  I was very happy with The Mad Greek.  The only issues I had was my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to be acknowledged when we walked in and the tziki sauce was a little watery than I like.  But other than that, the food we had was wonderful, our server was such a sweetheart, and the price was okay.  I'd be happier if it was a little cheaper, but it was nonetheless a fun and enjoyable environment.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would expect this location to go the route of the other two vegas locations in the next 6 months.  came on Saturday night at dinner time and the place was empty.  the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either.  I had the gyro platter.  pita and hummas were good.  meat was ok.  my dining companion had a chicken skewer.  the chicken was moist but it lacked flavor.  the greek beer was good.  service was fine but it took 30 mins to get our check."}
{"text":"First time here and we definitely like it much better than Paymon's. The ambiance is really nice, a bit too dim to read the menu though. It wasn't crowded, so that was a good thing to us. We had spanakopita (which was really good!) and we ordered chicken gyro with lemon potatoes and the Greek platter (which has spanakopita, chicken kebabs, rice, chicken, stuffed grape leaves, lasagna and musaka, however you spell it). My husband has a slice of baklava and loved it!! Will definitely return to this place!"}
{"text":"Mediocre management. We Made an online order and decided to change it so we called and they said they would cancel it with no problem. \"Re-ordered online with the changes we wanted. Guess what? 

They delivered BOTH orders, charged my card and had no recollection of us calling to cancel/change/correct out online. 

Good food, good quality. Shotty customer service. Shitty attitude. 

Keep my $160 bucks folks- last dollar you make from us."}
{"text":"The perfect non-fast food place to have lunch on our drive home from Vegas. The gyro meat was yummy and not too salty. I absolutely loved the tzatziki sauce which had chunks of cucumbers and pickles in it.  The side of rice that came with it was also good."}
{"text":"Ran into one of the managers at a bar last month and he was handing out free gyro gift cards. Two of us finally made it over and very happy we did. The gyros were huge, beef and lamb with onions and tomatoes. Also got fried mushrooms and hummus with pita bread. Both were very good, and I really wished I could have finished the hummus but I was so stuffed from the gyro it was not possible! Their happy hour pricing is pretty amazing, and I will definitely go back to try more things. The service was a lil slow, but to be fair they were prepping for a party of 150!"}
{"text":"I feel so let down... Heard the Happy Hour was back on. Got a great seat on the patio near one of the fountains. Now in the daylight, the patio decor may seem somewhat gaudy but it is shady and comfy.  At night it is a lot prettier.  It could be the perfect place to hang out.

Unfortunately the food & drinks leave so much to be desired and I so wanted to fall back in love with The Mad Greek since changing from The Golden Greek.

We ordered the Saganaki.  The cheese did not have the same taste as before and although the server lit it on fire in front of us, it was still hard in the middle. The hummus and pita were good. The fried zucchini and greek fries were good when hot-we got them barely warm and the tzatziki sauce was average.  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail, goat cheese flambe and a phyllo pastry with cheese insde were good.

The service was slow as far as the food was concerned but the servers themselves were attentive.  Given their attentiveness the rate of food coming from the kitchen must have been due to the kitchen and not a fault of the servers.  Our first server was new and was quick to tell us when she was unable to answer our questions BUT she went to go find out! How rare is that these days?

We started off with pomegranite martinis.  Yuck.  All I tasted was vodka and it was not worth $8.00.  Same for the mango mojito.  Too sweet-did not even finish.  My husband ordered cheesecake and my friend ordered the tiramisu.  They agreed that the desserts were average & most likely not homemade-nothing that a cheaper Sara Lee could not satisfy.

I will have to hear about HUGE changes before coming back and I am so hoping that The Mad Greek will succeed."}
{"text":"I love the food. Me and my husband tried 3 times already for lunch , all the time we had great service and good food !! But last time we wait 10 min to pay our bill coz our sever was busy to do pick up order . Meat Combinations are good for 2 pl. I think it was around $27 ! Good price for lunch !! Next time we wanna try buffet $20 each"}
{"text":"We ate here on Thursday, 8/14.  I haven't been here in a while but I thought I'd give it another try.  I've been to the one in Baker many times & always have a good experience.  This Mad Greek is a restaurant.  The menu has changed since my last visit.  Now instead of just offering a gyro & chicken gyro there are 3 or 4 other versions.  This was very confusing.  We asked the waitress who was no help whatsoever.  The food was pretty good but the service is terrible.  There were 2 waitresses working, which was fine since they weren't busy.  They were slow to come to the table, they never checked up on us, we also have a really hard time when we wanted the check & to pay."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I even would consider returning one day. But not anytime soon. While the food there is good, the menu extensive and the prices generally cheap-to-fair, I've got a problem with their service. I was forewarned by a colleague that the waitstaff is known for being super-slow, no matter how busy the place gets. But I wanted to try it nonetheless, so a friend and I went after the lunch rush. Mercifully, the speed of delivery and service wasn't an issue. But our server made awkward missteps nonetheless. She brought out a beer when one wasn't ordered. She looked at me funny when I asked her to either sub out or, if not an option, witthold the vegetables included with my entree. (\"Our chef doesn't like to do that,\" she said, STILL bringing out the veggies. Where some restaurants' menus make it clear they don't do substitutions, Mad Greek's does not.) And then she included the beer on the bill, which meant she had to go back and amend it, though it wasn't without a passive-aggressive complaint to infer she was being inconvenienced. I enjoyed the food, but the server pretty much ruined the overall experience. Until I know the service improves, I'll be visiting other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants."}
{"text":"I tried this Mad Greek location for the first time today. I ordered the Mad Gyro Combo with rice. The gyro was good. Full of meat. The salad underneath was a little store bought but refreshing nonetheless. The tzatziki was great. Loaded with dill and chunks of cucumber. The pita was kind of dry and even a little bit crunchy in places. The rice was simple but good. I think it was cooked with chicken broth. The best part of my experience was when they brought me a free sample of their fried zuchini sticks. Delicious. Between the good and the bad, the Greek was okay in my book."}
{"text":"I love stopping at the Mad Greek in Baker so I had to try this one.  I went there on a Friday night and I was surprised at how small of a place it is.  It sits right in the corner of a little strip mall looking place next to the strip.  I was perplexed by the menu so I asked the kid at the register and sure enough they have NO SHWARMA!  I get that every time I go to the classic Baker restaurant.  I went ahead and got the Mad Gyro which I was told is beef and lamb (not unlike shwarma).  I got it with no onion, peppers or tomatoes.  It was excellent.  The cucumber salad thing that always comes on the side was, as always, delicious.  Rice was perfect.  I will definitely go back there again.  I can highly recommend the Mad Gyro."}
{"text":"Slow kitchen, slow staff..But who really cares..when you can sit outside and enjoy the most delicious Greek food in Vegas. I love this place. So good."}
{"text":"A perfect place to stop after the insomniac nights in Vegas!!We left to Los Angeles leaving behind the Flashing lights and all the sins we committed :D
And we did come across the board US Best Gyro..so we did get down and i must say it was 108 F that day!ouch.We ordered the Gyros and ahmmm we were definitely hungry ,and it was kind of satisfying but not the BEST Gyro ..awwww..But they had some good greek cafe and their Strawberry milkshake was fatty good .This is a good diner place.And it doesn't hurt to stop by and get some satisfying Gyros than the usual fries and greasy burgers.But my friend had her eye on the range of sweets of they had.Maybe i would go back with her to check them out,i shall save that for my next Vegas trip.So mark it down people!MAD GREEK on your way back from VEGAS.The name actually makes sense.After Vegas+this place=MAD GREEK!get it uh uh? :D

{"text":"Loved this place when we ate there over a year ago. Drove by just to see if it was true that they were closed.....it is! Gave one star rating because we are disappointed they are closed. Sign said \"lost our lease, Thank You\", with no new location given. So one star given for the closing of a four star restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not the best Greek I've had.....but good nonetheless....^_^

The Gyros are pretty good I have to say....large serving.....plus the meat was crisp and tender....

I always saw this place driving up to Vegas and I wanted to try it....then seeing it on Diner's Drive Ins and Dives just made me want to try it even moreso hah....

Thankfully I got to coerce my Family to come with.....definitely worth trying if you need to get your Greek Fix satisfied....

Everything is very over the top in decor.....but you gotta love it.....good strawberry shake too!!!

OPA!"}
{"text":"Back at Mad Greek tonight. Food was awesome. Never better service anywhere."}
{"text":"I love their food.  The grilled octopus and escargot are my absolute favorite.   I've been 4 times and that's all I ever get.  I promise I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat before hitting the strip. It's reasonably priced and has a cool ambiance. You can sit inside or outside. You will need to drive or can it from the strip. The food was tender and well seasoned. The portion sizes are large as well. Service is great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the consistency at Mad Greek has been hit and miss. One time the Gyros sandwich will be fantastic and the next time it will be average at best. We were in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and ordered 4 of the Gyros and side dish combos and 3 of the 4 were great: fresh soft pita, moist gyros meat with maybe a few pieces with crunchy edges mixed in and good sauce. However, I was the one who really wanted a great Gyros and as Murphy's Law would have it, I had the Gyros with a crunchier pita bread and more pieces with crunchier edges on the meat. It was disappointing for me but great for my family.

If they had hit 4 out 4 of the gyros sandwich, I could have given them a 4 rating but being out in Vegas once a year or so it was disappointing for me. We were about 15 minutes away from the restaurant so it wasn't worth it to drive back to get another Gyros especially since I was starving.

Lastly, there was one young lady who kept checking to make sure we had been helped because we were waiting by the door for our take-out order. She invited to sit at a table to wait for our order so kudos to her, we are not sure if all of the waitresses are like her but if they are, expect great service too."}
{"text":"It usually is better.   This time, so-so.   The gyro was missing flavor.   The sauce was so-so.   If you ask me whether I take it or leave it, I can take it, but I can also leave it.  I think reducing the size of the menu and focusing on making a few dishes better would improve the place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is our family tradition to stop here on the way to Vegas.  I couldn't tell you what I got last time because I couldn't pronounce it then when I was reading it off the menu, so I definitely can't remember it now.  It was some kind of chicken shish kabob and it was amazing! Their powdered sugar almond cookies are bomb!! They have a ton of really yummy looking things in their bakery area.  I am looking forward to trying something new next time!"}
{"text":"I remember Mad Greek being featured on Food Network some time ago, but I totally forgot about it on my recent trip to Vegas until my mom brought it up, except with her Chinese accent she pronounced it as \"mah greek.\" Naturally, I was thrilled to finally try this place out. Mad Greek serves other classic favorites such as burgers and pastrami sandwiches besides their famed gyro. Apparently there are several Mad Greek locations all centralized near or around Las Vegas. Here's the dealio:

Have been here twice within a span of two days. I went to the one in Baker as well. The first time to check it out, and since I wasn't hungry enough for a gyro, I got a strawberry milkshake, a pistachio baklava, and a spanakopita to go (yes, definitely wasn't hungry). Here I was expecting to be knocked off my feet and my socks rocked the hell off by the shake ('cause apparently my mom has tried it before and loved it--she rarely likes food). It tasted...not really like a strawberry milkshake. The strawberry flavor was completely off and tasted very bland. Ok, way to mess up a strawberry shake.

The pistachio baklava was all right, but had way too much syrup in one layer, so you ended up with this effect of an imbalanced, overpowering sweetness as you chewed through the pastry. The spanakopita...well I have had much better back in the Bay.

The second time I came back I tried the gyro, and my mom ordered the chicken gyro. The fries were soggy and not crispy. The gyro meat, yogurt sauce and rice were all ridiculously overloaded with salt. Not sure how people could stand that level of sodium on their pallet. I wolfed it down despite the saltiness, my determination to finish it driven only by the price (10 bucks) I paid for it; the gyro was, in fact, a huge disappointment. I love gyros and have tried a number of them, but this one was definitely far off from being the \"Best Gyro in the USA.\" The chicken gyro was actually quite tasty and less salty.

As the juicy cherry on top of my whole experience here, the prices were ridiculously pricey. Almost 5 bucks for a shake; 10 bucks for the gyro and rice or fries, 4 bucks for a fruit cup that didn't even taste fresh or sweet, etc.

Extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place. 

I may return in the future to try out the fried zucchini, but until then Mad Greek you make me sad."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple of times when it was the Golden Greek. I like it a lot better now that it is the Mad Greek. We got here around 8 so we missed happy hour specials, but everything was pretty good and reasonably priced. 

My boyfriend and another friend and I sat outside as it wasn't too terribly hot. Very peaceful setting outside, with a cute fountain in the middle and marbletop tables. Ordered a house Sauvignon Blanc @$7, very crisp and refreshing. 

We shared a large Greek salad, which was enormous and very, very good. Ordered hummus which was served warm and came with warm, soft pita bread. A-MAZING. 

Boyfriend and my friend both ordered the gyro sandwich with greek fries, which they both really liked. I ordered a cup of lentil soup and two tiropitas. The tiropitas were a little bigger than I expected and were full of warm, yummy cheese. Loved it. 

The waitress was so pleasant and prompt, we really liked her. She brought us extra pita bread and refilled our drinks without being asked.

Interior-wise, the place inside is very cheesy decorated but that's OK... the food is great. The menu is a little overwhelming as many have stated, but I was very pleased with my dining experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Greek salad in town.  No one else even comes close.  The salad is perfectly seasoned and packed with tomatoes, olives, and cucumbers.  I am also a fan of their hummus, tzatziki, and baba ghanoush and the fresh pita bread that comes with it.  You can get these items for $4-5 each during their happy hour.  The regular prices are not that much higher.  The pitchers of mojitos are huge, packed with fresh mint, and a great deal during happy hour.

I have a hard time understanding the numerous bad reviews for this restaurant.  I agree that service can sometimes be spotty, but everything I have ever ordered there was delicious and worth the wait.  The past few times I have gone, the place has been practically empty.  This is probably due to bad word of mouth.  If anyone reading these reviews is on the fence about whether or not to try it out, I definitely recommend heading down there for happy hour.  The menu is pretty large, and there might be some items that disappoint.  I have never found another restaurant, though, that can even compete with their salad, hummus, or pita."}
{"text":"Visited The Mad Greek Cafe a couple days ago after the lunchtime rush because I saw the big sign advertising $7.99 lunch specials from the road. I guess I should have known by the fact that there was no one there to turn around but instead I just figured I'd order since I had already walked in. 

I ordered two lunch specials (one of which I was taking to my friend). One was the gyro plate and the other the vegetarian pita sandwich. Each came out about five minutes after I ordered in separate containers. A side of plain rice came with each sandwich and some type of vinegar dressing and the gyro with a yogurt dressing. I picked the vegetarian for my friend and I had the gyro. 

Well, let's say that the gyro was pretty flavorless. Oh, except for the thousands of huge chunks of onions. I ended up pulling out half the thickness of the pita with just raw onions. Total overkill. As for the meat, it was not the fresh meat I was expecting. Kind of dry and very little inside the sandwich. I believe there was a couple tomatoes and perhaps some lettuce. The rice was also flavorless and bland. There was a little pile of lettuce and tomato and more onion for a 'salad' that I didn't quite understand since I thought that some of my sandwich had fallen out but evidently that was a salad. 

My friend wasn't thrilled with his sandwich either. It had feta cheese, avocado and tomato. His reply when I asked how it was ... \"It's okay... too expensive for this though.\"

Overall The Mad Greek Cafe is overpriced for what you are getting. I would expect something this bland and unexciting to cost around $4.50 but here they are charging $7.99. 

I would not ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I have long been a fan of the Mad Greek in Baker, California.  For years, every trip to Cali has included a stop at this historic and amazing restaurant, and it has never failed to please.  Massive, wonderfully thick milkshakes, mouthwatering well spiced gyro meat, AMAZING cheeseburgers, the best fried zucchini you've ever tried.  The original location in Baker is out of this world...

So when they started opening them right here in Vegas, it's needless to say that I was THRILLED...and then I ate here, at the location on Sahara.  I don't know who trained these cooks, but they must love their spices.  I've had Thai food that wasn't this spicy.  I ordered a Gyro, a Cheeseburger, an order of Fried Zucchini, and 2 milkshakes for my wife and I.  

The gyro and cheeseburger both got thrown away after about 2 bites because they were somehow lacking flavor while at the same time being too spicy to eat.  I really have no idea how they managed it.  The zucchini was slimy and limp.  the milkshakes were the only part of the meal that we finished, and while being better than average, they were nowhere near the foodgasm experience that I am willing to drive 2 hours to enjoy.

They call this the Mad Greek...Their name is the same.  Their menu is mostly the same.  Their prices are about the same.  Their decor is the same.  Their food is NOT.  If you are an avid Mad Greek fan from way back, do not come here expecting the food that you know and love from that California gem.  

This place embodies why so many restaurants fail when they try to expand into additional locations.  The quality suffers and they lose their regulars.  As much as I love the idea of having one close to home, I'll wait for my next trip to go back to the original.  This one is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love the decor. The lunch specials are $7.99 are you get plenty of food. The kalamata olives were so good. We have had a difficult time finding a restaurant with good olives to go with the salads. I can't wait til we go on a friday or saturday night to enjoy the entertainment. Food was just as good as my Yia Yia's"}

Yelp Challege 2011

My last night in Las Vegas.  Tia and Jesse gave me a gift certificate to the Mad Greek Cafe.  Jesse told me that he couldn't really eat anything at this restaurant and he received the gift certificate as a thank you gift for placing an ad for his garage door installation business.

I'd never been to such a HUGE Greek restaurant ever!  There were white Greek lawn ornaments on the roof of their restaurant, a dance floor inside, and a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

I ordered the stuffed grape leaves (my favorite) and their small Greek salad.  The grape leaves didn't come with any dipping sauce, but they were still good.

There was a crazy hamburger on the menu that consisted of a heaping of pastrami on top of the burger patty!  I don't usually order burgers at restaurants, so I just read about it."}
{"text":"This location on the strip is gone, there is a taco place instead. Mad Greek is off strip up Sahara now"}
{"text":"I always enjoy dining at The Mad Greek. I love their gyro and calamari daily lunch specials. They have an awesome patio which you can enjoy in some of this beautiful weather we've been blessed with and nothing better than a meal and a cigar if you enjoy cigars. 

I order the fried calamari often for lunch which comes with an ample serving of calamari, rice or fries (love their rice) and a salad. They've always been with the perfect light coating of flour/spices and cooked to perfection as we all know as simple of a dish calamari is, it can be a miserable experience when not prepared correctly. Have no fear, The Mad Greek is here for your calamari cravings!:)"}
{"text":"I got the combo but its best to just get the lamb gyro on its own with the tzatziki sauce. Very filling and yummy with a soda."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in sections, as I'm eating these foods....
Our order consists of a Gyro plate, Hamburger for the wife, Fried Zucchini and Saganaki.
Saganaki (aka Hopa Cheese) is bitter and there was no presentation, I'm disappointed
The Fried Zucchini are fairly decent but they have a good ranch dressing.
 The Hamburger leaves a lot to be desired, flavoreless.
 The Gyro plate was ok, I thought it was funny that the waiter couldn't pronounce it, so that was   cool
 I didn't think this place was so fast food style. Maybe I caught it on a bad day but I won't be coming back but I've been craving good Greek food so maybe I'll try somewhere else,"}
{"text":"Appetizer Tuesday. The Baklava was amazing with a touch of cinnamon & not sweet & gooey like others. Also the pita bread was light & fluffy. The Tz sauce was the best I have ever tasted. A little noisy but food was good. Very extensive menu."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time today for lunch.  I had the Mad Greek Salad; my two co workers had the kefta plate and the mad greek chicken.  I tried a bit of both, and they tasted delicious!  My pita bread with the salad was very soft and fluffy.  I think it's a bit over-priced for lunch, but I would definitely come back!

Oh, and they take telephone orders, so you don't have to wait at the drive-thru!"}
{"text":"I've read over some of the reviews, and I feel like this place is getting a beating by my fellow yelpers.

I wouldn't say I'm a Mediterranean food connoisseur, but I know good food.

This place has good food.  

My fiancé and I stumbled in there for dinner on Christmas day.  We had celebrated with family on Christmas Eve and all day Christmas and we wanted to \"get away\" for some \"us\" time.  We walked in and were seated right away.  They were slow because EVERYTHING in Summerlin was closed that day and people probably figured they were too.  I was surprised that they had a HUGE FULL bar, a karaoke stage, dance floor, huge projection tv, and the blue lighting made the place seem fun and festive.  I could definitely see a birthday party there.

Anyways, we ordered the hummus and pita, lamb shank plate, and lamb gyro.  EVERYTHING was good.  the hummus, the pita (which we got more of at no charge), the lamb, the GYRO was amazing, and the rice.  Dang that rice was good!

I am giving them 5 stars because the food was AWESOME.  Yes, the service could probably be better (waitress had to be reminded of things, but was SUPER nice), but we're talking $11-$17 meals.  It's not an arm and a leg ...and you're getting generous portions in a fun environment with relatively nice service.  So, I would gladly, GLADLY have the \"okay\" service and awesome food for that price.

After all, it's all about the food isn't it? :)"}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed. Heard a lot about this place and couldnt wait to try it. Sadly, the only tedeeming quality to this place is their fries. Our server was not very accomodating nor was he knowledgeable about what the burgers had as toppings. I really just got the impression that he didnt care. The burgers we ordered were sloppy, and did not meet expectations whatsoever. This place really needs to get some better servers. Will not dine here again."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! Piping hot gyros, yummy margaritas and the kindest waitstaff!"}
{"text":"We were looking for another Greek/Mediterranean restaurant but our GPS took us into this area. When we found out it wasn't the place, we decided to eat here instead. We were starving and noticed that they had a 50% off appetizers during happy hour and we were right on time for happy hour. 

The restaurant itself was decorated in a gaudy style with murals of the Acropolis and other Greek style architecture on the walls and ceilings. They have a full sized bar which during HH, all drinks are discounted, even non-alcoholic ones.

We hadn't looked at yelp prior to visiting obviously, but after our meal, I managed to look at the reviews on here and the other reviewers were spot on regarding the book of the menu. The listings are really confused with Japanese and Italian offerings as well -- namely, sashimi and pasta.

We stuck to the appetizer menu which consists of cold appetizers and hot appetizers -- taking up 3 pages.

Taramosalata -- this wasn't bad but the taste of caviar did not come through

Melanzanasalata -- or something like that  -- eggplant dip. This was nice and had a tart finish

Spanokopita -- FAIL! The Trader Joe's version is far better. It was obvious that they had originally baked it and then when someone orders it, they popped it into the deep fryer to heat it up. Totally disgusting!!

Falafel -- not grainy but rather, mushy and very dense! I didn't like these much

Dolmas -- their version had meat and rice inside instead of just rice. There is also this creamy-ish white sauce on it which didn't enhance these at all. Pass!

Greek pizza -- pretty awful even the young man didn't want to eat it. We took it back to the hotel but no one even attempted to eat it so we ended up throwing it away. 

Greek cheese and olive plate -- this was a winner. We liked this one a lot. Two types of cheeses were offered along with Kalamata olives.

Did I think the food was good? Not particularly. But some items weren't bad, the rest, just plain awful. If I had to pay full price I'd definitely tell you to pass! It's not worth it. However, at 50% off, our bill was actually quite reasonable for what we ate. I was even able to overlook some of the grosser items. Hubby had two drinks, one alcoholic and a Greek cherry juice. I had an iced tea. Our bill? About $40. Now double it and you're looking at $80. For $80 I'd say it was a totally awful meal. For $40? It's easier to swallow!

2.5 stars."}

Well I'm never ordering them again  and i am greek and Italian   

 capers are Italian  and they forgot parsley& onions in the KEFTEDES"}
{"text":"The BF and I are always up to find open late places on our way back home from work so we were excited to see Mad Greeks drive thru open.

 It was so hard to even find the information online about this place even existing to make a Yelp listing. I did know it was affiliated with the Mad Greek Cafe in Baker and even with that, there wasn't much about it....what place doesn't have a website in this day and age?! I remember vaguely stopping in Baker and the food being okay, though very salty so I thought this will be nothing like our favorite spot, but it will do. Man, how wrong were we.

We got kofta meatball sandwich, falafel sandwich and spanakopita. 

Spanakopita was filled with a oddly lightly sweet tasting filling, not a earthy spinach and stinky bite of feta. It was reheated and tasted burnt from how long it was in there for. Falafel was burnt, but the filling inside it just didn't taste homemade so it wouldn't have mattered if it was properly cooked. Kofta meatballs were OK though I had reservations about it as the meatballs looked unappetizing. You know when you cook ground meat on the grill and white fats ooze out of it? I normally scoop most off the grill and make sure to nicely char the meat so what is on it becomes flavor instead of grease. They let it ooze and didn't grill the patties long enough to take it off. 

It has been a long time since the BF and I have ordered something so bad that we couldn't eat it. It also wasn't cheap and that made it even more disappointing that we could have gotten a substantial meal for less. Sandwiches were $7 each and spankopita was $3. 

I don't see this staying open very long specially since it's close to other Mediterranean restaurants."}
{"text":"I love the Mad Greek in Baker,, the one here off Rainbow,, not so much....  Gyro is ok nothing special, better than Gyro Time but not by much....  Skip this one,, get the one in Baker,, a special treat if you make that drive to LA..."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review might offend you if you aren't Greek and take jokes too seriously.
 
They should call this place The Bad Greek. Actually, maybe the name is a warning... \"if you arrive here a happy Greek once you try our terrible food you will leave a Mad Greek\".  I don't know who is back there making the food, but the cook should be sent to live with the Turks in Cyprus for being so impressively bad at being Greek. Maybe this place was opened by a Turkish housewife as a passive-aggressive jab at the Greeks. I could sit and do nothing but speculate all day as to how these people got so truly terrible at life, but then I would get hungry eventually, which might cause me to need to eat more of their crappy food.

Kidding aside, we Greeks are a very hungry people.  If you are luring starving Greeks to your establishment, the most important thing you should know is that eating is not a joke to us.  So don't burn the freaking spanakopita.  Especially if you didn't even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of filling in it... ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt \"spinach pie\" nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??  And why did the nibblets consist of almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  This I do not like. This is merely a reminder of what could have been.

Everything else was mediocre at best...
Pre-made cheap Italian dressing on my Anatolia salad that you can't call a \"salata\" unless you want to confuse them.
Dolmades piled sloppily under a sea of bland mystery sauce, loosely rolled as though they were Taco Bell burritos, filled with unvarying smoosh and what appeared to be instant rice.
Pre-crumbled feta... WTF?  Are they really so lazy that they cringe at the prospect of clasping their hand a few times to break up some blocks of feta?!

None of this should matter to any Greek reading this... Because they had the audacity to serve me badly burnt spanakopita with no filling.  It was like a pastry version of the worst frozen potstickers you've ever eaten.  How dare they!!

What they have created in the charliefoxtrot (clusterfffff) that is The Mad Greek is worse than spitting on my food... They have spit on my soul.  Don't mess with hungry Greeks!!!  Not cool.  Every time someone goes here to eat someone's yiayia drops dead... So save a yiayia and don't ever eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about the decor in this restaurant, but it gives off a sort of sober feel to the ambience. Maybe it's all of the shades of blue used. 

Now that my complaining is out of the way, on to the good parts. First of all - the escargot! Oh my juicy snail goodness! Not only are they perfectly cooked and seasoned, but they provide the largest portion of escargot I've come across in Vegas. With that for a starter, I'm sold. I went with the grill plate - a mountain of meats with seasoned rice. While I wasn't a fan of the meatballs, every other item on the platter was delicious. Finished off with a couple of glasses of wine and you've got a very happy fat kid. 

The staff is extremely accommodating, offering up suggestions and even teaching me the proper pronunciation for the spanakopita. All in all, I would say this place is amazing - just cheer up the room a bit and you're set!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Greek and Mediterrean restaurants, so at this point I have a good reference for what I should expect.  Overall, the food was good, as was the service and time to wait for the order.  More specifically, the food was good, but not any better than other places I have been that were more reasonably priced.  I am willing to dish it out for a nice meal, but the prices at this place seemed a little high considering what you are getting.  The outdoor seating they have at this place seems to be a favorite of a number of chain smokers, as the entire meal was complemented by the fragrant aroma of cigarette smoke.  The interior is... very Greek.  I unfortunately will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I came here with a freebie gyro coupon, and I must say it was way bigger than expected, not dry and the yogurt sauce was tasty, but wish I had a little more, as I ate half and save half for the next day, with no sauce : (   . Yes the average cost for a gyro is $7-8, which is about right... And service was fast and friendly..."}
{"text":"Came here armed with a freebie for a free gyro, I am there, tried it out and have to say the gyro was small and salty,dry too,, but service was great,, but probably will not go back, sorry , just cannot take too much salt in my food..."}
{"text":"Greek salad and gyro snack for $8 during their 11am-7pm happy hour (really more of a happy day, no?) is a will-do-ya snack. They are $4 each and okay. The gyro meat is standard fare. However, you will have to experience an explosion of Greek decor and an equally massive menu. The mere size of the menu leaves you concerned that things can't be too fresh, and for me, it has a psychological effect. Can they really serve up the best steak, freshest fish and Greek egg rolls done right?  

The seemingly low prices trick you into ordering a lot more and before we knew it we had spent a little over $40. I tried the babaganoush, and despite big hunks of eggplant, I thought it was fair. The pita was what I would describe as the white bread equivalent of pita, thick and doughy, which can be good, but I appreciate a lighter pita.

Our server was nice even though she did forget to bring our drinks until after the first round of food had hit the table. I can't really put my finger on it, but the overall experience didn't leave me eager to return. I think less clutter and a streamlined menu would make a big difference."}
{"text":"A little pricey for just a gyro ($10) but well worth it!  The gyro was pretty bomb.  I can honestly say it was the best gyro i have ever had in my life.  The homemade tzsiki sauce (sp?) was sooo good, it was literally the icing on the cake haha 

definitely a stop for me on the way to vegas or on the way home from vegas because its open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I really should have checked out the Yelp review for this place BEFORE I decided to visit it on a whim.

I really wanted to like this place. My brother's wife's mother owns a restaurant called the Mad Greek, which is a fabulous place. I thought for sure, any place that shares the name would share the food and atmosphere. I guess I was mistaken.

So before I walk in I look at the sign to see if they were open. The sign was off, so I probably should have taken the hint and left, but I decided to go in anyway. I am greeted by a waiter, who is in the middle of taking someone's order, and who I cannot seem to understand. I just end up walking out to the patio area because it seemed like fresh air would be nice. Well fresh air mixed with smoke would have to do.

So a minute or two later, the waitress comes up and gives me the menu to look at and takes my drink order. When she comes back I immediately order an appetizer, the baba ganoush. She seems totally clueless as to what I just ordered and nearly yanks the menu out of my hands so she can take it with her because she needs it to remember the order. I know, WTF?

The baba ganoush comes nearly immediately. My guess is that they have it premade and just slap it on a dish and go. I tell the waitress that I need a minute to decide for my entree. It turns out that I need a minute equates to don't come and check on me for literally 20 minutes! In fact I don't see the waitress again until after my order comes back, so instead I end up flagging down the bus boy who luckily came out to clean up the table of the only other group that was out on the patio. 

I ask him to get the waitress, but he insists that he can take my order, in very broken English I can barely understand. I tell him my order and he is sounds confused. So I point to the two items on the menu. The guy still seems a little clueless, but walks off repeating the order to himself, only to return moments later. He has a pen, highlights menu items I ordered, and takes the menu with him. At this point I'm really unsure if I'll even be getting what I ordered if neither the waitress nor the bus boy can remember very simplistic orders.

After all is said and done, the food was not very appetizing. I ate little but the baba ganoush (which was decent) and I ended up taking the okra home. I told the waitress not to box the soup that I hardly touched. So she asks, \"Didn't you like it?\" At that point I was kind of dumbfounded. Why else would I ask NOT to take it home. It was that atrocious. Do I have to spell it out?

Now that I see the other reviews I don't feel so horrible giving this place one star. It seems there is a consensus on this place. I really need to get an iPhone already so I can check reviews before I make these bad dining decisions."}
{"text":"If you want to stop off to see the worlds largest thermometer and have some food, then this stop is for you. The Mad Greek in itself is an ok place. There are two locations; one in Baker (near Death Valley) and then one near the entrance to LV. It's usually packed so if you like Greek food, then this may be for you. From what I remember, the falalel balls were tasty and weren't overly fried. A creamy Tahini sauce accompanies most dishes which is perfect since the weather here is HOT! The restaurant designed with roman statues and columns on the outside so you can't miss it when you are exiting. The inside is more like a greek cafeteria and is congested with a lot of seating space and people to match. The Baker stop has an option for a decent bathroom and like I said before, if you look to the left of the Mad Greek, you will see a large pole showing the temperature. This is the only one found in America and although it boasts that it shows the right temperature, its actually off a couple of degrees."}
{"text":"That Strawberry Shake though!!  It'll make a fat girl jog!  LOL!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I've lived in the area for many years and I've seen this restaurant
Change from once Greek place to another and have been always curious.  I can say now, never again.

We came early, based on other yelp reviews I was excited to try out the happy hour menu. The waitress hands us the most confusing menu I've ever seen. There's a space with a piece of paper with new menu items taped over one section, and black sharpie crossing things out.  I did not see the happy hour menu, so when I asked our waitress about it she explained that they no longer serve happy hour because they've updated their menu with lunch specials. I found this was strange. Service over all was okay, but the waitress seemed a bit confused.

On to the horrible!
Bacon wrapped shrimp-4 tiny pieces of charcoal were delivered to us. Shrimp1 looked burnt but as I bit close to the tail it was frozen, shrimp 2 was burnt on the outside raw on the inside. Obviously the cook took frozen shrimp, wrapped bacon sound it, and put it under the broiler until it was burnt, thinking the shrimp would be cooked.
Babbaganosh- This was okay, not the best I've ever had. But the only thing we readily ate.
Meat (?) pita- not sure if this was beef or lamb since we were never asked  what meat we wanted, but again it was thrown under a broiler and over cooked so it really didn't matter what kinda of meat it was. Everything else on the platter was average.
Ground beef with cheese- I don't remember what this was called on the menu. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and it was of course extra well done and burnt outside. The seasoning and meat was tender and good, they need to serve this meatball style. But where's the cheese??? It was supposed to have Kayseri cheese, but I saw cheese nowhere.

There has some interesting things that on the menu that I would like to try, but not there.  They clearly feel like having a million crappy menu items (potstickers anyone) is better than having attention to detail and a handful of good, well cooked menu items that highlight  the ethnicity of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 3 stars, I was standoffish about eating there because of it. My experience at around 1:15 pm was great. They have great 7 plus lunch specials. Everything was delicious.  The home made pita bread was so fresh tasting and the best pita bread I've had, although I haven't eaten at a lot of Greek restaurants, my dining companion has and agreed. She also ordered the Baba ghanoush appetizer, I have never had that but, I keep dreaming about it and I don't even like eggplant that much. The chicken breast I had was phenomenal! The seasoning they use is delicious and they did not overlook my chicken, it's was perfectly juicy! I was very pleased, so much so that I wish I lived closer. It would be my regular spot for a healthy lunch or dinner.
Here is a great tip, my friend goes at least once a week with her friends, they have some kind of deal going on, if you buy a glass of wine you get an appetizer, if you order a bottle, I believe it's 4. You can't beat that. So, if you can get over the obnoxious and strange Greek decor, and you like Greek food this place is yummy and ever so reasonable. They also have a patio if you like eating outside."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant last night and we'll happily stumble on this restaurant again anytime! Before I continue I want to share that my family's appetite grows exponentially when we're together and their The Feast dish fed us all with leftovers. Besides having to order a second Greek salad and ask for more pita chips, there was enough to feed us five. Their decor's a bit much for my taste - and the reason for my star deduction - but this is Vegas after all. I'm adding this place to my go-to Las Vegas restaurants and recommend them to anyone with a huge appetite craving tasty Greek food. 

P.S. I did also order their avgolemono and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying if I could leave a ZERO RATING I would.  My two friends and I were excited to try this place out as my friend recently moved into the area and wanted to begin exploring the dining options.  We walked in and was promptly greeted (only silver of customer service for the rest of our short time there) and sat at a nearby table.  Time continued on and we were NEVER looked at again - No water, no check up to see if we were ready to order.  There were only 2 servers - BUT mind you we were 1 of 2 parties to be served.  We couldn't believe it when a 3rd party walked in and they were greeted, sat, given water, AND got their orders taken within 5 minutes of walking through the door.  We were there sitting idle for a good 10-15 minutes before we decided to spend our hard earned cash elsewhere.  We were futher dismissed by the smug server when my friend advised her to pay better attention to their diners.  

VERY disappointing.  And I hate to ever mention it -- but could it be we were least on their list as we were the only Asians there?"}
{"text":"The food was bland and the service terrible. The waitress actually asked us if we could pay our bill so she could go home. It was five pm and we were not finished yet. 
The decor does remind you of Greece though!"}
{"text":"Was ok till the singer started, we left! To fill in a few gaps the gyro bread was too thick to fold and the yogurt sauce was runny, the kebabs came off the stake, as note else where the grape leaf meal was good. The wine had a heavy markup. Would I go again, yes for the good serving."}
{"text":"Much better than the ones in Primm and Baker, the Mad Greek Cafe attempts to satisfy the greek craving and to some extent it succeeds.  Many of the options taste very good.  I think what keeps this restaurant from jumping to the next level is 1) there are way too many menu items and no restaurant can make that many items equally tasty.  The non-greek items are often made with a greek spice or flavor much to the dismay of the children eaters.  2) the service is inconsistent.  While the manager (perhaps owner) knows what he is doing, the waitresses often do not even know all the menu items or what item can be substituted for what item.

Still, we have never had a bad meal.  Also, they have live music on certain days which looks like it might be fun.  We haven't made it there yet though."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Took 45 minutes to get order and it wasn't even right.  Watched other guests, who arrived well after we did, order, eat and leave all before we even got our salads.  After bringing this to the attention to our waiter, all he kept doing was giving excusses.  

What ever happened to ownership, customer service, or plain out letting us know you didn't put our order in.  Instead of an HONEST reply, we just got more excuses and no appology.  


Won't ever go again and definitely will not recommend.  In fact, will let all those that we have told to go there, not to waste your time.  Unless, you have an hour to kill before you actually get a salad."}
{"text":"Sub par food. Waiting time is terrible, didn't get drinks for 30 min and food for like 1 1/2 hours. Just cause there's a party going on doesn't mean you ignore your other customers"}
{"text":"Love the food. Gyro was bomb so was the hummus. BUT the waiter was greedy and didn't give me my change. Yea like I was about to leave you a $6 tip when my food was about $14. 

Don't assume. Just give the customers the change and the tip will be left on the table for you. THEN you take the money and keep it, not before you give the change."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Why? Because I love the Mad Greek in Baker. I get in that long line, never look at the menu, when it's my turn I order the falafel. Never had anything else ... Falafel, tahini, rice, pita, small salad ... It's always excellent!!

Went to this locale last week since the outside decor made me think that the food would be as good as the Baker locale. Not so ...

The guy said they were the same company, same menu.
I ordered the falafel of course. Extra $2 for rice or fries, What?! Ok, I ordered rice. When my meal arrived, there were fries. Good thing I didn't send it back because those fries were the best part. Maybe the turnover is slower but the falafel were heavy, pita was not as light & fluffy, and they were out of tahini so he gave me hummus.

I'll give them one more try, even though this visit was very disappointing. Maybe they'll get their act together. This place is far from my home but a lot closer than Baker!!"}
{"text":"Waited a LONG time for them to complete their remodel.  It was well worth it!!
The food is amazing!!  
Wonderful hummus, tzadziki, gyros....
I would highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I go here for either lunch or dinner. The gyro's are the best ever!!! The lunch meals are super cheap you just gotta try this place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We were the first in the restaurant for lunch. I'm used to great Greek food in Florida, so I was disappointed with the Mad Greek. First off, it's got a very cheesy atmosphere. You can tell the owner tried to make it look nice with its white washed walls, blue accents on everything and a chandelier in the dining room. But ultimately? It looks like a hodgepodge of everything Greek, white, and blue with a bare bones table setting. NOT impressive.

Our waitress forgot to give us two menus, silverware, and napkins. We ordered iced tea, and it turns out it's some kind of passion fruit tea even though it isn't listed as such. Menu looks like a mess, too. Makes it feel less like a reputable restaurant. We finally gave up on figuring out what to order and just had calamari to snack on. It was good calamari, but not good enough to warrant coming back just for them. I think the only part I really enjoyed was the ample basket of toasted pita bread that came with it.

Not to mention, the patronage is odd. We sat between a table of very old people in suits and a table of head-to-toe tattooed gangsters sipping a strawberry shake with whipped cream. Picture that. It was worth a laugh. But ultimately, the decor and service left something to be desired. Will try a different Greek restaurant the next time I get a Gyro craving."}
{"text":"Would give it a neg star if I could worst food and service ever"}
{"text":"So we were back on this side if town and excited to have an excuse to return. Hate to say it but we were disappointed. Zucchini fingers were not crisp. They actually bent in half when you picked them up. Also, they no longer serve them with tatziki (sp?) sauce but will charge you $1 extra for a really small container. Um, isn't that like going to an American diner and being charged extra for ketchup?  Also, the zucchini desperately needed salt. 

My beef and lamb gyro was ok. A little dry. Hubby had their famous Oscar burger that comes with pastrami on it, which was dry. 

The little salad that came with the meal seemed to have a cup of dressing on it. Yikes!

Sorry to say but won't be stopping by again. Better Greek food at Stephanos which is closer to us anyway."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to join the group at Rumour for Yelp drinks, but being temporarily heavily medicated, I decided to forgo it and meet my regular Wednesday Ladies' Night Out group, who chose the Mad Greek, just because.  The bonus was my Restaurant.com certificate.

I would have loved to sit in the patio, but it was too chilly.  Have they not heard of patio heaters?  With all the renovation that went on here, you'd think they could have run over to Costco and bought a few of 'em.  But nooooo.  There was one measly gas-fed fire pit in the center of a table.  It had a real log burning, but the remaining table space wouldn't have been big enough for any plates.  So we sat inside.

Black and white marble tile floors are surrounded by white walls and those big industrial heating ducts painted in Greek Isles blue.  I could have been on Mykonos - or Israel.  Same colors.

We waited a long time for someone to take our drink orders.  We were just ordering coffee, but it took forever to arrive.  Mine - the high test version - was room temp, so I sent it back.  But it wasn't replaced until we managed to snag a waiter, which would have been easier if just one of us had a cane with a big hook.  Our waiter kept flying by so fast that it was almost necessary to trip him to get his attention.

Three of us decided to share an order of saganaki, a Greek salad, and the 17-item appetizer assortment.  The fourth, on a special diet, ordered grilled salmon.

The salmon came out charred, dried out and overcooked, and she had to send it back.  The replacement was okay, but nothing to write home about.  She said it tasted like it had enjoyed a lengthy vacation in the freezer.

The saganaki was blah.  It tasted to me like fried fish.  Not to the others, but they didn't like it, either.  The Greek salad was very nice, but was a little stingy on the feta.  

The appetizer platter is said to serve two people, but with the other stuff we ordered, it was too much for us three.  It was uneven:  the calamari were terrible:  soggy, too chewy, and not hot enough.  The gyro meat was way too salty for me, but then, everything always is.  It also had decent tabbouli, eggplant salad, beef sausage, ground kebab meat, but mediocre hummus, a completely charred pepper, and two boring chicken wings.

The food wasn't bad enough to say that I'd never return, but it sure needs some improvement.  The patio is definitely a plus, hence the extra star.  But it will have to be much warmer to get me back to this place.

The best part came at the end.  With the coupon, the whole food experience cost the three of us who shared the meal just $10 each, and that's including the 18% gratuity that was added on.  And the waiter regaled us each with a piece of baklava to take home, which was a very nice touch, considering we'd spent so little.  That and the patio will get me to go back."}
{"text":"Life in the Suburbs is lot different than the famous Strip (away from the Night Clubs, which are traps, established by Venture Capitalists, to part the money from the tourists mostly unsuspecting Japanese tourists, for promises of paradise, that was never delivered-only the paradise rd. ) When you are driving North on Durango and just before Sahara, you notice an ordinary looking Greek Cafe and the lure of the Gyro entices you to go in. When you are in you realize this is not a Cafe but a Greek Palace. The ornate and classy furnishings reminds you of  Caesar's Palace off the Strip. The Aegean Aesthetics is pleasing and soothing.

Then you see if the food matches the decor. In my opinion of all the Greek places I have eaten...Yes. The gyro is a culinary invention  like the Chicken Tikka and Pizza. A vertical spit that is openly displayed at other cheap Greek places (like the rotating spectrum in barber shops) is hidden.  It is the best gyro I had, (other than \"Nicks Gyro\" on Touhy and Harlem, in Park Ridge, Illinois.) The Gyro is well done, the pita bread crisp not soggy, right amount of onion and the zatiziki sauce...oh the sauce. How did mankind exist without this sauce? The taste is just out of this world specially gulped down with a Greek red wine not beer (beer tends to fill you up and takes where as a chilled red wine before and during the meal is better for the digestion.) The other item I tried was Chicken and Lamb Kebabs. The only other place I have had that kind of kebabs was at Marrakesh on Paradise Rd. They even have belly dancers on last Wednesday of the month with a Variety Dinner Show. Can't beat this place for the money and the ambiance.

The portions are huge and the food is as fresh you can get and is is fast. The bar which is one of the best stocked bars has video machines and assortment of world beers. The service can be spotty at times but if you are not in hurry-which is a shame-when you are dining in a classy place like this. They even have a gazebo."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything about our lunch/dinner here tonight our server was lovely and well Greek food always takes awhile when it's as fresh as it was! Delicious gyros and platters and there ice tea is so good!! Our new favorite local spot"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour over the weekend and had a relatively pleasant meal. 

We ordered a pitcher of mango mojitos, which were pretty good albeit a little sugary. For tapas we ordered broiled calamari, bacon wrapped dates, spinach puff, crab and shrimp puff and something else I can't remember at the moment. The price was ok, considering we got a pitcher of mojitos that amounted to about three full cups each for me and my fella. 

The food didn't blow me away and the service was incredibly slow in the beginning. Our waitress apologized profusely for keeping us waiting so long and was pleasant and helpful for the rest of our meal. 

All in all, good place for happy hour, which is 4-7 daily. They also have certificates available for purchase through the restaurant .com site, but they are not valid for happy hour items."}
{"text":"good quality gyro.  now they have breakfast gimmicks like gyro & egg burritos, lamb breakfast sandwich, gyro omlette.  great iced green & jasmine tea.  tried the gyro burrito & would get it again."}
