{"text":"When I visited Chinatown last month, I found new Ramen restaurant \"shokuraku\". I really like a ramen from Japan. 
There are good. Taste, interiors and services were perfect for me.
I got some ramen- I don't remember that name - kind of chicken ramen. It was yummy! 
So if you want a ramen in Chinatown, try!!!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 12 at 1pm on a Sunday. Service was slow and the food came out slowly. Some of us only got our food when the first of us finished. One guy waited an hour for his dumplings. Food quality was about average. Prices are typical of ramen places in Toronto but for these prices there are better options."}
{"text":"I notice a few things should be changed to improve.

1. Food is so so slow. If three more than people come, the cooking time will be taken at least 30 minutes, even when we went to the restaurant, nobody was eating food. We were five people at that time and two of us had to wait 15miutes more and Also, we ordered side dish: dumpling but, the chef forgot to make it so, we had to wait time a lot. I think the chef has to be more carefully.

2. The flavor of soup should be more tasty. Many people the reason why they go to the ramen restaurants is they want to eat tasty soup, but, this place's soup has very little tasty compared as other restaurants such as santouka or ryouji. Of course, the noodle is also not tasty seriously.

The only good thing is it was quite clean and nice service at the restaurant. But, the important thing is tasty ! If the taste is the best, the environment is not important even though it would be normal or less.

I wish no more people won't come out anymore. :("}
{"text":"This is the worst Ramen place I've ever been to! Went around 1pm on a Saturday. Walked in, the waitress sat us down, gave us the menu, took her 10 minutes to offer us water, and tell us that they don't have chicken based ones. Ok I'll take the mushroom based ones. Took her 20 minutes to tell me they don't have mushroom based ones either. Ok I'll just take the soy sauce based ones then. Took her another 20 minutes to serve the noodle, and it was cold! She didn't even warn me about the difference! And the store was not busy at all! Never going to that place again. I would not suggest anyone go there."}
{"text":"Had shokuraku ramen, and shared karaage with a friend.  The soup was awesome. Not so pricy, very clean and comfortable place."}
