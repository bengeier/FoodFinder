{"text":"This bar has been around for 4 years and went there for the first time tonight. Was always told it was a dump only to be pleasantly surprised. It is a clean, nicely decorated bar that has a friendly atmosphere. The service was exceptional and the food was spectacular. The table ordered wings, fish and chips, seafood soup, calamari, and poutine deluxe. The poutine deluxe was fries with real cheese curds, chicken, bacon bits and jalapenos. I tried everything except the fish and chips was more than happy with everything. Our resident fish and chip guy who tries them everywhere he goes could not stop raving about them and was even happier with the price with a full order of haddock and chips for $5.00 on Fridays. Two of us had the seafood soup and it was very tasty not a lot of seafood but the flavour of it made up for it. The wings were roster wings and cooked to perfection and the sauce was home made and tasty as hell. This might have been my first time there but definitely will not be my last."}
{"text":"Best Wings I have ever had!!!!!!

I am a regular at Ellen's. There every Wednesday. Wednesday is Wing Night, and my boyfriend and myself are there, rain/snow/storm/shine. Yes, went there during a snow storm, just for the wings. Well I lie, we go there for the service too. KIM, is the main server, and she really knows how to take care of customers; not just us regulars. She is very friendly and attentive. she is the shining star at Ellen's. Kevin, he works in the kitchen, cooking those delicious wings, such a great guy as well. He knows how to make the wings so tasty, and is super nice, when you talk to him.

Aside from the wings being delicious, so are the fries, salad(yes I love my salads) potato skins, poutine, and burgers. 

It is nestled in a grimy strip mall; a little hidden. But, when you find it, you will be happy you did. 

Great food and great Service makes this a spot you must come check out.

Tell Kim, Kesha sent you and she'll take care of you!"}

{"text":"Awesome food. Clean modern decor.Great service.  Waitress was super cute too. Lol.
Burger was tasty. Homemade fries done right.  
Wings were great and huge. 10.99 for a pound which was only 7 wings but presentation was lovely. Carrot sticks and ranch included. 
Friends had Philly steak snd Chicken Parmesan.  Both served on  fresh Chibata buns.
Various specials all week.
Definitely a gem worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's in an awful looking strip mall, but it's clean and cozy. The prices are reasonable and the specials are exceptional. Their wings and fish and chips are both outstanding. [They used to serve awful basa, but they've upgraded to haddock]. 
 I'm surprised it isn't a lot more popular, but that's a good thing for those in the know, if not the owners."}
{"text":"I knew it wasn't likely to be a good time when I saw the Papyrus font on the sign but a friend's band was performing and who was I to say no?

The experience was not a total disappointment if only because my table had a good laugh guessing what else was going to be bad. Here's a short list:

- Weirdly designed seating that is not at all conducive to live music
- Tried the home-brew beer because I always like to support this sort of thing at bars. DON'T TRY THE HOME BREW BEER.
- Friends ordered Budweiser draft twice and each time were brought bottles instead
- Slow service with only about 2 bartenders/servers on a Saturday night. We made the mistake of asking one for drinks when she came to clear glasses only to be rebutted with \"I'm not your server.\" Eek.
- I ordered a \"two-handed burger.\" They got the type of burger wrong. Also, if you're going to imply your burgers are huge, the product should probably deliver at least an average sized burger. It was more like a kids meal.
- Waitress could not answer the most basic questions about the menu. I.e. \"What is your house salad dressing?\"

I know this is a dive bar and I swear I didn't go there expecting much. But somehow received even less than I expected."}
{"text":"Blue collar drinking hole, no pretensions but very well appointed and service is great. Family atmosphere with people working there, plus active ownership who greet all customers. 

A current go to for me during the week, highly recommend for after work drinks and nibbles."}
