{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the chicken is good, and you'll never get attitude from the person behind the counter because you don't speak Portuguese. The thing that lowers their rating from me is they never have chicken ready in the early afternoon. While I understand that it probably takes a while to prepare and you can't have everything all the time, I don't get why they open with a sandwich board outside promoting a chicken special when they don't have chicken yet.  Their competitors don't have this issue, so I go there instead, despite the fact that I really do want to support these guys."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ... What was super good was the smoked sardines.  They are better than any other place I've had them.  The place was clean, food was good and the people there are nice... I will go back for more.."}
{"text":"I recently moved quite close to this place but never really paid it much attention until this past week.  April is thier 1 year anniversary and they posted a sign outside with some month long specials, one being a full rotisserie chicken for $6.99.   The chickens looked pretty huge in the window so I couldn't resist popping in there today and picking up a chicken to take home for dinner.  It's very clean and tidy inside. There is seating for 20-30 people, but nothing fancy, looks like it mostly used as a take out joint.   The owners were both Portuguese and kept apologizing profusely that I had to wait 5 minutes or so for my chicken to be ready. (I had showed up around 6pm and everyone seemed to have the same idea of taking home a cheap rotisserie chicken for dinner)  While I waited, they insisted I had a free drink, so I sipped a diet coke while I waited a few minutes. They took the chicken off the spit, cut it into pieces and barbequed it on a hot grill with some kind of lemon juice coated overtop, typical Portugeuse style.  They also gave me a free side dish of choice for waiting. Whole chicken, free roast potatoes and a diet coke all for $6.99 - not bad!  The chicken was tasty, so were the roast potatoes. I'd go back. Don't think I'd eat in but it's a good place to grab something to bring home. They also do ribs and the typical side dishes to go with. Kind of like Swiss Chalet only properly Portuguese ;)"}
{"text":"4 stars until April 30/10!  If you live in Annex/Koreatown or are by near dinner time.  $6.99 Rotisserie chicken special.  Thought I'd try it out based on Lauren M.'s rec as I'm often in the area and like her had never really noticed the place.  Chicken was good at a very good price.  Went back to try the 1/3 ribs + side special - didn't care for it - wasn't a very barbeque-y tasting sauce on the ribs - but was ok value on the special.  I might go here sparingly after the end of April, if I was already coming by, as at their regular pricing I'd rather go somewhere else or make my own food at home."}
