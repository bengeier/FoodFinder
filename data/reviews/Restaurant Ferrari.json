{"text":"I was not impressed with this place.  My mother had the shrimp which was pretty good, but I had a bruschetta pizza, and it was insanely salty.  I actually put a lot of salt on my food and it was too much even for me.  We did not get bread with our meal although everyone else seemed to.  I ordered a glass of wine and I could tell that the bottle had been open for too long.  The waiter that was serving us went home half way through the meal.  The pie was from a freezer and cold.  We ordered regular coffee but it was made with an espresso machine and was far too strong!"}
{"text":"Ce n'est peut être pas le restaurent le plus beau ou le plus \"in\" de montréal, mais ça reste que c'est la nourriture la plus semblable que celle d'Italie!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. This is a cute little restaurant near st catherine like everyone described. I had no time to research on restaurant because I'm on a business trip this time. We were looking for simple reasonable priced pasta for lunch and just stumbled into here. 
The menu is simple you pick sauce and type of Pasta ( they will advise you if they think it s not a good combo)  I got a cabonara tagliolini, the pasta is a little bit wider than normal, but it's so fresh, and cooked to perfect! My friend got mixed mushroom sauce with tagliolini , and it's just as delicious. 
We were too hungry and totally forgot to take picture. But if you go to urbanspoon or tripadvisor, there are a lot of reviews and a few pictures.

Conclusion: highly recommended and I'll definitely go back to this restaurant when I go to Montreal the next time."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food, reasonable prices for Montreal. I ordered the risotto from the prix fixe menu and was not disappointed. My husband ordered the chicken scallopini and it was amazing. My daughter ordered the tortellini with butter and cheese, and the helpful waiter suggested a half portion. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Very fresh pasta. Food was upscale. he tiramisu was to die for.

The waitress was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was trying to plan a lovely birthday dinner for my mother and had researched this restaurant online, it seemed nice. We walked in during the Grand Prix madness, and though the initial waitress was nice, our following waiter was absolutely horrible. Worst service ever. He came over and was rude and unfriendly. Firstly, I had to go to him to just get water for our table of four, because he was ignoring our table. When he finally came over with the water, he made a rude comment saying \"I thought you guys would be ready to order considering you were so desperate to talk to me\" when we started to ask questions about the menu. He was making overall sarcastic and discourteous comments and was unaccommodating in changing the order slightly to better fit our needs. We ended up leaving the restaurant without eating because of how rude the waiter was. Also, the menu was nothing like what was online (much more limited). Would not go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pleasantly quiet on a Friday night, with a calm, laidback, unpretentious vibe. The two waitresses were very friendly and provided great service, not worrying about whose table was whose. The bread was delicious, the ravioli arrabiata was very flavourful, but perhaps just under cooked (but better than over cooked!). The highlight was the crème caramel!

The prices were reasonable and it felt very authentic."}
{"text":"This was my first visit with a friend on a Thursday night...

This place was really packed (so it was a good sign).  The server came to us right away.  We were seated after a few minutes of waiting.

My friend told me that this place does every thing well with a small menu - I agree with this statement.  First, the wine list is small - I tried a Toscan Chardonnay wine before the meal and it was an excellent dry wine  My friend's feedback on the red wine was also very positive.

I started with the green salad and it was fresh and the portion was generous.  I tried the braised rabbit as the main meal and I was very happy with this choice.  It was tender with a very flavourful sauce.  The desert of my choice was a tiramisu and it was fresh and quite original.

The noise level of the place was the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating: it was somewhat distracting to hear the conversations around you.  The tables were set up very close to each other.

I will visit again."}
{"text":"Un super bon restaurant italien de Montréal plus ou moins d'ambiance mais les plats sont super et on retrouve des pizzas comme à Napoli."}
{"text":"I was there for a quick lunch so this won't be the most comprehensive review.
The bread was very sliced baguette  good with both butter and their house brand basil infused olive oil as options.

I had a spaghetti with red a light red sauce and sautéed zucchini, onion, mushrooms and bell peppers. It had great spices and flavor.

Service was friendly and prompt.

They also have a lunch special with appetizer, pasta of the day and coffee and optional desert ($4 extra) for $15 which a co-worker had and liked but I didn't order because of time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once was four months ago, the other two years ago, so I don't remember a lot. I'll do my best.

I was very pleased with my food on both occasions. On both occasions, I was just visiting Montreal, but my uncle lives in Montreal, and this restaurant is one of his favorites. 

I remember this summer enjoying the lasagna, and my partner got rabbit in a white wine sauce. He and I had never had rabbit before, and we both liked the dish.

I hate coffee, but I remember they're tiramisu is -phenomenal-. They actually have ladyfingers soaked in espresso, so I only ate the top half of my piece, but it was excellent.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, and there is a very tiny and nice patio out back."}
{"text":"The café was located in a beautiful location and had a wonderful outdoor patio. The wine was tasty. However the menu is very limited with the amount of choices that were available. Service was mediocre. The salmon was delicious. However the two sides next to it we're not that good.The coffee was substandard. Prices are on the high side."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for homemade pasta and great veal. The tiramisu is likely the best in town. Like the overall vibe."}
{"text":"We went to Restaurant Ferrari on a Tuesday night around 7pm. Thinking an fresh pasta Italian restaurant would be busy for a 7pm reservation was wrong. This place was pretty dead. As the other reviews note, there really is one server, the owner and then the chef. 

Despite the lack of life in the restaurant, the food was great. We tried their special mozzarella di bufala with tomatoes and pesto. It was scrumptious. I had the create your own pasta dish - paparadelle with a oil based mushroom sauce which was delicious. 

The owner insisted that we try the tiramisu, and it really did complete our meal. They must make it there fresh every day because the consistency was so perfect. 

We also watched the owner interview a young lady to be a waitress, so hope that helps this place out a bit!"}
{"text":"small and intimate. amazing food and two of the sweetest waitresses I've ever had the pleasure of being served by.  the \"boss\" was there that night and he was awesome as well.   if I could give more than 5 stars I would"}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch with the mother of the spouse of a good friend of mine and her daughter as they had proclaimed that this was one of their \"go-to\" restaurants in Montreal. I can see why. It's a cutesy little trattoria that serves light Italian fare with some great pizza. I had a simple spaghetti with meat sauce and a salad to be followed by a dessert of apple pie. The pasta is made from scratch and was quite wholesome. Service was also good if a little too attentive at times. I'd come back, but since the place is small, I might advise against coming with too many people!"}
{"text":"Pros:
-The food is reasonably priced.

Cons: 
-Seems like the whole menu is in French 
-the menu itself looks uninspired in appearance
-The english language skills of the waiters here is limited.

It's an ok italian restaurant, nothing to write home about honestly."}
{"text":"First night back in Montreal in something like 10 years. I felt like skipping the crowds at the bars and breweries, and opted instead for \"Ferrari\" , with its offer of Italian comfort food and cozy looking patio it seemed like a good bet.  

When I walked inside to be seated I noticed there was basically one server working the entire place,  an animated gentleman who told me he would be with me shortly.  He wasn't.  Instead, an older fellow ushered me outside and slammed a menu and glass of water down before promptly leaving without a word. 

Fair enough, I thought.  I'll wait for the server.  And so I waited.

And Waited.

And Waited.

About 15 minutes later, with no sign of the server I got up and walked inside to ask what was up.  The server finally noticed me, and sprang into action, apologizing and rushing outside with me to where I had been sitting. 

He gave me a wine menu and took my order -  the \"Ferrari\" pizza,  which ( in my limited understanding of the French language) appeared to be topped with a combination of sausage and black olives.  I also asked for a glass of Chianti.  He acknowledged both orders enthusiastically and then, in a flash, was gone again. 

Another ten minutes passed, and I was curious what had become of my wine.  I turned to look inside the restaurant and noticed that he was uncorking a bottle.  He proceeded to pour a glass, and then he took what looked like his thumb and index finger and grasped around in the glass as if he was trying to fish something out. 

By the time the wine arrived I was a little skeptical of whether or not I wanted to drink it. I settled on \"No, I don't\".  But before I could ask him about the finger fishing, he had turned and left again. Now, it's important to remember that at this point it's about 8:45 and the restaurant is mostly empty, with the exception of one group inside and a lone gentlemen seated on the patio with me.  I can appreciate that he was working multiple tables,  but It was obvious that I was playing second (or third) fiddle to the other diners.  

The Pizza finally arrives.  I take a bite.  Not good.   It's greasy, and flavorless.  It's also incredibly small, Four slices for 15 dollars.  A single olive on each slice.  Worth a 30 + minute wait ?  Hell no. 

My absentee server returns, finally noticing that I haven't taken a single sip of my wine.  He asks why and I tell him point blank it is because I saw him violate it with his fingers.  He seems quite surprised by this, and attempts to explain that he was removing bits of cork for me.  I tell him that I don't care about cork in my wine , but I do care about his fingers. After a moment or two of awkward silence and pained facial expressions he apologizes and offers to take it off the bill. 

I pay the bill,  and leave.  

Never to return again.   And neither should you."}
{"text":"I think this place is underrated. Their pastas are very good and priced very attractively. Not a fancy meal by ANY stretch of the imagination. But a perfectly satisfactory after work, non-work meal. Venue less than ideal in terms of niceness though. An update there would probably increase their mojo. As it stands, if you mainly care about food, Ferrari is kondo bs of like an undervalued asset. Why not buy?"}
