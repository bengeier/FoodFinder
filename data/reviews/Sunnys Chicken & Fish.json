{"text":"Very long wait. Once I got my food the fries and fish were overcooked, cold and underseasoned."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've ever had, love the texture, the flavors, and the crisp to your food and fries. Waiting line can be a bit long sometimes other than that it's great."}
{"text":"Great chicken and fish! Love coming here when im in town. Their Lemon Pepper and Hot wings are my favorite. Its all cooked to order and they even have chicken livers and gizzards."}
{"text":"This was the best fried chicken I have had in Las Vegas In a while. I must say it is affordable and good. The menu is easy but it takes a while for the chicken.   My dad and daughter tried the catfish which was also delish,crispy, well flavored and perfect (but it only comes with one tarter sauce).  Well worth the wait and the drive."}
{"text":"Great prices, tasty food ... chili cheese fries and wings good"}
{"text":"Great food!!.. drive past here all the time, decided to stop in tonight, definitely a funky little dive spot, but the beer battered fish and fries were amazing... crispy yet not greasy... fish was so flaky and the portion size was great, and it was about $6.. Will definitely be our go-to spot for take out fish"}
{"text":"Tried their wings and fries and they are amazing!!!! Really affordable!!! 6 wings with fries for $4 & some cents! The sucky part was their chili cheese fries :( they were horrible but aside from that the staff is great and good wings"}
{"text":"Great restaurant that not many people know about. Worth the drive. Cool owner with great prices. Can't beat it. As good as roscoes in LA."}
{"text":"This used to be a hole in the wall (literally there was a hole in the wall), with it's new exterior remodeled look... Sunny's Chicken is the place to be!! There's something for everyone here, from poultry, fish, waffles, & more Sunny's never fails to disappoint. My personal go to favorite is their significant Southern style fried fish! The made to order fish inside is delicate, flavorful, fresh & the out side is so crispy I love it! PS: wings, fries & waffles are deluxe too. For you so called wing lovers, come out to Sunny's Chicken & try it for yourselves... I dare you."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a small place but great service and wings. They're prepared fast and a whole container of fries for just a dollar and some change, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Great tasting fish and chicken!!! Excellent flavor!!!  The fish and chicken is the bomb!!! I would highly recommend going there."}
{"text":"The food is good, service not so much. I came in last night. I ordered an 8 piece hot fingers with fries and two two piece plain fingers with fries. When my order was ready the owner's wife only gave me three cups of ranch for 12 fingers total 4 of which they didn't use any of their sauce on. I asked for one more ranch and two barbecues. I was told I have to pay for extra dipping sauces. After some bickering I finally received the sauces and drove home. When I arrived home I discovered my 8 piece hot was missing 2 fingers. I drove back to Sunny's and informed them of what happened. This time Sunny looked at me like I ate two of the fingers before my return. I asked could I get some type of compensation for having to take my time to return because of their mistake. He told me I could get two more fingers or my money back. He made a point to let me know I was not gonna take advantage of him. I thought that was unprofessional. They took advantage of me when they shorted me two fingers."}
{"text":"If you have a sign that states you have the best chicken wings in town. I gotta give you a shot. Half order of plain and the other half Garlic Parmesan. Plain tasted like really plain. Salt and pepper and thrown in the deep fryer. The garlic parmesan ones were much better. They have about 20 different sauces to choose from. The chicken and waffles were excellent. Chicken breast was moist and juicy in the inside and crispy on the outside. Waffle was a bit soggy but that was my fault, 15 minute ride home. Still in search of the perfect chicken wing."}
{"text":"If you looking for a hole in the wall chicken spot that has BOMB food, well look no further. I ran into this place on the way home from a long Vegas weeked. My fiance's friend lives in the area and I need some food before we made the long   trek home to Cali. I was not dissapointed places like this are not know for their decor or ambiance but for the good food. Dont be fooled Sunny knows how to fry some chicken. I was munching on wings the whole ride home."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible all around.   We first tried to call to place an order and no one picks up their phone. We decided to just drive there and ended up waiting well over an hour for an order of 10 chicken wings and a waffle, which was twice the time we were quoted. Greasy and dirty place with zero customer service, and every area had grease or trash on it. Every employee was also remarkably unfriendly. Prices were good but it was not worthwhile, and the food was dripping with grease (and not in a good way).  Super unpleasant experience. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"So just an update after I tried the fish!  Let me tell you it is DELICIOUS!!!  I don't know what they season this fish with but it's is amazingly good.  And just like the chicken they cook the fish as you order it.  I don't mind the long wait because I know it's going to be worth it.   Yayyy!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb, local gem with great prices and even better food. I always get the lemon pepper and the hot wings. Gotta try the chicken and waffles next !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! All of their food is well seasoned and tastes great! Their chicken and waffles are SOOOO good and I'm a big roscoe chicken & waffles fan. This place gives them a run for their money! Their prices are super affordable which is a huge plus too. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Wings are amazing along with delicious fries! They are very nice.  Generous with ranch which is a plus!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, such a loss that I was recently diagnosed with a Gluten allergy and have to watch what I eat.  But OMG the ladies at my job and I always loved going here to eat. Great catfish and my husband loved the Philly Cheese steak. You can't go wrong ordering from here. The food has always been fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This place was a hole in the wall. There was a foul smell as well. However, the food is made when you order. Parking was available and seating available inside.  Pricing was ok.  Chicken was fresh and very good.  My boyfriend ordered hot wings as well and he stated they were on point!  Will go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Based on all of the rave reviews on their food we had to check them out. So my first impression was I am definitely not coming to this place after dark! The place is a hole in the wall in a not so great area, but let me tell you the food and the prices make you forget all about it once you get your food. We both got the 6 piece wings and fries. My husband tried the ranch and I got the extra mild. Our favorite ones were the ranch. The extra mild were okay, but it seems like they used catchup to tone down the heat and they were still a little spicy. They were not bad just not our favorite. The place stays busy and the phone is always ringing, which tells you how good their food is. The lady that waited on us had no personality and could use some customer service skills. No thank you or anything and we asked her a question and she was about to write down what we were asking about the Lemmon pepper like that's what we Wanted on our chicken. She also gave us bottle soda that we had to go back up to the counter because she didn't open them when she gave them to us."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken, fish , and waffles are cooked and seasoned perfectly. Wait can be long but well worth it for fresh food. Restaurant decor def has seen better days but the food makes up for it. I live in SW so don't get to eat there nearly enough but if I could I'd visit weekly. Try it, you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"The lemon pepper chicken wings were okay, a little over cooked. My husband liked them though. The southern fried fish was good and the chicken and waffles was delicious, I got two thighs. Their fries could be better. Definitely a hole in the wall type of spot with good cheap food. Definitely will go again when in the vicinity. They forgot our tartar sauce for the fish and charge for ranch."}
{"text":"I love this place it's so good and cheap.. we order here at least 3 times a month my favorite flavor for chicken wings is spicy BBQ... next I'm trying the chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"LOVE IT. I mean I know the outside doesn't look like much but it is sooooo worth the trip. The food, portion size, and prices are all top notch."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a whole in the wall ,  but their chicken is worth the 15-20 min wait.  It's cooked after you put your order in and very fresh .  The chicken is white and tender , Very cheap too.  I order the chicken and waffles for 3.99$. Couldn't even finish it that's how large the portion."}
{"text":"Good,fast and cheap only downside is that the place looks abandoned and smells like armpits"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a little hole in the wall joint...but it's a hidden (but not so hidden) gem as well.  Prices are totally fair. The wings are fried and seasoned to perfection!  I like mine crispy and not wet...I don't even have to request special instructions. Their wings are already on point!  The fish is pretty good, satisfies my cravings for sure. Only thing that peeves me about the fish plate...it comes with either hot sauce OR tarter sauce!!!  I NEED BOTH!  So I'm taking my plate home where I can adorn it w hot sauce and tarter sauce and lemon!    I haven't tried anything else in the menu yet...I will one day .   The wing flavors I've tried: Lemon pepper - FAVE Ranch - not bad...not as memorable  Flamin hot - delicious Spicy BBQ - Yumazing"}
{"text":"I mean who isn't attracted to $3.59 Chicken and Waffles?! My BF and I stumbled upon Sunny's on Yelp and (1) ratings were great (2) saw the prices and right away were like \"okay let's go here\"   Though it was 20min from our apt, we were excited for this meal. It isn't in the best part of town (deep east side), and the restaurant isn't one I'd call fancy, but don't let that scare you off!   I took off a star just because the food did take quite a while to get ready. I wanna say we waited about 25-30min for our food.. My BF got the chicken and waffles ($3.59) and I opted for their catfish fish and chips southern style ($5.99). Okay presentation looked great, prices were AMAZING but I guess the food was just good/okay. The chicken was seasoned very well. The waffle was really soft and kinda soggy. We both agreed we like it better crispier like how other place make it since the chicken obviously will make it soggy in the long run. My catfish looked great and came with a lot but they were also thin so it was more of the breading than the meat, which was a little disappointing too. The fries it came with were really soft too. Ehh idk the prices are GREAT like I said, but the food was honestly mediocre and took forever.. May or may not come back since it is quite a drive, but we'll see"}
{"text":"If you want incredibly good, fresh and properly seasoned chicken livers and gizzards you can't go wrong at Sunny's. It's about a 25 minute drive from where we live and the drive was well worth the reward of the very good food. While we didn't eat anything else, I saw orders of fish and fried chicken served and they looked every bit as good as I know ours tasted. The place is small and plain and all the help as well as patrons were friendly. There's nothing fancy about Sunny's...it's all about the food."}
{"text":"Tasty fried chicken. And gizzards. And fries. And waffles.  Everything we've had here was tasty, and cheap too, which is always nice!  Gizzards come a ton to an order, for under $4. BF's a fan, and with the buffalo sauce from the chicken and waffles dish, they're solid: crispy, and served hot. Chicken and waffles are a dish I've never quite understood, but the sweetness of the thick, fluffy waffle plus the syrup contrasted nicely with the hot chicken and buffalo sauce. Would get this again, and it's a steal at $3. Two-piece \"snack\" comes with some deliciously-seasoned fries and a roll. This is a meal even for my unrestrained appetite, not a \"snack\".  All in all, this is a solid place for fried chicken. Service is friendly. Location isn't in the best area and the interior isn't impressive, but the flavors sure are. Wish it wasn't so far of a drive for me."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside or inside appearance of this place scare you away just know that the reason they haven't fixed the atmosphere is they're too busy frying \"bomb ass\" chicken & fish. The food is perfect & reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Really awesome wings. Prefer them over bdubs/wingstop. Their wings are generously sauced and cooked to perfection. Their fries are also really good."}
{"text":"Excellent value!  Excellent fried chicken!  Fat rendered, skin crispy, well seasoned and cooked to order.  Sunny took my order and sold me with his personality.  I ordered the 12 Piece mixed, gizzards and fries for under 21$.  F the colonel, F Popeye.  This is where I buy chicken take out for my family from here on out.  Can't wait to try sunnys breaded wings.  Oh yea! Did I mention how clean his restaurant is?"}
{"text":"Over charged me will not be coming back don't even give receipt gives you a ticket with no price on it for the $5.99 add $1.00 for fries order charged $8.34 but I wanted to still try it. $1.34 taxes come on in the hood you have to be careful...."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Sunnys one day while driving.  Noticed a nice crowd so I decided to try it out.  I was amazed at the prices, asked one guy about it and he said it was the best fried chicken he had ever had.  Well it was good but if that was the best he's ever had, he needs to get out more.  Now don't get me wrong, Sunnys is good, both the chicken and fish were.  I ordered the fish on my first visit, the seasoning they use to coat the fish is very light and well seasoned, plus they give you a lot for 4.99.  On my second visit I tried the chicken, it too was seasoned very well and the price was also excellent.   On my third visit I got lemon pepper wings, they were just a tad bit too salty but still very tasty.  3.99 for six wings and fries!!!  Great value and good food, not the best I've ever had but it's better than most places and is cheaper than just about any place.  I'll be back.    BTW, if you can, call in your order, otherwise the wait may be 30 minutes, the neighborhood is sketchy so  you want to get in and out of there quickly, they close at 10 on the weekends but I wouldn't advise visiting late at night."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough,  found this place accidentally while I was at the car wash across the street. What a bargain, 2 piece Chicken and Waffle 3.50. Gizzards are the bomb also."}
{"text":"Food is very good and the service is good mom And pop we need more food places on the east side Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great new place for fast soul food! Stopped by for the 1st time today and tried a 4 piece mix which came with a leg, thigh, wing and breast. The chicken was juicy and well seasoned but comes out super hot and fresh so be careful so you don't burn yourself! I'm assuming everything is made to order since the food takes a little while but nothing wrong with that! The food here is dirt cheap and my 4 piece was only $4.99! Will have to try the $3.59 chicken and waffles next time!  Not sure what kind of seasoning and hot sauce they use but it's tasty! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Being new to Las Vegas the reviews on this place made me curious. The wings were cooked the way I like it and the seasoning, I think lemon pepper  is reminiscent of a joint I used to frequent in Milwaukee. That seasoning is addictive. So good. The waffles are like tasty pillows of love.  WOW! I also had the fish, again so good and cooked perfectly. I found my new eating heaven when that craving hits."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall that's worth it! Had the wings and southern fried fish. The wings were juicy and the sauce was pretty tastey too. The fish had a good crust on it. Just be ready to wait a while."}
{"text":"This place is slow as hell and so dirty ! I don't care how cheap the food is I have been waiting over 25mins for 6pc chicken ! Won't be back ever ! Even after all that I got my food and my fries were dry and cold ! I have had better wings also !"}
{"text":"Is this the same Sunny's that use to own the corner store on Lake Mead and Englestad? If so I'm gonna hit it up this weekend. I remember the chicken tasting soooo good to be sooo cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing is all I can say! Food quality and price are unbeatable! A must eat place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"So I was just being a douche or something on my last review. I get it, they're super busy and they only have like 3 people working.  I LOVE the chicken here. It's like real home cookin! Roscoe's waffles may be better, but the chicken here blows them out of the water. I don't know how they prepare it or what seasonings they use, but it seriously is perfection. The outside is really crispy and the inside is juicy. I don't care how hungry I was, I'd rather wait hours here than 10 minutes at other chicken joints. Lol."}
{"text":"The food is really good and stupid cheap, we ordered 2 chicken gizzards, 2 two pieces chicken and waffle dinners and 1southern catfish and fries  all for 23 dollars. My only complaint is that the gizzards were a little over cooked but everything was seasoned perfectly. Now the place looks like crap out side but they do have a grade A so I would go back."}
{"text":"So for starters I was shocked walking into the restaurant and seeing who was running it. Second, the food isn't made until you pay for your order so be prepared to wait. Lastly, the food was OK. I ordered 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle. The chicken was really good. The waffle was plain. Overall, it was cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Me and the wifey always drove by this place so we finally decided to check it out on the way home. Every time we drove by we always said the same thing. \"Sunny's Chicken and Fish? Sounds good but the place looks kind of shady\". Well folks, let me be the first one to tell you that it's not shady at all. We stopped by around 6:30 for dinner and never felt any safer. It's really not a shady place.  Now to the important stuff.  All I gotta say is get the Fried Catfish plus the Chicken n Waffles no matter what.   The Catfish ($5.99) has two options. Southern, which is basically cajun, and Beer Battered. Both are very good.  The cajun style has a cornmeal/pepper spice to it while the beer battered option gives you the crispy coating with good flavor. Comes with fries which is also decent. I love both options because when you bite into either one, you can taste the flavor of the catfish and you can tell that it was freshly seasoned or battered right before getting dumped in the fryer. The freshness of the fish is evident in every bite. I know some places you might get that sandy, bottom of the ocean taste but here its non existent.  The Chicken n Waffles ($3.99). OMG. I dont know what it is exactly what it is that coats the chicken but damn, I could eat that by itself. While I was savoring that, I almost forgot that there was a waffle that came with it. By the end of the meal, it didnt matter what I was dipping in the syrup, it all tasted good put together. Oh, you also get some hot sauce too just in case the syrup is not your thing or if its simply not enough.  As for the comments on this place being not too attractive, I compare it to that nice, quiet, nerd type librarian with glasses and the hair tied up. Once you get to know them and they open up to you, they are actually very attractive with their rich personality. You know what they say. It's always the quiet ones that surprise you.   Some random info. They take cards. There's no bathroom. At least there is a nice sink for you to wash your hands with after you are done licking your fingers from all the flavor.  So in closing, always have an open mind in trying things out for the first time especially when something seems sketchy. This place is a diamond in the rough, hole in the wall, etc. Whatever cliche you want, it fits. Will be back with lots of other people. As a matter of fact, I ordered more food to take home to my family and they loved it! Memo to Roscoe. You got some serious competition.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #114 \"Dont waffle on this place!\""}
{"text":"Sunny's Chicken & Fish is Ridiculous. My friend took me here stating it was the best fried chicken in Vegas,\"It reminds me of my mom's chicken... The crispy texture.\" She went on about when you take a bite, the flavor bursts in your mouth.   We are food connoisseurs, to drive out of our way for corn fritters or a great cup of tea is not unheard of.   Upon entering the facility I knew there was some promise since the joint looked like everything a \"the best\" fried chicken shack should be... a shack.  Nothing pretentious.   The service was excellent, especially considering how busy he was. You are what you eat, and food served with a positive attitude is better for consumption.  I ordered the chicken and waffle. The waffle had a touch of cinnamon in the batter which gave it a little flair. The chicken was exactly how my friend described, crispy- juicy- full of flavor = Well worth the visit.   REASONS TO VISIT SUNNY'S CHICKEN & FISH:  1. Parking Lot 2. A Health Department Rating  3. Friendly Service 4. Great Chicken 5. Reasonable Prices"}
{"text":"If that Triple D guy ever wanted to showcase real dives instead of the faux, he could start at Sunny's Chicken & Fish way out here on the east side of town.  There's really no way to get around it: this place looks rough.  Funky with a capital F.  Peeled wallpaper, old fixtures, archaic menu board, flies.  None of that stuff really matters.  You don't come here for the ambiance. You come here for the food.  It's the  Flavortown Paradox.  The Flavortown Paradox describes the inverse relationship between a dive's appearance and the tastiness of its food.  That's this place in Spades.    The chicken is cooked to order and served up blistering hot. Mine was cooked perfectly. My only criticism was it was a little too salty.  Delicious, but salty. My two piece combo (breast/wing) was quite filling. The waffle was good, but not really remarkable.  The Waffle/2 piece fried chicken combo is a real bargain at $3.59.    Mikey C says: out here on the perimeter we are stoned immaculate."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Good chicken and waffles! I tried the gizzards they were delicious! Not the fanciest but the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings are AMAZING, I didn't think they would be that good, but wow, was I wrong . Unfortunately I take 1 star off because it's not a very friendly place to eat at , so I always take it to go"}
{"text":"CHICKEN AND FISH IS IN THE TITLE, YOU GOT ME THE DOOR WITH THAT ALONE! Sunny in the back cooking my chicken, a second plus. Albertson's potato salad, ok there's your first negative. What else you got?  So a good friend and foodie told me and my boyfriend about a new east side spot that has chicken and waffles. He really didn't need to say more, we were in.  Then I seen a 2pc chicken and waffle for under $4. WHAT IS THE CATCH? Sunny's is a cool addition to the east side with some solid fried chicken. I think there are still pretty new and have potential to be way more than what they are now. The sides like cole slaw, beans, and potato salad are store bought. But the batter on the chicken makes up for it. The waffle was decent as well. The hot sauce, not spicy. My biggest complaint is the décor and smell. I know you are a new place but clean it up a bit. It smelled like urine or cleaning supplies trying to cover up a bad smell.  I agree with all the other reviews, room for improvement, great value, decent food, and I am excited to see what's to come."}
{"text":"Ordered 15 flammin hot, 5 lemon pepper, 10 mild, 10 garlic parm, and chilli cheese fries. Chicken and all flavors were delicious and cooked fresh. Call ahead if you can. The chilli cheese fries were ok, I would order again but reminded me of 711 chilli n cheese. Great for the buck though."}
{"text":"Omg at least 3times a week we been coming here I love fried chicken and waffles  Im a cali girl so roscoes is my fav but I aint gonna lie I been getting six piece mild wings with fries not even 4$ and is the shit"}
{"text":"Best price chicken and waffles! \"Taste so good make you wanna slap yo mama!!\" But for real it's soo good, best chic n waffles in Vegas! Chicken so juicy and crispy! And that waffle batter mmmmmm. Not in nicest location, but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Man I been fucking with Sunny's, since its was in the westside. (Lakemead &d street) this one is good as well tho. It's just a little bit further out the eau, but shit 6pc hot with fries for 3.99 you can't beat that."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I ordered the southern catfish and chicken fingers. It taste homemade and the prices are relatively cheap. Good deal for some catfish. They give you a lot for your money too."}
{"text":"2 pc snack breast and wing is jeopardizing my marriage.  My husband and kids love it here. So juicy, crispy,  cooked to perfection. Sunny is still in business for a reason. He knows what he is doing!"}

{"text":"The food here is always amazing. I'm a huge fan of the crispy 10 piece wings \"ranch and spicy bbq flavored.\""}
{"text":"Great food.  Cooked to order so don't be in a rush. Best advice, call ahead and order and plan on at least a 30 min wait. A great deal for the price. Friendly folks and really a local place.  They have their regulars and it was great to hear the banter back and forth.  It is the best friend chicken and where else can you get liver and gizzards?"}
{"text":"Sucked into another seemingly positive Yelp review... From the beginning... The place only had 2 others here when I arrived. All of the tables were dirty and the windows were filthy with lots of scratches. In one corner was a pile of broken tables stacked high with some sort of strange hand written note on the pile. I wanted to try both the chicken and fish and chips and asked if I could purchase 1 piece of fish to sample... No. I later found out that the fish was catfish, so I am glad that was the answer. I ordered a 3 pc chicken snack with 2 drumsticks and a wing. It took well over 25 minutes to get it. Again this was at 2:15 on a Saturday with nearly no one in the place. One good point was the chicken and fries came out hot. The roll was cold and hard. The \"drumsticks\" we're the the size of seagull legs. The wing was normal sized. The coating on the chicken was course and really had no flavor to it, the chicken was not marinated either... Pretty bland. The counter person was friendly.... That's all I got!!"}
{"text":"My favorite local wing spot, I always get lemon pepper chicken wings. I've even had their gizzards and was not disappointed. This place is definitely a must try, you'll love it. Always order to go, and call ahead. The staff is friendly and they are always busy. They are cheaper and definitely taste better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Wing Stop hands down. Whenever anyone mention wings I tell them about Sunny's."}
{"text":"Good cheap meals only giving 3 stars due to they tell you your food is going to take a certain amount of minute but your always waiting longer then what they say they never answer the phone or simply ignore the phone other then that food is good well the chicken wings that's all I ever get anyway food is always made fresh and hot"}
{"text":"First time here after my daughter, who has been here in the past, wanted some chicken and waffles.  I read other reviews about this place before driving over.  It is a hole in the wall place.  Once the order was placed it took 30 minutes before it was ready.  They take a lot of call in orders so many people were coming in to pick up their food.  Others have complained that no one answers the phone.  Twice the phone rang off the hook when the order taker went in the back.  The phone ring is not very loud so she most likely can't hear it in the back.  The food looked and smelled great.  Since it was not ordered for me I can't review its taste. The price was good for the amount of food ordered.  I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here after reading a couple of reviews raving about their fried chicken. Drove over 45 minutes just to get here. Yes, I had a mega urge for fried chicken that day.  I had known by reading the reviews that there's at least 20 minutes wait for their fried chicken. I was too lazy and stupid to call in before so I ended up waiting over 30 minutes in this unairconditioned tiny store for my fried chicken, gizzards and liver. (There are some sealing fans so wasn't that bad.) The guy that took my order was very nice. He warned me there was going to be 20 to 30 minutes wait. (Yeah, I know. My bad.) When my food came out, I was so exited I had to taste a few pieces of gizzards and liver before I headed back to home. Mmmm, they were so good!! They were coated with some kind of peppery tasty seasoning. They were deep fried but it didn't taste greasy at all. I especially loved their gizzards. They were so addicting I finished the whole container off. (I couldn't eat anything for 24 hours after this.) Can't believe they are only $3.29 each family size. The fried chicken was also very tasty. It had different coating than gizzards' and liver's. It was worth the wait and the long drive. Definitely hit the spot. Thanks to the Yelpers for great reviews :-) Great fried chicken shack in the hood. I will stop by here again if I'm in the neighborhood but I would not come here myself at night. Next to a liquor store."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(95/100) \"Iraqi Style With A Bit Of Soul\"  With the sad closing of Kathy's(AGAIN!) It left a huge hole in my fried chicken heart...:( I saw pictures from Ty W. and immediately bookmarked this place. Not in the nicest part of town, but some pretty tasty bites can be found here!  Sunny and his wife are an Iraqi couple busting out their version of Soul Food in the Sunrise area of Las Vegas, and seems like they're doing pretty well. We were jonezing for some fried chicken, so I went straight for the 2-piece Chicken and Waffles($3.59),  Wifey Got the 2-piece snack($3.99) which comes with a roll and fries. We also spied some fried chicken livers($3.29) so we tried those as well.  We didn't try any sides, but judging from Dyanna L.'s Review, I don't think their sides are made in house. The chicken and livers are pretty tasty and the waffle is made fresh(Syrup is standard Log Cabin , HFC stuff), so those are pretty solid selections if you do decide to give Sunny's a go. The seasoning on the chicken(same on the fries too, I think) may throw people off, and times be a little salty, and the bare bones place could use a solid cleaning, but people keep coming in and getting wings and chicken by the container full to go, and the price point here is not bad at all.   In the meantime in between time, I'll keep searching, maybe return for some wings or gizzards!...:9  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu  3.75  *Good service, tasty birds, and prices are a steal, but place could be cleaner..."}
{"text":"I ordered the beer battered catfish, lemon pepper chicken wings and four piece chicken. I was not too pleased with the food, it didn't have any taste whatsoever. The prices are good but I guess you get what you pay for because the quality was not there."}
{"text":"The food is great  very good wings. Fish. Fingers  great service  great prices. The moms and pops place.  Have everyone beat.   Wing stop can't compare. Sorry !"}
{"text":"My daughter took me their for the first time about 3 weeks ago and I fell in love, the food is very good, seasoned just right, 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall type of place. I usually say that if there's a crowd or busy the establishment is doing something right. That's not the case for sunnys chicken and fish, the food speaks for itself. Think twice before judging a place like this.  Service is great but don't expect \"fine dining\" great. Did I mention how good the food is? They're  cooked to order so I wouldn't expect a quick service as well. If you want quick service go to a drive through.  The chicken was hot, moist, crispy and perfectly seasoned. I have had other chicken and waffles from other places and this place just hits the spot all the time."}
{"text":"So we moved int the area recently and needed to discover some good food in the area. Now I've lived in Vegas all my life and have passed sunnys a lot in my time here. When I first saw the  place I made a mental note to maybe not go here. Yes the place looks tore up and like a hole in the wall. But we looked at reviews for restaurants in the area and sunnys had good reviews so we tried it. We walked in the first time and they were busy. Like really busy. We waited for almost a hour for our food. But it was good. The prices had me worried too. Fries and 6 piece $4. Yea right. But this place truly lives up to the hype. Only suggestion I have is call on your order so you're not waiting there. But that's another thing you know your food is made to order because you did have to wait. But we call it in every time and then head out to pick up.  We eat here like once a week now. Don't let the look of this place fool you like I let it fool me for so long. Also they have an A grade with the health department that they got just earlier this month"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered tasted great! Food took a little long to prepare.. So if you're in a hurry go some where else. Owner was so friendly and helpful in explaining everything on the menu. We took everything to go so we didn't have to dine in. Place looked a little grungy.. Food was very inexpensive though! Yum!"}
{"text":"Although the service is extremely slow the prices very affordable and the food is delicious service is amazing AC could definitely be updated I've been going here for 2 to 3 years and haven't gotten one bit of Breeze due to the lack of AC other than that solid C rating"}
{"text":"The owners are good people, friendly, and is able to run a clean restaurant around the area of Washington and Lamb.  I'm comfortable with the area but some people might not be.  I always get it to go though because I usually always almost only come here while I'm at work.  But the food here is super cheap.  The hot sauce they use is Frank's RedHot sauce.  I like the fried chicken, waffles, and catfish.  The deep fried items come out super hot, meaning it's made to order and served immediately.  They can be busy at times and backed up as long as 30+ mins so I always order 30 mins ahead over the phone and pick it up to go or eat there.  Chicken and waffles in Vegas, not my favorite in Vegas but come get some for the cheap."}
{"text":"I had some left over fried gizzards from my best friend awhile back and I thought they were delicious. When I found out they were from Sunny's, a place I book marked awhile back, I knew I'd found a must try hole in the wall.  I've been craving soul food for weeks and decided to try Sunny's out. To my disappointment I wouldn't call Sunny's soul food. I guess I don't know what soul food is, but I imagined some smothered in gravy fried chicken with some heart sides like macaroni and cheese.  This place is a total hole in the wall when you walk in. Located on Lamb and Washington it is exactly what you'd expect to find inside and out. That's my nice way of saying it wasn't so nice looking. I'm from the east side so this is in my neck of the wood and doesn't scare me, but I can see how some may be put off or scared. First impressions aside I thought they served some delicious eats.  It's all about the deep fried here at Sunny's: beer battered fish, southern fried fish, chicken wings, chicken fingers, and fried chicken. Although they offer many sides like Cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and french fries it is pretty obvious the suggested side is a waffle for most of the dishes with some syrup and hot sauce.   My to-go order included: a huge order of fried gizzards, cole-slaw, 20 wings (garlic parm and hot), a Philly cheesesteak, 2 piece chicken with waffle, 2 piece tenders with waffle. Basically everything but the fish. I spent about $30 and it was a lot of food. A lot a lot of food! The order came out quickly and the cashiers showed us every box to make sure our order was right.  Conclusion is their fried stuff is really good and I wish I ate their to experience the food fresh. I never had chicken and waffles but I now understand America's obsession with it. I was surprised at their wings. They were really good and a good size. For about $12 for 20 I thought they'd be tiny wings. Also everything is super affordable. Getting 2 tenders or two pieces of chicken with a waffle is about $4 and looks to be a filling meal. The batter they use to fry their food is really well seasoned. I wouldn't recommend the Philly cheese steak though. It was greasy in the worst way possible. The meat, onions, peppers, and cheese were all just a mush in the bread.  I can't say much about customer service although the cashier/sunny was nice. I did like that he opened the boxes with me to make sure my order was right. I can definitely see myself coming back here for to go orders when I'm craving some fried chicken."}
{"text":"I tried the wings and the chili cheese . They were both NOT good. The chili on the  were runny. It looked like someone threw up on them. The  wings didn't have the right wing sauce. It had seeds and it was too thin. The sauce is suppose to be a bit thick with the wings drenched with wing sauce. I give it 1/2 a"}
{"text":"I finally got an order! Lolbs... I say that because I had tried several times to come here, but they were closed whenever I'd think of them or they don't answer their phones when I've called to expedite service. So I hopped in the car & drove on over alone. Coming from North Las Vegas down Lamb to this side of town is a drastic change in environment. For Chicago people let me describe this as coming from Oak Brook to the worst Chicago project ever. I saw drug transactions, several prostitutes w/ass hanging out their dresses. It was a very LIT environment.  I'm from the hood, never above the hood, but just be aware!  The environment clearly doesn't deter patrons, at 130ish the place was still jumping with new and old customers. I browsed the menu and decided on 20pc wing lemon pepper & flaming hot, 2pc chicken snack, & a side order of gizzards. YES, IT WAS ALL MINE! Hell I wanted to try it all just in case I never come back, lol. After a 20min wait my order was ready, the lady shows you your order to confirm accuracy, so when looking at mine I don't see my flaming hot wings. I don't recall if she rang them up or not and after the hunger pains & long ass wait I don't inquire I grab my shit & go!   Driving back down Lamb I'm eating omw too and I started w/the gizzards. Very fresh & hot! I didn't like the seasoning they added to them. I would've preferred none or lemon pepper, so those got disgarded quickly. Next I hit the lemon pepper wings FRIED TOO HARD! Taste was very good, but they should've been pulled up sooner. I saved the last 2pc chicken snack which was a thigh & leg for last. It was extra fresh & juicy, but again that seasoning from the gizzards was present. It's like a chipotle seasoning that's gross to me. So I ate the thigh, but nothing else. I left the rest for my kids who didn't eat any of it. Lol I would return for the flavored wings only. I almost forgot to write this review, which isn't good. Service was ok, quick in and out nothing major stood out."}
{"text":"I wanted to try somewhere new, but I also wanted to get some decent protein in after a ridiculous leg workout. Sunny's Chicken and Fish sounded like it might do the trick.  Located a few minutes off the 515 in perhaps one of the less reputable parts of town, Sunny's serves a lot of the kinds of fried goods that you might expect at this part of town: fried chicken, chicken wings from six (with fries) to 100 per order, chicken fingers, cheesesteaks, fish, fries, and a few sides. On the sides menu, however, are gizzards and livers. Definitely not typical, but definitely the reason that I went.  When I asked for gizzards and livers, Sunny asked me if I wanted them mixed together, aka in one order. I was surprised but very happy, especially when I saw that the half-and-half order still cost $3.29 and still was a huge portion. Both of these organ meats are lightly battered and fried with salt, pepper, and likely some other pieces lending a great crunchy exterior. Inside, the gizzards are delightfully chewy, whereas the livers are squishy and very gamy. Don't order livers on your own if you don't know what you're getting into!  My other order was chicken and waffles. Not sure if $3.99 was the right charge since most say it's $3.59, but I won't quibble over a few dimes. You can have two pieces of any typical fried chicken pieces for this order. I chose dark meat (leg and thigh). I actually thought this chicken had a little less flavor in the batter than in my side orders, but it was piping hot, juicy and made-to-order. Hey, it'd better be fresh after I waited at least 15 minutes (possible explanation later).  The waffle was soft and not crunchy at all even though I dined in. The syrup was standard stuff (get extra, you'll need it), but the hot sauce was way too acidic for my taste. Overall, definitely not my favorite rendition of chicken and waffles, although certainly reasonable for the price.  Speaking of which, prices appear to be mostly if not all identical to photos taken close to when they first opened. They don't offer burgers anymore. I suggest calling ahead (as many others observably did) to minimize wait time.  I would try different entrees before going back to the chicken and waffles, but I've still giving Sunny's a solid 4 stars because of the good value (do the math on some of the portions though) and because the offal is anything but awful."}
{"text":"This is a pretty straight forward Chicken and Waffles place. I spent about $5.00 for a two peice chicken and waffle meal with a can of soda and can honestly say I left satisfied with the flavor and the price! Next time I go back I am going to try the hot wings."}
{"text":"Honestly I am addicted to the wings here and the wings prices. I can get twenty wings with a large order of fries for like under 15.00 bucks. They have lots of flavors to choose from for your wings too and they sell battered fish and I have not tried it yet but I'll be sure to post"}
{"text":"First time here, so-so experience.  I haven't tried their chicken yet.  I had the southern fried fish, with an order of gizzards and a side of coleslaw.  I liked the slaw; the fish was okay; an order of gizzards is a lot (a square takeaout tray full), tasted good, but they were overcooked. Fries that came with the fish were just okay."}
{"text":"Yummy! Fried chick is soo good. They were out of chicken livers tho. The wait did take a while but it is fresh and hot when its ready"}
{"text":"I LOVE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES... and this is the best I've ever tasted so far. Yes the place looks unappealing but I'm not there for the decor.. I'm there for the good food! I  read some positive reviews and decided to give this place a try. BEST DECISION EVER. What's crazy is how affordable it is. Chicken and waffles after tax was about 4 bucks. GREAT PORTIONS and a Good deal. The owner is very friendly. He looks like he works very hard and put lots of effort into his food. A tip I would give to other foodies is to TIP the man! The food prices is a steal, literally.  It's hard to come by good food like this, made fresh for that cheap of a price. So spare some dollars and change for his hard work!"}
{"text":"Review of the joint/hole in the wall:  This place is packed but the great thing is that while you wait, and yes you will wait, people come and go so you can find a seat in the 6 bench style tables they have.    Although this is a 5-6 mile off the strip location you need to give it a try.   It's really cheap and the portions are large as long you know what to order.    The wings are small so what you want is the fried chicken.   I started by ordering the pulled chicken and waffle for 3.99 and additionally I wanted to grab a 2pc fried chicken snack which comes with fries.   Go with the fried chicken as those are good portion sizes.   They only con here is the 15-20 min wait, I actually waited longer.  Be patient and if you ask them to check on your order all they say is 4 minutes longer.   You always have the ability to order ahead and they don't seem to have it together.  My review is strictly on the quality of the food and it's ALL GOOD.   Please improve the service if possible. They are very friendly but it seems a lot of people are frustrated although they give you a number when you order.     Review of the food: Pulled chicken and waffle was bomb.  Sooo good I inhaled it.  I'm very happy I drove 5 miles for a 3.99 piece of paradise.    2pc fried chicken snack was some of the best fried chicken I've had.   The seasoning is super tasty and the tenderness of the chicken inside will be a revelation in of itself.  If you could eat bones you just might.  The bun is very tasty and it is not buttery so maybe you can ask for some of you need that butta face.   The fries are legit but I was all too full to give it my best and try to finish.  I just nibbled on a few and they are definitely fries that you will enjoy that are not so salty.    The owners are middle eastern and very nice so say hi to them.    Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... it looks like a hole in the wall, but we all know those type of places have really good food.   On my first time visit, I almost ordered the whole menu since the prices were so great!  Heres what we ordered....  Chicken and waffles : BOMB.COM! Waffle was fluffy and chicken was cooked to perfection. You get 2 big pieces of chicken and the waffle is also generously big. Definitely worth $4 .  Southern fried catfish : This was fried to perfection. The seasoning was on point!  If you like catfish, you must  try.    Fried Gizzards/Liver : You can't find food like this really anywhere, so it's hard to compare it. They were crispy but could use a little more seasoning. They give you a large portion for a low price.  Still good though.  Lemon pepper wings : Amazing! Fried to the perfect crisp and the seasoning was so good. Dip it with the hot sauce and it tasted even better!  I will definetley come back. Just a tip though... they get really busy during lunch, so you would want to phone in your order and pick it up if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"What they do, they do well. I ordered two southern fried fish, a chicken and waffle meal and six piece wings. the meals besides chicken and waffle come with fries. I wish I would of taken a picture of the menu board. It wasn't too complicated. i recall the sides consisted of cole slaw, some type of baked bean, fries and chili?? I was looking for paper menus but there were none.  I highly suggest for the owner to just print out the menu on paper and tri-fold it for return customers.    The fish was really good and well fried AND they give you a lot. Hubs and daughter liked the chicken and said it was well seasoned. i'm saving the wings for lunch tomorrow. I tasted one and it's good too. Quite honestly, I thought the food pricing was super cheap. The paranoia in me wondered, \"is this really fish and where did they get them chickens?\" But mind you the price point where this restaurant is located is probably suitable for the neighborhood. I got four meals for $21. How could I not give a 25% tip?  This restaurant is a hole in the wall. The employees are attentive and friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had. A bit of a wait time but because its made to order so its definitely worth it. $4 got me a box stuffed with fries, a bun, a full wing and a thigh. Great value and fantastic chicken. service was also very friendly."}
{"text":"great food reminds me of a few los angeles spots  just answer the damn phone sometimes nobody wants to order and sit in a crowded ass parking lot (food for thought lol  )"}
{"text":"Long wait, but its worth it. Wouln't go anywhere else but here. It cheap and I dont know whats in the sauce, but I am addicted."}
{"text":"Good people, Good food!. Small restaurant...Big taste. Respectably speaking..... don't knock it until  you try it."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a minute & finally strolled in today. We ordered chicken & waffles, gizzards & fish. Chicken & Waffles gets a 5/5! Very good for a while in the wall AND reasonably priced. Everything is cooked to order so it's fresh & piping hot which I always appreciate while dining out. Our food took about 15-20 minutes to come out on an early Sunday afternoon during a holiday weekend. The gizzards get a 4/5.. very good seasoning.. a little tough but for $3.29 for a huge portion. I'm not complaining. Fish 2/5. It looks good but taste wasn't memorable. A little dry & the type of fish is unspecified. I hope that no one is missing a fish out of their pond or aquarium!! LOL! Fish was dry and didn't have good flavor. I'd recommend Mario's West Side Market for fried fish if you're on this side of town.  All in all.. A good experience for what it was. Don't expect a whole lot from interior if you plan to eat here, but you'll pay a minimal amount for some pretty damned good food! I'd recommend & will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I cant say enough about Sunnys Chicken.  I'm HUGE on CUSTOMER SERVICE & iPromise Sunnys has SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE & food.  Sure the wait is long, but the food is cooked to order...the prices are BEYOND RESONABLE. If you're ever over East check them out... iPromise you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time going, the lack of people made me paranoid that the food wouldn't be hot, but that certainly wasn't the case. I ordered the 20 pc. nuggets; the food I ordered was hot, delicious, and very filling. The setting isn't nice aesthetic but the food is worth it. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings  not only hot as hell  but the skin is still nice and crispy inside"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb and underrated ! The lemon pepper wings are to die for !! yummmm! i would suggest ordering it by phone. it takes a while if you order it there. (:"}
{"text":"very cheap and very good chicken wings !  will be  coming here  more often . loved the fries also but they had a lil to much salt"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken. Excellent price. Nothing pretty just good food. I wish they had some more sides but the chicken is right on."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted anything he food yet but how do you deny something lemon pepper on their chicken? Like if I don't want the hot sauce and syrup like what's it gonna take out of you to sprinkle my chicken with lemon pepper!? Horrible customer service and sense that old lady has none!"}
{"text":"Room For Improvement  Went to Sunny's Chicken and Fish Tuesday for a late lunch hoping service would be fast enough for me to catch the begin of the second half of Chelsea and West Bromich.  I was so hungry for a big lunch and something with some spices, the Pulled Chicken and Waffles with Honey BBQ wonderful the Waffle was satisfactory and and the pulled chicken was white meat chopped up.    Wonderful idea for a restaurant being dead center of Lamb from Charleston and Sahara and the menu is very apropos for the community and with a menu that gives the chef Sunny a chance to more than satisfy the choosiest com-padre."}
{"text":"best chicken in Vegas for the price, cant beat 2 piece and fries for 4 bucks..just get it to go, the wait can be long..cooked to order"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall establishment furniture in need of attention and someone tried to make Sunny's into a drive thru at one time or another.  Don't let the decor and atmosphere deter you thou.  The reason we are here is the food!.  I ordered the 10 piece chicken wings and fries.  Everything is made to order the wings were cooked and sauced perfectly.  Prices are great for what you get.    Instead of paying $1 for a 12 oz soda pay $2.50 and get the 2 liter bottle. :)  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to Yelp! My husband and I wanted to go to a place with my Dad and it needed to be on his side of town. When I read the reviews, I knew we would love this place and I was right!  I ordered the Southern Fish with fries and Joel ordered the Chicken and Waffles. We both shared some chili cheese fries as well. The prices are great. For both of us, with drinks, it came out to under $20. My Dad ordered the same as me and spent under $6. You get several pieces of fish and the cornmeal breading is so full of flavor. I thought mine was great, but Joel's chicken... Wow! I wanted to rip it away from him. I wanted to order more chicken just for myself, but I was so full from the fish! His waffle was cooked crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Now let's talk about those chili cheese fries. They came in a large to go container smothered in chili and cheese! What more could you ask for! YUMMY!  The only down side is that there is no bathroom, but they do have a sink so you can wash all the tasty goodness off in. Also, be prepared to wait 'cause they cook everything to order. Which is totally fine in my book!   Yes, Sunny's, I will for sure be back for lots and lots of chicken!! What a great gem to have found! Thanks Yelp! You rock!"}
{"text":"So I found this hole in the wall via Yelp reviews, and the food looked really good.  So I decided to go and check it out.  We got in there and the owner was working the register.  He was very polite.  There was another customer in there, that had never been here either.  He was so excited to try it.  He said he passed this spot all the time and never saw it.  Any way, I ordered the Southern fried fish, fried xtra crispy.  Hubby ordered the fried chicken with potatoes salad.  Ok, so this isn't a fast food place, so don't be in a hurry.  I think we waited about 25 to 30 min.  The place is gross!  The windows, and doors are just nasty!  I didn't want to think about it too much!  (I just hoped the kitchen isn't like the dining area)  So we finally got our food, and it was amazing!  My fish was so crispy, and seasoned!  I only have 2 pieces in the photo, but they gave me 4 nice size pieces.   I told my husband if he comes here and I'm not with him, he needs to bring me some food.  This is a must try spot!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good, greasy, comfort food for a great price. For under $4 you can get chicken wings and fries or chicken and waffles. I came for the chicken and waffles, but ended up liking the chicken wings and fries the best. The chicken wings have this salty, ranch powder that is finger licking good. Good crunch on fries too. Although the chicken and waffles is a great value, this wasn't the best I ever had. Not on Roscoe's level. I think maybe it was the waffle. It wasn't as crisp as I'd like it. Overall seasonings on fried chicken and waffles could be more flavorful too.  The hot sauce and maple syrup kind of make up for it though.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 62/100"}
{"text":"One word....WOW!! First the philly.. Dam that was bom.com! Chk and waffle... For $3.99 OMG wow wow wow so good and the chk wings tasted just like BWW. Deff my new spot, place looks like a whole in the wall but trust me, the food makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"Got two piece chicken and  waffle. So good chicken was perfect! Waffle was good! Great prices too! Should've got more chicken but the wait was pretty long other than that it was perfect!"}
{"text":"You might think, \"can't complain for the price\" but a few bux worth of crap is still crap.  The wing quality is awful. Completely dry, without exaggeration.  Its either super overcooked or left out overnight. The meat is like early stages of jerky.  I don't care if the wings are free."}
{"text":"My first ELITE REVIEW! First things first I'd like to thank my wife Joy for inspiring me to become a yelper, second I'd like to thank Taylor and all the yelpers for all the nominations.   Now with that being said it's only right that my first elite yelp go out to one of my ultimate favorite chicken spots Sunnys market, since it was on the westside (lake mead and D Street), I've been eating from sunnys. I was around 12yrs. and since day one my experience has been incredible and I have not been able to find another chicken spot with the same flavor and great price!   Sunny himself has an awesome personality, once he knows you he makes sure to greet you (he likes when you say what's up sunny), even if he doesn't know you he still makes you feel welcome.  Because sunnys is mainly found in pretty rough neighborhoods it's really easy to pass it up, but hood or not I've seen every race and almost every working class citizen ordering from him!   Sunnys menu is very simple with a southern style swing, my favorite is the hot wings and the 2 piece snack (breast and wing) with a side of fries. It's best to order if it's around lunch time but everyone knows if sunny answers his phone consider it a miracle!   So If your ever on the east side (Washington and lamb) area make sure to stop by and check him out for yourself it's an experience you'll never forget!   P.s. Tell him Young O.G sent you!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! The exterior and interior doesn't appeal to the eye. But, the food is just amazing! That's why I keep coming back if I want wings!"}
{"text":"Sunnys chicken fingers are good. A couple of times they were dry. It was take out so i didn't know until I got home. We were disappointed! On average though, Sunnys has good food. I recommend calling your order ahead of time. They're usually pretty busy, at least that's been my experience. The lady who takes the orders has always been nice as well."}
{"text":"Chicken is super good, and the wings are delicious. The fries are perfectly seasoned and the staff is friendly. It's just a bit of a wait at times."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive. But I was in the area and they had good ratings on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the hot chicken wings and fries. The chicken wings were good, flavorful and hot. The service is not top notch but kind of what you would expect from a hole in the wall. I won't be going back, I was just too uncomfortable being there. Everything just seems so dirty and I didn't want to sit down or touch anything. Even though they had an \"A\" rating from the health district."}
{"text":"Fried fish and fries -3 star. Basic fish , basic fries. Lack of taste.  Gizzards- 1 star. The chewiest gizzards ever tasted. I felt like I was chewing on rubber bands with some seasoning. Parmesean Garlic wings- 1 star. Dry ass chicken that taste like they just sprinkled some salt and black pepper. Wheres the garlic and parmesean ingredients??! The waiting time- -0 stars if possible. We waited 30 min for our food.  Coleslaw- Tasted bland. KFC's better. Hell, mine is by far better!  I always rely on yelp for reviews and this is the first time Im very disappointed."}
{"text":"Sonnys was really good. There was a line out the door but it moved fast.  The inside is small but there were still a place to sit and wait for food. I ordered the southern fish and it was good, but could have used some more seasonings.  My daughter got the cheese steak sandwich and that was delicious.  Perfect amount of onions, peppers, cheese  and meat. I'll deffinetly go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great customer service, the whole family is very nice & welcoming. Food is amazing, really the best wings in town!"}
{"text":"Sooo my husband just brought this home. He had it on superbowl sunday and said nothing but good things about it but this is my first time eating it. It was PERFECT, A1, THE BOMBBBB!!!!! We got the 40pc with 2. Large Sides of fries. $25... Yhe wings seem a little larger than wingstops wings but these are actually a lot tastier!!! My 7 year old had 8 pieces. He ate more than me and my husband who both ate 6 and 7. We had lemon pepper and regular hot... The hot was my favorite but the lemon pepper was good too! We decided at the table that this is most definitely our new chicken spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place, but the wait can really be rough. The times that I've went, the place was packed with people waiting for their orders.   The food is really good but The wait time and general inconvenience didn't offset that. If you aren't in a hurry and want reasonably good food for a good price and time isn't an issue then this is a good option"}
{"text":"Very personalized service and great food.  That was the best fried chicken I've had in a while and the Cole Slaw was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house and although the people that own it are SUPER NICE PEOPLE...because of them taking the pulled chicken and waffles off the menu....I decided to try their 2 piece and well...neither me or my wife were impressed (my wife remarked that Church's Chicken is better)...and trust me I wanted to be BLOWN AWAY by this place as it's close and they're good people...but it was just ok....and that sucks"}
{"text":"My husband discovered this place and he made me try it. They have the BEST chicken and waffles. You may see the building and think this place looks suspect but they have great food and customer service.  We place our order ahead and no wait."}
{"text":"Where do I start... It is better than the old Sunny's as far as no one trying to hustle you on the way in, but it will get that way because I notice more and more hoodrats coming about. The first order was for my husband and his chicken was bloody. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was very thick chicken that sometimes people accidentally under cook. The other customers are sometimes rude as hell!  I like the chicken livers (since I'm anemic) and have not had a problem with those. The workers are polite. Sometimes it smells funny in there but other then that the place is clean. The orders are limited and fries are too greasy."}
