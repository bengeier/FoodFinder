{"text":"I'm a huge lover of Asian food and haven't had the best of luck in finding a good place. I've been here twice and the food is just absolutely delicious! It's a very tidy and clean place, which is  much appreciated. The interior is modern and welcoming and to top it off the customer service is astounding. The food is great, affordable, and you have a bunch of yummy left overs as well. This place deserves way much more traffic than it has. I strongly urge anyone who loves Asian food to give them a try, they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super clean! Oh. And great service.. Good sized portions I can complain that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I have ever try! Delicious mango lemonade. Excellent service, i will recommend."}
{"text":"Good service had the chicken pad thai.  Wasn't that spicy could have turned the heat up a bit and I wouldn't have cared but very fresh and good portion size."}
{"text":"Impressed with everything pho was delicious staff was very awesome * please tip them they work very hard , the mango lemonade is the best thing I've ever had"}
{"text":"Great new place!!! I will definitely be back!!! Very good Asian mix! Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese was awesome concept!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I've had out in a long time. Everything was made fresh and the portions on the lunch menu are perfect. If you haven't been here yet, it's worth the trip. The Mongolian beef was bomb and the orange chicken was awesome too. But the Singapore noodles were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho!!! They were even able to accommodate my special request of vegetable broth for the tofu vegetable pho. The tofu was perfect and the pho was robust, and packed with amazing herbs, seasoning, and spices. Thank you so much for the great experience and can not wait to come back. :)"}
{"text":"We tried to find something quick and nearby for dinner and Asian Corner Cafe popped up as a \"hot and new\" restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised by the menu and the variety of food. We ended up getting the Spicy Sweet Chili Chicken, Vegetable Fried Rice and Chicken Potstickers and we LOVED every part of it. The server was very polite and made sure our waters were always topped off. Very happy with the food and service. Will definitely be back to try other things! Highly recommend this local business!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  This placed stepped up. I actually had a good meal.  I ordered the war wonton soup, it wasn't like other places.  There were different ingredients but still pretty good.  I also ordered the orange chicken.   I thought was pretty damn good and fresh.   It took longer than expected to get the order considering there weren't many people there.  But that's ok.  They brought the soup first,  then when I was done there was the chicken.  Planned or happy accident,  don't know,  don't care. It worked for me. Also,  they were attentive to my ice tea running low.  But took my glass to refill it.  That was wierd. Good job Asian corner."}
{"text":"We came here to have Pho but got a little hesitation when we found out that it was not own by a Vietnamese owner.   Glad that we didn't hesitated to try other food though otherwise we could have been missing out on how yummy they were.  We tried mango lemonade, tom kha, chicken and broccoli stir fried, chicken pad Thai, salt and pepper pork chops and Singapore noodles.  We definitely will try Pho next time."}
{"text":"Delicious Asian food. I ordered the green curry with tofu and it was fantastic! The portion sizes were generous and I was able to bring home leftovers. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"BEST Mongolian Beef!  The Pho and Thai soups are amazing, too! The owner Barry is really nice.  He cares about the food and his customers.  This is one of the BEST Asian restaurants in Chandler.  Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here and we ordered two dishes. Mongolian beef and crab fried rice with lobster sauce on it. The fried rice was okay but my Mongolian beef was extremely salty. The service was really good though..I'm just not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"We've been twice and it's excellent! The prices are great and the portions are big too. They have some genius chefs cooking in the kitchen, big thanks to you guys, and top notch service out front.  When you find a gem like this you want to let everyone know, so here it is. We'll be back soon for another great meal. Keep up the good work Asian Corner Cafe!"}
{"text":"I love supporting local, family owned places! The food here is solidly in the \"yummy\" category. The staff (all family), were very nice and greeted us with smiles. Service was quick. Food is fresh, with big pieces of protein / veggies. You can actually tell what you are eating. Lunch portions are a great size especially for the price. Def. worth a try. If I'm in the area I'll definitely try other dishes. I had the Thai basil chicken.  It wasn't super spicy (for me), so I added some chili oil. Just right."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so friendly and inviting I feel like I am a part of the family! Welcomed by many smiles. The food is delicious and fresh. Not to mention it didn't take long at all to receive our food. Overall would recommend this new place to anyone! The place has a really cool atmosphere and design. Very great  menu with Thai Vietnamese and Chinese options! Good for everyone! Their beverages are so refreshing and homemade!!"}
{"text":"The Thai chicken is fantastic and made fresh!!  The summer rolls were good, but could've been rolled a bit tighter.  It made them slightly difficult to handle, but the flavor was there and the peanut sauce was very good. You might find this place a bit difficult to find if you use the map, it's around the corner from Bashas to the West, worth the effort."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty.  We got take out, but checked out the restaurant when I picked up the order.  It was very clean.  We fed 10 people with our order and everyone liked it.  We will be back!!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Panag curry... it has no peanut flavor and it was sour instead... not Thai curry whatsoever"}
{"text":"Great little place. Did take out, so can't speak about dining in. But, my order was done right at the 15 minute time frame. We ordered the Bangkok Fried Rice w/ Shrimp and the Yellow curry w/ chicken. My shrimp was cooked perfectly and everything was nicely seasoned and veggies still nice and crisp and not over cooked. Husband enjoyed the curry, said he wishes it was a bit spicier ( he likes really spicy food though!) We will be going again, for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food. Would give a 5, but you have to blow my mind for that. Food was very good, fresh tasting, and not greasy. Menu selection was not huge but still suffice. The freshness was the best part and great staff. This is my second time and they still did good."}
{"text":"Who is leaving positive reviews for this place? Friends and family? No way does it deserve more than two stars and those two are for the lemonade and the clean shrimp.   We placed our order to go and the person who took our order even repeated it so I knew he understood.  But when we got home, we could see they either screwed up our order or have no clue what some dishes actually are. Look at the photo I posted of the container that says Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. It's brown liquid with peppers. Nothing at all like actual shrimp with lobster sauce and the worst part is that I specifically requested thick sauce not watery. Extremely disappointing to say the least and an obvious sign they have no clue what they're doing.   The soups we ordered were hot and sour and egg flower. Both were subpar and neither were made properly. Peas and carrots in the hot and sour soup and it lacked flavor.   Also ordered the kung pao shrimp. The only decent part of the meal was the shrimp but there weren't many unfortunately. No spice to it and hardly any peanuts.   The General Tso's chicken was bland and not spicy.  The shrimp fried rice was again, boring and had no flavor but the shrimp was good.   I appreciated that they offered brown rice but they charge extra for it and it's Minute Rice. Another disappointment.  This is so bland and Americanized that it's laughable. No flavor, not made properly, carrots were hard and undercooked, and disappointing overall. Will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim, wanted to try someplace new.  One of my favorites is across the street.   I should have stuck to my usual. Any new place serving Thai food I use yellow curry as the litmus test.   These folks added pineapple and green beans to the standard.   Although I am not opposed to the idea, the curry was sweetened too much for me by the pineapple.   The Asian donut desert they threw in was presented very nicely, but it was just a small cake donut square drizzled with chocolate sauce.   Service was quick"}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant.  Food and service very good.  We tried a cup of the hot and sour soup which was excellent.  Nice large pieces of vegetables and shrimp.  Flavor was perfect - nice and spicy.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken as my entree which had a yummy sauce and nice large pieces of vegetables.  Really delicious.  My husband ordered vegetable chop suet which he enjoyed.  We will definitely return to try more of their delicious entrees."}
{"text":"the food was excellent ?I will recommend this place if you like asian food?good to try different types of asian food in same place...BTW?very good service and friendly?"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai basil dish. The summer rolls was very tasty.  The lunch portions are large."}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious food; you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Asked for more of a medium level spice to my food and it was just right for the level of heat. The mango lemonade complimented the food nicely. Will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"This has become a new favorite of mine.  The food came out quick, and was delicious.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  My only complaint is that they had CNN playing on the tv disrupting the good vibes."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant lunch here. Thai iced tea was exactly as it should be. Shrimp pad Thai included a nice cup of rather bland soup, tasty egg roll, and for $1 extra, fried rice. Service was very good, Cafe nice and clean, food served hot and fresh. I would like this place more if the food was tastier. I was hoping for Thai spice, and it tasted like good Chinese. Portion was ample, acceptable value. I really wanted more Thai flavor though."}
