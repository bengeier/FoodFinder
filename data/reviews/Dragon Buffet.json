{"text":"I'll admit to being a Chinese buffet junkie. I've sought out all the buffets in the Pineville, south Charlotte area, and this one does it better than the rest. I see some of the other reviews complain about lack of selection here, but for my tastes, this is far and away the best. The dishes I like here are mostly chicken, and they have quite a few varied styles which are really tasty. You have to accept that its a BUFFET, so the classic dishes you might order in a fancy place are not all available, but what's there is excellent every visit. You cannot do better anywhere for a $10.00 buffet !!"}
{"text":"We love this place the food is always fresh and the service is great we have never had a bad experience with this place. We look forward to coming here every time we are out this way."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times, never dissapoints for $8. Good variety and they are constantly refreshing the food trays. Me and friends from work go here for lunch 1, twice a month. Best cheap Chinese I've found in the CLT area over the last 4 years."}
{"text":"They were better before their changes they made on the place It's not even a restaurant were enjoy the scenery they put TV's in there but the food there sometimes it's amazing then at other times it's ehh."}
{"text":"Price is not bad. The food is good. This is my first of many visits. If your going to want better you will need to go to New York city or Los Angeles"}
{"text":"This was one of the smaller chinese buffets I have seen. Everything was pretty decent. The sesame chicken stood out to me and everybody and their mama was loading up on the butter shrimp. The lunch buffet is about $8 and that seems pretty fair.  There were no major negatives. It's a solid place. But it's by no means outstanding. Nothing made me think to myself that this was going to be in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Well, if you leave here hungry it's your own fault.  This is an Americanized Chinese restaurant buffet.  You pay one price, about $10.99 and then it's all you can eat!  They have 2 long buffets of chicken, pork, shrimp and beef fixed lots of ways with some veggies, rice and Chinese dumplings.  They also have a small sushi bar and salad bar and a desert bar!!!  It was crowded with people looking for a real bargain!  Most of the things I tried were very tasty.  The ice creams  were good but i'd forget about the rest of the deserts.  In all . . . go when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"**Updated review**  After staying away from the Dragon Buffet for about a year I decided to give it another try and I figured a 3 star rating was fair. I understand that it's a small business and all so... The hostess and girls who get your refills were pleasant, The food was actually very good tasting. The carpets were still pretty filthy along with the very uncomfortable booths and somewhat dirty walls next to the booths (food splatter and such) My biggest complaint with this place are the bathrooms. Holly crap are they dirty! I understand that the gangster type people carve up the counters and mirrors so this isn't the places fault however the filthy bathrooms really need to be cleaned with a pressure washer and industrial chemicals. As a guy I can stand at the urinal however I would NEVER sit on a toilet at this place! Overall this place needs a very thorough cleaning. They did install a new flat screen TV but no more traditional Chinese music. I'll return to eat however I will be cautious of my surroundings. For me it's convenient as it's not to far away and the $6.45 price isn't bad. (the drink is extra)  If the Dragon Buffet reads these reviews then please try and clean the place up just a bit. I understand that many of your customers are simply dirty and let their children run wild, try posting a sign to resolve this issue. Perhaps have a key for the rest rooms?"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if the app would let me. I had a terrible experience at Dragon Buffet off of S. Tryon St. this weekend. I should have realized my mistake when the trays were scarcely empty with just 2-3 pieces in them. I kept being told by servers that more food would be out in a couple minutes.  I decided to \"snack\" on what was left while waiting for the food to be replenished. My husband chose not to eat at all in his disappointment. Still no food was brought out. We ended up calling it a loss and paid the full adult buffet charge and left. About an hour after getting home; I started to feel really sick...stomach cramps and nauseated.  This soon turned into an \"all nighter\" of running back and forth to the bathroom being sick and feeling absolutely miserable for 2 days. After researching the North Carolina Public Health Inspections I can see why. Wish I would have reviewed that first.  Please learn from my mistake and misery and pass on this place who would rather take short cuts instead of considering others well being."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese spot in Charlotte. Great food at a decent price. Fast service, enjoyable atmosphere and a nice selection of items."}
{"text":"I didn't like the food at all and the ambience isn't great either I wouldn't recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"The service was so fucking bad!the waitress didn't care about the customer,that was the worst waitress that I have ever MET!!"}
{"text":"The entire experience was unfortunate. We just moved into the area and are looking for our new regular Chinese place. I went in and ordered off their take-out menu. Not only did she grab a lot of it from the buffet, she forgot soy sauce, duck sauce, fortune cookies, silverware; and there's certainly no seasoning on the food either. My cats enjoyed it though. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in the city. Food is always fresh, but the fried rice needs improvement. Service is always helpful. Prices are great and although the place is about 10 years old, it still keeps a nice atmosphere. It gets very busy during weekdays lunch hours."}
{"text":"Unpredictable each visit.  Checked the county health code web site and decided to stop going."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of buffet but the food was not bad. The place seems clean and the waitress just can't wait to take your empty plate away.   So sure I'll come back... some time next year. And no, won't write home about the experience."}
{"text":"First of all its chinese then buffet. I was here with my collagues, oh my ... i dont know what they are using instead of meat. its was lack of spices than no way to hide the poor quality of the meat. And long line...i really dont understand people. Chinese food needs attention. And should be always prepared as orrder. Not like buffet and waiting on the counter too long. I wont be back and will make my collagues not to come back again neither."}
{"text":"Convenient, however my first experience the food was extremely greasy, and over seasoned.  I went this past week and I figured I would get vegetables and salmon is on the buffet, however within 30 minutes I was in the bathroom constantly and it was so bad it was better I just stayed at work because I didn't think I could make the drive home."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place my husband and I like to go for take out, and we have dined in many times here. The location is in good distance to other shopping in the area and the staff is always very friendly. Overall the place is very clean, due to the popularity it can be rather cramped when there is a full house but you really just need to time it out. Take out consists of a decent size Styro foam box and costs about $5 a pound. There is a lot of great dishes to choose from and the staff is always refilling the selection, it can be a really nice alternative when you are looking for a quick hot meal for an early lunch or late evening. There doesn't appear to be a restriction of the take out boxes as we always fill them to the brim with lots of great choices. Both across the board Asian dishes and a few American classics for the picky eaters and kids (pizza, cheese sticks, chicken tenders) and classic Asian buffet deserts (what are those amazing coffee flavored, layered, square things?! AMAZING!!) Overall, I think it is worth checking out, they also serve beer in house so there may be the extra bead of incentive you need."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this buffet. Pepper chicken did not taste great, they had mozzarella sticks? Some of the white rice wasn't cooked thoroughly. Royal buffet down the street is much better"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff ,they seated us promptly. Once seated, the waiter quickly took our drink order . The restaurant was clean & comfortable, not too noisy. The food was good . The price is reasonable  about $11 per person for the buffet ,and about $1.50 per drink,the children they charge for their age."}
{"text":"This is my favorite American Chinese in the area. Yes it's buffet but has a large menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and good!  If you like asian buffets, this is one of the better ones.  Lunch is always full, but they move people in and out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet experience, though on a smaller than normal scale.  The garlic shrimp was the best item....very salty but I like it that way.  The service we received was good, very attentative."}
{"text":"The Food Good it depends on what you like compared to most Buffett the one thing i can say is never go on a Sunday or a Monday maybe not so much Tuesday because you will notice they reheat a lot of things. One thing you always wanna do like Ihop come hungry and leave happy. The owners and staff ask that when you visit to please be patience and curitous to others that are dinning and to leave some for the other customers that might be wannting to enjoy the same food as you.        Please limit your trips to the bufee station when your refilling on seconds during your stay remember always try something new instead of going back for the same thing. If you have an allergy or your not sure about something that might cause a health problem please don't be affraid to ask the staff or the owners."}
{"text":"This is the first buffet I have ever found that has the same quality food in a buffet as a take out Chinese restaurant. Yes, it's not high end, and yes these are not the highest quality ingredients...but that should never be reasons to go to a buffet! Everything we tried was great, and I think we tried everything! Very small in comparison to your big box buffets, but s probably why everything is so good. Nothing last too long on the warmers,so food is always fresh...sushi is great although very little variety. We have our new go to buffet when we want to have a little of everything"}
{"text":"Place was nice but the food didn't impress me as much. We ended up eating here because Tin Tin was closed for renovations."}
{"text":"Family of 5. We were skeptical at first because the parking lot was empty at 4:30pm on a Sunday but we're super glad we went inside. The buffet was fantastic. Very clean, fresh, and a huge variety.  The service was superb. We can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Been dining here for years, and they've been consistent with the quality of their food. The coconut chicken, bourbon chicken, salmon, hot and sour soup, pakoras are excellent. The sushi is too large and not flavorful, and their desserts consist of a very good rice pudding and blah items like macaroons and ice cream. Very nice staff; glad the wait staff has stopped hovering and trying to grab plates you haven't stopped eating off of - that was extremely annoying."}
{"text":"Good, cheap chinese food.  All you can eat for lunch on a Sunday for $7.95?  Sure!  Why not?!  You can also take out food for around $3.50/lb.  Nothing particularly special, but clean and nice staff.  Food is refreshed regularly so you are not staring at empty trays.  The fantasy chicken was something I haven't had before and I was pleasantly surprised.  It could use more desserts in my opinion, but having apple pie a la mode satisified my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place, I disagree.  You know when you walk into a place and you get the \"me thinks not\" feeling. Well, go with you gut or else your gut will get you in return. Ya know what I mean?"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat. The food is fantastic and cheap. You may not want to go on Sunday afternoons because it always has a large church crowd."}
{"text":"Dragon Buffet is a decent, competitively-priced Asian buffet that is within close proximity to my office.  The buffet is almost entirely meat.  Don't get me wrong; their selection of different Asian style meats were great, but I would have appreciated more choices of vegetables other that just buttered broccoli and limp cabbage.  My favorite food from the buffet was their their \"baked crabmeat\".  It was imitation crab, but still tasted great.  Good thing I'm generally a fan of cheap white fish.  Their service wasn't the best.  While we were being seated, our host got distracted by something and just forgot about us.  Our waitress got my friend's drink order wrong, too.  All this must have been due to the fact that the place was filled nearly to capacity.  At $6.95 for an adult weekday lunch buffet, I'll certainly give Dragon Buffet another shot."}
{"text":"Good American Chinese food! Staff is always friendly. Food is always fresh. I prefer getting takeout because I'm not able to eat more than one plate when dining in, but if I get a takeout box I can have at least two meals for l about $10!!  It's a great price for good quality food and great service.   Great options: chicken wings, teriyaki chicken, green beans, Indian chicken, egg foo young..."}
{"text":"Decent is a fair word to describe Dragon Buffet food. My husband and I wanted to try this for somewhere different to go. The food was typical Chinese buffet quality for the most part. Buffet was kept cleaner than some I've been at. They had a tray of heavily buttered broccoli that was ok. Mushrooms we're ok. Spring rolls were good. I liked the breaded shrimp but hubby did not. I did have to wait longer than usual for the low mein to be replenished and when it finally was, I was disappointed in the flavor. It appeared that some of the food had been sitting out a long time and needed replaced... had that dry and absorbed look. We most likely won't be back here. We both agree that we'd try another new place instead."}
{"text":"It took me a while to find this place because \"buffet\" is usually a term that scares me away! Many factors make this place special. To begin with, the food is excellent! Beef Broccoli, Chicken Broccoli, Bourbon Chicken, dumplings, won ton soup......all excellent!! They have it all: sushi (very good), fruits, cold salad items, and even an ice cream station. The lunch buffet is a bargain at $6.50, before tax!! They also have a take out option where you pay by the weight once you have filled up your take out container. The other factor that makes them stand out is how clean everything is: when any of the staff has extra time you will see them cleaning and polishing the light fixtures, surfaces and even the entry area. The food area is very clean as well, and they keep all items freshly stocked. I saw them refill the dumplings  today and they removed the two \"old\" ones that were left, and replaced the whole tray. The owners are very friendly and take obvious pride in the quality of their food and the cleanliness of the place. Although it is a buffet, the staff gets empty plates off your table as soon as you make a return trip. (I know this is obvious, but I am amazed at how many \"buffets\" don't get this concept)."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place at all. The food was strange and there was no sushi. I probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I dont mind a good buffet, although when I see too much food spread out all at once, I mysteriously lose my appetite (?) But Dragon buffet is one I will always fall back on when Im hit with a sudden asian buffet craving.    I love their buttered shrimp, although you have have lady luck with you when they bring them out.  People pile them in their plates higher than the himalayas!  I mean, c'mon people, Im right behind you praying that Ill get alteast 2 pieces!  But they are that good.  Greed will take over when you taste them.  I also get the green beans, which they load with garlic (a good thing if you dont plan on a smooch-fest later), soy glazed mushrooms, a fake crab casserole, scallops with zucchini, etc.  Soups are yummy too and they even have a dumpling section (but its pork, so I didnt taste it).  Sometimes they have Singapore noodles, which has a good curry flavor other times its just lo-mein.  They even have sea bass and salmon on the buffet (not all the time, I guess its seasonal) They offer good options for vegetarians and pescatarians like myself.  I didnt bother looking at the other protein dishes but they're good and plenty.  Crab rangoons are too cream cheesy, but doesnt stop me from eating them.  A good deal for under $8.00 for lunch."}
{"text":"I dont really go to buffets, mostly because the food sits out a long time if there arent many people at the place. Dragon Buffet is different. This place is very busy at all times. I have never eaten inside at the table. Always takeout. It is such a steal. My boyfriend and I go, grab a to go box and fill it up. Usually with their perfectly steamed rice, bourbon chicken, great broccoli and usually some of the good ol General Tsao chicken. We fill up the box and we both eat for under 11 bucks. To sit is much more but still totally affordable."}
{"text":"With so many Chinese food places in the area this one has to be my 1st choice. I've sampled others so no, I'm not being biased. I rarely eat buffet style here, I typically just order to go and I am happy with it. One thing so will say is that sometimes they will charge extra for pork fried rice and etc, so make sure you check it because on more then one instance they didn't add the meat and I was charged for it. I wish they delivered and is would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Place was clean, and we were seated almost immediately. Food was okay. Thought it was unusual for there to be pizza out at the buffet. But for kids I can understand. Probably won't be back as every Chinese place is different and has different ways of cooking their meals. Their crab Rangoon was good but general tso's was horrible."}
{"text":"Love the tempura shrimp and the chicken & broccoli. They are consistent and have a great flavor to most of the foods, which keeps me going back."}
{"text":"It's ok there are better selections in the area for a Chinese buffet. Not terrible but basically it's pretty standard as far as food and service goes. Not a huge selection at all tho, they could of done better"}
{"text":"This will be my Buffet spot, it is like regular Chinese buffet but has great food everything tasted fresh and hot. Their fried rice and fried potatoes look so yummy it does not look greasy and cheap like in most Chinese buffet. Loved the ice cream selection Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla and Oreo   The place is very clean and the service is very welcoming!  Also a good price for a buffet our bill was about $21 for the adults dinner and one soft drink !!! It can not get better than that for the quality!!"}
{"text":"The. Salmon. Is. Every. Thing. This place always has great food and great service. It's the best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte hands down."}
{"text":"Worst food ever for health conscious eaters.  Most of the selection was too greasy and had way too much breading, with very little healthy choices of fruits and veggies. The sushi was a lame effort. Indigestion lasted 15 hours.  Don't go."}
{"text":"Great staff good food Chinese never fails I don't go here as much as I should but when I do go I love getting the buffet to go they don't have that many selections but it's pretty good for the most part"}
{"text":"When the cockroach scurried between my drink , plate and then the salt and pepper, I made  a quick escape.  Sadly the food here is pretty good but the place has become nasty. The gray film on the white phone, the front door and the restrooms should have been enough to worn me off."}
{"text":"We went back here last Sunday with our daughter.  Unfortunately my daughter didn't like anything on the buffet.  I thought that the food was OK but not up to their usual standards.  We gave them our coupons with the bill as usual, had to wait a long time to get the receipt and credit card back, then they didn't take the coupons off of the bill."}
{"text":"A little gem in Charlotte. Was looking for a Chinese Buffet and the manager at the hotel I was at recommended Dragon Buffet. I am really glad he did. Two words to describe this restaurant would be clean and fresh.      It is located it a small strip mall across the parking lot from Walmart. It has a small parking lot with convenient spots.     I was greeted by the manager upon arrival and  escorted to my seat. Comfortable decor and friendly staff. My server asked for my beverage order and it was at my table upon my arrival from the buffet.       Now the food was the experience. The selections were all not your standard buffet grub. You had your regular selection of soups, but the wonton were fresh and steamed.  There was also a selection of beef and vegetable Dim Sum and lightly fried pork dumplings. Some of the assorted foods were Black Pepper Beef, Indian Chicken (spicy curry sauce), boneless spare ribs and egg foo young. They also have assorted seafood dishes. Dessert selections were standard and there was scoopable ice cream.     Restaurant serves PepsiCo products and has a limited beer and wine selection.      Overall restaurant was excellent and a value. Lunch price was $7.99 per person with dinner pricing at $8.99. They also offer to go at $4.25 a pound."}
{"text":"Hot buffet in typical Chinese buffet style. Only one selection of chicken wings which is a drawback to a chicken lover like myself.  Crab meat on French bread with cheese was delicious. Although it was lunch time while I was there a couple of the dishes that I tried with lukewarm to cold, which of the problems for something like egg rolls."}
{"text":"Ok so this place was ok .. Not the best, not the worst. Some things were definitely better than others and the things that were better than others were pretty average. The clams were DISGUSTING! This may sound weird but, you know how sea world smells? Well, that's what the claims tasted / smelled like. Gross. They do have other seafood options, including sushi, but after trying the clams I decided it was best to stay away from things that live in water.   So, when you consider the price of take out Chinese and what you get, you can get all you can eat for that price here. I love me some Chinese food, trust! But I also know that takeout Chinese is 99.999% of the time all I can eat. Difference with the all you can eat buffet: smaller portions of different dishes. You want pepper steak, lo mein, orange chicken, pot stickers? Go buffet. Just want pepper steak and some rice? Definitely take out.  I'm not saying I wouldn't ever eat here again but certainly no special trips and would consider other options."}
{"text":"Typical, run of the mill, Chinese buffet that you would expect on any hot buffet line anywhere in the good ole US of A.   The place was 100% full and ultra busy on a Saturday at lunch, ensuring good quick food turn over.  The servers are pleasant and hustle.  The manager would die if he cracked a smile.    Listen up HATERS, it is $7.99 for lunch, get over yourself, it is down and dirty, nothing fancy........  Some notes:  1.  Sushi is below average and nasty.    2.  The black pepper pork is actually terrific, its a sweet pepper sauce, I have never had anything like it.  3.  The Vietnamese Rolls are interesting, kind of like a Mexican beef taqiuito, but with an Asian spill.   Really good.    4.  Crab meat and cheese casserole was pretty good, especially when you scoop it on the French buttered bread.  5.  The buttered fried shrimp were tasty.  That is all folks, have a RICE day!  :-)"}
{"text":"I don't come here often, it seems the last few times here it is going do hill.  Screaming children that the parents don't do anything about. The staff mixes them in with everyone rather than trying to have a peaceful area for others."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Chinese buffets I've been too, the  chicken tasted like good chicken all very fresh and juicy nothing was dried out. Great crab Rangoon that is one of my favorite things at Chinese restaurant and those were the best I've ever had. The fantasy chicken was incredible. I enjoyed every piece of my meal from beginning to being able to scoop my own strawberry & cookies and cream ice cream :) yumm. The only thing that would make this place better is if the wait staff were more friendly."}
{"text":"I am not a Chinese food lover, I eat only a few dishes so this review is specific to those.  Buffet: No generals chicken Sesame chicken tasted old, tough. Took only 2 bites. Bourbon chicken was pretty good. Sweet and sour chicken was pretty plain, as it normally is. Teriyaki chicken was good. Ribs were ok, sweet and sticky. Sugar donuts were dense.  Did not enjoy.  Not a huge buffet, but, they had some things I don't normally see.  Ckean, kept well stocked."}
{"text":"Cheap and fast. You get what you pay for. Probably would have been more stars if the server hadn't given us the check when we first started eating. A bit rude and basically telling us to hurry up and go. Very busy for lunch."}
{"text":"food was good not great, the butter popcorn shrimp was better the other places. Cost was averge we dined in and try most of the food. Was standard mixed buffet. not a lot of asian food, sushi was not good.  The place needs make over dull and no shine to the place."}
{"text":"This was certainly the best Chinese buffer I've ever eaten.  The was a vast variety of different kinds of Chinese food, and to my surprise, the food was excellent.  I tried ~12-14 of their dishes including a variety of rices and each and every one was delicious.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"After spending the day at Carowinds, Our Family decided to eat here after searching YELP for a buffet style restraunt to eat at.  Prior reviews seemed favorable so Dragon Buffet  was the choice.  Easy access off 485 & Tryon. We arrived around 3:30, no waiting and only a couple other families were eating.  My wife and I, along with our 5 boys ( 17, 16, 14, 10 , 7 ) were seated, ordered our drinks, and then went to the bufett.  They have a great selection, including Sushi.  The food was great, some buffets the food is dried out from sitting so long. the staff was very attentitive to the buffet, keeping it clean and stocked. Desert Bar and 4 selections of Ice Cream!  the restraunt itself was clean and attractive  The best part was of course feeding a family of 7 for $54  I do not know if prices change in the evening, but I can say Dragon Buffet will be a regular stop for us when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!  Yes it is a buffet....excellent selection of meats, vegetables, and fried items. Soups were hot and fresh. I really enjoyed the fantasy chicken and spring rolls. The ribs and bourbon chicken were excellent. Service was attentive and restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"This is a nice establishment. Workers were Very polite, even the greeter who answers the phone was patient, & assisted me over the phone with finding the location lol. However my waiter seemed to be aggravated for whatever reason. Oan: Their food bar looked appealing, with a pretty nice variety. Their sautéed broccoli is good, as the same with their salmon. Both I would give an 8/10.  I'm not that great of a fan of the chicken in the chicken & broccoli, but again the broccoli is more legit. I'm definitely a fan of their teriyaki chicken, it seems as though it was grilled on an outdoor grill (some may not be a fan of it having those little partial burnt flakes, but I love grilled food). I usually love sesame chicken but I'm Really not a fan of theirs, to the extent it's about an 3 or 4/10. Also I'm a BIG sweet tea fan and theirs is horrible... Lol Maybe i caught the bad/older pitchers that was made, but it was just terrible.."}
{"text":"Assuming you're looking for a Chinese buffet (Why else would you go somewhere named \"DRAGON BUFFET\"?) you'll find satisfaction here.  The place is clean and the decor is pleasing.  The selection is pretty good and the location is convenient.  I like to come here when I get burned out on Royal Panda (also nearby).  Try the Indian Chicken and the Mongolian Beef.  Both are very good!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese buffet. Everything is great and the employees are very nice. I've been coming here for years and no other buffet around the area compares. Prices are very reasonable especially for lunch. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"It is simply the worst restaurant  i have ever been to in my entire life. (I'm 39).  I don't even know where to start.  Even though it was completely empty; we waited several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there.   We sat down.   The place is filthy. Dusty. Grimy. Greasy. Terrible.   Should have just left. But I really wanted to see what the food was like. The rice was burnt and I not sure that was actual chicken in the dishes."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. My husband doesn't like Chinese buffets, so while he was out of town, I came here alone. My first round of food was cold. As more people came in, they brought out more food and that was hot. The lo memo was good, the general Taos was good and the peanut chicken was good. The salad was fresh and crisp and the soup that I had was decent. The rest was ok - not bad, just not great  This is a one and done for me"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. There are bugs in the food!!!  They pretty much forced us to pay because we had already started eating. They threatened if we didn't pay they would call the police, bugs or no bugs. Disgusting!! I tried to snap a photo and the lady I complained to took the plate from my hand before I could. So gross!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the owners are the nicest people. Great food and the only reason I miss living in Medina."}
{"text":"This place needs a serious overhaul. The owners obviously don't care. Bathroom stinks, and everything in the whole place is covered in stickiness and grime. Not just that, the service is awful.  If all the reviews are bad, what does that tell you?"}
{"text":"I sometimes stop by this place when I'm around the area.  The very first time I ate there, the food was fantastic.  After that initial visit, it sorta went downhill somewhat.  This place is always packed around lunch time (weekdays).  Not sure if that's because all the other Chinese place are not buffet setup.  The only real negative about it is the small variety of dishes on the buffet line.  I wish they had more things to choose from."}
{"text":"When you think of a Chinese buffet you think the place is going to be pretty gross, Dragon Buffet is the complete opposite.    They have a great selection of your favorite American Chinese food along with some other food, such as pizza and mozzarella sticks.  One of my favorite things are the crab legs...so good.  The price is also decent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch a couple of days ago and was pleasantly surprised. The price was definitely right ($6.99 for lunch M-F). I believe it had 3-4 food islands to choose front, which was smaller than my favorite buffet in Kannapolis, but the food was delicious and fresh. Nothing tasted like it'd been sitting there for too long. My favorite was the fantasy chicken. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was superb. It's hard to find a chicken dish on a buffet that's all white meat, and this was. My only complaint was the service, which was seriously lacking. Heaven help you if you need anything after you've been seated, such as a drink refill."}
{"text":"For a Chinese Buffet, this place isn't that bad! Lots of choices, food usually fresh and hot and the restaurant is clean. If I am looking to eat a variety of Chinese dishes, I usually come here. If I am craving a particular dish, there are better places to go."}
{"text":"Nastiest, cheapest buffet I have ever eaten at. I took a few bites and left. They still made me pay even though I didn't eat anything. I will never return to this place. There isn't anything to choose from either. It's a limited buffet."}
{"text":"I have gone to Dragon for several years and the food has always been pretty good for a buffet. The food is always the same, but has always tasted pretty yummy. They make sure the food is always stocked, their servers are friendly, and the price is under $10.   There really isn't a whole lot to say, it's a buffet. It is the best buffet in town and I highly recommend going! Just make sure you go after 12pm because it's pretty packed and it can get hot in there."}
{"text":"Love this place. Once a month we always order take out (2) orders of Beef with Broccoli with White rice, (1) order of chicken wings & crab rangoos. Love the taste!"}
{"text":"I'm going to disclaimer this review & the 2 stars from the start & say that I almost always despise buffets. So if you actually enjoy the buffet style (which boggles my mind), then you may actually think Dragon Buffet is worthy of a higher rating. But the combination of buffet & Chinese (also another non fav of mine) doesn't really bode well for this review.  The food actually does taste pretty good for buffet food, from orange chicken, to beef & broccoli, to all your favs, they have quite a bit on tap. They have the usual rice options, & I actually enjoyed the vegetarian egg rolls. But I wouldn't recommend the ice cream, it's just a little too dicey for me. So they do have plenty of options & I'm sure a Chinese buffet fan would love to peruse the options all lined up for the taking. And along with the set price & rapid quick seating & service, I can see why people keep this place quite packed.  I probably won't be heading back here anytime soon, but they do have plenty of Chinese food options for a good price. So bring your appetite along with an open mind (if you're like me)."}
{"text":"First off I came here three time in hopes  of being good the the first two times. Me and my Bf went near closing so I understand the food is gonna be old and not fresh at all . But I went today in hopes of okay its lunch time so I give it a shot  so we go again and boy was I wrong it was  gross the food was old  it been sitting out for a while all the food we had was super salty and dry and on top of that it was $7.99 for the weekends that the same price as dinner and it the same food  as it is everyday which I don't why it more on the weekends  neways all I have to say is  the food is always gonna be old and dry and super salty  and the service is bad as well"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of buffets, but my 13-yo son adores buffets, especially Chinese food buffets so we frequent Dragon Buffet almost on a monthly basis.  We have tried just about every Chinese Buffet in the area and, with the exception of the expensive (but well worth it) Tin Tin, Dragon Buffet is our favorite.  We have dined there at various days and times and the food is consistently good.  It is also very reasonably priced, since they don't have crab legs.  The restaurant is very clean, the service is very good and the food is always fresh.  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ventured to Dragon Buffet Friday evening is search of my Chinese fix (I have a problem) for a respectable price. Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted and given a table as well as our drinks. The buffet is stacked with your typical Chinese staples such as many different flavors of chicken pieces, lo mein, and egg rolls. They also have no extra charge crab meat offered as well, which is nice considering many places tack on more to the bill for this. Also, something such as ice cream which is mostly served out of a machine with two flavors, was replaced with a full freezer complete with real quality self serve ice cream of notable variety. The rest of what you will find is on par with what you'll find in any buffet in Ohio, such as an average salad bar, and dessert bar.  What I helped myself to my recent visit however was a mixture of pepper steak, lo mien, and eggs rolls with a MASSIVE amount of soy sauce; and boy did it hit the spot. The lo mein and steak was perfectly cooked, and the eggs rolls just the right crispness. Dessert was also satisfying, especially when I mixed there average chocolate pudding every buffet has with there higher quality ice cream; this made for a great dessert!  One general characteristic that I thought set it apart from other more average Chinese buffet houses (Ex: Royal Buffet in Akron) is that all of the food was kept very fresh even in the absence of much business inside, and I believe is replaced very regularly.   What intervention from the staff we did require was met with smiles and kindness; from refilling drinks to processing our bill.   Speaking of which, this entire dinner buffet can be had for just $10.99 a person! The bill was around $65 for 5 people with tax included. I find this to be very reasonable, as Dragon Buffet beats most other buffets I have experienced at this price point in value.   All in all, I would definitely recommend Dragon Buffet to any lover of Chinese food who doesn't want to break the bank. The food and service are very satisfying and are of great value. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got sat immediately for Sunday lunch. Service was good. Buffet has lots of options. Dumplings and Lo mein was good. Good seemed fresh."}
{"text":"They do serve carry-outs, meaning you fill out whatever you want off the buffet - and they weight it.  Price won't break the bank - for sure! :) I really could not dine inside and stuff my mouth, for the sake of dollar's worth. Feeling so bloated afterwards. Buffet carry-outs defy IS worth every dollar AND I still can save some for later in the ref. :)"}
{"text":"Fucking Gross.  So I came here in 2006 and I really liked it back then it had more variety. I was very ardent to come back, knowing that this place was great. I asked, \" can I go walk around to see what is available?\" So I walk around and it looks clean as you can see I took some pictures.  I then decided to stay. To my demise I regret. I went to get some food sat down and the first this that happend was there was a cock roach on my fucking table. I was so grossed out.  At this point I then decided to leave, I picked up and asked for a refund. She was kind of hesitant to give it to me but I then explained that if I stayed I would around telling everybody about my experience.  There aren't enough words to describe how disgusting this is.  I wouldn't even give it 1 star."}
{"text":"One of my fav buffets in Charlotte. The Vietnamese rolls and Chicken/Broccoli are the best!   Ambiance: Nice and Cozy, albeit a lil' dim. Booth and Table seating availability.  Customer service: Some of the waitresses have language barriers, but they do their best to accommodate you, even if that means bringing over the owner.  Food: Consistently hot, fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Good food for a buffet.  One of the better Chinese Buffets in the area.  This is not a place to go if you want sushi, because while they have it, it is not a center piece, but a after thought.    They have some of the better crab rangoons that I have had at any restaurant.  3 serving islands with hot food.  The popcorn butter shrimp is very good.  The Egg Drop soup is hit or miss, the days that it is on it is great, the days they are off, it is like yellow water.  I also recommend the pepper pork, Mongolian beef, and chicken and broccoli, as they are all good.    Of course my 4 year old son always wants to go because he gets the ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"I come to this place a lot.   My favorite Item that has me tossin in the bed like i'm going through withdraws are the BUTTER POPCORN SHRIMP. The butter shrimp here will make u \"wanna slap yo momma\"  Service is FAST. I've had everthing on the buffet.. EXCEPT the sushi, salad bar (u should see it..) & desserts... I DON'T have ONE sweet tooth in my mouth.. wierd huh??  the dinner prices are about 7.95 i do believe.  Lo Mein Beef & Broccoli Spring Rolls  hey... u get the picture. They also have a little window where you can see them cooking. Cant beat that right??  *** I've heard some music in here that made me wonder if they were trying to be funny or Muzak was on strike.  I've read \"This place isn't bad to be located in a strip mall\" soooo many times it makes me wonder why is THAT a issue. FOODIE SHRUGS  like Andrew Zimmer says... if it looks good...... EAT IT!!!   CHEERS"}
{"text":"This place is dope. We walk in hungry and we have to wait 3 mins before a server shows up and then she said wait a minute because she have to help another person with their to go order. We can understand. Then she come back and asked us if we are to dine in or if we are ordering to go order? We said dine in and again she asked us to wait at the door. We decided to just  go across the street to super buffet where we have a hell of a time. With that kind of service and all these bad reviews from yelp. I sure hope you close soon cos I am not giving you any of my money."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday lunch buffet.  It was decent for the price.  Nothing was bad, just ok.  I particularly liked the sesame chicken and some of the desserts.  They have about 3-4 bars to choose from and it's really what you would expect from a typical buffet.  I wouldn't recommend trying the sushi! Just stay away from buffet sushi and you'll be fine.  The food coming out was hot and they are constantly refreshing it.  The service was good and the waiter was attentive with clearing plates and getting refills.  A lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"Others seem  to disagree, but for me and the lady, \"dragon\" is about  the only way they'd get me back here. It wasn't terrible, mind you, it just wasn't good.   There were a few stand-outs:  The Good:  1) the fried dumplings, not the traditionally prepared ones the other bad boys, the filling was spot-on 2) The crab rangoon, that extra half-teaspoon of cream cheese makes all the difference!.  Has anybody ever gotten crab in one of these anywhere?  The Bad:  1) most of the entree items  were in need of being refreshed, so doughy coldish if it was battered, just coldish if not ...odd, as the hour was noon. The chicken broccoli had no seasoning whatsoever on the chicken, so I just ate the broccoli 2) The Egg Fu Yung I don't know if was texture or what but this could not be choked down.  The Ugly  1) Who do you have to tackle to get a check?  Simple hints, like all the silverware, napkins and miscellaneous debris piled high on one's plate, and shoving all plates and glasses to the edge of the table for removal and having one's wallet and pulled credit card in plain view, did not do the trick 3) The lady removing herself to use the facilities in addition did not work 2) Even when I asked the waitress for the tab, when finally getting her attention she said ok, and disappeared into the kitchen for at least a full five minutes....did she have a bill upon returning?  ( I figured she was off finding a calculator, although since every entree is the same price one would think commiting the numbers to memory would be in the cards somewhere here.)  NO.  A fevered discussion in Mandarin eventually takes place between the host and the waitress, and furtive sideways glances occassionally are turned in our direction, the host says to us \"Just a minute\", and proceeds to seat several customers and take drink orders before returning to have a second discussion with the waitress which we ultimately resolved as there was apparently some confusion as to what we had to drink, so I told them, we had the bill plunked down with a half-hearted apology croaked from the waitress and we hopped up to the counter to pay, rather than take a chance on the timing, or indeed the occurence of a return visit. The host acted much like I do with my doctor when told to \"bend over\" as I was paying the bill, (no smart-aleck glee was NOT a component), and the traditional \"thank for your business\" that some business people offer when I put money in their pockets was not forthcoming."}
{"text":"I've had better and I've had worst too. I loved some of the food but the sushi was a big disappointment. They have the heat all the time and its uncomfortable in the booths."}
{"text":"This place is legitimately decent compared to a lot of Chinese buffets in Charlotte.  First of all its a clean and cozy atmosphere.  The coconut chicken is awesome, butter shrimp is awesome.  My only knock is they don't switch up the menu at all and put different things out there.  I'm sure they are trying to save money and not have to buy tons of product to keep switching out....but still.  I'd like to see a few more dishes with shrimp or even something with scallops.  I will continue to eat here when I cannot afford Tin Tin.  This place deserves a solid 4 stars for a Chinese buffet....start varying the menu and I will give you a 5."}
{"text":"I am scoping out the Medina food scene slowly, but surely. There aren't many buffets in Medina, but I found this one on yelp. Upon arrival, we were quickly seated and served drinks. The staff was very friendly to us.  I immediately headed to the buffet to assess the situation. I grew spoiled by the variety of buffets in and around Parma. I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with the selection here. There were five small buffet stations, which had a limited selection of items compared to what I'm used to. However, each item I sampled was delicious. So they get good marks for quality (four stars). My favorite items were chicken on a stick, pepper chicken, and chicken and mushrooms. My nephew and son really liked the cheese pizza.  As we continue down the path of Medina restaurants, I'm sure I'll visit again because this is one of the few buffets in town. And great selection aside, I'm a fool for a buffet."}
{"text":"Not the best chinese buffet I have ever been to, but it gets the job done when it comes to buffets as all chinese buffets do.  Cheap for lunch and only a little bit more expensive for dinner although I don't think you get anything extra with dinner.  You will leave with a full stomach that wishes you hadn't eaten so much."}
{"text":"Hours later and I'm not sick. This place gets the mediocre at best award."}
{"text":"For $6.99, it is a solid lunch spot (and probably the cheapest around for chinese buffet). They have all the basic items. I particularly enjoy the spring rolls they offer here (looks like a firecracker stuffed with minced meat). Their entree choices do not all taste alike (thank goodness), and you can easily get your month's worth in 2 trips (or even 1)."}
{"text":"Still consistent and still decent, but I would say that I've experienced better. If you have a formula that works, stick to it. Since I started stopping by Dragon, the layout of the restaurant and the steam tables haven't changed. And more importantly, the food items haven't changed. They still offer a Black Pepper Pork and there are Barbecue Spare Ribs at dinner and the steamed dimsum and fried dumplings are there all day. Chicken & Broccoli and Lo Mein and such, too.  They've had a few platters of sushi - nothing more than California Rolls - occasionally.  With all of that said, there's a new player in town. Not even a mile further south is Jasmine Buffet which has more tables, better sushi and a cook-to-order hibachi grill with fresh veggies. Though it is a little more expensive there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese food places in Charlotte, although some of the dishes on the buffet aren't that great. Avoid the orange chicken and the bourbon chicken. The Vietnamese spring rolls are fantastic, although I have no idea what meat they're stuffed with - it's probably better that I don't know. They also have several really good unusual dishes, try the Malaysia chicken and the Indian chicken."}
{"text":"Good buffet food. I am a fan of their peanut chicken the most. The owner's son is very fun and even gave me some of the peanut chicken to go at the end of the night. Great prices. It is on the smaller side as far as length of buffet and maybe more social waitresses. Overall, a good Chinese buffet to go to especially for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"\"This is a 3.5\" rating. I do not like buffets of any type. My perception is always mediocre food and potential for food safety issues, not to mention the idiots with no social skills mishandling the serving utensils and sticking their fingers in the food.   I have been hard pressed to find good Chinese food in the Charlotte area and this restaurant was recommended by a friend, who knows \"buffet\" is a bad concept in my world. So, it had to be good if they went out on the limb to get me to go there.   I visit this restaurant only for lunch. I can get in and out quickly even when its crowded, which is 99% of the time.  They pack them in because the price is right. About $9.50 for the buffet, ice tea and tip.   The food quality is a pleasant surprise. I do not think anything is off the mark and they are consistent. The food taste the same every time. They definitely use high quality ingredients and overall good food is the end result. They offer many choices of chicken, shrimp and beef. Excellent soup and items for vegetarians. Great depth and breadth in their offering.  I would recommend this restaurant because of the above average price/value relationship. Very good service and nice owners. Its still a bufffffffet though!  Parking can be difficult when they are slammed. Just pull in the Home Depot lot and walk across the street for the no hassel approach."}
{"text":"I wanted Bill Spoons today, but didn't have cash and was too lazy to drive to an ATM. I'll see you next time Bill, next time. So, Chinese it was!   3.5 stars to no avail so 4 it is. Dragon Buffet isn't the greatest place, but its far from being the worst. It is though, my preferred Chinese restaurant in the Billy Graham area.   Typically, I too normally avoid Chinese buffets, less tin tin. Dragon Buffet though, is a restaurant in which I prefer the buffet. All of the dishes I've ordered off the menu here have been horrible. Orange chicken was atrocious. The sauce they use for their sweet and sour dishes taste nothing more than diluted strawberry jam. Hot and spicy beef was lacking the spicy and the flavor. So, I avoid the menu altogether and go straight to the buffet - even for my to go orders.   Their buffet offers a nice variety of items. Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and the usuals etc. but I have my favorites:  #1 is the buttered shrimp. Can't go wrong with tempura fried shrimp!  #2 is the Indonesian or Malay chicken..I think. My memory fails me worse than I failed the series 7. I forget if it was malay or indonesian and I was just there an hour ago, lol.  #3 is the fried rice. Abnormally brown as heck, not the greatest tasting and greasier than fried chicken, but dang I can't get enough of it.  #4 (kudos if you caught this earlier, lol) is the fantasy chicken. I can only eat one or two pieces though. This chicken is made in a sweet, I think mayonnaise type sauce. Very strange, and unique. It isn't the greatest, but different.   And all else, I get a sampling of the potatoes, mushrooms, and cabbage. Sometimes I get the imitation crab bake that looks like a casserole. This too has some type of sour cream or mayonnaise sauce. It is unique but isn't for everyone though.   They have been recently offering pad thai at the buffet. But the pad thai is made with clear vermicelli noodles. That should be a crime. It looks strikingly similar to a Filipino dish called pancit. In fact, it taste more like pancit than pad thai too. Skip that.   Today I also saw a new item, the shrimp biscuit. Dough stuffed with some type of shrimp and mayonnaise concoction. Different again, but I didn't like this one.   I also asked for a cup of hot oil/chili today. It was interesting. Call me crazy, but it tasted like the chili on the outside those mexican mango chili lollipops. I dunno if that's a bad thing?   To go orders at the Buffet cost $3.95 a pound. If you splurge, you might end up with a $15 dollar to go box. If you only get what you want and don't fall victim to temptation and pack a sampling of everything thats out, you can make out pretty well.   edit - service is always good here.They are very friendly and the restaurant is very clean too.   All in all, Dragon Buffet isn't the best chinese place, but I've acquired a taste for it and can't seem to get enough."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most presentable and clean dining area compared to other Chinese buffet restaurants. I will rate the physical aspect of the restaurant as 4 stars. The food tastes okay but not to a point where you will look forward to eating the same food in the near future. I'll give the food taste 3 stars. In terms of the food offered, there's not much you can select from. For the food menu and selection I give it 2 stars. But what about the $$$? I give it 5 stars. You can't complain much with $8+ dinner. Am I going to come back here? Yes why not. It's cheap!"}
{"text":"Well I'm not a big fan of Chinese food in Charlotte so most buffets don't stand a chance with me.  However, this one has some decent items on the buffet.  The restaurant is busy during the lunch hour and parking is scarce as many times you have to cross over into the Wally World parking lot.  One item that stands out on this buffet is the hot and sour soup.  I could almost bathe in this as it is one of the best soups I've had.    One suggestion for the owners is to add more spicy selections.  One of my biggest complaints about all chinese restaurants is the lack of spice.  But this place is overall ok and I do come back here once in a while."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese buffets.  My only complaint is the last time we went, there were at least 5 fish dishes and only 1 spicy dish.  They need to add more spicy.  Parking is at a premium but the service and taste make up for it."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but I have stopped going. Their ribs was my favorite, but last few times i went there some of their ribs had bites taken out of them, and they told me that is how they were. But I know better!  They do not have very much to choose from, and they have the same menu everyday.  Also the food sits there and gets dry when they are having slow business, but you know what..I pay for fresh food, I am a customer too and i do not want dried out food. So I just stopped going."}
{"text":"9.99 for Chinese food buffet style sure why not!! It's not that big of a place but hey it gets the job done! On weekends they got seafood out which are okay don't be  expecting some bomb ass seafood. BEWARE of the crush orange soda! It tastes like it has a grip load of soap in it! LOL!  They got some tv which is good I suppose to catch games and what not while you are enjoying your meal. They don't have their price listed anywhere so it was kinda weird to ask the hostess, but it's okay the foods not bad."}
