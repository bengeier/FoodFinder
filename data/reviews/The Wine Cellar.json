{"text":"I am a Chardonnay fan and they seemed to have a nice selection. I was shocked by the $3.00 glass of Chard though. I guess in my snooty wine mind the only wine I'm going to find for three dollars is Boones Farm or some equivalent. The bartender said the price is a reflection of their buying capabilities. They get it at a better price and pass it along... well in that case. KUDOS. Who doesn't like a bargain. I settled on something a little more pricey though and enjoyed my extra $4 dollars worth. The wallpaper does make me feel like I'm in Liza Minnelli's bedroom but after a few drinks .... yeah it's still a bit weird. There was live entertainment that was nice, not too loud. All in all, I would say check it out if your in Cornelius."}
{"text":"Looked good online but when we showed up, the place was very hot and they were burning scented candles. Not pleasant for enjoying a glass of wine. Needless to say we didn't stay. A shame."}
{"text":"Sophistication without pretense.  This is a delightful place to have some wine and conversation.  As another reviewer said, the owners and the excellent staff make the customers feel at home, make them feel like old friends.  For my third trip I tried the Thursday night wine tasting; the place was packed and yet you could have a conversation easily.

I make no claim to expertise on wines, but this is a very enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Great spot for wine and cheese, it's a little expensive and it can randomly close early but I always have a lot of fun when I go."}
{"text":"What I like to consider one of Charlotte's best kept secrets. We popped in while on a random night to catch some 8 string banjo jazz and loved it. Another place I wish I could transplant straight to Chicago. The vibe is amazing, the decor gorgeous and the wines all excellent. This is what a wine bar should be, please take notes DOC."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is sexy!  What a fun little gem right in Lake Norman.  Not only did I feel as if I had stepped out of the Carolina's and into a little bar in NYC, but the staff was super nice and helpful (not like NY haha) 

They offer $6 wine tastings every Thursday which is perfect for a fun weeknight escape, and have plenty of comfy couches to lounge on if you get there early enough to snag one. 

My favorite thing about the Wine Cellar though, was the perfect little menu of bar nibbles. They have hummus for $2.50 -- unheard of!  They also have these really delicious sandwiches if you are a little hungrier. My favorite is the Parisien - French Ham, Butter, and Cornichons -- just like they do in France...mmm takes me back to studying abroad in Paris! 

I can't wait to go back -- its so nice to find a classy wine bar with a non pretentious atmosphere and a great staff. Vive la France!"}
{"text":"Great swanky little place!
Nice atmosphere, long bar area, tables, and couch/lounge area, a good place to hang out.  
I LOVE champagne, and they always have a good selection (a lot more higher end options, which brings me to the fact I really wish they had more affordable options or more splits on the menu). 

They are adding more food to their menu which is really exciting- I love the cheese plates, but haven't tried dessert or the sandwiches yet. I will soon for sure. 
The decor is really cool and I love the Euro-Lounge type music they play. 
There is often live music on the weekends, like jazz, but I'm more of an electronic music fan so I'd prefer the ipod, just personal opinion. The owner is also really nice and energetic. 
I would like if they offered wine and cheese pairing flights or some sort of multi-course appetizer menu thing.
The wine/beer selection is enormous and the knowledgable staff make it a fun place to go. And I really dig the wallpaper."}
{"text":"Great place!  Great wine. $7 wine tasting every Thursday evening. And the bottle prices are good. Great wine at reasonable prices. And the owner is great too."}
{"text":"I like this little spot!  Was recently disappointed when the advertised entertainment didn't show. Strange that they didn't seem to know why. The just kept saying she was late. I guess mix-ups will happen--right? I am sure I will be back. Maybe the second Wednesday of the month...check it out!"}
{"text":"It has been a few weeks since I had an opportunity to get to The Wine Cellar.  First, it is great to have a nice cozy, comfortable place to go and have a bottle/glass of wine.  The wine bar attendant was very attentive and provided great recommendation based on my wife's brief description of what she wanted to drink.  \"Red, full-bodied, fruit-forward!\"  Just that simple!  And the two recommendations were fantastic.  My first taste of recommendation #1, convinced me that I did not need to try #2.  But as it turned out...both were fantastic and I have since added a few bottles to the TCB Cellar at home!  In addition to the great wines, were able to hear some good live jazz.  The performer was very good!  I look forward to returning to the Wine Cellar...and will sit at a table so that we can actually see the performance.  Don't get me wrong, sitting at the bar provided a great opportunity to talk about the wines and other offerings at the Wine Cellar.  I look forward to one day seeing some incentives on wine purchases...on some of their specialty items that seemed a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great intimate atmosphere, dim lighting, great bottle selection. The staff is great and very knowledgeable on the wine and also the food and cheese pairing selections. 
I usually go for the wine and local beer but I actually tried the Parisien the last time I was there and I was very impressed, the taste was authentic and although i'm not the biggest cornichons fan, it blended perfectly with the bread and butter."}
{"text":"Joi de vivre... Culture, communication, conviviality... All this and more nestled in a cozy atmosphere with warm and generous hosts. Incredible you say? Unlikely in this leetle town? Not so, say I. You can see and feel that Alex and Alain love what they do and have that rare magic that compresses time. A short visit and you feel as if you have known them for years. 

As a sommelier, I can say they have a healthy selection of wines that cover everyone's tastes from modest to grandiose. My intentions upon my first visit were simple. Walk in, look around, sample a quick glass of the fruit of the vine and dash... Instead, a metamorphisis occurred. I enjoyed a magnificent three hour conversation that saw a fine Napa Cab put to rest... Do yourself a favor and support a worthy local business. Oh and practice a little of that French you studied so long ago.... Abientot!"}
{"text":"The best \"wine\" bar in the area. This is not some beer bar that had wine. You will not find bud or other redneck beers. This place has a classy selections of wines. Alex and Alain have done an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start with the wine/beer selection. Excellent selection and reasonably priced. Great service as well. Cute decor and ample seating despite size of the place. 4 stars for the wine. The food, however, 2 stars. Don't come here hungry. It's a poor representation of french food, plus the name is 'wine cellar' so you get the picture."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a date or friends get together around the LKN area. The wine selection is superb, also has a pretty good bottled beer selection.  Their wine tastings on Thursday evenings are a great deal with selections from around the globe. Great sandwiches, cheese plates, Free WiFi, live music and phenomenal staff wrap up the 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Wine Cellar a few times for a tasting or a glass with friends. The owner is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, he even remembered me the 2nd time. Prices are very reasonable and it is obvious that they do not skimp on quality."}
{"text":"The dim lighting, the constant chatter and music make for a romantic and upbeat wine nook! When I lived near Davidson I went pretty often. One night they had a great guitarist playing. On the other nights their playlists was pretty rockin too! While the wine selection is awesome they could work on their appetizers a little. The French bread was very crumbly and not French-bready at all! Other than that, grab your friends or your boo and head on over."}
{"text":"Awesome place. great wine.  nice to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"One of the things I hate about Lake Norman is the total lack of good restaurants.  I try to find cool coffee shops or cafes to get work down and I\"m always disappointed.

I was waywardly walking through the parking lot and I talked myself into simply giving in to Starbucks when suddenly I ran into The Wine Celler.  I was the only person in the restaurant but to be fair it was 3:00PM.  The owner greeted me with a big \"Bonjour\" and suggested the Ham Sandwich.  It was a great choice.  The ham was very fresh and high quality.  I was a little surprised and asked where it was from.  

The owner proudly told me that all the meats are imported and fresh.  The baguette was exactly the way it should be...crispy and soft.  Very authentic and tasty. 

I ended up ordering another sandwich to go.  This is a great find in a sea of restaurant misery."}
{"text":"Great wine selection, personable staff, live music, and high quality menu ingredients.  Wine is half price by the glass on Mondays and selected bottles are under $20 on Wednesdays.  It isn't uncommon for there to be live music, local artists, or other LKN community collaboration at Wine Cellar.  Best of all, the owner Alain and bartenders Jeremie and Elizabeth truly care about their patrons.  They take the time to get to know you and have conversation if you are open to it.  Simply fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood Wine Bar, easy to get to, friendly owner and staff...\"Everyone likes the Wine Cellar\"..."}
{"text":"I visited the Wine Cellar last week while waiting on a friend. I give this location three stars because the wine I ordered from the menu of wine by the glass is no longer offered by the glass. The bartender did have a recommendation for me to try that would be just as bold as what I initially chose. I was very happy with the recommended selection and will return here again if I am in the neighborhood.

PS--I love the walls! They are super fun and the texture gives a great dimension."}
{"text":"I am so impressed by the service, food and wine. Best variety of wine from everywhere. The sandwiches are so good and my favorite is the big cheese plate. Alain and his team are amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cozy place to have some great wine, look no further.  Super cozy with elegant decor and great owners and staff.  They have been voted best wine selection by the readers of Lake Norman Currents Magazine.  Every Thursday night they have a wine tasting that starts at 7pm for $6 and you get a discount if you buy bottles from the tasting...a great way to find new favorites.  Lately, I have enjoyed starting with a prosecco & then a glass of a yummy red (I mix it up each time).  

They have free wifi and open at 2pm on weekdays, so bring the laptop and work from here then enjoy wine when you're done (or why wait?).  They also have a food menu with hummus, various cheese & meat plates, baguettes (pain & buerre- yum!), sandwiches & more.  Oh, how could I almost forget to mention the MACAROONS...get some!!

They host weekly events and play on themes of current events or the entertainment buzz so check out their website often.  If you need a place to host a business event or networking event, this is a great spot & they welcome groups (just call ahead).

Enjoy an intimate glass with a loved one, host a business meeting or bring the party with your friends.  They will accommodate all scenarios perfectly.  

Salute!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and cheese plates. Probably one of the best hidden wine bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Someone said \"this place is sexy\" ...That is exactly what I thought...The decor and ambiance was right on. The wine/food/music is lovely. The rif raff (if you know what I mean)  has no place here. Its a nice place to sit and enjoy a bottle or two of wine with great company."}
{"text":"I LOVE The Wine Cellar. The atmosphere is wonderful and there is always something going on there every night of the week.  Live music, wine tastings that change every week and the tasting is so reasonable with a nice healthy pour so you can really taste the wine. 
The Wine Cellar is good for meetings for business, girlfriend night out, date night or just to pop in and relax after a long day.
The staff is amazing and the owner is always on sight to help with a wine or food selection. I highly recommend this hidden Lake Norman gem!!!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. I can't remember why we stopped in but the owner is really nice and I love the tasting cards. I  thought the emails were a bit much but glad to have gotten one as we stopped in and got a real bargain on the best wine I have had in a long time. The card which you load with money allows you to taste a variety of wine before purchasing. I look forward to doing a tasting one night. The place does not look like much the the people are really nice. I think if they softened it up a bit more for the cosy feel they make get more people to pop in.  Maybe some soft chairs and tables like in a french tasting room. Just so people are not just standing around the pouring machines. Just a thought"}
{"text":"At long last, I was able to visit The Wine Cellar with the hubs (Nicole's word).  The atmosphere is cozy but not private.  If you sit on one of the comfy sofas, you get to look at other patrons.  In any case, when you're having a glass of vino (or a bottle), who cares!  The staff was excellent and recommended a very nice red blend that was not yet on the menu.  I give the wine 5/5. After tasting, it was definitely a winner.  I will give the  cheese tray 3/5; it was okay.  Some of the cheese were not favorable with the wine selection.  More visits to this local establishment are definitely in order, especially on a lazy evening. The place grew more crowded as the evening wore on.  If you are visiting with friends, arrive early evening to secure a few tables, or the sitting area in the middle."}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this little gem in Lake Norman. What a great place to chill with friends and co- workers after work. Loved the service and wine selection. I deducted a star for the horrible live music. The amateur acoustic guitar player was very distracting."}
