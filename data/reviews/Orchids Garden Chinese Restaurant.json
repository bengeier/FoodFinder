{"text":"Delicious, cheap, the food keeps on coming. The shrimp balls and custard cakes are amazing."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get dim sum in town! My boyfriend and I come here frequently for the fast and polite service. The quality of food is among the most consistent I have ever experienced and they set the bar high. The owners take notice of their regulars and acknowledge them by remembering favorite dishes. The environment is comfortable, and if you listen carefully you will hear arranged Final Fantasy music playing on the speakers. I recommend this place for anyone who enjoys dim sum or if you want to try out something new!"}
{"text":"Solid dim sum at Orchids Garden.  Being from San Francisco, I know my dim sum expectations are unreasonably high... but this place is legit.  Prices are a little higher than in the city where there are more ds options, but that's expected.  Mad props for serving all day dim sum, although not everything on the carts is piping hot if you come during an off time.  They have all the staples here, but you sometimes have to ask if you don't see your favs on the carts.  Shrimp puffs w/ scallions, sesame balls, shu mai, & sugar cane shrimp are some of my favs.  Delicious sweet cream buns (aka pineapple buns), worth the trip alone if you get them hot.  Love that they have noodles on the carts so that less adventurous eaters have a staple they don't need to order off the menu and wait for.  There always seems to be someone in my group who is super grateful for those noodles!  Definitely my go-to spot for dim sum, but I'd recommend coming during prime time (usually 11am on weekends and lunch or din time during the week) for the freshest selection, otherwise your experience might be more of a 2 or 3 star scenario."}
{"text":"Went for the first time a couple days ago.  My aunt lives in Vegas and recommended the place.  Overall the place was good, not the best dim sum ever, but pretty good.  Took a party of 7; half had never eaten this type of Chinese food, but they really liked it.  A couple really good things; 1) they serve dim sum all day not just morning/lunch time; you can get chow mein off the cart in individual sizes vs. having to order a huge plate.  Cart service was pretty quick and came by often, wait service was slow.  Paid $71 plus tip for 7 people.  When in Vegas again, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ordered many dishes, and no dish stood out because everything was too salty. There is no other flavor except salt, salt, salt. Everything was also extremely greasy and coated in oil. BEWARE, they also charge an automatic 17% service fee and don't tell you about it."}
{"text":"Good food...but won't return because they sell shark fin items. And I don't believe in finning a shark and because I don't know how it was harvested (properly or not) I won't be returning to eat there."}
{"text":"This is a 24h dim sum.  All the dishes were hot and on point.  They had a good selection of very reasonably priced items. Each cart contains items at at a certain price ranging from $2 for pork buns up to $6 for salt and pepper shrimp.  Great dim sum experience."}
{"text":"Our uncle brought us to Orchids.  This place has a very good variety of dim sum.  You don't have wait forever like some of the other places for the carts to come around.  For Vegas, it's pretty good!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Dim sum from open to close... which isn't till 10:30pm! GENIUS!!!"}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant that dares to defy traditional lunchtime dim sum hours!  They have the typical offerings like shu mai, har gow, and chicken feet, but the real kicker is that they have it all day!  For the most part, their food is tasty and filling for a low price. Go ahead, indulge in the char siu bao and sesame balls! Just note that the har gow and shrimp wrapped in rice noodle stick together and are scantily filled. Besides the portion size, another issue is that some of the dishes can be bland.  The vast, clean dining space accommodates both the diners and the little old Chinese ladies pushing their metal carts. These carts sure make their rounds quick! Pretty sure the same lady made a few laps before we ordered something from her cart. Plenty of parking is found in the front and back of the building. I like that there's room to maneuver around in and out of the restaurant, because it gets claustrophobic at Chang's.  The portions and flavor could be improved, but Orchids Garden is pretty decent for dim sum in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was honestly really bad chinese food. The rice was mushy, the crab wagons had nothing inside of them, and the chicken didn't taste like chicken. I ordered orange chicken and it tasted nothing like it. I do NOT recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Food here is great i love it. I have been coming here for the past year. I am finally writing a review because I have had it with their nasty service. Horrible horrible horrible! I understand they don't speak English. I ask for water, they JUST TURN AROUND. You ask for anything, they give you the dirty look and not respond to anything. AT THE VERY LEAST SAY YES OR NO!!! I'm sorry but your service is disgusting."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Dim Sum.  Busy place, which keeps the food fresh and the carts moving.  Very reasonably priced, as dim sum should be.  Flavor and freshness on the bakery stuff was just as good as on the savory fish and vegetable choices (I don't eat meat other than seafood).    Great way to start a weekend day."}
{"text":"Came here once on my last trip to LV. My sister and I were craving dim sum, so we took a ride to this restaurant even though there were other choices. The food was okay. I'm not sure if it's because we got there late for dim sum, but some things were hot while others were warm. We also ordered a Pan fried noodles and it was a little salty for my liking. Not the best dim sum I've had but not the worst either. I would be down to give them another shot if I'm craving dim sum in LV again."}
{"text":"I love Orchids. The only other dim sum place I've been to in Las Vegas was Ping Pang Pong.. and they were pretty good but expensive.  Anyway, went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. It was about 1pm and it was actually quite empty. We got seated, and right away, the ladies are coming around with their carts full of delicious dim sum. I have the hardest time ordering stuff here because in Hawaii, we call everything by a different name! Its so confusing! haha.  We ordered: Chicken Char-siu Bao (manapua!) - I thought it was good, they are mini and the filling wasn't char-siu but it was some sort of chicken.  Shrimp Half moon - I really don't know what the chinese name of this is, but in Hawaii we call it half moon.  Pork Hash - They were small but I thought they were kind of oily.. but good! Shrimp Rolls: I call it look fun back home, but none of the ladies knew what the eff we were talking about. It is the shrimps wrapped with a sheet of rice paper with shoyu type sauce poured all over it. This is my favorite thing to order.  Eggplant w/Shrimp Paste: This was kind of cold by the time we got it, but it was ok. I ordered the bellpepper stuffed with this paste previously.. but I like the eggplant one better.  The service is quick. If it is not too busy, the ladies will come up to you every single time they come around.. even if you said you didn't want what was on their cart. We had to ask a few times for the shrimp rolls in the flat rice noodle, after about the 3rd time asking, the lady went to find that cart and brought the dish to us.   After about 6 plates, out bill was under $20. I've been wanting to try some other dim sum places.. but I like Orchids because its a big space and the dim sum is pretty good."}
{"text":"Roaches...more than one on more than one occasion.  Rude service, more than once and I saw the kitchen - dirty, need I say more.  Find your Dim Sum somewhere else!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing and we are regulars here   the dim sum is THE BEST in las vegas!  try these:   pan fried chive dumpling  fried sugar cane w/ shrimp paste shrimp in rice noodle roll  shrimp har gow  fried shrimp puff w/ crispy noodles steamed bbq pork bun  fried sesame ball (red bean paste)   these are SO GOOD!    dim sum is available 7 days a week - it is authentic - they push carts constantly offering fresh dim sum - they come back often   very good customer service   very friendly staff   quick service   go - try - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I grew up and lived in Los Angeles most of my life, so when it comes to Dim Sum, I admit to being a bit spoiled. For me, the bar has been set quite high by the variety and quality of Dim Sum available just east of LA.  Because of that and because I am realistic about living in a relatively provincial town compared to Los Angeles, I am willing to judge accordingly and be less critical.   I have been to Orchid's Garden many times and it's usually passable Dim Sum. I've never walked out of there thinking, \"Wow, that was kick ass\".  That said, I was just glad that at least I could get some Dim Sum here in Las Vegas, albeit mediocre.    I don't like writing bad reviews of restaurants, but I'm afraid that my last visit necessitates some serious venting. I actually left this dump feeling pissed off. There is almost nothing worse than seriously craving good Chinese food then having an absolutely crappy meal. In a way, it's like having sex and ending with a mistimed lackluster orgasm.    It was partially my fault for having the temerity of eating at 4:30 in the afternoon. The place was fairly empty and only one sad lukewarm cart was being wheeled about.  Dim Sum is best when a place is overflowing with ravenous customers and hot steaming carts are careening about at the hands of hostile Chinese women who recoil at the thought of serving Gringos.  Oh, wait, I take that back. They were a little rancorous.  Everything we picked from the cart was room temperature at best. The selection was old, oily and diminutive.  With a little imagination, one might wonder if this is what Dim Sum is like when served in socialist Venezuela where people engage in small skirmishes just to get a loaf of bread.    When I finally flagged down the waitress to get our check, I actually got very Gordon Ramsey on her and said, \"You should be embarrassed to serve crap like that.\" My bitchy comment was returned with a blank, couldn't-give-a-shit, stare.   Four of us in my party vowed to never go back. It was simply terrible. What a shame. Fortunately none of us got sick."}
{"text":"Good price and best when busy, carts keep coming. Have had some cold shrimp but over all they do a good job"}
{"text":"I think this place is the best dimsum in the area, prices are great too. I recommend the chive dumpling, shumai, and shrimp puff. Go for the chicken feet if you feel daring!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum here is amazing! The ladies come by with their carts as soon as you sit down. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! Take the time and try something new.  It may seem like small amounts of food but it fills you up quick. Your eyes can easily get your stomach in trouble here!"}
{"text":"Place is good because of the all day dim sum. Good number of choices but not the best quality. The service was good constantly cleaning plates and coming around with new choices. Overall a solid meal nothing spectacular"}
{"text":"Excellent service, dim sum, & custard-filled desserts!  Open till 10:30 too!  The employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice Dimsum and Chinese fast food. I really love the HK style. Everytime i come to LasVegas i always here. Price is resonable not so expensive."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I've ever eaten.. My husband and I came here after seeing such good reviews posted here on yelp. We were both in the mood for trying some tasty dim sum and it sounded like a good idea... until we got here. We grabbed a couple of dishes to start. It doesn't matter what they were cause here is what is important they were all cold, stale, and didn't even appear appetizing. Needless to say, we didn't grab anything else. Oh and the worst part, as soon as I got home I felt stomach sick and had to throw up. That never happens. This place is a disaster.  Please save yourself from food-borne illnesses and paying to eat frankenfood. I would have rather eaten a hundred booger flavored jellybellys. It was that bad."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum I've had in Las Vegas! Very clean restaurant and great service, and the food was absolutely delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Umm, where should I begin.  Well, I stopped by this place for lunch on Saturday while I was in Vegas.  The food was so so, and the variety of dim sum is very very limited.  Service is sh.t, they just keep checking your dim sum ticket to see if you are ready to go and get you the check.  Anyway, look for somewhere else if you are craving for dim sum."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday for dinner.  Saw the best in Las Vegas sign and do we decided to stop.  Prices-ok.  Selection-seen better at other dim sum places in Vegas. Flavor-had better at other dim sum places in Vegas. Service-good and friendly. Don't order the Cheong Fun.  It was thick. The Char Siew Pow was not bad.  Could have more meat it in. The Har Gau was not good. Small and shrimp was pasty. The beef ball was good.  Tan Tat was ok.  To thick of flacky crust not enough egg. Fung Chow and Pai Kuat was ok. Overall, it was ok.  Would not go back.  The reviewer for the best dim sum in Vegas obviously don't know what true \"Yum Tsa\" is in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"The dimsum was good but it made me sick not to mention the rudeness of the cashier.  I went there to get food to go and the wait was ridiculous. Could not understand why considering they didn't have to cook anything and the cashier was so freaking rude not to mention it really made me so sick. Don't think will go back there again. Rude!  Ping pang pong from now on for us!  No more orchids garden for us ever!!  Typical Chinese service!"}
{"text":"Had Dim Sum in Hong Kong, drove by here and had to stop in. Ordered Shumai, BBQ pork buns (both baked and steamed), and various other dishes and all were excellent.   The taro and the baked pork buns were really wonderful. You order from carts, and it is a fun, delicious way to have lunch.   The staff was friendly and service was very good."}
{"text":"Not bad dim sum at all. Went to this place for dinner. Not a fancy dim sum place but if you're hungry and craving for cantonese food this restaurant will do it!  Service was ok and carts came pretty fast as we sat down, especially since the place wasn't packed."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was terrible. There was some communication problems. And mind you its 3pm and not busy at all. Probably 3 tables including us. Sorry we did not tip. Probably not going back."}
{"text":"Really good Dim Sum...definitely the best I've had in Las Vegas.  This isn't a five star restaurant, but it is a five star Dim Sum joint.    Simple and fresh"}
{"text":"Serve authentic dim sum menu. Pork shumai was excellent as well as chicken feet. Serves a variety of authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"If you are craving dim sum, this is the place to go!  Orchids garden is always a wonderful place to eat and they serve dim sum all day seven days a week.   We come here every time we are in Vegas.  We especially enjoy the Shu Mai, Hargow ( shrimp balls) and the eggplant with shrimp.  My companion raved about the red been sesame balls, I personally did not try them but they look delicious.  As soon as you sit down, there is a cart or two on its' way to start filling you up.    The carts come around frequently and are always being replenished with the goodies they serve. It doesn't take long for you to find your favorite dish on a dim sum cart.    Everything tasted very very fresh and we all enjoyed our meal.  You can tell all of the dishes are made with quality ingredients.   The restaurant is huge but they have the staff to give everyone great service.  They also have space for large parties or groups.    Centrally located, you can access Orchids Garden via cab from the Las Vegas strip or if you happen to live in town it's right on Sahara , west of the strip."}
{"text":"I actually quite like Orchids Garden. Last time we had to wait for a long time for a table, but this time, even though there were a bunch of people waiting, my wife walked up to the front and next thing I knew we were being seated. Just as well because I could tell my wife was super hungry and it did well for them to seat us immediately.  The place was packed and the carts rolled around and soon we had bbq pork buns on the table along with other things. Everything was good. I mean it's not San Francisco good, but out of all the places we've been to in Vegas, this one is better than the rest.  By the time we finished, the crowd was so big it was hard to get out the door. My wife joked that the food must be free for them since she would not wait that long if she's hungry. We were satisfied and it was very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I love coming here for dimsum. They have a great staff and the food is great. The prices are not bad niether about $80 for 11 people you can't beat that. I would definatly reccomend this place"}
{"text":"Not to bad, I may think about going back to this place. The only item that tasted a little foul was the calamari."}
{"text":"Howzit!?  Very average Dim Sum.   Decent service.  Notable dishes: Sauteed Chicken Feet, Mini Custard Tarts."}
{"text":"They have decent dim sum, but the regular menu items are only acceptable.  Location is good and easy parking."}
{"text":"Most of the Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas serving dim-sum are pretty good. Quality at most of them seems to never quite constant. I was told many of the dim-sum chefs do not stay at one place too long; or staying in Las Vegas too long (too much temptation from gambling). We like the Orchids Garden because they serve dim-sum all day. Wish they would fit the parking lot at the back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the better dim-sum, but it's definitely not the greatest.  The service is not that good. When we were seated at our table, the waitress just plopped our water glasses on the table and walked away. The dim-sum servers just take things too seriously. It's not like we're going to eat everything!   Now the food was good, but not delicious. The shu-mai and the spare ribs were some of my favorites. The har-gow was also OK. If you want something a little more \"weird\", try the chicken feet or the tripe. It's relatively clean and sanitary.  A stereotype dim-sum restaurant where the food is decent and the dim-sum servers take it too seriously. I would try some other dim-sum restaurants before trying Orchid's."}
{"text":"We live nearby and go here often. Great good and fast service.  They could use a remodel job but I guess it's typical Chinese. My favorite is the Peking Duck."}
{"text":"To be fair, the dim sum at this place is fine.  However, the service is getting less and less impressive.    On our last visit there, the waitress was just rude.  We were in the middle of our meal and there were still plates with dim sum on the table.  Suddenly the waitress came by and took our plates and chopsticks away.  We suspected that they wanted to clean up the table and got rid of us since there were someone waiting to be seated.  Even though, we told her that we were not done and please gave us a few more minutes.  The waitress still came by many times within the next few minutes and tried to clean up EVERYTHING on the table.  She took my son's bowl while he was still eating from that particular bowl.  She also took our dim sum check along the way and did not care if we might order more.  We don't see why she could not leave us alone and gave us a few more minutes just to finish our meal  We were very dissatisfied with our last visit.  This restaurant made us felt very unwelcome.  We don't think we will go back again, even though we used to stop by each time we visited Vegas in the past.  I would give it 4 stars in the past when service was descent,  However, I must take away 3 stars after our bad experience just last week."}
{"text":"Good dim sum. Great lobster. Come early to get a table for dim sum. It gets crowded fast."}
{"text":"I found this place online with pretty good reviews. However, coming from the bay area, I had high expectations. It turned out the food wasn't very good. I'm sure the food had MSG as I was feeling thirsty after eating. However, being in the middle of the desert, it's difficult to find good dim sum place. I'd give them credit for trying."}
{"text":"Our party of 3  stopped for a late lunch on a Saturday.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  The carts came around often and there was a large selection. The only negative was that some of the workers pushing the carts were almost impossible to understand when explaining what they had to offer.  We spent a lot of time saying \"What?\""}
{"text":"Arrived on Saturday at 1:22 pm.  Had to wait at least 10 mins for the steamers to come around.  Unlike others' experience, they did not come that often after that.  Quality and flavor is on par with others in the city.  Sweet Tofu is gingery, which i love; tofu is way tender, which i do not.  For my money, i'm going to chang's next time."}
{"text":"Loved it. Good service, a lot of carts coming through. Decent selection, although that could be better but everything I had was really good. The cost is reasonable too, two of us ate until we couldn't eat any more and it was about $35. Very busy in there so there is a lot of turn over of food and tables = freshness. I had the cream bun for dessert which was excellent, crusty on the outside but soft and creamy sweet goodness on the inside. Also, had the bbq steamed bun, chinese broccoli, eggplant, shrimp balls and a number of other things that I can't remember but everything we had was great."}
{"text":"This morning decided to take my Mom from HI , and Brother visiting from San Antonio, tx to Orchids our favorite dim sum restaurant in LV. This might b a vague review , I'm sorry but most of the dim sum we ordered I have no idea what the nameswere, just point at what looks good and hope it's not offals.            The char siu bao both steamed and baked very good , the fillings in both were perfect both flavor and texture.           They had alot of shrimp dishes , shrimp stuffed eggplant, tofu and in sheet noodles. We also had the shrimp ball on sugar cane.  The lotus leaf wrapped rice w/ pork was tasty . Mom loved the turnip cake I think that's what it was.. We had alot of other dim sum that were very good , in general everything tasted good .                Service was good, not as pushy as other yelpers experienced, carts came around quickly. We really enjoyed ourselves , i don't think u can go wrong here , we've been here maybe a dozen times and we still come back ."}
{"text":"First experience with a dim sum type restaurant.  Loved it!  Very friendly and attentive staff.  If you don't speak chinese, don't keep asking the servers \"what?\", or \"huh?\"  You have to try and figure out what they're saying via observation. Food seemed pretty fresh.  Even had the chicken feet. Not gonna have it again, but give me props for trying.  The other items, especially the vegetable dumpling, were great. Will come back."}
{"text":"This is not the best dim sum in the world, but it is my favorite in Las Vegas. I've had dim sum from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Canada, Seattle and other areas and this place is not bad in comparison. Its tasty and price is reasonable. The only downside is with typical dim sum place is the queue when you arrive late. Be there at 10.30am and you will be served instantly. Arrive at 12pm and you may have to wait more than 30 min depending on the weekend. Since they serve dimsum all day long, I went and tried one time in the evening. You have to order from the menu, and the variety is not as good as the brunch. The taste is a bit off too, kind of expected. I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"Gross!  Cockroach sitting right on the table!  Never coming back."}
{"text":"I just moved here in vegas and my friend and my boyfriend decided to go for a dimsum and we found this place here on yelp, the seats are empty maybe like 10-15 people or less, so i ordered pork shumai and i also ordered beef ball the shumai is actually good it was very tasty, so when i tried the beef ball it tastes nasty like its been out for more than an hour, the taste i really couldnt explain it in details but it taste like wood, mold its like mix taste i ate the whole thing and just keep dipping it to the soy sauce but unfortunately didnt work. So i leave the two pieces in the mini steamer bowl. I asked the lady (she has like a dora hair cut) if she can take it back she said, sorry but u order it i cant do anything. I was super disappointed it was really really gross, so i told my boyfriend this will be the first and last and i didnt left any tip coz i was so disgusted and she was very rude to us from the very beginning."}
{"text":"The great thing about dim sum is instant gratification. They walk around showing you their various appetizers, you see a dish that you like and you order it. No waiting, no guessing. This is a great place for dimsum. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from and their food quality has always been consistent. I have been going here for years. Overall experience is excellent and service is friendly considering that you have to use sign and body language to communicate with them. If you want a quiet &romantic meal though I would recommend that you pick a different place."}
{"text":"Food taste great! I recommend the place for take out only.     Bad part: do not bring a big group with you because it has poor services from water, condiments and getting attention of the waiter. You will embarrass yourself bringing your friends there to eat.  Really very poor services ... bring cash cuz they expect tip if you have a big party. Please note:  Heads up worst service ever!  The restaurant attract customers  because how the food taste but have limited employees as in limited in amount of employees and mind on how to better serve their patron.  ONLY If their services were great,  I do not mind tippling  minimum 20 percent of more.   Lol! This Restaurant have the nerve to charge automatic tip and had already attached 17 percent tip on my party because the restaurant  know they have bad customers services even though the waiter do not deserve it... Seriously.  If they are going to put service charge for a party of nine.  Please provide a decent services seriously please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My fav dim sum spot in Vegas.  Easy to get to, park and get seated.  Food is consistently good.  Easy on the wallet too."}
{"text":"Having grown up in San Francisco, I realize that our options for good Chinese food in Las Vegas are pretty limited. I'm happy with Orchids Garden. I enjoy the food here from shrimp options to the noodles. The service is decent here although I'll admit that the service is better when I go with my Chinese mother as opposed to my husband or friends. I love their ALL DAY dim sum which is totally unusual but perfect for my late-in-the-day dim sum cravings."}
{"text":"So, as we walk into Orchids Gardens, my friend tells me that this particular location has been shut down several times by the health department, and then has re-branded itself several times.  My response?  Well they must have their act together now.  We were sat promptly in the vast room at a large round table.  A server came by immediately and offered us drinks and then we were bombarded by a line of waitresses sling all kinds of food items of a plastic encased rolling gueridon.  A lot of times, we couldn't understand what they were selling, but we tried it anyway, cause we were feeling adventurous.    One overwhelming factor in my poor experience was the temperature of the food.  Out of the ten items we received, one was hot, three were luke warm, and six were cold.  The flavors and textures were decent, but it was pretty hard to get past the temperature issue.     Maybe i'll com back and try ordering off the menu, but for now, thumbs down."}
{"text":"Dim Sum and then some...  I have been searching for some \"community\" tradition in Vegas where most everything is about the tourist and those of us who actually live here kind of get lost in the fray.   Well, I think I have found my little bit of togetherness on a Sunday at Orchid's Garden. Very crowded, very loud and bursting with energy.   Trolley pushing ladies running from corner to corner of a packed dinning room make it a bit hard to hear about the selections. So, my friends and I are not sure what to call everything we ate. Everything we ate tasted lovely, especially the custard rolls---yum we had to get seconds.   It was not the cleanest nor the most upscale decorated but it gives a little tone of hominess."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Las Vegas for dim sum IMHO.  Four people can eat all they want for $20 -$30.  Even the staff is friendly!  Plenty of parking out front and it's usually full of Asians - a good sign.  I've checked out virtually all the other dim sum in Vegas and this is the best deal.  I have no connection to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We live in Vegas part of the year and this is our fave for dim sum, great taste, great price, great service.  And of course, food arrives right as you sit down, which is awesome when you are hungry."}
{"text":"Dim Sum was mediocre, some dishes were cold. The taste was okay not great. Inside looks a bit dirty and out dated. Not a whole lot of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place out for lunch.   We are originally from Hawaii and to find a place that does DIM SUM for lunch in Vegas is worth a try.   All the items delivered to the table were hot and fresh, however we were kind of turned off by the aggressive waitresses.   The circle the room and despite your table being full of plates, they still try to push more food on you.   Can't say this is the best we have had , because we have had much better.  VERY PRICEY, we will not be going back.  Overall ok but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get to eat anything here today. My plan today was to get some dim sum for the first time. I had read reviews about it here and though the Orchids Garden would be my first time Dim sum experience. I read that they had takeout and thought \"that's great!\". So I went in today around 1:30pm to order some. This is where it started to turn sour for me. When I entered I asked the four waitresses waiting at the register if they had takeout. One waitress automatically pointed at the stack of menu's at the other end of the counter. My thoughts were \"OK, there are four of you, one is handling some customers paying for her food and the others are just standing there. Couldn't one of them just hand me a menu instead of me just having to make a wide berth around the customers to grab one?\".    I didn't say anything but just went went around the other customers and got the menu they pointed out. The menu was for regular Chinese food that I could get anywhere with those prices. There was no dim sum listed. I remembered from reading about this restaurant on Yelp that they must have a dim sum menu. There were no dim sum menu's around the counter, and I didn't get a chance to ask because the same counter people (whom were still just standing there not doing anything) were still focused on the customer they were billing. I'm sure if I waved a brightly colored flag they still wouldn't see me. So I just left, paper menu still in hand.  I really don't know if I'll go back there.  I may just have my Dim Sum experience someplace else. Two stars to this place for at least getting in and seeing the menu."}
{"text":"Yikes! Health Dept. Shut it down. Infestation of Roaches, and Filthy. Stay Away!!!! No place to enjoy Dim Sum that hasn't been shut down by the health dept."}
{"text":"Orchids serves dim sum all day. It was a disappointment. We were there around 8 pm.  Everything we had was cold and old. They should just stick with dim sum in the afternoon just like other dim sum restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is awful I don't know why the ratings are so high. The service is bad. The food is filled with MSG. My lips are burning as I finished my food. All their offerings are nothing special. The food is not high-quality. Nothing else to comment except don't go here."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good place for dimsum, nothing special; the price is quite expensive for dimsum."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how much I love this place. The food is excellent and the service wonderful. My husband and I have returned to this place a number of times recently and would guess that their service is better than most dim sum places. The dining room is large enough to accommodate multiple carts that return often tempting you to eat more or get extras to take home which is what we usually do. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give 1 star.  Service was horrible, nobody came to take out order. Dim sum cart kept on skipping us, 4 times not once or twice. We sat there with nothing but water glasses."}
{"text":"This is a regular visit for me when I'm in Las Vegas.  Large variety, lots of carts, priced right, and the food tastes great.  Some of the servers are very English-challenged, but there are many others willing to assist.  The chicken feet are some of the best I've had.  Always fresh, hot, and tasty.  The shau mai are also very good, but they seem smaller than other places."}
{"text":"I honestly think the best dim sum in the world. You must try the sticky rice, crab balls and shrimp balls. Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"OK, so this is not PF Chang so don't expect American standard customer service... This is a REAL Chinese joint where servers speak very little English, but food is also REAL Chinese/authentic, not panda-express kinda BS, so who cares if those old ladies were a bit rude. What did we have over there... Shark fin dumplings were definitely the hit. Chinese Broccoli, Ha Gow, Siu Mai, Shrimp Balls, Sticky Rice, and Congee. Probably the best in Vegas, it's open all day so I will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good.  The shrimp cheung fun is tasty.   They seem to run out of certains dishes by mid afternoon which seem silly if they serve dim sum all day.  I guess the early bird gets the best dim sum choices.   Service is mediocre like most chinese restaurants.  You could get death by dim sum cart if your not careful during busy times.  Atmosphere is noisy like any dim sum joint.  Overall I give them 4 stars for the variety and goodness of the dim sum."}
{"text":"This place is gross. The food was bland, not hot when brought out, super greesy and horrible service. Typical chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great. Me and my roomates come here once in a while to get that \"itis\" and have not been disappointed yet. One of my favorite items is a sweet bread roll thats an orange color, and also has an orange filling and topped of with it as well. I cant remember what its actually called but I have dubbed this item simply \"Christmas\" because thats what it taste like, a delicious Christmas morning."}
{"text":"Good food, we had dim sum short ribs. They were fatty but everything else was great.  The steamed shrimp was really good."}
{"text":"so this time, i decided to go to another location for dim sum b/c of my recent experience at another restaurant.  its the only chinese- themed structured restaurant on sahara blvd and its HUGE.  right when i drove up to the parking lot, it was full, but luckily there was parking in the back.  inside, two rooms on the left and right were packed with people, a huge variety, and a major portion chinese (Cantonese)...according to my adorable companion.  i wanted to be in the main room b/c i can see all the silver carts filled with colorful food items frantically moving around the tables.  the smells and sights made me so hungry. for some odd reason everytime they filled our teapot, they would not close it well, so i kept spilling tea out from the top.  the basic steam items were ok.  i do have to say my favorite chicken feet  in black bean sauce was hella tasty.  the chinese broccoli drowned in oyster was alright, how do you go wrong with that?  they did have shanghai dumplings, but the skin was a bit thick and took away the flavor of the meat inside.  they did have my favorite shark fin dumpling soup with the vinegar, but i was told that the shark fin that i have always thought to be in this dish was sometimes replaced with glass noodles...is it b/c im not chinese???   otherwise it did taste good.   i also had the yummy egg tarts and egg tarts w/fruit.  i also had the silky tofu in sugar-ginger soup....ooh  so warm to my belly.  i think its a good idea to come around 12:30pm, b/c the longer we stayed the more new dishes came out.  right before we were leaving, we saw the this pineapple bun filled yellow egg custard.  that was the first time i had that.  imagine, taking a bite on a sweet crusty bun and having creamy yellow egg custard squeeze into your mouth.  so for now, this place will have to do as i join my lovely dining companion for the search for the best place for dim sum in all of vegas...stay tuned b/c i have another restaurant in mind already....."}
{"text":"I never had Dim Sum before but I'll be back. The Chive Dumplings and Pork Bun with black bean and sesame seeds were delicious!  I never had Sunflower Tea before but I will again, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!   After a horrible experience at a Korean place the night before, I was hesitant to try out this dim sum place in Vegas. Thankfully, it was a great experience. It was around 9:30 PM and the place was pretty empty except for a couple of other people, but they still had carts to bring around, which surprised me because most dim sum places will just serve when items are ordered. The food tasted amazing, full of flavor, and definitely not a disappointment. The ladies that worked their were very nice as well. I'll be sure to come visit again for sure the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has changed a lot over the years.  The food is okay tasting but too salty. The reason I'm giving it one star is because they were incredibly rude and we saw some pretty gross things going on. I've been going there for 10 years and it's sad to see how the downhill it's gone! They were recently shut down by the health department because they had so many violations. For some reason, we thought it was safe to go back. What a mistake!  I asked for a fork and the waitress dropped it on the floor and then handed it to me. When I told her I wanted a new one, I could tell she was bothered by the fact that I didn't want that one. She walked away and then brought me back the same exact fork! I saw that she didn't switch it out. My sister's water cup had lipstick on it (not hers), we saw them handle food with bare hands, on and on. It's such a shame this place is so dirty and the service is so bad because it was once in a good place for dim sum - not any longer!"}
{"text":"We ended our family reunion with some dim sum.  After yelping and talking with some of the locals, we decided to try orchids.  We wanted to go somewhere off the strip.  It is about 10-15 minute drive from the strip.  We had a large party (39) and the staff was very accommodating.  We arrived as soon as they opened because we feared that we would not be seated.  As soon as we arrived, no lines and we were seated immediately.  Food was good.   It started getting packed around 11:30ish.  Glad we tried Orchids."}
{"text":"Moving from San Diego, trying to find good restaurants in the foods that I love can be a challenge but I love how they have dim sum all day . Most places back home have set dim sum times. Prices are reasonable and it's never packed so there's never a waiting food my go to dim sum place!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. Love going there almost every Sunday or Monday for brunch. Staff is very friendly also."}
{"text":"Had many dim sum dishes: dumplings, duck, smelt, etc. Each dish was tasty, but my very favorite was the pork shumai. The flavor seemed to explode out of the dumpling and made the experience exceptional. Also, the wait staff was willing to order special dim sum for us, despite our late dining hour of 9pm. All said, a pretty darn good Vegas restaurant. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I rate this place on dim sum only. I've never eaten here for a la carte dinner.   I love this place for dim sum. Its always packed and the food is hot and great. I love the tripe and the har gow as well as the white radish cakes and the congee. We enjoy every dish we get from this place.    I took away one star for two reasons. 1. the place is a bit dirty and 2. the dim sum cart ladies are relentless. They come by your table if you even make accidental eye contact with them and start putting dishes on your table when you didn't even order it. You have to really say no to them to go away but then 5 minutes later they are back."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but their customer service is horrible. When we ask for something they either gave us attitude and or ignore us. You know the service is so horrible when they bring our check and we did not even ask for it but the point is they not even busy!!!"}
{"text":"Not impress! Went around 8:30 pm for some dim sum and everything on the cart was old. Supposedly this place serves dim sum all day, right..old dim sum. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am a dim sum fan and this is the best in town.  The carts come out quickly and often (almost too often) but the dumplings are the tastiest.  The duck is yummy too."}
{"text":"My wife and I found the dim sum at Orchid Garden to be as good as any we have found in the USA.  That includes NYC ( including Flushing/Queens), Chicago, San Francisco, etc.  My wife is a mainland Chinese native and I lived in China for several years.  In short if you don't find this dim sum authentic  you might not know what authentic is :0. It's the best I've had since my last trip to Hong Kong/ Shenzhen"}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Reasonable price. But they seem to want to rush you in and out. They were asking if we want dim sum out of the carts before I even sat down."}
{"text":"Very good and affordable. The food is filling and their dimsum is the best. We'll definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"Food was good. Chicken feet and shrimp balls were my favorite! Waitress was rude when I asked her for another order of food. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"The food has so much flavor, fresh and is one of my favorites. The service is good, and they serve the dim sum off carts and you pick out as much as you want."}
{"text":"First time here and I am a fan!  The parking lot was PACKED and so was the restaurant but it was lunch time on a Sunday so it was expected to be crowded.  I would totally recommend Orchids for dim sum.  We were staying at the Stratosphere so it was very easy to get to Orchids.  The service was polite and quick and accommodating.  The dim sum was delicious and very reasonable.  I had four dishes of dim sum and it was less than $10."}
{"text":"I've tried other dim sum places in Vegas and this place is definitely the best.  Nothing compared to dim sum in the SGV, but like I said, this is Vegas!!  I went on a weekday, so there was no wait... not sure if it holds the same on a weekend.  The service is good and the ladies pushing the carts around are very accommodating.  The clientele is very mixed so they can all speak basic English and can give general descriptions of the dim sum if needed.  The food is good, but I wasn't a fan of the turnip cake (lo bak go) or juicy dumplings (xiao long bao).  These dishes can definitely be skipped.  I thought it was a bit pricey for dim sum, but then again I am used to the prices in the SGV where all the dishes are the same price and aren't separated by size."}
{"text":"Getting my dim  sum fix. It's been awhile.  Service is okay. Go early and stay late. Dishes come out on carts and you chose your dim sum. Price went up but still good. I usually get the same items. Shu mai, baked pork buns, noodles, roast pork. About $20...I also get some dessert to go. Clean and it gets busy also .."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with their dim sum! I used to live in California and growing up, there were plenty of dim sum restaurants that were very good, but as I've gotten older, quality dim sum was harder to find. I've been here twice. The first time, I went mid-day and service was great! The ladies with the carts were coming by our table every few minutes. Our water/tea was constantly refilled and the staff was very friendly.  The second I went, it was around 9:30pm and I'll be honest, I was expecting the dim sum to be old and perhaps dried out. To my surprise, the dim sum was still fresh and tasted delicious! Again, service was great at this hour and the staff, always so friendly."}
{"text":"It was ok not great. Price was resonable. Service need more attentive. I have to ask twice for each items i want to get."}
{"text":"Some reason I remember this place being cheaper. Or maybe I'm getting cheaper. Anyways, this place is a nice large restaurant able to seat lots of people on weekends and holidays.    If you plan ahead, look in the Las Vegas Review Journal newspaper for a tiny  little 1inch by 2inch ad for 10% off your entire bill. Location of the ad/coupon varies so it might take a couple minutes."}
{"text":"My friend, her son, and I went once again today and loved all the food. For some reason, the food was better today than it was the last two times.. And bigger. The shrimp was bigger. The eggplant was bigger and tastier. We had two orders of chicken feet, steamed sticky rice, and much much more. I am definitely going again."}
{"text":"This place is great! 2nd time here. The price is absolutely affordable, great dim sum, and a pretty good selection. This is not 5 star dining, so I don't know what people are complaining about. It's Dim Sum for crying out loud!  The carts are pushed around often, good selection to choose from, friendly staff. What more could you want. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because they made me fried rice with no oil.  Lots of seating did not have to wait. Cheap too. I wanted to add that the parking was good and that the trays of food kept coming out  the pot stickers, there were many sugary items if u like that but the vegetables were plenty as well. I think its a cute . The place has two ways to go be strict on a diet or go ahead and enjoy. Only reason for 4 stars is bathroom was a little icky."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum as well as dinner.  The dim sum was OK as well as dinner.  Although they have all day dim sum, I wouldn't have it during dinner time for it's been sitting there all day.  The service was on par with other Chinese restaurant.  No smile, takes the order, deliver the food, and the check after flagging any server down. We are both Asian and  we can't think of any compelling reason to return."}
{"text":"My son loves it here! Good dim sum for the right price. We will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Everything is salty or extra salty...  So we ordered the chicken fried noodle and it is no better.  For us, it is a once over adventure."}
{"text":"Dim Sum or lazy man's buffet?  Orchid Garden looks very impressive as you pull in to the parking lot.  When I saw the sign advertising Dim Sum all day, I was elated.  It was like a snow day on a day you didn't do you homework.  I was seated in the busy restaurant and ready to nosh!  Dining here when it is busy reminded me of the crowded China Town streets of Chicago more than the food did.  Waitresses are running up and down the aisled with carts full of various small bites (Dim Sum).  While I liked the variety, I was not blown away by any one dish.  The pork buns, fried calamari, and shrimp puff all had very similar flavors, as if they were seasoned using the same ingredients.  They weren't bad, but did not taste that fresh.  I was reminded of buffet food, which is usually fine but not spectacular.    The regular menu here has some very interesting and authentic dishes.  (Sea Cucumber, various fungi, etc..)  The Dim Sum is really just like going to a Chinese buffet and not getting out of your seat when you want more.  To dine here without waiting very long, try coming at off times or during lunch on a weekday.    It is decent Chinese food at fair prices, but the Dim Sum leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"The only reason I like this place is that you can have dimsum here all day into the evenings, Because most places stop dimsum a 3pm. It's not a fancy restaurant and their dimsum selections are alright by me. It's an okay place for me."}
{"text":"This isn't the best dim sum ever; but for Vegas dim sum, it does the trick. It's a bit easier to go to sometimes than braving the craziness around Chinatown too; which is probably why I come here more often. I know a few of my friends have had a bit of difficulty ordering when they've come here but I haven't experienced that difficulty myself... Perhaps that's simply because my minimal Cantonese ONLY extends to ordering food. We often will just order take-out dim sum when we come here and usually that works out just as well. I've brought one large group here for Chinese New Year and it was easy and well organized. I think the three-star rating describes my feelings perfectly- A-OK."}
{"text":"This is no Alhambra, but I thought everything was pretty good for this Las Vegas dim sum joint.  I thought the addition of a bottle of mayo sauce was weird, but I did try it with my stuff and it was not bad.  (well, it was bringing me closer to heart disease)  I heart anything that was shrimp in those little pots or on plates = YUM."}
{"text":"You cannot believe that I spend 3 days in Las Vegas to have breakfast in this restaurant. They have promotion with their lobster that BOGO free so I had ordered this plate and that was my best choice because their salt & pepper lobster is so delicious!  If you want to find out where is thebest dim sum in Las Vegas or Chinese restaurant, this place is the best. However, if you want to find a good service this place does not for you. It is so noisy because they call number waiting and they speak Chinese so much. This place is the best for food and the worst for service. Think about what you want before deciding come here."}
{"text":"Ok I see this place is busy but must be because of out of towners because the food is meh!! The food is mediocre. I have never been to a dim sum restaurant that does not have any hao cao. Every time the carts come by, I would ask \" u have ha cao?\" The answer was \" it 's coming.\"  We were there 2 hours and it never came. Heard the wait staff tell a Chinese customer there is no ha cao. What the heck? How can u call yourself a dim sum restaurant and not serve ha cao? That's like going to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve enchiladas or tacos.  I was totally disappointed. The dishes were not hot- a no no for Asian restaurant. Will never go again- only went because the hubby loved it.  There are way better dim sum places on spring mountain road- Chinatown/vietnatown of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We always see the commercial at TFC and intrigued by this whole day dim sum spot so we gave it a try. Decor and ambience is your average Chinese restaurant.  We were seated right away and immediately served by one of the carts. In addition to the typical dim sum offerings, we were Pleasantly surprised that they have chow mein, steamed clams and shark's fin siomai. Disappointed that they don't have the fried seaweed roll and they don't automaticAlly serve the mustard/chili combo sauce. Towards the middle of our meal, my friend was speechless and immobilized as a small cockroach started walking across the table in front of her, it was small and didn't touch the food, but it's still a cockroach!! It made us wonder if the dining area has cockroach, how about tHe kitchen full of food?  We don't know if we're coming back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and nice after closing time. But the food is more salty than last time. After I had a meal, I was feel tired and want to sleep. I guess they add on too much MSG in the food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, you can take this place off your list. Flavors were off and portions were small."}
{"text":"Went to this dim sum restaurant instead of Chang's.   And it was great. Seen reviews on Chang's to go here and it was a smart move. All 3 over ate for $50."}
{"text":"This place definitely be my go to spot for Dim Sum when I'm in Vegas. The restaurant was nice, the bathroom was clean and the staff was friendly. Now let's talk about the food, it was all that. We had several different dishes which were a great. If you have time to stop in for some good Dim Sum this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Las Vegas.  All the dishes we had were well executed and delicious:  - Spinach/pork dumplings - Peanut dumplings - Shrimp dumplings - Eggplant stuffed with shrimp (so good that we got two of these) - Steamed pork buns (they also had baked pork buns, which we'll try next time) - Long rice noodles stuffed with shrimp - Sesame seed balls, stuffed with red bean paste - Egg custard cups (with the flakiest crust I've had with these)  All of this wonderful food was extremely reasonably priced ($26 including tax).  While the restaurant was packed, we were seated right away in a very comfortable booth.  The service was attentive, the restaurant was clean and the food was delicious.  Most of the staff only spoke a few words of English, and neither of us speak Chinese, but the staff tried hard to explain things to us and were much, much nicer than the staff at Changs (which I won't even go to any more because of how rude they were to me and how poorly we were treated there).  I would come back here in a nanosecond."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its run down appearance and less than amazing customer service once you try the dim sum here those things won't even matter. My family and I have come here my entire life and although it does have it's quirks the food never disappoints. Dim sum here with my huge family crowded around the spinning table is by far one of my best memories."}
{"text":"This is my go-to dim sum spot in Vegas, hands down. Whether you are a dim sum connoisseur or have never been, this place is a fun dining experience with delicious food! Carts are pushed around with different food items, your table will be approached, you pick what you want (don't be shy to ask, they'll tell you!) and you are tallied with a stamp card until you are ready to pay!   Okay. Yes, people complain about the aggressive asian women pushing the carts, or the fact that it doesn't compare to California dim sum or blah blah blah... BUT! This place has consistently good food, has all-day dim sum and has a ton of seating -- so the wait is never bad even if they're slammed. Did I mention their lunch time prices are crazy worth it?!   MUST TRY: - Pork siu mai (pork dumpling) - Shrimp har gow (shrimp dumpling) - Shark fin dumpling - Sugar cane shrimp ball - Fried shrimp ball  - Shrimp wonton (fried, served with sweet mayo) - Bola bao (baked sweet egg custard filled bun) - Spinach dumping (I've heard this also referred to as meatballs?) - Crab claw - Chicken wings (call me crazy but I feel like these taste like nutella...) - Steamed chicken feet (I am not a personal fan of this, but find this is very popular among almost everyone I have dim sum with haha)  *I always get this with a small side of white rice. And their hot tea! :)"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a place I used to go when I was a little girl in Dallas, having Dim Sum with my parents.  Everything is so authentic and traditional Chinese dim sum.  The only thing is it gets so busy that I would advise go during the weekdays instead of the weekends.  But if you must go during the weekend, I would advise go early.  Next time I will be heading there for the weekend and see if they offer more items."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. First time trying dim sum. The carts came out very fast.  Service was good &  so was the food. I wish I could've ordered more because everything looked good but I got full pretty fast. But shout out to the pork siomai...the best, it was so good! I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas =)"}
{"text":"Not too familiar with dim sum, but overall I tought it was worthy of 4 stars.  It's a good value proposition, felt authentic, but the quality of the food could be a little better. Four of us are plenty withy left overs for $55."}
{"text":"It was an unusual wet, rainy afternoon in Las Vegas and before long almost all 14 of us would be getting on planes that would take us to cities across the U.S.  Our party of realtors and lenders (almost all asians) decided to run over and have a much needed \"comfort food\" lunch after enjoying days of rich, over the top dining experiences.  A local realtor recommended this place and it did not disappoint.  In fact, our entire meal was absolutely delicious!  Two Chinese members of our party did the ordering so the variety was excellent, we had dishes that I have never ordered/tasted before.  And while I confess my tastes may be a bit pedestrian, I especially enjoyed the fried shrimp with shell (which I order often), it was delicately crispy and not too salty.  My other favorites were shrimp in rice noodle rolls, spinach dumpling, sticky rice in lotus leaf, shrimp balls, siu mai, bbq pork buns, chinese broccoli, sweet tofu and fried sesame balls.  I was even impressed with the baked egg tart.  It's pastry was crumbly and the egg custard tasted home made.  I left absolutely stuffed, everything was so good that I ate more than was sensible!  Price was reasonable, decor was what one typically expects (broken in and a bit kicked up), ample parking.  I absolutely recommend this dim sum restaurant as a great place to check out in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to dim sum spot in Vegas.  Customer service has gotten better over the years. We used to come because we like the food but now it's a pleasant experience with better service. Make sure to not let them stamp your card before bringing out your food.. Some waiters/waitresses will try to stamp it twice and charge you double!  There's always a good variety of food and they will make any item on the menu by request if it is not available on the carts. Try the pineapple buns for dessert!   They're de-lish!"}
{"text":"This place is only A-OK for me. My dad choses to come here every time we visit vegas. Being Chinese, you just gotta try the Dim Sum in other parts of the country/world. You just gotta. Well here is my take on this past experience:  Personally, I thought food was average/ could have been much better. We came here when they first opened and things were fresh and delicious. This time around, not the same. The Shao Long Bao (Pork Mini Buns) were dry and nasty. The rice wrapped in lotus leaves tasted a bit odd and the Shu Mai and Chicken hands could have been much better prepared. Something just didn't taste right when I ate it. Maybe it was just a bad experience this time around? I mean we do come here often when we visit Vegas. So for now, I suppose I give them a 2.5/3 for their decent food. I'll be back, don't worry! I'll let you know how they hold up :)"}
{"text":"This is one of our family staples when I go to Vegas to visit Mom.  They serve dim sum all day and it's pretty good.  Large variety, including a steamed Chinese broccoli plate, crispy noodles, a fried cart with sesame balls, custard tarts etc, a couple of steamed carts including my favorite har gao and siu mai.  The lo mein is excellent too.  Recommend it for take out or for dining in.  On top of it all, it's very accessible and parking isn't too heinous, though you may have to look harder during peak hours for brunch on the weekends.  The tables are clean, the prices are reasonable and the service is attentive and fast."}
{"text":"The service, food, and atmosphere were all consistently sub par. I have tried 3 dim sum restaurants in the LV area and this one ranks third on the list. I had high hopes since this was the first one I tried in China town. They had many dishes I had never seen before, most of which weren't appealing to me. I might have been interested in some of them but was unable to find out information needed to decide if they were items I'd like to try as the ladies womaning the carts were short and not willing to take the time to explain their contents."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place. Best Dim Sum ive ever had, even better than San Franciso. Eat here and you wont regret it."}
{"text":"My family (Chinese, from Hawaii) has been eating here for 15 years and we absolutely love it!! The dim sum is our favorite, but we also eat from the menu, too. We particularly love menu items like the House Special pan fried noodles, the almond shrimp, steamed ginger chicken and the steamed fish. Mrs. Wong, who owns the place, runs a tight ship and is on hand pretty much of the time to greet customers and make sure everyone is given the very best of service and food. When my dad died, this past year, nearly the entire staff expressed their condolences and when my wife and I go there now, they greet us like their own family and bring our favorite dim sum to the table. We'll be sticking with Orchids Garden as our Chinese restaurant of choice. Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fast as hell. All the ones they brought out was amazing.   One of the servers reached across the table to give me some food, that wasn't good. But the rest of the servers were cool. Didn't understand a word they said, but I just looked at the food and pointed at the ones I wanted.   The environment was cool. Nice and spacey.   Best thing about this place is that u don't have to wait for your food to come."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this needed to be said. My family has been coming to this restaurant regularly for years (on average, we come in 3-5 times a month). We constantly come back simply because of our love for dim sum and only that. Since the first day we ate here, service has always been unreliable. Perhaps 1 out of every 5 visits here, we receive somewhat mediocre service. Every other time, we are faced with rude and dismissive servers, eager to just move through every table and complete their rotation. One server, who clearly had plenty more shumai in her cart, was extremely hesitant to give us more than one order. Shu mai is our family's favorite and we typically order at least 3 bowls. It seems as if every employee there would rather be somewhere else. Even the lady, who seems to be the manager, was on her phone before my brother personally went up to her asking for our check. Our table was right in front of her and we had finished eating atleast 10 minutes prior. The food is good, but we will consider going to another establishment next time. The 2 stars are only for the food. I hope they fix these problems soon."}
{"text":"Big and spacious inside, this is a great place for all day dim sum. And that's all-day, unlike lots of places that serve it for just a couple of hours on certain days, so no long lines of people hoping they get in. The carts of dishes come around constantly. The servers roll them right up and tell you what they have, so the service is excellent. We really liked the steamed bbq buns and the shrimp balls."}
{"text":"This is my spot. I always forget to check in but I come every Wednesday and if I miss a day I make sure I make up for it later that week lol. The workers remember me every time I come in. I usually come with my daughter on Wednesdays. My wife likes this place also but not as much as me. When ordering water you ask for a cup of Only ice. I like my water very cold and they don't give you alot of ice in your water. Service has gotten better through the times. A few things you have to get when here,  Shumai Haw-gow Shrimp noddle Chowmein Pork spareribs Beef tendons Fried sugar cane shrimp ball Chinese broccoli  Chive dumpling  Taro  Fried wontons Calamari Fried chicken Duck  They have a lot more food on there carts but these are my go to items. I do try the other items and they are fresh and good but these items i listed are my mains lol. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"OMmmmmg try the baked BBQ pork buns. Please. It's worth it. I think they hired someone who previously worked at Krispy Kreme, got their donut dough recipe, and then shoved tasty pork inside.   For the rest of it: 3 stars. It's a good place, probably the best in town. But if you know the real thing, Orchids Garden doesn't quite stand up to it."}
{"text":"Won't be returning here. The service was okay at best. The cart experience was not impressive at all. I have enjoyed Dim Sum all over the US and this was not a good experience. We were not offered a menu and asked for items not on the cart. The soup dumplings were worth the wait and that was about the only enjoyable thing we ate. Our drinks were never refilled. This was overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum restaurants I've ever been to. The food was delicious. The dim sum that arrived on carts were still warm and & prepared fresh. I would recommend the calamari, it wasn't too crunchy which I liked.    The servers were more polite than usual for a chinese dim sum restaurant and every time we asked for a certain item not on that person's cart they would try to grab the attention of the person pushing the cart with the food we wanted.   The only negative was that their bathrooms weren't so great. Not too clean, toilet paper on the floor and such."}
{"text":"EWW! this place is disgusting i hate their food now. Last time we came here the food was delicious, but now this place has gone way downhill. First of all  the fried rice was not fried, so i brought this to the waitress's attention. But she insisted it was fried, then another lady came over and said it was fried. Believe me it was white and not fried, last time we ate here it was fried and delicious. So then the waitress brings out white rice without the egg and thinks that what i wanted, i said no I just wanted fried rice. She continues to argue with me, why not offer to get me a new order of fried rice, or get something different. No customer service skills, didnt even try to make the situation better. Then if that wasnt bad enough the chicken was grey and had pieces of  bones in it. Im not even sure if it was chicken! I mean this place has been shut down before for filthy conditions, i should have known better. No offer to reduce the bill, nothing. I also think language is a problem here. This place is a dump i dont suggest you eat here, hopefully more will not get food poisioning. Hell China A Go Go is better."}
{"text":"The workers here barely speak English and when you try to explain to them they don't understand what's going on. I don't like it here they have bad attitudes"}
{"text":"The hustle and bustle on a weekday afternoon didn't surprise me considering good Chinese food is hard to find here! But this place seems to be where the local older Chinese people come to.  The best dim sum, hands down I've had, was in Vancouver, Canada . But I digress.   This place overall is probably one of the best in town. It's clean (I give high marks for this-nothing kills an appetite like a dirty joint), the selection is varied, and some dishes like the bok choy are delicious.  I would definitely recommend coming here to try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. We paid 40$ for 2 sodas a plate of mongolian beef , combination fried rice 6 pc chicken wings and 2 sweet breads I feel it could have been a bit cheaper. The service is average nothing spectacular.  Its pretty cool seeing the ladies go by with the food carts , but becomes  annoying after a while because the same ladies keep trying to get you to buy more food. They should just keep walking if im interested ill flag you down."}
{"text":"We always eat here everytime we.visit Las Vegas. Great dim sum, reasonable price. Service is great. No wonder it is packed. wil definitely come again."}
{"text":"I love dimsum & this place is my go-to dimsum restaurant. I believe it's all day dimsum which I appreciate because my cravings varies & when I want it, I gotta have it, no matter what time. LOL.  I enjoy their Shumai, \"Manapuas\" (Both white & brown bread), Short Ribs, etc!   It's probably not the best place to get dimsum but I end up coming here all the time. Unless I find another dimsum place to fall in love with, my heart is with Orchids Garden!"}
{"text":"You win some... You lose some... Then you get Dim-Sum!  Our Go-To dim sum spot ANY time of day. Yes, it's perfectly okay to have dim sum for dinner (break all rules!).  I can't spell the traditional names so I'm going to review in an american fashion.  SHRIMP anything is delicious . The shrimp with sugar cane is good. The shrimp with fried crispie stuff is good.  The steamed shrimp and pork shumai is good. I mean, it's dim sum! Mostly Everything is good! I even like the chicken feet and the tripe!   I guess what i can review best about is quality. Out of a few dim sum spots around town this place is my favorite. The food never disappoints!  Service is somewhat lacking as my water was empty a few times before i had to flag down a waiter to refill me.   Overall, if you want dim sum, ORCHID Gardens is the bee's knee's or the cat's pajama's..whatever you prefer."}
{"text":"First time getting Dim Sum somewhere else than a Strip buffet.  Food was good.  Ladies bring the Dim Sum carts to each table and you select what you would like to have; each cart has a different Dim Sum focus - steamed on one cart, fried or baked on another, sweets on another.  Sometimes their accents are difficult but that just makes it more interesting and authentic!  Don't be afraid to ask about ingredients and such if you need to.  I'll be going again."}
{"text":"Yuck.....do not try d trepe horrible! Everything was cold! Especially fried wontons! The duck had no meat on it.."}
{"text":"I Love this Place. Good Food Good prices  Service is Good Too But Sometimes the stuff is cold. I dont know how dim sum can be cold????? The springrolls are Not Good at all."}
{"text":"Lived here for years and discovered this place, when I had just a horrible experience at my previous dim sum place. EXCELLENT selection, attentive service and fantastic value! You can come in for a quick nosh or stay for hours, and the staff treats you very well. I have been there about 5 times so far, and it hasnt changed. Virtually never a wait for seating (unlike Cathay House and the others).   They always have a nice selection of carts with both the usual (shu mai, siopao, shrimp balls) and unusual items of interest (tripe, chicken feet). As in all Dim Sum eateries, be prepared to wait if you have a favorite. Otherwise, just pickup your ticket and go searching. This is actually ok behaviour there and will quicken your time waiting."}
{"text":"Always my go-to for quick tasty dim sum, I especially enjoy going during their happy Hour.  They have a lot of roving food carts and the order process is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Vegas from L.A. two months ago, the hubby and I wanted to try out some dim sum for the first time. We have a lot of places to compare to, so we weren't expecting extraordinary food. However, we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem on the way to a gun range. Stopped in for lunch, it was excellent! The dim sum was very fresh and tasty, with a wide variety to choose from. My favorite was the ginger tripe and the hubs loved the tendon dish. We also ordered the house special fried rice....it was good, but not anything special. I have to admit, the service was beyond excellent - the staff was attentive, fast and nice, nothing like what we're used to at other chinese restaurants. The prices here are a little high given what we ordered, but we'll definitely be back again. You can't beat all day dim sum :)"}
{"text":"Went to Orchids in Vegas during our vacation because parents wanted to have Chinese food. Had to call a taxi from the strips since we didn't have a car. The place was huge but there weren't many people when we got there around noon time, which was good for us.   The food was not stellar but it wasn't terrible. It's just okay, average. I wouldn't mind going back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place.  The food is delicious and remarkably affordable!  I haven't been to any other dimsum restaurant here in Vegas, so I can't compare to others, but this once is delicious.  They have a good variety of dishes.  I love the stuffed taro, the baked and steamed pork shumai, the chow mein, the chinese broccoli...  I love it all.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of the service, not the food.  Often you have to wave someone down to get them to refill your drink. Also, some times I will request a dish and they just never bring it by for us.    Besides those minor details, this is a great place to dine!  *Can't review the regular menu because we also get the dimsum."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat at any time of the day.  Best Won Ton soup in Vegas.  I eat here about 2-3 times per week"}
{"text":"There are probably four dedicated dim sum joints in Vegas now, after visiting the other three, this was the only left I have yet to try.  We arrived about noon and seated rather quickly despite the whole dining room being full of people.  The dim sum quality was a bit disappointing for Vegas standard.  Shu Mai was very gross with just pork inside.  Rice Rolls were ok.  Fruit Tart and Coconut Buns were conceptually interesting. Chicken Feets were too saucy. Xiaolongbao, cannot expect much from non-Shanghainese joint.  Everything else was at par.  The dim sum ladies were very aggressive in selling their items, almost like a 5 minutes repeating cycle asking to get something without realizing our table was already full.  Orchid Garden was ok neighborhood dim sum joint, and I suppose the locals would visit here more often due to the logistic and distance away the tourist crowd near the Strip."}
{"text":"I love that they have dim sum all day. Only been here once and it was just okay to below average. I ordered my usual favorites: calamari was cold and greasy, though very crispy, probably would have been quite good if it were hot and fresh.  Fried taro wasn't very good, outside was not light and fluffy at all, and I didn't like the filling.  Sticky rice wrapped in leaves was okay, but I've had better, did not detect any mushrooms in the filling which is my favorite part. Shu mai was good. Shrimp dumplings okay. Leek dumplings were greasy. The chicken bao was good but could have used more filling. The shrimp rice noodle roll also lacked filling. The congee just didn't look like there was much it it so I didn't get any. The 8 dishes ordered and hot tea came out to $30 and some change. Just a side note...I felt pretty queasy after eating there. Chang's is better!"}
{"text":"I don't go anywhere else for a dimsum than here. Good service and food is ok. beef short ribs are to die for! I order every time the bbq pork buns, sticky and delicious! Lol I just wish they will open one near henderson this is place is a drive. Sunday is pretty packed so make sure you get here earlier before lunch rush."}
{"text":"Busy, busy place, but efficient for a quick, yummy meal. I love dimsum and the food and service is great here, but we always end up racking up a big bill. It's easy to keep picking up plates from the rolling carts."}
{"text":"Always bad service used to be good food those old ladies pushing the carts too slow and only one cart of dimsum rolling around even their busy"}
{"text":"Orchids has the best Dim Sum in town, in my opinion. I love that they serve it all day, too. I've eaten Dim Sum at other Chinese restaurants in Vegas, but I always go back to Orchids because theirs just tastes better to me. I gave only 4 stars because some of the staff could be nicer, and it could be a little bit cleaner."}
{"text":"Food was quite good with a large selection to choose from. The service was also quite good. I was a little surprised because some of the reviews were not very flattering, but our service today was on par. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"There service is okay. Sometimes they'll skip you in the rotation. But here is the gist. It's the best place to get dim sum in Vegas. It's not on Cali's level but it suffices my appetite. Plus it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday. We live Dim Sum and this is so far our favorite place to enjoy it! Service is mediocre as sometimes it's difficult to understand them. It's decently priced, for 9 people we paid 150 and that's with the gratuity included!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat dimsum. We always go here and order dimsum or their regular food. Food is great! Now we can also order from DoorDash and deliver it to us.  This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a very big Chinese restaurant with all day dim sum.  The service might not be so good but they have some good dim sum.   I loved their two kinds of sesame balls and creme bun.  These are  the best  desserts!  Their dumpling are so good too(shumai and shrimp, and chives). The sticky rice in a bamboo leaf did not impress me much.  I have no idea about their regular food since I did not order any but I would go back for their dim sum anytime!  This place can get packed very quickly so get there early and secure a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for Superbowl and Chinese New Years.  Ate here Chinese New Years for dinner based upon a recommendation of a local we met on the plane flying here.  Spot on.  It was a treat.  Had both Dim Sum........at night.  Which is unusual.  Usually they only serve this early in the day.  And you could order off the menu for other chinese food.  Key point..........LOTS of Asians here.  That means USUALLY a good place to eat.  My buddy and I ate Roast Duck, shrimp, House Special LoMein.  Service was good; though not prompt.  I would highly recommend this place.....and did so to others that worked at the casino we were staying at."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good but the prices were extremely high!  I can see myself returning for the food; unfortunately, the cost will deter me from making this place a regular favorite."}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum.  Be aware.  They come at you fast and furious with the plates right as you sit down---like Pirahna, only they have a veracity to feed you.  Many good choices.  A little heavy on the pork options.  Still very flavorful and hot. Great mango pudding/jello. So many things to sample and too small a belly."}
{"text":"Been trying to find a good dim sum restaurant in Las Vegas. This place was pretty decent. Everything was very greasy and fatty which I love. This is better than most places around here. But still not as good as the dim sum places in Cali."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch, lots of different dishes to try, i suggest trying them all. Don't be afraid to point and ask as you'll never know if you'll like it."}
{"text":"Food kept coming and there was no wait. Servers were very sweet and quick. This place is great for large groups. However,  It was very busy and very loud."}
{"text":"I would call this the run of the mill average to above average dim sum dining. There's a lot better out there in other cities, but also a lot worse (like my city). If you live in a city with amazing dim sum (SoCal etc) you'll likely find this place just ok, but for anyone coming from towns that don't have much, you will enjoy this.  The pros here is that they have dim sum all day, and the restaurant space is large to accommodate many people. Parking is available in the large lot, but I could see parking being a problem if many large families bought many cars and filled up the place. The restaurant was about half full when we dined in, and the carts came around quickly offering us various dishes. I thought the selection was pretty decent, and they certainly have all the \"essentials\". There are some fancier places that have more options but I think Orchids does just fine with what they provide.  I would return if I got another dim sum craving while visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Dim Sum I ever had.  Almost every dish is super salty.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff here are extremely respectful and patient to ensure that large parties - such as the group I was with the other night - are well tended to at the individual level. One thing I noticed that even in a group of about 8 they would ask each person anytime they had food to offer drinks or needed more services. The food here was really great! Based on my friends' reactions I'd recommend the duck, we got it with buns. Surprisingly enough though it definitely was the fried tofu that was amazing and one of the best things I had to eat.   My concerns are that while the staff was attentive when there, they were not often attentive throughout the night. The green tea served was also never replenished and with a large group that is something I would have appreciated. However, these concerns are minor enough that I'm still more than happy to give this place 4/5 stars !"}
{"text":"First, the plusses:  Orchids Garden offers Dim Sum all day, not just during the morning and lunch hours.  It's inexpensive.  Two of us staggered out for $18, including tax and a generous tip. The minuses:  It's way too far away from my apartment near UNLV.  As in too many transfers, too long a bus ride.  The Dim Sum was okay.  We had a variety of dishes, but nothing was superb. The neither-good-nor-bad:  Orchids Garden also has American-style Chinese food (Chow mein, sweet and sour something...).  I saw an Anglo couple (I'm Anglo, too) with those kinds of dishes on their table.  There were also plenty of Asians eating Dim Sum or real Chinese food.  If I were going out for Chinese food with a very mixed group (which would be my classmates, or my former colleagues), this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking."}
{"text":"First visit and I was not sure what to expect.  Was not to sure what this whole dim sum thing was about only that it was small portions that came to you on carts and you just picked what you wanted. Went with 2 girlfriends from school and we were hungry. We ended up getting 9 plates to share. It did not seem like a lot of food because everything came in 3s. Three small potstickers, three small pork balls, three small this, and that. Well we were so wrong.    After eating all the different things we had to be rolled out of there.   Place was good, only problem is you don't know how much things cost when they are wheeling them around. They ask if you want it, you say yes, they give it to you then they take a stamp and place it on A,B,C etc.  at the end they take your ticket and bring you back your bill with the price. Everything in Chinese except the dollar amount.   I would go back and give it another try. Like I said food was good. It was kept hog and fresh."}
{"text":"Wow. The fake food display look more eatable then the one are serve. Everything seem burn, dumpling, bake BBQ bun and even the radish cake.  So disappointed!!!!  All the yelper who have this place a 4 or 5 stars are mainly white."}
{"text":"Okay... I have only lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years now.  The only two places that I have had Dim Sum is at Cathay House (4x's) and Orchid Gardens (first time here).  Honestly, Cathay House has gotten a bit downhill.  So, after this experience, I kinda prefer this place now.  By the way, when I lived in London, we used to have Dim Sum with my clients every Sunday.  After a year of this, I don't frequent Dim Sum as much...lol..  Anyways, my aunt, uncle, and cousin invited me and the wife for a \"free\" lunch at Orchid Gardens.  Hey man, with a mortgage and expenses, the old saying, \"if it is free, it is for me\" truly applies.  Heck yeah, I accepted.  LOL...  We went on Sunday afternoon.  It was jammed pack.  We had to wait about 30 minutes.  When we got a table, it was difficult to maneuver through.    Service -- Well, let's start with the good.  The cart comes around quite frequently.  And, the ladies are very nice.  By the way, they hardly speak a word of english.  I think they are either Vietnamese, Chinese, or a mix of other Asian ethnicity.  But, they are all sweet and polite.  As for getting water or drinks.... Good luck.  Sometimes, I often wish that I bring a big bright flashing red light to alert waiters or bus people to our station for water or any other needs.  Overall, I give this a 3.5 (due to the nice ladies)  Food -- okay, for the life of me, my wife loves chicken feet.  Why oh why?  It is basically bones and skin; but, she devours them.  For someone who weighs 85 pounds, I can understand why.  Personally, I like the Shumai, the pork rib bones, anything with shrimp stuffed in it, and sticky rice.  There are others; but, I don't know how to write it in english.  Overall, the food is very fresh and it is quite good.  By the way, I wish they had more vegetable dishes... i.e. chinese broccoli or bok choy.  After our meal, our tab for about 6 people was barely under $100.  Not bad.   I would recommend this place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For all the Hawaii residents:  This place has all the Manapua Truck grinds; fried noodles, pork-hash, fried taro, steamed and baked manapua, seasame seed balls (gindoi), and rice cake.  I  like that I can eat Dim-Sum anytime of the day.  The food is already prepared and the hustling service is quick, so you can satisfy your appetite in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Surprised to find a dim sum place this good in Vegas. I might be rating it too high because we currently live in a small town with no dim sum options, but we were very happy both times that we came here on consecutive visits."}
{"text":"Craving DIM SUM, Hawaiian style? This place is 4 stars for the dim sum and prices but 3 stars for regular Chinese food and the ambience/service.  Dim Sum is pretty good and really cheap compared to some of the Honolulu places. We had 12/15 different dishes and the 4 of us dropped only 12 bucks each, all in. They have both the steamed baskets and small dish plate servings. Ladies roam around the large restaurant over and over again.  After awhile it got annoying, especially the harsh tone used as they yell at you what their cart has.  But they do have the green bottle soy sauce(low sodium)!  Of course, it could have been the lack of sleep on our part.  But I figure that if you say \"no, thank you - no need gin dui\" twice, you do not need to hear \"u like gin due?!?!\" over and over again repeatedly.   There were not that many tables at an early lunch so I was hoping they would remember that our table does not want gin dui!   oh well.  I bring sign next time - \"NO GIN DUI HERE\".  Some of my buddies say that in a Dim Sum place you do not need to respond to every call out to your table.  So, is it really OK to just ignore the cart aunties?  I was taught to try to respond to every request to you with \"yes, please, or no thank you\".  I guess I need to learn how to just ignore the cart aunties!  Big  corner sign and Big restaurant with good number of locals getting dim sum in and take out. Overall, very filling cheap dim sum lunch.  Just get some sleep before going as you will need patience with the roaming aunties with carts!  Oh well - time to get back on the HA horse and fly back to Hawaii.  Aloha."}
{"text":"This is a classic dim sum restaurant, and we are lucky to have it! Always plenty of carts passing through with delicious surprises hidden within the steel and bamboo steamers. Delicious/fast/good variety even on a weekday lunch. If you don't like it you don't like dim sum."}
{"text":"Came back for more Dim Sum, brought some friends to try this awesome all day Dim Sum, they too were impressed by the selection , freshness , taste & flavors , and the fact its all day till late late evenings,  so awesome. I am 2 for 2 with Orchid Garden, our server was such a darling little old lady making us feel at home. Coming back in the near future. Try this place if you want to widen your taste buds."}
{"text":"I'm a huge huge fan of dim sum, but was really disappointed with it here. Food was cold, desserts were grainy, and there wasn't that big of a selection on anything. I think the same two carts kept coming around over and over again. Dim sum places I've been to have at least 5 carts of food and they would all be different and filled to the top. This place was beyond dissapointing, esp for the last meal before I flew out of Vegas. And this was coming on a weekend too!! I thought they would have more choices esp for how big the restaurant is."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with the family, every time we are very full, stuffed, and happy when we leaving.  This place is a typical dim sum were the ladies come around in their carts and ask you if you want anything.  Sometimes they are a little persistent, not sure if they work on commission or not.  The ladies are really helpful and will make sure you get what you want.  Some of my favorites are the shumai, dumplings, shrimp balls, and green peppers with shrimp on top.  Make sure you ask for the black bean sauce it is great on the green peppers.  If you have never been to dim come before make sure you get those shrimp balls!! They also have a menu where you can order whatever you want including noodles. This is a great place to bring families or big parties their tables are large and can fit big groups."}
{"text":"I went back about a week ago and it was not as good. Maybe I've been spoiled by Vancouver but the harcow was small and not as tasty as I remember and the same can be said for the bean curd wraps, The BBQ pork buns lacked filled and were too sweet. I hope I just went on a bad day."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service kills! If it wasn't for the fact that the dim sum is all day I wouldn't come to this place. Never ever get the corner booth, I got stuck there and had to keep getting up and go to the girl at the register and ask for someone to tend to us. The other times I've been there I get a table and the service is a bit better but the employees aren't very attentive or customer friendly, they seemed bored or annoyed."}
{"text":"Took a friend of mine to experience dim sum for the first time and we came here because of proximity to a car dealership. I informed my friend that dim sum is a combination of Cantonese fast food except them come to your table in carts and each server tries their best to sell you what is comparable to \"Tapas or appetizers.\" I pick the traditional dishes and guess what my friend chose? He picks out \"Chicken Feet,\" brave soul! Anyways the food is average, the portions are smaller than East Ocean and it's a little pricey. But I've got to give it props because when I looked around my friend was the only Caucasian in the room which means many Asians really like this place. Overall it's not a bad place."}
{"text":"Food was great! Very easy to order/pick what dim sum we wanted because there's a picture menu with the prices for each item. If you wanted something that they do not have in their cart they place the order for you and bring it out later. We went at 5:00pm and they weren't too busy so that might be why service was great.  Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Got here at 10:30 when they first opened so we got right in. I've heard that lunch is really busy so best to get in early. Food was great and the service was pretty good. Can't really complain it was our first time there. We were in and out in about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Very popular dim-sum place in Vegas. Esp. since its \"Dim-Sum All Day\". Been our dim-sum to-go spot until we had an unsanitary dinning experience here.. & honestly, would not be going back. Too disgusted!   Me & my family were having dim sum for lunch when my sister lifted her silverware and napkin she found/ felt a live COCKROACH fall out onto the floor. Did not want to kill it until the manager saw that it was alive. Trapped it under plenty of napkins for the lady to see/kill it for herself. Had no appetite afterwards.. Had to wait for the food we had already ordered and refused to order anymore after we placed our first order. No manager came to speak or apologize to us. We were not acknowledged at all until we finally got our check and even we had to  mention it ourselves to the lady at the register to alter our bill when we paid. Service was horrible & a clean & sanitary environment is important in the food industry!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has dim sum cart service until 10pm everyday.  Dim sum was pretty good but a tad pricey.  We went for dinner on a Sunday around 6pm.  The service was a little slow at first but eventually picked up.  I got all my favorites (siu mai, har gow, crispy shrimp balls) and was stuffed by the end.   It was a little greasier than I would have liked but if I was craving dim sum on a random weekday night, this place will do."}
{"text":"So I came here once before but it was never for the Dim Sum. I noticed that they have Dim Sum all day which is weird to me since most places here stop serving Dim Sum around 2 or 3pm. I've been to a couple places that are popular here in town, but most we tried never left a good impression by the end of our meal. The last time I ever had good Dim Sum was in Hawaii, which is where I am from. So finding a place here in Vegas which had decent Dim Sum was a chore in itself.   My parents and I went out to have Dim Sum since it was their anniversary, and we decided to give Orchids a shot. We were surprised, the flavor was definitely not lacking and the prices where a bit higher than other places, but not too much-quite reasonable. The selection wasn't bad either, it wasn't on the more authentic side but it was enough for everyone to enjoy and feel satisfied.   We went there on a Thursday around 3p and it was a little busy but not so busy to where you are waiting for a table, we were seated right away. I am glad that my parents were quite pleased, and I was too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Considering that the valley isn't oversaturated with dim sum restaurants, the dim sum at Orchids Garden is pretty good. It's a pretty big restaurant and I think the quality of their dim sum slightly less than other places but that wouldn't deter me from coming here again. I'm guessing because they offer dim sum all day, quality might not be as good as places that offer it at a limited time.   I usually don't experience a wait here and the carts come by my table pretty often which I like. The only time I waited, which wasn't too long, was when my fiance and I treated our mothers to a mother's day bunch. Not too shabby!    The biggest plus is that Orchids offers more variety selection of desserts than other dim sum places. (ie not just mango pudding and egg tarts but fruit tart, tofu, mango pudding and some sort of fruit cup)"}
{"text":"Great place for Dim Sum!!! Always offering it and has a great selection. Definetly a stop if you're close and hungry. Never had a problem here with the food or the service. I have been comjng here for over 15 years. That should say enough. Enjoy your meal. :)"}
{"text":"We had dimsum for dinner on a Saturday night at Orchids Garden. They serve dimsum all day from 10:30am - 10:30pm. Since they don't take reservations, we decided to go at 5:30pm - early enough before it gets too crowded.  Waitresses walk around with carts filled with plates of dimsum, and they stop at each table. You pay per plate by category. As you take plates, the watresses stamp your food bill: A ($2.30) - our favorites are the Steamed BBQ Bun and for dessert: Baked Sweet Cream Bun and Red Bean Sesame Ball. B ($3.10) - our favorites are Shrimp Hargow, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Shrimp Pasted Eggplant (make sure you get the sauce), Pan Fried Chives Dumpling, Shrimp with Rice Noodle, and for dessert: Mango or Coconut Pudding (with sweetened condensed milk.) C ($4.15) - Sugar Cane Shrimp D ($6.15) - Chinese Broccoli, Seaweed Salad, and the Chow Mein.  The standouts are the Chow Mein (even though $6.15 is over-priced for noodles), the Steamed BBQ Bun is the best deal, Pan Fried Chives Dumplings were our favorite, and the best dessert is the Baked Sweet Cream Bun!  Although we love the Seaweed Salad, the portion size is so small, it's not worth $6.15.  Seven of us ate everything we wanted for a total of $82 plus tax. That's a pretty good deal! This is our favorite dimsum place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place this past Sunday. The service and quality was not worth my time and getting sick just made it worse."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Four people, no liquor, tip included $85. Food excellent. Service excellent.

{"text":"Superior dim sum all day and every day!!!! What a BIG surprise!  Who could ever expect this place to be in Las Vegas? Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!  I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too.   If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!  Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!  The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Vegas we try and stop here because it is so good. I like the fact that they open at 10:30 because sometime you need dim sum for breakfast  Get off the Strip and enjoy other parts of Vegas.....it's much better"}
{"text":"Never experienced dim sum before! I was kind of lost when I was seated. ;) Where's the menu?  What are all these carts rolling around?  I was with someone who helped me pick some great items and the servers were very patient and helpful too.  Everything I tried was delicious and our drinks were filled constantly.  Loved the shumai and coconut buns!  We ate a ton and felt the prices were great.  I will definitely be back! Update:  been here about 20 times since and it has never disappointed.  I've tried a few different places now and this is hands down the best Dim sum in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've never tried the menu food - I eat Dim Sum here every couple of months, and I thoroughly enjoy it. The steamed pork buns are my personal favorite, and the friend that usually goes with me likes the Shu Mai and the shrimp noodles. Prices are great, the cart rolls around frequently, and the food is always fresh whether the place is busy or not. The spare ribs are a bit fatty and greasy, and the one time I tried the fried squid, it was fairly chewy and a little oily, but everything else is delicious. The sesame balls are especially tasty!  While I've never tried to split a check here, I can imagine it would be problematic since Dim Sum by nature is food to be shared, and they just punch the card at your table when you ask for a dish. I guess if you really want to split a check they probably will, but if you're trying to keep your order separate from other people at the table, you might have trouble with it.  Love the authentic Chinese dishes, too. Definitely check it out. It's a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here after a long crazy Vegas weekend and it was the best meal to have before the long ride back to San Diego. I love dimsum and this place did not disappoint. It had all the basic dimsum plates and it is a big restaurant to seat big families and groups. We had great service and I really enjoyed eating here! I hope to come back next time when I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times with family since I was a kid. The service is like many of the Chinese restaurants in Vegas. BAD! Which is fine, since I'm used to it by now, but my last experience here made me never want to come back.  I decided to come here one day craving Dim Sum. It was the closest location to my school so I decided to pay Orchid Garden a visit. I went in, glad to see there was no line, made I contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before I was seated. I understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers, but I'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat me.  Once I was seated, I wanted ordered my usual Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chow Fun, and Shrimp balls; however, after being served cold shrimp balls and Siu Mai, I couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving. The 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if \"everything is okay\" or if there's \"anything I need..\" So I helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter, asked for the check, left no tip and walked out.  I highly recommend eating at Cathay or Chang's for Dim Sum. They are alot friendlier and the food is much better."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in town!!! The chow mein, fried shrimp puff, and steamed BBQ buns are my favorite. This place never lets us down."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first having dim sum outside of Chinatown in Cali, but this place beats some of them! The restaurant is massive and as soon as you are seated the dim sum carts are right there. I recommend trying to get a table close to the kitchen entrance (dim sum 101). The food was hot for the most part and anything my family and I needed it was given to us instantly. Great place to take the family."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Dim Sum Houses in Vegas. Usually very busy and in fact I have walked out on occasion because I don't like to wait in their long lines of hungry guests for a table. If you can hit it right and don't have to wait to sit down, you will have great dim sum at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"My brother and sister were in town and my brother's been wanting dim sum since we last had it in Orlando.  We were pretty excited to find that they served dim sum all day.  We had just experienced a dim sum restaurant in San Francisco that only served dim sum for lunch and we were expecting to have it for dinner. We were all first timers to Orchids Garden and have all decided... yes, we will be returning!  We came on weekday evening around 6:30. There was no wait and were seated immediately. The dining area was huge... we couldn't even imagine what it's like on a busy night. Aside from our table, there were maybe 3 other tables that were occupied. Once 7:00 rolled around, people started coming in.  We came at a really good time.  We devoured 21 dishes between the 4 of us. I don't know if that's average or excessive, but we were pretty hungry.  :P The food was a little on the salty side (for me, but no one else... some, not all) and the women behind the carts were a little pushy (which we expected from reading all the reviews), but still friendly."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, it's not the best I've ever had but it's affordable and hits the spot when you're in a hurry and craving dim sum.  What keeps me coming back is the service. It's pretty good compared to other establishments. There's literally no wait time. From the second you sit down, hot & steamy carts roll up with friendly servers, I like that. And they are very accommodating when you request an item that isn't already being served that day."}
{"text":"Lots of selection of dim sum. They serve it all day. I believe the carts stop at 3 and you order from the menu after that. Carts came around fast and everything we ordered was delicious. The restaurant is huge, great for large parties."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for dim sum!! The severs are very friendly with excellent service!!"}
{"text":"The dim sum on a Saturday early afternoon is meh, it had a below average selection for a Vegas place and that's saying something. We've been here at least six times on different days and different times. The lastest visit was on a fairly warm October afternoon. The best time to come is Sunday before 3pm because even though it's crazy busy they have the best selection, more carts and fresher offerings. When we arrived it wasn't busy, maybe six tables max. It was really warm and humid in there, I could see they had some box fans but didn't feel like any AC was on. I was wearing a thin t shirt and shorts, but was still feeling some perspiration :(  NOTE TO NEWBIES: familiarize yourself with the picture menu and prices, it's easy to get over zealous and pick out a bunch of stuff not knowing some are $7 a pop!"}
{"text":"When I want some dim sum, it's sometimes a dim prospect, especially if you're not in SF Bay, LA, or NYC Chinatown. Good dim sum in Vegas?  Heck yeah. I really like this place.  Dim sum can be bad if it's not fresh. But it is good here. A warning - you should get there before 1:30 or the number of dim sum carts hawked by their cart ladies declines after the peak of lunch.  They do advertise \"dim sum all day\".  So, you can order it on the phone or in person, and all of your stuff will come out freshly steamed or baked.  They do not take dim sum from the cart ladies for to go orders.   This is a free standing building off Sahara west of Eyeglass World. The decor and ambiance isn't something you'd wow about.  The bathrooms aren't the cleanest, and the parking during peak times (noon - 1 PM) can be a challenge.  But overall, it was a nice place to be when you want some dim sum as well as traditional Chinese food.  A lot of first time customers get a puzzled look when they cart ladies come by, but often by the end of their meal, they're hooked.    I don't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things our group loved.  We tried/shared all the different types of siu mai, egg rolls, har gow and  pork bun (steamed, baked).  Loved that gai lan, and enjoyed the porridge. We had their fried fish, noodles, and some desserts like custard pie, sweet rice cakes, sesame balls, and I forget the rest. We went  a1:15 PM so the stuff was pretty fresh and the little carts were still darting through the restaurant. Some of the ladies were hard to understand but it didn't matter as long as you could see what she had in her cart. We took what we didn't finish home.  But except for the desserts, they tasted much better in the restaurant.  Lucky for me being a sweet tooth, they made for a great after dinner snack.  Yummy  It's a hassle from where in OC I live to get to the decent dim sum places in LA county.  How I miss living in the SF Bay area where dim sum places in Oakland and SF Chinatown are plentiful and yummy.  But when visiting my relatives in Vegas, this is an excellent choice. Each plate of dim sum was about $2 each, plus or minus some change."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for the first time this evening.  It wasn't too crowded... Especially for a Friday night at 7pm.  We feasted on dim sum... Offered all day :). Freshly made, affordable.  We will return; probably trying out the regular menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum place just a little off the strip.  Large enough room that we didn't have any problem seating around 10 people pretty quickly.  Food came quick too and there is plenty or various dishes to choose from.  I highly recommend the crispy fried calamari, which has the legs... i love the legs!  I very much enjoyed everything I tried here.  Will definitely like to come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good, but make sure you keep track of the stamps they add to your bill if you do the rolling cart style. In my experience, too many stamps were added to my bill so we questioned it to the servers. It was corrected, but it's a slip up that can go undetected. I suggest to ask how much each order costs (which is something I haven't done, but will do) because it's not explicitly listed. Just an extra precaution to make sure you're not over charged."}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving dim sum after a 2+ week trip in the southwest.  Oh... my... dog...  So good!  Alright, this is definitely dim sum done the way I like it.  Despite a huge crowd of people, it took less than 10 minutes to get seated.  Clean interior and carts, definitely.  The food was all very flavorful.  Of special note were the turnip cakes, full of turnip and not too oily.  Everything else was great, too.  Not a single miss here.  I'm definitely coming back here to sate my dim sum cravings in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My buddy adores this place and I have gone with him a dozen times. One week when he was in town we went 3 times and I wasn't complaining.  Orchids Garden ticks the ethnic cred box (As in lot's of Asian people always eating here) My rule of ethnic food is simple, if you are eating Mexican food but there are no Mexicans eating, you're at Taco Bell.  Anyway, they have a crab ball that is just sumptuous plus all the other pot stickers and dim sum items and a full menu.  Eat here"}
{"text":"Not very friendly service, but adequate.  Pick your deem sum from the carts being rolled around the restaurant.  We went during the week and the selection wasn't as varied as we would have liked.  Authentic Cantonese dim sum in Vegas outside of their Chinatown.    The parking lot was actually full despite the restaurant itself being only a third full during the week.    A sign outside said dim sum all day.  I've heard of this trend."}
{"text":"Not seeing a problem here. From the bay area too. Came around 4pm and no crowds fucking love that. Hate crowds but love food. Food was good a Lil above average.  Overall price and quickness of carts plus ordered food didn't take long. Easy pessy dim sum"}
{"text":"Great dim sum for a great price. Have been here several times and have never been disappointed. There can occasionally be a queue. There is additional parking in the back."}
{"text":"Try something new for lunch my co-worker said!   Well, it was the worst meal I've had in Vegas, for a million reasons.  I made him pick up the check, because that's just punishment for this kind of idea.  Dim Sum was a D+ at best - this is compared to all other Dim Sums.  If you have to choose something, get the pork siomai.  It's a solid C-, so it's the best you're gonna get here.  The entrees (Why order an entree at a Dim Sum place?  Shame on me, I know.) were not edible.  I really mean it.  The fried rice wasn't fried and the beef... well, it wasn't beef.  If you have thin skin, or like clean dishes, go elsewhere.  The ladies on the carts would give you some serious stink eye if you didn't take their grade D meat.  And if you ask for a fork without any residue, more stink eye!    Worst chinese in Nevada.  (That's really saying something)"}
{"text":"The food is good kinda cold they sat the America's on the same role????? This is kinda weird all our money is green!!!! Lol besides that it's good food"}
{"text":"The city district closed the restaurant.it is too dirty.for 2-3 months.please confirm."}
{"text":"This Orchids Chinese Restaurant has been around for many decades. They are now serving Dim Sum in the evening as well.   Last nite, we went for dinner, NOT DIM SUM as dim sum is only for breakfast and lunch in the Chinese custom. Were we ever so disappointed.   There were three of us and we ordered two of their specials:  Pan Fried Seabass -- fishy taste, no flavor, unappetizing look. A total failure. Grade F.  Filet Mignon with asparagus - strange flavor, filet is too fatty. Grade C- The third dish is a tofu dish with seafood. What they mean by seafood is octopus. Minimal taste. Grade D+.   Service is disappointing, even for Chinese restaurant standard.   Very disappointing meal. Definitely not a place for dinner. We will not be back for dinner again."}
{"text":"Got here around 1pm and dim sum was absolutely delicious. Parking is limited. Service is slow at times. Coming and visiting Las Vegas, this by far is the best dim sum. Wait time is not too bad. It's about 10 to 15 minutes. Not too bad."}
{"text":"This is good dim sum, good variety but I think a little more expensive than Chang's.  They have 2 different kinds of egg custard tarts YUM!"}
{"text":"im not a huge dim sum fan, but everytime im in vegas, i find myself at orchid garden. the food is actually really good. the best dim sum ive had id say? i dont know. and for some reason, seems like everytime i am at this place, the line is always so long. but everyone was nice, and it was good!"}
{"text":"love this place.  we went at night once but it wasn't as fresh as coming during the day..  if I could name favorites I would, so I gotta start taking pics and posting them instead.  it's a pretty big place that can get really busy.. but their definitely on top of coming around and making sure your taken care of.  they are very friendly and accommodating and will take an order of dim sum for you If you for some reason missed it when it came around.  even though it gets really busy, it's big enough your not sitting on top of patrons next to you.  the wait is never more than 10 minutes...  and all the waiters and waitresses are super friendly.    I am very satisfied with the service here. it's my favorite dim sum place in vegas so far!"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is better than at Spring Mountain . The egg custard is small but delicious."}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum if you get there when they are busy. If they are not busy most dishes are cold or reheated. This happened to me on two occasions. When complained to waitress she heated in microwave. Service is usually good here. I will not return unless it is their peak period"}
{"text":"This is definitely a study in chaos. It took about ten minutes to get a table. We were hungry. My husband delighted in the pork buns, which had a delightful maple accent. I found them a tad sweet. The steamed chive dumplings were wonderfully savory. I found the calamari a bit greasy and off putting. The duck was tender, but not outstanding. The skin lacked that extra crisp texture. The shumai were fantastic.   Perhaps I'm being elitist, but I don't understand how any restaurant worth it's salt can't have fresh ground pepper.  Look for the full, hot, steaming carts. Few items=old and cold.  The service was what you would expect for dim sum. If you're looking for something more than descriptive, go elsewhere. The service is fast and the food is plentiful. Don't be afraid to say no, or you'll risk over ordering.  Definitely a place I'll check out again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good... I've been many dim sum places.. But not around Vegas.. This place is definitely good.. Great flavor and quality.. I have not tried ping pang pong Poo yet but dim sum places usually taste the same unless the food was really bad or left out too long.. As for today, my food is good and full feeling.. Lol I'm kinda buzzed too.. So don't take my word for it.."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. Partially because, lets get real, there are limited dim sum options here in Las Vegas. I was introduced to dim sum when I lived in the Bay area, so my standards are a little higher than your average bear.  Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM. Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.  We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).  Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were \"coming right out\" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.  We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside. Service was friendly and attentive throughout, other than that ridiculous wait for the soup dumplings."}
{"text":"eh, the service is okay. Dim sum is a sudden craving..I know going in im gonna get a grumpy waitress.. well actually just one in particular..  Fav is the shumai. I do get concerned about going here to often though, I know they've previously scored poorly on health code reasons."}
{"text":"Meh. For me, nothing special. Dimsum items: Shumai was good. Calamari was not good. The shrimp rice noodle was disappointing. Edible but blah! Menu items: noodles and lobster were good.   Overall, I think it's 2 to 3 star rating. I'm giving it a 3 since I wasn't able to try their other dimsum items. I'll probably come back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Duck had no aroma or seasoning what so ever. Tasted like they just tossed a plain duck in to roast. The sauce that it came with was bad also.  Terrible servers. Evertime they stop by to ask if you want something I would turn to order and they are already moving on.  I ordered some food from the picture menu and they said it was out... wtf on Wednesday at the start of dinner time at 530?  Had to keep flagging people down to make sure our food was still coming. The place was nearly empty and they acted like they had no clue what was going on.  How can they operate if it gets busy?  Just terrible overall experience."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Being located in Vegas, I wasn't expecting much out of a dim sum restaurant but this place really delivers.  Yes, there are better places in California but if you're craving dim sum and you're in Vegas, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Dim sum was average. For it being dim sum all day I give it a good 4 stars cause most places I go to (Santa Ana, California) they're only open for lunch. So it's understandable that they run out of stuff so they have to go back and get it and things like that.   The reason behind the 3 stars is for the young lady working the cash register. Rude when there was no reason to be rude. A group of 7 people were going to pay the bill separately and so we went to the counter to pay. Right off the bat was rude to me and my friends demanding tip when we haven't even said an amount yet and accusing us of not paying the entire bill when we were still a few waiting to pay.   Then which, proceeded to talk crap about us when we're still sitting there waiting for others."}
{"text":"Fast service but way too much MSG in their food... If you're not looking for authentic Chinese dim sum you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Craving dim sum? Unlike other Chinese restaurants who only serve dim sum in the AM, this place has got it all day. The carts keep coming, and there usually is no break in between them. Though some dishes are especially oily, it's mostly satisfying. They also have some of their entrees served in small portions on their dim sum carts. You don't even need to look at a menu. Always wash it down with hot tea!"}
{"text":"Pretty outside building, had very hot delicious baked barbecue puff pastry, great Chinese broccoli...stems on top with lots of leaves underneath. Tasty siu mai and shaolin dumplings, skin too thick. Oh and the last one, eggplant stuffed with shrimp was terrific."}
{"text":"Tho this place seems pricer than the LA places. It hit the spot..most likely won't be for dim sum....but their Beijing pork chops ...ohhhhhh yes...it came out to be something like $10 something ...that's all I had so if I return I will update later :-)"}
{"text":"The dinning room is spacious and accommodates large parties as well. Your regular Dim Sum dishes. We went about noon and there's was no steam pork ribs or spring rolls. The push cart ladies say 'wait...later' going about their rounds. They kept offering the beef short ribs which we already ordered. The food is good and reasonably price."}
{"text":"I really like the food,no correction, I love their food!!!, The price was reasonable,the staff were people friendly,and the atmosphere was chill for it to be a large eating area. I will be back again,and again. I have found my favorite spot to eat,down the street"}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum since leaving LA. The staff are fast to seat you and get your drinks to the table even faster if that's possible. The dishes were some of the best we have had outside of China. We live in Henderson so we travel a ways to get here (worth the trip). The carts come by frequently so there is always something for everyone. We have found the staff more friendly as of late which was a wonderful surprise. If you love Dim Sum give this place a try."}
{"text":"For LV, this place sure knows how to make good dim sum.  I've only been here once, and it was just as good (possibly even better) than Seafood Paradise in Westminster.  After a night of clubbing and drinking this really hit the spot.  1.  The place looks ok, I think they can fix it up a little, but it's not gross or anything.  Regular cloths, uncomfortable chairs, not too roomy to walk around.  It's not too bad, but definitely not a first date location.  2.  The service is pretty good.  They were attentative, fast, and courteous.  They brought us the dishes quickly and were eager to serve.  The water refills came every so often, and they brought us rice as well.  3.  The food was so fresh and delicious.  I don't know if it was because it was so fresh and I was hung over or if it is just the cooks there, but the food was PERFECT.  It was a perfect brunch for 12 of us.  We literally cleaned out all of their carts and the restaurant had to wait about 10 mins for more dim sum.  And once that came out, we did some damage to that too.  The total bill for us was $12.50 per person, and that's including tax and tip.  Seriously!  That cheap to feed all of us with delicious Chinese Brunch?  Win!!  This is definitely a great dim sum place for Vegas.  I'll hit this place up again for sure when I'm in the mood for something off the strip."}
{"text":"This is just an OK dim sum place who's saving grace is that they serve dim sum all day/night with a limited selection during off peak hours. Go to Ping Pang Pong instead unless you're craving shu mai at 10 pm."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. If dim sum makes you uncertain they have a very comprehensive regular menu. Generals chicken, while basic, is full of flavor.  Staff is excellent and very quick which is typical of legit Chinese establishments."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for Dim Sum for as long as I can remember. I always come for the Pan Fried Chive Dumpling, my favorite of all time. They give you a dim sum menu so you know what everything is or you can tell the ladies what you want & they'll send the cart over. They still come around anyway. If you don't see what you were looking for in the menu just ask. Some items are made to order. I just learned that actually on my last visit. You can also order from the regular menu if you want. The hot tea is good too."}
{"text":"The only reason I really go here is the fact that they have dim sum ALL DAY. I haven't found any other places in Las Vegas that do this [ if you know one, let me know =p].   It isn't the best dim sum I've had, but it satisfies me when I crave dim sum. Service ranges from bad to mediocre. One time, a lady was heading toward our table with the cart... but saw a bigger party seated two tables after us, told us to wait and skipped us to go to them, and then came back once she was finished at their table. It's also pretty hard to get them to refill whatever it is you're drinking.  They also don't clean underneath the tables once people are done eating. So if eating at a booth, be sure to NOT look under the table if you don't want to be disgusted.   Prices are what you would find at any other dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"This was very flavorful. I eat a lot of noodles ( so I know my noodles) and the chow mein was tasty. They had these dumplings with shrimp and pork we're also very yummy. The restaurant and bathrooms were clean. We got there early and it quickly filled up. Very reasonable price as well."}
{"text":"Perhaps I am unfairly comparing Orchids to the dim sum places that I've frequented both in SoCal and NorCal. But hey, I gotta call it how I see it. The dim sum is ok, definitely not the best I've had. But considering that this is Las Vegas and that there IS a dim sum option available, I would rather have ok rather than nothing.  Besides, they still use the old school carts that roam around the restaurant. Major props for that!"}
{"text":"The place was easy to find . The parking lot was small.  The restaurant  was about 40 40% full. Carts came frequently.  It was nice to have Restaurant  that served dimsum all day.the harrow was small but tasty. The rice  soup was Luke warm and  bland. The beef cheng fun was average but the beef needed for cilantro. We did like their white  turnip cakes which was very fresh. The barbecue  pork bun was decent but the meat was dry. Price was OK about  15 dollars a person"}
{"text":"One of the better places for dim sum in Vegas. Nothing fancy and a little pricey. You're standard large Chinese restaurant with dim sum carts. Usually not much of a wait, if any, to be seated. Dim sum carts can take a while to get to you, but at least you know everything is fresh as they're constantly having to restock. Definitely not the best dim sum I've ever had, but I'm finding it difficult to locate great dim sum in this town so this has been good enough."}
{"text":"Good food, though sometimes it is really hard to get good service at dim sum restaurants. I've learned that if you want a quick dim sum fix without having to wait for the food or deal with the usual service, I just go there and ask for take-out."}
{"text":"No thanks. Had dim sum here with the family. The har gaw and siomai was cold and the service was terrible. I saw 3 roaches around the table and I wanted to leave as soon as I saw the first one."}
{"text":"One of the best baked Cha Siu Baos (pork bun) I've had. Came here for dim sum, all of the steamed dishes were on point with the exception of the shrimp cheong fun.   Carts came around in a timely manner and prices were decent."}
{"text":"The food wss average, portions small, service was goodprice was reasonable . I did like  beef chow fun .we did not have to wait"}
{"text":"For those of you that think this place serves great dim sum: you need to know that dim sum is suppose to be served warm. We ordered about 8 dishes that are suppose to be warm, but not a single one was served any better than lukewarm."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I wouldn't come back even if it was free!!!  Yes... Three exclamation marks!! The food was not good, bland, poor quality and the service was extremely terrible.  It took 40 minutes to get our food (the dim sum was of course quick).  The servers were beyond rude by shaking their hands in our faces when we asked for certain dim sum.  Once our food arrived it wasn't even worth trying. We asked for our bill only to wait 20 minutes for it.  After finally getting fed up we had to get up and track down our bill.  I love trying new places n new things but I am so dissatisfied I am at a loss for words."}
{"text":"Dim sum all day, every day?! FANTASTIC. I think I just found my new favorite dim sum restaurant.  Came here with my boyfriend around 2pm on a Sunday looking to stuff our faces. I'm not a local and the Chinese restaurants in Orange County usually stop serving dimsum around 3pm. So I was sort of expecting the remaining foods and okay service. I was so wrong. I walked towards the restaurant and saw 'dim sum all day''. I was soooo happy!  The service is super fast and friendly! And it's cheaper than a lot of other Chinese restaurants which is awesome!"}
{"text":"My Sunday church.  The only dimsum I kinda go to in Vegas. It gets busy on Sundays. That's when everything is made fresh. So many people coming in, therefore, they need to keep making food.  I've never gotten sick form their food. But I've heard of stories. People just need to man up with their immune system.  Service is aighhhttt. Expect to not understand what they're giving you. Ha. All you have to do is point and eat. Parking does get itchy with a B on weekends. Cause that's when everyone shows up.  If you're hungover, this is your must stop."}
{"text":"I've had dim sum here several times. The service isn't great, but the food is decent. I always look forward to the egg tarts they NEVER seem to have every time I come here."}
{"text":"Noisy, crowded, unorganized . Who cares! This is Vegas. Food is good. If you want tasty dimsum, this is the place."}
{"text":"Strangely enough, last night's visit to Orchids was only my second time ever having dim sum.  I am a bad Asian.  A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck.   Pros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)    Cons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.  Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time."}
{"text":"Overall I believe this restaurant has the best dim sum in the valley. They serve it all day every day, but the best time to go for the most freshly made dim sum is Saturday or Sunday at lunch time. That is when they are most busy for dim sum. So it'll be a bit of a wait, but this is when it'll taste the best.   There are many restaurants in the valley that serve dim sum, but Orchids Garden (in my opinion) offers the widest variety of tasty dim sum dishes and the most authentic dim sum eating atmosphere.  Never be shy about asking the ladies pushing the food carts what they have. They may be hard to understand, but they WANT you to order stuff from them, so they will be glad to show you. Be brave and try things you normally wouldn't eat. You may be surprised by some new delicious flavors."}
{"text":"I like their chicken feet a lot. It melts in your mouth. The place itself is not so great but the dimsum is good enough but not exactly great."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Not only expensive but disgusting. I've had REAL dim sum in Chicago Chinatown for YEARS .. this place flat out sucks. Actually left hungry, and got sick soon after. My sister even requested all white meat for her orange chicken and they lied and said that's what they gave her. We had to point out the difference between white and dark meat. Big time disappointed.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in town! I'm Cantonese and this taste like home. The crowd waiting may seem like it'd take forever but turnovers are really quick with all the dim sum carts. The service is standard for a Cantonese dim sum joint so can't complain there"}
{"text":"Dim Sum all day is a great feature. Very flavorful, very warm. I have no complaints about it.   However, I ate dinner here and the food wasn't great. Everything was extremely flavorless. I don't know if it was intended like that so the customer could add seasonings to their liking, but the soup we got tasted pretty much like water. There was also a fried tofu dish that was pretty much tasteless, although the texture of it was nice.  Service is good. Waitress was friendly and accommodating for anything we needed.   I would come here again, but for dim sum only."}
{"text":"Good spot for dim sum. We went with a large group and we were able to be sat within a good amount of time. Its very busy on the weekends and we went during lunch time so I was surprised. The food was pretty fresh considering they sit on carts for a min before being served out.  Selection of food was pretty good, disappointed a few of the traditional dim sum plates were not brought around but I guess every dim sum restaurant is slightly different.   Service wasn't bad, maybe it was because we had a Chinese speaker with us but I have to admit that compared to most dim sum restaurants the service was a lot faster here than at most.   I would go back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get your Dim Sum fix.  Its certainly cheaper than places on the strip for the tourist...aka..me.  Having tried Changs as well, this place is a little better and a little more expensive than Changs but way cheaper than the wallet draining strip dim sum places. (Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian...etc)    Arrived here on a weekday at around 11am and plentiful seats was to be found. By 1pm the restaurant was 3/4 full. I imagine being busier on the weekends.   At least there was a selection of teas (Heurn Peen, Teet Goon Yum, Bo Lei...sorry for the ching-lish translation...lol) aka not the typical green tea,  tea bag in a kettle tea.  Ordered: Har Gow - Shrimp dumplings - 3/5 Sui Mai - Pork Dumplings - 4/5 - Pretty good Ha Cheung - Shrimp Rice Roll in Soy Sauce - 4/5 Dan Tat - Egg tart - 2/5 - small and custard was too firm/chalky taste Chow Mein - 2/5 - Oily but tasty Pei Dan Sow Yook Jook - 1000 year old egg, pork congee - 3/5 Jeen Dui - Sesame Glutinous Ball - 2/5 - wheres the filling? Boa Loa Bow - Pineapple Bun - 4/5 - Yum! Fong Jou - Chicken Feet - 4/5 - Tasty  And a veggie steamed roll ...name escapes me in both Chinese and 'engrish'...lol4/5.  Atmosphere was typical Chinese dim sum with a few yells here and there from the servers.  Don't usually recommend sitting by the kitchen anywhere else, but its a prime spot for dim sum restaurants as you get the first picks/selections and everything is steaming hot.  Total with tip was $35 for 2 people.  The selection was certainly there and could of tried much more...aka spring rolls, veggie dishes, stuffed green peppers, tofu dessert...etc but 10 dishes for 2 people was 'pant sized-up' enough...lol.  Certainly far from the best Ive tasted but passable to get your fix in."}
{"text":"DIM SUM ALL DAY! -- finding this place definitely makes me feel like a winner in Vegas. lol oh man, i get way too excited over food, but dont mind me.  It was pretty late in the afternoon when we were driving around off of the strip looking for a place to have some chinese food and then we find this place. We had a rather large group but they were able to accommodate us quickly, which was nice. The restaurant has many large tables and the service was quick. We had many order of the pork shiu mai, the chinese broccoli and dumplings! The servers were not pushy and they were all rather friendly. The price was decent too. I will definitely be back to Orchids when I have those late night dim sum cravings in Vegas. Or maybe when I have a hangover-- you know how that is."}
{"text":"OMG ! go to this restaurant for Dim Sum.  top notch quality. fresh, authentic and yummy. they are just west of Decatur Blvd. at South jones blvd. intersection. south east corner. you cant miss it.  and the staff are really efficient and NICE with a sense of humor. meaning they smile.  this is super good DIM SUM go and then thank me :)))"}
{"text":"The servers are really attentive to their guests. Always asked if everything was okay, came by to pick up finished plates, refilled my water 10 times cause I drink like a camel, even entertained my neice for a bit and also when she got fussy she gave her a chopstick. I love how they treat their guests. The food though is okay.  But I believe in the restaurant business half of what makes it great is their service,  and that's what makes them successful."}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to have dim sum for lunch, so we decided to go here. We were somewhat disappointed. The variety of dim sum dishes were limited - we had expected more. The steamed items were good; their chicken wrapped in bean curd was excellent. However, we found the deep fried items to be greasy. The deep fried calamari was actually just at room temperature, and the deep fried shrimp was rubbery. The crab claws were good. All in all, for the price I would have expected better."}
{"text":"probably the only place i come for dimsum. great prices and selections. they are always well staffed and you have dimsum carts always moving and restocking.  they have this coconut pastry bun. its the shiz, so good...  my favorite dimsum dish is the chicken feet."}
{"text":"Dim Sum all day!! ... was the only reason why I came here in the first place.  Pricing was a little more expensive than usual, and quality was a little bit lacking. Drove off the strip to find this restaurant but maybe we would've been better off at Earls... Just kidding, I guess it wasn't that bad (but it's definitely not great). When we came restaurant was a little empty, not that many workers pushing the carts around and it took 5ever before the steamed dimsum cart found it's way to our table. Ordered all the basic stuff, none blew my mind away. If this is all that Vegas has to offer, I'm a little sad. Next time that I'm back in SinCity, I'll hit up some other spots."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Dim Sum restaurants in Vegas in my opinion. I've tried pretty much all or most of the Dim Sum restaurants here in Vegas and this is one of the better ones. I mean its not fantastically good but better than the rest.   They do have Dim Sum around the clock but I would recommend going early - afternoon-ish just because the food is fresher because there are more people so they are preparing food constantly. Compared to going later when it is not busy, food can be sitting out for a while.  I would recommend going here or at least give it a shot."}
{"text":"My coworker brought me here for lunch today and it was yummy! Having just moved to vegas, I'm hesitant to try Asian restaurants unless I hear good things about them from people (or yelp!) because, well, you can get sick if they don't run a clean ship in the back kitchen. Luckily, this place is very clean.   Basically your typical dim sum place, which for all of you who don't know is kinda like tapas (small plates) of Chinese food. Servers come past the tables pushing carts full of food that you can choose from. They bill you at the end of the meal according to a little order card on your table, which they stamp/write on when you get each plate.   We had the chow mein (fried noodles), the choy sum (Chinese broccoli), shumai (pork meatballs in egg wrapper), shrimp balls, shrimp potstickers, char siu bao (steamed pork bun), chive dumplings, and the crab balls. Make sure you get those crab balls. They have a crab claw sticking out of them to identify them and they look weird, but they are sooooooo juicy and delicious. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had fried taro \"footballs.\" I'm from Hawaii and taro isn't something I'd expected to see in a vegas restaurant, so yay! (Taro is a starchy root vegetable similar to a potato. A staple in traditional Hawaiian cuisine. Not sure what they call it in Chinese.)   When in doubt, just point to what you want on the cart. Prices are reasonable ($50 for three hungry people, including drinks) so definitely venture out and try things!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So delicious and affordable. We always go here instead of other places because the food is much better. People are nice and they don't rush you."}
{"text":"All day dim sum and the food is tasty too. Just don't go too late or they seem to run out of certain dishes. Prices are reasonable and service is fairly quick. Sometimes if you ask them they will even make a dish that you don't see on the carts which is great!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his friend (and friend's wife). Being Chinese, from NJ, and having spent a good amount of time having dim sum in Chinatown, NY or in Queens, I thought it was pretty good. We had a lot of the familiar dishes -- ha gow , loh bok goh, cha siu bao, siu mai (steamed shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, steamed pork buns, pork dumplings respectively)-- as well as others that I didn't know (and unfortunately, I don't remember what they were). I thought they were decent.  We also had dau fu fa (it's basically tofu with sweet syrup) except that I never had it the way this place served it: hot and with ginger-flavored syrup. Maybe it's not even called a syrup; it's waterier than what I'm used to. It was good, but I prefer it the way I've always gotten it in Chinatown, NY -- cold and just with the plain sweet syrup. Their tofu was also already broken down.  When my parents got us this snack (from here, I believe: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fong-inn-too-new-york), it was whole, in a deli pint container because we usually got them to go. It came with a few disposable condiment containers full of syrup. We sliced up the tofu ourselves and enjoyed it cold.  One thing I thought was weird was that they didn't have any oyster sauce  (ho yau). What Chinese establishment doesn't carry oyster sauce?! When you order loh bok goh in NY, you get oyster sauce with it. They said they didn't have any, but they offered to give me hoisin instead. I said okay, I'll try it. I was reluctant to eat it that way, but I dabbed a bit on the first piece, tasted it, and found that my expectations for this new combination were correct -- it was gross. I finished off that piece and ate the other two plain. Maybe next time I go, I should bring my own little container of oyster sauce so I can enjoy the loh bok goh way I always have.  Other than that, a good experience. I may try Ping Pang Pong someday. Like someone mentioned in a review for there, the name didn't seem to indicate authentic dim sum was served, but that reviewer said s/he was proven wrong.  ..Bah, so mind boggling how a dim sum restaurant doesn't have ho yau. It's sacrilegious.  Man, I really miss being at home."}
{"text":"The venue is huge, but the dim sum sucks!   It's supposed to be dim sum all day long, BUT the secret to their success is to warm up the food sitting in the carts all day long.. in the microwave.  It is so apparent & obvious by the texture of the food, taste and smell.  However, I was dismayed to learn that when you actually order from the menu....it's not that bad. They do have really good egg fu yung, so an extra star for the item ordered off the menu."}
{"text":"Dims sum was fast - and good.  Highlights include the shrimp Hargow, chive dumplings, fried crab balls, water chestnut cake, gai lan (chinese broccoli), and pork & shrimp shumai.  we went on CNY - and ordered some new years cake and soup from the menu - so know that there is a full menu on top of the dim sum carts."}
{"text":"Har Gow , Shrimp ball are a couple of my favorite dim sum items.  Good for quick dim sum craving !"}
{"text":"Initially, it was just my husband's fave. Now, I'm hooked myself! We come every month AT LEAST. Good service. Price isn't bad. Food's good too!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum, reasonable priced. Many selections"}
{"text":"Orchids Garden is a clean, spacious & overall nice restaurant to go to for dim sum. The staff is much friendlier than at Cathay House and I like how they provide a dim sum menu so you know what you're ordering."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great, the service also good. Everyone made sure we had food on the table and refilled all our drinks very promptly  My party and I had a good time here and we will return"}
{"text":"Good dim sum in Vegas . Beats the other ones in the area .  Reminds me of dimsum in the Orange County / LA area.  Service was fast and tons of dimsum to choose . Barely beat the rush lunch at 1115."}
{"text":"Dimsums are good but a bit pricey... $4.00 average per order..... U need to at least order 2-3per person to fill up...   I just wish I can find a dimsum house like in queens, NY. $2.25 per order and the size of the serving is twice as much...."}
{"text":"I came here looking it up on yelp, and though the location was inconvenient because of the distance from china town, the food was still pretty good. I liked the egg tart, and the rice cake, and definitely would recommend the chow mein."}
{"text":"The shrimp balls are the bees knees!! I wish they had more places like this in LA, we got served really fast and the staff was friendly, LOVE the Jasmin tea, a little pricey but we only come here once every time we visit the city, and will keep on doing so."}
{"text":"Reading about the sanitation violations reported by inspectors kind of makes me feel like losing the lunch I just ate.  I can't understand how this place got three and a half stars; the only explanation that comes to mind is that Vegas isn't the prime place for Asian food, but I don't think it's that unreasonable for people to have taste buds, much less standards.  Orchids boasts of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that's the source of all its problems. It's near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food is usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here is oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat.   This has been the biggest disappointment yet, given my impression from Yelp. Peeps, please be more aware of what you're eating before you review."}
{"text":"Been visiting this place for several years and I keep returning because the food is good. The dining room feels a little uneasy as all the servers hardly speak a lick of English and they're all always staring and laughing and whatnot. I love their shrimp and crab claw fried balls but you're better off going with the shrimp ones as they're cheaper and taste the same. The shumai and steamed bbq buns are tasty. The fried noodles they have on the cart on a small side plate are tasty but WAY OVERPRICED! The dim sum cart ladies are pretty annoying and can easily ruin your dining experience. You tell them no after no after no and they still keep bugging!  I like to get my food to go.  The white sticky rice cake is pretty good!"}
{"text":"When we were here last year, we didn't like this place much. The service was slow, we waited for the Dim Sum carts for 5-15 minutes. I had to push the cart to our table... boy, I didn't think they run that fast after me... since they were so slow with the cart. =P   Food was ok, but I would recommend Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine instead."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but dim sum pretty much tastes all the same to me. Unless of course it's super nasty or they don't have a large selection.  This place is good cuz they have dim sum ALL day so you don't have to worry about getting their by a certain time. Plus they have their regular menu you may l order off as well.  Decent prices so you can good a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for lunch. The tea was excellent. Some of the cart pushers were a little too aggressive with their sales pitch."}
{"text":"Dim sum is just not good in Vegas. I would not come here again, but then again I probably won't ever get dim sum when I'm in vegas.   This place is dirty and not authentic."}
{"text":"Dim sum all day long....need I say more? I just love the rice wrapped in leaves and all of the yummy dim sum. A lot of selection. You know its good when you see tons of asians."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is soooo bad.  Chinese waitresses are more interested in their cell phone than customers.  Don't come here until service improves."}
{"text":"I miss Dim Sum. New Orleans is not a place to live if it's a staple in your diet. I loved the hustle and bustle of Asian familes and the harried staff. The dumplings themselves were good, the tea piping hot, but wished we had ordered some broccoli.  That is all."}
{"text":"Its hard to find dim sum in vegas when we tried it last weekend I find it ok. I enjoyed the chicken feet and thai tea. A little pricey for some of the food in the menu. We waited for the dim sum cart to come around and it wasn't that quick as everyone say. We will try this place again when we crave for it!"}
{"text":"We come here every time we visit Las Vegas (about once every 1-2 years). It is one of the better dim sum restaurants we have found in Las Vegas.  The dim sum was very good, but this time they didn't seem to have as wide a selection at lunch. Nevertheless, their buns, dumplings, and rice noodle items were very good.  I also liked their sticky rice and sesame balls. We will be back the next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place set the standard bar pretty high for dim sum!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese dimsum at reasonable prices. The Baked Sweet Cream Buns are FANTASTIC and should not be looked over. I have been coming here for years because it is just like the Dimsum I had in Taipei and I have never had a bad experience.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is great. I highly recommend eatting here."}
{"text":"Orchids was busy for Saturday lunchtime, but we had no problem getting seated (major plus).I like that this place has all-day dim sum... and I'm talking about the dim sum off the carts. Orchids offered a good selection of items, and they were pretty standard across the board in comparison to any other dim sum place you will go. We did order some specialty items, such as the crispy combo noodle. This had 4 different types of protein -- Beef, pork, chicken, and seafood."}
{"text":"This place is the worst restaurant in Vegas. Services, food, and dinning area are failed. I was surprised that  Health Dept shut it down SO LATE in July 2014.  My family was dinning there few times and the foods and services are getting worse and worse. I speak their language and hear they bad month their customers, who obviously dont understand Chinese. Services is the worst part, i have to go to their stations to get my tea cups after i asked for assistance about missing tea cups from our table. It took me few minutes to find 2 clean cups!   Yes, they serve dim sum all day, BIG DEAL! Those dim sum will stay in the carts until they are sold. The heat in those carts are weak, go figure how fresh they are. Be careful what they charge u on the check! We found couple times they over charged us on what we did not order.  We are going dim sum somewhere else nowadays. We will never return to this place unless it has a new owner. This will happen really soon. Mark my word!"}
{"text":"This place was super good! I've never been to dim sum and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. My favorite dish by far was the crab balls. THEY WERE AMAZING! I like how they have carts coming around all the time so you can just point at what looks good and try a whole lot without it being super pricey. Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"I usually go to places based off reviews and star ratings. My roommate made the suggestion so we decided to try it out. I can't believe I almost missed out on this place.   The service was good all around. However when our table got our last order from the menu, the dim sum cart stopped passing by... Our drinks were always full and that's always a plus.  The food was good too. I really couldn't be judgemental because I was really hungry and had no time to savor the moment. The dim sum was good I do have to say. However the wrapped rice was a bit too much on the portion side for me.  Mango mochi was for dessert and wasn't all that good. It tasted more like peach than mango.   $115 for 4 people is pretty reasonable for all the food we ordered.  Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this after two separate visits. Found this place on Yelp, we wanted to go somewhere different before church and the husband and I are happy that we did. The kids, not so much. But hey, it can't be their choice all the time so I say, suck it up boys, mommy and daddy wants to eat here. Party of 4, in a booth with a total of around $60. The second, we brought another family here, again before church. Party of 10, round table (was not happy about the location), total almost $200.   Ordered some fried rice right away. Ehhh, it's ok. But I want fried rice with all the food coming our way. Here we go!  1. Steamed bbq pork buns: Oh my Lordy, I was afraid I'd have to take my husband to UMC again, just like when we ate at this Cajun shrimp place on Jones. He would not stop ordering this that I had to tell him to slow down. When he likes something, he goes overboard.  2. Steamed pork shiu mai: My love affair with shiu mai started when I was pregnant with my first. The boys liked this too.  3. Shrimp har gow: I ordered this because it's seafood, mouth watering.  4. Shrimp dumpling: Anything shrimp, bring it over I shouted! J/k 5. Mushroom shiu mai: Get in my belly, I like mushrooms too. Thoughts running through my head... Stop the ordering!  I think I'm gonna stop right here, you get the idea right? We ordered almost everything after 2 visits and I know I will be coming here again. We were stuffed, mommy puts on her cardigan to hide the bulging.... Shame on us!"}
{"text":"The best dim sum in Vegas.  Have been going there with my family whenever we are in Vegas. The place is busy, so make sure you get there before the crowd.  It's close to the strip and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here again cause my friends wanted to come here. We came in a busy time. Which we got a table pretty fast 5 mins. The food carts was all out & pushing about. The food taste better. I'm not sure if it was because I was really hungry or maybe it was much fresher. I'll go with it was fresher cause it was busy. Hehee"}
{"text":"Dim sum is served hot and tasty and the carts just keep coming and the women are assertive and try to get you to order the dishes off the cart!  Must better experience this time around"}
{"text":"This place is totally convenient and they have all of my favorites. I like to get the friend taro with pork, bean curd, and sticky rice. Don't be afraid to try things because I have yet to find any dim sum that I don't love. Went for lunch and was seated right away and the service is good too."}
{"text":"My chopsticks on table was stained. Dim sum here is all day here which is the reason why I came. However, every dish is salty as heck. Food coma right after unfortunately and it was not worth it."}
{"text":"Finally, got to eat my dimsum here :) Food was good, it's the same taste at the other resto that I've been too yay!! Went to eat around 800ish , but they don't have the cart that goes around but that's okay, the mean thing was the food was good to my taste:) The place was nice and pretty clean to me of all the dimsum I've been to:)  Staff was okay , they are accommodating :)  The only thing that i want them to serve even though it's sort of late, they should have the food or dessert that the costumer want to eat;( so never get my dessert that night:( But over all, I'll give them 8 out of ten:) Parking was nice,just infront of the resto..."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum food but with a limited selection. There's probably about 6 carts being rolled around and they have the usual stuff. Delicious and inexpensive- win win right there! Nice atmosphere, nice people, and an inviting host!"}
{"text":"I came here for dimsum and it was slow service. The food was incredibly mixed some were terrific some disappointing. I would come back again this isn't San Francisco or NYC so I have to say this is very good for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place for me has the best dim sum! This is what you need to try if you're coming here for the first time... first off, baked pork buns! It is out of this world amazing! It has this tender bbq pork inside of a baked bun that has been brushed with some kind of glaze that makes it sticky! It taste like a Krispy Kreme donut pork sandwich! Sweet and savory. May sound weird but it's a must try! Next, their custard buns! Soft and moist buns filled with a custard cream inside and a little crisp on tops of the bun. Best desert ever! I can eat an entire order by myself! And then there are their fried noodles that have so much flavor but yet is so simple. Then the chive dumplings are also amazing with a little bit of soy sauce. These are literally my favorite things and  their prices are great! Try this place and try everything I recommended! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"My party of 4 was quickly seated on a Saturday afternoon. The carts had a good selection of everything we typically order.   Chicken feet Pork spareribs  Shrimp har gow Pork shumai  Fried Taro cake Fried Pork and shrimp wontons Fried shrimp balls on crab claws Rice noodles rolls with shrimp (banh uot tom) Bbq pork bun Chinese broccoli (cai lan) Congee (chao)  Everything tasted average, and some dishes lacked the finesse and flavor that we're used to from the CA dim sum houses.   The rice noodle rolls with shrimp weren't that great. It's upsetting since this is my absolute favorite dim sum dish. The noodle rolls were too dense. Also, sweet soy sauce was lacking flavor, it tasted watered down.   The bbq pork buns had a tiny bit of bbq pork filling, it was mostly bread.  The fried taro cake was greasier than it should have been."}
{"text":"Good food, clean restaurant, attentive service. Dim Sum all day, nice. First time I had chicken feet and it was really delicious. If you have had dim sum at San Francisco's Ton Kiang, the dim sum will taste average to good."}
{"text":"We got into Vegas very early and so we decided to get some dim sum for breakfast. Though this place is a bit further away from the Strip, it was worth it!!   This place was packed, plus a lot of customers were Chinese. Which to me means one thing, this place doesn't suck. We sat down, and instantly the carts were roaming around our table. There were a great variety of dim sum and it was pretty good. We also had great service. Our tea pot was always full and our water cups were never empty.   Overall, I would definitely come back for dim sum. The food was good, service was great, and price was affordable.   P.S. - I went to Ping Pang Pong a few days later, and that place sucked balls (service and food is horrible). That place can not be comparable to Orchids Garden. Orchids is 10 times better IMO."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that it's not a REAL dim sum experience unless the little asian ladies pushing the carts around are incredibly pushy and loud about their offerings. And Orchids Garden does not disappoint. If you think I'm being sarcastic, you're wrong. i'm not. I genuinely believe that a proper and authentic dim sum experience involves some dingy chairs and loud, pushy little asian ladies.   The food is pretty good, not AMAZING, but authentic and DIM SUM ALL DAY!!! i ONLY took one star off because the one thing that every dim sum place should get right is those little flat shrimp rice wraps that they douse in that vinegar sauce? I don't know the name, but surely you know what I'm talking about... anyways, those should always be amazing and here they were a little bland.   The only thing is that unless you live in Las Vegas, rented a car or have a friend with a car this is pretty hard to get to because it's definitely not on the strip and is actually a little far from the strip. worth it if you want to get some good chinese food. also its REALLY CHEAP. i was with a bunch of people and we split it but i ate a ton of different variety stuff and my check was $10."}
{"text":"We went around 6ish. ....Some of the food was room temp.....Overall food was good BUT the workers there were so rude.....they are so snippy! ! We came in and ask for a booth since they weren't super busy yet they gave us the biggest attitude. ...and while dining I can feel them stare us down.....With that kinda service I usually don't come back but the food is pretty good so I'll come back for that"}
{"text":"The best dim sum in Vegas! This place is always so busy in the mornings and there is a good reason! Some of my favorites include shu mai, chicken feet, chives dumplings, and the egg pastry! The main dishes are flavorful and aren't too salty. The chive dumplings are different than any other dumplings that I have had and are really tasty, even if you don't love chives normally. The egg pastry has a great filling to it that isn't too sweet and is perfect for an after meal treat.   The salt and pepper lobster dish is a good splurge dish too! The lobster is prepared well and the seasoning isn't too salty but isn't too bland either.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is just like any other dim sum place. It's a great place for families. The staff and service is great too!"}
{"text":"This place is in a word- AMAZING! The best dim sum you will ever have!! I know I'm biased growing up eating at this restaurant but it is seriously the best dim sum I've ever had and will ever have. I've eaten dim sum in San Francisco and nothing can beat the taste or price of orchids garden dim sum. Like ever. I think my mom and I had at least 8 plates plus imported Tsingtao beer. wanna know whats cool? it was all under 50 dollars. Great price for AMAZING food. A goal of mine one day is to try all of the plates they have!  So in a nutshell: come here, spend all day being a glutton eating the tasty bits of heaven, leave sated and happy! :D"}
{"text":"Given that this is an Asian place, it has the poorest customer service of them all!! We understand how we gotta wait for the dim sum carts to make its round to us, but waiting 20 min. For our hot tea to come and 30 min for the first cart to come around is ridiculous! We waited for another 45 min for the chicken feet cart to come and asked the ladies multiple times for chicken feet and she says no more you gotta ask the ladies in orange. We've asked around and nothing! I don't understand why they can't just get it for us. It's a ridiculous wait for food here and will not come back EVER! Do not recommend! I don't care what day or hour it is I will never step foot in there again! Horrible experience! If I can give this place no stars I would, but I'm obligated to give something since I can't write a review without one!"}
{"text":"Loved that this restaurant serves dim sum all day. The Chinese Broccoli was cooked very well that day, not over or under done. For some of the ladies in my group, it was the first time they had dim sum, so it was a good experience. And the pricing was good as well.   Good, cheap, eats. I'd go again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Every visit to Las Vegas includes a.visit to this restaurant to enjoy the delicious food. Favourites include their sweet sour fish, baby bok choy in garlic sauce, filet mignon with asparagus, and so the list goes on. Super pleasant staff. Prices are reasonable for the quality you receive. Easy parking makes it a pleasure."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in town,, we make time to go here for Dim sum n just take a break fr buffets. I luv their coconut bread"}
{"text":"Best dim sum AND service I've EVER had. Highly recommend!!! The pork buns...amazing! The shu-mi was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"We were trying to change up for dinner and find some Dim-Sum. We followed the recommendations to come here. Restaurant was a little warm inside and they had floor fans going to get a breeze going. The carts we're going around and sometimes were infrequent in between. We got a couple of selections that were a little on the cold side. We got one variety of a 'shark-fin' style dumpling that was under-steamed and the wrapper was raw on the edges. The meal was just OK and I am sure it might be better during lunch period, rather than late in the evening."}
{"text":"Their dim sum is the best.. The price is just about right.. Food is good but the server  is snob and can be mean sometimes."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is decent, but it's the only dim sum we've gone to while in Vegas. The workers (cart pushers...ok that sounds bad...servers?) constantly push you to order what's on the carts. The cai lan (chinese broccoli) is already steamed and sitting in a cart with windows....I find that odd, but I love this dish so much I ordered 2.  The food is OK compared to other dim sum places I've been to. The place is pretty clean and very roomy. The service is quick and practical. The wait isn't long (about 5 minute wait) and our party of 10 ended up paying approximately $14 bucks per person! :)   Great deal for all the Chinese food we ate. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in town and need something to fill up my hungover self.   The new years candy (milky strawberry candy) is deeeeelish! Grab a handful as you depart the restaurant! I wouldn't know where to find it for the life of me."}
{"text":"WORDS THAT DO NOT GO TOGETHER   Discount & Sushi  Freelance & Gynecology  Refurbished & Pacemaker   And most recently... DIM SUM & ALL DAY   As soon as I heard it was an all day dim sum place my spidey sense went berserk. I tried mentioning other options like Noodle Palace, KFC, or even cyanide...but I didn't want to be rude to the birthday girl so off we went.   1st Impression: It's 2pm on a Friday...this is SO not the time to go for dim sum.   2nd Impression: Overflowing trashcan as soon as you walk in. ***getting nauseous***   3rd Impression: The smell of rancid oil. ***Mental note not to eat anything fried and getting more nauseous***   4th Impression: I bit down into a COLD piece of siu mai. ***Thinking happy thoughts to hold back chunks***  5th Impression: 'Why aren't we leaving?', I think to myself as we proceed to order MORE food.   6th Impression: 1/2 the food that we order is cold and we are forced to ask the cart lady to get us hotter trays from the bottom of the cart ***Thinking about where I can locate and Epipen and wondering why we're still there***    In summary: This is one of the nastiest dim sum places I have EVER encountered. As I predicted, all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (e.g. har gao, char siu bao, etc.). If you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like, don't like yourself very much, or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in. Otherwise, avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Keep coming back!!!!!!!!!!!  Always satisfied! I cant leave vegas without eating here!  Love this place Worth it! Fast service!  :))"}
{"text":"Being from TX, I have a serious hankering for some dim sum when I'm out West.  Despite that, and reviews from yelp, I found myself at Orchids Garden with a less than satisfied experience.  Had a decent variety of dim sum and have to say that it's mediocre at best.  Some was not worth the calories.  Seemed that the overall issue is the quality of ingredient.  Start with bad product, get bad final product.  Food was essentially tasteless.  Texturally ok but I wouldn't return.  Bathroom smelled bad too.  Surprised at the reviews noting their cleanliness.  I didn't see it.  3* only out of the goodness of my heart."}
{"text":"Orchid Garden has the BEST Dim Sum ever...you gotta go check this place out!"}
{"text":"this one not even deserve for one star !  after talking to this lady manager , she is so unpolite  we are trying to book over 100 -200 + ppl , bring in more business but this lady is ridiculous refused to help us out !    - bad customers services -no one care about you in the restaurant  -food not fresh  -dirty kitchen  -bad attitude  -worst restaurant in las vegas  - never ever come back to this restaurant  -worst services in any kind type of restaurant  people should banned this one forever !!!!!   just go near the kitchen area ...i am sure you wont go any more ! sick sick sick sick place  over priced , over priced ! cant even get a nice quiet meal without seeing something stupid !"}
{"text":"If you're craving Dim Sum and you're searching for a place to go, this place will do. It will satisfy your craving, but it's not the best. The restaurant is large, so you typically do not have to wait that long to be seated and it's good for large groups. They have all your typical Dim Sum dishes that you love, but overall I've had better. This might be my go-to Dim Sum place in Vegas, but I know of places in Cali that are amazing in comparison.  If you don't know what Dim Sum is- it's like Asian tapas food. Little bite size chinese food that is wheeled out to you on little carts. You just point to the ones you want and they drop it off on your table and stamp your table card to keep track how many dishes to charge you for. Most of the time I don't know the name of any of the dishes, so I just point at the ones that look tasty and give them a try. That's that best way to experience Dim Sum for sure."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ever tried this restaurant. The first time was roughly around 16 years ago when I was small child. I didn't remember much except that we didn't get sick. (Insert drumroll here! )  So I tried it out again with my mother today and I have to say the food was not bad. It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent.  The service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.  There are many other amazing Chinese restaurants as well as Chinese fusion restaurants and Thai restaurants in town but I feel more comfortable eating at. I tried this place because it's a little relieved .1 miles from my house. But I don't think I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"The food here is always great!  Dim Sum with the carts (and not just off a menu), plus they have a regular menu available as well.  We've been coming here for many years.  Occasionally we have a little issue with the language barrier - but overall it's usually a good experience!"}
{"text":"Very basic dim sum as compared to SF or HK. It does it's job and satisfies the craving a bit. Ambiance is gloomy and service is lacking. The bill fits the budget so we'll come back if we have a craving for some simple dim sum dishes. I wouldn't take your HK or Chinese out of town guests here. Btw, the pan fried noodles dishes aren't bad!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon (around 1 PM) and the left side of the restaurant was packed; I don't think the right side was open.  Despite the number of people, we did not have to wait to be seated at all.  It has been YEARS since I've had dim sum in an actual dim sum restaurant so I was excited.  It was my companion's first time (ever) to a dim sum restaurant, and I think he liked it.  I gave 3 stars because there were a lot of carts and a lot of different items to choose from, but not very many just meat or just veggie options.  We were seated quickly and our water and hot tea were brought at promptly as was our plain steamed rice (for my semi-picky 2-year old)  Also, a lot of what we ordered was a little greasier than I expected it to be.  I don't know the exact names for the items but I'll try my best to describe them.  CHOW FUN: I think that is what the lady called it.  I'm used to chow fun being flat noodles cut finger-width and quickly sauteed with some meat and veggies and soy sauce.  This chow fun was kind of like one big sheet of rice noodle rolled up, then sliced into 1-inch logs and cooked in oil, soy sauce and chili.  Whatever it was, I liked it and would definitely order again.  FRIED CALAMARI: Crispy, chewy, crunchy with a little spice (from a small amount of diced jalapeno).  It was alright.  I've had better and I've had worse.  My daughter had fun eating this one.  PORK BUNS: We had two kinds. One steamed and I think the other was baked with honey on top.  Both had a sweet red pork filling.  I liked the steamed version while my companion preferred the softer, sweeter, baked version.  TURNIP CAKE:  Kinda mushy, warm and Turnip-y.  It was how I remembered turnip cake to be (only back home they would fry it to order in front of you).  My companion did not care for it, but it reminded me of home.  I guess its an acquired taste, or a textural preference.  EGGPLANT WITH SHRIMP PASTE:  I don't know if this is steamed or fried.  The shrimp part was alright; the eggplant was a little greasy and under-seasoned.  The server added a little mystery sauce (soy reduction or oyster sauce...I don't know) but that didn't really help.  PORK SHUMAI: tasted like shu-mai? Kind of like the calamari: I've had better and I've had worse.  CREAM  PUFF: that's what they called it.  It was a soft baked bun filled with a small amount of plain whipped butter and topped with shredded coconut.  We were disappointed.  It was alright, but not what we were expecting.  EGG TART: simple egg  custard baked in a puff pastry shell.  My personal favorite... a little skimpy on the filling, but I didn't  mind.  SESAME BALL:  it was just ok.  Crispy on the outside and semi-sweet on the inside.  The rice paste came out a little mushy/pasty instead of chewy.  The table next to us had some fried chicken wings but none of the carts we saw had them.  I did see some chicken feet pass by, though.  I'd come back again...but I'd probably ask to see a menu, too...Just in case."}
{"text":"If you're in need of a dumpling fix, PLEASE do check this place out. It's a definite must for dim sum!! You never have to worry about waiting for food because the steaming carts come around consistently. Some higly recommended dishes would be pork shiu mai, shrimp har gow, spinach dumpling and bbq pork bun. The dim sum selection is pretty wide-ranging and includes just about everything you'd expect. Ofcourse,  specializing in the Cantonese classics. As for dessert, the sweet cream bun is an absolute fav. ! These homemade steamed buns are soft and tender with just the right amount of sweetness. Not only is this restaurant affordable but their food is top quality."}
{"text":"Best place for dim sum in town!!! Not that expensive, but good food...truly a locals place.Truly love this place...and also it's ALL DAY DIM SUM, who doesn't like that!! The shrimp dumpling in this place is very good and if you are really adventurous try the chicken feet! Hmmmm.....chicken feet.... For dessert I recommend the pineapple bun...(it's not really pineapple flavor but it is yellow so its called that...) very sweet bun with yellow filling!!)"}
{"text":"We come for dim sum Usually at lunch time When it's real busy.  But, it ensures that The dim sum is not sitting In the cart for long.  I'll get the beef tripe, Sharkfin, har how and shiu mai; Shrimp ball, white rice and  Chinese broccoli. Always get two orders of The baked sweet cream bun.  I'd take one to go And pop it in the oven As soon as I'm home.  Nice atmosphere, here. Good rotation of carts too. Go for lunch prices."}
{"text":"Dim sum places almost never have a high rating but this place was neither worse nor better than any other place I've been to--so 4 stars it is. We came around 9 or 10pm on a Sunday and it was great because they serve dim sum on carts all day. They were missing some of the dishes we wanted, but I expect that's because it was so late at night. The turnip fried cakes and the fried taro had to be ordered and made so it took about 20 minutes to receive those. We ordered shumai, shrimp balls (they're the same if on sugar cane or the crab claw), and two orders of chicken feet. All in all, including tea, it came out to be $40 for 3 people."}
{"text":"We came here due to a recommendation from our waiter the night before. He said \"opens late, but cheap!\" We were excited for some cheap dim sum!  This place serves dim sum all day and also has plenty of carts rolling around constantly! I've been to many places where they only have a few carts and they barely pass my table, but this place was awesome! We got a good amount of dishes - probably around 15 and it came out to ~$50!!! What a deal!   The food was pretty good and we enjoyed what we ate. It was all freshly steamed and piping hot. We will definitely be back again for their dim sum if we're in town!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with some friends and was not disappointed! Compared to ones I've tried in Henderson, this place is great in terms of cleanliness, speed, and food.   The restrooms as well as the dining area is very clean and that's something that I always looks for when entering a place that I know deals with a lot of people...and lots of oil/grease. (It's Dim Sum!)   Speed: there is a wait, especially when going for lunch like we did, but within 20 min we were seated and the food came right to us. Barely gave us time to order drinks, which was fine because we were starving! There were always carts coming and and out, and although those who pushed the carts were hard to understand or wanted us to hurry, they were efficient and getting around the restaurant.   Food: love the variety of foods both fried, steamed, etc. Good variety of salty (shumai, dumplings, sticky rice, shrimp balls, etc.) and sweet (sesame red bean balls, custard tarts, etc). Tasty and delicious!   **Also, if you don't like what's coming around, they have a menu that you can order from!"}
{"text":"I came to this place years ago because it serves dim sum all day long...well if it's not busy that dim sum is pretty ick :-/ I came back recently on a Sunday afternoon and the food was spot on :-) So moral of this story....only eat your Dim Sum here during the busy time ;-)"}
{"text":"This was the first and only all dim sum place I've been to in Vegas and have been really lazy to venture out into something else. It's opened 24 hours and parking isn't horrible, but can sometimes get packed during weekend afternoons. Sometimes guests are turned off by the aggressive nature of the people handling the carts, but I completely get it, it's their job. I just smile and say \"no thank you\".  The dining room is huge, so even if there is a long wait, the wait isn't so bad. My favorite items are the BBQ pork buns, custard buns for dessert and the fried shrimp dim sum that you can completely engulf in the yummy mayo sauce they have. They do have a regular menu you can order off of too, if dim sum isn't your thing. If anyone has any other good dim sum recommendations in the Vegas area, please let me know :D"}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon. Got there at about 1:30, had to wait a little bit (15 mins) to get seated. It's not too bad of a wait because food comes right away once you are sat.  I like the variety of authentic dim sum here.  They seem to be pretty fresh and tasty.  We went there a little late so the congee was sold out.  :( Probably have to go back earlier some other time. Staff were friendly, especially the ladies pushing the carts. Price is reasonable, will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently recommended I try the Dim Sum at Orchids Gardens being I'm a huge fan, and today was the day. Now, let me start by mentioning I'm a huge advocate for Ping Pang Pong inside the Gold Coast. Past the cheesy name and the location I think it serves up some serious Dim Sum.   Orchids Garden however, was basically Ping Pang without any cons. The Dim Sum was supurb. It was a constant stream of different dishes being sent out every five minutes. Everything I recognized from the shrimp dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and Coconut Pastries to Fried Calamari, Clams & Mussels, and even Fried Shrimp covered in noodles.   Every single dish was equal or above the quality Ive experienced at Ping Pang, or Cathay House, making Orchids numuro UNO on my list of must try Dim Sum. I cannot wait till next Tuesday for more Dim Sum @ OG's :)"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff, worse than all other Chinese food places I've been. Food was disgusting I literally got sick after I ate here. Just plain crap, go to china one instead they are nice and have good food"}
{"text":"4-5 stars: The place is clean, easily accessible off  Sahara (major street), and has a huge parking lot, so parking is not a problem.   3 stars on food.  Althought the food was good, it wasn't the best i have had. Maybe the biggest part of the reason is because the food were cold, well the ones meant to be served warm anyway.  My daughter (12 years old) and I went for dinner 2 nights ago.  I spent about $40, on 7 different items from the carts and 2 ice teas. i got: -chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (nice serving) -shu mai (4 pieces) - shrimp dumpling (4 pieces) - pork bun (2 pieces) -shrimp ball (2 pieces) -custard pastry of some sort that reminded me of mini custard pie.(2 pieces) -shrimp cake on green pepper  I will probably have to try during the day maybe the food will be warmer next time =)"}
{"text":"There's dim sum, every day, all day. That's the best part of it. The selection varies depending on how busy the kitchen is. They have chrysanthemum/flower tea and good chili sauce. The service is par with other dim sum places. I've eaten here plenty of times and ordered take-out regularly, mostly because it's close to my house and on the way home from work. I've seen people unfamiliar with the way dim sum restaurants work, walk out of here angry, but it's not that bad. It's not the best, but it's good enough and close enough for me to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Its dim sum tonight at Orchids. Another night of eating with family and friends. Group of 14, luckily it wasn't a busy night. They sat us right away putting two round tables together.  We ask for a round of water and hot tea. Then here comes the cart. This place serves dim sum all day which I thought was very interesting but at least when i crave for dim sum in odd hours i know where to go. We started with an array of foods...like their chow mein x4, shrimp dumplings, shu mai x4, beef tendons x2, lup cheong in steam buns x5, Chinese brocolli x3, fried chives, fried shrimp balls, chicken feet, seafood bean curd, shrimp fried rice x2, fried taro, roast duck, calamari x2, mango pudding, rice cakes x3 and so on. I can honestly say by far it is way better than Dim sum cafe in hualapai. The staff was nice and attentive, and no pressure in ordering foods. The food was flavorful and not bland.   Most definitely we will be back here. I deducted a star because I'm still on a mission who has the best dim sum in Vegas. So far, this is on the top of my list. Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is average here, I have yet to try any items in the lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great local dim sum place, a bit north of the traditional China town area. The menu covers all the basics, plus a few semi-adventurous items for those who have never had dim sum before.  The quality has been very good every time/day I've eaten here, and I'm happy to have gotten my girlfriend addicted to dim sum as well."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre here at best. Don't come here if you don't want to be treated like crooks ! As we are walking to pay the lady screams across the room to a waiter in chinese to \"watch us\" these waiters need to be properly trained on manners and customer service. Next time please make sure the customers you are \"watching\" do not understand chinese. Also these waiters are not trained on on proper sanitation. He had his fingers in our cups and refilled our drinks right after he was done cleaning a table. Orchids garden will be losing 6 customers. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Been here many of times every time I'm in town. But I never encountered such horrible service since today! Yes it's Chinese restaurant and what will I expect right?, and No, I am not stereotyping all Chinese restaurants, but this particular one for sure is the worst and beats all the stereotypical Chinese joints! Not just the language barrier but gees, the stinky attitude, the napkins that I requested since I sat down over an hour ago, the response I am getting. Now how the hell do you expect people to keep coming back here? Or Write a positive review? For the last 8 years I've been dining here, I will not be coming back here again!!! They probably don't even have a green card? Just saying... Be careful! I caught them adding items that I never ordered and receipts are in Chinese writing! And the cashier will also yell at you for their stupidity!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for 2 reasons. One being the dim sum is great! The other is the people working there have the worst attitudes. No smiles. Always seem like theyre in a foul mood. So I have no shame in putting a big fat \"0\" on the tip line."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in Las Vegas??! ...No way! OMG this place is delicious! From the honey walnut shrimp to the pan fried Hong Kong noodles AND alongside pick and choose from DIM DUM ALL DAY carts.. you cannot go wrong with this place. Aside from how dull the restaurant looks inside and out, you definitely would not expect very tasty hot plates coming out of the kitchen. My ultimate fav Chinese restaurant is in Westminister, Ca at Seafood Cove (which I have yet to write a review) and Orchids Garden reminded me of the flavors that trigger my happiness and feeling of a fully content tummy... but a plus here... remember the ALL DAY DIM SUM? Just an extra bonus to add to the goodness to traditional Chinese entrees with your family. Ever in the mood for inexpensive full flavored Chinese food? You must try try try!"}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum. Nothing special.  Cathay house is still my favorite."}
{"text":"My eternal search for the perfect Dim Sum in Las Vegas. I had found a really good one, but then they closed.  So, with a friend visiting from San Francisco (The land of AMAZING Dim Sum) we decided to try Orchids. Definitely this a favorite for many, it was packed! Although we did not wait long before being seated.  Once seated the food started to come by. The service was good, the dim sum was good. There is not a lot of selection in what comes by, but it was good. I would go back for sure. Maybe choose a bit more slowly to see other options? Because we all know the minute we are done with the meal, the amazing stuff starts to walk by!!  - You know it is true!!! LOL"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to get your dim sum on in Sin City.  Took my old school parents here and they loved the place.  Ate here late on a Monday afternoon and it was plenty crowded with folks chomping down on dim sum.  The prices are pretty cheap compared to SJ.  Really enjoyed the chicken feet and XO noodles!  The place is huge and there was no waiting.  The service was pretty good.  This place is not the Bellagio, but it is priced accordingly also :)"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. Ordered to go a bunch of times. The food is pretty good if you're hungry. Can't say it's to die for. Servers could be a little more enthusiastic, but then again, they probably have other dreams they'd rather be following."}
{"text":"This is my sisters favorite dim sum place and it sits on my top 3 list.  Everything is fresh and there's a good variety.  We always get the steamed and baked pork buns, rice cake, shrimp rice noodle rolls, tofu pudding, spare ribs, tripe, taro cake, egg custards, shu mai, crystal shrimp dumplings, pineapple custard buns, mango pudding, my aunt likes the meatballs and the fried taro balls.  My sister always orders take out so she doesn't have to make breakfast for the kiddies the next morning.    The pricing is based on the plates and compared to other dim sum places it's not the cheapest but the quality of food is there (big whole pieces of shrimp).  We get so full off the dim sum that we haven't really tried any of their \"regular\" dishes but we always see ppl ordering the pan fried noodles which always look so yummy."}
{"text":"We have not been back to Orchids Garden for quite a while and still found it to be good.   We went Sunday evening around 6PM which I would not do again and not suggest you do because it was not busy and so there were not as many dim sum carts and they were slow in coming around.  Some of the food was not as hot as I would have liked it to be. Other than that we enjoyed it.  My favorite is shrimp har gow and it was hot because we had to wait for it to be made.  We also had chow mien, fried shrimp ball, fried shrimp puff, crab claw and steamed shrimp dumpling which was just ok.  For dessert I always have the baked egg tart and it was delicious.   Had my dim sum fix for a while."}
{"text":"Nice place for quality and reasonably priced dimsum.  Restaurant  is older, but has a comfortable, large dining room."}
{"text":"I haven't found another place like this in Vegas, so there really isn't any other place to compare it to.  It's a dim sum place that serves everything like you would find on the streets of Hong Kong.  These carts come around with steamed dim sum and you choose what you want, as much of it as you want.  They also have a regular menu for those who shy away from cart food or dim sum altogether.  I tried their menu and it's decent but isn't the best I've had.  Overall, great place for some good eats when you're on a time crunch and want some dumplings.  I like it, and it's very popular, but unfortunately I cannot say that I'm a fan nor is it as good as it gets.    To be honest, I like the shumai at Noodle No. 9 in Caesar's Palace, but for any other type of dim sum this restaurant has it.  You want dim sum?  Try here.  It's fun dining!"}
{"text":"Yum!  My first dim-sum experience (so if you're a huge dim sum connoisseur take this review with a grain of salt.)  This place was recommended by a few different friends.  Service was quick and friendly.  I was prepared to be rushed and not know what anything was but they actually told us what everything on the cart was (it wasn't busy....and us gringos didn't understand everything but tried most of it anyway).  It's good to know for your first time that the most expensive cart comes out first...but that's where the good stuff if!  The crab and shrimp balls we got were yummy.  The wonton (? i think?  It looks like a haystack) wrapped shrimp ball was my fav!  I'd return again."}
{"text":"Compared to the other Dim Sum restaurants in Las Vegas, this place is the best so far. The Dim Sum here taste very good and the portion is ok. The reason why I gave 4 stars is because some Dim Sum entries are very salty."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended. We came here for lunch. They seated us quickly in this huge dining area.  Food is really good. We had seconds on the shumai and beef ribs. The best shumai!We also ordered other items like calamari (light and crispy batter), shrimp peppers (delicious!!!) fried shrimp, shrimp with eggplant (didn't quite get the combination with eggplant.)  I'm definitely going back to taste the other treats.  I also noticed a lot of buns rolling away. Next time... I can understand comments of bad service but luckily our group did not experience it. They were consistently pleasant and attentive. The service was quick, rolling carts kept coming with all these delicious treats. Dim sum all day!"}
{"text":"My son wanted to give me a late Mother's Day treat, so he and my daughter chose this place. It was actually a \"fullfilling\" treat. Although I'm spoiled from the dim sum joints in the Chinatown in SF, but I must say, this will do for me while here in vegas. I didn't yet try any of dishes from their meal menu, but got to try off of their dim sum menu & the carts that would come by our table, that we got quite full so we didnt even think about venturing off the meal menu nor desert! Lol The service was quick & good. They kept our beverages full too. Ooowee! Ok I cannot type anymore bcuz I'm still full! Lol we were too hungry to even take pictures! Lmbo for sure we'll come back and especially they're in the neighborhood to where my daughter & I stay@. I just wish they deliver but ooowee! That's ok! Thank u smooches"}
{"text":"Dim sum is the best hangover cure, and nothing screams Vegas like all day dim sum.  Orchids Garden serves dim sum from 10:30 AM until 10:30 PM, every day.  Called for lunch reservations at a friend's recommendation, then took a taxi over. Didn't wait long for our table. The Saturday we were there, the main dining room was chock full of families, locals, and those who probably taxied over. (Yes, all good eats are off Strip.) Orchids Garden is ready for crowds: they have a large parking lot and a second high-capacity dining room purposed for lunch, dinner, and banquets.  We feasted on chicken feet, delicious green peppers with shrimp, tender tripe, tasty siu mai, pork buns, flour rice sheets, and fried shrimp balls wrapped about sugar canes - my favorite of the morning. Plates were strewn about, chopsticks flew. Servers constantly came by to clear our dishes and to ask if we wanted more food which was always appreciated. Drinks-wise, we skipped alcohol and sipped chrysanthemum and jasmine tea.  The bill was reasonable, especially split amongst friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Place sucks! Uses microwave to heat old food. Eaters BEWARE! I'm going to report them to the health department. Food was stale service was really rude!!"}
{"text":"Okay ladies and gents... I am FINALLY writing a review about this place after how many times I've been here! LOL Don't believe my number of check-ins on Yelp, because I've been here a countless number of times over the years.  Dim Sum has always been one of my favorite Asian cuisines since I was little. :] I would always get excited with the steam carts that come rolling around because the food is not only ready when you say, but it's downright delicious. Can't stress that enough.  This restaurant has been around for several years now and I'm glad it still exists. Their dim sum is authentic and one of the best tasting. They may not have what you want from the steam cart all the time, but you can always order it fresh. Which is a good thing, so you know that it hasn't been sitting in the cart all day.  My absolute fave items are the shrimp noodle, shumai, hargow, beef tripe, shrimp dumplings, and shark fin dumplings. For dessert, make sure to order the sweet cream buns! So bomb. Their regular menu is good too.  I frequent this place so much, that the workers have become my friends. HAHA They know my big appetite for dim sum is real. Being a fellow Asian, I criticize every lil thing about this cuisine because I want it to taste the same every time. Now the only downfall is that some menu items are really oily, but steamed food is better than fried. Plus, dim sum portions are small so it's not the worse thing, but something to consider for those that watch for their oil and salt intakes.  The restaurant itself is not formal, but they occupy a big space. It's a whole building. lol Which is really great if you come here with a big group.  Give this place a try when your craving for dim sum is too much to handle. Let it become your go-to place when you want to order for pick-up too. It's a stand alone restaurant for a reason."}
{"text":"Only been there once but would definitely want to go back again. All day dim sum! The food was good but it being dim sum, sometimes it freshly made and some if it was probably a few hours old and cold by the time it got to us. Went there early afternoon on a Saturday I think and it was fairly empty and they didn't have as many runners and food going around so it took a while for us to get a decent amount of food on our table. I don't know when their prime hours are but it's probably better if you go sometime around there where they're expecting to have a lot of people, thus more food being prepared and it being more fresh. I'd definitely go there again.  Had two tvs but what they were airing was completely random. The big screen had a soccer game going on and there's another screen up front by the waiting area and that was airing Entertainment Tonight or something."}
{"text":"Went with extended family. Good dim sum, and I like the idea of dim sum all day. Pork and leek dumplings were delicious. Seems a little pricey compared to L.A. San Gabriel Valley, but it's good. Nice change of pace from the Strip.  Plan to go back."}
{"text":"Good time to go is only during lunch. Dim sum is hot and fresh otherwise not so good and limited items. Waitresses and manager is a bunch of grouchy people! If you understand Chinese you will know what I mean. They can't do anything else but push the cart and hand you the food. They need to learn about customer service otherwise don't expect a tip from me."}
{"text":"Fresh off a red-eye, my family and I were looking for some hearty Chinese comfort food for brunch. We decided to stop here as we drove by - a great choice! The service is snappy and the food is hot and fresh. I'd agree with some of the other reviewers in that the dim sum isn't the most lifechanging dim sum I've ever had, but for the service, quality, and ridiculous value (13 dishes for ~$40 after tax), Orchid Gardens is a fantastic choice. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The dim sum here was pretty good. The servers were fast and furious coming around with the carts too. It's solid. Good stuff and the staff was very friendly. I also ordered off of the regular menu and got Pepper Steak. It was very flavorful and a hearty portion. I was able to make 2 meals from it. I would recommend this place if you're looking for chinese or dim sum in particular."}
{"text":"My aunt decided to try this place after hearing it was really good from her friends. For me, the overall experience was kinda just OK. The place seemed a bit dated, but at least the furniture wasn't ripped or tables that were lopsided like other places I've been to. The quality of the food is like a 3 1/2 stars. There definitely are some other joints here in Vegas that have dim sum and are better overall in my opinion. High recommendations for this place maybe because they serve dim sum all day rather than just for brunch/lunch like other places?  We always get the pan fried combination noodles when coming to a dim sum place, bao (pork bun) and siomai (dumpling). Today my sister ordered the crab ball which is basically crab meat balled and fried. It was pretty good actually, and they ask if you want the mayo dipping sauce to go along with it. My advice, ask for a couple spoon scoop fills if you like mayo or creamy dipping sauces so you'll have enough for 3 of the shrimp balls. Really does do the shrimp and crab balls justice. This place wasn't outstanding, and it wasn't bad either. I guess it's what you expect at a dim sum place. I know I'll be back here if I'm in town with family again."}
{"text":"The place looks good and so as the food but probably because of pubic hair. I found 2 strands in their dimsum."}
{"text":"Dim sum served all day? Yes! Get in my belly!! This was my fist time that I've had dim sum served from the cart. I know I know that's odd especially since I've only eaten dim sum in Cali. But when I had dim sum, it was the type where you ordered what you wanted by marking it on a piece of paper. I seriously felt like a glutton. I came here with my cousin and her family and I think they were secretly making fun of me because I wanted everything! The lady would come by and I would grab everything from the cart! Hey for my first time at this place, I wanted to try it all! The list of the few items I didn't like is shorter than what I did. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but I do remember that the crab wontons and their mayonnaise sauce was to die for!"}
{"text":"There are not much dim sum places here in Vegas. One of the very few I go to is Orchids Garden.   Compared to the other dim sums I tasted, this one is not bad. They have variety of choices, the price is modest and the place is huge."}
{"text":"Good Dim Sum and a great selection of tasty entrees on there regular menu as well . It's one of the better Chinese cuisines in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Not exactly the best dim sum I have ever had, but not horrible either.  I do like that if I crave dim sum for dinner that this place serves it all day!  Also, the staff is really friendly.  When we wanted something on the menu that wasn't on the carts the waitress brought it out for us.   They were pretty efficient with service without being pushy to get you in and out."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite dim sum place. Service is good and fast. Carts keep coming!"}
{"text":"They serve the best pineapple buns in town! \"Balo Bao\" is small little baked buns with a yellow top crust. Their's is filled with a custard and are soooo yummy! The rest of the dim sum is pretty average. Expect a wait on the weekends if you come between 11:30 and 1pm.  Fun place to bring a group of 4 or more. 6 to 8 people is ideal so you can try a bunch of different things. They also do a good Chow Fun that's \"sup chow\" AKA wet.  I know that doesn't mean a lot to most.... but if you get what I'm sayin' ... it's good."}
{"text":"Not bad Not bad.. the dim sum was quite fresh and the cost was quite reasonable..  WHen people say this chinese place is dirty.. i would agree.. but its a CHINESE restaurant.. I would be quite concerned if the place was too clean.  Now I've been to some bad places.. so I know bad when i see it.. for those of you who love dim sum.. this place is a good choice.. Also you might want to plan accordingly.. i went on tuesday for lunch and it was crowded.. I can  just imagine coming here on the weekend.. And by the way this place is so popular they are open on Thanksgiving.. AND they extended their hours this day.. hmmm.."}
{"text":"The food is good and the selection is plentiful. We went during the lunch rush and the place was packed. There were several employees making sure everyone was taken care of. They have several carts going around the restaurant with numerous choices of dim sum or you can order regular dishes off the menu.   Service was fast and attentive and our entire lunch bill for two people was under $30."}
{"text":"Hot oil and soy sauce... nnnno it's not a massage spa - it's dim sum.  We have food babies... tummy bulges! I'm not gonna eat for a week!  Why do we get full so fast eating dim sum?! Whyyyyy are our eyeballs bigger than our tummiiiies?!  Uuhwwhhyyyy : (  Overall great! Got a huge family to entertain? Here is a perfect place to feed them AND clean up free. You don't needa do dishes, clear off and wipe down tables, no after feast vacuuming. Just bring your huge families here for that party :-D  Weekends are crazy busy. But even then, their carts pass by frequently enough. Tuesday night seems like a good time to grub; not packed or loud. Can't say too much about service since it's pretty easy - yes or no? How many? Okay.   But when I lived in the bay area, the only time I'd get to have dim sum was when I'd visit my sis in San Francisco. We'd walk to Chinatown from North Beach cuz she used to live near Pier 39.  NOW here in Vegas, dim sum is available everyday until 10:30pm! Huuuuh...  Don't get hooked... self control. Mind over matter. Control your impulse. Warning: may cause food coma.   I'm not gonna eat for a week!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, food was amazing (one star). The servers was okay, but as soon as we got our tab, we were being followed as if we were going to walk out without paying or something. The lady literally stood next to my niece like she was being escorted by a police officer!! I couldn't believe it!! My niece yelled at the lady and said \"can you hold on, can you not see we have infants in car seats?!!!\" The lady then replied, oh ok and walked away.   We had a party of 7 and 2 little newborns. Of course, we had to get ourself situated especially knowing we have little ones with us.   The front end had no  personality whatsoever!! They treated us the same way, didn't even apologized for what what just happened. All 3 just stared at us with no smile on their faces. After all that embarrassment, how are they going to expect you to pay and not give your receipt on return?!!! This was our first experience here and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"4 stars for dim sum in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Wow... Reading some of the negative reviews prior to writing this is a little perplexing as I encountered no such things. My standards too low? Or yours too high? Princesses, do you get treated rudely often? Do you see the common denominator there? (Cough cough.. You.) Might I suggest you mind your own tone of voice and body language when speaking to someone. Respect goes two ways. Servers are there to serve you food, not be your personal servant. There is a difference. And if you're going to use a rude tone to someone don't be so shocked when you get it back. Try being polite and courteous. It will make a world of a difference in not just the response you get from servers, but from people in general. Not sure what to make of the \"treated like crooks\" comments. Might be from the same group.. Perhaps you ever thought to yourself that they are that vigilant because they got ripped off one too many times?? And I have taste buds. Thanks for wondering. I'm also full Chinese. So I know my dim sum. Need a blood sample? how about a geneologic family tree? (Insert eye roll here).  I've been to many dim sum places in LA, SF, HI, Vancouver, and Vegas. Everywhere I travel I will find me a dim sum place to try out. On my most recent trip to Vegas I ate here twice. Found this place via Yelp. Thank you Yelp! There aren't many dim sum places in Vegas. The others I have been to are mediocre at best. Given the lack of competition Orchid Garden is the best in Vegas that I have tried.   With that said.. Neither times that I came was I presented with rude behavior. They were actually quite pleasant and helpful. The first time it was around lunch (12:00 pm) and the second late breakfast (10:00 am). Both times our food was hot, fresh, and good tasting. Lots of options for dim sum. For that matter I have never been to a place with so many selections to choose from. Hence why I had to come twice so I could try as many as my little piggy heart desired. Well seasoned. Not overcooked. I really liked the shrimp ball on sugar cane skewer. The only dish I wasn't crazy about was the daikon/radish cake. The daikon was a bit bitter, which told me it was slightly undercooked. Otherwise just about everything we tried was yummy.   From what I could see and tell this place was clean. No pieces of food stuck onto utensils. No dirty cups.  No fingers went into my water. I inspect my plate, cups, and silverware before eating everywhere I go. Bit of a germaphobe. The place is huge and just looked a little old. I would go back my next trip out to Sin City."}
{"text":"they serve dim sum all day and huge selection. this place is always packed whenever i go so the service is kind of slow. overall, this is my go to spot for dim sum."}
{"text":"\"DO YOU WANT TO TRY THE CARL?\"  Uhhh is that the only thing you have here at Orchids Garden?  After an entire weekend of debauchery, eating the greatest foods, a saturday night partying in XS, I expected so much more from a highly yelped place.  Dim Sum all day: I don't understand this concept because i cannot fathom what happens right when we leave, more dimsum will either magically appear or you will close for a couple hours and reopen again for the hung-over and hung-ry.  Like my friend Jeff C. said last night, \"Shumai was like honey i shrunk the kids\" Because it was so little i questioned if i was really eating it or it was another Las Vegas desert mirage.  I've had bad dimsum before in San Diego, but man, it feels like, this is the absolute worst I have had. Its not that it was disgusting, but the whole idea of the little carts coming around and you choosing from a plethora of dim sum options was non existent and I was left sorely disapppointed.   The only think i had here was a potential to meet some people that i apparently danced the night away with... If i could remember them.  Unlike a night of partying with some major cuties, Orchids Garden left me with the smallest figment of resonating memories.  And why does everyone who works here look strange... and not speak a lick of engrish.  And no, I do not want to try the Carl. You have offered it 8 times.  Sooty L., Did we go to the same place because the place you are describing, Jeff C. and I wish we went there instead."}
{"text":"From NYC.  I've had my fair share of both \"authentic\" Chinese (Flushing, Chinatown, etc) and my fair share of \"takeout style.\"  But what on Earth is this?  I like new things/styles, but only if done right. This wasn't.   Let's begin: Upon entry, the smell of incense is present to mask the smell of urine pouring out the messy bathroom. Service was friendly, but incessant, to the point of annoying. 4 times within five minutes being asked if I want a refill on my Coke. I didn't. I'm on a diet. But I said yes, like tipping the ugly girl at a strip club so she goes away!  Now for the food. Where is the sauce?  The pork fried rice and chicken fried rice came out white. Looked steamed, not fried. Tasted bland as anything, flavored only by what tasted like a hint of butter. My wife's meal is traditionally served with a brown sauce (hoisin). However, there was nothing on it. Everything tasted boiled (in water) or steamed. I tried several Dim Sum dishes. The continual cart system was kinda neat, but many of the plates were indistinguishable from one another. Some were just gross, mushy, bland, \"mystery meat.\"  One or two puréed shrimp dim sum dishes were decent, not too fishy (shrimp toast style).  The place had no \"dumpling sauce,\" a staple in Chinese takeout where I'm from. It's essentially warm soy, ginger, and scallions, maybe some brown sugar. They did present me with vinegar instead. On my half of the continent, the Chinese vinegars are dark in color, similar to balsamic. This vinegar was pink, tasting like something you'd use to clean your shower.   Wontons were small with the very thin wrapper, halfheartedly twisted at the end as opposed to the kind that are closer to a thick, flavorful egg noodle, folded like a fortune cookie. They skimped on the soup contents, and I'm not sure why a wonton soup for one person is considered a half an order. What is this, Carmine's?    Menu was lacking some things we all like to see. If you google \"Chinese food menu\" you will not see anything similar to what they have here, that's a takeout style menu. However, some things I like to see in authentic cuisine were missing, as in \"braised pork shoulder.\"    Ever go to a foreign country and try a McDonalds and things just aren't \"right?\"  A comparable feeling at this place.  Some pleasantries were missing: tea automatically brought to table, crispy noodles with duck sauce,etc. However, I asked for noodles for my soup and got a crispy noodle style I had never experienced. It was really tasty.   They were friendly to my child, but I'll never visit again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ALWAYS have dim sum here when we are in Vegas. Great prices. Good food. Fast cart rotation. My favorite part of dim sum is the calamari, seaweed sushi roll with delicious sweet and sour and lastly thier tiny little fruit tart cups. But the fruit tarts are only served on Sat/Sun. I was very much disappointed when I went there on a Monday for dim sum and they didnt have them."}
{"text":"The service and quality is amazing. I would come here every time for dim sum and amazing egg drop soup. Try the har gow. Chicken feet -perfect. Get some hot green tea to open up your stomach and lemonade def worth it"}
{"text":"I love this place  I've been coming here for years now and it's never a disappoint. They sirve you quickly and are just prompt with everything. I can't speak for the items on the regular menu because I'm always here for Dim Sum but it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"This review solely for take out Dim Sum. Always has been delicious.  Ate inside once and the dim sum from the carts unfortunately seemed old, not fresh at all, was a disappointment especially taking someone who was visiting. I suggest ordering them to go and eating at home!"}
{"text":"We were driving down the street the other night and saw this beautiful building with a lot of cars in the parking lot. So we stopped and grabbed a bite. The dining area is very large, I was quite surprised. They do Dim Sum all day, which is awesome. The ladies who go around to the tables know what is in each of the dishes too. That's unusual for some of the places I've been.  We ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again.   Great service, amazing sweet & sour chicken & Dim Sum all day! Plus it's 5 minutes it from my house. Gets a good review in my book!"}
{"text":"This is the only dim sum place my husband and I will go to. They have great dim sum, but not so great service. There is a lot to choose from and everything takes great! My husbands favorites are the tendons and chicken feet, lol. I love the fried shrimp wonton (not sure the real name of it) and fried rice."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Vegas dim sum house. While it can't compare to the LA palaces it's still pretty decent. Everything is fresh and quick to the table. The staff is always friendly and helpful explaining food items that we might not recognize."}
{"text":"this is my go-to place for chinese and dim sum cravings. this is close to my place of residence, so I dont have a hard time deciding to keep coming back here. the servers are nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Ugh their shrimp ball is crazily good! This place is awesome! Whenever i crave for dim sums? This is where i always go and i know i'll be spending money haha the staff walks around the whole place and show you dimsums or other food in a small plate then you choose. I always get shrimp balls, siumai, chicken feet for my mom,   Then i tried the noodles which was surprisingly good, roasted duck, and more. Food is great, it's just the service and the staff weren't as good as the food haha but worth it!"}
{"text":"I find myself coming here after getting my flex on at the gym. This place is great. I hated it whenever I missed the normal dim sum hours. All day dim sum?!? WHAT?!?   I can't complain about the different shrimp and pork dumplings that they serve. \"I'll try dat!\"  Their chile sauce has good kick to it. HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!  The two items that stood out for me was the roasted duck and tripe. The roasted duck has the perfect crispiness to it accompanied with the perfect amount of fat. Every piece was greaZy and flavorful. MMMMM MMMMM!!! The lady gave me a hint. If you end up getting two orders of the duck for dim sum, just order a half duck on the regular menu. You'll save $4. EYE LIKE!!! NAAAAAAAAS!!! HOW MUCH!!! The tripe didn't change my life like how the roasted duck did, but the slight bitterness of it had me ordering more.  Good food for sure.  I love to frequent this place. Thanks yallz for serving dim sum all day. ... These guys deserve at least 4.  HIGH LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Southern and Northern Cali and have an adventurous palate but this place landed a slot in my wall of shame.    Our waitress was rude and she couldn't be bothered so.... there goes that. A very pricey meal for food in carts. Not worth your hard earned $$$ or winnings.   Yelp should create no star choices. They don't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"CLICK HERE for FREE iPad  ABC Cancels The Bachelor  All Day Dim Sum  Justin Bieber Deported  US Men's National Team Advances to Quarterfinals of World Cup   Yes, all things that upon seeing we instantly know are too good to be true, except Orchids in Vegas actually does serve dim sum ALL DAY*  Granted, the mere act of eating dim sum during off hours doesn't make it taste any better. Orchids Garden is in the garden-variety 3 star quality level. Nevertheless, it's dim sum at night, I can't complain!  This is normally the part where I would tell you the har gow is superior to their disappointing sui mai, and that there was a lack of consistency on warmth levels on a few dishes, but like I said, I'm not gonna complain. Egg rolls were conspicuous by their absence, but the fried crab and fried wontons made up for it. The baked sweet cream bun was a pleasant surprise. A variety of BBQ pork options were available. Prices were also quite reasonable.  I assumed going in that the dinner menu would be limited and service would be minimal. But let your heart not be troubled, the carts come out at night, pass by often, drink refills are frequent, and you can order non dim sum dishes off the dinner menu.   *it's not actually ALL DAY, just all hours they're open, so not like at 4 in the morning"}
{"text":"This is Las Vegas. So I have to tone down my perception of food quality in general.  And I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the past 24 months, at different time.  It served Dim Sum all day. But as expected, the dim sums after the rush hour, i.e. at night, was awful. During lunch hours when the foods were fresh, and abundant. The variety has been standard. Nothing too surprising. Lots of fried foods for American.  The price, as in all Las Vegas, was higher for what it's worth. For 2 people the last time we ate there, it's $30 for 10 items. Egg tarts are medium price (all places I've been to charged low price). The chow mien was a bit bland. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was very tender on the stalk.  So diners, it's good to have dim sum here during busy hour. For tourists, it's Las Vegas. Get used to it."}
{"text":"We planned on Sunday morning Dim Sum with our family, headed to our \"usual\" spot, Cathay House...\"closed for repair\", said the sign in the window so we headed to the closest and best rated spot on Yelp - Orchid. It was very good, we left happy and with full bellys. The only complaint was that the room temperature was too hot for me...my other family members didn't seem to mind. I love the culture here, the loud/rambunctious waitresses, the carts zipping around, the piping hot food and the gathering of family and friends!"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is good, not bad for Sin City.  OK it's pretty good here.  Even my nephew liked it.  And he is not a dim sum kind of guy.  It's a push cart kind of restaurant. I mean you can also order from the waiters but good luck on trying to get their attention. If you don't see it in the cart you can try to get it from waiters but make sure you know the name of that dim sum.  It takes awhile for them to get to you and they are running around like crazy. But other than that it's the usual dim sum way. Wait wait wait and bam 5 carts right there.  And you're trying to scramble and order it all. We pretty much ordered the simple dumplings, noodles, the ones with shrimp in it (lol) and we also got tea which is complementary.   This location is in a plaza so parking is good.  Unless it's the weekend it gets crowded.  The wait to be seated for us that day was 5 minutes. Now that was amazing we usually wait about 30 mins or longer.  The price for this place is not bad, reasonable. But when is dim sum ever inexpensive."}
{"text":"By far the best dim sum! Always a stop when coming to LV! Love the fact dim sum is served all day! Hubby loves the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of dim sum places (SF Bay Area) and this place so far is the best I've found in LV.  I'll keep coming back until they open a better one.  Service is fast, food is hot and the food is good.  If you don't get here near opening time, it gets pretty packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food. It was a good price for what I ate. However, I came with a group and we needed to split the bill. The lady in the front gave us attitude when we told her we would like to do separate payments. Other than that, this is a good place!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here on Saturday night at around 7pm.  They didn't have the thousand year egg + pork porridge that I was hoping to eat, and what they did have was cold.  Dim sum is supposed to be piping hot...what the hell, man?  I feel like business was bad that day, and I got the left overs."}
{"text":"Meh. Okay food. Three stars because I was hugely disgusted by my water. Check then picture I added."}
{"text":"Made a trip today and they are closed. Sign said they violated a permit and have been  closed since Jan 9th."}
{"text":"Joined some friends here for lunch. I couldn't believe how busy they were so naturally I said this place has got to be good if they are this busy. Now this I'd the first Time that I have came here. What I. An say is thar it is an experience like no other. So we waited for about 45 minutes to be seated, I do suggest if you decide to go here come prepared  to wait. They do need a better way to notify customers that there table is ready instead of just yelling our your number. Now as for the food it's really good. There are carts that go around the restaurant with different types of food on them y .ok u just pick what you want and eat. I  would definitely go back again to eat because they do have good food and good dim sum."}
{"text":"I do enjoy eating here most days but some times they run out and don't make any more of that dish. So it's very hit and miss.   If you have something on your menu at least have it."}
{"text":"I wanted to explore more of the dim sum scene in Vegas, so I rounded up a few co-residents and came for a dim sum lunch. There was a mild wait for our table, but nothing too crazy.  The dim sum itself was fairly decent with a good variety of dishes. The quality was perhaps not to the level of some of the best places I've had in California, but it was great for Vegas. Prices were typical I would say.  Service was adequate, dim sum servers are usually fairly no-nonsense. The interior was large and looked like a standard Cantonese restaurant.  Solid dim sum place for sure."}
{"text":"I always have to try to eat here when i go visit vegas. Their dimsum is served until dinner.   They have a big restaurant that can accomodate big crowds. They get really busy for lunch.  They also have a big parking lot and service is usually good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly quick service and short wait time for a table of 12 even at 1pm on a Sunday.  Lots of variety of dim sum to choose from.  Good thing food is right in front of you and ready to eat because I was HUNGRY.  The ladies that work the carts of food around the restaurant are friendly and helpful, even though they are persistent in trying to get you to buy more.  I usually eat dim sum in Westminster at Seafood Cove (previously Dragon Phoenix).  This place's dim sum was better, in my opinion.  Not as salty and leaving you parched for lots of water as Seafood Cove.  All in all, a great place to eat with family while in Vegas.  We order a lot of dishes and were completely stuffed. The bill was $160 before tax and tip."}
{"text":"My girl wanted dim sum and I always drove past this place. The atmosphere was nice and mellow and the waiter was friendly. This is more of a cultural experience. Everybody has tried Chinese food, however having carts making rounds with different selection of food is another level."}
{"text":"We came at 8:30 pm when closing time said 10:30 pm the turned away saying that they were closed after a 20 miles drive"}
{"text":"A MUST READ -- It's like the all day breakfast at McDonald's !   First time trying this out. I'm usually a dim sum morning kinda guy. Don't mind the fact all the servers can speak English, how cool was that. Super oriental Chinese ambience!  Today I order mostly shrimp dish today, nonetheless everything superb 10/10 for food and service.   If you ever feeling dim-summy anytime of the day definitely check this out. Now I prefer to dim sum at 6pm."}
{"text":"The parking lot was full at this dim sum restaurant.  I was quite surprised that there were so many people here for lunch on a regular weekday.  Which means their dim sum must be good, right?  This was my 2ndt time here.  First time was almost 8 years ago.  We ordered the regular dim sum fare and although their dim sum weren't as good as the ones out in Los Angeles, it wasn't bad.  The carts came around quite often and the food was fresh and hot.  They also had quite a large selection of dim sum items.  Their shrimp dumpling was a little on the small side.  Although their small dim sum are only $2.10, they have quite a few items that cost more than that. So, when all is said and done, the two of us spent over $30 for dim sum.  The next time I have the urge for dim sum, I will definitely come back and try some of their other dim sum items."}
{"text":"This place is garbage! The dim sum is cold and the taro taste like ammonia. Stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I come from the San Gabriel Valley... so of course my standards for dim sum is a lot higher than the average Joe. With that said, this restaurant's food was terrible. I could tell that some of the food was the microwaveable kind and none of it tasted flavorful or fresh. The skin of the Har Gow and Shau Mai was practically melting and falling apart. The white rice cake dessert that I love love love, was also falling apart. It all tasted overly cooked/steamed and had no flavor. I guess if you are in Vegas and want dim sum, then this is a good option for you. As for me, I do not plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Good service. Very nice server! My friend recommend to come and first time we've been here super fast!"}
{"text":"I eat my brains out every time with no regrets.   Their chili oil rocks my world. All their food is pretty good too. My favorite would have to be the fried crab and shrimp balls.  The service is alright. To be honest, it's kind of slow.  Every time I come here, I expect good food and average service but the food makes it worth the trip. There's no beating their all day dim sum."}
{"text":"I'm from California and there's a million dim sum places there and compared to that this place isn't bad! I was really surprised how tasty everything was AND the servers were nice. They weren't yelling at you to hurry up and pick from the cart.   It was pretty dead when I went on a Sunday afternoon but they still provided majority of the items on the menu. If you wanted something that you didn't see they would ask the cook in the bad to make it fresh."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of dim sum.  The food here was great but the portions was a little small.  I am so use to the portions in the Bolsa area.  The dim sum was comparable to the food at the Seafood Palace in Westminster.  I recommend this place in Las Vegas for dim sum.  Again the portion was small but the quality is there.  I give this place a solid 4 Stars.  Good stuff !!! The coconut buns was so good.  The bread is soft and airy.  So hard to describe but so gooooood."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas numerous times and never found this place. Dim Sum here is awesome. I recommend this place to anyone who come to Vegas and like Dim Sum to come here."}
{"text":"Not great not bad.  We had cashew chicken..very salty otherwise ok.  Chanel veggies in it thougg.  Also veggie fried rice not bad but $9 for side of rice bit pricy.  We'd go back but wouldn't go out of our way."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I called in a pick up order about 30 minutes before they closed and they were very helpful, making suggestions and answering questions about menu items. Order was ready when I arrived, was still hot and everything tasted great. The shrimp chive dumpling was particularly delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves dimsum all day! My first time here. The place is huge and looks spacious for events like wedding parties or any kind of parties.  My parents, my boyfriend and I came here this afternoon for lunch and were seated imediately, the place was busy which is good news. We had fried Sesame balls, baked egg tart, sweet tofu, steamed chibese brocolli, jellyfish,roast duck, xo soy sauce pan fried noodle, etc.  I like the turnip cake that is made with shredded daikon radish and mixed with rice flour and flavored with ham, sausage, shrimp, or other vegetables before being pressed into cakes just melts in your mouth.  And the rice balls-stretchy, chewy texture like Japanese mochi which is essentially identical.They get coated with sesame seeds and deep-fried until they are puffed up and are then piped with a sweet red bean paste.  The baked bbq pork bun was wow my boyfriend says and everything else were delicious.   I noticed the price were cheaper than other dim sum place in town.  The cart was rolling around quick and the service was ok.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a going away lunch for the intern there.  Even though it was fairly busy our party of 6 was sat quickly, drink orders were taken, and carts started coming around.  We had a great variety available which we all enjoyed and were out of there in an hour.    This is some place I want to come back to and bring friends."}
{"text":"I was craving dim sum as we drove back from Zion and passing through Las Vegas, so I turned to Yelp. We arrived before it opened so we decided to explore by driving The Strip. This place opens at 10:30AM and has a big parking lot. It got crowded as we dined.  They have your usual hai gow, siu mai, chicken feet, etc. The food was pretty good and so was the service. It was spacious and comfortable. The price was sort of pricy as it was $50 for the 4 of us. But I guess it really depends what you order and how much. I would come back though."}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend on Valentine's Day and we were seated immediately. We were there before dinner time and awhile after we got in, the restaurant started getting pretty busy. The service was decent and not very memorable, but I'm giving it 5 stars because of the food. The Steamed Pork Shiu Mai was one of the best that I've ever had. It was so flavorful and tasted fresh, unlike other Dim Sum places *Ahem, East Ocean*. I am also a huge fan of their Shrimp Har Gow as well as their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun.   We got other food items as well, but those three are the ones that I am most critical about and Orchids Garden passed with flying colors!  Near the end of our meal, the servers came out and gave the ladies who were dining single roses. I thought that this was such a nice touch!"}
{"text":"A nice, simple Chinese restaurant to visit when in Vegas. A bit off the strip but great for large parties and spacious tables especially for children.    I really come here for their variety of dim sum.  Several ladies push around carts of steaming dumplings to small plates of vegetables and shumai to name a few. My favorites are the har gow, steamed greens and shrimp pops. There is also desserts available distinguished with sweet glazes and sweet sticky rice cakes.   My preferences are very simple...house pan fried noodles loaded with bok choy, mushrooms, greens and chicken, salty pork chops that compliment either steamed white rice or combination fried rice and pretty much any steamed vegetable.  So yummy you won't even feel like you over did it as expected when eating Chinese food.  The complementary oolong tea is a nice drink during the meal as well as a great finisher.   Also, their Thai iced tea is large, tall and flavorful not watered down with too much ice. It goes great with just about everything they serve.   One thing is for sure, the prices are reasonable and it's big enough to accomadate a large head count.  Huge parking lot at the front and can get really crowded on the weekends during brunch.  Plan to arrive early to beat the wait list."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dim sum place in Las Vegas! I've been going for years, and I can't get enough of it. I have to eat here every time I'm in Vegas. It's a MUST for me and I think it should be a MUST for you too! I highly recommend it (if you couldn't tell already by my excited Yelp review)!   Here are my favorites dishes (and I order multiple of each when I go):   -Pork Shumai -Shrimp Noodle -Shrimp Har Gow  -Green Peppers with Shrimp -Pork Spare Ribs -Beef Spare Ribs -Fried Shrimp Balls  And for dessert, I go for either the Fried Red Bean Sesame Seed Balls or the Sweet Tofu! It depends on what mood I'm in, but both are delicious!  I'm drooling just thinking about all the food from Orchid Gardens! Anyways, I'm a HUGE fan! 5 STARS for Orchid Gardens!"}
{"text":"We come here for Dim Sum when in Vegas...  It's good, affordable and well... Nothing mind blowing...  Good enough, friendly enough... Not much else to say about this place... Typical Dim Sum hall"}
{"text":"It was quick and easy! Food was great and they came around quite a bit with their carts. I just wish it was closer to the strip."}
{"text":"Was craving dim sum, and came here based on reviews. Came on a Saturday afternoon around 2 and there was no wait. The dim sum was only ok. The har gow and shu mai at Bacchanal was better. I havent really tried any other dim sum places in las vegas, nor have I found any good reviews on any."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(164/365) \"Dim Sum All Day\"  Long overdue update and upgrade!  Wifey and I joined Amelinda and Ruben for a Sunday Dim Sum Brunch. It was PACKED when we arrived, but luckily they were already seated. We dined family style grabbing our favorites like siu mai,  rice cakes, shrimp wontons, chicken feet and har gow. This was also our first time trying the Turnip Cakes and Chicken Roll.  Regardless of how busy they were, service was quick, efficient, and great. Every item we ordered was hot, and had its own distinct flavors. Still one of my favorite spots to get my dim sum fix.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"Finally open again. Excellent food and service. Don't believe the stories that they are closed forever - they're not. Open and delicious."}
{"text":"Dim Sum served all day?!? Yes please!!! If only other dim sum locations did this, I would be in heaven! Since I sure do love my Asian food, and sometimes wish I can have dim sum later on in the day. Been to Orchids on two occasions, one was for a wedding at night with typical Chinese banquet wedding food, and the other was for a dim sum breakfast. Service was decent, the wedding food was average, but the dim sum was slightly above average. Four stars because it's served all day."}
{"text":"Standard dim sum ALL done well.  Cart service was ok, some smiles occasionally, some no looks.  Bus service was on the ball, empties removed, water refills timely, vinegar as requested, boxes come with bags without request.  Best part was the C tea with rock sugar.  Will be back next time we're in town.  Where else can you get dim sum from 10:30am to 10:30pm?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times to Orchids, and out of PPP, Changs Cathay House and KJ, I've probably enjoyed their wu gok/fried taro dumplings the best. They have all the usual dim sum items here -- but that fried taro dumpling is basically my litmus test for a good dim sum spot. At Orchids their dumpling was warm with a good ratio of filling-to-dough ratio, it wasn't too greasy or had that soaked up that nasty oil flavor from incorrect frying temperature, and still had that lovely crunch and flakiness on its outer layer.   Nothing to write home to mama about, its solid/on par for Vegas dim sum standards, 3.5 stars rounding up. It might be out of my way but it's still worth the drive when me and my guest(s) need to eat our way through a hangover in the morning. Like any other decent dim spot arrive early or expect to be waiting a while on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went for Dimsum lunch. Loved it. Lots of variety to choose. Must try. Away from strip. But worth the drive. Prices are descent not priced like the strip."}
{"text":"Here has the worst customer service EVER!! Now their dim sum finally getting better, but they still need improvement on their customer service ! Way to go ORCHIDS"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE! My boyfriend and I dropped in based upon the yelp reviews. The place was packed which was a good sign to us! We thought we had a really legit place! Ok, NO! First off, the customer service is very poor, most people here barely speak English and are rude.. We soon felt out of place by the way we were treated. Ok, fast forward to the food.. The dim sum cart rolled around so we decided on the meatballs.. They looked good.. Key word here LOOKED. We each took a bite of a gelatin type meatball... It sill gives me the chills thinking about it. I couldn't tell you what kind of meat it was and I don't care to ever find out. Truly disgusting!"}
{"text":"The ratio of customers to waitress/dim sum carter-ers was too little. I kept looking around for the next cart and only til the last cart did I get the shrimp har gao that I was craving.  Their noodles were greasy and DELICIOUS =) Just what I wanted!  And it's not as good (quality of food and quickness of carts) as Chang's but, not hating. I was craving dim sum and I got it at 9pm on Christmas Day! It did what it needed to do: satisfy me!"}
{"text":"Great, fast Dim Sum!  We got here at about 6:00 on a Sunday and I was a little concerned that they would be out of some of my favorites but they had everything. It was all really fresh and delicious!  The cart ladies were really friendly and helpful and came around many times.   We had: Steamed BBQ pork bun Deep fried meat ball Steamed pork shiu Mai Shrimp pasted bell pepper Chow mein Calamari Baked sweet cream bun  My favorites were the BBQ pork bun, shui mai and the cream bun but really everything was amazing.   Our total with hot tea and water to drink was $ 28!  A deal for two people to eat until we almost burst. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This dim sum place is cool and that food is alright. However, if your car is lowered like mine, just a heads up the parking lot structure isn't lowered car friendly. The food here is mostly seafood, so if you aren't a big fan of seafood then i would definately not recommend this place. The dim sum is probably one of the better food that they offer. And i noticed the dim sum carts were unattended most of the time i was there. The service is standard and it would be great if you speak Chinese. Otherwise, i sure hope you have your ways of getting their attention."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Dim Sum restaurant.  The servers push carts around and you make your selections. Usually 3-4 pieces per plate. You pay by the plate ordered and they stamp your check as you order items. Be sure to order hot tea. This is excellent for a group on a large table"}
{"text":"Dim sum all day. Great food. Great service.  Easy to get seated even when it's busy. Food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Not as awesome or delicious as other reviews described....very basic variety of dimsums...not too many choices...very disappointed with the tofu dessert...used plain table top white sugar to make the syrup...should be brown sugar cane sugar...dimsum was warm..not piping hot...fried items very greasy and taste like refried....the beef tripe has no traditional chinese 5spice season.. taste like plain soysauce..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and it is so good. I love this place and trying all of the delicious foods that come around. Their shrimp dumplings are something magical, I can't get enough of them. The steam buns are perfectly chewy and sweet and the meat inside is flavorful. The service was on point, almost too on point... They are always there to swap your empty plates with steaming, hot goodness in no time making for a very filling experience. I can't wait to bring more people here."}
{"text":"At first I didn't understand how was I able to get my food but a kind lady explained to me. The lady that was our waitress seemed like she had a bit of an attitude with me. I mean the service was ok but I just didn't like how she was having an attitude with me so I had another waitress help me put my food away and I tried to give her a tip but she told me just leave it on the bill which I did but the rude lady took the bill and saw how much it was which was $3 tip for her lol.   The food overall was satisfying and very delishes. I loved the dim sum so much especially when it just came out hot and fresh! Now my dad is realising he likes Chinese broccoli and likes the oyster sauce. But I'll be coming back and hopefully the service is better."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd I have gone to Dim Sum at Orchids, and today, I was inspired to write a review. I love Dim Sum and I especially like Orchids Garden because the food is amazing, and very authentic, and being only 25% Asian I don't get dirty stares being a 6' white girl. The staff is very friendly even though some of the cart ladies don't have the best English we communicate very well. We went to Dim Sum today at about 12:30 and the place was packed (to me that is a good sign, do you really want to go to a restaurant that is empty? Doesn't that say something about their food?) We were a party of two so we didn't have to wait long. Normally I don't like sitting so close to the Kitchen but today I didn't mind, we got first picks of the fresh stuff right out of the kitchen! Not that any of the food would be cold or old, there were way too many people for that. All in all this was my best Dim Sum visit ever and I can't wait to go back, I might have to make it an after paycheck day tradition."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice now & found that it fills up around lunch time on the weekends.  I like that it serves dim sum all day & why not?  This is Vegas after all so why follow conventional rules?  Overall, I've had better dim sum in the San Gabriel Valley but this place is cheap & really, it isn't bad."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Below average dimsum + Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Frozen, not fresh. Decent place to fill your dimsum craving, but you'll find better places around for a similar value.  So subpar. Dimsum of this quality would never fly in the Bay Area.  Today was surprisingly busy, but the wait wasn't long. 20 minutes for a table of 5 to be seated.  We ordered the basic dimsum - xiu mai, hargao, and shrimp noodle rolls. The xiu mai was a bit smaller than I was used to back in the Bay, but that didn't bother me much. Flavor was there; not impressive, but also didn't disappoint. But it didn't taste fresh...it looked frozen.  Hargao was also a little bit smaller than what I was used to. Flavor was actually subpar, as I tasted nothing. Also looked frozen, not fresh.  Shrimp noodle rolls were a huge disappointment. No flavor in the rolls, despite it being soaked in the soy sauce. Why is that? It's because the SHRIMP was so damn small! This is a sure sign that food in the kitchen is frozen, not fresh.  We also ordered other dimsum dishes, such as shrimp with eggplant, chicken feet, fried crab balls, fried meat balls, and steamed buns. In addition, hot and sour soup and honey walnut shrimp was ordered.  The shrimp with eggplant was actually decent. There was some flavor in the shrimp, but the eggplant elevated the dish just a little more.  Chicken feet was also decent. The sauce it was tossed / coated in was flavorful, but chicken was average; a bit dry and looked overcooked.  Fried crab balls had a lot of flavor in them, and the crab claw embedded in the ball elevated the presentation.  Fried meat balls were average - 95% batter and 5% actual meat filling. I wouldn't suggest getting this st any dimsum place ANYWHERE, as it is just too greasy and lacks a bunch of flavor.  The steamed bun I ordered was actually a Chinese sausage bun. Some flavor was present, but the sausage itself was so dry that it shouldn't be considered a sausage anymore. It's jerky.  The hot and sour soup was your standard hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant. Packed spice for sure, but flavor itself was average.  The honey walnut shrimp came to me as a pleasant surprise to me. Each puny shrimp was battered, deep-fried, then tossed in a bath of mayo. This is VERY different from honey walnut shrimp I'm used to in the Bay (large shrimp tossed in a lighter bath of mayo, and thank god it's not battered and deep-fried). Flavor was very much absent due to the batter, but mayo made up for some of what was missing. Walnuts were average, with a standard crunch.  Chinese broccoli with XO sauce was subpar. Completely soaked in sesame oil, which meant I missed out on the freshness of the vegetables. I didn't have any sauce, so I can't speak much on that.   Service, for a lack of a better word, was slow and from what I observed, actually crappy. Rude hostess at the front killed the vibe I had for this restaurant. $110 for 5 people, from what we ordered, so it's not AS economically-friendly, but it's a better value than the places on the Strip."}
{"text":"This place is probably the worse Chinese food I've ever had. The menu smelled and I should have walked out at that point but I stayed because I was starving after a 4hr drive. I figured I should play it safe since I've never been there before and ordered a shrimp fried rice and some green beans. The rice was absolutely disgusting. No taste what so ever. No salt, no flavor at all. The green beans were ok. The waitress seemed surprised that we barely ate and we didn't want to take our left overs. The next day I went to a hair salon and they all agreed that this place has terrible food. Honestly next time I'll take my chances and opt for gas station food if I have to. This place was the worse. Do not eat here!!"}
{"text":"4-19-2016  Dim Sum was excellent.   Service was excellent. Place was clean and had a very nice decor and seating was not crowded.   Prices were reasonable ( 3 of us ate and the bill was $75) and we tried many dishes and left full.  Some of the best Crab and Shrimp I've eaten. I really liked this place and plan on returning soon.   It's located  on the Southeast corner of Sahara and Lindell.  Big enough to handle large crowds but you still get personalized attention."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let you know that the food was awesome service was very good the manager was very good person. We did enjoy very much for Father's Day with the whole family. I do recommend that place to anyone that like Chinese food!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me get this straight. A Chinese buffet where they bring the food to you? Yes please!   This was a great place to try Dim Sum (my first time). We went at a weird time (2pm) so it was basically just us in the restaurant. We were bombarded by servers with carts of food, which was cool in general. I tried  a ton of stuff. The Chinese Broccoli was amazing. They put a tasty sauce on it. The shrimp dishes we tried were all great, and I really liked the dumplings. The service was also very friendly, and they were nice to explain what each dish was, for the most part.    For a nice experience with Dim Sum off the Strip, give this place a try. Really, try it. Not just saying that. :)"}
{"text":"Our go to spot for all day dim sum. Great for large parties. It's not fine dining, but it's quick and the food is always good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to dim sum spot in town. They have carts going around the restaurant all day. Lots of other dim sum restaurants usually only have carts at lunch then switch to a menu of entrees plus some select dim sum items at dinner. I appreciate that Orchids ALWAYS has carts going, especially when you have a dim sum dinner craving. I probably first came here around eight years ago, but I eat here every other month or so and they're very consistent. Dim sum here is good, affordable, and convenient. You could manage a quick lunch here if you work nearby. Service is typically great when I come here and the hostess is always nice.   Lots of parking available right outside the restaurant. Also kind of random, but as a huge Final Fantasy fan I have to mention that they sometimes play orchestral versions of classic FF soundtracks from the games. I love it, but couldn't help laughing when I recognized the music for the first time."}
{"text":"Where did the shumai go?!?! It shrank at Orchids, that's for sure. I don't know if its fair to compare this place to any Dim Sum spots that I've been to in a Chinatown in SF or LA. But I've tasted better, and I will. Honestly, the Dim Sum wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I walked in and it definitely looked and smelled like the usual Chinese restaurant but the food definitely didn't taste like one. The breaded shrimp balls were of usual size but it came with only two pieces. I don't think I've ever been to a Dim Sum spot where they only serve you two pieces of anything, its usually 4. This has to be bad Feng Shui. Like I brought up earlier, they were also serving the smallest shumai that I've EVER seen. The pork buns were delicious due to the fluffy white bread with glaze on top, but there was hardly any pork, they should just call it BUN! I know we are in a recession, but geez, don't make it so obvious!   Its a bit far from the strip and the prices are decent. With the size of their dishes it better be affordable. This is the only Dim Sum place that I've tried in LV and I know all the other ones are a bit more pricey, so this may be a good spot for locals but not if you've been to any Chinatown before. I would only comeback if friends decide to comeback, otherwise I would pass.  The only positive is that we were able to sit 24 people instantly. Which is A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"Very rude service from the hostess to the servers. The lead service supervisor was so rude from the moment we entered the restaurant. We finally got her smile when she handed our check but still was very abrasive."}
{"text":"First Time I ever tried dim sum. It was very interesting. The crab claws were amazing. It was the first experience for me eating Oriental food and now because of them I will probably try to again"}
{"text":"Always satisfied when I go here, maybe cause I been here so many times and they know everything I want to get.  Service is quick and yes ladies are aggressive with the carts but its fun trying to say yes and no to them since we cant understand each other."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  LOVED our dim sum. It was better than Ping Pang Pong, where I normally go for dim sum in LV, and it was conveniently closer to my friends' houses and the west side.  Major plus-we didn't have to go through a casino :)  They also had a much larger variety than Ping Pang Pong.  I liked the decor and service was good.  The one minus was the parking-parking is TOUGH, especially at lunch.  WE had to hunt quite a bit for parking!  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Good ol' classic dim sum dishes, I've been going here ever since I moved to Vegas. Hot chrysanthemum tea and sugar will help you wash down all that oil. The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars was because of my recent experience. This lady came by, interrupted our discussion and had the damn nerve to ask us \"Can you pay for the bill now?\" I'm sorry but you don't decide nonetheless demand people to pay when they're obviously not ready to leave. Then she snatched the credit card from my friend's hand. Excuse me!? She acted like we were about to dine and dash or something. Rude af, she's lucky I didn't go off on her."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum here are bad. Everything was salty and bland. Need I say more? Vegas really needs a good Dim Sum place."}
{"text":"Dim sum available all day is their ad which makes me somewhat apprehensive on such a claim.  I didn't try going there in the evening for their dim sum, but during lunch hours.  Pay attention as you walk in, look for their day's specials.  There were two boards listing different specials.  One of the offered steamed or crispy flounder USD 20.95, which caught my attention for a steamed flounder.  Order this first from a waitress, as it takes maybe twenty minutes before it arrives.  Meantime, select dim sum plates as the rolling carts roll by, select one or two at time, finish those before adding more, else it's real easy to order more than you may comfortably eat.  Tea is complimentary here and is decent quality tea without a head charge for tea per person as some dim sum houses do.  Advise to not select starchy dishes (I.e. buns, noodles) as that tends to fill you, leaving less room for more dim sum plates.  Grab the dim sum prior to sitting at at table if you're concerned with their dim sum pricing which are broken down six groups, getting the dim sum menu demystifies this.  The steamed flounder turned out delicious.  Don't be shy about defining the whole flounder.  It's easy, or ask the waitress to define it for you.  Use the large tablespoon, insert into either the head or tail so bottom of the spoon comes in contact with the top of the fish bone structure and the top of the spoon contacts the bottom of the fish flesh, separating the flesh from the bone structure, carefully sliding the spoon from one end of the fish to the other end.  Save the sauce served on the fish, take it home in a sealed container for liquids or come with a quart sized sealable plastic baggie.  It goes well poured over steamed rice, much better than soy sauce, in my humbled opinion.  Dim sum personal favorites:  pan fried daikon cake A USD 2.25; steamed pork spareribs B USD 3; pan fried chive dumpling B USD 3; bean curd skin sheet roll B USD 3; baked egg tart B USD 3; pork siu mai B USD 3; shrimp har gow (has a nice thin translucent skin) B USD 3; shrimp paste in bell pepper B USD 3; shark fin dumpling B USD 3; sticky rice in lotus leaf C USD 4.1; deep fried taro C USD 4.1; salt and pepper calamari E USD 6.1.  Items that I wouldn't recommend here:  mango pudding B USD 3 tasted totally artificial with a gelatin consultancy and request milk added.  I've tasted better elsewhere.  Roast duck, didn't try try it, looked not very good.  Prices may change, credit cards accepted.  We saw custard tarts rolled by multiple times, but by the time I decided to order a plate, they were finished for the day on that dish which was around 1430 hours.  So if they out of that one dish, what else would they be out of by the time they close at 2230 hours?  If you want dim sum, come by 1330 hours at the latest."}
{"text":"My go to dim sum place in Vegas! Affordable & satisfying. I always order dim sum here, chicken feet, spare ribs, egg tarts.. You name it! This place has everything I normally like to order over and over again at any dim sum places & it's good and inexpensive. I also enjoy their chili sauce. It's open late for dim sum too which is a plus."}
{"text":"A delicious place to try dim sum for the first time! As it was my first time trying dim sum (and most of the food on the menu) I can't comment to how it stacks up to other dim sum restaurants in Las Vegas.   What I do know was that the food was delicious. I really didn't try anything that I didn't like (which is a great compliment from a super picky eater)! The food was all still hot when it was served to us, and the service from our waitress and the ladies piloting those yummy food carts around was great. A few times there were things that people in our party wanted that they didn't see on the cart, so they were brought out to us very quickly. If you don't see something you want on the carts, ask!   While I can't speak from extensive dim-sum-eating-experience, I do know that the food was good, and we had a great time at this restaurant (especially for the price). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bad service  Even worse food No food options; the same 4 carts came around..  Overall terrible experience.  I'll stick with Ping Pang Pong."}
{"text":"Women going around with carts of food with the intent to order the food from them even at the cost of not understanding them very well. The price for the dim sum is cheap and it's pretty much any other dim sums minus the carts going around. I do have to say the shrimp balls are really good. I think I would order 2-3 plates cause its so good, my favorite from this restaurant. Prepare your Chinese translation...or just say \"yes\" \"no\". And yes little far from the strip."}
{"text":"The best dim sum in town.  We have been multiple times. The variety is great.  Some items have to be special ordered and take a good twenty minutes  to prepare.  Ask to order anything you don't see to avoid the wait.  The chive dumpings, shrimp rolls and crab claw rolls are the best!!"}
{"text":"Unless you speak Chinese then you need to skip this place because they definitely don't speak fluent English at this restaurant.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of illegal aliens are working there.  A group of us decided to go here for a dim sum lunch.  The women walking around with the carts of food don't speak English and they definitely don't smile.  We could not decipher from the menu what was what from looking at the cart.  Eventually, we had to ask the Manager to come over, who also spoke very poor English, and walk us through the menu and the items on the cart.  Unless you sat near or in the aisles it was difficult for you see the food choices.  The food was unmemorable.  Dim Sum is traditionally affordable but I found out very quickly that 4 small items added up to $18.00.    Not one staff member was gracious or made us feel welcome & therefore I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wtf! U would think a restaurant like this ... or any damn restaurant would be prepared for Father's Day lunch & dinner. Well not this place. Sucks cuz I come here all the time & trust me I don't come here for good service cause that's what this place is definitely lacking. Food is good but service never impresses. Well tonight the restaurant was literally filling up & we had been sitting for over 20 min with no food. There was no dim sum cart to be found. They sent out carts with things like 8 dollar crab balls that nobody wanted & Chinese broccoli. The hell ?! After 25 min & a semi full restaurant they sent out 1 cart! That cart barely had anything on it! So 30 min pass by & we're beyond irritated because we got brushed off by the rude server when we asked about how long before they start serving food. So we ate the 3 little items we managed to get with hella chili oil & rice & left there pissed & still hungry. Ugh!"}
{"text":"we've been to vegas three or four times in the past year and this is the only restaurant we've gone back too every time. we love this place. dim sum is good and there's a good selection to choose from. we laugh every time because our table is full of food before we put our napkins in our lap. we always leave FULL and happy."}
{"text":"Love their dim sum!  And it's all day which is a rare find, anywhere..  Their shrimp in rice noodle is the best, but they didn't have it the last time I went in, which is why they don't get five stars..  Oh, and the customer service was great, the lady even gave us calendars to take home.."}
{"text":"The service was great and so was the prices. Food lacked flavor and everything from the carts was mostly cold. Really expected a lot more! Off the Dim Sum cart we tried deep fried meat dumpling, steamed BBQ pork buns, pork Shiu Mai, coconut bun, and Chiu-Chow style dumplings. Thought maybe it was just the Dim Sum that wasn't that great, so decided to try a few dishes from the regular menu. The regular menu was a bit better. Tried the Moo Shu pork, Kung Pao beef with peanuts, and the dried scallop with egg whites fried rice. The regular menu is huge with many dishes to choose from. Very busy and popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Now that we moved to the west coast & I've had the chance to try dimsum in many more restaurants, I now realize orchids has one of the best dimsum I've tried. Everything I have tried here has great texture & all flavorful. The exterior of all the dimsum I have tried here are all delicate & thin as I prefer. Soft & chewy in the inside too. Other dimsum I have tried has been tough & chewy. And really missing the flavor orchids has.    As for service, now yes it's not the greatest. But I honestly have not been to many dimsum places w/ amazing service. It's decent here. Depending on who you get. Hence the 4 stars. Otherwise I would rate this place an easy 5 just for their dimsum."}
{"text":"Really good dimsum,fair price too. The servers are a challenge to understand tho, but if u don't mind that it's a really good place to eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. We wanted to go to Cathayhouse but it's closed down again so we found this on yelp and it wasn't bad. It did have all of the usual dim sum dishes that you'd expect but maybe not the biggest selection I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Food is great . SERVICE is bad. Came to eat here and enjoyed every part of the food . When walking out with the tab to the register as to holding my newborn that just started crying. As I was waiting for my brother to come and get my son and put him in the car so I can pay . One of the workers literally snatches the bill from my 8 year old sisters hand and held the bill . As to thinking we were gonna walk out without paying . Are you serious. Why ? In the hell would we walk out without paying especially when we have 2 little ones and one pregnant family member .That lady should be fired for even judging us with a taught of walking out. RIDICULOUS   NEVER AGAIN!   Never again."}
{"text":"This was and still maybe one of my favorite places to have dim sum in Las Vegas. The portion sizes have steadily gotten smaller over the years. Still pretty good though for the most part my kids love it good for kids. This place can be busy and you need to wait sometimes if you come on a weekend especially during Prime brunch and lunch times"}
{"text":"Food isn't great. Wait for the  steam cart takes forever. Server doesn't clear table until ask and they give you that ugly look. I came here because Cathay restaurant is closed for renovation."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for breakfast for the first time and didn't have to wait long for a table.  The dim sum was good.  My favorite was the coconut buns.  It was delicious!  The services were fast and friendly.   They stopped by with different foods every few minutes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum place. Good food. Customer service is usually good. I would have given this place 5 stars except  today when I went it seemed like 2 waitresses were fighting...they were yelling across the restaurant in Chinese. Disrupted the atmosphere. Other than that, I usually enjoy going there. Dim sum is served all day plus you can order off the menu. Good variety & prices are not expensive. Very causal place."}
{"text":"Dim sum & food low quality and not too cheap !  I go another place pay a little more but have good food. I will not go there anymore!"}
{"text":"Decent quality dim sum with above average selection.  Not bad for the middle of the desert.  A touch on the pricey side.  They boast they have \"all day\" dim sum, but the selection dramactically decreases after 3 pm."}
{"text":"\"The\" worst place in town for Chinese food!  Where do I begin, the orange chicken was burnt and had some weird sauce on it, sent it back with their attitude, ordered safe and ordered chicken noodles (lo mein) when it arrived it literally had 5 small pieces of chicken in it and it was poor quality chicken with a blubber like texture. I did not eat it, nor did I get a to go box. My husband ordered the deep fried flounder and it came swimming in grease. $40 later and a bad case of indigestion, I downloaded this ap, never have given a review before but I did because Las Vegas needs to know and I don't want you to waste your time and money, go to Ping Pang Pong...much better choice!"}
{"text":"I'd say even better than Cathay House and they are pretty good. Great variety of dim sum, good service, great hot and iced tea. Lots of Asians eat here, so you know it's good."}
{"text":"I am going to give this dim sum place 5 stars.  1. For having everything I'm looking for when I go to a dim sum restaurant 2. For not having to wait an hour or two for dim sum.  I have NEVER waited to be seated at this joint. 3. For impeccable service.  Nice waiting service.  They're fast, they don't force you to buy, and they come to you immediately if you call for them. 4. All the food is good and still warm.  I can't say its the best dim sum tasting food I have but it does the job, and some of the dim sum is really good. 5. I give this place 5 stars...because of their baked egg custard buns.  They're so yummy!  On top of my five reasons, they have a wider variety than I've seen.  Not sure if they have the porridge I want though.  Have to go back and check.  Try the baked egg custard buns.  They're to die for.  My cousin and I share like 7 plates of these.  =D!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing dim sum in carts and I LOVED IT! The food tasted good and it was fun waiting for the carts to come around. I recommend eating here as soon as it opens as it gets really busy."}
{"text":"For good dim sum in Las Vegas, you probably won't find a much better place than Orchids Garden.  Because of their all day dim sum dining, the place is steadily busy!  We finally decided to try Orchids Garden because we kept hearing about it.  There are a ton of places on Spring Mountain that cater to the dim sum crowd but Orchids Garden off of Sahara kept coming up.  Off to dim sum we go!  The lady and I went on a Saturday for lunch time and it was no joke, the restaurant was full!  There were people shouting and whistling as carts full of wonderful dim sum were whizzing around the dining area.  There was steam and foul-sounding  Chinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice to see the hustle and bustle.  Gotta get your dim sum order in before the cart runs out and you have to wait!  After being seated we were given a regular restaurant menu and the dim sum menu.  It was a nice touch, prices were given in categories, and pictures were used for the various dim sum to make it easier for patrons who are not familiar with the art of dumplings.  I've watched dim sum making before, and damn, it truly is an art because you gotta be patient and be able to put out quality dim sum in almost no time flat.  Oh my aching hands!  Orchids Garden dim sum is fairly priced.  Still a bit more than dim sum from places like Cali, but not bad for Vegas standards.  All dim sum dishes range from around $2 - $6 area, and there is something for just about everyone.  Me?  I love sticking to the cheap, cheap, cheap end of the dim sum spectrum.  I think all dim sum should be cheap!  It's supposed to be akin to street food!  Who the heck wants to pay $6 for friggin' Chinese broccoli?  I don't.  Some of our faves:  -Steamed chicken feet (love it) -Steamed BBQ pork bun -Pan fried daikon cake -Baked BBQ pork bun (yummy) -Shrimp har gow -Pan fried chives dumpling (chive-y) -Beef in rice noodle -Mushroom shiu mai  The chicken feet here are fantastic!  Sticky, fatty, and delicious with a bowl of hot white rice.  We employ multiple orders of this whenever we go.  I am also a big fan of the chives dumpling since I am an onion lover.  Each of the dim sum above is in the $2 - $4 range for each serving.  Not too cheap but not so expensive it breaks the bank.  I've had better dim sum in other places but I think for Las Vegas it is pretty good.  Not to mention, dim sum all day?  It appeals to a lot of (drunk @$$)people here.    I've seen the restaurant menu but have yet to try anything off of it.  But it does have a massive amount of choices which is good.  But for now, dim sum me up...baby!  Verdict?  Orchids Garden is a good spot for some decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim sum comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK, although some folks say the service can be a bit rude.  But then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  So the next time you have a dim sum craving and can't decide where to go, give Orchids Garden a try.  Just remember, it's off of Sahara and not Spring Mountain!"}
{"text":"I equate Orchid Garden to the Wal Mart of DIm Sum.    It is large, busy, open all the time, and has it all.  It is certainly not the best dim sum available.  However, you continue to frequent it due to its convenience and mass appeal.    Prices change depending on whether or not you are Chinese.  That is certainly annoying.    Since it is generally busy, the food is usually hot.  That's a major plus!   I been many times, I'll go again - fully knowing, it's not the best but just fine."}
{"text":"I have tried every Dim Sum place in Vegas and this is by far the absolute best and one of my favorite places to get my Dim Sum fix on!   Plain & simple this place knows how to do it right. Everything on the dim sum menu is incredible and consistent. The prices are very good and affordable. I love that they serve dim sum all day, everyday.   Sometimes when I am on my way to the movies I love popping in & grabbing a few dumplings & satisfying my tummy. It's quick and you never have to wait long for your food.   My fave items I always get are: pork shiu mai, shark fin dumplings, sticky rice in lotus leaves, pan fried chive dumplings ( the best ever ) and baked bbq pork buns that are so heavenly,  with the perfect combo of sweet, salty, sticky, it's like heavenly crack!  No matter where you are in the valley, this place is so worth traveling to! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum because some of the girls don't have the access to it as easily as we did, Bay Area-ners. The food was mediocre, of course nothing is in comparable to the bay's Chinatown dim sum but since we were all starving after a long night and day of waiting for people to get dressed it hit the spot perfectly. the shrimp dumpling was awfully small dried and the rest of the food was tedious in its portion.   Normally, I would give it a 2stars but since It served all day and the bill came put to be only 60$ for 7 people ....I will simply forgive them and add an extra one star"}
{"text":"Dim sum all day! Good selection of dim sum. You can also order off the menu if you wish. I really enjoy the honey bbq buns, the shrimp dishes, and the almond cream buns. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"This is the place we go to for dim sum in Las Vegas. They offer a good variety and are consistent with their flavors. Our favorites are the pineapple buns, har gow, su mi, and rice noodles. On a recent visit, we tried over 15 different items and they were all excellent."}
{"text":"I like OG because they serve dim sum until 10:30p  Dim sum is served in carts. There are ladies pushing around carts of different types of dimsum. There is a steamed cart, fried cart, starch cart, sweets, and buns.   You get a card and the things on each cart have a different price depending on the cart. When you get an item, the lady will put a stamp on your card. They add up the stamps and that is your food cost.  Be careful grabbing too much. The items have between 1-4 and cost over $2-$6 each, so that quickly adds up. They also have a normal menu.  I've been eating dim sum since I was a good and all of their dishes are good.  Nothing is necessarily great, but definitely good.  I would say definitely try to go during peak hours because the food is more fresh.  Most of the items are different forms of dumplings.   They also have fried shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and other things aside from the dumings.  Try the fried stuff. Try the stuff with chili sauce, try the stuff with their mayo.  The cashier girl is super rude. She never says hi, thank you, or smiles.  I prefer this place over Cathay house because their servers don't skip tables!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a 4 star but I had a good experience here. Quick, efficient service. Quality food, decent price. Definitely would come back again!!"}
{"text":"The Chinese food is nice and greasy and dirty just how all Chinese food should be. You want that feeling like you're in China and its so busy that you can't even in move in the restaurant it brings you back to the moments that you really cherish on the food. I like the dim sum here. When you get first dish you want to take that puppy on a date and just hangout with it for about 30 minutes and then you say see ya. Great place to grub and chow down haha"}
{"text":"Quick.  Friendly service.  Very fresh.  We went on a weekday around 1:30pm and the carts were very fresh.  The dumplings were some of the best I've had.  This place is probably my go-to place for Dim Sum in West Las Vegas.   I highly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Went here today. Waitress did not understand English . Ordered so dim sum asked if they had crispy gau gee the lady had no ideal what I was asking. She walked away. I was waiting for more carts to come out and there where 4 workers talking in Chinese ( I think) at the register.  Very poor service when it comes to ordering but very fast to clean your table."}
{"text":"This place is the cats meow it's probably one of the best places for dim sum in Vegas check it out you'll love it make sure you get shumai and Hakkow.  Sure to get the sesame balls for dessert they're great with Tea"}
{"text":"Great service, good Dim Sum. But what do I know? I'm a stupid American... LOL"}
{"text":"Dim sum here was A-OK - but no better than that.  Definitely subpar vs. dim sum houses in the SF Bay Area!!!    Carts came around regularly, but didn't have much variety. Har gow was tasty (and the shrimp seemed fresh), but very small.  Baked shar siu bao was very good, excellent bbq pork, sweet bun. Steamed shar siu bao was good, but small. We kept asking for the xiao lum bao Shanghai dumplings, and the cart ladies said \"it's coming!\"  Finally we asked a waiter, and she said you had to order it--and it'd take 15 min.  Meh!  Had they admitted this the first time we asked, we could have ordered it and enjoyed it! Crab claw balls were huge--the shrimp ball part was delicious, but the actual crab claw was tiny and crab meat wasn't good (tasted previously frozen) Deep fried shrimp dumplings were excellent, tasty/fresh/crisp. Gai lan was tender and delicious, but VERY small (both in terms of the size of the vegetable stalks and in quantity on the plate compared to any Bay Area dim sum house) Mango pudding was regular."}
{"text":"Some of the wait staff could be better in customer service. Food is good. Sunday  are usually busy.  One waitress always nice. I forgot her name."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum. This place serves dim sum all day which was great since we were out of towners and it was a great place away from the strip.   We ordered several dishes, siu mai, fried shrimp balls, eggplant w/ shrimp, chicken feet (flavorless..a miss), tendon, house fried rice, and a few others. Everything was delicious and worth trying.   My only complaint was that the steam cart kept staying on the same side and all the good stuff went quick then restocked and went to the other side. Heads up you might need to wave them over if you cant wait.   Pricewise it was good deal. Dishes were not too pricey."}
{"text":"The food is always very good. They people that serve the dim sum seem a little rude and unhappy but hey the food is amazing so it makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place is an authentic Chinese restaurant. They have a great dim sum menu and have good service. The dim sum servers are a little pushy but other than that, this place is a must. Dim sum is served all day, unlike other places, so this place is already on top of my list for Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"So it's a big off the beaten path, but they serve dim sum all day! Everything is served via Shanghai style carts. For an all day dim dim place, I was surprised to find the dim dim is hot and ingredients tastes fresh. The servers were not rude and speak both English and Chinese. I'll be back if I am visiting the area and craving dim sum."}
{"text":"Came here at 1030 am on Saturday. Right when open. Good standard typical dim sum fare. Good was good. Atmosphere clean and service was attentive. Will definitely come back. In and out in 30 minutes but we kinda eat fast."}
{"text":"Fabulous and just as one would hope for in a Dim Sum palace. Every dish was excellent, carts were plentiful and choices varied. We left full, satisfied and wishing we could have eaten more."}
{"text":"We were told to go here for Dim Sum because they serve it all day long.  Yes this is true, but I hope to never have the \"pleasure\" of having their food again.  Nothing was fresh, many things were still frozen on the inside and our table was dirty.  On top of everything else if it were really a great financial deal I would still tell people to go here and get a cheap meal, but it cost as much as our favorite dim sum spot does who has exceptional food.  BIG hint, there weren't any Asian clientele.  They definitely cater to an American client who doesn't know better.  This is a definite pass for us."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best dim sum places I've ever tried... and it's not even in my home town! Visited Vegas for independence weekend (2017) and after consuming buffets after buffets, the hubby and I wanted to venture outside of the strip. Found this little gem on yelp and decided to give it a try! We are avid dim sum eaters and seem to draw interest in trying a new place every time we travel outta town.   From the exterior, this place is nothing special. Typical mom and pop restaurant that's stuck in ancient Asian decor. We were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was and was seated right away. The manager (we think that's who it was) took our drink order and carts of food just started rolling our way.   Let me tell you, everything was DELISH. We had 2 orders of shrimp/crab fried balls, 1 order of shrimp hakkou(?), 1 order of chicken feet, 2 orders of rolled pan fried noodles, 1 order of Chinese broccoli, 1 order for pork bbq buns, 1 order of egg custard cupcakes, 1 order of steamed cream buns and 1 order shrimp rice noodles. Our tab was just under $60. Not bad as we walked away with our bellies full and a great experience.   Customer service was indeed slow however, the manager lady who watched over our section was very attentive when called upon.   Overall, if we are ever in Vegas again, we will definitely make this place a tradition to stop by!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite for Dim Sum it is almost always busy and the seating is fast even though some days you might have to wait a bit.  This is authentic Chinese Dim Sum and Dim Sum service if you do not know what you want by the looks of it you will not get much help from the cart ladies they are polite but curt and will just start handing you things.  I know that is a bit of an oxymoron but most who go here will understand.  Please do not let this deter you from enjoying the goodies they serve in their little tins of goodness.   I know what I want by looks and name so that is extremely helpful in these kind of situations!   My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  It seems as of late the word has gotten out because there are more and more people from other ethnicities visiting here they now just bring a fork instead of having to ask for one (I do not ever need one though but I know some of my friends and visitors do)  I also noticed a lot more smiles from the cart ladies as of late as well!  LOL I kinda like the grumpy, curt all about the food service of the past a bit.  However the food does not lie I do enjoy the Dim Sum and will continue to come back on a regular basis.  I have never even looked at the menu so I have no idea what else they have but who cares really its Dim Sum all day!   One tip I have learned from my boyfriend and his family in my many years, is drink the hot tea even if you are in Vegas and it is 116 outside, it helps digest the oils from the food and calms your stomach."}
{"text":"Dim sum... All day!? I have the option to get my dim sum fix for dinner?  Pretty cool.  Not the best dim sum, but still tasty.  Items seem small, had to order more items than usual to get full."}
{"text":"The food is really fantastic, chive dumplings and char siu bao and shu mai were _amazing_. The shrimp was juicy and had that authentic snappiness to it, everything was well cooked and not unnecessarily greasy (as Chinese food inherently is...) The egg custards were so good we ordered a second round of them instead of trying something else, they're pretty much flan in a pie shell.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced - a huge dinner for 3 only ran us 50$ with drinks - and the menu on their site does have correct prices even though the first page says it's out of date. The few things we wanted that weren't visible on the carts when they came by (roast duck and mango pudding), all we had to do was ask the cart pusher lady  and she came back swiftly with them.   Caveat: There is definitely a slight language barrier and a big cultural barrier here. The lower reviews that I saw claim the service is bad, the staff is unfriendly, etc but those people are too ethnocentric to even fathom that service has different meanings in different cultures. Yes, by American sugar-sweet service standards they are brusque and short and strictly businesslike but this place is MUCH more friendly and 'Americanized' service-wise than most more-authentic Chinese places I've been to. Anyone who feels they were treated rudely probably just can't fathom that anything that isn't bowing at their feet is directly attacking them.   Disclaimer: this is the first and only dim sum restaurant I've been to. Maybe it's not on par compared to places in California as other reviewers have posted, but I don't live in Cali and 7 hours is a bit of a trip to make for dinner, so ;)"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite dim sum in Las Vegas. Sadly, I live in SD now and the dim sum in SD sucks... so whenever I come home I always go here :)"}
{"text":"My new place for dim sum in Vegas. Everything seems to be well prepared and not too greasy. Would give only three stars, but the egg custard buns are simply amazing. I've never had better. So fluffy and perfectly soft and firm in all the right places. What was I talking about?"}
{"text":"I didn't write a Good Review of this Establishment, So Here is a Revised New Review...  Orchids Garden is Located on the Corner of Sahara and Lindell. They do have a Parking Lot that is also used with the Other Businesses in the Area. They have Restrooms located on the Right of the Entrance, and to the Left is the Restaurant. You Have to Wait to be Seated by the Cashier, * Just a Note: You May have to Wait a While, Depending on How Busy they are.  Once Seated, You will be Greeted by your Waitress, She will leave an Order Tab at your Table which will be used for when you start to order from the Carts that come around. * Get the Hot Green Tea, it's Delish!  You will Notice Servers pushing Carts around the Restaurant, that's where you Start Your Meal! It is Dim Sum, so don't expect Rice, Unless you Order it! The Dim Sum Selection is a Little Limited, and it Varies from Time to Time..You can Also Order \"Family Style\" just ask for a Menu!  When Ordering Dim Sum, the Order Tab will be Stamped by the Servers, and You get your Dim Sum, Hot & Ready! Depending on what you Order, it is usually 3-4 Pieces, Per Dim Sum. My faves are the BBQ Pork Bun, Pork Hash, And a Shrimp Dish with Spinach & Watercress, Wrapped & Steamed (looks like a Bigger version of the Pork Hash). Sorry, I don't know the Name of it...lol! (One More Pointer I should Give You...the Servers are a Little hard to Understand, so You can just Point to what you want, or Ask them)!  Service is either a Hit or Miss, but Worth Trying!! Dim Sum Served All Day....Every Day!  :)"}
{"text":"In the mood for dim sum in Vegas? This is the place to go. A very friendly staff and plenty of food to go around. It's not exactly on the strip but not very far from it. Fried shrimp, dumplings of all kinds, seaweed salad, sticky rice, the list goes on and on. A couple friends i was with got general tso's chicken and another chicken dish on the side, both looked great. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the random final fantasy music they got playing everything I come here.    Food is good when they have it.  Even when busy they don't always have their full assortment of dimsum.  Good place to go away from the strip and all the second hand smoke."}
{"text":"This was my second time here at this dim sum restaurant. I enjoy coming here because the food, service and wait time are all great.  Food: Huge selection and variety of choices. From your basic dim sum choices like the broccoli, shumai, puff pastries and chicken feet. Only thing that I was disappointed in was how often the food came around. Sometimes there was no more left of your selection by the time it got to your table.  Service: Waiters and waitresses could have done better of making sure that there tables have refills and water filled up.  Ambiance: the place sits a ton of people. We were a table of more than 12 and we only waited about 20 minutes. The in and out service with turnaround is great!  The bathrooms and aesthetics could use more touch up."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dim sum place in Vegas.  Look, I've never been to Chang's.  I've heard it's pretty good too...  but shoot, this place is pretty good.  It'll stand up decently too in San Francisco, where I'm from.  It won't be the best place -- but it'll be a place I'd frequent regularly for the quality and value of the food.  Why, you say?  Cuz their baked goods are, well, GOOD!  Try, for examples, the miniature baked BBQ pork in a buttery, flaky pastry.  Love it!  The miniature egg custard.  Well done!  The crust is good...  the custard... well, they could use a little more egg whites.  But in any case, their baked goods are excellent!  Har gow, Shumai, Lo mai kai, fried shrimp dumpling, chicken feet, cheung fun (you know, the regulars), these all are pretty good.  I stuffed myself with 5 plates and it cost me $12.50 + tips.  One last thing...  I haven't tried Chang's yet -- I'm going to.   But as far as I'm concerned, Orchid Garden is as authentic as it's going to get in LV.    I walked in, for the first time, one Sunday early afternoon and was greeted by the loud clanging of chopsticks against plates and the familiar hum of hundreds of loud conversation melded into one -- now that's an authentic dim sum joint."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of dim sum! and I have been coming here for years, actually its really the only place I get dim sum.   I would recommend going before 3 (I believe) because they raise the prices per dish after that.  I would also recommend the pork shumai, shrimp wonton with mayonaise dressing, salty spicy squid, the barbecue pork bun, and the sweet rice cake for dessert!  and off the menu order the yang chow fried rice.   2 people can eat well for about $30 bucks. If you go on the weekend it gets busy around 11 and usually dies around 1ish. Sometimes its not that bad if it is busy because then the carts are always moving and passing you. Sometimes when it is slower you might have to wait longer for what you want to come around."}
{"text":"I only eat one thing from dim sum carts, the steamed pork buns. These were ok, similar to the ones found in the frozen foods section at the supermarket. The food from the regular menu was nothing special either. For the price, I expected better."}
{"text":"BEST DIM SUM IN TOWN!! You get in quick good is great staff is friendly. Nothing better!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the dim sum. In fact, I liked it so much,  I came here 3 days in a row. The place wasn't too clean though,  and the bathroom was a shame.   What I detest was the heavy middle-aged woman at the front desk. If you understand Cantonese, you'd be wondering what's going on in her head. Her language was so abusive that I cringed every time I heard her yelling at the staff. \"You are a retard\", \"You have Alzheimer's?\", \"Move faster ... You are not a handicap! \" ...   I think she's related to the owner. Regardless, that's not the way to treat others. Those poor staff (mostly middle-aged women like her) needed the job and appeared terrified of this angry woman."}
{"text":"It's are go to dim sum place when we go to Vegas. The service is good and the dim sum in descent. It's always fresh but go early because they run out of certain things like egg custard. I love the dumplings and the Chinese broccoli."}
{"text":"I have to agree with my friends, Ms. Stefany and Phillip T.  \"The options for Dim Sum are limted in Las Vegas\".  This as good as you are going to find for Dim Sum in Las Vegas.   Unlike Cathy House, and other Chinese establishments in Las Vegas, the Dim Sum is prepared throughout the day, so you will get fresh, and not reheated, Dim Sum when the carts come around.  I always do the Dim Sum. My wife used to order Chinese entrees, until she finally realized they were not that good, and switched back to Dim Sum.   The place is large, and at lunch time, very loud. Dinner is a little less hectic.  Service is on the slow side. In the Asian tradition, don't be affraid to raise your voice to get service at your table, or they may ignore you.   They don't expect much of a tip, and don't appreciate a generous tip. Many of the Chinese patrons dont' tip; it's a cultural thing.   If you are on a date, and want to impress someone with your knowledge for \"off the strip\" or \"local\" places, or simply to introduce some one to Dim Sum, this is a decent bet.  If you are thinking of impressing someone with atmosphere, and deep conversation, go to Tao, a Rich Man's PF Chang's."}
{"text":"Man, I love Dim Sum. There really is something with people just walking around with carts and carts of food. It's almost spiritual. This place is pretty awesome. Lots of variety, everything tastes really good and fresh, and the prices very fair. I really like the shrimp and chive dumplings, the fried shrimp and crab balls, and the Chinese broccoli. Always gotta get that steams Chinese broccoli with the sauce. It's delicious and will make you feel better about your life somehow. People sometimes say their eyes are bigger than their stomach, but I think mine are pretty close. I've been here a handful of times and I think I've tried the majority of the menu. Good stuff. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has improved from ordinary to extraordinary.  On a Sunday at 1pm, it was packed. We were seated right away and drinks were ordered. The Dim Sum carts came by soon after and it all looked fresh. The staff was friendly and efficient.  I was amazed at how well this place operated. Customers kept on coming in and the Dim Sum was plentifully and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden jewel at Las Vegas. I didn't know such place existed, until I yelped it.  There are variety of dim sum choices, and as you enter the restaurant it's already packed with people.  This mean that it's really good.  The good thing about it is the diversity of people that enjoys the dim sum there.  Furthermore, the waitresses knows how to speak English really well!! This is the only place that I've heard clear English being spoken!! Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Known for its Dim Sum, this place is always pretty busy. You can tell from the parking lot and the crowd-filled lobby. We hadn't been here in a long while. Seems to have caught on with many other people, as the clientelle today was a huge mix of people: Asians of all types, Hawaiians, and Caucasians. Don't even come here on a holiday weekend as you will wait for about 30-45 minutes (we did that once- we won't make that mistake again).  It's still yummy! We had the chinese broccoli (steamed just right), sio mai, shrimp balls (mmm, another favorite), shrimp on the sugar cane (one of my hubby's favorites), pork buns (another hubby's favorite), egg tarts (one of my favorites, but then I saw the sesame balls... darn), and rice cakes (love this!). I had the hot tea (good stuff, so fragrant) while he had water. We didn't finish everything- we had leftovers. Less than $26.00 plus tip. Maybe next time we won't wait so long, to come again.  (BTW, there's way more other dishes (noodles, chicken feet, tripe, rice, wide noodles with shrimp, soup, etc.) that they have- the ones that we get, just happens to be our favorites.)   The service is very good. We were seated right away, maybe because were just a party of two. The server brought us drinks right away (and refills too). Although, very busy, the servers are pretty quick, pushing the heavy food-filled carts to every table in the restaurant. Some of them speak english, some do not. If you're not clear (repeat yourself) you might get another dish by mistake. They stamp your card accordingly after you make your selections. When you have empty plates or containers on your table, someone comes over and grabs them.   There are two sections to the restaurant. A bathroom is located in the lobby. There are TVs all around, but because there are so many diners, you only just see the screens and can't hear them. But that's ok, because you're in the company of good eats!   This place has been around for years; the name might have changed a few times, but the food is still top notch. Definitely still The place for Dim Sum. I'm getting the sesame balls next time instead of the egg tarts."}
{"text":"Service: Good to Ok  Food: Good  Restaurant: Good, Accommodates Large Groups  Return Visits: Yes, every week!  Favorites: Pork Shiu Mai, Chicken Feet, Sweet Yellow Bun, Shrimp Noodle, Chinese Broccoli, Fried Dumpling, Chow Fun and other things that we just point at because when we asked what they are, they say something we can't pronounce :)   We are here every Sunday because food is really good! Yes, sometimes the service is slow and sometimes the item that we want isn't \"ready\" yet but we are always happy when we come here. We're here so often that most of the cart ladies know who we are and know what we like! We take out-of-towners to Orchids Garden and it's  always a requested trip when they return!  And for those that know the typical \"cleanliness\" of a Restroom in a Chinese restaurant... Well, they actually renovated theirs, so, you can't smell it from the seating area-- like most, so you're not likely to be squeamish and it's also really pretty in there!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and thought what a great concept to have dim sum available all day. The food is carted around and constantly brought out fresh. I tried almost everything, even the tripe.  The food was hot and tasted no different than Westminster, which was like home away home. It can be quite busy on the weekends, especially with a group so plan ahead.  I would definitely come back with friends to share the quick and easy Chinese food."}
{"text":"BEST dim sum in Vegas! A chef friend turned me on to this place and this is now my go to place here in town when I'm craving the real deal."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 3/5  The best part about this place is that you can eat Dim Sum anytime of the day! Overall good typical Dim Sum place with lots of space."}
{"text":"always enjoy coming here and eating good dimsum. great price. preoare yourself by beung hungry so you can try the food. tummy dimsum, cruspy calamari, deliciouschow mein. just make sure to partner w hot tea to cleanse the oil from all the food."}
{"text":"5 stars compared to the horrible dim sum places in Vegas, 4 stars compared to the ones I've been to in SF and LA.   Clean, **acceptable** service, cheap and yummy. 4 things that are hard to find in other dim sum restaurants in Vegas. The carts came around very quickly with a large variety, also something I have yet to experience in Vegas.  The dim sum was good, I will definitely be back. No more having to wait for a trip to Cali to get my dim sum fix!"}
{"text":"This place must be good because out of 50 customers there were 2 Black ladies and my white self--and 47 Asians speaking Chinese.  I trust that means the food is authentic and good. I had a couple dim sum dishes but the best thing was the duck...OMG!  It was the first time in my life I ever had duck that I liked...no change that to loved!   Go here for authentic Chinese, peeps..you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. Not the best I've had, not the worst I've had either. But if you need to satisfy your dim sum cravings then this will do. Good thing about this place compared to other dim sum places is that it's not hard to call the attention of the dim sum carts because they really go around and make it to a point to stop at each table."}
{"text":"Service was great, the carts were pushed around often so you didn't really need to search for people and types of food.   There was a good amount of choices to choose from, but I noticed I have tried everything after maybe 30 min of being there.   Price was average.   Still one of the better dim sum places to eat at if your in vegas"}
{"text":"Good dim sum place to eat .. Especially that's their specialty. They have a good crowd. Very good on service. Food was great . Definitely come back here if I visit again."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Greasy. Not good.  What wasn't greasy was too salty. My first and last experience with dim sum. I would have rather set my hard earned $$ on fire."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and absolutely love it.  Next to LA, Orchid Garden is the best dim sum I've had. Our Italian grandparents actually introduced us to this fine establishment.  The service is prompt, the food is delicious, and it's just plain dim sum yumminess.   Upon sitting down, the carts are at your table. There's no time to waste on Dim Sum Sunday! They clean your tables pretty fast too, but don't let them rush you. Enjoy it.  Most places use a lot of sesame oil in their dim sum items, not Orchid Garden. You leave satisfied... full.... but not wanting to sit in stretchy pants.  Their pork buns (the ones in my picture) are lightly brushed with honey. The bun is fluffy and the pork isn't too \"saucy\". The mushroom shu mai is my favorite over the regular shu mai. It actually tastes like there is meat inside. If you're a fan of eggplant, try the fried eggplant (seen in my picture).  I'm not a huge fan, but even I loved this tasty morsel. The red bean sesame rolls are unreal - crunchy outside, steamy chewy inside, and the slightly sweet bite of red bean in the middle. The seaweed salad is meh. STick to the dim sum items and you can't go wrong.  Be sure to check them out and remember it's meant to be eaten slowly! Sip that tea, digest, and grub down. ;-)"}
{"text":"Food was good. I wish they had more options though cause they kept coming around with the same cart. Place was kinda dirty on the inside. Overall pretty decent dim sum place to go."}
{"text":"I once voted this place a 4/5 stars, however after today, I will no longer be a customer. I met up with some friends I haven't seen in a while and ate while chatting. We were asked if we were done eating, so we said yes. They then brought the check, which we felt was a bit rushed. So we payed and didn't think much of it. We continued to talk while finishing our waters, when the manager approached us. She said, \"we're waiting for this table?\". I said ?excuse me\", and she again replied, \"we're waiting on this table\". We were basically be pushed out as soon as they got our money. I have never in my life have been asked to wrap it up and leave. It was the rudest experience I have ever received from any restaurant. I don't care how busy a place is, you don't treat loyal, frequent customers the way I was treated. Never again."}
{"text":"When we first walked into the restaurant. There was an order that we couldn't help but think of a backup sewer. It was so bad that we thought of walking out but it was awkward when the waitress stood there asking us a few times to follow her. So, we shrugged and followed her into the dining area. We figure if it smells that bad in the dining area, we are outta there before you can say 'mooshoo'. . . but to our relief, the smell was not present.  Since we came for dim sum, we readied our plates with some hot oil and soy sauce. Then the feast on wheels.. .the waitresses were pushing out the metal hot carts. We selected quite a few dishes. All was delicious. The presentation needs to be bit more worked on but heck, the taste buds aren't complaining.  If you can get pass the smell at the front door, the dim sum is worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal.  This place has a great selection of traditional dim sum choices.  Not the best in the world, but still excellent.  Here's the kicker. . Orchid Garden serves their dim sum from mid morning until LATE in the evening.   This is a great concept, seeing as many times I want dim sum at other than the traditional serving times.  I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed.  Try it, you'll love it!  Staff here is very nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years- Dim Sum is usually good, not SF good, but decent. After today we will never go back. I have to say the staff has always been a tad rude, but since we really like Dim Sum we kept going. Today we went and there were 9 of us. My husband and I sat together, and our 17 year old daughter and her six out of town girlfriends sat together. After we finished we walked over to the girl's table and told them we were going to go start the cars. I was standing by the table trying to stay out of one of the woman's way who had a cart. Out of nowhere she literally yelled at me to move. I was a bit put off and said it really wasn't necessary to yell and we went outside.  Ten mins later the girl's came out to the car and our daughter said she was yelled at when they paid. They paid with cash and the woman who took the money came back to the table and sat down their change- approximately $2-$3. They told her to keep it as a tip. Granted, it wasn't a big tip, but they are young girl's and frankly tipping isn't a requirement. She started scolding them and yelling how they needed to pay 10% tip - she called them imbeciles over and over. They are young girl's and should not have been intimated into leaving a larger tip, and definitely not called imbeciles. What type of restaurant employee calls their customer an imbecile? Our oldest daughter is a server and we get the importance of tipping. However, it's up to the customer on what to tip ( and here there isn't much service) . I didn't see anywhere here that a tip is \"required\". I can tell you our daughter would NEVER yell at a customer for not tipping.  I thought about going back in to complain or call, but know it would have been pointless as the one who yelled at them appears to be the manager. So, instead I leave my review and let people decide. It's not the top dim sum, so why put up with rude behavior. My money will be spent at restaurants where people are kind and appreciative."}
{"text":"Go to dim sum after church. I've been going here for years and I rarely wait for a table. Carts are on a constant rotation."}
{"text":"Dim sum in Vegas is so hit or miss. And lately it's been misses. To me, there are only two competing Dim Sum houses. Cathay House and Orchids Garden. Here is my criteria for a good Dim Sum joint . TEMPERATURE = Freshness. Taste. Variety. Speed of service.   Here's my tip: You need a battle plan. The prime time to visit is 10:30 AM. This is when 90% of the time the food is hot. The crowd has yet to form. If you miss this time try your best to sit in the room in the east (left room from entrance). This is where the carts come out and you're most likely to get the hottest items. When you can't get the carts to come in time, grab your waiter and tell them what you want. Be active it's a war zone!"}
{"text":"When we went on a Sunday afternoon (a couple of weeks back), they were packed. Surely a testament to what sparse options there are when it comes to dim sum in Vegas because the food was just so-so. I remember thinking the ingredients did not taste very fresh and seemed of low quality. The one dish I did like was the smelt, though it was overly fried. Trying to think of what else we had and am having trouble, it was that unmemorable. Old building, musty old dining space with outdated carpet. Think we'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular location twice within a two we could time frame. Both times with my significant other of which the first encounter we walk in and of course someone was there to greet us and ask how many in our party so we can maybe seated. At which point we were given a three-minute time frame to wait. Now this being our first time at this particular location we were unsure as to how to order or what to expect. So they asked as a question as in would you like dim sum me not knowing what that was we said sure. I wish someone would have told me that they will be pushing around cart asking if we wanted anything on the cart versus offering a menu at the time. Once we got past that awkward encounter everything was wonderful the food was great the service was decent enough, nothing to rant about in regards to anything negative. I would recommend this place for family friends especially if we're going to try something new and something authentic. I thank Orchid Garden so very much with experience and will be a regular there from here on out."}
{"text":"Decent Dim Sum especially because they serve Dim sum at all hours of the day when traditionally Dim sum should be more of a morning / morning brunch never after 2pm. The dim sum here is decent, I usually go here because ping pang pong has a super long wait and so does Changs. Decent but does the job I should say. This place is huge and gets packed between the hours of 9am-2pm crazy busy. If you've never experienced Dim sum its a great experience. Asian ladies pushing around metal carts to each table with asking \"what chu want wha chu want\" HAHA sorry I must make fun of my people. Its a super loud place so be prepared to scream across your table (okay maybe I over exaggerated that just a bit). Well like I said decent, nothing really to comment about this place other than it serves dim sum all day. That's pretty much the only good thing about this place. Parking is horrible, the place has a super small and limited parking spots & we all know Asians suck at driving. So just imagine small parking lot & Asian drivers."}
{"text":"This was only the second Dim Sum place we have eaten at in LV.  But no need to search for another one.   It was really packed and we waited for a while before we were seated.  But that is a good sign so no complaints there.  They just needed more bench and chairs for the older folks so they can sit while they wait.    The dim sum is fresh, warm and you can even order what you do not see.  Go before the busy time so you don't wait long.   My fave there is the calamari.  I love the egg pie, the crust is soooo flaky and yumms.     This place was highly recommended to me ....I highly recommend it to everyone.....!"}
{"text":"Another day, another family Chinese dinner. We seriously love going out for Chinese whenever we're celebrating something or we're just near a Chinese restaurant. And we love dim sum. The fact that this place serves dim sum all day is a bonus.  We got there at around 8 pm. The place had a decent amount of patrons, but had plenty of free tables. We got our usual dim sum staples of pork siu mai, shrimp balls, and miscellaneous dumplings. We also ordered Sesame Chicken and Hong Kong-style Noodles with Seafood.  The dim sum was pretty good considering it was in the evening. The sui mai was soft and pretty juicy. The shrimp balls were big and tasted great with the sweet mayo.  And I cannot recommend soy sauce mixed with some chili oil enough!  The sesame chicken wasn't anything special. Good but nothing noteworthy. The Hong Kong-style noodles were great, though. More noodles and the sauce wasn't bland like at other places.  The servers were also decently friendly, got us water, and speak English. Additionally, none of them mistook me for being Chinese! It was probably because my parents were with me and they look more non-Chinese than I.  This is the first time we ate here. Thanks to my friends for recommending this place. I'm adding Orchids Garden to my list of go-to Chinese sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here and didnt know what to choose from, so I winged it.  They serve you with a cart full of food when waved down.   Careful though because they pressure you to eat everything you try to look at.  Recommended to the people familiar with the cuisine. Lol"}
{"text":"Wowie! Dim sum ALL DAY for DIRT CHEAP prices!  My group of people wanted some good Chinese food, so with some advice from one of my friend's local relatives, we strayed away from The Strip and came here.   They had all the normal dim sum goodies... sui mai, BBQ pork buns, flour rice sheet with shrimp, deep fried shrimp balls and more! Everything was pretty fresh and I DIDN'T get sick after eating here. Amazing! I loved their desserts. They had mango pudding and this fabulous sweet egg custard bun (not made with the typical white bun, but more like a pastry). They're Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. I thought the black bean short ribs had a strange taste to them. But overall, I had a great experience here.  It's definitely worth coming here if you want to get away from The Strip and pay REASONABLE prices for some good food. To feed NINE people it only cost about $80, including tax AND tip. AMAZING! Another time we ate there, it only cost about $50 to feed all nine of us again. It's almost a miracle that you can even eat for that cheap in Vegas! Don't let this miracle slip away!"}
{"text":"The food here was just alright. Read: it tasted just like buffet food.   I fell for the commercials they had airing on The Filipino Channel at my parents' house so I had to check them out, haha.  Servers push carts around with those little buckets with dim sum and other items on the menu. The dim sum definitely reminded me of those served at your typical $12 a person Chinese buffet. The food is served quickly and some of the items are unfortunately lukewarm since they've been sitting around for awhile.   As for the service, it was kinda inattentive but I wasn't really surprised. Unless I find another REALLY GOOD dim sum place, Orchids Garden will be the go-to spot for now. This place would probably be super tasty if you're high or if you're just super hungry."}
{"text":"Great dim sum all day location! Prices are a bit high than other dim sum locations but this place offers it ALL DAY! Save room for dessert and get the rice cakes along with the baked sweet cream buns! They are amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't ever leave bad reviews, but after the service I got from this place I couldn't help it. It's right up the street from my house so I've always wanted to try it, so on 7/20 around 9:30pm I went with a friend. I love dim sum. When I told our waitress I didn't eat pork, a few dumplings I ordered contained pork which they didn't tell me until after they made it and dropped it to my table.. I had to tell them twice I don't eat pork and the lady literally yelled at me & was speaking a different language to the other servers and YELLED in the kitchen. I'm not sure if she's the manager on duty or just a server, but when I tried ordering other options, her attitude was horrible &  she kept huffing, puffing & rolling her eyes that she was serving me or when I was asking questions.. I am a server & a bartender in 2 different restaurants so I KNOW how the industry is.. I just have to say that was the worst service I have ever gotten & I will NOT be back due to that woman.. Oh & the food we did ordered sucked & was way too salty!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent dim sum!  I just moved here from Seattle and I was missing Asian good. Thanks to yelp, I found this place.  Parking was challenging even though they have a private lot. The lot was full for Friday at lunch. A good indicator if the wonderful food inside.  The restaurant was busy but still had ample seating.   The servers were friendly and the food was excellent. I was happy with everything except the chow mein. It was bland.  I can't wait to bring friends and family here."}
{"text":"Got here right when it opened at 10:30am. No lines and the food was amazing! Coming from Alhambra where there is a plethora or Dim Sum Restaurants on every corner, this place is actually high up there. The food was fresh. It wasn't too salty, and service was pretty good. Give it a try if you're feeling for some legit dim sum!"}
{"text":"Oh. Yeah! Now our new favorite place for dim sum. Offerings are fresh and delicious! Don't miss the Green Beans sautéed with XO Sauce."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times and I pretty much know what I like and don't like here.    The Baked Cream Buns are a must.  Everything else is average or I know what not to order.  We asked for the Steamed Spare Ribs and finally got 2 orders delivered to our table.  I never saw the Sweet Sticky Rice come by, but  I suppose we could have special ordered it.  We ordered the Chinese Broccoli, Chive Dumplings, Steamed Spare Ribs, Har Gow, Shiu Mai, Shark Fin Dumplings, Shrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper, Shrimp Paste in Eggplant, Sticky Sweet Rice in Lotus Leaf, Taro Balls, Sesame Seed Balls, and Baked Sweet Cream Buns.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum, but i feel like the place is dirty. I watched one of the toothless cart pushers tell me I was pretty in chinese then spit out some kind of food piece on the floor. I dont think they have as good of a variety as other places, and its kind of greasy for dim sum. Go to Cathay House if you want better :)"}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of dim sum platters to chose from.  Besides the food, the place is elegant with plenty of tables to choose from, good for large and small families to dine.  Only 4 stars because of driving distance."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a long time for dinner and it wasn't bad. Service was quick and friendly. Was not very busy for dinner but it was over half full. They now serve Dim Sum all day now so I know of a place to get baked BBQ pork buns!"}
{"text":"Foods pretty good, never had dim sum so I can't complain about anything :)"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese cuisine in which small portions of a variety of foods, including an assortment of steamed or fried dumplings, are served in succession.    Easter Sunday and it was my cousin Manny, my mother and I eating out for lunch.  Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.    The place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.  So steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.    We picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.  Overally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)  The ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.  Overall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine."}
{"text":"On a windy day, nothing beats a good pot of chrysanthemum tea, steaming hot dim sum varieties from the trolley carts, spending good time with family or friends with quick, attentive service, reasonable price and good food quality,  I highly recommend Orchid Gardens for  a desired gathering place, not to forget the ample parking they have. When I return to Vegas, I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone. The dim sum was over priced and the two carts that came around to the tables were only stocked with items that people didn't want. If you wanted a bun or something from the menu, you were told that it would take 45 minutes .  The waitresses were rude and not helpful at all. First and last time!"}
{"text":"The shumai here is to die for, it's So Moist and flavorful. It even has large pieces of shrimp inside. Service is usually pretty good. Only downside is waiting for a dish that isn't in the cart when they come around. Also the noodles they have in a small plate for $6 isnt worth it to be honest. It literally noodles and cabbage. Oh and stay away from the Sweet and sour chicken. It could be the time we went but it was minty and left a weird after taste. Other than that, would recommend the cane sugar shrimp and definitely the coconut bread."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine and coming from the bay area I was very disappointed. I spoke to a young Asian couple there and asked if there were any good dim sum places in the area. They said Chang's was as good as it gets in Vegas. They did mention Orchids Garden as a close alternative. So lunch time hits and here I am. The staff was friendly I was seated right away and the carts immediately came to my table. I tried the same dishes as Chang's which were shiu mai, har gow and rice noodle rolls with shrimp. I also tried the fried shrimp ball with fried sugar cane sticks  which I did not see on Chang's menu. The shiu mai was fresh and delicious, very comparable to places back home as was the har gow. The rice noodle rolls were equally tasty and slightly better than back home. We have a different version of the sugar cane shrimp roll back home that has a crab leg in place of the fried sugar cane stick. The shrimp used in this item had a great flavor and the texture to the shrimp ball was perfect. 5 stars and this is definitely going to be my regular dim sum spot!!!"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick dim sum lunch and ordered three dishes. The sesame ball was hard as a rock and I asked to get it replaced. I was told I took to long sitting there and couldn't get it replaced. I was there for a full 30 minutes.   The staff is rude and are only interested if you get something from their cart. There are so many other dim sum restaurants that do it right with better food.   Skip this place and try somewhere else. Especially now that I just found out they were shit down by the health district!  Found that by reading another review."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from dim sum in Las Vegas, but this place exceeded my expectations. The inside is large and spacious, and the food carts come quickly and regularly. We sampled the following:   Fruit custard tarts: pretty average, didn't feel freshly made. I would stick to the main dishes which dim sum places excel at.  A variety of dumplings (we tried the fried pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pan-fried pork dumplings, and glutinous rice footballs with meat): all of the dumplings were good and satisfied the grease and meat craving that we all had after a Friday night out. My favorite was the glutinous rice footballs, which are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and contains a bit of pork meat on the inside as well. Chinese broccoli with seafood sauce: quite good. It was nice to have a purely vegetable dish, but the veggies were coated in oil so I'm not sure how much healthier they are.  Siu mai: delicious! Xiao long bao: on the small side and not filled with much delicious broth. I've definitely had much better XLB elsewhere.  Zhong zi: quite good, but again not filled with as much meat and goodies as I have had elsewhere.  Overall service was fast and efficient, and the value was great ($63 to feed 6 of us, so only about $10 a person for everyone to be pleasantly satisfied but not uncomfortably full). I took off a star because although the food was quite good, I felt some of the dishes skimped a little on the fillings."}
{"text":"Average Dim Sum,  Pork Shumai -delish shrimp dumplings - delish duck - good green stems of something - delish sticky rice - delish calamari - horrid  Servers and carts just like anywhere else, no point reviewing the service its dim sum they try to sell it to you, take it off the cart and move on, not there to make friends.  $45 for three of us and let's face it anything that get's you off the strip is a good thing."}
{"text":"This is an all day Dim Sum restaurant with plenty of variety and also a full menu of Chinese food selections. The best time to eat here is in the mornings when they open up at 10:30am because the food is fresh off the stove and you have to try my favorite coconut bread. I also love the shrimp egg plant and the shrimp fried wonton. They serve dim sum for dinner all the way until closing 10:30pm however they run out of selection at the end of the day. It's great for big parties or families and they have super quick service. If you want to see the full review check out my YouTube video at Jens Vegas Reviews- Orchids Garden."}
{"text":"Great place for Dim Sum.  I stumbled on this place by driving from my massage at Massage Pro.  There was a sign outside that said \"best of vegas 2009.\"  I thought, let's roll the dice and see if this place is any good.  All the dishes are very tasty.  Reminds of the dim sum that I get in the bay area.  The prices seem reasonable.  Didn't notice any rude service.  Just typical of any Dim Sum place."}
{"text":"I think this is Vegas' go-to place for Dim-Sum. They serve dim-sum all the live long day and it's alright. But come to think of it, all of the dim-sum I've ever had in Vegas has just been ALRIGHT. If you know of a place that has 'exquisite' dim-sum in Vegas, let me know!....................  Orchid's Garden is a huge building that is almost ALWAYS packed on the weekends. The rolling of the silver carts and cute little Chinese ladies yelling all sorts of things is the norm and without it, the dim-sum experience would suck. They're consistent and have about every dim-sum dish you can think of."}
{"text":"They serve dimsum all day!!!!   The selections for dimsum and the food here are great!! Cost is nice too. For 3 of us and many choices our bill came out to about 40 dollars.   They have your normal dimsum selections and the service is good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and no place can beat their dim sums! The idea or push carts filled with a variety of dim sums, desserts, and other Chinese dishes is great! You can order the food at your own pace and try many different kinds of dishes. Just be careful! You might not even realize how much you eat haha! It was quite packed after 12pm but the employees quickly seated everyone. Here's a short summary of what we ate:  chicken feet was good. har gow was very good.  sticky rice filled with (i think was) pork was amazing. xiao long bao was not the best I've tried because there was hardly any soup.  Pork buns were ok but messy Deep fried fish was great and ended up ordering two"}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  The staff is rude to patrons and they aren't willing to explain what they are providing on their carts. I would have eaten more but the rude staff killed my appetite."}
{"text":"Nothing was mindblowing but after a string of bad dim sum experiences lately this was a nice change. The selection that you would expect. Fresh food, good service,  reasonable prices, lots of parking.  On a Sunday morning I was in and out in an hour at 11a."}
{"text":"It's my go to dim sum spot! It's always on point, if you want the biggest selection going for lunch or early dinner is suggested just because sometimes they won't have what I want later into the night! Always get the pork sticky buns!"}
{"text":"Emmm Dim sum. I have been about 5-7 times now and the dim sum is all day!!!!!!! In california its really rare to find a place to have dim sum all day. So these place is great. During lunch time the prices are way better than going later in the day I believe after 3 or 4. I recently just went this passed weekend and we had a party of five adults and 1 child and we pretty much all stuffed of dim sum, soy sauce and hot tea for 38.37. I was stuffed. I will be back!  Where can you find a place that serves dim sum all day?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was meh some servers were great and some would look at me like I was crazy when I asked a question.  The food makes up for it though"}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law who live here brought us for lunch on our last day in Vegas. My brother pretty much did the ordering of the dim sum. Don't think he knew what the names were just point and say one of those, two of that and so on! Everything he ordered was good. Pork hash, siu mai, shrimp ball, crab ball, look fun, char siu bao, noodles and a bunch of other dishes.   I don't think you could go wrong with any of the choices. Carts came by fast and weren't pushy at all.   You can tell this place is good when you look around and see a lot of Chinese customers."}
{"text":"I went here with a meetup group for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, which is apparently the most important meal of the year. Our organizer went ahead and ordered for the two tables that we occupied. As a result, I don't know the names of the dishes we had, but it was a pretty good spread. There was fried whole fish, some sort of century egg stew, baby bok choy, fried chicken, pork in peking sauce (I think), walnut shrimp, a sampler plate containing things like jellyfish and tongue, and probably a couple more dishes. Everything was pretty good overall, but nothing was amazing. The Chinese people in our group had some gripes. For example, the baby bok choy was really regular bok choy. Also, one of the sizzling dishes originally came out on a regular plate. They then took it back and pretty much just re-served it on a sizzling plate. Finally, they didn't have the dessert that our group was hoping for. Instead, we just got a plate of oranges.  The restaurant is pretty large by Vegas standards. It seems to be in a weird and isolated location though. I'm not sure if I'd ever return, but I like the fact that they serve Dim Sum all day. That could be worth trying some day."}
{"text":"If half stars were allowed, I'd give this place a 3.5  My family and I went on Sunday for an early dinner and unlike dumplings which were usually served during tea time a.k.a. 'Yum Tsa' back in Hong Kong, this place served them all day and all night! We ordered the crab balls, siu mai, egg tarts and from the menu, house special pan fried noodles as well as chicken fried rice.   Once they arrived, we stared at our plates as the food glistened in all that oil! No doubt it tasted pretttttttty good! The crab balls went perfectly with the fried rice and the egg tarts were a great way to end the night. With a cute serving of 3, my parents and I had one each!   Atmosphere was pretty mellow. It gave me this deep sense of nostalgia for Hong Kong where I lived for 18 years. The service could do with some improvement although I would understand that working a whole day wouldn't really motivate a smile. Just a little less on the cold approach and I'd probably give this place a 4.5 :)   Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience, comparable to HK star only with more variety on the dumplings and reasonable prices throughout the day (HK star shoots up its prices for dinner)"}
{"text":"Dim Sum all day with a huge variety ! Wanted to check this place out because it has Peking Duck.  You can order Roast Duck 1/2 or Full, but the Peking Duck has to be a full.  We decided to do the Dim Sum because the carts were coming by as fast as Nascar laps.  My favorites were: Shrimp ball in eggplant & Rice Noodle with Beef (ask for xtra sauce on side from this dish for some of the other plates that only serve a mayo sauce)  All the others seemed pretty standard or too greasy.  This place is excellent for groups  & kids,  and they have flat screens to watch football.  It's not the best dim sim, however, service is quick and there is ample parking in the front & rear."}
{"text":"Hot damn they're fast! We hadn't even sat down yet and the carts came flying by. No wait time made them an instant favorite in my book.  The carts actually come by frequently. The baked char siu bao came out so fresh and hot, it was like heaven in my mouth. They have all the staples from dumplings to noodles to bao to dan tat (2 kinds). I usually hate custards but I really enjoyed the fruit-topped one. I didn't feel yelled at, ignored, or left hungry, and I appreciated all of it.  Bottom line? 20 plates for 3 people for $50 bucks. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"It says in their yelp they close at 10:30, so we arrived at 9:50 pm. The host told us we have 10 mins to order and eat because they will close at 10 pm tonight since they will clean the carpet. Wow seriously???!!! The hostess looked at us mean because we arrived 30 mins prior to their supposedly closing time.... nice job! So much for all your advertising..."}
{"text":"Awesome Dim Sum. Great service and priced right. Fresh, hot dishes are always passing you. So much good stuff."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came yesterday right when they opened.  What a difference compared to Chang's.  From the moment we walked in, the staff was polite and got us drinks.  Carts were plenty and moving.  These ladies move fast and new stuff kept coming out.  My only complaint is the shrimp rice noodle dish.  The shrimp was small and it seemed like it was too much noodle.  I'm used to dim sum but my husband is still in his preemie stage with it.  While the food is not super awesome, it was great.  Service was the deciding factor.  You know how Chinese restaurants are.  You're lucky if they come to refill your drinks.  We didn't even have to ask.  Needless to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"First time here. We've heard some good things about this place and it was all true. The food was good. The service was fast and the dim sum was on point. My son is picky but he love it. He had seconds on the pork buns. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star. Its like a restaurant has to try to get a 1 star review from me.  I came here around 12:15 waiting for my the others in my party. When they arrived, it was around 1pm. We got seated, and I swear someone released a stink bomb in the room or something, the entire place turned into a ghost town.  @ Calamari - I ate it. it was cold. Was I in a sushi restaurant, not a dim sum restaurant? Nope. Just horrible.  @ Shrimp Dumplings - One of the orders, the skin fell apart. The other the shrimp was all mushy, as if it has been nuked in the microwave.   @ Pork Dumplings - Cold and mushy. Same texture as the shrimp dumplings.   @ Sesame Balls - Oily, cold, goopy item. Once this gets cold, it just gross.  @ Jook - They ran out by 1PM. Blah.  There were more items, but I guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes.   Some of you may be saying, show up earlier or go during prime time dim sum time. Yup, I'm fully aware of that. But what kind of establishment goes from good to suckage for the changeover to regular lunch? If a restaurant lets me order it, I can review it as is. This just shows poor quality control on their part, willing to sacrifice their name to earn a couple of bucks for disappointing dim sum. Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.  I'll be willing to give this place another chance and I'll come during prime time, but I can't see the score improving that much. Until then, stay out of this place after 1pm."}
{"text":"Four great Dim Sum experiences here and even more great meals. Over the past 5 years I've introduced multiple people to this place and have always had positive comments from all. Love the food!"}
{"text":"This is the best Dim Sum place ever! I love it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a Sunday Funday afternoon dim sum outing. Service is prompt and the quality of the dim sum is great!  Recommendation...eat slow and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were one of the first to arrive at 10:30AM on a Saturday morning, but the room filled up over the next hour.  I failed to write down what we ate, but 5 of the 7 dishes we tried contained pretty much the same ingredients of ground pork and shrimp.  The best dish was the egg tarts with the worst being the barbecued pork bun which was all bun, no pork.  Prices were relatively inexpensive, but the food quality and variety were disappointing."}
{"text":"For an all day dimsum in Las Vegas this is a must try. The carts are always moving. There is various types of good dimsum that they offer: chicken feet, Chinese broccoli, dumplings and more. This is a must try place!  Sometimes if you are waiting for one of the items though it takes them awhile.  The service is ok."}
{"text":"From my visits to Hong Kong and various China towns, i have come to realize a good Dim Sum place  has several things in common. Very poor customer service and high noise level. Orchids Gardens have both. They will come around and force their food on you. Every cart claims to  have the best food. And every cart does have great Sum Sum. Some of my favorites are the crispy pork balls and the stuffed eggplant.  Keep in mind their portions are on the small side."}
{"text":"I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.  What continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.  The food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.  Group A ($2.40) Steamed BBQ Pork Bun Pan Fried Daikon Cake Deep Fried Meat Ball  Group B ($3.20) Baked BBQ Pork Bun Steamed Pork Spareribs Steamed Chicken Feet Baked Sweet Cream Bun Steamed Pork Shiu Mai Steamed Shrimp Dumpling Shrimp Har Gow Pork Porridge Steamed Beef Ball Bean Curd Skin Roll Shrimp Pasted Eggplant Baked Egg Tart Steamed Soup Dumpling Mushroom Shiu Mai Chiu-Chow Style Dumpling  Group C ($4.25) Fried Shrimp Ball Fried Shrimp Puff Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf Shrimp Rice Noodle Beef Rice Noodle  Group D ($6.25) Chinese Broccoli  Pan Fried XO Noodle  I like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.  I don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture.   We spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty pricey but I guess I'm biased since I'm used to the Cali prices for dimsum. The food is pretty good for the most part. They have a separate menu with traditional Chinese food options aside the dim sum one for those who aren't into the dim sum choices. Dim sum prices range from about $3.20-$6.99. Dim sum is served all day."}
{"text":"Manager's attitude: First, with party of 25, mgr only wanted to give us 2 tables to fit 25 people. We requested 3 tables, first we got a big fat \"NO\". When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said \"yes\".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill  Sanitary issue:  This restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart!   Pissed poor services: dim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..  Only table who did the family style order got their food as their order.  Forever food: Pork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing.   Ordering: Try to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant    Bottom line:  I HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO EAT HERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. SANITARY ISSUE, BAD SERVICES, FOREVER FOOD WILL NEVER SHOW UP FROM MENU,"}
{"text":"I come from San Francisco so know what dim sum should taste like. The food here wasn't that great. The flavors were kind of lacking something other than salt and MSG. The selection was also limited. They had what any dim sum place basically had, missing all the good stuff.   The worst part about the dim sum, it was warm. The food should had been hot, not cold. I believe the only thing that was hot were the chicken feet."}
{"text":"This place used to be good...we've been going for a few years. We overlooked that it was dirty because the food was cheap and good. We're Chinese and sadly expect a lot of good Chinese food places to be on the dirty side. Over the past 6 months, we've had really bad food experiences.We kept going back hoping it was going to get better again or maybe the last time was a bad fluke. After 5 more of these bad experiences, we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum. The service is typical rude Chinese, and I'm Chinese. Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the \"complainers\". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill. And if it tastes wierd, it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day."}
{"text":"Coming from a girl who grew up eating Bay Area dim sum and is a regular in LA - this is one of the only spots in Vegas where you can get decent dim sum and very reasonably priced.   I've been here many times and no, you do not come here for service, but you will get offered food quickly and they do have most dim sum items you can get at most dim sum locations.   We always get xiao mai, har gow, shrimp chow fun, the pan fried rice rolls with XO sauce, spare ribs, chive dumplings, and chicken feet. We usually keep our chill with the fried foods but I am a big fan of the fried footballs stuffed with meat and the fried crab claw with the mayo sauce.   It's always busy, however, they are extremely efficient and the table turnover is quick! It's about $15 a person. It's not SGV or the Bay but the quality is still good and fulfills my cravings when I have them.   Another plus is they do dim sum all day and have some cool specials that I hope to try in the future."}
{"text":"Service: worst I have ever experienced. The cart of dim sum pass by so fast no one can look what's in it.  I asked 5 people for roast duck. They said wait for the cart. 25 minutes later a lady tells me I am supposed to order it?!?! WHAT!?!?! I told her I have been trying to order since I sat down!!  Order still not here and the rest of food is so cold. They are very attentive to the  Chinese people behind me.  I will never come back here!! I don't care how good food is if you can't get it and the rest of your food is cold then what is the sense!?!!"}
{"text":"Ehhh.  If you're coming from the Bay Area or LA, this place can't compare to some of the dim sum establishments there.  Place serves dim sum all day, but there wasn't much variety going around the carts when we were there.  We really wanted some Shanghai Dumplings and was told it was coming each time we asked.  Finally, we flagged down one of the waitresses to ask about it and she told us it would be 15-20 minutes for them to make it.  It was never really coming at all!  Shiu Mai, har gow, bean curd skin, chow fun, baked buns, steamed buns, gai lan, etc.  were all decent though a bit small compared to standard.  Not a bad place overall.  It's a bit away from the strip."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this out forever. This place is very traditional. Reminds me of the dim sum palaces in downtown Honolulu from the 50's . Can't say much for the calamari oily and tough rubbery the shrimp balls in noodles deep fried were light crust and well done . Stick to itch the true dim sum tiny bit see steamed in noodles Devine."}
{"text":"Dim sum all day? A little strange given that dim sum is a brunch item. But, it's Vegas and I was looking for something good after a night out and this sounded amazing. This place is located on the opposite end of Chinatown so it's a little quiet. I walked in around 4.00p and it was kinda dead. The dim sum carts were rolling just like if it was regular busy hours. You can either order straight from the menu or from the carts. The flavor was good but what bugged me was that some of be dim sum items were lukewarm. But, I guess it's hard to keep it fresh and warm it's offered all day and it's not busy. However, the fresh items were really good. The portions are also a little smaller which I like cuz usually after binging on dim sum I feel bloated. Plus, I feel less guilty. Overall, if you crave dim sum at non serving hours and need a quick fix come here."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in Vegas! Been coming here since 2002. Try the Flounder & the Lobster! They have the big bottle of Tsing Tao."}
{"text":"This is the only place in Las Vegas I come to for dim sum. I take family and friends here when they come visit as well.   The restaurant is big and every Sunday for brunch it's always bustling with crowds. That's how you determine a Chinese restaurant is good, it's when there is always a crowd or line to get a table.  I like this place because they actually have the dim sum carts come around, which is traditional. I don't really enjoy dim sum places where you order first from a piece of paper and then they bring it to you. Beats the fun in eating dim sum!   You get all the typical dim sum favorites like har gow and siu mai. But my highlights are the pan fried egg noodles and pan fried shrimp and chives dumplings! And always to top off my dim sum I get the pineapple bun or tofu fa!"}
{"text":"My family's been trying to find a new place for dim sum, since our old go-to place is no longer open.   The taste of the food here is okay. Better than other places in Vegas, but still just okay.  However, the one star isn't plainly because of the taste of the food. It is due to what happened after eating there...  I got FOOD POISONING. My stomach began feeling upset after having dinner there. The next day, I couldn't keep anything down. I'm guessing it was the chicken feet, since it's the only thing I ate that my family didn't (I'm fairly adventurous with my food and have had chicken feet many times at many different places, so this is more than just something \"not agreeing\" with my stomach).   Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday based on the rating on Yelp and quite frankly I don't think they deserve that many stars. Many traditional dim sum dishes available and serve from carts but their food is not fresh and way too oily. The restaurant look outdated. I've been to many dim sum restaurants but this one is just Not Good. Customer service is pretty good."}
{"text":"The service here was great. They were on top of everything and you could tell they wanted to make sure we were taken care of. They have an extensive menu, both dim sum and regular. We went with regular, a few appetizers and kung pao chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  Bad: Fried rice and the egg roll Good: Both chicken dishes, wontons, egg drop soup Great: Dumplings, tea We will definitely go back to try other things. Good chinese is difficult to find because I'm picky and I really like this place."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY! I am still in shock that Las Vegas have such a delicious dim sum restaurant! Also they serve dim sum ALL DAY 10:30am-10:30pm!  I'm from SoCal and I've been to soooo many different places and different restaurant to eat dim sum: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, etc. But I have to say Orchids Garden is definitely one of the top dim sum restaurants that I have ever been to. There prices are reasonably and the proportions and good for the price we pay. The taste of the food is absolutely amazing and delicious. Full of flavor in every bite! I didn't get to try everything but I definitely got to try a lot of them that they served. I would say 80% of what we ordered, I enjoyed.   My favorites: - Steamed chicken feet  - Pork shiu mai (must try!) - Steamed beef balls - Steamed beef ribs  - Sweet tofu (the ginger doesn't overpower the sweetness flavor which I really like)  I would have given this place a 5 star but the service was horrible. The host gave me a number  and told us the wait was around 15 mins. After waiting for about 25-30 mins, we went to go check our number on the wait and the host completely forgot to write down our number before she gave it to us so she's been skipping us the entire time when we were right in front of her waiting for our table. Good thing we went up to her to check and she sat us immediately right after. After being seated, we waited another 15 mins and I got really upset so my friend and I had to get up and tell the lady cleaning the table next to us if she can bring us some carts because we've been waiting for so long. She was very understanding and went to go get a cart and we went crazy and got at least 8-10 dishes at once hahaha. Even though the service was bad, this place still deserves a good review. I honestly can't wait to come back to vegas and go eat here again!"}
{"text":"Just left this place and was not happy at all. I got the taro and it tasted sour so I asked to return it... The manager got super sassy with me and wouldn't take it off my bill. My friends I came with have been coming here a lot and was not happy with the service as well... The other food was medicore.. Nothing to wrote home about."}
{"text":"Dim sum is ok. Service is terrible. No refilling of my drink. No server took the time to look after me so, I left no tip. Giving this place 2 stars is generous. Time to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We walked up to order some steamed pork buns to go at about 9:35pm because they close at 10. The lady was putting up the closed sign and asked if we were getting our order to go. Um, obviously since you decided to close early! Sorry for bugging you. Also, the buns have too much bread. Definitely not New York Chinatown quality."}
{"text":"I and my hubby are trying to find best dimsum place in Vegas. Well we've tried two places yet and tastewise this one is the best so far. However they dont have wide options. As other place (Chang's) was not very much friendly this place was the same. Overall satisfied but not the best. Paid $40 for two, around eight plates picked."}
{"text":"Not the most customer friendly but good food, comes out fast and real good price. It was my first time having dim sum,but I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a negative...I would! The absolute WORST service, I have EVER received!!! Every employee was rude as hell!!! We were very courteous, even with the resting bitch face, and eye rolling received. They proceeded to give out calendars to every other table, except ours. The food absolutely sucked with no flavor, or seasoning. Over cooked calamari, cold food that was ordered off the menu. Will never return here, and will ensure to tell ALL my friends and family, and their friends, to never come to this establishment!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was very attentive and the food was great. I enjoyed the smelt fish, shrimp shumai, Chinese broccoli, and ribs."}
{"text":":-|  Wow.. the place is packed... (again.)  I've been here twice already, and both times its always packed. People coming and going like a railway station out in the middle of the desert. It's definitely the food!  Regardless, I can't complain.. the foods descent.. okay, good. And the servers move food on that cart like it was 5 O'clock and the bells about to blow... (shift over.)  I've tried just about everything (except the chicken feet... ew.) Stand outs:  fried shrimp... steamed potstickers... fried taro... pork buns.. steamed bok choy... and what not.. (I just don't know what all they put in these things!)  3 woofs.. A-OK.. I'd come back, cause it was good... but on the whole, I find Dim Sum a bit greasy for my taste. (my kids loved it though)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love dim sum?!? Good food within seconds of being seated. Spacious restaurant in the heart of Vegas' Chinatown."}
{"text":"New to Vegas and been here three times for dim sum.  Tried a few places and keep going back to Orchids Garden.   Not sure why Yelp ratings are not very high.  Dim sum is good!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat on a Sunday morning. Lots of dim sum options: bbq pork buns, shrimp and pork shumai, rich congee, crab claws, pork ribs and black bean, YUM!!! Service can be a little slow at times, but this place did fill up by 11:00. And the carts of goodies are trucking along. Not as great as some of the places in San Fran I've been to, but for Vegas it was great. $27 with tip- how can you beat it? I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh, it seems like they were pushing the same thing over and over again. We have had better dim sum. Out of all the items we ordered, I enjoyed the bao the most everything else was too oily and meh.  Yeah i say meh a lot, lol.  Good place to try but won't be coming back as there are other dim sum in the area."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and the food was good but the service needed to be improved. We ordered the Peking duck and it was delicious. The complimentary soup was good and the vegetables were tasty.   However the biggest negative was the service. The waiters seemed like they didn't want the be there and looked like zombies. We had a 10% off coupon and when we showed it to our waiter, she told us to cut it out of the newspaper before they can take it. When they delivered the food to us, they didn't smile or seemed to acknowledge us. They just dropped off the food and left.  I would not recommend this restaurant based on the service we received. The food was good, but forgettable."}
{"text":"It's very Chinese here.  Don't expect service above 2 stars.  LOL, I used to came here with my mother for dim sum, it was way busier.  We would have to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table during lunch time for a table 3-4 people.  For NYE, I made a reservation for a party of 8.  I didn't know how busy they were going to be.  We came in with about 6-7 other tables.  We were the only table in here for about an hour.  I think everyone was trying to find a good spot to see the fireworks.  =)   We ordered about 6-7 different dim sum dishes.  They were all very good.  We ordered two combination rice noodle dishes (GOOD), filet mignon with broccoli (NOT GOOD, DON'T ORDER), beef with green bell peppers and onions (TASTY), 2 lobsters - garlic something (GOOD), Pork with orange sauce (So-so), and two other dishes I can't remember.  Overall, I would say stick to the dim sum.  =)"}
{"text":"if i could give this place a zero i would. i went here a couple mos ago with my friend. the service was awful. everytime the ppl with the carts would come out they would pass right by us. even when i flagged them down they just yelled at us and went in the other direction. i can't even rate the food cuz i barely had anything to eat."}
{"text":"Serves dim sum till 10:30 pm!!! Gotta Try the chicken feet!! It's bomb! Plus very cheap... won't put a hole In your pockets!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for dim sum every time we crave for it in Vegas. Always good and fresh."}
{"text":"Great dim sum. This is the first time we have been here in the evening. Even after 9pm the dim sum is steaming hot & they offer to make anything on the menu to order that we haven't seen on the carts. Delicious & great price quality ratio. Very attentive staff; excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The food here is cheap and simple. If you are looking for some good Dim Sum this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was in las vegas for vacation, and wanna to try dim sum. I read those review and decide to give it a try . Wow it has been worst then I though. All i can taste is MSG. SUPER DISAPPOINTED. I dont understand how it was rated that high. Even the tea is awkful. Maybe thoae reviewer before has never try read sim sum or just get to use to american style dim sum."}
{"text":"If your new to trying this place you're in for a confusing experience. We left this place hungry. How about an explanation of pricing or menu when you get seated? Some basic customer service? Staff that knows English for non-Asians?  Food is meh. Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the supervisor/manager helped us and tried her best to make sure everything is okay."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining here which is weird since I LOVE dimsum but I don't really venture out from our usual places (Chang's, PPP, Cathay) but we were in the neighborhood and starving so we ended up here! I think I was expecting the inside to be much bigger for some reason..  So we got our usual stuff of this and that.. I noticed there weren't that many carts going around but during the duration of the time we were there I did she new stuff continually come out on the steamed cart.. No congee here though maybe only on the weekends...   Everything was pretty tasty my only problem was, with the exception of the steamed items, everything was not hot I mean most dimsum places items are at least warm but here they were just room temp.. Made me feel like they were definitely not fresh haha  BUT I think the prices here a tad lower than other places because our bill usually comes up to around $30 and here it was only a little over $20 for 2 ppl ~   Hot tip: like everyone else has already stated.. They have dim sum round the clock..Though It may be difficult for some to order off the dim sum menu if you don't know the name of the item .."}
{"text":"Dim Sum yum yum!!   I always expect to spend about $60 when theres at least 3 people in the party. There's just so much to try.   Sugar cane shrimp ball, tendon, shumai, pork bun, sticky pork bun, roast duck, crispy noodles, bellpepper shrimp, etc etc. There's just too much sometimes! I mean, its like a dream! People pushing carts with delicious food! CMON!   My friends and family and, of course, my self love dim sum! This is one of our usual spots.  Downfall of dim dum, you fight for that dumpling. Why? Cus is insanely delicious!, OK?  But hey, bad thing about this place....the girls seem to have a rod up their you know what. Every time I'm here, there is always tude. Not all, but the main faces seem to have that \"leave me the eff alone or I will send my stubbly scarred up men after you\" look while petting her ugly fat cat.   4 stars for food, but 3 stars for the tude's and mean faces.   OHOH, FYI!! Don't come here after 8pm like we did one night. It's super limited and there was no more tendon! *cries*"}
{"text":"This place sucks now! Everything are salty, and quality went down hill. Can even finish what I ordered even I force myself.    I rather go to RIO for dim sum next time"}
{"text":"Dim sum is one of those foods that is awesome for big groups of people. I visited this place with a group of 8 and it is easy to order. We were seated in a round table and the food was placed in the middle. One thing that I wish it had (as I have seen in other dim sum restaurants) is a rotating table because it lets you pick food without having to ask others to pass the dish.   The food per se was pretty tasty. I wish there were more sauces to dip the dim sum in but I was only given soy sauce. I also wish the plates we finishes were cleared from the table faster since we had stacks of plates in the middle.   There are servers that are walking around the room with different dishes. I tried multiple shrimp dumplings and liked them. I also had their custard bun and thought it was tasty."}
{"text":"Okay, this place should be investigated for selling substances that are addictive!!  Can we just talk for a minute about how friggin' good those damn mini custard buns are? Can we??!!!  The rest of the dim sum just sorta pales in comparison...EXCEPT the chow mein...another dish that rocked.  I could go back and have a dim sum feast of just custard buns and chow mein...seriously!"}
{"text":"We've been to so many different dim sum places in Vegas we thought we'd give yet another one a try. Boy the wait is hella long during lunch time. We waited about 40 minutes! However, once we were seated, things started to roll rather quickly. They asked what kind of tea we wanted and it was brought out really fast. The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.  The har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.  Like what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy. However, pee before you leave your hotel and go early so you don't have a wait -- avoid having to go to the bathroom at all and you'll have a good meal. Very cheap dim sum I'd say!"}
{"text":"After dining at several Americanized Asian restaurants on the strip, my parents were craving for more authentic Asian food at lower prices.  The only way to achieve that was to leave the strip so we uber'd it to Chinatown.    Based on the yelp reviews I had read, this place appeared to have the best dim sum in all of Las Vegas so we came here.  We arrived a little after 10:30 and by the time we left (before noon), the place was pretty packed.  They did a good job at pushing carts around to every table and stocking up whenever they ran out.  Sounds simple, but apparently these are difficult tasks for the dim sum restaurants in Houston.  They had a good variety of different dishes, and the workers were friendly and prompt whenever we had questions.    Overall, I thought it was pretty good, and I would definitely return if I wanted some dim sum off the strip."}
{"text":"The parents love this place, for its various dim sum selections at very reasonable prices!!  The restaurant is extremely packed during lunch hours on weekends but the table turnover rate is super high; so, if you have just 4-6 people in a party, you prolly just have to wait around 15 minutes to be seated.  Anyhoo, the dim sum is totally worth the wait!    The four of us had a lot of dim sum (see pictures) of which all were delicious, and the bill came out to be only $47, including tax and tips already!  My most favorite dim sum was the fried taro puff pastry, inside which the taro paste was savory and velvety like melted, and the puff pastry was light and crispy!  I LOOOOVVVED IT!!"}
{"text":"We were heading down to Vegas for two nights. I asked dad if there was any place that he wanted to visit or restaurant that he wanted to eat at. True to nature, he wanted Chinese food for lunch, specifically dim sum. There was a restaurant that they had eaten at four years ago and \"the people were really nice\" and \"the food really good\" but \"I can't remember the name of it\", something with the name Orchid in it.  No problem said Son #1 (that's me). I'll just punch in Orchid in Las Vegas, Nv and see what Yelp comes up with. Oh, could it be Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant? Yes? No? Maybe? Look, here are some pictures to look at. Oh? That's the one. Terrific!  Naturally, when I pulled into the parking lot, the voice from the back seat goes, \"where are we? We've never been here before!\" Argggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!  So we bravely trooped into the restaurant anyway. We were greeted and seated relatively quickly. I ordered the type of tea that I like (Gook Bo, which is a blend of Gook Fah and Bo Li). It was actually pretty decent. The steam carts came around as well as women carrying small trays of food. Pretty much, a typical dim sum scene.  We don't recall seeing anything \"new\" or \"unusual\". Mostly the standard fare. We did notice that the portions were smaller than we were used to seeing. Flavors were okay but nothing really stood out. We had all the \"standards\" except we didn't order any buns.  Har gow (shrimp dumpling), shui mai  (pork & shrimp dumpling), pi gwat (pork spare ribs), fung jow (chicken feet), naw mei fan (sticky rice tamale), ngow een (beef meatball), hom sui gok (deep fried meat dumpling) and many more.  Service was okay but I think we confused the servers as we always tend to. They look at the parents and start to speak Cantonese and then they look at me and my wife and switch to English or Chinglish depending on their proficiency.  I'd say that if you're in Vegas and must have dim sum, you could do worse but don't expect the same quality that you'd find in Alhambra, Montereay Park or San Francisco."}
{"text":"During our recent visit to Las Vegas, we ate dim sum at Orchids twice.  Both times there was a lot of people waiting to eat (this was over Christmas 2014).  We waited about an hour the first time and about 35 minutes the second time.    Overall, I thought the dim sum was just ok.  I've had much better in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Actually, I think that the dim sum at Chang's (Vegas) is better too.    Price is about the same as Chang's.  Portions seemed to be slightly smaller.  However, the service at Orchids is much better than Chang's.  When you ask for something at Orchids, it comes right away.  Whereas, we have waited 15 minutes for our check at Chang's.  I just wish the dim sum was better at Orchids in both the size and taste.  Xie Xie!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Racist Chinese ladies who won't respond when you ask for something. Our table sat for a whole hour and they only came by our area once with food just because we aren't Chinese. Will not be coming back here such poor service. The manager is extremely rude as well and glared at us when we told her they didn't service our whole section."}
{"text":"On the quest to find decent dim sum in the desert, Orchids Garden was my next try.  They get major points for constantly having carts of food roll by.  The only problem was that the selection was to the minimum.  I would get all excited every time I see a cart, only to discover each lady had the same exact thing as the lady before her.  Bummer.    I give them major points for having Shanghai dumplings.  However, they were horrendous!  The skin was unusually thick and you'll never find me ordering that here again.  They also had the very special Shark Fin Dumpling Soup (Goon Tong Gow,  to fill with liquid, soup, dumpling) that you have to special order.  It comes with red vinegar and ginger slices for you to dump into the soup.  Yes, major props for having it, but it didn't taste that great either.  And instead of shark fin, they had glass noodles instead!  Their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings were decent.  Their chicken feet in black bean sauce was flavorful.  Their bean curd wrapped seafood thing was okay, some of it over steamed though.  The Chinese broccoli was slippery as heck and the shrimp rice noodle was decent too.  The tricky thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill, we noticed different stuff coming out!  I saw the Pineapple Bun and inquired if there was yellow egg custard in it, and the lady confirmed there was!  Since discovering this yummy bun only recently, I had to get some.  And it was oh so good, and piping hot too!  (It's the marriage of the Bolo Bao and the Nai Wong Bao!)    I only had the small egg custard tarts and this other fruit tart that I wouldn't usually see in a dim sum restaurant for dessert.  They did have the soft tofu, but the lady scooping it caught too much water in there, drowning out the syrupy taste.  Overall, Orchids Garden was a decent place for dim sum on a Saturday morning.  It's a huge place with lots of Chinese (ethnic Chinese, as I could hear Cantonese being spoken everywhere) and non-Chinese customers dining here.  I like that you can see non-Chinese families dining here as it can often be intimidating at these huge dim sum operations.    And the prices were pretty decent too. With a party of four, it came out to about $65 total, and we definitely stuffed ourselves pretty good too.  Until I find another place better, you'll find me here again.  The wait was minimal too. And there's parking in the back as well!  Update: 01/03/07 - I've been back twice already since this review!  And it's not because the food is so fabulous, but I have yet to find a better one.  You can easily fit 14 people at a table with minimal wait too!  And their Pineapple Egg Custard buns are so worthy waiting for!  Get them while they are hot and take them all if you can!  They are THAT good.  Update: 11/05/07 - Went back yesterday for dim sum.  Their chicken's feet was pretty good, and the deep fried calamari was a surprise hit too.  The BF really like the roasted pork that came with pickled veggies.  Their chive and shrimp dumpling is good when it's hot, and thank goodness the Shanghai dumplings never came out since I forgot our bad experience with it the first time!  The pineapple egg custard bun was present, but not quite as good when it's not piping hot.  So, only get it when it's hot hot hot!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum ever.  Ive been to a bunch of places all over nyc and nothing compares.  nothing!  this is my one must do whenever im in vegas.  Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"They were shutdown due to too many health inspection demerits :(  http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Happys-Pizza-265623751.html?lc=Smart"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and my grandma and aunt and uncle over Thanksgiving weekend. The dim sum here was pretty good quality, especially the baked dishes. The bbq pork bun, the pineapple bun, and the other pastries were fresh. These were probably the freshest tasting baked dim sum goods I had ever had. I don't even know how to describe it, but it was really good. They also had really awesome chicken feet. The chicken feet was my favorite dish especially because after I ate it, I didn't feel sick from all the grease. It was not very greasy. Normally, at dim sum restaurants, the chicken feet is fried heavily and comes out extremely greasy. I normally can't eat more than two at best, but I definitely could eat more. The shiu mai was good too, although it was a little on the tiny side compared to places in LA. It is not that expensive and is definitely a good place for dim sum in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Okay, so coming from the SGV I have to say that this place is COMPLETE SHIT. First of all, they didn't even have my beloved Siu Mai ! SUPERSADFACE ! What kind of dim sum place doesnt have Siu Mai ?! Just for that I wish I could give it ZERO stars. But there were other factors that contributed to this low grade.  None of the food looked or tasted fresh. AT ALL. The carts weren't even steamers so most of the food was COLD. The only plus about this place was that they were able to accommodate 16 of us in almost no time at all. Other than that, I would recommend driving a little farther for good dimsum in the Asian plaza. Peace."}
{"text":"This is our usual go to dim sum place. The staff is really great in the mornings but when you go in the afternoon they always seem upset and not wanting to serve guests. We love the food, but it dampens the experience when the staff makes you feel like a bother."}
{"text":"Friends wanted Dim Sum in Vegas, and Orchids was shown as the one spot on yelp that we should go to. The restaurant is large, and they have plenty of parking. Our party was seated really quick and there were a bunch of people eating here. It is a traditional Dim Sum style restaurant where you get the cart ladies strolling by promoting their food. While the quality is definitely not on par with the 626 in California, it was decent and the service was quick. Not sure if speaking Canto helped, but god damn they came by immediately and if one of the ladies didn't have what we wanted, the manager or hostess near by would place that order on the quickness.  We orders all the usual items, like shu mai, and hai gow, which like i stated above, was decent, i've had way better back home at many other places. So overall, super great service, but mediocre dim sum"}
{"text":"First dim sum place that I've tried in Vegas so my review might be a skewed cause I haven't had others to compare with. However if this place was in LA I would give it 2.5 stars.   This place serves dim sum all day and there was no wait around 2 o'clock on a Saturday. The place is pretty big nice. As for dim sum they have all the staples like shrimp dumpling, Siu Mai, chicken feet and pork spare ribs. They were good and satisfying. Portions are on the smaller side though. I didn't see a lot of new or exciting dim sum... All just the regular stuff. We ordered and ate a lot. All in all we were satisfied but it wasn't amazing and it didn't blow our socks off. We ended up paying 14 per person with tip and tax so price was fare. Wasn't cheap. It it wasn't extravagantly expensive.  They didn't also have a lot of dim sum cart. Maybe three or four they would push around again and again.   Service is good. Except for when I tried to flag this lady down for the check she just kept looking at me... Kind of weird.   Would go back again until I find a better place :)."}
{"text":"Pretty busy when we came but we didn't have to wait long. My gf ordered a coffee and said it tasted like crap so she asked for another one. The food was good and the same as other dim sum places I have been to in LA. Prices are reasonable also."}
{"text":"Great dim sum, not enough stomach room to fit all the great food we saw.  Carts came around often, and with plenty of different dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"I've had many Dim Sum experiences in many different cities across the US.  Although I've lived in Las Vegas or 5 years now, this is officially my FIRST Dim Sum experience in this city.  We came here to celebrate Chinese New Years last night, so Kung Hee Fat Chow.  Or Gung Hee Fat Chow, depending on your dialect.    The outside of the building transport you to an authentic city in China.  Chinese lettering and a huge sign that read, \"Dim Sum all day\" really brought us in.  The carpet is definitely outdated, older tables as well.  Adding yellow lining lights on the ceiling and you're now transported to 1960's China.  Definitely needs a revitalization.  The staff is cordial.  Definitely not as pushy to sell you more Dim Sum as I've experienced in other cities.  They also explain the dishes thoroughly in English so you know what you're getting.  Here's what we got:  Chow Mein - probably like 4 plates altogether.  A little oily but so good.  Small crispy noodles with grilled onions.    Fried Shrimp Puff - Got 3 plates of this in all.  Crispy gyoza like dumplings filled with shrimp.  Super yummy!  Served with a dollop of mayonnaise.      Juicy Pork Dumpling - Watch out!  The juicy liquid is hot so don't just stick it in your mouth so quickly!  Perfectly steamed.  Steamed Pork Shiu Mai - Reminds me of pork hash from back home in Hawaii.  LOVE.  Shrimp Shiu Mai -  Exactly like the pork, just with shrimp.  Still love.  Shrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper - They actually shaped the paste into a ball and placed it on top of a big square of steamed bell pepper. The pepper was a little odd.  Pork and Chive Shiu Mai - SUPER OILY.  I had to wipe it down with my napkin.  All in all, a little too oily.  My hands were constantly oily all night.  Not the best experience, I've had better dim sum.  Don't take my word for it.  Please come by and see if you feel the same!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas, NV  We waited for 40min, pick a number like DMV. We were 8 people, they sat us at the back. Usually I wait for the cart that has my favorite dim sum but guess what, it's everyones favorite dish TOO. So sit at the back and eat Crap. The moral of the story sit by the kitchen."}
{"text":"Dang this is some good Dim Sum!  Real deal with carts on the weekends.  I've been twice both times on the weekend.  While it was crowded around noon, was seated in under 10 minutes for a party of 4 once and seated immediately for a party of 2.  If you are unfamiliar with how dim sum works, there are carts that bring food around, you point to what you want and the server stamps a card on your table.  When you are done they add-up all the stamps.    This place has fresh items and good amount of variety."}
{"text":"Would give them 5 stars but the dim sum is just not up to par as to what I used to have when I was on the east coast, and I was married to a chinese woman and their family owned two dim sum restaurants that were excellent.  But the food is still pretty good :)"}
{"text":"BF and I got shafted trying to go to Ethiopian today and went completely opposite for a hankering of dimsum delights.  Our dishes-  Har Gao- good, but small compared to other dimsum places. Shu Mai- decent and was juicy, Guk Char Siu Bao-  BBQ pork bun in sweet bun instead of white fluffy buns. These were were good, nice chewy, sweet buns and the pork was nicely seasoned Har Cheung Fun- fresh shrimp in large roll noodles with sweet soy. These were good, but the soy needed to be a tad more sweet and light....I think they might have not put the right sauce since that tasted more like seasoning soy. Yeung Qi Dze-  eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste served with a black bean sauce. It was okay, I don't know if I like it like that since there isn't much taste to the eggplant aside from the sauce outside. I like cooking eggplant in sauce better- it then takes the flavor...Better yet, get a eggplant hot pot- delish!  Pai gwat- pork spareribs. One of my favorite dimsum dishes...theirs was good, soft meat with a little fat and yummy black beans.  Fried Shrimp Balls- I dunno the Chinese name of this, but it''s fried crispy outside, shrimp inside and mayo for dipping...whats not to like?  Sin Chet Kuen- bean curd rolls with pork,mushroom and bamboo shoot inside and braised in a light sauce. These are one of my favorites as a kid....haven't had in a while and it brought me back. Dan Tat- egg custard pastry cups. Not bad, but not the best I've had. Needed more egg to pastry ratio I think, but the pastry was quite nice and flaky.  Mang gwo bu ding- pretty good mango pudding. It's a nice touch they put milk on top of it...this is how I eat it at home, but most places do not put milk on it.  Yes, there was only me and the BF. Today we were fatties and had a dim sum feast. I haven't done this in all the time I've lived in Vegas (3 years) so it was quite nice to do on a occasion...it was a monthly tradition growing up in LA.   The plus here is the service. Even though the carts are limited they keep them coming. Seriously, you are bombarded,in a friendly manner, with carts declaring their offerings every few minutes. If you are looking for something on the dimsum list that isn't on the carts, don't be afraid to ask as they are friendly here and will gladly get it for you if it's available. A server also comes around and checks on everyone often and was on our drink refills. This is absolutely refreshing after some rude treatment and being ignored at Changs (see my review).  Funny that this place runs all day and has just about as much dimsum selection as Changs as well. Limited, but in this situation it's acceptable for an all day dimsum to have just more of the popular dishes and not the \"imperial\" selections. Just a note, but lunch/regular dim sum time is cheaper until 3 pm, and the prices for dimsum go up after that. Still, it is still reasonable prices for late night dimsum 3-10pm. I have yet to come before 3 during lunch, but I imagine there will be more selection with a busier clientele at that time.   I have not tried Ping Pang Pongs...but I think this is the preferred spot for dim sum so far and might be the better of the places simply because we night folk can come have it anytime. Look, it's nothing like anything in LA, but it's good enough. If I keep comparing it then I set myself up for a bad day....it's like comparing a Honda Civic, good and reliable to a delicious, polished Audi S6. It's just on a different level."}
{"text":"First I wanna say that the ladies that work here are really rude. I feel like they rush you, talk behind your back in another language and give you judging looks. Second, the food is alright. It's not worth it for this type of service."}
{"text":"Dim sum is hot, comes around frequently and the people are nice.  I do think they are a little over priced and sometimes I feel like I'm being cheated because they can stamp any price section without me verifying it's the right price for the item I got.   But the food is good and service is fine.  Oddly enough I always bring my own chopsticks though because theirs are VERY waxy and hard to eat with."}
{"text":"- I've only tried dim sum in 2 Vegas eateries.  This was better by default simply because Harbor Palace dim sum was unpalatable. - Orchids' waiters were quick to fill our requests and the push-cart waitresses paid lots of attention to us (in some LA dim sum joints if you're not Chinese/don't speak Cantonese the push-cart folks sometimes just ignore you). - Hopefully there's a better Vegas dim sum place I'll come across but until then this'll do."}
{"text":"I finally found the dim sum place to go to in las vegas. It takes me to four restaurant to find good enough standard to eat dim sum too, but I finally found the one.   I ate at changs and I thought, ok this place sucks. I try ping pang pong and thought ok, good food, worse service and dang slow, why would I eat there again and dont even get me started with harbor palace, that place just horrible.   But I finally found one that I like. Food portion are smaller, service are ok, food cart are quick and dim sum quality almost match those in san gabriel valley.  So if you are from los angeles california who have standard for high quality dimsum and already can stomach those dreadful service in LA dimsum place. This place will feel like home far away from home."}
{"text":"Had delicious dim sum at 5:30 pm Friday. Service was by dim sum carts and dishes are hot.  Clean restaurant, no signs of dirtiness. Food were hot and delicious.  We also ordered off the menu. Ginger fish, sesame chicken are very tasty. Chef is very talented.  I know there are better dim sum. But all day availability makes it a 5 Star for me"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 77/100***  Definitely not the best when compared to the kick ass dim sum places in Cali but I find myself somewhat satisfied when I come here, it's a quick fix when those pesky cravings kick in.  They have your dim sum staples: BBQ pork buns, shumai, spare ribs, shrimp har gow, chicken feet, desserts etc. I love their Baked cream bun here though, I can eat them for days! They have a pretty good selection if you come earlier, as the day goes the variety dwindles down to just a few unappetizing plates. I find it to my advantage to call ahead of time to make sure they have my Baked buns and a few other choice items. They also have a sizeable menu to order ala carte from.  Prices are reasonable and in line with the quality. Coming here is entertaining for me as well, I crack up when the ladies pushing the carts practically shove food in your faces and are very assertive with pushy high pressure selling tactics hahaha. I get a kick out of it, my husband, not so much."}
{"text":"Over priced plain dirty hard to communicate with the server always making you to hurry up and finish your meal never coming back on this shit hole"}
{"text":"Orchid Garden is one of the 2 locations in vegas off strip that serves decent dim sum.  They have the standard stuff, nothing fancy, har gow, siu mai, pork buns, radish cakes, spring rolls, etc. I saw the historical museum guy from pawn stars with the red shirt and funny hat!  He knew that I recognized him and tipped his hat to say hello!  ;)   Friendly!  Back to the restaurant, the carpet could use a touch up or a new carpet.  Things are starting to look old and dirty."}
{"text":"i've been to most of the dim sum places in Vegas, and I have to say Orchid Garden reminds me the most of the good dim sum places in Los Angeles. And the fact it serves dim sum allll day ~ bonus!!!"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 63/100  You know it's authentic when all the waitresses are yelling at each other, look pissed off and pass your table without stopping to see if you want anything on their cart. This is how we Asians communicate, don't take it personal. :-P It's quite comedic actually.   More of a 3.5 stars. I have been here a few times before, but that was a while ago. After having dim sum in San Francisco and LA, the dim sum here were okay.   - I suggest going during lunch, as the prices are much cheaper for the same selections.   - Not everything on the menu are on the carts, just ask and they'll make it for you.   - Some of the dim sum options are good and others could be done better.   - Dim Sum selections: Shark Fin was delicious and worth getting. The Shrimp Har Gow not as good, the outer layer was too thick. Shumai was good. We got a few other items, I don't remember the names, those were mediocre. See photos.   - Pass on the pork buns, sesame balls -- better quality at Diamond Bakery in Chinatown.   - The fried rice and calamari were better than I've had at other dim sum and Chinese restaurants. Fried rice was oily and made fresh. Calamari pieces were huge and had a nice flavor to it. Those were my favorites among the non-dim sum items.   - A little a cheaper on some items than the last dim sum restaurant I went to (in LA.) Our bill came out to $40, more than enough to feed 3 people and have left overs.   We came in at the right time. esp during Dec. TV was airing Star Wars A New Hope.   TIP: keep track of what they stamp on your ticket. Sometimes, they accidentally charge you for more than you ordered. This happens at most dim sum places.   - We went yesterday, Saturday (Dec 17) around dinner time 5pm. It wasn't busy.   Free tea was delicious. It was either chrysanthemum or jasmine tea. We asked and she said it a few times: \"chrysanth-jasmine.\" If you ask again, you'll most likely get the same answer. haha.  BONUS: Get a free cute Chinese calendar during December, while supplies last."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum! My family and I go here whenever we can. The shark fin dumpling is to die for. I always recommend to order off the carts rather than the menu. Love their dim sum. I bring everyone here whenever I can as well."}
{"text":"This place was recommend to me for great dim sum in Vegas. I went to take out dim sum and ask the girl at the front which ones were popular and she said I don't understand you. She was not to friendly. I was going to order certain dim sums and she said it will be an additional 20 mins, ok never mind I'll just order what's ready. Thinking they would get the dim sum from the cart. It took 20 minutes to get my order. The dim sums were about $4.60 each. The dim sums were so so. I will skip this place next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. It has yummy food and it is a great place to be able to hang out with friends. The carts are always coming and I love the atmosphere. ^o^"}
{"text":"I love dim sum and this is the best place to get it, here in Vegas! The only thing is, the ladies are non-stop! Haha it can be a good thing or a bad thing. But none the less their food is amazingly tasty, and fresh! And OMG! You have to, have to try their baked pork buns!! So warm and fresh! I must say it was my favorite! I actually wanted to get some kind of dessert but these bad boys were calling my name! I had to get them! Though I was still kind of hungry I wanted to stop so I would have room for some dessert. So instead I chose these. So sweet and savory! I'm gonna have dreams about them now. :)"}
{"text":"Affordable, good food, great for big groups! People might think the servers have an attitude but that's just how they are (don't take it personal)"}
{"text":"If you're a local or a Las Vegas guest, get to this restaurant.    You're always seated immediately. It's great for large groups but most importantly, the food is very, very good.   Their General Tao's chicken is some of the best ever.   This restaurant get's a \"Run, Don't Walk Award.\""}
{"text":"This is one of the, if not the best dim sum place in Las Vegas. I'm from the bay area so I've had my share of dim sum over the years. This place definitely has a home feel to it, and the people make it feel like some of the other restaurants I've been to back home. The restaurant is really nice, definitely a clean one, that's big when it comes to Asian places.  The food was great, just the way I liked it. The dim sum expert in the kitchen definitely deserves a praise. Everything came out nice and delicious, as well as good sizes, not too small like most places. Definitely somewhere I'll come again next time I'm in Vegas.  Be aware of lines, especially on weekends. Being a big restaurant means you'll be getting big crowds. But trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  We always make sure to stop here when in Vegas, multiple times even.  Back home we only have dim sum during lunch hours, they are always crazy busy, and all of them are located in town.    We've never had to wait for a seat here, as their dining area is huge.  They also have a pretty big parking lot, so no problem there either.  They are quick with drinks and there are always ladies walking around with the carts, you never have to wait long for what you want.  If you don't see what you're looking for, just flag someone down and order it.  Everything we get is yums and the prices are very decent."}
{"text":"Dim sum...at night! i guess thats a big plus here but dont get it twisted folks the dim sum at night is very limited.. and i think sometimes they use old food from the morning so they dont waste anything.  i will say this place is reasonably priced and there is a couple things that i find very tasty here..   Chicken Feet (4/5) Beef tendon (4/5) Both of these dishes are awesome and taste great.   fried taro puffs my favorite thing (3/5 sometimes when you bite into this it leaves an iodine type smell that i find annoying sometimes)  Now SHUMAI AND HAR-GO ( also my favorites) i rate 2/5 they need some work in this area this is your go to items and they should shine  Tofu Fa( hot tofu sweet dessert or starter ) 4/5 this is pretty good here its perfectly sweet and the tofu is very smooth. the issue i have sometimes at places when they dont execute this dish is that the texture of the tofu is grainy so i tend not to finsih but here i do .  BEST THING ON THE MENU ( Baked Bbq pork Cha Su Bao) the sticky one 5/5 this is my favorite thing here its so tasty and they put this sticky glaze on it to finish the first bite of this dish is awesome and i always tend to order this to go or i stack my table with 3 orders and take the rest home. its a good leftover as well   This place is probably the most reliable as far as time because sometimes you crave dimsum at night and its not available but here you can get it"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Price was good too for the amount we ate. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Best dim sum you'll get for the price. We took some friends from the south so that they could get this cultural experience: good food, wide selection, mediocre service, & low price. I'm not knocking them for the service, I usually only get dim sum when it's really busy & crowded so I expect them to want us in & out of there asap.   We grabbed like 8 different types of dishes for the table, but the har gow, pork buns (cha siu bao), & shumai: get that shit. Twice. Everything is super fresh, but these are the dishes I came for & they generally dominate any dim sum experience. Such was the case here. We payed about $60 for 5 of us ($12/person) & were stuffed when we finished.   Parking was full, but I found a spot quick. It's a small drive from the strip, but not anything you should come to unless you designate the time if you've just come for the weekend."}
{"text":"Great price!!!! Had Eggplant with shrimp, Pork Shumai (2), Rib, Chinese Broccoli, Crab Balls, Steamed rice, and Mango Pudding for about $36?    1 less star since eggplant was not hot......  But I will visit there again."}
{"text":"Pretty good as far as food. I like having Dimsum here. I've been here a couple of times and it's always really good. Now, if we can just let the cart servers smile... Ooooohhh it'll be fabulous ... Mmmm smile juuuust a little bit... Okay almost there , there , there ?.........It'll happen :).... :) ....... :)"}
{"text":"The worst place for dim sum!!! Paid $42 and my boyfriend threw up when we got home.  Food was cold, should've been nicely steamed.  Ordered roast duck and it was deep fried!!! Wtf!!! I'm not even Chinese but I think I could've cooked it better."}
{"text":"It's not five star, but really it's not their fault they're in Las Vegas and not Chinatown San Francisco.   And that's what I compare it to. Anyways, my favorite dishes are Shrimp noodle and Beef Noodle, because that ponzuesque sauce is to die for! Also the BBQ Pork buns, whether you go sweet or not are amazing.  I routinely come here and eat far more than I need to. The only draw back is that not enough people come here so the carts aren't always popping out fresh stuff, so things can become luke warm. But the food is still amazing.  The best Dim Sum in Las Vegas bar none!"}
{"text":"Sign outside says rated best dim sum in 2010. Well alot must have changed in 3 years. I would highly disagree..lol I was sub par at best with lack of flavor and cooking time of certain dishes that need to be cooked longer for the meats/ tendons/ and or other organs to property become consistance of how the traditional dim sum dish is suppose to be.  The service was a bit lacking as well"}
{"text":"Just got back from a *fabulous* lunch at Orchids Garden. Clearly I'm not Asian and for some background I didn't grow up in Cali or anything, so I am no expert in dim sum. I've had it a few times in Houston at various spots, but this was by far the best dim sum I've had.   We had many many types of dumplings. Some with mushrooms, most had some sort of shrimp or pork in there somewhere. Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. One of the surprise favorites was a platter of rolled up \"wide noodles\" (damn I wish I knew the name of them!). They looked like tripe or something icky, but trust me - order them!   So if you're new to dim sum and want to give it a shot, this place is an excellent place to start. Our check came out to $35 for 2 of us, but we got disgusting amounts of food. I'm too embarassed about how much we ate to sit back and tally up how many pieces that must have been!"}
{"text":"This was our breakfast before we headed back home after our mini vacation in SIn City. After reading good reviews about this place the BF and I decided to give it a try and sadly we were disappointed!   First off they didn't open until 10:30, shouldn't dim sum be open at 8?! When they finally opened we got seated right away but service was VERY slow as there was only ONE CHART walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum. I don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right? .....WRONG!!! .....When the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all. The shu mai was okay I give them that but  the chicken feet was disgusting and everything else didn't taste fresh at all.   Totally would not eat here again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, servers feel that they are irritated when serving me and my friends. Didn't feel too comfortable with the server helping us out. When I asked the server to take a picture, she also felt irritated to do so. However, the food was good just not the service."}
{"text":"Servers are friendly and organized. I would recommend the beef tripe/tendon, short ribs and for dessert the sweet tofu. Definitely a place to visit when in Vegas with the family."}
{"text":"Ok... let's face it, there's really no Dim Sum place that would ever get a 5 Star review outside of Hong Kong.  However, Orchid Gardens it among the best in Vegas.  The prices are slightly higher than places in China town, but I'll gladly pay that difference if the restaurant is slightly cleaner and doesn't have the stale \"Asian smell\" that my honey comments about.  Overall why go here VS Cathay House or Imperial Seafood???  The food isn't as oily... unless you like that kind of thing.  Peace!"}
{"text":"I seriously think they have changed head chefs. I went today and had my usual standard dim sum favorites...har gow, shu mai, char siu bao, chive dumplings, bean curd rolls etc.  and with the exception of the XO cheng fun everything tasted bland and not on par with their usual service.   The spare ribs were flavorless and tasted gamy, the har gow dumpling skins were grainy and overly chewy, and the all time favorite char siu bao lacked the BBQ sweetness that I love. Everything seemed to be missing something. I don't know what is is...but they need to get it back quick!"}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum. My expectations for dim sum is high so I wasn't too sure what to expect. The food wasn't as fresh because we came later in the afternoon. It was still good though. Price isn't bad at all since we ordered mostly seafood items which can be pricey. Definitely worth a try if you're venturing into Chinatown."}
{"text":"Though many will contest that there is \"no good Dim Sum in Las Vegas\" that notion seems largely rooted in folks from Southern California who grew up less than an hour from the San Gabriel Valley, the vast majority of natives and those born east of the Mississippi generally easier to please as Dim Sum did not even exist in their home town, nor did any Chinese Restaurant differentiating Szechuan from Cantonese.  Usually restricting the search for such Food to Spring Mountain Road, the rich diversity of Asian eateries in a three-mile stretch of pavement rivaling many American Chinatowns in terms of number but with more diversity, it was instead for a friend's birthday that the car was navigated to the corner of Sahara and Lindell, Orchids Garden gleaming in neon just as it has for over fifteen years.  Known as one of the few locations in town for all-day Dim Sum plus traditional Cantonese Cuisine, the same ownership and servers in place for several years ensuring a better service experience than most, it was just prior to 6:30pm that six guests entered the space prior to several others, a total of three tables with 10+ persons each sitting in celebration as silver carts navigated the premises.  Clean in terms of décor and populated by a largely Asian clientele, both good signs as are the well-maintained Fish tank and restrooms, it was less than five minutes after taking a seat that Water arrived and Tea was offered, the former only filled on request and often running empty though the staff did a good job of making certain that Tea Pots were filled regularly.  Sticking to Dim Sum for the evening, a truncated version of the daytime collection offered  but unfortunately already sold out of a few selections, it was as friends were still trickling in that Dinner began with steamed selections, the Shark Fin Dumplings named after their shape rather than contents an early highlight as were whole Fried Shrimp to follow while the Bone-in Duck was unfortunately not only limp on the surface, but more pricey than the portion should be for eight dollars.  Difficult to say whether Orchids Garden uses previously frozen Dim Sum or makes the items fresh on-site, likely a mixture of both given the homogeneity of certain items and odd consistency of their Shrimp Paste, it was after watching everyone at the table pass on Sticky Rice in a Lotus Leaf that a bundle was taken, the random bits of Pork ranging from ground to slices of Sausage actually quite good while both the Bell Pepper and Eggplant were not as a result of the gelatinous Paste.  Finding the Sugarcane Shrimp and Crab Claws virtually indistinguishable despite a $3.54 price difference, ten grams of Snow Crab completely lost at the center of the fried ball, those looking for something better would be well advised to order a few plates of Shrimp Balls covered with crispy Phyllo at three for the price of two, the Pan Fried Chive Dumpling also packed with Shrimp and better than its steamed counterpart, as well.  Never really understanding the point of Vegetables at Dim Sum, though every person of Asian ancestry seems to prioritize String Beans or Broccoli as part of the experience, both options at Orchids Garden were good despite the former being a little flaccid, an issue also noted in the skin of roast Pork that the waitress warned would not be crispy but someone opted to order anyway.  Falling short again with Pork Spareribs, the majority of each piece Bone and the rest of it stringy, those looking for Noodles on Orchids Garden's menu would do well to pass on flavorless Chow Mein and instead request pan-fried Rice Noodles in X.O. Sauce that is funky but not too hot and thus well suited for those with limited spice tolerance.  Rounding out the savories with fried Calamari and Smelt plus steamed Buns containing BBQ Pork plus Sausage, both of the latter plus Custard Buns rousing suspicion that frozen Dim Sum is being used based on their consistency, it was in sweet selections that the experience concluded, both styles of Sesame Balls sticky and good with a lot of filling while Mochi and Mango Pudding were fine, the later served complimentary with a candle.  **1/2:  While it may indeed be true that Las Vegas lacks world-class Dim Sum outside of holiday events at Jasmine and Wing Lei those looking for their fix can still fare well by ordering selectively at a place like Orchids Garden, though dollar-for-dollar better experiences can be found at Chang's or KJ."}
{"text":"I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden.   Dont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.  They have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.  If I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?  To put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?"}
{"text":"Tried to go on 1/26/17 and it looks like they are closed by the Sothern Nevada Health District. So I did some research and here are some areas where they got demerits:  - Imminently dangerous cross connection or back flow. Waste water and sewafe disposed into public sewer or approved facility. - Food wholesome; not spoiled, contaminated or adulterated - Food protected from potential contamination - Effective pest control measures  Doesn't sound like there all that safe or good. Really was wanting to give them a shot, but they must get a A f'in plus plus plus if they want my business."}
{"text":"Orchids is solid for that quick dim sum fix, but not for high-end expectations. And as other Yelpers have written, they sure do come to your table quickly. This would be beneficial if you're on a timed lunch break, but if you're having a leisurely lunch with your peers, just wait until the next circle around.   Is this the best, perfect dim sum? No. Is it conveniently located with quick, hot servings? Yes.  It would be great if they had someone to truly evaluate each option and work on curating a delicious, perfect version, but sometimes your baked bun is going to be a little dry or your steamed dumpling is going to have too many peanuts."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere here. I have never been in a restaurant where they bring out the food repeatedly on trays, nice and hot. I really enjoyed the customer service and the waiters were patient in their explanations of what each dish was (I didn't know what anything was). There is also a menu for those like me who are not up to speed of what each tray consists of. I recommend definitely :)"}
{"text":"I came with my family (6) on a tuesday evening ordering dim sum which was about 120.   - Rip off. For those that has ever eaten dim sum in orange county, sgv, or even rowland heights, you'd spend about half the price SERIOUSLY (seafood cove as an honorable mention)! - Wimpy dim sum. shrimp balls are so so tiny! its laughable. shrimp noodle (one of my faves. its the clear wrapper around shrimp where you put sauce on top) only had one piece of shrimp and the noodle was not fresh. seemed old and not soft how it should be. - Small portion combination fried rice. oily and gross chinese after flavor. quite possibly microwaved.   - I can go on and on about each individual plate, but if you are a local, there is better dim sum out there...just not here..sadly.. - We came here bc TFC runs their commercials constantly. advertising win. - Oh yes, one star for quick service and pretty sinks in the bathroom :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Haven't been here for a good 5 years, decided to come and see how things were.  Wait: Was actually not bad, waited about 10 minutes during lunch time, for them to set up a table for 4.  Service: 1.The server came to get our drink orders shortly after we sat down. Didn't have to wave anyone down just for tea. 2. Probably due to lunch time, the carts came around but a lot of the food was not available and had to wait until the carts refill. 3. Servers came around frequently to clear empty plates and refill the drinks, which is very good.  Food: *Shumai (pork dumpling) was not of the authentic/traditional flavor, it carries a Western flavor to it. Not to my taste. *XiaoLongBao (Shanghai Dumpling) was OK, a bit too dry. This dish should have soup when biting into it.  ChangFen (Steamed Rice Noodle), was made very well. It was soft and thin, but didn't fall apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. It is not easy to get it to that texture.  They also offer a few dishes that are not served at other dim sum restaurants. I missed eating them! *ShengJianBao (Pan-fried Pork Bun). I haven't been to a place that served this for years! It was delicious, the bun was soft and fluffy, the meat was juicy inside. *BaiTangGao (Rice Cake). Fluffy and not very sweet, just like it should be. It had nice thin layers, whereas other places make it a big chunk.  Will definitely come back another time for lunch!"}
{"text":"The good thing about Orchids Garden is that they serve dim sum all day. The food is pretty good but I can't say it's my favorite place for dim sum.  What's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. I always get Chinese broccoli, shumai, BBQ pork buns, stir-fried noodles, shrimp wontons, shrimp balls, minced meat balls, sesame balls...and whatever balls they have. These are my favorites and what I would normally get at any restaurant that serves dim sum. Their shrimp wontons aren't the best.   Now, what really turns me off with this place is that they nuke their food in the microwave. I love roast pork and that's just one of the best examples of food they microwave. The meat is warm but the skin gets chewy, no crisp and just unenjoyable.  The key to a good Chinese restaurant is the service. If the servers speak good English and are friendly, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Relatively clean environment. Responsive service. Fair prices (though Dim Sum in general appears to have risen in pricing universally).  Taste of food is good. Our default dim sum establishment. Tip: Tastes best within the first couple hours of opening.  Lots of seating. Outside of peek times, seating is immediate.   Recommended for anyone who enjoys dim sum, or first timers whom are interested. Menu on table with pictures and English names to assist, and the staff's English is good enough to communicate."}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonably priced.  I go for lunch and always get seated immediately.  The staff try to help me and are friendly, even if half don't speak English. :) I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to many Dim Sum place all over the west coast.  It's hard to find ones that are awesome in Las Vegas but Vegas is still evolving. However, this place is pretty descent compared to other locations in the valley that serves Dim Sum. Some of my favorites are the Shark Fin, Shrimp dumpling, Shrimp Har-Gow and Shrimp Noodle dish. It's get pretty busy here during the weekends especially lunch hour. Overall the service is a hit and miss but its been consistent throughout the years I've been coming here since my middle school years. It's hard to give up a place that I grew up with."}
{"text":"Good food for great price. Our group of 4 came in around 11 and were seated right away. Service was slow though, especially when it came to ordering shumai and hakkao. We asked, but they kept giving us the run around that this and that other cart had it (they didn't). We didn't get those until the end. In terms of quality, most of the food here was pretty good. I didn't like the hakkao, but the rice cake with shrimp, BBQ pork bun, and chicken feet were delish. Although it was mediocre service, I'd come back for the food and price."}
{"text":"Let's be honest: Is this my favorite dim sum place? No.  Is this the dim sum place I most frequent? Yes!  When it comes to dim sum, I have a specific set of items that I order. I love shrimp. If it has shrimp in it, I must have it. When it comes to dim sum, my husband has a specific set of items that he orders. He hates fish. Loves meat. If it doesn't have fish, and just meat, he must have it. Could I tell you the exact name of our favorites? No clue - but I could describe it: shrimp dumplings, some shrimp dumpling with green stuff in it (chives maybe?), shrimp ball with a sugar cane in it, har gow (I goggled this so that IS the actual name). For my hubs, he loooooooves the BBQ pork buns and the sticky pork buns!  Needless to say, we do not share what we order and after coming to Orchids Garden  over 4 times, we have the place down to a science.  #1 Come early. I have never been to this place on a week day and I have never been to the place over an hour from it's opening time. I read the reviews of the place, and I immediately learned that I don't think I would enjoy it as much in the middle of the week or for a late lunch. I have already noticed the difference between their Sunday service and their Saturday and have learned from friends' experiences - Sunday morning is the best time to go.  #2 don't order anything from a person who's cart is almost empty. The cart ladies work hard and if most of the stuff is gone from the cart, it's safe to assume that they've been around the block a few times. I have made the mistake and had lukewarm shrimp balls and no- they are not good.  #3 A friend of mine had said they had a bad experience because almost every minute someone stopped by their table with cart asking if they wanted something. I think he was complaining that it was hard to have a conversation when they were being interrupted repeatedly. My advice to my friend was - don't go to dim sum then. Dim sum is all about the food. In my opinion, the expectations should be a variety of hot food readily available to you when you sit down. It's not about how friendly the lady pushing the cart is, or how many times you were bothered after you were clearly full.  I am a regular at Orchids Garden because of it's easy-to-get-to location, consistency of food quality, and most of all - the price. Plus, our water glasses are always full, the bathrooms are clean, and we never have to wait to get our bill.  While there are plenty of great dim sum places around town (Ping Pang Pong to name one), Orchids Gardens is my go to spot for early afternoon cravings. It hasn't let me down once."}
{"text":"I went to this place on a weekday to avoid the crowds. the food came out fast as the dim sum ladies are very good and hits everyone table. food choice was excellent. the fried shrimp dumpling was excellent as well as the haw gaw and si mui. the place is very nice and clean , large dining room and easy parking . excellen choice for out of towners"}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Vegas! First stop after I landed at airport. Highly recommended. Chicken's feet is especially good!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here often because we miss the dim sum in Hawaii.  After wandering (for 2 years in Las Vegas), we finally decided to make our way into Orchids this year.  I am so glad that we did!  The dim sum is reasonably priced and the selection is abundant.  I would best compare it to Happy Day Chinese Restaurant on Waialae Ave in Honolulu.  FYI, Saturday lunches are always so busy!  Expect to wait a few minutes to be seated.  If you are looking for more \"authentic\" dim sum, then this isn't it, although they do have their fair share of dim sum from chicken feet in black bean sauce to steamed char siu bao.  My kids enjoy the shumai and the rice wrapped in lotus leaf the most.  But what they really go there for is the sweets!  Lotus bean jin dui (sesame balls filled with lotus or red bean) is ever so present there, just like in Hawaii (yay!).  And often, but not always, they have the cart going around serving you this sweet tofu dessert.  It's a freshly made silken tofu served hot in a sweet ginger-infused syrup.  I'm not sure what they call it in Chinese, but the cart ladies go around asking \"sweet tofu?  sweet tofu?\"  I know it's made there fresh, because the owner (I think she is one), always reminds us (she knows us that much) that a fresh one is being made ready in 5 minutes or so.  The one thing we would love to see happen is Orchids being open for morning breakfast/brunch.  In Hawaii, it is common to have dim sum for breakfast.  But here in Las Vegas, not so common.  Too bad.  The staff is friendly, as friendly as any Chinese restaurant staff could be...if you haven't been to a Chinese restaurant, don't expect too much in polite, unhurried style of service.  They don't speak English very well, but I would still recommend to stick it out and try it, or just go with someone who knows how and what to order.  If you're from Hawaii, you will probably run into a few local residents who used to live in Hawaii.  That's what I like about Orchids...feels like as if we were home again..."}
{"text":"This review is based only on today's experience,  I would usually give this place a solid 4 stars for the quality and price. They advertise dim sum all day so I exept the dim dum to be good ALL DAY!!! I usually get there b4 2pm, my last visit was a few month ago and everything was fresh and exellent. Got here at 4pm today, it was a terrible idea but Chris really wanted dim sum. Everything was either soggy or dry,  old and definitely not fresh, I am writing this review in pain, my stomach hurt, this never happened to me,  I have a very strong stomach but something was definitely wrong with the food. I hope I dont have a food poisoning.  Do not come here after 2pm,  they will serve you old nasty food that have been waiting in the steamer for hours."}
{"text":"This place is decent for Las Vegas.  The carts go around and a lot of the choices are limited and slow for new things but I get the things I usually like so I don't mind so much.  Sometimes I crave something else and I have to wait.   The Sui Mai's are good here, but the bbq buns are just okay.  I like the parking here and the bathroom is kind of newer but still dirty.   I have written a review in the past and I don't know why it is not here.  The prices here are on the average price range.   I would drive here if I don't mind driving.  Otherwise I rather eat something else."}
{"text":"Food is average. Overrated based on comments from others. Service was great and the staff spoke good English to help you understand what you are selecting.  It is dum sum all day but has menu selection also."}
{"text":"I haven't had dimsum in many years until one day Brad T. took me to Orchids garden and yummmm!    Service (4):  They normally dont serve you, they are usually just there to refill your drinks and give your receipt.  Other than that, they go around and you pick & choose what you want.   Quality (4.5): The food taste wonderful and I have tried a variety of their selections that they offered.  I love their sesame balls, pork shumai, shrimp noodle, fried rice, etc.   Atmosphere (4):  Looks clean, sometimes it has a weird smell, comfortable. Overall(4):  I love this restaurant and I would come back here everytime I crave for some dimsum.  There were a couple of times where we would get here and literally 15minutes were are done eating."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers has never tried dim sum, so a bunch of us set up a get together at Orchid Garden since they serve it all day. We ended up meeting up around 4pm after a few got off of work.   Around that time, OG was not very busy, but the dishes were still coming out steaming. The dishes ranged around $2.30-$3.30 and the most expensive were $6.30. Most of the classic dim sum items are on the lower end, but were on the smaller side compared to other places. The flavor of the dishes were good. They had most of the usual selections for dim sum. I did not see any har gow though. By the time we were finished, each person left full on $13."}
{"text":"It's okay, not much food comes out between1030am-1145. So go at 12-1 pm, You get seated right away and the food will be coming around in about 2minutes. If you want other food ask for a menu"}
{"text":"This place is a ok. There's definitely not too many good dim sum places compared to Orange County. This is the only decent dim sum restaurant in Vegas. They have a good selection and the carts are always moving. Plus their customer service is pretty decent here."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go today and my wife pulled out a hair from her wonton soup. She's a trooper so she continued eating only to find another hair! Hair nets yo! Wtf health department needs to visit this place!"}
{"text":"I went here and tried some dim sum. They really taste good and i really think this restaurant is better than the other dim sum restaurants back in California. One of the dishes was radish cake and my parents said it tasted like the hong kong street food that they ate when they were little kids. I recommend anyone who enjoys eating at dim sum restaurants to try this out! :)"}
{"text":"I lunched here last week with a coworker that suggested it. I found the dishes to be delicious and tasty. We had a bit of everything, har gow, shu mai, fried shrimp balls, chicken feet, pork buns, etc. I can't say that I disliked any of it. I will admit the chicken feet were a bit weird, it was my first time trying them. The sauce they were cooked in was very flavorful, it was just the texture of the feet that I found hard to get past. Three of us ate to our heart's content (and then some) for around $40. I'm so happy I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food is still ok.. Not as good as it used to be about a year back.. Waitress have no manners and are grumpy..."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The Dim Sum are very tasty. May favorite was the Fried Meatball, i was caught by surprised that the outside of it was made with mochi mmmmm! The Thai tea was also delicious."}
{"text":"We went here for dim sum on a Sunday. Very busy. The food is good, service not so great. Price is moderate. Different choices for dim sum with carts being rolled around in the restaurant, with items for you to choose from. Everything from shumai to dessert.  I gave it three stars because it took a while for the shumai to come around. The service is average but not that great. I would come back here for the food, yet you have to come hungry. Still, the dim sum was good, but I have had better."}
{"text":"It seems we crave dim sum always on Sundays!  However this place has it all the time, we always seem to find ourselves coming in early Sunday Morning.    We are always seated right away, and the carts start coming even before we have chance to get comfortable in our seats.  I leave the ordering to my husband who knows what most things are by sight but not by name.  I know which ones are my favorite and will tell him which ones to try again.  You can't go wrong with shrimp dumplings, roast pork rolls, deep fried taro fritter and anything with eggplant! We usually load up and eat ourselves silly before the third cart comes around!    This place serves plenty of fresh dim sum, has fast service and easy to get in if you come early!  But be warned, we have come just as the doors opened only to miss out on some of the choices when they get busier, so your timing to arrive will influence your choices, so slow to eat, take your time, and enjoy."}
{"text":"They serve the best dinner dishes among the other Chinese restaurants in town. Parking is so much easier compare to the other which can be a headache especially during dim sum hours. Plus, fresh dim sum all day long!"}
{"text":"Food ok, price ok, service needs improvement!  Still prefer the dim sum at home (in Hawaii).  Best are the baked pork buns and roast duck.  Not so good was the har gow and pork hash.  I'll take aiea manapua any day!!! LOL!"}
{"text":"If you love Dim Sum, if your into eating great Chinese food, as authentic as Beijing and Shanghai, Orchid Garden is the spot. Plenty of parking. Plenty of seating and I will be seated quickly. I recommend coming here ANYDAY except Sunday brunch as a lot of people will be there to because it's post church.. Either way ANYDAY and anytime is good. You will enjoy your experience here. Pork and shrimp Shu Mai, the eggplant, oh and chow me in are my first go too as soon as I sit down then the shrimp ball and short ribs quench my hunger. My mom first brought me here 4-5 years ago no I haven't found a better place to have dim sum except in Calgary Canada but that's a whole nother review.  My absolute favorite is the egg tart. Yes the desert.  Sometimes I order a dozen before I get the check.  I'm lying, I order a dozen egg tarts every time I visit.   You'll be happy with the service as well. It's not like they are there waiting on your hands and knees, but either making eye contact or raising your hand for anything and consider it taken cared of.   Before I forget when you sit down and order your drink, the green tea is always detoxifying and tasty, have some bucchoy and you'll start to enjoy the fine cuisine  How the Chinese do it!  Take the drive to Sahara and you won't regret visiting this fine establishment. The Chinese are awesome for this type of restaurant opening here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and can't believe I have never posted a review.  This place has great Dim Sum.  Be prepared to wait for a table, but it is worth it.  The food is always fresh as the carts go by.  You get to see everything before you get it.  The only challenge is going with just 2 people as most Dim Sum are 3 pieces.  You have to figure out the odd piece.  If this is the biggest challenge . . ."}
{"text":"Dim sum is good but the price is too high. They need to lower the price down. So many places you can go to. We come here bc it's closer to our house. Bad customer service bc they all don't speak English that well."}
{"text":"I'm just not a huge fan of this place. Dim sum is fine, but after each of the three times I've been here, I've had a stomachache and slight nausea afterwards. Food is kinda greasy/oily even for dim sum! I've had my fair share of dimsum, and don't get me wrong, I love me some msg & enough oil to make a dish taste good, but you don't have to overdo it to the point of feeling discomfort afterwards.   It's loud, there's always a wait regardless of the time of day, and good luck getting any kind of minimal service here (& I'm not expecting much service at dimsum anyways). Last time I was here, a server lady poured soy sauce on a dish from three feet up (slight exaggeration but hardly). It splashed up from the plate (duh), but there was no change in behavior from server or apology for her actions.   However, having said all the above, if you're craving dim sum, this is the place to satisfy it, sadly.   Side rant: Can we start a petition to get rid of the loud banquet hall style Chinese restaurants? Like some quieter ones where diners don't have to shout to each other to be heard would be awesome."}
{"text":"Nice Prices, Good Food, Okay Service...It was a nice place to have brunch at with my girls. It was new to me. Dim Sum was awesome and all the other foods were good. I would go back again."}
{"text":"This place was soo yummy! I'm not very picky when it comes to dim sum. I love most places but this place had sooo much more flavor in each bite! Came in at about 9 pm and was practically empty so it was super fast. Service is eh but I'm not one to care for the service (if you do care for the service then the servers are stale and somewhat stuck up) but I'm there to eat not socialize with employees lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here at like 9pm when we got to Vegas once. I was shocked because they serve dim sum all day. And honestly it's not bad!  Their har-gow is mediocre at best, but the shu-mai is still good! Service isn't amazing, but who expects great service in an Asian restaurant?! Lol  Their egg tarts were ok, and their mango pudding with condensed milk that my friend hyped up, wasn't that great.  Their pork buns are good too! I like them. I don't care for their fried rice, but I'm not a huge fried rice fan to start with.  I'll probably be back here, but it's not something you have to go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"We ended up coming here for Father's day lunch. because we didn't want to wait 45min at an AYCE sushi restaurant.  I'm glad we did! There were people outside and in the lobby, usually not a good sign that you will be seated anytime soon,  but I walked up to the registers got a number and was told 20 min wait. we waited maybe 12mins. This restaurant is HUGE! the biggest dimsum place I've been and just as noisy as any Chinese restaurant.    The carts came around pretty quickly and the women pushing them spoke and understood English quite well. I usually like to get dimsum off a full cart because I know it's  fresh and hasn't made round. everything we had gotten was quite tasty and hubby was pleased, even though his favorite pork shumai came out near the end.   I've heard about this restaurant and I've seen it while driving, but never stopped to eat. This could be our new dimsum spot, but first I'd like to come at a time when it's not so busy and see what it's like."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be the best dim sum place in Vegas (open 24/7).   Food was decent.  You can get all your usual items like hai gaw and sui mai.   I'd say Oakland or LA chinatown quality, below anything in SGV.   One thing that shocked me was the price.   It was nearly 30% to 50% more expensive than SGV.  Prices are what they are so you can't ding them for that.     Anyhow, what can I say, I'm spoiled living in SGV with excellent cheap, high quality food."}
{"text":"the food quality was good but their service was terrible. it was so slow and they wouldn't come by with the carts they were just standing around and talkin among each other (the workers) we paid out bill and was waiting for the change.. and she took so long just talking with the cashier, we were like forget it. then we said just keep the tip and when we walked to the door the cashier said, \" see i told you, you make them wait you get more tip\" i was so pissed never again going there"}
{"text":"The dim sum itself is just okay. Nothing that makes you say oooh, ah, hurry that cart up.   Honestly, I only come here for a couple things. Rice cake and their Manapua. The rice cake (aka honeycomb cake) is the closest fix I can get for my 808nostalgia. Nothing comes close in this state to finding the kind of rice cakes we get back in HI.   I know, I know...we aren't in HI. So that's why this will make-do. The rice cake comes in 3 thin slices for...darn, I don't ever remember the price because I do one of those order and just pay (don't worry...it's not a bad habit I practice). But I think it's in the dollar area.   Their Manapua (char siu bao) comes in 3 pcs as well. It's dimsum so you can't expect a huge stuffing. But they're pretty good. Their baked Manapua is drizzled in honey. Sooo good! I never thought Manapua and honey could work so well together--it does.   We always order to-go just to have something to stuff our mouths in on our drive. I don't really care for dimsum here because they usually offer items I'm allergic to or am not interested in eating. I end up just eating manapua, their chow mein, and rice cake. Then I don't think of ordering an ala carte entree because if I'm at a dimsum, despite my food aversion, I want to try to experience it the most I can.   So cart lady, keep wheeling in those manapuas  and rice cakes, please."}
{"text":"I am usually easy to please but today I have to write this today. We are regular customers here but today the service was horrible. We took a big party there for a nice holiday dinner but the way they treated us u may never go back I don't need attitude from the servers/manager when I'm a regular and brought a big party there to spend my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Got there close to closing time but they said it was OK.  We had to order from the menu because most of the carts were put away, but they did bring a couple by.  The food was delicious and very affordable."}
{"text":"Took a buddy here for lunch the other week.  I had never been here before and we were both starving.  Little did I know how ridiculously aggressive the dim sum servers were.  Do they work on commission or something?  Man.  We had 7 plates on our table within 3 minutes of sitting down because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.    The servers annoyed my friend to no end but I actually found it pretty comical.  All the usual suspects for dim sum here and all done well.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum. We got beef ribs which were amazing and super flavorful. We also got Sui Mai, sew long bao, cha sew bao, and a ton of other stuff I can't remember. But this place is legit and I would definitely go back if and when we ever go to Vegas."}
{"text":"We try this place like couple we ago. It ok!!   Since we had bad experience in Chang's Hong Kong Cruises LV. We drive around and hope to find a dim sum place for lunch... We Stop by a Chinese place and ask someone for information. He recommend Orchids Garden, so we give it a try..... It was about 1pm and the place was pretty full of people but we still got a table with no wait... Most worker are women, the only thing was I can't really tell who's waitress, who's the lady pushing the cart...cos they all pretty much look like work with everything....   We were so hungry and need to meet someone in an hour include 15 to 20 mins driving time, so we just want to eat and go.... Well, there dim sum was ok, a little better then Chang's... but it also cold... and the Har Gaw (steam shrimp dumpling) had hard skin, so as the Fun Gou (other white skin steam dumpling). What's up with these place... can't keep up the temperature.... Even you have good food, the temperature is most importance too. Yes is hard to keep dim sum on the right temp, but you still have to find a way to deal with it. \"Esply when a place SERVE DIM SUM FOR ALL DAY.\"    Anyway, we still like to go back and try again. Next time if the food is cold,... oh ya I'll talk to them about that problem..."}
{"text":"Had dim sum today 2/2/14.  Very good service today even though it was super busy.  All of the different food was good."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Vegas!!   I love that they have the traditional dim sum carts and are open all day! (Lunch is slightly cheaper than dinner pricing). My absolute favorite dish is SHRIMP NOODLE. It's so simple yet so fantastical! My other must haves are Shiu Mai, Har Gow, Beef Tripe, and Steamed BBQ buns. They have a big dining room with booths and tables and are great with accommodating large parties. =]"}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed with this place. It was pretty busy at 2pm for dim sum on a Tuesday though. Decent dim sum, I guess...  Most of the dim sum we had were already cold. I guess we were seated in the \"other\" room, and not the main dining area. Oh well! The only good thing I ate (and was WARM!) was the pineapple buns. They were pretty good. Theresa B. and me had to get another tray.  The total wasn't as bad as we thought. We had about 20 dim sum plates, and it cost us about $13 each for the 4 of us (including tip and tax).   I actually like Chang's a lot better than this..."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time with my in-laws on a whim. Being from NJ we almost never like any chinese food out here. Jalepenos in generel tsos chicken is a sin against good chinese food yet every chinese establishment on the west coast seems to find it appropriate. After living here for 6 years I've gotten used to it. This place exceeded my expectations. The dim sum was good. We got one bowl of wonton soup and it was big enough for the 4 of us. The entrees (i had kung pao chicken) were delicious, authentic, and nice portions. We have gone there for dine in and take out many times after this experience. It has become the only place we go for chinese. Now, if this place was compared to any chinese back home it would have just been so-so but its the best we've found out here so 5 stars for Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"OMG - I love me some dim sum and this is the place to go!  The place is big, has the ladies walking around with the serving carts offering tasty little dumplings or sweet treats like my favorite sesame balls and egg custard tarts, or you can order from the regular menu.  The siu mai (pork dumplings) are out of this world - packed with meat, black mushrooms and other good stuff, I can eat 4 or 6 of these by myself.  I loved the steamed cha siu bow (BBQ pork steamed bun) with its delicious sweet sauce.  I indulged in a sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves with ground pork and one delectable bite of Chinese sausage.  It's one of my \"comfort foods.\" Remarkably good service for a Chinese restaurant, too.   Oh, and one of the best things about this place is they are open from 10:30 am to 10:30 pm and they serve dim sum ALL DAY!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to come here on various occasions whenever I'd come to Vegas to visit relatives. The food was all right, but I just know that I've had better in the Rowland Heights area."}
{"text":"Serves dim sum all day, in the rolling carts. I come here once a week to get my fix. Never expect excellent customer service - I just come here for the food. Consistently have carts going around, and food is fresh and plenty. Lots of choices here. And there's virtually no wait to be seated. Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.  It was tasty and well prepared   Nothing wrong with any of the dishes we were served   3 stars for the service.  The staff was competent but a little slow on the draw   2 stars for the value.   Dinner for the two of us was 70 dollars which was too expensive for the dishes we ordered.  The dim sum is really over priced and the value is just not there.  I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Delicious food, questionable service. Food took a long time to come out. Servers were slow and unfriendly."}
{"text":"I come here almost every month when I crave for simple uncomplicated dimsum. No weird stuff. Every time I come, there is a wait but it's pretty fast. As soon as you get seated, the dimsum carts are soon to flock to your table with streaming little baskets! The dimsum is good but I think seeing every table ordering tons of those little baskets make me want to order everything. Very reasonable prices. Orders are at $3.50/ basket on the average. My personal faves are siomai and shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns (the best I've tried in Vegas), tendon, sharks fin. The sesame balls are really crisp fresh and well stuffed. The tofu desert with syrup is good but on the gingery side.  They also have a large carte menu but I never really bothered so I can't say comment on that.  Try not to come on an off time or not a busy time, the dimsum may not be as fresh.  The chairs and tables are on the sticky side and restroom smells a Lil funky."}
{"text":"Food is Five Star at this place. Went for dinner, and was delighted to have dim sum available. The carts came around often enough to provide nice choices.  Also ordered two dinner dishes. Sizzling platter beef and mushroom was very flavorful. The beef cubes were almost crispy (not breaded) on the outside yet absolutely tender and juicy on the inside.  The Stir Fried oyster in XO Sauce hit the spot. Just enough heat with the oysters fresh and tender. Well done, Orchids Garden."}
{"text":"Mediocre dim sum. Nothing surprised me. Nothing was delicious.  But nothing sucked as well. A lot of the food is greasy.   Pro: 24 hr dim sum  I would go back if the food and customer service improved"}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum place that I can find in Vegas so far. The place is very dated, decor wise. Not as glamorous as most dim sum houses in California. But the food is pretty good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Dim Sum = Yum Yum. Staff here are quite friendly. This is the first time I've been to a dim sum place like this where they walk around with food carts asking if you want something. This was a great experience for me and I'm glad this place became my first. Dim Sum here is yummy I love the shrimp dim sum, I'm not much of sho mai fan, but from the looks of everyone else that had it, it seemed like it was good. What I found to be very delicious was the shrimp wontons! Those were delicious. Now because of this place I'm going to hunt down a dim sum place in the Bay Area similar to this. There was more on the menu/food cart that we didn't try, but everything we did try was yummmmy!  When I come back I'll be sure to stop by here again."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  I think my ancestors would roll over in their graves to hear what this restaurant charges for a bowl of congee (rice porridge)!!!  $28 for a bowl of seafood congee!  AIYAH!  It's totally unheard of, I hope the seafood is made out of gold!  After having spent a week here in Vegas without having any asian food, I had a craving so I came here.  Looking at the prices, I thought this place must serve some stellar chinese food.  Well, it disappointed me.  While the staff was very friendly and a couple of the waiters even flirted with me (hehehe...), I just didn't think the food was all that great, especially one that prides itself on being a great chinese restaurant serving authentic Hong Kong style cuisine.  I got the seafood pan fried noodles which was $18 and then a serving of the roasted pork belly for $16.  The food was mediocre and very pricey.  It however, had a nice view of people on the gondolas at the Venetian.  The restaurant was pretty dead for it being a Friday night at the busy Venetian casino."}
{"text":"If you've ever read my reviews or know me in real life, you would know that I value consistency. And it's exactly this that saves Orchid Garden from all of its downfalls.  Weak tea and decent food. Sometimes the carts take forever to make it back to you but some carts seem to stop by every 5 minutes. It's always the ones we want that never seem to come around.  The service is pretty good though, and the hosts and cart ladies are always attentive and err on the friendly side, despite the fact that I am Chinese and cannot speak it (which is apparently a sin). Prices are also attractive, especially for a light lunch or for those who don't prefer to stuff themselves senseless.  Any dishes with noodles (such as the big fat ones with shrimp inside) are okay - not the softest but still satisfies my craving. Harkow and shumai is decent as well. I always like getting beef tendon, egg tarts, and this crispy fluffy taro bun.  I've never had to wait but the majority of tables in the wide-open eating space is occupied. Of course, my favorite aspect of Orchids is the consistency. Every time I've been there, I know what to expect and it's great for when I crave dim sum that won't hurt my wallet. Good location and ample parking as well."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good and I think I got food poisoning from this place. We only order 2 dishes 1 soup and 3 dim sum orders and it went up to $60 that is way overpriced. The food tasted horrible and some were too salty. The staff was rude and when we were seated we didn't get a menu for awhile. When we asked for menus they only gave us 1 menu for 4 people. I also never got a refill on my drink. The lady who took our order was yelling at us to order more when we said that's it. Where I'm from I can get better quality and quantity food."}
{"text":"It's slim pickings to find good quality and tasty dim sum here in LV. We came during a long holiday weekend and there were not enough food carts with dim sum dishes being circulated throughout restaurant to service the large crowds. The food was mediocre compared to dim sum you would find in the SF Bay Area. I would not return."}
{"text":"Worst. I mean, the ones in the cart is okay but those you order is not good at all we end up not eating the food. We ordered beef broccoli which is by the way veryyyyyy salty and the salt and pepper shrimp is too much oily."}
{"text":"Gr8 Chinese food in a lovely restaurant setting.  Favorable sauces, fresh ingredients and family-friendly.   Dim sum and traditional dishes w/a huge menu selection.  Good service but limited English.  Lots of parking and seating inside.  Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little far  from China town. I came here for yum cha. Its is very delicious w/ decent price but has too much MSG that my friend had major headache (he is allergy to MSG)."}
{"text":"My favorite all day dim sum! Service is fast, and servers are nice. Once you sit down the food carts will make their rounds, so no wait time, which is always great! Everything is so tasty!"}
{"text":"They do seem to have dim sum all day.  It was good.  Not spectacular, but what I'd call workmanlike dim sum.  Also, being well off the strip, it's easy to get to and easy to park.  I didn't get the feeling of being an unwelcome obstruction that some dim sum places exude.  It's a little hard to appreciate a dim sum place when you're there solo, so maybe they deserve another star.  Too bad there's no 3 1/2 rating...."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, pretty clean. The servers are kind of weird though. Pretty sure it was the language barrier because we asked for a refill of water but was told to refill it ourselves from another persons water cup. Strange, but funny. Every time we visit Las Vegas, we NEED to go to this place. They have one of the best dim sums I have ever tried. I overall recommend this dim sum place. It's amazing. Their shu mai, PEKING DUCK, red bean balls and almost everything is amazing. A must go for dim sum."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me. $130.00 for 4 adult and 2 child for Dim Sum. No thanks, never again will me and my family go here. Customer service sucks, portion sucks and and food just OK. Their are plenty of good Dim Sum in Vegas to pay for this."}
{"text":"We read the hit-and-miss reviews and weren't sure if it would be good, but I have figured it all out. The people that weren't happy with the food mostly said they had been going at odd hours. We went at primetime and had dim sum and everything was great. Super fresh. Best dim sum I have had. You have to go during meal times to get it fresh. I especially loved the soup dumpling, manapua, and shark fin dumpling."}
{"text":"This is my go to dim sum place. Usually, always great. They advertise \"all day dim sum\". We went there at around 7pm for dim sum. Waited 10 minutes and the 1st cart finally shows up, with 6 plates on it, 6 plates of the same item. Another 10 minutes till the next cart shows up, with 3 plates of Chinese broccoli. Another 10 minutes, some story different cart. And when we ask for a certain item, of course \"it's coming\".  After sitting there for an hour, a waitress finally notices and ask which items we wanted, she would get them for us. So we start with the basic, steam bbq pork buns. She responded \"oh so sorry, out till tomorrow\" next item we ask for siu nai, same response. Har gow same response. These are basic dim sum items, how are you going to advertise \"all day dim sum\" and not even have the basics."}
{"text":"In the past, I've always been here with my family because (to my knowledge) we didn't know of any other dimsum places, really. Well, it's been awhile since I went back (except recently) and of course, the service still lacks. I feel like the waitresses are always grumpy here. Can't even smile.  The dishes are good, to me, because I really like the noodles and the crispy shrimp, but those sure add up. I've already found a new dimsum place to go to now, but the service here is pretty depressing. I feel like I have to climb a mountain just to be noticed sometimes."}
{"text":"came on a sunday for dimsum about 11:30 and had a small wait maybe 5-10mins. but by the time we finished there was a pretty big crowd waiting for seating. the carts seemed to be speeding off somewhere and never wanting to stop at each table which i thought was really weird. i had to literally holler for them to stop. between 6 of us, we had maybe 17 dishes or so and the bill was 70 with tips! fairly reasonable. the tendon and chow fun was one of our faves. most of the other dishes were satisfying enough but lacked flavor that we have in NY."}
{"text":"Dim Sum:  - shrimp dumplings - radish cake  - shui mai  - beef ball  - beef rice noodle  - shrimp rice noodle  - steam pork ribs  - veggies   NONE OF THEM WAS GOOD ! Stay away from this place! The service was horrible too! I feel like I wasted my time, my money and my Calories intake here !"}
{"text":"Went for dim sum.  It was moderately busy, but the carts came around often.  The food was decent and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Another foray into the world of dim sum was at hand, and since Orchid Gardens was a place we've wanted to try for a long time, we decided to give it a try.  We came here for an early dinner, 4:30ish, so we figured we were either going to get the fresh stuff they began preparing for dinner, or the bottom-of-the-barrel leftover from the lunch crowd.  Well, either they continuously make them or we got the first dinner batch, because everything was fresh.    After the somewhat frustrating experience at Ping Pang Pong with not enough of what I wanted, I was not-so-secretly hoping the menu would be more to my liking.  I was not disappointed.  Plenty of shu mai, dumplings, and har gows to satisfy my cravings.  The pork and shrimp based pieces were fresh and tasty, with a couple of complaints;  1) the rice wrappings on the har gow and rice noodle rolls had too much flour-y taste to them, and 2) the rice noodle rolls had too much of the rice noodles for the amount of shrimp.  Not sure there should be flour taste in rice noodles...  But otherwise, the shu mais and dumplings were great, and the pimento stuffed with shrimp dim sum was fantastic.  And the sweet cream buns were yummy too.    Clean setting, fresh and mostly delish dim sums, and timeliness all add up to a satisfying experience.  Service is typically terse for dim sum joints, although there were spots of smiles and courtesy here and there.  We might also want to try some regular menus here, although I'm not sure how we'd resist the temptation of the rolling carts!  Table-for-1 Factor:  They also have regular Chinese menu here, but being that carts are rolling around all over and large groups abound, I don't know if you'd feel entirely comfortable sitting alone..."}
{"text":"Great, authentic dim sum at a good price. You can't really ask for more. This place was packed when I went there and I imagine it is always busy. However, we were seated within 5 minutes and started eating right away. I'll be back for many meals here!"}
{"text":"Ate here with high expectations, because it was recommended to us by someone. The selection wasn't great at all. Seems like they only had 4 different carts of dim sum and we were being offered the same thing over and over again."}
{"text":"\"Shout out to the Asian girls. Let the lights dim sum.\"  If you got a fancy for Chinese food and are extremely hungry definitely check this spot out.  I don't really have high expectations for Chinese restaurants so this one is no exception. I've ate here twice and left both times with a belly full of food.  I was never a fan of duck, but became one because of this place. I also need to add my love for shumai. If you don't have high expectations of a restaurant just give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for dim sum in a long time, now I remember why - mediocre, overpriced and this time we got the teeniest siu mai and har gow I've ever seen. Looking at other people pics, maybe the chef was feeling stingy today, but wtf.   Its one of the only places that has all day dim sum, so that's the only reason I ended up at orchid garden. I was also unpleasantly surprised that their shrimp won ton is $4.15 there - its listed on the menu, but guess they call it fried shrimp ball there? Or they overcharged since I'm not Chinese. Who knows, and regardless ill stick to my usual Cathay House from now."}
{"text":"This is our dim sum go to place in Vegas. We keep trying others in  town but this so far is the best. Soup dumpling are very good as long as you get them fresh so they are still juicy, shrimp or bbq pork rice noodles also very good. We also order off the menu but the dim sum is so good why fill up on other foodn. Try it!"}
{"text":"this place isnt bad but its not really good either. (food wise)  They have dim sum all day, and the prices are cheap so that is good.  But i won't come here again. Straight up."}
{"text":"So good...so so so good!  Be careful not to pick too many things from the carts...it adds up fast.  Five of us racked up $100 bill...so worth it...yummy!!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few dim sums, and I want to say that my faves are usually based on taste, price, and service. This place does the job, but it's not my first choice.   We came in a group of 8, so I got to try a lot of different items. I was a bit disappointed that the radish cakes didn't come out hot and freshly fried. Some of he dishes had been microwaved, and even had Saran Wrap over the plate, which they removed only after you pick it.   The wait was only 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11am, so I think that's pretty good. I'm not sure if there was a standout item for me. Oh, the chives dumplings that are round and flat were my favorite.   Food comes out quick. We were bunch of fatties with eyes bigger than our stomach, so by the end, htere was enough leftover to create a combo dim sum meal for dinner.   The price came out to $28/pp after tax and tip. I believe gratuity was included as we were a party of 8. Never seen a $240 bill at dim sum before, but there's always a first for everything.   Good note: this place has dim sum ALL DAY"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and am finally rating this restaurant for Dim Sum only.  This is where I get my Dim Sum fix. You can't go wrong (unless it's not fresh) with Shu Mai, mushroom Shu Mai, Shrimp & Spinach, Shark Fin dumpling, sticky ric and more!  When you eat enough Dim Sum, you can generally tell if it is fresh due to its appearance. Most items here are fresh but once in a while I will want something that has obviously been sitting on the cart too long.  In that case, ignore it and get something else or ask them to make it fresh.  Usually busy restaurant that becomes an incredibly busy restaurant during holidays and Chinese New Years.  Eat Dim Sum. Be happy! Make someone's day!"}
{"text":"This spot is one of my favortie places for dim sum. Their selection of dim sum is very big, the quality of the dim sum is very fresh and delicious. Serivce is quick and attentive. The ladies with the dim sum carts hustle hard and flow freely throughout the huge restaurant always ready to give you what you need. Prices are reasonable and well worth it. The wait to be seated (if not pack'd) is not long at all. On Sundays, its a must to get their early by 11am if not the place fills up and the wait for a seat begins. Try it out if you come to Las Vegas. The only place that serves dim sum everyday, all day."}
{"text":"Orchids rates a solid 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up to 4 just because I thought it was slightly better than A-ok.    They open for 10:30 and we got there at 10:25.  It was awesome to be one of the first inside.  The dining room is quite large and it filled up quickly.    Selections came out in abundance and we were able to grab everything we were craving.  All the usual suspects were involved (shu mai, har gow, fried meat dumpling, sticky rice, pork buns, etc.), but the best thing was the price.  We ate a TON and left with a $44 bill which included the tip.  Not too shabby for a party of 4.    Love this place and would definitely go back again next time I'm in town and feel like dining off the strip."}
{"text":"It's all about timing with this place apparently ... some dishes are more plentiful in certain times of the day, I'm guessing, because by the time the noodles and fried shrimp balls and shu mai showed up, my family and I were already full with the dishes we settled for when our normal faves weren't on hand. But overall, it's a pretty decent all-day dim sum. Faves were BBQ pork steamed bun and chicken wings and the calamari. Noodles and shu mai were also a hit once we finally got em. Hargow was okay."}
{"text":"Dim sum ALL DAY! Orchid Gardens is always my stand-by Dim Sum spot. The atmosphere is friendly, the food is great , and the bathrooms are clean! Plus...I'll just say it again...dim sum ALL DAY!  Growing up in SoCal, I can't say it's on the level of NBC in Monterey Park or ABC in Chinatown in Downtown L.A., but for Vegas, it's not half bad & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went here with family.  Very busy restaurant, the food was decent, nothing special. Customer service was ok, some were rude. Pineapple buns are bomb! The parking sucked."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 people for dim sum. We were the first people here and they seated us horribly. The carts of dim sum was neglecting my half of the restaurant and I waited 30 mins and we only got 7 plates. The carts would either go right past us or they would completely dodge our direction. And when my friend kept trying to wave them down, they would not look! SO DISRESPECTFUL! We even informed our waitress and they by passed us again. That was the last straw and we left. This is my first time where I never tipped. My group was extremely pissed off. This place needs to GET IT TOGETHER ."}
{"text":"My parents have dim sum here on a regular basis and besides the hit or miss service, the food and selection is pretty good.  If you don't see what you want on the cart, just ask for it and one of the ladies can help you out.  We usually eat:  char siu baos (steamed for me, baked for my dad), har gow, siu mai, XO mein, stuffed peppers, chicken feet for my parents, egg tartlettes and others.  The dan tat/egg tarts have gotten really small.  Before, they used to be around 3 inches in size, now, they're just bite sized.  Everything else was fresh from the kitchen and before we knew it, we were really stuffed.  The key here is to get there before noon, preferably between 11 and 1130 to beat the crowds and avoid the wait."}
{"text":"As usual, this place serves quality dim-sum and at a great price. Personally, there are only two decent dim sum restaurants in town and this is one. Overall, the food is great, service is on par and the prices fair. Some of my personal favorite dishes include the calamari, shrimp noodle and sesame bun with red bean.... Yumm..... Actually just typing that makes me want to go back.   With regards to dim sum, I can only speak with regards to lunch. And yes... I will be back again, again and again. Good times Orchid Garden!"}
{"text":"Orchids Garden is located in Las Vegas's China Town. It has a nice, large parking lot. Our party of 6 went for lunch around 1pm and dim sum carts were still in full effect.  You will find all the traditional Cantonese Dim Sum classics: har gow, siu mai, hum bao...aka shrimp balls, pork meatball, bbq pork bun. Everything you would expect to see at an old school Cantonese dim sum service - my favourites are stuffed eggplant and hom sui gok (\"footballs\"). The steam cart items could have been hotter, but I didn't think it was bad...  Orchids Garden is old school on several levels - you won't find carts very often in Vancouver BC, for instance, because they're serving HK or Taiwanese style - which is ordering on a menu. Also, the preparations are akin to old school diner classics. It is not \"elevated\". But it is oh-so-comforting. I really enjoyed it - it reminded me of dim sum with my grandparents.  Prices are on-point for this type of establishment - compared to Seattle, Vancouver BC and San Francisco. The dumplings are very standard sized. Our party of 6 massively over-ate and spent just under $100. That's A LOT of dim sum....literally my kids went through 6 orders of shrimp balls alone...so..."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry it's good to grab a quick bite but the quality is lacking however it is really cheap. Their steamed lotus bean and steamed yellow custard buns were inedible, I threw them out, their egg tart shells are way too salty, threw them out as well. They did not have any beef cheung fun on Monday which was utterly disappointing. Their beef balls were excellent though and their BBQ buns ok, though a bit fatty. Their lo mei gai rice wrapped in lotus lee was very good. Bathrooms are actually really nice and modern which was a real surprise. Glad they serve dim sum all day long as I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Seriously, every time my boyfriend and I are hungry on Sahara, Orchid Gardens is our go to place. I don't know why more people give this place five stars. We always end up eating more than our fill on delicious dim sum and our bill has never been more than $29. Good food, good variety, and good prices."}
{"text":"2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 058/100  Solid dim sum restaurant in Vegas!  My boyfriend wanted to get dim sum while we in Vegas, so we did a little Yelping and found this to be one of the better places in the area. NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.  We came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!  I love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes.   This place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:  ha/har gow siu mai wu gok cha siu bao (baked + steamed) cheong fan lo baak gou fung zao daan taat jin deui do fu fa lai wong bau  We got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there!   I also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!  Overall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is better than the other dim sum houses I've been to in LV, and probably a bit more expensive too - but the service can be a bit hurried and difficult to get the specific dimsum dishes you want, especially because the restaurant is so busy. I love that I can get dim sum all day and that's why we'll keep coming back.   Going right at opening, 10:30 on Saturday morning, was great so we could beat the rush and be seated right away. We also ordered a 1/2 duck which was pretty typical and good; the sweet ginger tofu dessert is really good here!"}
{"text":"This is one of our two dim sum restaurant of choice in Las Vegas.  The price is inexpensive for dim sum, and conveniently located for students attending classes at CSN's Cheyenne and Charleston campuses.  We usually only go to dim sum between 11am-1pm, so have not encountered issues with dim sum being cold. The food we typically order are usually served hot or warm, unless it is supposed to be served cold.  The variety of selection is comparable to most other dim sum restaurants.  The quality is average, nothing that blows away your expectations, and is a good value for the menu pricing.  Is it the best quality dim sum available in Las Vegas?  No. Is it good dim sum for the price?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Having done dim sum at many different spots around time, I am surprised it has taken me this long to give Orchids Garden a chance.   They serve dim sum all day. The carts come around and it was relatively busy. Obliviously, it s better for freshness if they are pretty busy so the food can be replenished often. Most of the items we tried were decent. Obviously some had been sitting on the carts a little longer than was optimal.   I can't say any one item was a standout but for the price it was good and filling. I'd be interested in giving them another go during a busy weekend morning to see how they hold up."}
{"text":"I came here for dimsum. My friend loves this place so I tried... 3 times. I want to like this place but quality is just not there. Oil tasted stale, steam are ok. I will not go back again, or recommend. I am done!"}
{"text":"Fast, and tasty! I bit pricey...dim sum for two usually gets me to $65+, but it's to satisfying, you won't notice. They carts come and go...they always have what you want and if they don't, they order it fresh. My go to dim sum place for Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good value. The ladies with the Dim Sum carts could be a tad nicer.  Lost a star for the hospitality. Not recommend for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I have been here for dim sum a few times and it is OK.  There was nothing that really ever stood out, positively or negatively, but sometimes dim sum is just calling my name, and this is where we go.    However, yesterday my family came to try the peking duck.  The last time I had peking duck was in Hong Kong, where the sizzling duck was carved at table side and the skin was perfectly crispy.  It was like candy.  Unfortunately, my experience at Orchids Garden was not on par.  Parts of the skin were still attached to the duck meat and only half of the pieces were crispy, while the others were limp and chewy.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy, although a little thicker than I prefer.  But, the addition of the plum sauce and the spring onions made me forget the disappointing duck skin.   I probably won't order it again, hence the search for delicious Peking Duck in Las Vegas continues.  This restaurant is quite clean, though.  Service is friendly, and where else can you get dim sum all day? So, I will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum in Vegas, good prices and friendly service, can't beat dim sum all day!"}
{"text":"I gauge my ratings based on if I'd come back to an establishment or not. 1 star = HELL NO. 2 stars = No, thanks. 3 stars = maybe?. 4 stars = YEP. 5 stars = HELL YEAH! I give this dim sum place a 4 star, and I'd gladly come back when I'm on my usual visit to Vegas.  One of the better dim sum places I've been to; the only better ones are in the bay area. Service is usually mediocre at all dim sum places, but this one was better than others.  The food quality was great; it has everything that a usual dim sum place has.  I was also happy that they had thai tea, which tasted great.  Overall, I was content with the price and quality I received.  Good job, Orchids Garden.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Having only lived a year in Las Vegas, I often drive by Orchids Garden Restaurant.  When my husband said he wanted Chinese, we decided to give it a try. The employees were nice enough, however, we were not asked if this was our first time dining there.  We were unaware of the two choices they have 1) off the regular menu or 2) off the \"rolling cart\" menu.  We were a bit confused, so we decided to do the \"rolling cart\" menu.  It was challenging understanding the woman offering us the menu choices.  There is a menu that has pictures, but a lot of the menu items looked the same.   Overall, the food was absolutely NASTY.  It was old and greasy.  The calamari was cold, so we sent it back.  All they did was throw it back in the fryer.  So now it was hot but overcooked.  My husband, who always tries to find something positive, did like the Fried Rice.  It was very greasy.   When I woke at 2:30 am with a very queasy stomach, I realized it was from thinking about the food I had eaten at the Orchids Garden.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  Still looking for a decent Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for an early lunch with a friend today. It was not packed at all and we were seated right away. It took just a few minutes for them to ask us what we wanted to drink and bring us some utensils to use for our food.   We were sat where not a lot of people were at first so the dim sum carts passed us by a few times before actually coming to us. I can't remember the first thing we got because the lady said it in Chinese and kinda looked at us and expected us to know what it was. All I got from what she said was shrimp and wonton so we got one of those and two shumai baskets. We also later got noodles and Chinese broccoli. We thought the shrimp was delicious so choose to actually get another one of those and even had a few left overs in the end.   Overall, everything was tasty. It did take quite some time for someone to come back in the end to check on us so we could get a box and the check though. Our experience was good and the restaurant was clean and has an Asian theme to it."}
