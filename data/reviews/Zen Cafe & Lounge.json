{"text":"Friday night and nowhere really to go until I remembered this new place opened up at Richlane Mall on Leslie St, just north of 16th ave.  Awesome environment, really good drinks and great jazz music in the background. A good place to catch up with friends or just relax. Love the lighting too. Reasonable prices for drinks too. Didn't try the snacks, however.  Must reserve next time to get a table upstairs though!  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Nice renovation. Nice deco. Great people. I like the blue decor overall speaking. And last but not least, the dessert is great! Better than a lot of other places I've been to."}
{"text":"I been here two times with my bestie. It was not that good. The first time we went, I got a iced white chocolate and it tasted like milk with sugar but I also got the fried octopus and it was pretty good. The second time we came we both got a cake and I got a green tea latte and she got the caramel one. The cake was amazing but the green tea didn't taste that good. The caramel one was ok. Like the iced white chocolate it just tasted like milk but no sugar and it was very grainy which I didn't like. But I'll be back for the delicious cake!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and delicious yet pretty macaroons!  Compared to some of the macaroons I've had in the past, the ones I had at ZeN were the least bit coconut-y which I enjoyed. I don't particularly enjoy the strong coconut flavour of a macaroon.  I had a chance to speak to one of the managers or owner there and she explained how the macaroons they make have no artificial flavours and made of real fruit juice!  The interior of the cafe is superb! Very very nicely decorated. The couches are also super comfy.  ZeN is a great place to relax and enjoy some chitchat with friends."}
{"text":"It used to one of fav places but not anymore.. we came here hoping to have some good food for the long weekend, yet very disappointed! We ordered two sets, pizza & pastries set.. it came with soup, which we suspected that it's Campbell's cream soup, as we saw those instant soup residue inside the bowl! :( Service is bad, or I should say no service at all as nobody came over until we repeatedly wave n asked.. coffee is nothing special..  won't be returning.."}
{"text":"It is a nice surprise to find an uptown cafe serving cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.  The cafe has modern decor, seating is spacious and comfortable and services were excellent.  The staff was very patient and friendly, she has introduced the types of cakes available and provided good suggestions.  I tried the Hazelnut latte, pumpkin cheesecake and ham & cheese sandwich.  Both food and drink are  good quality.  Love the latte art with the drink. High tea set is available with reservation in advance, will try it next time."}
{"text":"I actually love love love this place. First of all, this cafe has such a beautiful atmosphere and comfortable seating. Second, their macaroons are so good that you'll probably try them all the first time. Prices are fair, aren't expensive at all. Their cheese cake and latte are delicious as well. I've seen amazing pictures of their Japanese food and bread so I'll definitely go more often to try them!"}
{"text":"terrible lunch package, food is no good at all, they need to change chef, that is a must"}
{"text":"Have visited the place several times already - I'm not someone that frequently reviews, but this place has great drink selection (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) including some very nice organic options which is a great bonus. The self-playing piano is a nice touch - they do have live music occasionally as well which provides a great atmosphere. The variety of snack and dessert options are delicious as well - fried oysters are my personal favourite. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$8 min charge per person on weekends and wouldn't let us sit at a table even though the places was empty. My friend and I ordered $7.75 worth per person since we didn't really want to eat much (2 drinks and shared a cake) and they said we didn't meet the minimum charge and urged us (aggressively) to purchase some macarons or something else since we weren't hungry.   We ended up just paying $8 instead, probably would not come back. Drinks were okay (soy rooibas latte) but wasn't something you couldn't get somewhere else. Might come back to hang out with friends on a weekday when they don't have the minimum charge.   Crepe cake was nothing special, was very dense and had lots of cream. Would not suggest to order that cake!"}
{"text":"Ordered the freshly baked pizza n i saw the waitress took the pizza out from the frozen pizza box n put put it into the oven...my mom ordered the seafood pasta ($18's)  which doesn't taste good at all, for this price i would expect something way better than this My mom n i didn't stay there for long, but the waiter came over 3 times to ask do we wanna order any coffee or tea..."}
{"text":"Newish cafe inside Richlane plaza ???. A modern designed cafe serving gelatos, cakes, macaroons, specialty coffees, teas and snacks. They have afternoon tea specials ??? which includes a drink and a snack or pastry at different prices and selection.   They have two floors but upstairs are reserved for parties and with a higher minimum charge per person. Typically it is $8 minimum charge a person so a drink and a food item would cover it. I uploaded pictures of their menu and their pieces.   Macaroons are best served at room temperature so if they deliver them (which they are $2.75 a piece) let them sit a bit before devouring them.   Their matcha latte lacks the matcha taste though. Caramel latte is bit too sweet.   They offer Cheesecake Factory pieces which are delicious if ou haven't been to the restaurants in the states yourself.   They open till past midnight so if you want to enjoy some cafe style items late at night and don't want bubble tea or beers, come try this place out.  They're bathrooms are quite clean too."}
{"text":"Good spot for some coffee, tea and desert. Didn't even know this place existed until I saw it on Yelp.   We actually missed it when we got into the plaza because there was no sign. The place is not big but it very comfortable.  I was there on a Sunday late afternoon so it wasn't busy at all.  The seats were big and comfy and decor was very modern.  There was music playing in the background. I ordered a cafe mocha and it was delicious.  They also had a selection of organic teas to choose from.  Servers were friendly and attentive.  I'll have to go back to check out their deserts."}
{"text":"Very nice environment to listen to some jazz and take a rest. Also a great choice to spend some quality time with friends.  Very high quality coffee and tea (organic) paired with certified organic honey crystal instead of raw sugar.  They do serve house red and white wine or cocktails.  Unique cartoon macaron and signature cakes.  I've only tried the macaron and not too sweet at all.  Comparable price as other places that sell macaron.   Have to come back and try their sandwiches and cakes :)"}
{"text":"I love the live music aspect - that really sold me as a customer, considering the artist was a great singer and guitarist! His energy was especially friendly and the crowd was loving his vibe, despite it being fairly dead lol.   The cakes were okay, I do wish they had more choices, or maybe switched vendors to Dufflet and La Rocca if anything.  Do expect to shout from time to time due to loud ambiance."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and his family. His family was returning back to Ottawa, where they don't have many good choices for food. When we first walked in, it smelled fragrant and the atmosphere was very classy. They played some relaxing jazz. All of the tables sit up to 5 people, so the waitress was a little hesitant to sit a family at two leather sofas. The sofas were very comfortable, and not sunken in like some other restaurants. There weren't any cartoon macarons when we went, so I was a little disappointed I couldn't order a Hello Kitty macaron for the little one. She would have loved it. The service was great -- the waitress was very polite and friendly. She also explained everything on the menu clearly.   We ordered Hazelnut Latte (special fall selection), Matcha Latte, Blackout Cake, Godiva Double Chocolate Cheesecake, and Mango Mousse. The cheesecakes were from The Cheesecake Factory. The presentation of the Hazelnut Latte wasn't too fancy -- so I didn't bother to take a picture of it. I, unfortunately, did not get to try it. The Matcha Latte had a bit of some matcha powder sprinkled on top. The matcha latte tasted good, but I would have preferred a bit more matcha flavour. Overall very smooth though! We all enjoyed all of the cakes, some of us preferring one over the other."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and we were in the mood for some late night desserts and sweets.  Yelp guided us to this location based on our search filtered by the \"late night\" option provided from this website.  The yelp description told us that this location closes at 2a.m., we arrived here and noticed an empty parking lot (we found out it was located inside a small plaza).  We ventured on to the plaza, only to our disappointment, found out that this restaurant was already closed and had completely different hours as stated on yelp.  We weren't happy, wasted time and gas. Not sure who is to blame, yelp? or lack of update from owner on yelp, either way, was not satisfied.  Posted pics of their \"new\" hours just in-case anybody wishes to visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and love the live music. Went on a Saturday evening around 10:30pm with a few friends. I love that there are quite a few items that are organic - coffee, wine, tea. I had an organic smoothie, but it was more like a slushie or juice with crushed ice, there was just too much ice in it. My husband had one of the organic red wines, it wasn't bad. Our friends ordered lattes and tea. I wanted to get the Lady M cake but it wasn't available, I think they only come in once a week? It's a good place to relax. The staff was very friendly, but they never brought our waters, and the service was a bit slow, but I would still recommend this cafe and would definitely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Cozy, very quiet and very friendly staff. I went in the late evening on Friday and it was practically empty but I kind of enjoyed it that way. Interior is clean and atmosphere is very relaxing. Customers are allowed to use their vapors but of course the staff went around to ask other customers first to see if it is alright for peopel to vape in there. Location wise, it was a bit hard to find. There are no signs outside the building and once you're in its hard to find it. The cheesecake was fresh, moist and delicious and I really enjoyed their fruit smooties as well as their matcha latte. They are not stingy with the flavouring and you can strongly taste the matcha flavour which I like. I think the seating is a little tight and would be great for a small group of 3-4 people per table other than that I will.definitley come back again."}
{"text":"So, went here for the second time over the weekend, and was sadly told that there was an $8 minimum charge per person on the weekends. Last time I was here, it was just a beverage per person, but now its $8.  This amount is funny, as you need to basically order 1.5-2 items on their menu to fulfill this requirement. As a person that isn't crazy about cakes and sweets, it makes the decisions tougher. Any drinks they have are $3-5 and food/snacks are anywhere between $5-7.99.  I really enjoyed their teas last time, and wanted to return for just that, but ended up having to order more than what I wanted to. Cakes are still good though (as per my last review).   So unless you have the appetite or the money, I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends (Fri, Sat, Sun) anymore. Best deal in my opinion is the tea time special from 2:30-5:00pm."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre for its price. We had informed the waiter that we wanted the combo, and she had instructed me \"snacks\" were in the page yet when we got the bill it wasn't within the combo. Drinks were alright. The environment was pretty nice, aesthetically pleasing and they played very chill music. I most likely not come back or recommend this place, because of price and quality of food."}
{"text":"Having a great time with my friend at this cafe. The Original Lady M taste so good, just like the one I ate in LA. I love to come here at weekend."}
{"text":"I have been here before for their cheese cakes, Lady M cakes and tea selection, and they were alright. Although you could tell that the cakes were definitely frozen before hand and not fully defrosted before serving. They offer an afternoon tea set for 2 and i called to make a reservation for a Sunday afternoon for 1:30pm and they confirmed on the phone that it was set. They said they opened at 12 pm on Sundays, it even says that outside their store. When I arrived at 1:15pm they were NOT opened...waited until 2 pm and even called several times but no one picked up or had the decency to call back. So I went for lunch at Dickens cafe a few stores down, after at around 3:15pm I walked by their store again and they were finally opened. This is not the way to run a business. If you cannot honour the business hours you set up or the reservations made then what kind of customer service are you trying to provide here? At least call the customer back and let them know that you are opening later than expected or call them back and apologize for wasting their time."}
{"text":"An offer of 5% from Yelp brought us in tonight.  I really like the menu and here offers a variety of tea, coffee and alcoholic selections.  Service is quite attentive. Our server is very proactive and politely keep smiling all the time.    We enjoyed the vibe here and service here.    I tried the Zen signature cafe latte and my partner ordered a scotch and my good friend ordered green tea latte.  It is quite a fulfilling big cup of latte.   Tastes nice and fresh.  Too bad tonight we didn't order any sweets or desserts.  Surely, we will be back for food items.   Overall, it deserves 4 stars including good service, store cleanliness and drink quality and taste experience.   The amazing part was that the server went extra miles to show us the upstairs knowing that we are the first time customers :)  great experience and nice atmosphere cafe/lounge in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I hosted a party for a group of girls in their party room and have the following to share:  Space, Ambience & Decor: Since the party we were hosting was Oscars themed, the decor worked out perfectly and I saved on some expenses in preparation for the party.  I definitely loved the amount of space that was available for 13 girls and everybody seemed to have loved it!  One down side is that the room got a bit stuffy and there really wasn't much the staff could do about it (even their little dyson fan couldn't help much).  Food: With a big party, I placed bulk orders on scones, croissants, cookies, macarons , yam fries, and popcorn chicken.  For beverages I ordered two pots of tea, juice and flavoured water (all non-alcoholic). Their macarons (jasmine, matcha and raspberry flavoured) are all made of organic ingredients and are different from the typical norm. I didn't quite get the chance to taste test all the macarons that were available, but I was told that the matcha with red bean filling and jasmine with raspberry filling (I can't remember what the last one had) were superb.  Their macarons were definitely, by far, the highlight of yummy treats from Zen. On the down side, I was rather disappointed with the inconsistency and quality of their baked goods.  The croissants, cookies and scones were obviously overvalued.  I hate to say this, but I was able to smell that they were slightly burnt (but there was no time left before the party to have have staff redo all the snacks) and unfortunately, they tasted pretty hard.  The croissants were not soft nor flaky, the cookies needed a bit of time to chew through, and scones were definitely brown and not \"golden.\"  While the staff was very nice about explaining what happened and was receptive to my feedback, the answer that I got was that they the temperature of the oven was higher than normal and the goods were left in there for too long.  As a baker myself, I understand this stuff happens in the kitchen all the time, but as a business, they need to be more careful and consistent to keep their customers.  In conclusion, go with the macarons and don't count on the baked goods if you need to put in a bulk order...  Price Point: Honestly speaking, I was really more focused on looking for a nice venue with good decor to host the party (which Zen was able to deliver in this case!).  I was willing to pay to have food prepared for convenience (check!) and to save a headache of doing all of it on my own.  However, with the inconsistency and quality of food, and how every extra food item added to the bill equated to a very nice price tag on the cost, taxes and gratuities, this will be probably be the only time that I'll host a party at Zen. (The prices charged on different items are still beyond my understanding...for example a 1L carafe of orange juice was $20?)  All in all, I have a mixed bag of feelings about Zen. Decor and ambience was great, staff were friendly (they threw in 3 free carafes of juice for the party/occasion...yay!) , but the price I paid for the inconsistency of food prepared steers me from going back again.  Sorry, Zen...  In summary... - Go for the macarons! - host a party only if you have the budget (be careful as food items can cost a pretty dime) and be wary of baked goods as they haven't quite figured out the temperament of their beloved oven yet (it needs some taming, perhaps?)"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to enter Zen Café & Lounge to try their mille crepe cakes out.  It was a Friday night and it turned out that they have live music every Friday and Saturday night.  Walking in, it felt like we were in the Christmas season again.  They still had many of their Christmas decorations and trees out.  It was dimly lit with the two musicians playing really nice music at the front of the café.  There were other customers inside too enjoying some drinks, snacks, and the live music.  It's hard to describe the mood and atmosphere but it was an absolutely wonderful and intimate evening.  The music wasn't too loud so we were still able to hear each other and enjoy each other's company.  We ordered the combo for one that included a drink and a mini cheesecake.  The mini cheesecake was incredibly cute and miniature.  It was a really rich and dense chocolate cheesecake that I really liked."}
{"text":"Great cafe and good service. Ordered a a hot gin cocktail which wasn't on the menu and the bartender made one. Its a small and quite space, has a modern design and comfy couches. didn't order food but the cake was good. I will come back to try the food."}
{"text":"Calm and modern atmosphere.   Tried the Godiva Cheesecake factory cheesecake.  Yum! Friendly staff. Would visit again.  The cafe is usually very quiet.  I think they should open their doors during open hours.  A few times when I walked by, even though I wanted to check it out, but because the doors were closed, I turned away."}
{"text":"They have wifi but not willing to give you the password...seats are not comfortable...we have four...they don't let us have the sofa seat because don't have 6 people...but then let other 4 people that came after us take the sofa seat..."}
{"text":"This place has very bad service. Servers have no idea what dessert selections are available, even though there are very few items on the menu.  They did not serve guests even after 10 minutes of sitting down, since they were busy chatting with each other so we had to get up and ask for service. Almost everything was sold out when though we had just called to ask what was available, and they said everything on the menu was available. Would not recommend at all. In-house food and drinks were not very good. The matcha latte wasnt very good, as well as the pudding called \"yogurt plant\". This yogurt plant was basically just sour unsweetened yogurt and frozen strawberries. The only edible thing was from NY cheesecake because it was from The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We came for dinner and we had pasta which was quite good BUT \"where is the meat\"???   They definitely need to put a bit more meat in their meals if they are to be remotely competitive in Richlane.  We went on a Friday night and we were the only dinner table.  Seating, service and the environment is great.    This may be a good dessert or afternoon tea place based on some of the other reviews.   But dinner is not the go to place (hopefully they make good changes later since I do like the environment)."}
{"text":"I like the decor and cheesecakes serving here, nice environment as well. If you want some nice afternoon time, here is a good choice. Will return for more cheesecakes :P"}
{"text":"I heard some great things about this place before I came; they make amazingly decorated character macarons and when I saw the four teenage mutant ninja turtle macarons on my friend's instagram .. I WAS SOLD.  I came into richlane mall cautiously (because apparently the restaurant at the end is haunted and people see dead girls in the female bathroom- yeah, I don't know.. confirmation of this, anyone?) But I found zen right away, and I was blown away by how nice the decor is! It's dark, mysteriously crisp and super clean. The seats were high, cushiony and super comfortable. The woman working was super nice and welcomed us right away. Apparently the macarons are not a permanent thing- they get shipped in and they get sold out QUICK! The woman said the TMNT macarons may not come again.... boooo :( I didn't want to try the other macarons just because they're just plain and I didn't come here for that. But then she told me the cheesecakes they receive come from the cheesecake factory? So my boyfriend and I took a seat and we ended up trying a slice. It was a small portion but it was really creamy and fruity at the same time. I enjoyed it, but it definitely was questionable- cheesecake factory is my life, and I'm pretty sure I'd recognize a slice of cake from there. The cheesecake sold there are sold in huge portions and they're a lot cheaper than here. (I understand, import fees and all that.. but.. still)   In the end, we ended up paying just under $10 (including tip) for a measly slice of cheesecake... worth it? Eh, maybe. Would I do it again? Probably not. I'm down to go back when they have character macarons though!! (One more thing.. the woman kept trying to tell me to follow their instagram because that's the /only/ way I'd know when their cute macarons shipped in)"}
{"text":"Food is great here. But the minimum spending rules is bs and the food here is extremely over priced. Go somewhere else to have your dessert."}
{"text":"its my second time here and my experience was as good as the first  super comfy couches, soft background music, modern design... really nice place to catch up w/ friends   and thumbs up for the waitresses here  my friend and I stayed over 5 hrs w/ only two orders of drinks + a cake  yet they didn't rush us & had a smile on the entire time  also, they kept coming by to refill our water  in terms of food, the cakes are from LaRocca so it was pretty standard  and I recommend the green tea frap over the hot matcha latte"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Worst of the worse.  If I can give this place 0 stars, I'd do it in a heart beat. I came here with my family, with the intention of having high tea with them. The price was only $19.99 + tax for 2 people. According to the menu, high tea comes with a pot of tea, mousse cake, 2 sandwiches and 2 pastries. We tried ordering high tea, but they ran out of mousse cake and said we'd have to pay an extra $5 to substitute the non-existent mousse cake with a cheesecake. That should've been our first warning that our experience would go downhill from there. Since no one in my family likes cheesecake, we opt out of high tea and decided to stick with the regular menu. After deciding what we wanted to eat, we flagged a waiter for service, and he probably arrived at our table 10 minutes later. We tried ordering some almond croissants, but he said they were sold out.... He walked away and gave some more time for us to think. My family and I then decided to get scones, so we called over for some service. Guess what? They were sold out AGAIN. So it looked like we had no choice but to get a cheesecake. After looking over the menu, we decided what cheesecake to get, and flagged the same server over...... and the cheesecake we wanted was SOLD OUT. How can you run a business when everything was sold out?? He did mention the cheesecakes they have available were plain, blueberry, raspberry and chocolate. I decided to go with the raspberry. After 10 minutes of waiting, a sad looking cheesecake got delivered to our table that strongly resembled blueberry cheesecake. How can you not believe it's blueberry, when the cheesecake has lavender marbling and a single dried out blueberry sitting on the dollop of whipped cream. I called over the server and questioned her, who insists it's raspberry and not blueberry. Well, I checked some pictures on Yelp, and the raspberry cheesecake looked nothing like the cheesecake I got!!!! The yelp picture verified I got a blueberry cheesecake and NOT the raspberry cheesecake I specifically asked for. If you're sold out of raspberry cheesecakes,  just admit it!!! No reason to be dishonest, even though  they ran out of 5 items I wanted from the menu. A business shouldn't be out of that many things & shouldn't be lying about something they don't have. It's a total misconduct of a business.  My mother was also complaining about the 2 for $5 bubble tea special. She wasn't able to get any tapioca up her straw. It turns out the tapiocas were stuck together in a single clump. Not cool... My father ordered a special sandwich under the happy hour menu. Nothing special about it,except you get a lot of lettuce and cabbage for $7.99.  Lastly, there was miscommunication about the Yelp check in system.  When you check in to this business you get 5% off the regular menu (excluding the specials). I asked the girl if I can get the bubble tea special and 5% off everything from the regular menu, which is 2 separate bills. She kindly obliged, but it turned out she didn't understand my question and priced the bubble tea at regular price gave me 5% discount off my entire bill. Why was I not surprised? I decided to pay with credit card, and was mortified with the tipping option on the machine. First option was 25% tip and second option was 20%.... even fine dining/upscale places are not that gutsy with tipping options, and service is typically top notch and very attentive. This place can not compare, and they expect a big tip from you."}
{"text":"If I can rate this zero! The service is horrible n very worse experience...3 waitress standing there chating with one of the waiter there; me n my frd sit for more than an hr. No one check us how's the drinks, wine n macarons ! First the house red wine is served freeze cold wrong temp at all. The house wine taste like sitting there more than weeks. Then cuz the air con was turn on , one flies in my wine. Waitress didn't say sorry or anything just say is the air con. I WILL NEVER COME AGAIN N NOW I KNOW WHY IS SO EMPTY INSIDE NOW!!"}
{"text":"Its always quiet and empty whenever I pass by and I pass by quite often because I grab food inside the same plaza.  I've never actually sat inside because there's nothing on the menu that's really interesting. Only thing I've tried is their cartoon macroons and its almost the worse I've tasted. Its considered quite expensive for a piece of sugar that only looks good. It does look cute but better to see than eat but totally not worth it!  There were nobody inside the place when I placed the take out order and yet I had to wait over 10mins for them to get me 4PCs of macroon from the display case.  Would not recommend anyone to go here and please their sweets are only for your eyes, not your mouth!"}
{"text":"Horrible drinks. The drink I ordered was the earl grey bubble tea, it was way too creamy with no sweetness to it (tasted like milk). The tapioca sucked. They're no better at bubble tea than Chinese super market's bubble tea that sell for 2 dollars. I would not order their bubble tea again.  On another note they had cheesecake that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Thanks, fellow Yelpers. Never would have known this place exists unless I saw the reviews. Zen Cafe & Lounge did not disappoint. I took my daughter there for tea. Beautiful atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and a wide variety of teas and desserts to choose from. The ricotta cheese cake was heavenly. Kind of hidden away. In a better location, this place would be super busy all the time. I will spread the word. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - On Saturdays, they allow vaping so just a FYI. Ordered the red velvet cheesecake and the mango crepe. Both were delicious. The matcha latte wasnt very good. But I am not the type to complain. The woman behind me also ordered the match latte and complained about it several times. I felt bad for the worker who had to deal with that. But to be honest, yea, it tasted very bitter and blah.  Decor is very nice. Looks like a lounge but its very small overall. There is an upstairs but I guess its just for big events.  I was surprised there was a worker who looked to be like 12  years old or less. I have no idea how that all works but I felt bad for her. She did provide outstanding service however!  The 3.5 stars reflect the decor, great service, but also that the matcha latte wasnt good and that price wise it could be more competitive."}
{"text":"Note there is a minimum charge of $8 per person.   Friend really wanted Lady M mille crêpe cake. Cafe had some nice ambience going on--really liked the pretty overhanging lights suspended above the high ceiling. There's a private lounge upstairs available for booking, but in general it was very quiet for a Saturday afternoon. The waitress with lens-less glasses was very attentive and helpful--I liked her service.  Anyway, Cappuccino ($3.95) tasted great; beans seem to be from Reunion Island Co.(favourite coffee roaster). Price charged is ok, market price usually between $3.25 - $4.00.  Holy craaaap!!! The crêpe cake was good but really should not have costed ~$18 a piece. Yes, there is a difference in texture. Lady M had thinner layers than other shops, and the cream did not get absorbed into the crêpe--making the whole cake soggy. However, the overall taste is the same. If you don't want a bleeding wallet, would highly suggest to purchase from cheaper alternative stores that should sell around $8 CAD a piece. Heard it was transported from New York in dried ice to Markham-- usually costs $8 USD a piece. That's a 56% markup!! Cafe should consider pricing their Lady M cakes on their menus so that unsuspecting customers do not get sent into cardiac arrest at the gargantuan price.   Will return for a nice chat with friends and try the more of the drinks and cakes. Will we get the crêpe cake again? Nope!"}
{"text":"We went to Zen Cafe yesterday and had a great time with friends. I personally like the modern atmosphere, the live band music and their service.  We had green tea latte, organic purple fried fries, baby octopus, and their Organic white wine. The wine was pretty smooth and the green tea Latte was not too sweet which is exactly what we want. This is a great place to meet with your business friends.   We wanted to order Lady M chocolate flavour but they don't carry it now. Wish they could have more flavours in the future."}
{"text":"Alright, I finally got a chance to come back to this amazing place to try their macarons which were out of stock last time. $2.75 each macaron and they are made by (La Bamboche). Slightly pricier than other macarons but the quality of these macarons are definitely top notch. They are large in size and the filling inside is super creamy and thick.   Also had a cup of caramel latte for $3.95 and vanilla latte for $3.95. Perfectly sweet but if you want to kick it up a notch in sweetness they offer honey crystal packs and not just your standard sugar.   I had to have another slice of Godiva chocolate cheese cake while I was here of course and also got to try the white chocolate blue berry cheese cake as well. There were shavings of white chocolate on top which was a nice touch. A very good cheese cake but my favourite is still the Godiva.  Service is always excellent here - probably because we were the only ones there at around 1:00pm on a Sunday. It probably gets a lot busier at night I guess. I highly recommend anyone with a sweet tooth like me to visit Zen Cafe. Even though the desserts are not made by Zen Cafe themselves they have done their research and brought over some of the best cheese cakes and macarons money can buy."}
{"text":"Went to the Richlane Mall to try a Korean restaurant and pleasantly found this little cafe next door.  Upon looking it up on Yelp, I discovered that they have various cakes from The Cheesecake Factory.  This was a nice surprise because now instead of waiting to drive down to the States, I can drive up the street to get one.  They also have assorted flavours of macaroons.  My husband and I decided to try some: mango coconut, raspberry cream cheese, green tea, chocolate, strawberry champagne and yuzu.  I've had other macaroons before and I couldn't even tell what flavours they were supposed to be, so it was quite refreshing to be able to differentiate between the various flavours.  I had tried the raspberry cream cheese one on the recommendation of the waitress and I was pleasantly surprised at its tastiness (I normally don't like raspberry flavouring).  I also really enjoyed the mango coconut macaroon.  The decor is modern and comfortable.  Overall, I would definitely go back to try some other desserts."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee and eat a cheesecake. I love that I am able to order actual Cheesecake Factory cheesecake! I'm a big fan of this restaurant in US and I think that it's amazing that they sell their cakes. The place is a little hidden gem in my opinion. Very nice sofa chairs, great design, love it! The waitress was really sweet and friendly, too. I went there when the place was almost empty and I did not know that they have $8 per person policy, but it's not a problem for me - cake and coffee will do it. Plus, I understand that the place is pretty small, the seating is limited, and some people just like to buy a drink, then sit in those comfy chairs for hours! So I think it's cool. I would be disappointed if I come in and the place is full with \"chillers\" - there is Starbucks for that reason. Will definitely come back, the cakes are good as they should be!"}
{"text":"So my bf and I walked in to a place that was empty. We asked if we could sit in the booth area and they said no the higher tables only. I am unable to sit on those because of my height and they cause leg pain. After mentioning that do you think they accommodated? NOPE. They were rude and said No. Considering the place was empty they should've rethought their response. Glad I didn't give them my money. Considering the reviews, talk about such terrible  service. Management should teach better customer service to their staff considering how rude they were. What a disappointment. If there was a choice to give no stars then I would but unfortunately I have to give one."}
{"text":"The Cafe had a semi casual ambience with couches and high tables to seat yourself and socialise with appetisers, drinks and deserts. I checked in and got a mini cheese cake which tasted really nice, but they told me I could only get it if I order an item off the menu. I was going to order much more, but I think they should stated that on the check in on Yelp because that can leave a bad impression as soon as customer enters your facility. I thought the self playing white piano was so cool. It set a relaxing jazzy environment for my friend and I.   The service was friendly and helpful especially when we didn't know what to order off the menu. I am not sure how fresh the desserts are as some of them comes from New York which means it was made a while back, and it's frozen, so they don't make a lot of the desserts in house. That being said I do not understand the high prices. The Lady M was $16 for a slice! Yikes! Had a macha latte which was alright, not bad and nothing great. Also had the chocolate mouse cake which was nice. It was chocolatey light and not too sweet. I could tell it was from frozen, so again I do not understand the high prises. I enjoyied my stay, but I woulnt come back."}
{"text":"Great service with friendly employees; thoughtful decorations on our Lady M Mille crepe as well"}
{"text":"Didn't have high expectations of this cafe since it's located in a chinese plaza, but the coffee turned out to be very good.  Ordered a red vanilla latte and organic cappuccino.  The 'reds' are caffeine free but tasted well balanced.  The barista did a nice design.  Cappuccino was good too although it could be a bit more foamier.  Overall a nice little shop with comfy seating.  Didn't get to try the snacks this time, but a good range of sweet and savory choices."}
{"text":"I like tea, love deserts but live for coffee. This cafe has it all and has it done right!    My sisters and I came here for the high tea menu (available on weekends only).   We were greeted by the owner Fiona who shared with us her vision of positive energy and commitment to quality at Zen Cafe.  They only serve the best in class deserts such as cheesecakes from The Cheesecake Factory and Lady M cakes. They source out the freshest bakery for pastries with no added preservatives or use GMO ingredients.  I pretty much ate everything on my plate. My favourite was the winter pear tart, sooooo refreshingly delicious.   Their teas are all organic loose leaf filtered by the cutest little tea pot.  Now, on to their coffee, it was specially selected from Columbia/Africa? Can't remember but the latte had a hint of sweetness without adding any sugar. It is one of the best latte I had in my life and I don't say that lightly.   In additional to sweets,  they also serve alcohol and small savoury snacks like popcorn chicken, yum!  We loved the decor of this cafe and the self playing piano.  There is also live jazz band on weekends. They have a private room on the second floor that fits up to 20 people, perfect for small celebrations like bachelorette part or birthdays."}
{"text":"Came here at around 6:00pm and it was completely empty.  The waitress told us to sit on the tall chairs but my friend and I wanted to sit on the couch. She told us that we might have to move later to the tall chairs because there might be more people. I was like, really? Are you kidding me, we're literally the only ones here.   And we were the only ones for the hour that we've spent there LOL  We sat on the couches anyways and we ordered the matcha latte and frappé, a sea salt caramel macaron and the layered red velvet cake!  Food and drinks were ok but overpriced! It was over $8 for a slice of cake ;-; *cries* Well since there is a $8 minimum charge per person I guess it kind of works out.  Wanted to try their character macaroons but unfortunately they didn't have any *cries again*  Cake was good but the matcha latte wasn't rich enough. Tasted like water mixed with powder :$   Service was kind of bad in general because most of the time the waitresses were just chatting with each other and weren't even paying attention to customers. We raised our hands for awhile but the waitresses didn't seem to notice until we called them over.  Overall, I guess this is a nice place to chill at with friends during tea time but I don't think that I would come again just because there are better alternatives out there."}
{"text":"It was nice n cozy atmosphere, friendly service, good place for tea and coffee with cheese cake... Cheese cake was amazing....... Must try all kind of tea they have, I tried Roasted almond tea... It was refreshing...!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am just so excited that Zen Cafe & Lounge opens at Richlane Mall. About time that this area has a decent cafe aside from all these bubble tea places!  Love hose oversized sofas and armchairs. I could just sink it in and chill for the afteroon.  There are over 12 different kind of organic tea to choose from. My nice server have a tray of samples for me to pick, most of them are herbal tea though. A pot of tea for $3.25 is quite reasonable.  If you are into sweet, you won't be disappointed as there are mini cakes, macarons and varieties of cheese cake from Cheesecake Factory to choose from.   There are various weekday specials.  And if you want a drink.. I  mean an alcoholic drinks, they do have beers and cocktails.  I will be back to try out their coffee or even have a matcha latte soon."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and feel. Nice decor to chill with friends for the evening! Had the Lady M signature crepe and it's on par as eating the ones in-store in New York!"}
{"text":"Zen cafe is a nice place for a quick break.  The decoration looks modern and relaxing.  The high ceiling creates an airy feel.    We ordered an Americano coffee, a latte, a white hot chocolate, and a double chocolate cheesecake.  The cheesecake was creamy and rich.  The Americano coffee tasted appropriately strong.  The latte came with coffee art on top.  I didn't ask the kid what she thought of her white chocolate.  Since she finished it, I guess she liked it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I paid $18.95 for a piece of crappy and fake lady M crepe cake!!!! It's such a rip off! I have tried the real one in LA and New York. This is totally not the same. Not only the cake is only half size of regular lady M and taste is awful. (Picture is attached) How can they used the official lady M picture to fool around the customers. Beware!!!  I'm still very mad about it. Is it even legal for them to use the name of lady M with this cheap home made cake!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Wednesday evening. Really nice and clean looking place. Great aesthetics. Cozy and good for photos. Food was decent. Ordered sweet potato fries (purple yam) and it was delicious! Played good music and apparently they play live music on weekends. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"The cake is definitely frozen for a very long time,is definitely not worth it.i just can't believe i drive half an hour for this"}
{"text":"I've been to zen cafe and lounge several times. The environment and waitress are really nice. I've tried lady m in New York. They carry the same lady m there. Which is really convenient. Whenever I miss the taste of lady m. I don't have to go to New York. Anyway, zen Cafe and Lounge is an amazing place to relax and chill with friends. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner with a friend for coffee. We only got lattes since we were stuffed from dinner but the owners were nice about it and even checking up on us with smiles. The best part is that didn't rush us at all. The ambiance of the cafe was very casual and comfortable.  My matcha latte was flavourful, you could actually taste the matcha unlike some places, aka Starbucks. And the barista attempted a nice coffee art despite the lack of foam. I told her that foam makes me sick so I can't have a lot of it and she came to check up later to see if the foam was too much or if it was all right. Service was amazing.   I'll definitely be back to try their other desserts next time."}
