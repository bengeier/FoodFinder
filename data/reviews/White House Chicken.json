{"text":"I've been there several times and only gotten the correct order once. Today was the last straw. I phoned in the order to save time. Arrived eleven minutes after the call, then had to wait an additional half hour! We were charged $11.89 for a 2pc cod fish dinner, which should have been piping hot since we had to wait, right? Nope. Warm, not hot. Ordered coleslaw, got a skimpy serving of about 2.5 ounces in 4 oz cup, too sweet for my taste. Ordered double mash potatoes for the other two sides. One mash potatoes was not even warm to the touch, room temp is more like it. The other mashed potatoes was - - - - - surprise! Green beans! Thank you for the green beans, it was the only hot item in the box. $11.89 and 40 minute wait for cold food and wrong side? Even if this were HOT, it isn't worth more than $6.00. Eat somewhere else, ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"i have tried the cuyahoga falls for the first time.they need to do better,frys were real dark and hardley much of them, compare to barberton or wadsworth.the hot sauce was a pink color instead of red,needs more paprika.the chicken was okay.they need to do a lot better being in the Falls. I will stick to Barberton I guess since the tallmadge one closed, which they were really good too."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and I decided to stop in to give it a try not worth it. No matter what you order it was not the best of food. If you wanted chicken you would of at least expect to go to a place like KFC or Giant Eagle. The Chicken was ok I ordered the Breast and fries with a Drink from the beverage case. 

   The fries were ok not the greatest, The Chicken Breast was so greasy that you wanted to use a knife and fork. to cut the chicken. I wonder what the health department says about all this food. .... 

  (Update from the owner) I did hear from the owner and he says He does not care what people think and he Loves greasy foods No matter how greasy it is he will serve it which is not healthy and not recommended. One thing That He mention was He not like KFC or anyone else that sells chickens like he does. 

   SO my advice would be if you don't like greasy chicken and I mean real greasy then this is not the place for you. I have seen worse chicken then this and this is the second worse chicken covered in grease that I can recall."}
{"text":"We'd heard and read about Barberton chicken and heard that this place was where to go to get some.  Yikes.  Greasy, greasy chicken with bad flavor.  The fries were soggy and greasy.  The mashed potatoes were instant with crust lumps.  Instant gravy.  This is the worst fried chicken I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"OK, tried this place for the first time on 3-6-11.  The chicken seemed to be a little over cooked and the flavor was very bland, The Slaw was horrible, Mashed Potatoes and gravy were OK (no biscuits)
It almost seemed as if they didnt spice the chicken at all.  i dont beleive I will return (KFC right around the corner)
OVERALL - 2 out of 10"}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to try White House chicken out for lunch at the Tallmadge location. Worst decision we possibly could have made. The man working was incredibly rude and seemed very annoyed at our presence. We were the only customers in the place which should have been a red flag considering that it was 12:30. When returning back to our work location, we opened a box of disappointment. The coleslaw was awful, it was pretty much just cabbage and vinegar. The potatoes were awful as well, very bland gravy. The chicken was the worst part, It had the consistency of fried rubber and had absolutely no seasoning. Absolutely awful, I would only recommend to people that I absolutely despise and wanted to see them suffer. gross."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place.   We got the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes and fries.  The chicken tenders were HUGE! the owner was super friendly and clean store!"}
{"text":"The food here taste great.  The Hot Rice is the best side especially for Chicken Tenders and Fries.  There are a few reasons for the removal of 1 star.  There is not enough room to host a lot of people in there.  And the prices are not the greatest.  To make up for it though, They make and package the food in front of you.  And the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My companion and I recently watched an excerpt from a television show named \"Food Feuds\", hosted by renowned Cleveland chef Michael Symon.  The show pits food rivals against each other in towns around America and then Symon decides who he believes offers the better product.

I am from the greater Cleveland area, my companion from the greater Pittsburgh area.  We thought it would be fun to make the 1 hour drive on a weekend, to try the famous chicken.
In the mean time, we checked in on the websites of both chicken restaurants, White House and Belgrades.
White House has a great coupon offer.  Provide them your email address and within a few days they send you a $5 coupon.  Both of us provided our email addresses and each received the coupon.  Next stop - White House Chicken (Tallmadge, Oh. location) next Saturday!

Saturday rolls around and we are off on a beautiful Saturday afternoon on our way to White House Chicken in Tallmadge, Oh.  
We were hungry and excited to try the food.  We had reviewed the online menu so already knew what we would be ordering.

The place is carry out only.  The building sits way off the road in a rather remote location.  We were the only customers there (3 pm'ish) which felt a bit...odd.

We walk in and to the order counter where a gentleman arrives without even greeting us.  Zero eye contact.  We felt very awkward.  We later learned this gentleman is \"James\", the owner.
As he continued to stair downward at the register, he asked for our order.  I thought I would break the ice and told him that we just drove an hour to get here because we heard how good the Barberton chicken is.  
He didn't make a peep...didn't even look up from the register.  He looked very annoyed.  This should have been our cue to walk out, but unfortunately, we stayed.
I ordered the 2 breast and 2 drumettes  dinner.  With the coupon the dinner was around 9 dollars.  Not bad.  I took a seat against the wall.
My companion ordered the same dinner, just different side dishes.  
This is where things got uglier.  She hands him her coupon.  He yells over to me and asks if I printed the coupon twice from the same email.  
No, James...We both sent our email addresses to get the coupons.  He starts accusing me of making a double copy.  Are you kidding me?!  This guys behavior was so reprehensible.  We were in shock.  He took the coupon and walked away.  We sat down just staring at each other like, did that guy just behave that way?  We didn't know what to do.  This guy is frightening.

After about 25 minutes of watching him literally cursing at raw chicken as he prepared our meals, he made it back to the counter with our order.  Plopped it on the counter, said to my companion that her order is on the bottom.  No eye contact, no thank you come again, no nothing.
This was the craziest experience I've ever had anywhere....hands down!

We left...bewildered.

 We found a nice park with a picnic bench nearby so we stop there to eat.  I open my container.  Only 1 chicken breast.  I paid for the 2 breast dinner.  James gypped me.
 My companion ordered the same dinner...her dinner had 2 breasts.

Ok...no biggie.  I'm ok with 1 breast.  Ain't no way I'm going back to that place to ask James to make my order right..  That owner really needs remedial training.  Holy smokes.

So... Barberton chicken, , hot sauce, slaw and French fries....It all tasted great!  Dunking the chicken into that delicious hot sauce is a GREAT combination.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised.

Now....Here's the real ugly part.  9 hours later, we both find ourselves slaves to the toilet.  Everything was going through us like a bullet train.  This is unbelievable.  All was fairly ok by late next morning.  But obviously, there was something horribly wrong with that chicken.  That store.  That very rude, unfriendly owner.

Folks, I believe that Barberton chicken in Barberton and other satellite locations other than Tallmadge, probably put out a very good product.  They have been around a very long time from what I've read.

The chicken and hot sauce really did appear to be great so I encourage you to try the other locations.
I don't know or understand what is going on at that Tallmadge location.  I don't understand how any business owner could believe that the type of behavior I witnessed with the Tallmadge owner could be acceptable.  He is no ambassador for the company and should not be representing them.
 If I had an employee that behaved the way the owner of this location did, I would fire him or her on the spot.

If anyone from WHC corporate would like to reach out to me for further comments, I would be more than happy to help.  

Cheers,

Jim"}
{"text":"Stopped here one night for take out. True they lost to Belgrades in food wars, but in the past their food wasn't bad. Now... it's horrible! The hot rice wasn't bad but the fries and chicken gives Webster's a whole new definition of bad. Their breading in the past was more of a thicker breading that covered the whole piece of chicken. Now it's seems drier and where before it stayed on, now it seemed to fall off so it almost had no breading and what was left was so hard it was difficult to chew. Will we be back? only if they are the only place left on earth!"}
{"text":"Not worth it.. the chicken was not very good and the breading was horrible. Go to KFC instead."}
{"text":"I have been getting White House chicken in tallmadge for years.. moved to brunswick and we have one here!! Always  great chicken!!"}
{"text":"I purchased two groupons for this place when they opened and I have been going to get their food to go for my family since. It is so much better than any other chicken I have eaten! The local fast food chain can not compare. Yes, there is a wait so call ahead and order!! It is worth the wait! The chicken was so hot and fresh that it was still hot when I made it home after running and errant 30 min later. The fries are fresh cut and awesome! I ask for them extra crispy bc that's how I like them. The mashed potatoes are great. The green beans are pretty good too. I LOVE the hot sauce rice. It is pretty spicy though so keep that in mind. The thing I like the most is that the owner uses my name when I visit. He and his wife seem to really care about their customers. I highly recommend their food and I think anyone who likes good crispy fried chicken should visit and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best chicken I have had my family loves it!! Will be back!!!even my super picky 2 year old ate all of his food made my day!!"}
