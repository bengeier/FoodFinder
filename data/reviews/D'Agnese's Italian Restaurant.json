{"text":"Came in for just drinks and some food at the bar on a Friday night. Two of us sat at the bar right in the middle no one else around and it still took 5 mins before anyone came to ask for a drink order. I could have made a drink myself in that time. Finally a bartender noticed us and got our drinks.  After food and two rounds of drinks we tried to cash out and leave. We put coats on, stood up from the bar stools , even called out loud were ready to cash out holding our card. The female bartender totally ignored us and spend her time chatting with her friends at other the bar. Our $79 tab wasn't worth the time apparently and it took us 15 mins just to cash out.  Great food & drinks ruined by terrible service.  We send an email to management to just let them know not expecting anything. No one bothered to even reply. I'll spend my money else where next time. Not worth the terrible service go to someplace else where they take care of you and are willing to let you just pay the bill when your ready."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place.  Not too fancy but yet a classy vibe.  We had chicken parmigiano which was not on the menu and veal parmigiano.   Both were delicious!   The waiter was attentive.   We enjoyed a bottle of wine with our meal but I thought it was a bit expensive.   I googled it and found it was a $10 bottle of wine that we paid $32 for.  Other than that, nice place."}
{"text":"Best Italian food around.  Anything with the D'Agnese sauce is a must ! Homemade veal meatballs and delicious salads round out a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant clearly saw its hay day back in 2010, 2012 when it won a lot of awards. The salad was clearly pre-made (soggy greens, cold plate from being in the fridge.) The tomato sauce had very little flavor. This restaurant clearly has seen better days. Skip it."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. The recipes seem to have stayed true to the original. the Cantine next door is also very nice Lots of good beers in the cooler and on Tap. Lots of wines too(which I really don't care for)"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Stuffed pepper appetizer is quite good! Saltimboca is excellent as well!  Kids love chicken Parmesan. Generous portions and reasonable prices. Fairly extensive wine list. Great local place to enjoy an evening out."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and stuffed mushrooms. My husband and I love to come here for a good Italian meal and great wime selections."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went to D'Agnese's for dinner and this was the first time for us at the new location.  My heart skipped a beat when they brought the bread and tapenade instead of the wonderful dipping sauce with the pepper rings in it that I am used to. But I asked for it and they were quick to bring it. I ordered the crab stuffed salmon with rice as my side and my husband ordered fish (I think it was halibut) served over gnocchi with sun dried tomatoes. His was really good but mine was spectacular. For starters and most importantly in my book, the salmon was cooked to perfection, then topped with crab and mozzarella cheese and fresh mushrooms. What made the flavors all come together was that by the mushrooms they had some of the marsala sauce (I think) and on the other side of the plate they had their famous lemon butter sauce. Simply the best!"}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend and was expecting it to be very expensive. It was very reasonably priced and the food was amazing. I had the veal D'Agnese, which was the best veal I've had in Ohio. It was tender and tasted amazing. It also came with a huge side of pasta.  The portions were huge and the price was low. Besides that the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasing. I would go back in a heartbeat if I'm around that way."}
{"text":"We were there last night with a party of 10 for a birthday dinner. I don't know if I could say enough nice things about this restaurant. From the moment we walked in we were treated with class. The service was impeccable. We got some drinks at the bar while waiting for our table to get ready (short wait) and the bartenders were very accommodating and quick with the drink orders. Hillary, our server, was beyond nice and very attentive. Very knowledgeable about the wine list and brought our bottles out quickly. From the bread, to the appetizers, to the main course all of the food was amazing. Personally I had the veal parmigiana and pasta and couldn't finish it all (brought what was left of the pasta home). Huge portions of delicious food, great service, wonderful atmosphere. I would recommend this place to any one of my family and friends."}
{"text":"Consistently some of the best italian food around -- the service and ambiance is great, too!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE Service!!!!  Went to the bar and we were unfortunate to have the Rudest Waitress we have ever experienced! (Try not to get the one who bartends and has the bump-it ponytail - you will regret it.) She complained about our request for seperate checks...told us we were just going to have to wait....hour later....we finally got our checks....she overcharged us four glasses of wine!  Never came to check on us during dinner!  Awful!  Totally made us feel that we were putting her out! Just so completely rude! PS - Do not get the Eggplant Parmasean!  Food - overpriced and not worth it!"}
{"text":"D'Agnese's has been our favorite restaurant since my husband and I started dating 16 years ago.  We even had our rehearsal dinner there when we got married.  We have never, even once, been disappointed.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  Food quality and service are consistently excellent.  Our favorites are the lasagna (it just melts in your mouth) and the Chicken D'Agnese (love the flavor, great sauce).  Definitely worth checking out if you want real, authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Visited here last night for the first time with two of my friends and it was excellent. The portions are huge and I had plenty for left over. I called the restaurant to see if there was call ahead setting or if we needed to and they were at an hour wait, but I was told that we could sit at the bar until a table opened. I called 20-25 minuets before we were planning to meet there and when we walked in we were seated right away. The staff was very welcoming on the phone and in person. I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant looks more like it would be located in downtown Cleveland rather than a suburban strip mall (that's a good thing). We had 7:30 reservations, arrived at 7:00, and had a drink at the bar. The place was packed which I took as a good sign. The bartender was attentive, cordial and provided us w/ menu recommendations (which we took).  We ordered eggplant rollatini (ok, needed seasoning), pasta fagiole (ok, too tomato-ey), chicken d'agnese (excellent), and veal saltimbocca (excellent) w/ pasta bolognese (very good) sides. We couldn't believe the size of entrees for the price, they were huge. Unbelievable value and they were excellent. I never saw that much veal on a plate. Oh yeah, and the service was excellent.   I've lived in this area for 20 years and never went to this resaturant. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great upscale place to dine.  Can be very loud and crowded due to the number of people that enjoy eating here.  The food is very good."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  I'm from out of town.  My wife and I stopped to stay in a hotel nearby.  I looked for local restaurants on Yelp and took a chance on D'Agnese's.  Boy did we hit the jackpot.  The food outstanding, the service was great, prices are reasonable and what a beer selection.  It'll make your head spin.  I can't tell you that I'll ever be back in Cleveland, but if I am, I will eat here again.  Good luck to the D'Agnese family in the new location."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you are looking for fantastic food, excellent drinks, and friendly service - then you have found the right place. Whenever I've been here it takes me forever to order because I could literally eat anything on their menu. The bartenders are great and are there to make sure you enjoy your time. Make sure you see Phil behind the bar for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is terrible ... I had a meatball with my eggplant parm... ZERO flavor in the meatball ... Worst meatball of my life!!! The eggplant was almost as bad!! What a disappointment . Probobly the worst Italian restaurant I've ever been to by far!! How can you screw up a meatball??????"}
{"text":"Sick to my stomach. Will never come back. Horrible experience. Waitress was very rude and food had no flavor. The meatballs wow disgusting like very obvious they are not homemade. Never again."}
{"text":"Thought we had a reservation at this location and it turned out to be at another. They made sure to accommodate us and as always the food was incredible. Started with calamari which was sensational. We have been here often and I order a custom shrimp fra'diavolo that even with as busy as they were due to holiday bookings, they made without question or hesitation. You will not be disappointed. Definitely one of our favorite."}
{"text":"Just ok. Have to add seasoning to everything.  Salt & pepper your pasta, salad.... It's not very tasty. Like a Buca di Bepo...... taste-wise."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day after seeing its good Yelp reviews, and this is one place that warrants the hype.  We had a flat iron steak special, house salad (candied walnuts, goat cheese, vinagrette), and tiramisu for dessert.  The meal started with bread fresh out of the oven (literally piping hot, in a good way), and a great vinagrette/oil dip that quickly disappeared. Delicious start, and the meal that followed was on par. The steak was cooked properly and was very juicy. The tiramisu was a great dessert, and if anything the size was almost too large -- definitely has to be shared, and may even be too much for two people.  This place is reasonably priced for its quality -- our meal ran us a hair under $25, though the dinner menu will be more like $25 per person. Try the lunch!"}
{"text":"Still meh... Ordered the herb crusted chicken.  Why is it served with a port wine reduction?  Not a good blend with chicken and risotto on the plate.  And the \"reduction\" was thin and watery.  Sorry, D'Agnese's but you have officially slipped and I won't go back."}
{"text":"Simply stunning Italian food.  Start to finish, you'll taste the fresh ingredients here.  Not to be missed.  Bar is good, wine selection great and the service tops it all off for a great evening.  Worth your while to try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been very pleased with both experiences.  I recently celebrated a friend's birthday here with 6 other individuals.  We had a reservation but were happily surprised at how well we were accommodated.  I had the ricotta ravioli with asparagus and crab meat.  It was delicious! I also had some of the eggplant appetizer as well as the goat cheese appetizer and artichoke appetizer.  They were all very good.  The wine and drinks list is very extensive which was fabulous for our group.  Some of us shared a couple bottles of wine while the others had drinks from the bar.  I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great salads and calamari. The bar area is very comfortable and not a cheesy bar but classy. Prices are reasonable; similar to Carabbas but better quality and menu selections and certainly not as dark. There is a small area for kids. I love wine and their house selection is nice. No draft beer but who needs that.  Try an Italian beer or a local one--enjoy. I go here twice a month."}
{"text":"Loving it.  Reasonable prices and a good atmosphere.  I prefer it as a date spot.  The one downfall is the marinara sauce.  Way salty and just unimpressive.  Everything else is great though."}
{"text":"AMAZING food.  Used to work here back in the day and ever since I have been craving Artichoke D'Agnese, the paninis, and pretty much everything else.  The food is seriously to die for! You would be a fool to skip this place :)"}
{"text":"Must go to D'Agnese's more often. Their Chicken D'Agnese, accompanied by risotto, is to die for. My husband is a huge fan of their lasagna. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just for the heck of it!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant often. Today I enjoyed lunch with a glass of Badiola wine ($7)and their Eggplant Parmigiana (battered eggplant slices with mozzarella and marinara sauce), for $8."}
{"text":"The bread in the dips are great. The pasta was so good . This is a fancy place for dinner ."}
{"text":"I've been going here since 1993 or so, two moves ago.  It has been my favorite restaurant for the majority of those years.  The past three years, I spent being disappointed in a couple changes I noticed. Little details only a regular would notice, for example, the first time I went to the current location, I got those shitty foil wrapped butters served with my bread and my favorite old menu item (chicken rollatini) was no longer  available, even by special request!  I emailed them afterwards, really blunt and angry email... Something about sacrificing quality and pissing off all their clients. Anyway, I went to a family birthday dinner this week.  The amazing garlic butter was back and what did I discover on the menu?  Not chicken rollatini, but the exact recipe with salmon instead of chicken.  It was the best plate of food I had in a while.  Crab stuffed salmon. Go get some now."}
{"text":"I came here on a mission.l, I had a craving for Fra diavolo and this place had one with calamari.  The sauce was perfect and the meal was delicious.  I would have preferred a variety of seafood over just the calamari, but it was so good I can't even complain.  It sated the craving perfectly!  But that wasn't even the best part of the meal.  We ordered the baked cheese appetizer and wolfed it down.  It was delicious.  We both thought it would be worth coming back just for that appetizer."}
{"text":"How hard is it to mess up a meatball? I mean really, a meatball?  My order of meatballs and spaghetti yielded something that looked like it came with meatballs but had no taste at all.  Literally there was nothing whatsoever that indicated any meat taste.  How much filler is D'Agnese using?  You know, I feel bad for Ohioans.  Most will never know what wonderful cuisine is unless they have traveled to major cities.  Why can't Cleveland in particular catch up with the rest of the country when it comes to FRESH, uncompromised food?  Why are the residents of this city perfectly content to eat brown avacados, limp pickle spears, waxy coconut cake and tasteless meatballs?  Enough already."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Atmosphere was nice and all the appetizers were freshly made.  Ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms, baked goat cheese and calamari for a large group and there was plenty to go around.  Dinner special was delicious and cocktails were very nice."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Located in a strip mall and next to subway, who would know the food is so wonderful. Order anything D'Agnese which is a butter sause...I get the veal and a sid Le of spaghetti with olive oil and garlic. Enough to bring get home a day eat again the next day. Wnjoy!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants. Their scallops are sometimes the best I've had, and it was closer to 4.5 stars. And sometimes they still are.   Tonight my husband ordered the scallops and I ordered the blackened salmon.   Salmon was flavorful but the balsamic reduction was lacking. Could have used more to balance the seasoning on the salmon, and it tasted a bit bland.   The scallops weren't seared, but overcooked where they start to have a rubbery texture. The dinner used to be paired with a goat cheese risotto, and the vegetable or saffron risotto just isn't the same    All in all good. When prepared right, the food is fantastic.  All other times, beware."}
{"text":"Someone dropped the ball last night or the restaurant doesn't care about take out orders.  Ordered takeout last night.  Just simple penne pasta with sausage and meatballs and Caesar salad.  The pasta was not cooked well, the food was cold when we received it.  Salad was not a Caesar salad nor was the dressing and the bread hadn't been warmed up at all like it usually is.  Sausage very blah.  Will never order carry out from here again.  Cost me $35 when I could have went to the local pizza shop and had the same thing that would have been much better for $10.00.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"I just love this restaurant,    Service was great,  I am in love with Shrimp D'Agnese      Its 24 hours later--------- I am trying to figure out when I can return to this restaurant again.......There food is outstanding. From a world traveler"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is. Never in a million years would we have stopped by expecting such a fantastic dining experience. The place is in a non-descript strip mall in the middle of nothing. But once inside... Perfection. The ambiance is brilliant, the lighting soft, the music heard but not loud, the decor has class... Couldn't ask for much more. We visited after seeing some glowing reviews of the service, and the reviews don't do this place justice. We visited late on Valentine's day, expecting a tired staff, the \"end of day\" food and a rushed experience. We were wrong across the board. The staff was extremely inviting. Our waiter was perfect, seemingly appearing like magic to clear dishes and refresh drinks. The food was prompt and fresh. I have never experienced a steak that was so obviously fresh off the grill in a restaurant before. I can not recommend this place enough. The staff alone sets the bar to which all other restaurants, at any level, should strive. Bravo!"}
{"text":"So why do parents think that it is ok to bring their annoying children to a nice restaurant?  In Broadview Heights, it seems like children eat out every night.  My wife and I arrived early to have a drink at the bar--and the bar area is quite nicely decorated--but then a family of 4 gets the table in the bar and presto, the ambiance is gone and we are having martini's at Chuck E Cheese.  The bar gets very crowded and it can be difficult to find a seat.  The food is good, especially the Veal D'Agnese and the Grouper Picatta but as others have mentioned, a bit overpriced.    As we were leaving, I saw a little boy sitting at the bar with his family eating dinner.  Come on.  There are adults crowded in trying to have a drink while this selfish family hogs up the bar.  Shame on the management for allowing this."}
{"text":"Have had a few of their dishes at the the bar...good service, good food, and good drinks ! Bar looks like it's well stocked and bartenders are fast and friendly. BAR is small but nice. Have not eaten on the tables but they always seem full. For tables I would recommend reservations. Great parking."}
{"text":"Clear the air regarding price, service, and wait staff... We were dining at D'Agnese's the same time the couple \"Sophia M\" were getting their to go order. It happened to be D'Agnese's businesst hour of the week. The resturant was full, as was the bar area. Anyhow, we were the \"friends\" they referenced. However, the truth is, we had never met the bartender Tony before, nor any of the other patrons. Like Sophia M, we just stopped for a nice dinner. Perhaps because Tony was so friendly, they assumed we were friends. But no need to rehash the evening's events.  D'Agnese's makes their food fresh and from high quality ingredients. So it takes a little longer to prepare and \"yes\" the cost exceeds Olive Garden (I agree with other reviews, its a little pricey). But D'Agnese's, Olive Garden, and even Burger King employees will find it difficult to take the rude, condescending behavior of this couple. No less than five other couples, none of which we had met before that evening, all had similar comments about Sophia M's behavior.   Hopefully you will learn one of the simplest lessons in life: \"Treat others as you wish to be treated.\" In this case, that came to fruition, however, not from the staff they took the abuse and smiled, but your fellow patrons had enough of you."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible!  I have had some pretty amazing Italian food, but their shrimp D'Agnese dish is out of this world."}
{"text":"Crab stuffed 'shrooms  are the best I've ever had, and I'm an aficionado....  Wine selection is very good and fairly priced.    The entries are amazing and generous portions.   Mindy the bar tender is awesome, friendly and \"on her game.\""}
{"text":"The service is awesome - our server was really kind and genuinely interested that we have a good experience.  The menu isn't super creative but the food is good! We got different pastas and a special at our table. They were all really good. Prices are pretty much what you would expect to pay for a mid-upscale Italian dinner...+\- $20-$30 for an entree and drinks are around $10 per. They have a good wine list and the decor is warm and inviting.  If you go before 4pm on a Sunday, the whole restaurant is not open. The \"cafe\" is open which is soup, salad and sandwiches. I think that's kind of silly but hey, it's not my restaurant lol!"}
{"text":"Of the 4 meals at our table, bouliabase was poor and the Bolagnase had little meat and small portion. The other 2 meals were salads. To make it worse our server was rude and inattentive.  I used to have this restraunt bookmarked. No more."}
{"text":"Great service as always. The fried mozzarella is our favorite appetizer. I usually get the gnocchi but anything you get will be great. Pictured is the Mocha cheesecake. Seriously the best cheesecake I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Broadview Heights, cannot go wrong withe chicken D'agneses. The service is fantastic and attentive."}
{"text":"Prices are veru reasonable and the food is AWESOME. All the dishes we tried were great."}
{"text":"Hands down my FAV restaurant EVER. Sooo happy it's literally right up the street from my house which leads to take out almost every single weekend  You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My absolute favorites are the chicken carbanara and veal saltimbolca. The garlic butter spread is amazing for bread, the raspberry cheesecake is to. Die. For.   Writing this post has got me hungry, might have to make a call for some carry out tonight"}
{"text":"I love D'Agnese's!  Everything tastes SO Fresh.  It's affordable.  Quality is great.  I first came here many years ago and have not been coming in frequently enough.  Mostly because it can get quite busy!  I see however yelp has a handy dandy little reservation feature built on D'Agnese's page here.  My favorite appetizer is the sausage stuffed peppers.  The seasonings zing your senses.  Fried Raviolis are also quite appetizing.  Crunchy yet creamy.  The eggplant parm is the best around.  Great quality and quantity.  So so tasty."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was underwhelmed!  Couldn't get pasta in an italian restaurant?!  Salad with tenderloin tips meat was overdone and tough.  Coffee was very weak.  Restaurant was cold and outside temp was warmest in weeks!sweet potatoe fries were very good and highlight but couldn't make up for other failings."}
{"text":"Wow... Absolutely incredible! Wish I had known about this place sooner. 5 stars for this Italian delight! Atmosphere, delicious food, great presentation and fantastic service. Don't pass this one up.  Get a reservation for this weekend. If you can that is..."}
{"text":"Nothing here was fresh.  The chicken marsala cutlets were dried out on the edges meaning freezer burn or made much earlier.  The dish arrived cold in the middle and over sauced. The mushrooms were from a can!  The pesto pasta was bland- just oil and basil (badly separated) and had no pine nuts in the mix.  Our shrimp and crab appetizer was the same- pre made frozen (how else do shrimp with grill marks arrive cold (and DRENCHED in sauce).  Also, I had 2 of the same drink from their drink menu.  The second one came out made with wrong ingredients.  They were not busy either.  The service was good.  This place used to be good- I won't go back."}
{"text":"D'Agnese's is consistently wonderful Italian food. I have yet to go there and not have a delicious experience! Tonight for the first time I ordered the pork chop from the menu. Amazing! Often I'm reluctant to dine out on Sunday evenings, but I was very pleased with quality of food and service. I'm very happy to have a high-quality restaurant in the neighborhood that my husband and I can frequent for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"fantastic food, below-average service.  i really enjoyed my linguine maranara with meatballs.  good sauce, large meatballs.  fairly modern decor, especially given the location.  our waitress was aloof/flighty and made several mistakes.  nonetheless, we enjoyed our meal there.  average to above-average prices.  recommended if you're local."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  The food was terrific, portions were generous and service friendly and efficient.  We were with people who come here regularly and we understand why.  The veal was wonderful.  It's too bad we don't live closer, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch after reading the reviews on Yelp. There were four of us. Our waitress I believe was named Chris. She was very pleasant and pretty attentive. I had the eggplant which was some of the best I have ever had and ,I always order eggplant when I see it on the menu. My father had Chicken Marsala which he loved. You could cut it with a fork. My husband had the Chicken D'Agnese which he throughly enjoyed. My stepmother had a large tossed salad and tomato basil soup which she said was excellent. All the food came piping hot to the table. Bread was good with a tapenade and also a garlic butter. The sides of pasta were also good. This will be our new favorite lunch spot. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic food, my favorite Italian restaurant in this area!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! Went out to dinner here with a friend and of course some drinks to start the weekend on a good note.  We sat at the bar in which Phil was our bartender and he took real good care of us.  It is located at the end of the plaza and when you walk in, it definitely gives you a romantic feel. People were dressed semi formal and majority of them looked like they were on a date.  The calamari was so amazingly delicious with the dipping sauce.  It was lightly salty and crispy.  Unlike most places I've been to, it didn't get soggy after 30 minutes of letting it sit.  I ordered pasta and the sauce was full of flavor with the right amount of spice. Usually I would have to add salt and pepper to my pastas but this dish definitely didn't need it.  Overall service and food was excellent and I would recommend anyone to visit this place for a great date night experience or a formal girls night out."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern:  I am hopeful this note finds its way to the owner(s) of D'Agnese's of Broadview Heights. I am writing to tell you about the experience my party had at your restaurant today at approximately noon.    Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hostess, Nadine.  She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar and we politely said we'd prefer a table. On the way to our table, she told the server we'd be in his section to which he replied \"Are you ever going to seat someone in YOUR section Nadine?!\" This was right in front of us as well as the other customers seated.  I then excused myself and went to the restroom.  On leaving the restroom, Nadine was standing outside the kitchen complaining about us not having wanted seated at the bar.  2 times in 5 minutes we heard your employees complaining about us as customers. We then decided it would be best if we took our business elsewhere.  While leaving the restaurant, I stopped and asked Nadine who the owners were and how I could get in contact. She stated there were 3 owners, but that she would be the one to talk to.  I explained why were we leaving and again asked for the owners name. She stated the owner I would need to talk to is 'Mia'.    I asked for the other 2 owners names and she refused to provide them. Per your 'about' section on your website, there is no owner named Mia.  I suspect we were lied to by Nadine. Let the record show that throughout this ordeal, we were never once told \"Sorry\". This is not the first time we've had issues with your hostess Nadine, but it will be the last as we will not be returning.  Which is a shame because you had wonderful food.  But that's only part of the dining equation.   Thank you."}
{"text":"I give D'Agneses a 5 star, the service is great; our server, Brain, is so excellent and caring.  The atmospheres and the décor are very classic and elegant.  It is suited for romantic and date dinning.  The portion is large and price is very reasonable.  Warning: reservation is must in the weekend and holiday.   Their bread is great with the crushed olive spread.  I order the wedding soup and my wife have the Tomato and Mozzarella salad.  Soup is very tasty and the salad with the reduced balsamic dressing is perfect match with the chesses and fresh tomato.  However, the full portion of the salad is large, be careful.    I order the Pistachio crusted Lamb rack and my wife has the Zuppa di Pesce w/ lobster tail (seafood linguini).  My lamb was cooked perfectly with the crusted pistachio, very tasty.  My wife's linguini came with tomato based calm sauce, touch of spices, perfect.  Their portion is large and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY want to like D'Agnese's. It's very close to home, it's a very nice looking place, it's very close to home.  Decided to try again, and, again, it just underwhelms.  One of the main reasons people love Italian food is FLAVOR.  Yes, capital letters.  BIG, BOLD, F L A V O R. But, D'Agnese's simply refuses to speak, write, or cook above a whisper. Tonight we got a Caesar Salad, Wedding Soup, Egg Plant Rollatini and a Mediterranean Salad. There was nothing wrong with any of it. But, sadly, there was nothing right with any of it either. It's like they are cooking for people who can't have any herbs or spices. For goodness sake, the bacon in their Caesar was TASTELESS!   Seriously, just HOW exactly do you take the flavor out of bacon?? HOW? Folks, this is one of life's major mysteries.    Yes, I know it's popular, but so is Olive Garden.  Am I comparing the two? No, because I haven't been to an Olive Garden since the year they opened here. Hell, for all I know Olive Garden might be better; sure as heck can't be much worse.   If D'Agnese's wants to see and--much more importantly--TASTE how it's done, maybe they should just mosey up Broadview to just north of Pleasant Valley and go to Eddie's.  Comparing one to the other is like comparing a Vespa to a Bugati.  Yes, they might both be made in Italy, but  one is pure sizzle and class and the other is a very minor diversion at best.  The fact both restaurants share the same price point should embarrass D'Agnese's management to their core.   Shame on them for the mediocrity they produce."}
{"text":"Went there with big group and was treated very well. Kept wine glasses and bread baskets filled. All entrees looked good... I went with Chicken d'Agnese which had a great sauce. The pasta was great, calamari wonderful and fried goat cheese perfect. Didn't find prices that outrageous as other reviewer did. The portions justify the prices as almost everyone at our table went home with a doggy bag."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are very generous from the appetizers to the salads to the entrées.  Everything I've had here is delicious.  Service is always exemplary.  A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"If you like Italian food south of Cleveland this is a must try place. The restaurant is situated in a shopping plaza with a sister restaurant next to it that I will also be reviewing very soon. The interior is very inviting and I would say average. However, the food and service is what make my wife and myself really enjoy this restaurant. Our waiter was very attentive and even apologized when we sat down because he was going to be serving the food to a very large party. We really appreciated this. We started with the appetizer special, grilled octopus over a bed of arugula. This was prepared perfectly! We have had octopus all across the country and I will say it can be very chewy when over cooked. However, this was cooked to perfection and had a nice grilled taste. Next my wife had the Caesar salad which she enjoyed and I had pasta fagiole which also was very good. I thought there was an even amount of pasta and cannellini beans. Then our main dishes were the veal caesarino and my wife had the filet mignon oscar. She enjoyed her dish, but the steak was a little undercooked. However, I thought my dish was amazing. It was fried veal chops, in a butter sauce, topped with onions, mushrooms, and strips of Genoa salami. The salami added a saltiness to the dish that I really felt put it over the top. Make sure to take a but with the veal, onions and Genoa salami all together!"}
{"text":"The Half Caesar Salad with Chicken was really good . The sundried tomatoes really give it a nice taste."}
{"text":"Good service,  but tonight, poorly prepared food. Mushy eggplant on one order and mushy salmon combined with mushy risotto that claimed to have saffron, but had none of the flavor of such in the other order."}
{"text":"don't forget to order food after you splurge into that deliciousssss bread w garlic butter"}
{"text":"Beautiful contemporary design, adequate staffing, and a nice selection of moderately priced wines. The menu is full of great choices. Excellent restaurant. Call for reservations, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"Service was good.  No complaints there.  Went here for a special birthday celebration and made mention of it when I made reservation.  Was told that if I ordered dessert they would provide a candle.  That didn't even happen.  Wedding soup had about three meatballs in this huge bowl.  Mostly celery and carrots.  Salad was good.  Herb chicken was too sweet for my liking.  Steak was average.  Was 120$ for two people.  I guess I expected it to be better than it was."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of the neighbors for a birthday. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The menu had a common Italian dishes. At Italian restaurants I usually order chicken parm, but they apparently took that off the menu. Even though they took it off of their menu, I was able to still order it- very accommodating! They have warm bread to eat while waiting for your meal- best part of Italian restaurants! Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I just discovered a new favorite! I've driven by for years! and now i'm kicking myself! the food fabulous! Bogdan the server is charming, courteous and easy on the eyes! I will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Once you step into this place, you'll forget you're in the highest of the heights. The tables have chairs and are even elegant. The waiters and waitresses all speak proper English and are not hostile. You don't have to pay in advance.   The night we went there it was raining outside so I pulled up to the door to allow the ladies to avoid getting wet. A gentleman in a yellow hummer honked at me. Since we were close to the Seneca Apartments and some seedy beer sloughs where these broken people get liquored up, I assumed he was mad and wanted to fight me. He didn't. He wanted to ask me something so I reluctantly rolled the window down.   \"Hey. Buddy. Ferga dant way?\" I don't know what to say to this person and he repeated himself so I said, \"Yeah. Guess so. Thanks.\" My fiancé and her colleague had entered already and I wanted desperately to park the car but the hatted man was still looking at me. \"Is it or ain't it?\" I smiled, he called me a homo and I quickly drove away less a man than I ought to be. I'm engaged, by the way.  The calamari at D'Agnese is a mountain of fried goodness and if you were to share it with a table of eight, you'd be full and not need an entrée at all. While sipping a glass of a fine Tre Bicchieri (2009) I allowed my mind to wander and imagined a grimy but exciting scene of the restaurant's own 125 foot quad diesel purse seiner gut-trawling a quarter million hectares of the Mediterranean just to keep this fine establishment in squid rings. They sell a lot of calamari. Excellent dipping sauce.  The Chicken D'Agnese is better choice than the Veal D'Agnese because you get more. No one at your table gives you the veal look either which is always meal-enhancing. It costs about the same and both are awesome with lemon and capers and a small bowl of oily pasta to go with it. The bread is fresh and good. Desserts are not an option especially if you get one of their immense salads.  Sometimes there are cosmo-drinking lonely women at the bar and they'll ogle men in the dining area even if the men are clearly with women. There are decorative barricades to keep them as isolated as possible. Be warned though, if a grizzled and sotted tart looks past you towards a table of seniors and licks her lips longingly, you'll question your manhood which, on a rainy night, miles from civilization is unnerving.   I'm not really engaged. I just said that."}
