{"text":"Excellent dog, good fries and drink selection. But at $25 for lunch I can sit down at any number of great places downtown. Can get the basic dog, fries and a pop for $20. Would be 4 stars if the price was better.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a bacon (pork belly) dog :)"}
{"text":"First day, thought I would try them out. The concept is good, but the execution seems flawed. I don't really know what i was expecting - I guess that the sausage would taste a lot different from a cheap BBQ'd Toronto street food hot dog - it really didn't. They might be home made and (possibly) one would assume nitrate free, but they didn't taste that much different. Even the hot dog buns are the same as the ones you get on the street (i.e. the exactly the same - yes, that cheap-ass bread that goes soggy the moment any moisture hits it). Surely a gourmet hot dog deserves at least a home made gourmet bun to go with it? We had two hot dogs. They both came with a rather nasty creamy coleslaw that doesn't really work too well in a hot dog. A portion of fries was greasy and soggy. Tastier sauerkraut can be found in the supermarket.  Service was fine and friendly - the place wasn't busy. However, they will need to move faster when there is a rush on.  The drinks on offer are actually more appealing than the food - very decent and surprisingly varied beer selection and home made sodas.  So onto value - with tax these hot dogs are pushing $10 a piece (some are over that). Are they 3x better than some of the hot dog vendors on the street? No. More importantly - would we recommend this place or be going back? - unfortunately not.   Overall just really disappointing. I know it is the first day, but there are some fundamental misses here on the taste side of the house - the service was fine. We had high hopes for this concept, but I think we will stick with the gourmet burgers for now."}
{"text":"Went in late on Sunday. Didn't expect a lot as it was late and the end of the weekend, but I was hungry. Wow was I surprised! Ordered the Coney Island chili cheese dog and fries. Great dog and chili was well seasoned. My peach ginger ale was refreshing.  Sure, a little expensive, but the quality and flavour more than made up for it.  I'd rather be filled and satiated with good quick service food and pay for it, than filled to the brim with crap and pay only a little less.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been to Craft Dogs four times now since they first opened their doors, most recently just yesterday, and I have had a fantastic experience each and every time.   Before even getting to the food I feel it is important to mention to customer service; it is top notch! A different person greeted me at the counter on each of my visits and they all showed the same level of courtesy and professionalism. From explaining how the menu works (sausage contents are written inside parentheses on the menu board while toppings are listed outside the parentheses), to making personal recommendations, to listing ingredients in the house-made condiments, the Craft Dogs staff are always willing to help out and they do so with a smile.  As for the hot dogs, needless to say they are delicious (why else would I keep going back?). The size of the dogs are more than adequate, and as they are loaded with toppings many people will find just the dog alone a filling meal, even without ordering a side. So far I've tried three varieties: The Pork Belly BLT, The BBQ Pulled Pork, and The Mennonite Smokey. One staff member told me the BBQ Pulled Pork is their top seller, and I can see why. It's topped with a generous amount of organic pork shoulder that's juicy and prepared to perfection. It contrasts perfectly with the crunchy slaw that is found beneath the dog in the just the right amount so it doesn't overpower the rest of the flavours.  The only somewhat disappointing experience I've had was with the Mennonite Smokey. That's not because it's bad, but rather because I'm usually not  huge fan of cheese and this particular wiener contains cheese curds. I know you're probably thinking that was stupid of me to order a hot dog made with an ingredient I knowingly don't like, but I guess I was feeling adventurous. The toppings, especially the house-made kraut, were delicious, however. I'm sure most people without my weird aversion to cheese would enjoy the Mennonite Smokey Dog.  Another huge plus for Craft Dogs is that all of the condiments and sodas are house-made and incredible. The hickory ketchup is mouth watering and great for dipping fries, and the Cocoa Root Beer is my top pick among the beverages. The fries themselves are nothing special, just your standard deep fried potato slices, some spices to add some zing would be nice, but they serve their purpose.  I have seen some people complain about the prices at Craft Dogs, and there's no denying this place is expensive (a hot dog, fries, and pop will cost you around $15 - $18, and even more than that if you opt for a beer instead of pop), but considering the quality of the food and the generous portions, I think the prices are definitely worth it.   Overall I highly recommend you try this place at least once, even if you are put off by the thought of paying premium for a hot dog. If you're like me you'll be back many times. If not, at least you'll get to experience these world-class wieners just once."}
{"text":"Very solid handmade hotdogs. I got a tour of the kitchen area and it's great to know that everything is made from scratch with fresh ingredients. Skip the street meat and go to Craft Dogs instead."}
{"text":"I always make sure to stop by this place anytime I'm in the area for some shopping at St. Lawrence market. Each time I've been here, I've had a consistently great experience. Friendly and wonderful employees, cocoa root beer that is to die for (free refills), and my favorite - the pork belly BLT hot dog. The sausage is unique- very juicy and tender, and the arugula/house mayonnaise are the perfect accompaniment. I also love the bread that the sausage is served on.   I got a voucher for free fries while I was eating here once- what a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Spotted this little gem as we walked King St.! For me it would have never had been a place to try, but my glory, these aren't just hot dogs they are perfection ! Perfected by the wonderful owner Brian! My husband decided to be experimental and try the Elk Dog! The dog itself was wonderful, but elevated by the pickled blueberries and Brie cheese! I was more conservative and had the pulled pork dog, holy cow this dog was delicious ! All of the topping be it the ketchup, mustard, pickles whatever is made in house and so are the hot dog themselves! \"You got to stop and enjoy this gem!\" The staff are wonderful, they are warm welcoming, it's like you are at their home! Come and try it, you'll be back, I guarantee it!"}
{"text":"Just went to craft dogs since we live nearby...it was aweful!!!  I expect to get a lot more for my money...hot dogs from street vendors taste Soooo much better and are much more affordable"}
{"text":"Nice Clean Restaurant. I have had 3 Different Hot Dogs from here, and they are done great. A little pricier than what I thought it would be, but that was also because I walked in basically blind not knowing what was about to happen. Great taste, great flavour, cooked well, fresh ingredients. Nice staff of people. Clean tables and seats to sit on. Great Dogs."}
{"text":"I had the Kobe Carny dog with cheddar cheese. Eh. It tasted pretty meh- I wanted something more flavorful. And for almost 12 bucks, I needed it to be pretty awesome; it was just okay. The blueberry Up was delicious though."}
{"text":"I don't normally review places but I work on King and had my eye on this place for a while before it officially opened.  I stopped in after work and I can say it was my first and last visit.  First of all I was about to walk out the door after I saw the price, $12 for a hotdog??, I told myself to try it to see if it could live up to the price tag, it didn't.  I ordered the Kobe Karney dog, I was looking into getting fries but $4.50 seemed too steep and when I asked for a diet soda all they could offer me was lemonade at $5!!  The dog was dry dry dry and had what seemed like cheap canned chilli all over it.  I had the dog to go as the inside decor was rather cheap and just didn't appeal to me.   Overall very let down, if the product quality matched the price tag I would have no issues paying $12 for it, however I can get a better dog for $2.50 at a cart."}
{"text":"I effin LOVE hot dogs so when I found out that this place was opening down the street I was delighted, and went opening day.  I order the basic naked dog since I find it's just to judge a place on how the they cook something simple.  So what does a $6.50 hot dog taste like?  Not much different than one for $3 that you can get on a street corner.  The sausage was average, nothing special. The bun was a dissapointment and wouldn't surprise me if they get it from the same place your corner hot dog vendor does... it was also burnt a little. I understand that during a rush this is something that might happen to a piece of bread left over fire but the place was empty. Common guys.  The toppings were creative but unnecessarry, rhubarb this, blueberry mayo that, somekind of crab flavoured sauce. Why would I want to put \"fresh\" soaking wet mozzarella on my hotdog? The relish was good.  They didnt appear to have yellow mustard, which I am assuming isn't goumet enough, BUT they had ketchup.  While I was eating, 2 of the workers were discussing what appeared to be a sausage at the end of a long fork that one of them was holding. After some deliberation he threw it into the garbage. That's 6 bucks doooood, I could have taken the bus twice with that sausage. That sausage couldve helped me pay my phone bill last month.  I wanted to try the maple lemonade I read about but it was $5. That's five dollars for lemons and water people.  Save your time go to WVRST for a larger, cheaper, more interesting hot dog/sausage selection."}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday and I've gotta say I wasn't impressed. I didn't realize that they were such a new spot so I don't wanna fault them for being slow. But I will say that I placed my order and then went across the street to Quesada for a co-worker and after waiting in a long line over there, I came back to Craft Dogs and still had to wait for my order.   I had the Kobe Carny dog, which had Kobe beef chilli, mustard, and raw onions. First off the dog, while longer than the bun, was only about the width of my finger and I have average lady hands. It had a good snap to it but was unfortunately kinda dry. Thank goodness it had the chilli on top. The bun was nice and soft though. I also had fries, which were pretty damn good. But if the best thing I can say about a hot-dog joint is that the fries were good, well... My bill came to $16.33 for those two items, and I was willing to pay that if it was phenomenal. It wasn't. That price is ridiculous for a gourmet hotdog of that calibur and I can't justify it.  Watching my co-worker chow down on his fresh pork burrito that I paid $7 for across the street, gave me a case of the sads :("}
{"text":"It's good especially the fries, unfortunately I went yesterday and now it's closed. The sign says they are taking time to work on more dogs but that's code for goodbye"}
{"text":"This place is unique and definitely worth trying. I must say street meat tastes much better though. A combo is quite costly. I paid $17 for an Octoberfest hot dog, fries and a drink. The gravy for the fries is excellent. It contains little pieces of hot dogs!  Not sure if I will return due to the high price. I don't mind spending a pretty penny for good food but at the end of the day, it's a hot dog. Check it out at least once."}
{"text":"I really liked the hot dog I had here.  It is expensive for sure, but that's kind of the point.  \"Normal\" hot dogs are crap at crap prices.  The whole reason this place exists is to offer a higher class of product, so of course it will be more expensive.  They have very good beers on tap here, too, which is a big bonus."}
{"text":"This place deserves more recognition!  I've walked away full and thoroughly pleased on both occasions that I've stopped by Craft Dogs.   - The service is great - everyone that I have interacted with has been jovial/attentive.   - The food is amazing - I've had the pork belly dog and the duck dog. The pork belly dog was one of the ugliest hot dogs I have ever seen - all shriveled and crooked looking. However, it was decidedly one of the best hot dogs I have ever had. I die, just thinking about it. The dog dog was definitely a slightly gutsier choice on my end, and while it wasn't my favorite, I can see most foodies loving it - the mango relish it was decked in was delicious, I just wish there wasn't as much cream cheese (I think it was cream cheese? Don't entirely remember). I also love the bread that they used, which is way different from the usual grocery-store hot dog bun.  - Their home-made fountain sodas are A DREAM. Get the chocolate root beer. Please. Is it wrong for the fountain sodas to steal the show at a hot dog joint? Probably. And they would, at any other hot dog place.  - Yes, it takes more time to make, but it's not because the employees are just loafing around - the hot dogs were made on the spot, and I watched them carefully place all the toppings/etc. Talk about passion for your craft. My hot dog arrived delicious and lovingly made."}
{"text":"The burger has been done to death.  Last rites spoken by the priest.    Craft dogs is a welcome change.  Yes, it's more expensive.  Yes, it takes time to make.  Yes, it will taste different.    May I remind all of those burger-philes that the last time I checked, McDonalds takes 30sec.  to get a Big Mac done.  But the equivalent at Stockyards takes time, costs more, tastes better, and all things considering; is worth the wait.   Craft dogs, thank you for sparing me the mystery meat from the street and giving me something I had a craving for.    Naked dog, cut-fries, homemade vanilla cola - $15.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Highly overpriced (8 to 15 dollars) for an average dog. Nothing special about them. Service is slow slow slow. granted that they just opened so they have to work out the kinks still but it is a hotdog.  Restaurant is crowded and noisy. Very little space.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I will give 2 stars as the beer was nice. The hot dog was not great quality and not what I expected. Friendly staff but when your main product is hot dogs, they should be great. I really like the hot dogs at wvrst on king st west."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I have ever had.  EVER!  I went for lunch with a friend this past Friday.  I opted for the basic with kraut and mustard.  It was incredibly delicious.  First of all there is the meat--total quality here with none of that weird aftertaste you get with most hotdogs.  The skin was crunchy but the meat inside was still tender and juicy--I only wish I could grill like this at home.  But it was still a hotdog.  It would be easy to make gourmet sausages (yes, I know a hotdog is just a sausage) but this was unmistakably a proper hotdog.   The bun--soft, fresh--could have eaten that on my own.  Mustard was made in store as was the sauerkraut.   I could have eaten a bowl of the latter on its own.    Again, it is hard to emphasize this: you are eating something that is common and basic but gourmet too.  Kind of like eating a homemade, gourmet doughnut or something that is usually always created as a low quality item.  Given what you are getting, I think the price is fair.  I also had the fries.  Cut in store, crispy with a good amount of salt--pretty much everything you'd want in a fried potato.  All of the sauces were good--nothing really stood out expect maybe the home made mayo.  Tastes so much better than what you get from the jar.    The gravy you can get for the fries is really good too.  Finally I had their vanilla-cola which was excellent albeit not as bubbly as I'm used to.  (I suspect in house made pop is not normally as carbonated as the mass produced stuff)  Service was friendly.  As everything is made after you order, there was a short wait.  I love the concept and I love the final product.  Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick on the way to meet some friends.  I think that gourmet hot dog shops are going to be the next big trend in 2014.  They have a good selection of choices that I would love more opportunities to come back and try.  I tried the classic Chicago style dog.  Loved the long piece of pickle and red pepper topping that laid right inside the toasted bun so you get a piece of it each bite.  Actually since I partied so hard that night, I actually didn't eat this until the day after and it still tasted quite good!  So that is an extra bonus that this place has going for it."}
{"text":"Probably more than I needed to eat. The dog was very good. Fries even better. They have a lemon-pepper aioli for the fries that is dynamite! A little pricy perhaps. $31 for 2 craft dogs, 2 beers and one fry? Maybe not? Maybe I'm just cheap?"}
{"text":"Best hot dog i've tried but hot dogs can only be so good. My fav was the store made root beer. soooo good... Their dogs are better than street meat but about three times the price. Not sure if it's worth it to be honest."}
{"text":"Craft Dogs hosted a preview party tonight and will open to the public on Tuesday, May 28th. Should you line up for one of their haute dogs? Yes, you should.  Following what could be called a \"burger movement\" in Toronto, it seems almost natural to move on to its fast-food counterpart and give it the much-needed makeover. And Craft Dogs does just that. Imagine everything you think you know about hot dogs and throw it out the window.  First off, the hot dogs are hand-crafted and contain only natural ingredients, even the casings. Yup,  ALL-natural. Most, if not all, of the condiments and drinks (less the beer, I presume) are made in-house too. If you love your lemonade like I do, go for the simple yet why-aren't-more-people-doing-this maple syrup version.  Second, the mainstays are crazy! In a good way. Everything from duck to pork belly to kobe beef are dressed to impress. One standout is the Thai dog topped with a mango salsa, but I hear the avocado dog is equally as good.  Finally, do you work in the financial district and tire of the corporate culture trickling down into the restaurant offerings? Escape here and eat well.  Shout out to the owners Kathleen and Brian who, following the success of their now sold Beer Bistro, clearly know what this city craves in food and drink."}
{"text":"Nope, you can't get these dogs at the hot dog vendor on the street. Nope, they don't taste the same. Yup, they're more expensive and take a while to make. Think of it as a custom blend sausage, not a mass produced hotdog. And skip the Kobe dog. Most anything labeled Kobe will be a disappointment unless it's an actual Kobe steak.  Try what I had instead, the BBQ pulled pork dog. Pork belly dog, bbq pork shoulder in a too sweet sauce that needed more tang, smoked gouda, caramelized onions, and slaw on a split top bun. Seriously, can you get any of that shit at your usual hotdog vendor? If so, count yourself lucky. The pork belly dog tastes good, the pulled pork's a little too sweet, but if your mouth is big enough to get all the ingredients in one bite, it all comes together w/ the cheese offsetting the sweet pulled pork, the slaw adding crunch and the rest adding flavor.   It's a boutique hotdog joint. Adjust your expectations accordingly."}
{"text":"decor is alllllmost ok, but not really. but i go for the food anyway. so i tried their mennonite dog and it was a bit too sour for my taste, but i should have expected that since it's covered in hot mustard and sauerkraut. however, the BLT i started with was hands-down the best dog i've EVER had. ordered it with cheddar and i almost cried from how good the meat was. which is why i decided to try the mennonite dog. going to stick with the BLT from now on. seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Super delicious hot dogs with interesting meat options! The fries are also very good and I recommend the root beer! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming :)"}
{"text":"Time to update the review again.   A full four stars for sure, four and a half could work too.   I'm slowly working my way through the menu but don't always manage to catch all the seasonal specials.   The dogs/sausages are consistently excellent.  Mennonite smokey for me today - one lunch companion had the Caprese dog and another had the veggie option - Portabello mushroom.   Everything was delicious - the horseradish on my dog almost took the back of my head off - in the very best way  :)  I'm now officially addicted to the blueberry up soda.  No question.  Service superb as always.  Top-ups on the sodas offered regularly.    One of the best touches today was that the woman taking our order made sure to point out to our Friday vegetarian that the fries are cooked in duck and beef fat so he knew not to order them.  Love the Craft Dogs family!"}
{"text":"The rabbit hot dog was outstanding today! This place has the coolest ingredient and flavour combinations. It seems a little pricy until you see the generous presentation and taste the unique flavours."}
{"text":"Really, that much money for nothing then a expensive hot dog. NOT !!    Had the philly cheese dog. NOT !!     What a waist of time and money for something you can get on the Street. I thought Roger Centre Dogs were expensive, NOT !!    A mistake fore sure."}
