{"text":"I was very pleased with my experience eating at fuego! Nancy was so very attentive to my wife and I. We had the shredded beef cheese crisp. The meat was full of flavor and juicy. Crispy tortilla  with just the right amount of cheese. Hot and excellent with their salsa. And Nancy made the whole visit so pleasant. Thank you fuego and Nancy for excellent food and service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for Saturday lunch.   Had fish tacos.  Great food.  Friendly service.  Good price.  Will definitely come back and recommend"}
{"text":"In all honesty it doesn't even deserve a star. We were enticed by the name of the place and tried it out. the first impression we got was it was more of a bar than a restaurant. To put it simply, our food was smothered in the same ancho chili sauce, although we got different dishes. I couldn't even taste my enchiladas because they were masked by this sauce! Who knows what I was eating? Nothing stood out at this place but the people who were nearby getting drunk."}
{"text":"SOME DELICIOUS MENUDO, awesome tasting tacos everything was on point including the chips and salsa green red sauces... after ate dinner we order extra to go..... Yes! It was that good my wife comes from a family of a chef and cooks she loved it...."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Sat for like 10 min with no acknowledgement. The place had maybe 5 other people in it. I had to get up to ask for menus. I ordered a beer that also took another 10 min to get and my glass was completely dirty! Disgusting. The bartender was rude as hell and actually threw the plates and menus down on the table. I didn't even end up ordering food. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place great food great atmosphere. I will definitely be back. Try to carnitas burrito if you happen to come by. Bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service but the owner was very rude.  Surprised by this.  We wanted to order a drink and they had to go to the store (wow, who runs out of liquor) to get the alcohol (a shot of Patron), we waited and asked to speak to the owner, thought maybe a discount for waiting and nothing.  We asked to speak to him and he wouldn't even come to the table to speak to us, talk about a quality owner, NOT.  Poor manners of an owner.  Nice to see the owner of all people was so generous to make us wait a half hour and then not even offer a discounted shot.  We were not asking for it to be free, I will never go back, thanks to the owner."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go here by myself or with a date on a Friday/Saturday night, definitely bring backup. Not the most quality crowd but the service was good."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was cool. It is open, lots of space and I was greeted when I walked in the door. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer, the bartender was quick and checked back keeping my drink full. The chips and salsa was okay, not bad, but some good salsa would go a long ways. I ordered a red chili burrito, and it was tasty. They ran out of wings, which was crazy, because they looked good. The atmosphere was friendly. I would say if you want to enjoy a drink and some food, this place has a nice ambiance. I will go back again and follow-up on my review."}
{"text":"So far so good. Food has lots of flavor, and service was quick. Pretty empty, but it's lunch time so it's expected. Was offered a discount with yelp checkin, but this establishment no longer honors yelp deals. Kind of made me feel stupid trying to use yelp deals/probably wouldn't checkin again ."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Decent prices. Highly recommend! Came here when we were staying in the area for a concert. Would comeback if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Fast forward 6 years. The staff is new & fun. Definitely make the place. The patio in front is nice when the weather is right & is now located on Van Buren so you can watch the people. The original patio in the parking lot has been closed in to offer more tables & a larger indoor dance floor. The clientele are younger & the music more contemporary. All great improvements.   The wings were delish (we ordered the honey hot & got hot but honestly they were good & we didn't even mention the snafu). Only other wing bummer is they don't offer bleu cheese. Also good if you like the fried variety of botanas the appetizer sampler is great for sharing. Everything flavorful & the condiments good. Well... with one exception. The traditional tomato salsa was Bland. The knife cuts were far from uniform, so the white onion was too much, needed salt, more chilies just everything about it was not good. Which SUCKS for a Mexican restaurant. The green was very good. Could've used more heat but after the tomato salsa it was delish. They also do not have fountain diet soda. I hope they have sugar ones for mixing drinks but no diet. I was charged $2.39 for a can of diet Coke. They didn't even give me the whole can. Just filled it to the top with ice & kept the can behind the bar in a line with the other diet Cokes already opened (eeks). Which I was kinda ok with till I asked for more & they took a can from the other end of opened ones & said this refill was on them but I'd have to buy the next.... OK how long had that other can been there & why didn't' they tell me that when I asked for a diet Coke? Then we had some left over food we wanted to take & I got my check & they charged me .90 for a to go container... this isn't a buffet. What the heck? I will not be back to this place again to eat unfortunately. There are far too many Mexican restaurants in a 3 mile radius to deal with bad salsa, ridiculous fees & $2.39 for can of old diet Coke..."}
{"text":"Just got out of the Florida Georgia line concert at ak chin pavilion. My wife and I were starving. Found our way to fuego. The GM Diego hooked it up. Amazing tacos. Fair priced beer. I will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks/snacks on A Friday around noon. The place was dark and had way too much empty space.   We had a group of 8 so we ordered the party platter - which is a ridiculous amount of food for $40. Everything was way too greasy, while the meat was ironically pretty dry.   I also got the margarita, which came in a huge fishbowl-sized glass and was plenty strong. So come for the drinks, get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"More of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant, which was unexpected. The patrons in there were so loud and annoying I didn't even want to order. There's 2 kinds of salsa, and the green is the edible of the two. The red is just downright nasty. The chimi combo is nothing to brag about. On top of being in a sketchy area, I'll never go again."}
{"text":"We came here because we bought a Restaurant.com certificate. The food was decent. The server was very friendly. It is a bar with tables and they have a number of TVs."}
{"text":"First time here to check out the place. We couldn't use the yelp coupon that's offered here so don't bother :( Also, the server was unsure about menu items as we asked about them (our first time here)- there are no desserts available (although listed on the menu). The food we ordered was ok."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my boyfriend and another couple. They only had 1 server and 1 cook. It smelled really bad in there, like throw up. The waitress said happy hr started at 7 and I actually ended at 7 so we had a much larger tab than anticipated. Drinks were gross and had hardly any liquor. Everything was dirty, it was seriously horrible. No music no anything. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Yelp had a check-in offer of 75% off order. After being greeted by the server I informed him of the Yelp offer. He said he was new and had to check with the owner. Owner refused the Yelp ad offer. So, I am here and order the shredded beef burrito; bad call. It was a ground beef/shredded beef combo. The worst shredded beef burrito EVER. I arrived her with a 75% off offer and I am 100% sure I will never be back."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere, bartender service is top notch. Always like to stop here when in the area."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly , the place I think is under construction or so it looks like . They have big tvs , good food , full bar .  Nice private parking lot . Lots of Latinos here :) which I like .  I don't know what it says that Sunday's are closed , but it is not true . It's open on Sunday's :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the restaurant, and i got a low cost discount coupon to try it again. I'd been once when it first opened and thought I'd try again. Way too expensive, no real traditional flavors here. Couldn't enjoy a cocktail because their machine spit out flat soda, no matter what i ordered. Service was terrible, took forever to get our order in, forever to get our food. I won't go back again."}
{"text":"Not sure about all the other reviews but as for my experience coming here, it was disappointing. The place is dirty, floors never swept, the tables are all different, uneven and wobble when you sit down. They take no pride in cleaning and making sure its suitable for the next costumers. As for the food.. unbelievably greasy. very low quality and the carne asada tacos are terrible. Im not sure what theyre made of but its definitely not carne asada.. It could be a nice place but the inside looks run down and poorly taken care of. Definitely wouldnt recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here before but my last visit was terrible. Sat at a table on a week night, not very busy and never got service. Didn't even get offered a menu, not even a greeting. Really weird after not be even acknowledge that we were there, we ended up leaving after around 18 minutes."}
{"text":"The lady at the front desk of the Marriott Courtyard pointed us in the direction of Fuego, warning, \"It's a hole in the wall, but you'll like it.\" As we approach the entrance, there is a sign stating, \"The management reserves the right to refuse service.\" Good start.  Inside, it's a bar with tables along the back wall. Good news is the food is excellent! We had the usual chips & salsa, both red & green, plus an appetizer of Queso, the thick cheese swimming with anaheim or similar chiles. My main dish was the Chimi Plate, including Green, rice & beans. Inside the chimi was grilled, sliced steak. Very tasty.  Fuego had good, inexpensive Mexican fare in a hole in the wall kinda way."}
{"text":"Very nasty, plain and bland food.  Very rude staff. The owner is the worse.   Not a family place at all.   It's all a bar atmosphere.  Loud, awful music and dim lighting.  If you're thinking Fuego, save your money and go to Frys and get some frozen Mexican food.  It will taste better."}
{"text":"I'm drunk but I feel that I have a duty to rate this place! Tex-Mex hip hop! This place is not a regular hang for me but when I do stop in it seems to be very \"dude heavy\", the music always seems to be to loud and you have to yell at the person sitting across from you. I'm not really feeling this place!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot whenever I step foot in Phoenix, AZ no matter business or pleasure. The customer service was everything. I don't remember walking to my seat because they may have carried me because they are just that helpful. (JK) The food prices were excellent and happy hour is happy hour. I ordered the hot honey wings and a shrimp and chicken fajitas. Both delicious. I enjoyed every minute at this location along with meeting some of the locals and manager of the restaurant. Most definitely will be back soon"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Jason Diego Nancy and the rest of the crew All do a great job of making you feel at home. Food is always fresh and delicious especially the chips and salsa. Their menudo is awesome too. Saturday night DJ is always fun!!"}
{"text":"Ok this place was was poppin back in 2014 now it's bunk as fk, I've should of gone to Pinas not that it's better but I bet it's poppin'...I came in on Thursday only 6 peeps here on karaoke night and one girl sound like a cat in the dryer! Wtf!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Try the Chimi green chili!!! Salsa the serve with chips was fresh and delicious. Prices are fair and servings are more than we could eat."}
{"text":"Walked into awkwardness. Get greeted by staff awkwardly. Umm & it's boring.  Poorly designed room. Tables are even awkwardly spread apart. Over priced drinks. I wonder if it's ever busy."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I didn't have to give them a star. It was so loud we left without ordering. The echo just maximized the hysterical shrieking from the hyena in the front. There was no place to escape that terrible screaming that actually frightened my son and made him cry. I wouldn't go there again if someone offered to buy my drinks all night. This place says bar and grill out front, it would be better served to just say bar. It is a dive! We stopped because it looks like a restaurant, it's not. The manager was no use, the place was not clean and we didn't stay even long enough to get our drinks. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for breakfast and while she seemed to enjoy herself, I have a few criticisms.  Okay, one criticism.  I would have preferred some type of Mexican or Spanish rice, instead of little potatoes or home fries.  Also, some nice queso fresco sprinkled on the beans would have been better than the mixed blend of whatever cheeses they use.  Otherwise, everything was pretty good.  I ordered the chorizo omelet; which was a bit salty, but maybe chorizo is supposed to be salty?  My mother ordered a scramble that she enjoyed as well.  We also ordered some tamales that were easily in my top 3.  These tamales had a great flavor and a perfect balance of filling.  I think Fuego also makes their own salsas.  I tried the red and green and both were much better than what you are usually served at standard Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to try this place out so we decided to give it a try. Walked in and the bartender/manager was the only waitress on the floor at the time. So of course it took about 10mins or so to be given menus and drinks. Once the other waitress came in, we asked what happy hour specials were. Half priced appetizers, $1 off drafts and $3.75 wells. So being a sweet deal, our party of 3 decided to order items off appetizers. The food took awhile to come out, approx 20-25 mins. The food was NOT worth the wait. Once we got the check we realized the appetizers were NOT half off. They were like $1 off. We argued with the manager for 30mins that the prices were not half off. She argued that it was but with tax. Complete BS. After arguing with the manager, whipping out the calculator and pen; the prices were finally changed. Another thing about this place is that its extremely loud and theres not even music or tvs on. Our waitress apologized to us for the mishap. SAVE YOUR TIME AND APPETITE. CHECK YOUR TABS! Go to Carlos O'Briens instead, not far from this place."}
{"text":"Excited to check it out just pulled in to locked doors on a Monday night at 5pm. Kind of strange and there wasn't a sign or anything."}
{"text":"This is really a bar atmosphere but the food was really good.  My only complaint was that the waitress didn't ask if we wanted to take our left-overs home.  Before I realized it, it was too late."}
{"text":"The food was good and tasty.  We both had chicken taco salads.  The salads were pretty massive with all the fixing.  I wouldn't recommend the ranch it taste like hidden valley which means its not homemade.  There was a ton of meat in my salad which i liked because it filled me up.  The chips and salsa were fresh.  The salsa was tasty.    I give it a three star based on value and atmosphere.  While it is a bar and grill from the outside it looks trendy and cool.  On this inside however its mostly just a bar.  The food and drinks were pretty pricey also.  They overcharge for drinks like most places do which if they would put them at a decent price this place would be a great mexican place on the westside.    Overall I would probably give it another chance but we will see."}
{"text":"Me and some colleagues from work came here for lunch.  It was terrific.  Might be the best cheese enchilada I have ever had.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch/ football. Good service and would like to try more dishes. Original setting and spacious. I'm told at night it transforms into a place where you can dance for nightlife. Update: Recently came here and this time service could've been better. The waitress was very nice but came back 3 times asking for our orders to make sure she had them right. I wasn't worried about mine as she seemed to remember mine just fine as she repeated back the orders. I was wrong. The wrong item arrived and thankfully a friend offered some of her food, which I took so I don't awkwardly watch others eat while I wait for my order be corrected. Writing the orders down would've helped. Had to rush through my actual food once it arrived (correct this time) since my friends and I had to leave for a game. I decided this would be the perfect time to use the 75% off coupon offered through this app after check in but it turns its not being honored. (The coupon was too good to be true.) On the bright side I wasn't charged for the wrong plate at the beginning which a friend gladly took it."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place had dinner there with the family. We walk in and had a table right away. The service was first class always on top of what we ask for. Then the food came out I found my new fav place  Take the time to try you will be glad you did.five stars all the way"}
