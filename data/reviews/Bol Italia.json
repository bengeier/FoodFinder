{"text":"Yum, yum, YUM! I am so excited to have a great, local eatery that is not a chain! Bol Italia has really good food that is cooked fresh when you order it. The owner is an italian chef and definitely knows what he's doing. The menu is simple, yet creative, and SO flavorful!! I have had the chicken and broccoli bowl twice and the greek salad. So far, all has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"We have quickly become huge fans of Bol!  With so many chains dominating the Chandler area, Bol is a new breath of fresh air. The absolute best meatballs I have ever had, and I have a serious addiction to their Pappardelle pasta. All of their pasta is handmade daily too, which makes such a difference in the taste.

The service at Bol is great as well. I can't think of one complaint- great food, fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bol Italia is great!  I have tried a few of the menu items, and they were all delicious!  The service was great as well.  I have been recommending Bol Italia to freinds and family.  Great price for the amount of food you recieve. We will continue to go back."}
{"text":"The place
The owner took over a space formerly occupied by a Daphne's - they reworked the interior. Nice, but the tables are locked down so no skooching them together.  

The food
Very tasty soup and chicken panini sandwich. Heavy on the garlic and I was tasting it most of the afternoon, but enjoyable all the same and a good value as a combo.  

The bottom line
This place may be doomed to the same fate as Daphne's, although I hope not. We showed up unannounced with a group of 13 and totally overwhelmed their kitchen. The meals weren't coming out correctly or timely, and while the apology from the cashier/runner/hostess was sincere, people want their lunch quickly. 
Most of the dishes came out in about 30min which is well past their lunch claim \"15 min or it's free\". None of our group held them to it. There was a gentleman sitting at the table next to us that never got his food. Guys, this is pasta, salad, and sandwiches - not rocket science. 

Needless to say they MUST improve their operations since they just turned off at least 13 potential returning customers. 

I would have expected the owner, who I think was running the kitchen, to come out, apologize, and offer to buy our next lunch for free.  If he's learned anything from his time at Chipotle he has to know that you go out of your way to make the diner happy."}
