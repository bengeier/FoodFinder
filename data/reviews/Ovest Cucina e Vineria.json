{"text":"It's the perfect place for pricy and pretentious food if that's you're thing. I'm not a foodie by any means but I think that it's food that's hiked up a little bit so you can brag to your friends about it.   The service was awful with attention being given to only a certain type of patron, sort of the king west local if that makes sense.   Overall would definitely not recommend this place to anybody. Places like terroni have better food and service."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful d√©cor, and ample space. Staff is very passionate and love what they are doing. Highly recommend this place, especially if you are hosting a high profile event."}
{"text":"Visited last night with my two girlfriends for a nice dinner out. After seeing reviews online and pics of the food, we were excited to go and try this new \"hidden gem\" as some had reviewed.  Our reservation was for 8:30pm and we didn't leave until 11:00pm. This wasn't because we were having such an amazing time chatting, it's because it took forever to get our food and the service was so slow. Our server would go from table to table chatting to other patrons - it took 30 mins to get our $70 bottle of wine! The place wasn't even busy - tons of tables available. The food came and it was good but I've had better Italian at the same price point (Figo for example).  Overall I left exhausted and underwhelmed. I'd suggest finding another place to spend your Saturday night."}
{"text":"As a local in the area, disappointed. Terroni is a far better option. Ovest is empty which creates an odd atmosphere in such an open design. The food, delicious yes but simultaneously over priced and the portions are too small to warrant the price. I don't need a massive portion at all but Ovest serves very small portions. To be honest Luce across the street serves a better menu, Queen street 1 block North has more variety, Gusto around the corner has a less stuffy feel. This is an attempt to be upscale and King West cool but fails at both. It has massive potential but just needs to be a little less stuffy, more variety on the menu. Make it a little more inviting and get some bolognaise on the menu, some cool salad options, ease up on the butter sauces... Not awful just not good. I'm hoping G as a local it improves."}
{"text":"I want to love this restaurant as it would be great to have an Italian fine dining restaurant at my doorstep. After giving them 3 chances, sadly I will not be going back.   On Friday night a friend and I arrived around 8pm and easily got a seat as the place was half empty. We then proceeded to wait for over 15 minutes with a few sideways glances by a manager but no acknowledgement that we might be there to actually get a drink or eat? I had to wave him down and he sauntered over. When I asked if anybody was going to serve us he said \"oh I'm sorry I guess nobody noticed you\". Seriously???  He then brought us a taste of the wine we were questioning and it was actually quite good. Then we asked him about the calamari - if it was good for sharing and he said you don't want the calamari fritti - it's too common (wtf?), get the grilled calamari. So we did, along with the Buratta.   As I've experienced every time I've been to this restaurant the food is severely oversalted. The Buratta however was delicious with the accompanying small tomatoes etc.    Sadly the service never improved with multiple people coming over and interrupting us (overcompensating for earlier), not understanding that we didn't need anything else; trying to take our plates away too soon, etc.   It was comical watching the general manager flirt with a girl at the bar and occasionally she would stare at us as if somehow our presence was a nuisance. None of it made any sense.   Someone told me yesterday that this place is under new management but the guy that I've been referring to is not new.  So the bottom line is, don't bother!"}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW   Carpaccio di Polipo ($21) Octopus Carpaccio with Sea Urchin Bottarga, Pomegranate and Lemon Juice  12  This dish is a must for octopus lovers. The flavour of the delicate seafood was truly enhanced by the sea urchin bottarga while the sweet pops of pomegranate arils balanced out the rich umami on the plate.  Carpaccio di Pesce Spada ($20) Smoked Swordfish Carpaccio with Fennel and Orange  13  Satiny swordfish paired with sweet fennel, bright orange and a salty bite of anchovy. Pricey, yes, fancy, no, but decidedly well done.  Caprese di Tonno ($18) Whipped Bufala Mozzarella with Tuna Tartar   14  Another stellar dish. I loved the creamy mozzarella with the meaty chopped tartar, crispy sweet parsnip chips and the herbaceous basil dressing. My only criticism would be that I had wished there were some little crostini to add some textural contrast to an otherwise compilation of \"soft\" foods.  Agnolotti del Plin ($23) Agnolotti Stuffed with Veal Shank, Finished in Butter, Fresh Truffle and Parmigiano  18  Oh boy, this was absolute heaven on a plate. Perfectly al dente agnolotti with unctuous sweet meat mixed with a perfect balance of luscious butter, salty cheese and aromatic truffle. Serious perfection for pasta lovers.  N'Duja E Cipolla Pizza ($20) Mozzarella, N'Duja and Caramelized Onions  17  A beautifully blistered pizza with a nice balance of chewy and crispy bits, cooked all the way through without any soggy spots. I also loved the combination of the milk mozzarella, the spicy sausage and the sweet soft onions on top. While all of the pizzas on the menu looked fantastic, I would come back specifically for this one in a heartbeat.  Merluzzo ($34) Pan Seared Black Cod with Lentils  19  At this point, I was pretty full, but Chef Luca and our server suggested this was a really special dish to try. Simple, it was, but man, why mess with a good thing.  The cod was cooked just shy of done in the centre so that the flesh stayed moist, and buttery in contrast with the wickedly crispy skin. I also am not usually a huge fan of lentils but these were earthy without being unpleasantly starchy.  Apple Tart ($10) Frangipane with Rose Bud Apples and Caramel with Pistachio Gelato  21  I had the pleasure of meeting the talented pastry chef responsible for painstakingly crafting each of these babies by hand. The result was something to marvel at. The moist and frangipane shell was filled with sweet apple rosettes made even more tantalizing by the droplets of caramel inside. That alone would have been a treat, but the creamy pistachio gelato really added a nice nutty compliment to the frangipane and a pretty colour with the blush pink rosettes.    Chocolate Bird's Nest ($9) Chocolate Cream Ganache on a Biscotti Praline Cookie, Spun Chocolate Nest, Cinnamon and Coffee Candied Pistachios  22  This here would be perfect for the chocolate fiend at your table, but is rich enough that they'll hopefully want to share. I loved the play on textures- the luxurious ganache, the crunchy cookie, the crisp nest and the candied bite of the nuts.  Yum.  Sicilian Cannoli ($8) Red Wine Poached Pear, Pistachios, and Figs  23  I wasn't going to get this dessert too, but Luca convinced me otherwise. Cannoli are without a doubt one of my favourite desserts of all time, and Ovest's version did not disappoint. Kept simple (the Sicilian way), the cookie shell was filled with some of the most ethereal ricotta cream I've ever had. No chocolate, no candied citrus, no nuts inside- nothing else is needed when the baseline tastes like eating a sweet creamy cloud.  11  Closing Remarks:  -In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Ovest Cucina e Vineria and am looking forward to returning again soon. The cocktails I tried were both tasty, the wine list was plentiful, the space was beautiful, food was truly comforting and the service was beyond inviting. I was really impressed with Chef Luca's respect for the integrity of good ingredients as he proved that sometimes you don't need to mess with a good thing. Meanwhile, just being in his company with the rest of his friendly, passionate staff truly made me enjoy my experience even more.  25  -With such a large space, I would definitely recommend Ovest for an intimate date night, a quick glass of wine with charcuterie at the bar or of course a larger group event. No, this is not exactly cheap and cheerful Italian fare, especially if you opt more for the pricier meat or fish options rather than the pizza or pastas, but I do think it's comparable with others in the King West hood.  *This meal was comp."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant on a date while visiting Toronto. Out waiter Kevin was fantastic and the wine and food was even better. The atmosphere and style of the restaurant are very warm and welcoming. Highly recommend this place for dinner"}
{"text":"Surprised at the low ratings for this place. Came here for dinner on Friday evening and really enjoyed it. The hostess greeted us with a glass of champagne, which was a nice touch. Ordered the tuna tartar and duck appetizers, which were both great - especially the tuna. Their pizzas are good too: nice thin crust, good amount of toppings. The waiter made a good wine recommendation, which is a nice change as well. For dessert, the apple tart was really unique and fresh. Planning to go back next week so it'll be interesting to see how this places fares."}
{"text":"Here on a Tuesday, nothing short of excellent.  Tartar, Parma nest and Buffala pizza.  Dessert was the apple tart.  Lamanero primativo 2013 is what we drank.  It was terrific."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm a discerning foodie, but also a stickler for service and atmosphere and Ovest has it all! The food is authentic, you can tell as such since the staff are all native Italian (accents and all). The food besides being phenomenol is also affordable for a downtown spot, including the wine list which starts at $40 a bottle (unheard of in downtown). Highly recommend getting the Anthony D' Reginelle pasta (braised beef brisket, mushroom, light cream, truffle oil, parmigiano) - it's probably one of the best pastas I've ever had, and I've been to Italy!  The Zucchine Fritte is also really good as an app - and the portion is quite large, great for sharing. The Ovest Antipasto is also spot on as a sharing app. The pizza's here are also very good. Go here, you will leave gratified."}
{"text":"Great for a romantic dinner, bring your parents, in laws, birthday"}
{"text":"3/5! Very welcoming restaurant! We were greeted by a glass of champagne and appetizers! The pizza and black cod were average. My favourite dish was the tuna tartar. If you like places such as cibo this may be right up your alley. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Experience yourself don't listen to others. I came here when it first open, price was very high food was just ok. But when I came back after the new management food is great with reasonable price, owner is great! Me and my boyfriend enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. One would hope that a new restaurant would make up for it with good service. However, that was not the case. Our party of 4 was only given 2 menus which was strange. The server was not familiar with the menu. We had to ask for bread and had our bread plates and the basket taken away before we were done. It took a long time for the food to come out and the portions were tiny for the prices they were charging. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this on a recent visit to Toronto.   Sardines as a starter were mild and delicious, nicely complemented by bitter greens.   \"Anthony D'Reginelle\" was the best pasta I've eaten in along time, a decadent truffle-infused take on beef stroganoff.   Pizza Burrata had an entire whole burrata on top in the middle!  Menu light on vegetables, a contorni selection would be a nice addition. We skipped dessert as the choices didn't seem as creative as the rest of the menu (and we were stuffed).   Space is large, bustling, and loud. Nicely decorated and lit. A bit outside the main entertainment district so felt like mostly local patrons.   I'd come back the next time I visit Toronto just for that pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Parked in front of here to meet up with a colleague at a coffee shop. Then decided at 1pm we were hungry and decided to go inside as the patio looked very appealing, but since it was a really hot afternoon, we decided to eat indoors.  The ambiance was very striking. It looked like a high end restaurant, yet it was rustic and tastefully decorated. The bar is in the middle which gives it a unique look and the kitchen in the back is exposed so you can watch them do their magic.  I ordered the Grilled Octopus and Cuttlefish (appetizer) as my main, and had the Zuppa Di Giori (tomato bisque soup?) and my wife had the Risotto Di Giorno.  All the dishes were very tasty and the right temperature when they arrived. The presentation of the dishes were fantastic and the prices are on par for an upscale establishment.  In my opinion, this would make a wonderful romantic spot, a boys/night out and a place I could bring my clients!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with this place. Initially seated by the input screens even though there were ample open tables in the venue. Wine and food orders were taken hurriedly, and food brought before bread, despite requesting that bread precede appetizers (shouldn't that be obvious?) Half the wine menu was out of stock, which didn't inspire much confidence.  My side dish was also delayed 20 minutes, meaning in reality I ate green beans for dessert. No wonder it was so easy to get a reservation on a Friday. Should have known better."}
{"text":"Try the rapini and potato pizza with Harissa. Awesome! The salads were great. Gnocchi was near perfect but very simple tomato taste. Great wine selection and amazing service. No room for desserts as we kicked the plates clean. Large space if you are with a bigger group."}
{"text":"Great, super fresh food- sublime carpaccio and great pizza (wood oven & great ingredients). The interior is very stylish and feels welcoming. We went with 8 people for a dinner and the service was also very good. Definitely will be a repeat for us."}
{"text":"What ever you do, do NOT pass up an opportunity to eat here!  This was one of the best Italian meals that I have had in a long time, and I am Italian.  The gnocchi was to-die-for, and I can't stop thinking about it, and if you're looking for good apps, the calamari was delicious with the shrimp, and it wasn't too fried, so it was a little healthier than you'd expect, and the artichoke with mint was incredible.  The ambiance was gorgeous and romantic, and I loved the Italian authenticity, down to the limoncello digestif at the end of the meal.  I wish that I could give Ovest more stars."}
{"text":"Had their margarita pizza and pastas. Food was very good the only reason for the 4 star is the service was rather slow."}
{"text":"Trendy but cozy ambience in an open concept restaurant.  Great wine selection. Good for a date or group of friends. Service was friendly and sommelier was knowledgeable. Overall Recommendable!   Food that we liked:   Gnocchi con astice - tasty black ink pasta with lobster. Didn't taste like what I expected but it was yummy   The pasta dish with the dried tuna (?) - very flavourful!   The dessert with a chocolate nest - beautiful dessert, and the finely spun next melts In your mouth"}
{"text":"This is not your usual Toronto Italian restaurant. It's as if the menu was plucked right out of the heart of Sicily. Owner, Marco Celio, formerly of Buca and Buonanotte, and Sicilian-born Chef Luca Stracquadanio, once executive chef at Terroni LA and Toronto restaurant La Bettola di Terroni have created an Italian enclave that is refreshingly unique within the sea of pasta in which we are drowning. Where else would we find linguini with pistachio pesto and tuna bottarga or, my favourite, homemade black squid ink gnocchi with a generosity of fresh lobster?  Choosing between the two Carpaccio items would be an exercise in futility, so we share both. A canvas of octopus Carpaccio is splashed with pesto, and crowned by rich morsels of sea urchin. A rarity in Italian restaurants, this is a sharing-sized portion that is as delectable as it is artful. In-house smoked swordfish drapes over fresh crisp fennel. A citric essence of oranges and decorative sprinkling of pomegranate seeds compliment its buttery texture. For pairing, the in-house sommelier recommends a Sella e Mosca Vermentino from Sardegna. He calls his wine cellar \"the cave of wonders\". Showcasing Italian wines from north, central and south, we enjoy discussing each selection.  Manager, Emanuele de Donno, runs a tight ship as he stewards this three-week old restaurant, and irons out the evening from one end of the room to the other. There is no bread service, he tells us, unless we ask for it. Why? Because there are some dishes that simply do not pair well with bread. We agree. The delicacy of the Carpaccio, for example, needs to be savoured on it's own.  As the buzz of the evening crowd rolls in, the spacing of the tables and the cutting edge design of the room maintain an ambience conducive to conversation. Waiters whisk by with racks of wild boar, and rabbit stuffed with porcini and speck. The pizza oven churns out thin crusts, while a salumeria offers a selection of charcuterie and cheese to pair with wine. (On Fridays and Saturdays after 11pm, wines ordered at the marble counter are accompanied by a complimentary charcuterie selection.) Our pasta dishes are elegant and sophisticated but earthy and natural. It is just really good food"}
{"text":"Wow, I had such a phenomenal experience with OVEST this weekend. I don't typically take the time to write out positive reviews unless a place was extra special, which it certainly was. I have worked in the service industry for years so I tend to hold service to a higher standard than others. On top of that, my family and I were celebrating the nuptials of my closest friend and his now husband, so I was pretty nervous about trying a new place. To make matters more difficult, there were over 20 of us, none of whom wanted to do set menus which is often the norm with large parties. They went out of their way to allow us to order a la carte and let me tell you, OVEST DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Our server, Daniel, was knowledgeable, efficient and beyond warm. He never made us feel rushed and even took a moment to honor my friend and his new hubby with a lovely cannoli dessert! The manager, Sophia, bent over backwards to make any and all adjustments and always followed up with me professionally when making arrangements. I am truly blown away by the excellence of service, quality of food and exceptional bang for your buck at this reasonably priced Italian eatery. Well Done OVEST, I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. A little too salty, but not horrible. The waitress was fantastic though. They had a live band.... not so good.  They were ridiculously loud.  The bass was so loud, it was actually very painful to listen to. It was louder than a club! No one could have a  conversation,  it was terrible.   So many people complained to the owner,  but he didn't care or do anything about it because it was his friend's birthday. No one asked to turn it off,  just turn it down a little.  Just for that alone, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could love this place more as it is the neighborhood restaurant. Every salad they have has some kind of sweetness to it - it would be nice just to have a salad with no pears or figs. The branzino is very fishy tasting and although I asked for no oil, my plate was covered in oil. The cavatelli has so much sausage on it they could do with a little less sausage and a little more flavor. The service is average. Inside the restaurant is quite nice, nicely decorated. Food is just mediocre and in this city with so many great restaurants it's hard to go back there and I've been 3  times now and each time I say let me give it one more chance and now no more chances - just not tasty enough"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, proper service. Food was okay. Fancy small portions and very over priced for what you get. Overall I'm glad I tried it but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Suggested by a friend who grew up in the area. Food was AMAZING, loses a star for terrible service. Went on a Monday night, just a few tables, and our waitress kept apologizing for being so busy. Water wasn't refilled once and my fianc√©'s entree was spicy! The Anthony D pasta was unreal (probably best I've had and I hail from NYC), fried calamari was great as was the house bread, and my cocktail was delicious. Will be back and hopefully the service is better."}
{"text":"After being quoted an hour wait time at Gusto and wanting Italian, Ovest was our backup option in the area as they took reservations. With the mixed reviews and an intriguing menu, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the food here.   My coworker and I shared the mushroom pizza and the chitarrine (similar to a thin spaghetti) pasta. The pasta was pretty good - it was a great portion size and had plenty of large shrimp, calamari, and some small scallops (seafood depends on market availability of the day). What I really enjoyed though was the pesto sauce - it was creamy and coated the spaghetti like pasta well. I wish the pesto was stronger though. The pizza disappointed me a bit - truffle and mushrooms is my favorite combination. Unfortunately, there was a lack of truffle oil and the goat cheese on this pizza was overpowering / overwhelming. I wish I requested to have this off.   My other coworkers enjoyed their orders of the margarita pizza, salads, and the anthony pasta. It's not a bad option if you're in the area and want Italian food - the menu is extensive and the wines are affordable. We had 2 bottles of red, which were good. The breads they start you off with is good - I loved the soft focaccia and the roasted garlic they gave you to smear on the breads."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place so many times and have under estimates the cuteness and the romantic appearance from the inside!! What a nice date spot!!!  Service was fantastic from the hostess, to our server to the owner who came by to ask how everything was.   We started with the beet salad (which I didn't try),  the marinated octopus which was my fav and the beef tartare which had a really nice flavour. For my entree I had the sea bass which was prepared nicely - really flakey, a bit salty but overall really nice. And finally...that creme br√ªl√©e....that thing was fabulous. I almost regret getting it to share. ;)   Would definitely return to this gem!"}
{"text":"Returned, and shall return again, and again. I have found my Italian go to restaurant. Excellent food (I am particularly fond of the spaghetti with clams, and the grilled calamari with shrimps), but everything is stupendous (with my family, over ordering of items afforded me the luxury of trying virtually every dish).  Our experience was further enhanced by the stellar service and the ability to reserve through OpenTable for our party of ten! [Aside: my pet peeve with OpenTable is the inability to reserve for a party larger than four at many establishments. I find this peculiar and annoying. This isn't an issue with Ovest and OpenTable.]"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience overall. Upon entrance we were greeted with a glass of champagne and a bite size carpaccio.   The food was delicious: Agnolotti Del Plin (made in-house) which is buffalo ricotta and swiss chard stuffed angolotti in butter sauce and black truffle   Griliata Mista (great for sharing) 1/2 lobster, tiger shrimp, scallop and calamari grilled to charred perfection.   Modern decor and elegant atmosphere. The service was very attentive and timely."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the server was extremely friendly. I really enjoyed the Gamberi Callemeri appetizer."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, around 9:30pm. Good service and friendly staff, d√©cor was on point.  Unfortunately, my partner's pasta (the gnocchi)  was filled with multiple entire cloves of garlic.  The cocktails ordered did not resemble their namesake nor taste appealing. One was a martini (called Ceylon or something along those lines) that tasted mostly like syrup (could not even taste the vodka); the other one was most likely the worst whiskey sour I've had - tasted just like lime? Was expecting much better for a place with such high reviews."}
{"text":"Tried Ovest for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday. We are both very impressed! Amazing interior design, very tasty arugula salad and complimentary bread! Ordered one pulled chicken and one sausage pizza... SO good! They don't skimp on toppings and cheese, and the crust is perfect. Courteous service as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ignore the reviews that say that this place is overpriced and the portions are too small. My experience was the polar opposite. Maybe the management read the reviews and stepped up. The service was lovely and very attentive. We shared a mushroom white pizza as an appetizer and it was HUGE and very tasty. I ordered the pappardelle  pasta with pork ragu and it was amazing. Melt in your mouth, beautifully presented with fresh grated parm cheese and a generous portion. My husband had the gnocchi with Buffalo mozzarella and I tasted it- little pillows of goodness! For dessert I had the cannoli which were perfect and my husband had the tiramisu. It came \"deconstructed\" which was kind of unnecessary but the flavour was great.  We also went with the servers wine recommendations and were very happy with what we got. Overall I would certainly return here and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"My goodness was the pasta ever so fresh. I had the Anthony D' Reginelle (braised beef brisket, mushroom, light cream, truffle oil, parmigiano). I can honestly say it was the tastiest pasta dish I've ever had. The pasta itself was clearly made in house, thin like layers of lasagna, but plentiful and smothered in a light cream sauce. The beef was perfection and just the right amount mixed in with the dish. The woman serving our table had an exceptional amount of advice about wine, especially Portuguese wine. She was attentive, made excellent recommendations and overall enhanced the experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had dinner here a couple of weeks ago, and we loved it. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Everything from the food to the service was perfect. I couldn't decide between pizza or pasta, but eventually settled for pasta. I got the Anthony D' Reginelle and I wasn't disappointed. It was creamy, and the pasta and beef brisket were cooked to perfection. Also had the creme brulee for dessert which was made the way it should be. The ambience is great for either a date night or a nice dinner with friends. Lots of chatter and laughter in the air. Just good vibes all around. I would certainly come back here again!"}
{"text":"on a Saturday night, some friends of ours decided to find a new venue, and what better place than Ovest.  Located just west of Bathurst street on King, Ovest is a beautiful Italian restaurant that's serving up some good cooking.   Upon waiting for our tables our entourage were provided some Prosecco in a designated area prior to being seated at our tables.   The ambiance is surrounded by walls of wine bottles, contemporary fixtures with a rustic feel/ twist to it.  At the back, is a perfect view of the open concept kitchen where chefs are cooking a storm. For the works we ordered two pizzas, margaritas which was their basic rated at a 3.5. Secondly their eggplant with feta which had big slices of eggplant and was a lot more delightful than the margarita. Their choices of wines were great as we ordered glasses of chianti. Overall the place has a great ambiance and you're definitely paying for it lol no bones about it. However if you love picture taking, you'll have plenty of spots to choose one."}
{"text":"Not sure why the previous comments. Came here and had a wonderful experience. THIS PLACE is awesome!!!! Wine,Prosecco and Drinks that my group ordered was superb. The food, excellent. And the service even better. Very attentive from the moment we walked in. Those who maybe had not a great experience should really come back. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment! I booked this restaurant due to the great reviews as I did a lot of research to find a foodie worthy Italian restaurant for a special birthday on King West. We wanted to try a new place as we have already been to most of the highly rated restaurants in the area. I ordered a pasta with seafood. The server said that the seafood included shrimps, scallops and calamari. When the dish came there were no scallops so she took it back to the kitchen to exchange it. That was great. When it came out the second time, there were scallops or rather miniature size pieces that were very fishy and inedible. I started to eat the pasta and could smell  that it was \"off\" and it was very salty.  My stomach was not happy. The waitress offered me another dish but by this point I wasn't even hungry anymore and I had already made 1 trip to the ladies room. I was disappointed that my special night was not what I had planned. The others in my party said they were also not very impressed by their meals and would not go back. The server was sweet but not very experienced. We had to wait for fresh pepper and parmesan as she didn't offer them on her own. I did receive a complimentary piece of tiramisu which was good. The restaurant is nicely decorated but the noise level was really high even though we were in a corner."}
{"text":"Awesome, great staff. Menu to please all tastes. Highly recommend for groups or a date night."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times, once at the bar. The food is amazing. Chef Luca is the best! The service is amazing. I love that most of the staff speak Italian. Everyone is very warm & welcoming. The wine selection is great. Food was slow to come to table but we weren't in a rush. Overall, a wonderful dining experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We live nearby and were excited to see this place open. The place looks great. The service was OK,  but a little over attentive, with the waitress and bus boys coming by every couple of minutes (and reaching across us for items) . Food is pricey and portions are small,  we left hungry. Menu is limited -  e.g. no salads. The food was good,  we enjoyed our pasta dishes and we shared an antipasto -  but again they were small and unspectacular for the prices. As locals we hoped this would be a regular place for us, but don't see that happening."}
{"text":"Ovest is a restaurant I was truly looking forward to trying soon after it had opened, but it fell a little short for me. The food wasn't faulty or poor quality, I just found it a little less exciting than I expected. The pizza was well done and the crust was perfectly blistered, but we also ordered a wild boar chop, ravioli and dessert. The meat was fresh and well-cooked but the accompanying sauce seemed a little blas√© and the vegetable medley was uninspiring. The pasta dish was good, but not as exciting, flavourful or unconventional as I'd hoped. The cannoli was good, but again, nothing extraordinary. Given the neighbourhood, my anticipation and relative to the price, I found Ovest to be just ok."}
{"text":"Do not go! Pretentious, slow, complicated, and empty! Contrary to what Mark G. wrote, I am a \"King West local\" resident who lives on the same block, and i wouldn't recommend this place. Service is terrible, and very slow because the staff are on their cell phones all the time. Presumably the chef is too, because it takes an hour to get food, even when you are the only table in the house. Presentation is nice, but small portions and no wow moments. It's all window dressing."}
{"text":"Ovest has a modern decor that is comfortable, with heavy usage of wood and earthy tones. It is a great place for groups or for intimate dates. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit out of the way for me...but good food is worth traveling for!  I don't really consider it \"fine dining\", but the food here is excellent, and the price point is just right. The \"Anthony D'Reginelle\" pasta dish was perfect, with briased beef, mushroom and light cream and truffle - highly recommended. Their tirumisu is light and very yummy...I could have 5 of those!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place for a date. Their food menu is Petit but it is all the same delicious. You both can order what you want, or share a pizza, or try to re-create the lady and the tramp scene.   The reason why I gave a 4/5 is coz I ate there a part of a birthday event. There were 14 of and instead of trying to set tables together they just seperated us. This was planned a month in advance so they had plenty of time to prepare.  Felt weird how the birthday girl's friends were divided into 2 seperate tables. Plus if I need to be picky, I was waiting at the table for 10 minutes before someone asked if I wanted water or anything to drink while I'm waiting.  Anyway whether it be a romantic dinner, or a small gathering, this place is good!  Btw, had the truffle mushroom pizza. Very tasty even when compared to the calabrese  and duck pizza."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance,  decor and very friendly server,  mediocre food but waited TWO HOURS FOR OUR MAIN ENTR√âE. The owner or manager came to check up on us when the bill came and acted dumb like he didn't know we waited that long.  Just own up to it that woukd have been better.  Maybe a little racist too,  since they (managers or owners) personally served everyone else's table except for ours.  First time and definitely the last... Too bad cuz we live so close and the only reason why we came because we always pass by it."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant! The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Great vibe and amazing service. Shoutout to Mattia for being exceptional at his job and for being incredibly friendly!  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of 10 for a birthday party. The service was quite slow. I had the salmon which was not very well seasoned. The avocado sauce tasted funny. I think it's because they were not ripe. We decided to order dessert but the wait time was long again. Overall the food was mediocre and the service needs work."}
{"text":"Modern Italian cuisine and fine wines are bountiful at the King West, cantina-inspired, Ovest restaurant.  This cozy 120-seat space offers high ceilings, an illuminated bar, wine display, industrial flair, dimmed-hanging lighting and an extensive food and drink menu to take your palette on a tantalizing journey.  The menu is categorized into antipasto, salumi e formaggi, pizza, pasta, main dishes, sides and desserts.  Executive Chef, Danylo Mielnik, creates authentic Italian dishes with innovative twists using local and seasonal ingredients.  He has added some excellent additions to the already vast menu and I recently attended a media preview dinner to try some of it out.  Tartar di Manzo - raw beef, caper, olive, shallot, arugula, egg, parmigiano  Fragola e Basilico - strawberry, baby spinach, basil, local ricotta di bufala, pistachio  Caprese di Tonno - raw albacore tuna, local mozzarella di bufala, basil pesto, crispy caper  Cavatelli - hand cranked semolina pasta, n'duja, rapini, garlic, pecorino  Gnocchi al Pomodoro - hand rolled potato gnocchi, Barese cherry tomato sauce with local ricotta di bufala  Giardino - San Marzano tomato, fior di latte, basil, spinach, roasted red pepper, ricotta salata  Merluzzo - B.C. black cod, sweet pea puree, confit cherry tomato, squid ink  Porchettina - 24-hour sous vide Niagara pork shoulder, porchetta spices, beet and fennel pur√©e  Cr√®me br√ªl√©e,Tiramisu, Sicilian cannoli filling, Nutella mousse and Amarena cherries with puff pastry twists  The highlights for me were the caprese di tonno, cavatelli, gnocchi, and tiramisu.  The caprese was an interesting take on the regular caprese salad.  The fresh tuna with basil pesto really made this dish refreshing and light. It was easy to eat and a perfect start before the main dishes.   The cavatelli and gnocchi were both really well-done pasta dishes.  The fresh pasta and sauces were evident in texture and flavour and every ingredient came together fabulously.  I really loved the spice in the cavatellii thanks to the n'duja.   The dessert we had was quite extravagant! The pastry chefs went all out and decided to create the dessert items right on the table.  The live dessert making was impressively entertaining and beautifully orchestrated.  It was almost too pretty to eat but I really mowed down on the fresh and creamy tiramisu.  My least favourite dish was the black cod.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I have had many amazing buttery black cod dishes before but unfortunately this one seemed a bit overcooked and lacked flavour.  All of our dishes were paired with some fantastic vintage wines which really made the whole dining experience come together perfectly.  I had a wonderful time at Ovest and am really glad I discovered this Italian gem.  Ovest makes the perfect dining experience for those looking for a cozy ambiance with absolutely fresh and flavourful Italian cuisine and an array of exclusive wines."}
{"text":"Amazing food, love their pizza, and an incredible wine selection. Fairly pricey so keep that in mind but a good experience overall."}
{"text":"We came here for an event - the drinks and the food were amazing, and the people who work at Ovest are so friendly!  This definitely means I need to come back with friends for dinner and drinks! (AKA another review will be in order...I imagine they will further impress me and my tastebuds!)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. Great service, delicious wine, incredible pasta (with gluten free option), and beautiful appetizers. It is great for both dates and large groups. The inside is beautiful. The fresh roasted garlic with the bread was unbelievable. Amazing experience. Will certainly be back next time in Toronto."}
