{"text":"Really good food & a nice atmosphere, very home-y!!!! Seating is very limited tho, not great for groups any larger that 3/4 people."}
{"text":"Three of us had a lovely brunch on the patio (eggs benedict, veggie dog, and perro loco [huevos rancheros]).

The food was lovely especially the perro loco! Our waitress was very nice. The only caveat was that the regular coffee was quite bitter but maybe we got a bitter jug since our free refills were better.

Excellent value for money!

We will definitely be back here :)"}
{"text":"Mad Dog Cafe is a perfect little place with friendly staff and great espresso.  It's perfect because its never over-crowded and the atmosphere is warm.  It feels good to support an local, independent business owner!

Mad Dog not only offers a great selection of coffee and teas, they also have sandwiches, bagels and baked goods.  From what I could see, the food looked pretty tasty.  I believe that they source most of their ingredients, baked goods and bread from other local businesses - which is always a bonus!

It's a great place to visit in the summer as they usually have the garage-style doors open for street view.

The two reasons I can't give it 5 stars...they don't have skim milk :( ...and the ventilation where food is being prepared is not ideal. 

BTW - they are cash only.  Not good either."}
{"text":"Mad Dog Cafe is nestled amongst a row of eclectic houses and shops  just across the street from the local beer store.. Inside, it hosts wonderful staff, gorgeous furniture and a garage style door to have your favourite beverage el fresco on a fantastic Toronto sunny day. 

The grinds are local - Toronto and Dundas (of all places!). 

Service is great.  Atmosphere is lovely.   Cash only."}
{"text":"gave it a try many times since they look good and really close to my house - would have been ideal coffee place. Except their americanos consistently feel weak - i ask for double, in small cup, with less water.....and still feel watery. No more for me"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for an excellent and reasonably priced Americano. Everyone that I saw come in complimented the barista/owner(?) on their food and drink and I did the same. Great atmosphere and conveniently located 50 feet from the Carlaw/Gerrard dog park."}
{"text":"Mad Dog is a comfortable and relaxed space in a corner of Chinatown that is seeing signs of new life. The large and open cafe gains its charm from the refinished church bench, old stove, and teak furniture accents. As evidenced by the small collection of toys and appropriately-sized munchkin table at the centre of the room, families are welcome here.

I stood at the cash, debating on what to order. With Montreal-style bagels, sandwiches, and Kawartha Dairy ice cream on the menu, you're likely to find something that would suit. The one anomalous item that caused me to hem and haw at the cash: the bulgogi sandwich. It seemed strange to see this Korean staple listed, and irresistible because of its oddity. Of course I ordered this, with a side of kimchi to boot.

As my food was being prepared, I claimed a seat at a low end-table in the corner fronting the open front windows. Despite the shades of grey mottling the sky, the rain had been reduced to an occasional sprinkle, and the mugginess of the afternoon was tempered by a cool breeze. The sandwich arrived and is about what you'd expect - thinly-sliced beef saut√©ed with onions on greens in a fresh bun. The kimchi was also fairly standard, but kickier than I'd have expected.

To finish off my meal and loiter with my book, I got a cappuccino and a cookie. The cappuccino was really well-done and a nice way to wrap things up. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The first thing I felt when I walked in here was fear. The fear that comes when going for a lazy quiet saturday morning coffee and being greeted with a row of children's toys. Some places should just not be kid-focused. Some places need to remain for adults, a place where you can swear in a conversation with friends or talk about the awkward sex you had the night before and not get side glares. A place where you can enjoy a coffee and a book without the background noise of screaming children. Bars and cafes - it's all we have left. Why take those away from us??

Other than the kiddie clutter, Mad Dog was nicely designed. Though they seem to be more diner than cafe now - between all the breakfast foods and the children gear.

I had a great latte. Though I had it to go, running out the door, away from the loud child voices. Anytime on a saturday morning in a cafe is too early for me to deal with that!"}
{"text":"Good food and great value. The only improvement I would suggest is that the ventilation was improved in the colder months. When they cook breakfast you come out of there smelling like you work at a diner."}
{"text":"Ordered Cuban sandwich which is not really good. Lack of flavor. Dry pork. Disappointing bread.
But I love the overall environment here. It is just so local. The chair close to the big window is super comfy. I will probably come back to order a cup of tea and get some work done."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times. 

The breakfast is delicious, but it's always busy so be prepared to wait for a bit. 

Have also been for lunch. Perogies are delicious. Their paninis are great too. 

Would definitely recommend, it's my go to place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Recently visited Toronto and my nephew took me here for brunch on a Saturday. Unfortunately, being a raving fan of Mexican food and from the San Francisco area, I sometimes forget that when I travel to other parts of the world, one's interpretation of Huevos Rancheros will vary. With that being said, it was definitely prepared not what I was accustomed to.  The coffee was a heavy dark roast coffee - almost like an Americano and was more bitter than what I was accustomed to. In the end, I grew accustomed to the taste as it did the trick of waking me up.

My nephew ordered the usual Mad Dog Breakfast with the country style bacon and in hindsight I should have ordered that since that was what they are known for.

I would give this place another shot as there were a lot of regulars who came here when we were having breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches in the world...also amazing americanos!"}
{"text":"Popped in for my first stop of the second Indie Coffee Passport. A cortado wasn't on the menu, but I asked the barista (Stefanie) if should could make one, and she said \"sure\".

Then, in a move that I felt was quite clever, she asked me where I usually drink my cortados.  She's quite familiar with many of the other coffee shops, and realizes that, as with every other espresso-based drink today, there are various ways to make them, and everyone thinks their way is correct.  After discussing this, she made me a mighty fine cortado, apologizing that it wasn't in the traditional glass.  (No problem, it wasn't on the menu after all.)

She was friendly and down-to-earth, and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Part of the Indie Coffee passport this is a surprising find in this area. The setup is quite nice it was packed with weekend brunch crowd. It was noisy though with some kids running around but I am guessing they quiet down on weekdays. 
They had plenty of baked goods which were quite tempting but purpose of my trip was try the Cappuccino here.
I ordered a double cappuccino with a sweetener. The barista picked up a glass mug which was kept nice and warm the way it is supposed to be.
Latte art was OK and I think it would look better if a different cup was used.
Milk could use little more frothing. Espresso itself was nice and mellow.
3 stars for drink and 4 Star s for the setup.
Will repeat."}
{"text":"It's a great little place and I like the owner, can't get a nicer hard working guy. This place keeps screaming potential but never quite seems to reach up and grab it.  I would like to say not much has changed here however this would not be the case. I know this is going to sound negative but it is not. I've been here at least 20 times, I'm just speaking from my experience. They no longer offer table service I have just been informed. They don't bring you water and you have to pay for your food before your food comes.  I wouldn't think it was possible, the service has actully worsen now that they have two wait staff up from one. My breakfast arrived 35 minutes wait from the time I arrived. The well done sausage I requested were overdone badly chard and the beans were cold. That's better than the cold home fried potato's I've grown accustomed to here.  The place wasn't busy, a lot of people on computers taking up space forcing me to sit at the communal bar to eat. Seems like coffee drinkers get priority over food orders. I was a regular here for a while but with the poor service, inconsistent food and lack of air conditioning. I have moved on. I keep popping in once in a while in hopes that they have improved. Only because Jims closed on Queen Street, I thought I would give it a re-try. I wish I stayed home."}
{"text":"I just moved to a house around the corner and we have managed to do more than two brunches with a newborn baby. It's a great place to enjoy a yummy breakfast on a weekend or sit back with an espresso on a weekday. Has a quiet and relaxed retro vibe.

Their sandwiches are pretty good and I really like their coleslaw (which is their own recipe). I see myself spending quite a few afternoons there."}
{"text":"Skip the line at lady marmalade and head over to mad dog cafe for a really great breakfast. Cozy feel inside, good service and yummy food. The potatoes are cooked just like latkes. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"For a busy brunch spot, they should have more than two servers up and running, especially as they make coffee to order and serve baked goods to go. The menu is very basic, simple breakfast/brunch fare at reasonable prices and good portions. I really liked the interior of the restaurant as it evokes that \"homey\" feeling (perhaps the elusive \"hygge\") that some places lack."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch menu. Always leave really full! Delicious pastries and custom coffees made to order on the antique espresso machine make this a perfect hangout to enjoy free wifi and people watch on the patio."}
{"text":"Taste with your Nose.  That's my First-hand experience at Mad Dog Cafe.
Open the doors to this Diner-esque Cafe. Immediately I can taste Eggs, Fried Eggs.
It came via Nasal bombardment as the full space envenloped in Eggy smellness.
Mind you it was someone else's Fried Eggs but the aroma was intensive.   2.5'd

Mind you again, that most Cafes I grew up in HK offers the same Foodstuff.
Western Breakfasts, actually you would call it Western only if you're in the East.
Sandwiches, in the East you'll get Luncheon Meat, here you get Smoked Meat.
Not like North American terminology of Cafe which mostly serves Coffee Bevvies.

Being in an Asian community, I can see glimpse of how MD Cafe came to be.
As a Cafe, my Single-shot Cappuccino was weak but not the worst of the bunch.
HK-style Cafe hiding beneath a Western facade within a North American Chinatown.
As a Diner, I see a relaxing comfortable neighbourhood chowspot.
Bring your Newspaper.  Put your feet up.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"So I was heading to a job interview and got dropped off on Logan Ave. I had never been to this part of town and was a bit concerned. All I saw was a ton of graffiti and a Beer Store. Thanks to Yelp, one single coffee shop showed up on the map. Mad Dog Cafe! 

The ratings were very high but I didn't really have a choice. I had to wait two hours for the job interview (I always arrive very early). I walked in and was really pleasantly surprised.

Atmosphere - This place has a mix-feeling of a cafe and a diner. Fro the area it's in, it could have been a bit more run down and I still would have liked it. But they keep it nice and clean with a bit of style. Music is Neil Young and easy rock. Not too loud or to quiet.

Service - The customer service is very nice. Sort of feels like the same service you get in a small town. Personal and friendly.

Coffee & Food - Fantastic! And I don't drink coffee. I needed it today. But I also tried a muffin and their gluten free / wheat free POW cookie. Very good. 

Wi-Fi - Very strong and easy to connect to without any drops.

I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to stop by Mad Dog Cafe. BUT if I'm in the area, I'm so happy it's here. And if I get the job, well I'll be here all the time. And I'd love to call it my neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this cafe for about 2-3 years now. There are other places closer to where I live, but I love the vibe at this place. Their coffee is great. The staff is very nice and courteous. And the Mad Dog breakfast has been a staple for me whenever I am near by in the morning."}
{"text":"Good place to eat however the service is pretty slow. 25 minutes to get a coffee and another 20 waiting for our food. It wasn't busy, there were 3 tables inside and 1 outside filled with hungry and thirsty customers. Hire more staff or as other breakfast spots open over the coming weeks you may lose customers. The area is getting busy with new businesses. I wouldn't want to see this place get lost in the shuffle."}
{"text":"Once in a while when I am walking to or from somewhere on Gerrard I will stop by Mad Dog for a drink. It is a piece of shiny gold in a large lump of rough ore--which is to say this breakfast/brunch diner is the only sign of activity in this city block that since childhood as i remembered has been a commercial dead zone, especially since Hammersmith's across the street closed (unless you count the grimy Beer Store).

Obviously much attention has been put into making this place a community hub, with an inviting unpretentious atmosphere, a garage door frontage that opens up on the warmer months, warm staff and even a smaller table and some toys for the little ones. Much like the Rooster Coffeehouse up on Broadview, an eclectic mix of tables and chairs adds extra personality to a place I can imagine sitting around in forever if only time and life allows. Heck, this is the kind of place I'd imagine the Dan Mangan track \"The Indie Queens are Waiting\" describes.

Standard western breakfast and coffeehouse fare are served here, and for the value you get a big-ass well-prepared meal with a lot on the plate. A breakfast dish comes with a generous serving of baked beans, slices of bread from St John's Bakery, fries, breakfast meat (sausage or bacom)... holy smokes it's a lot. Crazy. Arrive hungover with an empty stomach and leave happy and awake. 

Mad Dog currently stands out as the only breath of life in a sad stretch of east-end Toronto. Thank goodness their presence is a much-welcomed friendly one. Too bad they only open until six pm.

{TTC: take the 506 to Gerrard and Logan Streets.}"}
{"text":"Came in the afternoon for brunch. No tables. Sat at the bar. Our orders were taken. 30 minutes later we got a table. 45 minutes later our meals came. Who knew brunch could be such a SLOW endeavour? The food was good, but my hash browns were way undercooked in the middle. Please hire more cooks. And your clothing will probably stink like a diner after. Their kitchen has no ventilation. Nice staff though!

Editing this review because I went back and the food was excellent. Service was fine but nothing impressive. Ask for the hash brown well done."}
{"text":"My favourite in the area! Great coffee and even better brunch. Best brunch menu item is the Perro loco, which is basically huervos rancheros."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am pretty much a regular. This is a great breakfast or lunch place. The service is fast enough to takeout during lunch hour at work. The huevos is always a favourite. Their soups are homemade and delicious. They have Montreal bagels! They always make yummy cider in the winter that people rave about. Its my favourite little local."}
{"text":"Based on good reviews on Yelp, my partner and I decided to give Mad Dog a try. I liked the casual artsy ambiance and the pleasant staff. The food, once it came, was delicious and nicely presented. I had the eggs Benedict and my partner had the \"mini dog\" (eggs, sausage and bread). That said, it took a very long time for our order to arrive (at least half an hour) and the place really wasn't that busy. Because of that, we are not likely to return."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast delicious fresh food do your stomach some good and eat here often!"}
{"text":"I own a house close by and have stopped in a few times for coffee. Always friendly ad attentive service, coffee is made fresh and the environment is nice."}
{"text":"I came to this Cafe to meet someone for the first time for business. While I was waiting for my BLT bagel and coffee I took a look around and noticed that this Cafe was one of a kind. I took some pictures of course. The waitress was nice and delivered the food and beverages after taking my order from the counter. I was surprised at the service, it is definitely separate from Starbucks and this is a great thing. Independent coffee shops like this is what coffee drinkers like me strive for. 

It is located in an area where you wouldn't think a place like this exists. When in need of a meeting place, I can tell this is the best place to meet if you were around the vicinity. 

Mad Dog Cafe is quiet enough to have a good conversation with someone without distraction. It is a nice calm environment that is intimate enough to get to know someone, and for business opportunities. It is very welcoming to their customers. Also, a very good BLT bagel... simply amazing. The coffee was good."}
{"text":"Tasty beverages and super-friendly service makes this a good place to stop for coffee I had both an americano and a cappuccino. The americano was fairly average, but the cappuccino was delicious. The Montreal-style bagels were very good and I'd recommend them. 

The decor is a little kitschy, but very charming and it suits the place. This is a neat area and it's really interesting to see new businesses (that are actually worth going to) pop up. This one's worth a visit, for sure."}
{"text":"I walked in and saw all these child friendly tables and chairs... oh and toys but luckily no kids or toddlers.

My cappuccino was one of the Meh one I had... milk was not frothed properly and resulted in a fail attempt of latte art....

Barista is way too indifference and way too laid back... I know I use a Indie Coffee Passport and not offering one of the those sandwiches...

Mad Dog Cafe does carries baked good from neighbourhood bakeries their cupcakes are from Desmond and Beatrice down on Queen and Broadview look quite delicious though...

Mad Dog Cafe is set up more like a diner that serves food... hopefully their food is better than their coffee!"}
{"text":"Of course I'm biased because I live around the corner, and it's the perfect spot for me to spend my mornings drinking espresso and eating Montreal style bagels.  Lovely staff, and the owner is working hard at building a community hub.  

Also, it's a perfect spot to read or write, and free wireless so you can write your Yelp review while you're there!"}
