{"text":"The food was delicious!  I ate starters; crab salad, meatballs, short rib and cheese.  All were really great. The crab for me was the star.  
The chef knows what he's doing.  He used to work at Hop Leaf, one of my favorite local spots in Chicago along with other great places. 
I sat at the bar and learned the place is family owned and loved their vibe.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I ordered the House Burger and it was fantastic. The meat was juicy and tender. The smoked cheddar was perfect for the savory burger. One item that really surprised me was the fries. I don't really think about the fries normally but the Tin Fox's fries were great! They make the kind of meal you will wake up craving at midnight. The service was great as well, my food was ready fast and the wait staff was super friendly. I will definitely be coming back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"This cozy spot is pretty good but with plenty of room for improvement. Went with 8 co-workers for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was empty other than 2-3 tables but you can probably blame a lot of that on the neverending Monroe Street construction. Our server was very friendly. Food took somewhat long to come out, which was disappointing given it wasn't busy, but a manager came out and apologized after our meal which was a thoughtful touch. Might've been 3 stars without that level of care. 

We had cheese curds and smelt fries starters. The curds are fabulous, some of the better ones in Madison. They're huge and maple syrup as a dipping sauce is brilliant. The smelt fries are literally small pieces of smelt fried in a light batter, so the name \"smelt fries\" somehow felt misleading, but they're tasty and they come with a very delicious and unique olive aioli. 

Most of us had a burger. I know one person was disappointed in the flavor of the tomato bisque. The burgers are pretty good but nothing special and have slightly too much bun, a slight disappointment given the elevated price of the House Burger. The thin-cut fries are very crunchy and excellent. Overall, the menu and setting have a lot of potential but need better execution."}
{"text":"We stopped in for beers and apps on a Friday night to the new spot in the neighborhood. They have 20 beers on tap and it was nothing to write home about. We ordered the cauliflower tempura and it had a ton of breading and very little flavor. The tomato soup was uninspired. 

Overall the menu looks bold but didn't deliver. It seemed disjointed and lacked a cohesive vision. We loved the previous restaurant, had high hopes for a new spot down the street, but I don't think we'll be back to the Tin Fox."}
{"text":"Truly some of the best food I have ever had! Our party had the chicken skin chips (a must have!), tempura cauliflower and duck liver mousse for appetizers. All were delicious! For entrees we had salmon (the best ever!), pork belly, duck and steak. All were delicious! Tonight's desserts were a chocolate flourless cake and a delicious lemon dish. Both were outstanding! It's not often that a restaurant can pull off so many delicious dishes, but they nailed it. Nice job, Tin Fox! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I felt like i was taking crazy pills. On first glance, the prices were a bit steep, but i thought, hey that must mean this is gonna deliver and got excited to have a new solid spot in the hood. 

then the food started to arrive... the cauliflower: was deep fried and then drizzled with a sour vinaigrette making the breading super soggy...wtf? cuahlo cheese: interesting but disjointed. still not sure exactly what was happening there. 

the pasta: nothing special, frumpy, but good thing we ordered it because it was the only edible thing we got. salmon: cooked reasonably well, risotto was inedibly salty (i salt everything) and wasn't actually a risotto, mushrooms were raw (literally it was a chunk of raw mushroom sprouts w/o any seasoning or sauce plopped on the plate) and the carrots, dear god the carrots... when this plate came out i thought i had forgotten to wash my shirt after a recent campfire in the rain. the whole table filled with a damp smoke stench (not a good one) the poor tubers were a mushy black pile. after a nibble in the hopes they tasted different than they looked and smelled (they didn't). i had a hard time not getting notes of charcoal in everything i ate for the rest of the meal (literally as if i had been eating briquettes out of a grill soaked in lighter fluid and never lit). the lake trout: again fish was honestly cooked pretty well (only saving grace), hot fish served in a cold, bland, watery soup...again WTF??? hot on cold resulting in a lukewarm fishy soupy thing. everything was either over seasoned or under seasoned and of course no S/P on the table to fix the issue. 

it was like the \"chef\" has seen photos of food in magazines and then winged it from there, sans any kind of hands-on culinary experience. i feel bad about this review but unless they have made some drastic, revolutionary, ground up, complete restructuring of the entire operation i would save your $150 for anything else."}
{"text":"My husband and I, along with a group of friends, came up from Illinois. Along our adventures for the trip, we made our way to this restaurant.  We were actually on our way to Jack's restaurant for brunch but it was closed for renovations. Since we were all already in the area, we stumbled into this restaurant nearby. 
     The atmosphere was great! They have done a fantastic job with the layout, seating and architecture. In fact, a couple of our friends ended up buying some of the artwork on the wall above our table. The menu looked so promising and the people were very friendly. Our experience wasn't bad, but there are definitely some things that need to be worked on. 
There needs to be more communication on who is doing what. It took us FOREVER to get our drinks once we were seated even though the place was barely occupied. After some of our drinks were delivered we put in our order and included two orders of the pancake battered cheese curds for our large group but they didn't bring them out first and instead they came with our food. I think intuitively, with a table as big as our, they would have gotten the idea that they were meant to be an appetizer. Another major disappointment was the food. Some of those at our table wanted the salmon benedict, but they were out. Of course, you deal and move on. I got the pork belly benedict and the pork was incredibly overcooked, dry, had very little flavor and the side of potatoes were also flavorless and overcooked. The poached eggs was poorly cooked, one of which wasn't runny at all. Even my English muffin was over charred and crunchy. We asked for simple things such as, ketchup, hot sauce and some salt/pepper. The ketchup and hot sauce came, but no salt. I asked again later, and no salt. The salt actually came at the very end of the meal and was quite insulted that it was even brought at that point when I had finished my meal.  We never were asked about coffee refills so we had to flag down the waitress and ask for more coffee. She brought one individual coffee and not the three we asked for. I found it odd they brought individual cups of coffee and not a carafe of coffee to refill the entire tables which was very inefficient. At this point, I was beyond irritated. Everyone else at the table said their food was ok but not anything spectacular, however, they did like the bloody mary's. 
     On the upside, the pancake battered cheese curds were pretty tasty and the family was very nice who were running the place. They've only been in business for about 6 weeks so I'm sure they are getting their bearings about them. I thought the price was about average for the areas, however based on the experience, it was expensive for the lack of a pallet pleasing tongue. The location is superb, the place is very clean and the ambiance was on point. I think they need better communication.  Midway through our meal, the original waitress started taking care of another table and the other started tending to us. Then, I saw them both clean a previous customers table who had just left, one after the other. This to me is a clear indication that they aren't communicating. I would give this restaurant another try when we visit again to redeem themselves because it has a ton of potential and the folks were so sweet."}
{"text":"A great place, the  epitome of Madison. Great food and drink. neighborhood. A perfect place to stop after a day out in the vibrant neighborhood."}
