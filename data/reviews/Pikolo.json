{"text":"You're an espresso bar... client comes in, you order, you drink your coffee and you leave... how is that complicated?"}
{"text":"Coffee was good though the portion was small. Scone and pastry with apples were good too but there were flies inside the cafe that flew around and tried to land on our food, and that decreased our appetites. :("}
{"text":"This small cafe on du Parc is a great place to grab your caffeine fix on any given day. I've come here for take out coffee, to sit in and chat, and also to work on my studies with some food and coffee. Though there is a second floor, the cafe can be quite cramped because it is narrow and kinda small, so it can be really hard to find space to sit at. 
The coffee for my taste is quite acidic, so if you get sick from too much caffeine or acidity, try their tea selection. Aside from the drinks, their food is quite good as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, the place has free Wi-Fi, but gets pretty packed so it may be hard to find seat at peak hours. I'm not a normal coffee drinker, but had one of their coffee (can't remember which) and tea several times, which was nice. It's small (long, narrow shaped) place and not the place you want to sit in and study for hours, but a nice, warm place for a cup of coffee or tea (optionally with their in-house baked pastry). I saw many people get coffee/pastry to go. They have few seats at the counter, and few two-person high tables, and I saw few larger tables in the back as well.

Personal opinion but, they have the best gluten-free chocolate mini bundt shaped cake. Not heavy, overwhelming or overly sweet, but with just the right amount of chocolate, it leaves you happy and fulfilled, and not craving for more."}
{"text":"The vibe here is awesome. It's happening yet chill and relaxing, at least on a Tuesday at around 2pm which is when I was there. There were many seats available and the view from the loft is great. My iced latte tasted awesome; smooth yet still quite strong. The baristas seemed really kind too and fluent in both English and French. Definitely recommend for studying or catching up with a friend."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm from Vancouver and am always searching for the ultimate coffee place while I am traveling and Pikolo hit the mark for me. Exceptional espresso, fresh baked muffins, and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend Pikolo to all my coffee snob friends."}
{"text":"Your a long way from Starbucks homie.   They do coffee right.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited Montreal for the first time and tried this cafe. In my opinion, the cappuccino was as great as the best ones in Manhattan. The cupcake was better than those in US though; much less sweet and it had a herb which was totally new to me. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with great coffee and chocolate croissants. Good place for people watching."}
{"text":"Walked a mile and a half in pouring rain from my hostel to get what looked to be the best coffee in the area (according to Yelp). Well, this ain't it. Or, at least, I hope it's not.

I agree with every other assessment of the sourness. My first drink, a macchiato, was just straight up face-puckering. My second, a cold brew, was more palatable due to the ice watering and mellowing the brew a bit, but still definitely with the sour. Finally, I decided I'd just get a cup of the house coffee, and man, once the temp went into lukewarm territory, I couldn't finish it.

It's a shame, because the space is great. The music, while I was there, was eclectic and not overbearing. The staff was helpful and friendly... just, wow, terrible tasting coffee.

For the record, I've found this to hold true: if the beans on display are lighter and look to be dry, not oily, then you can bet on the brew being this type of sour/bitter."}
{"text":"Excellent \"third wave\" espresso bar. The decor in the vibe are excellent. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Over multiple visits I've had many different espresso drinks and all of them were expertly made and well executed.

They offer a small 4 ounce latte that I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lovely place! Lattes and croissants are perfect. They were playing the Beach Boys when we walked in :) beautiful spot."}
{"text":"This half of a lovely high-ceilinged industrial-type building was renovated and turned into a darling little coffee shop that smells just like Italy and serves the best cappuccinos in the area.

Mostly populated by what seem to be McGill students and some resident hipsters tapping away on their laptops, the space is not devoid of outlets, making it easy for you to plug in and get some work done on a rainy afternoon -- or, well, any other afternoon of the year.

To come here in the morning and order something at the counter, listen to the tapping and whirring of their wonderful Mirage espresso machine, take in a whiff of the deliciously homey ground coffee beans, sit on a high stool at the window, and people-watch on Park Avenue, this place appeals to all the senses. Did I mention their great-tasting cappuccinos?"}
{"text":"Had to take our 4oz Pikolo Latte to go since the place was full, of good looking people. The latte was amazing. Left me a tingling sensation for me taste buds. Try it. 

Shame we couldn't find empty seats though. Service was sweet and rapid. Shame we couldn't find empty seats though."}
{"text":"My husband and I try to find good coffee when traveling and avoid the chains, if possible. This place was perfect! Good lattes and even better scones - we tried the sundried tomato, feta, and green onion and also the bacon, mushroom, and swiss and both were excellent. 

One warning - they didn't open until 9 am on a Saturday morning. If you're like us and up early, this seems a little late. Overall worth it though."}
{"text":"I went here a while back for an Americano to go and was very disappointed with how sour the espresso was. I noticed that a couple of other reviewers mentioned the same thing: the espresso is sour. I couldn't even finish the Americano due to the terrible taste. Beware!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a drink and a sweet bite to eat. I had the cold brew and a chocolate croissant. Both delicious. These folks know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Whoops never been here. Didn't mean to write a review. Need to figure out how to delete!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great staff (thanks Marie-Eve), good coffee, great space. Free wifi, tables are at the right height for a laptop (upstairs), outlets abound, and good tunes (when a playlist goes from Band of Horses to Beirut, you know they know good coffee shop tunage)."}
{"text":"Ambiance chaleureuse, les serveurs sont sympathiques et c'est l'endroit idéal pour les amateurs de café!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee that has a punchy taste, a deep flavor, something we didn't find in other places. Even with soy milk it still tastes fantastic, even though the soy milk absorbs much of the bouquet. Also, this was finally a place with decent chocolate buns and good croissants. Not too greasy but still tasty, not with rubbery and chewy outer shell like in some places.

I'm not sure why some people complain that the coffee is too sour here. You get sour coffee when either the beans are sour or the brew was too hot, but neither was the case here. The espresso tastes more like it would in Italy, with depth and identity, not like what you might get from most café chains, where they might mask bland beans with sugar and chocolate."}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding decent coffee while on my trip to Montreal until I visited Pikolo. They have a very knowledgeable staff that pulls the best espresso shots around - full of flavor without any bitterness or burnt taste.  They also know how to steam their milk properly, which is a subtle but important detail to be able to really bring out the flavor in a cappuccino/latte."}
{"text":"I really like the interior design of this place. Very hip! I also heard that their espresso beans were very good, full of flavour. I went there couple of times, and never was dissatisfied with what I got there. The only thing is that the place is really small, so not a lot of places to sit and chat if it is a busy day. But then again, that might be the charm of this small nice cafe!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe in the city. It's a cozy spot with a great relaxed vibe and awesome decor. Staff is really warm and welcoming. The coffee and espresso is fantastic. What more could you ask for? :)"}
{"text":"I just moved from Vancouver to Montreal, and on our first morning, my boyfriend took me to Pikolo for our first ever coffee in town! Imagine my surprise when I discovered they sell 49th Parallel coffee, which was my local Van favourite. Great coffee, delicious lattes (vegan for me please), the crew is so nice, and their music taste is spot on. Beautiful, hip/cozy interior. Don't miss this place if you are into coffee. I've been going back to buy our beans ever since that first morning in MTL, and drop in for a latte every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great coffee, funky vibe. I went on Sunday afternoon and space was limited but I managed to find a seat and had a latte and croissant. The latte fine in was quite strong, take away was better proportioned for me."}
{"text":"Cute coffee place, this place can get a bit crowded.   Try looking upstairs for table.  You might have your luck in finding a table. They have brew tea as well that are served in this cast iron tea pot.  We ordered a latte and a drip brew coffee.    Both coffee pretty Good.  Would come back again to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"So glad we made the trek out here despite the snow. awesome awesome awesome savory muffins, great chai and lattes, and best of all, the yogurt! So good."}
{"text":"I stayed a couple blocks away on a recent trip and after I happened upon it on my first morning, I just kept coming back. The staff are friendly; the space, although small, is comfortable, and the coffee is DELICIOUS. I am an unintentional coffee snob (cultivated from having an admitted coffee snob partner), and this coffee is on par with Counter Culture or Ceremony for those of you from the US. No complaints."}
{"text":"Very nice place with excellent staff. Cakes are also good although not amazing.
I have tried both regular short espressos and lattes and both were amazing.
The atmosphere is also quite good, it is mostly occupied by students who have their laptops opened, so it's a calm environment except for the traffic outside."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled across Pikolo - open just three weeks - while she was looking for great coffee in Montreal.  

She wasn't disappointed.  I'm not a coffee fan, but Daniela - a coffee snob - sighed in happiness at her first sip, and I thoroughly enjoyed the chai tea latte I had.  The chocolate banana bread was spectacular and spicy (with cloves, all spice, and nutmeg), and is baked by proprietor Marie-Eve herself.  

Marie-Eve is super friendly and cut her teeth on third-wave coffee in Australia.  She's incredibly passionate about coffee and Pikolo feels cool and friendly without being pretentious.  The space is beautiful, with high ceilings, dark wood, tons of light, and metal fixtures.  Really a great place to get some work done, sip a delicious hot bevvy, or write a yelp review ;) 

If we lived this wonderful city, this would be my go-to coffee shop. I have no doubt Pikolo is going to be a fixture of the Montreal coffee shop scene for a long time."}
{"text":"Pikolo coffee is good no doubt, quick morning service, great location during summer ...you can seat outside enjoy the sun and parc ave, friendly service and affordable"}
{"text":"I like the latte pikolo (iced)so much! I personally thinks it's stronger than the regular latte here,try it if you prefer strong flavour like me. And today I discovered the brownie is amazing too! But I don't see them often, I guess they just make them occasionally ,I will defiantly have a piece of brownie next time with my coffee!"}
{"text":"Good for college students may be. Guy at the counter did not attend to me. He was busy talking to another guy. 5 min later, he goes thru motions of taking order. Was expecting more from a place rated this high. Latte that i had was pretty ordinary. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Cheaper than Starbucks, not to mention a local business,  cozy atmosphere and perfect for business meetings."}
{"text":"Hervorragender Espresso und Kaffe. Eine wahre Oase für den Kaffeeliebhaber in der Wüste an wässriger Brühe die ansonsten in Montreal angeboten wird"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. I had an americano while my friend had a moka. The moka is absolutely to die for. Great coffee coupled with rich chocolate while balancing the sweetness just right. My americano was also great, not overly sour just the way I like them.

The experience wouldn't have been the same without the croissant which are in my recollection some of the best I've had (or perhaps blame the hungry tummy). Melts in your mouth with rich buttery flavour and an awesome crunch. I would come back here for the croissant alone in a heartbeat. Do keep in mind other food offerings are quite limited so not the place to go if you feel going gastronomic with your coffee.

The place is small, great atmosphere and was quite crowded the time I visited (early Saturday morning)."}
{"text":"Love this cute little coffee shop near McGill. It also means you will have no problem with English and nobody would think of you differently if you don't speak French. Hooray. They use Westcoast beans and the familiar 49th parallel is brewed here among other roasters in the coast. It's so cute and fun to just people watch while seated on a stool. Fairly small seating area though."}
{"text":"Great latte and fresh croissants with just the right amount of crunch. The pastry selection is small, but everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I tried an Americano, and I found it too sweet. My BF really enjoyed his, but the particular beans they use are not pleasing to my palate. I've experienced this with many high rated coffee shops, and end up disappointed.

We also tried a lemon poppy seed scone and a croissant. Both were quite tasty!

The staff are very friendly, and the decor is awesome. I just wish the coffee tasted stronger and fuller."}
{"text":"Ah, mon bébé... Plein d'amour pour cet endroit. Café délicieux, baristas expérimentés, un chaï avec de la gueule, et un petit délice sans gluten. Le personnel et les clients sont toujours gentils, décontractés et sympathiques, et c'est toujours un plaisir de venir relaxer et travailler ici. L'étoile qui manque est pour la disponibilité moins grande de plats salés, s'ils étaient sans gluten et produits laitiers en plus je serais en extase!"}
{"text":"Seriously good coffee place.  I had a Machiato and a double espresso.  Both were very good.  Espresso had good taste and great crema.  The barista properly double-tamped the puck an the result was great.

This is a serious coffee place for people who are serious about coffee."}
{"text":"Great spot for an espresso and a pastry.  Just the right amount of noise, hipster-ish without being nauseating, not overrun with laptop creeps, and a good selection of high quality pastries and really nice espresso drinks.  Looks like some good food options on this little stretch as well as a very groovy looking paper shop next door."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and good coffee close to the hotel I was staying at for a conference. I'd recommend it to others for a quick snack and coffee while they are in town."}
{"text":"It's not easy to find a good espresso bar in downtown Montreal, but this one is really good! It's a cute place, and I tried the Pikolo latte, which was perfect"}
{"text":"Great coffee, atmosphere, and baked goods in this little place. If you are in the McGill area this is the best coffee there is. However this place doesn't stack up to the big boys in town like Cafe Olympico. Lattes have been inconsistent, the place can get filled with dirty dishes, and it lacks proper airflow. I gave it 4/5 because it is the best in the neighborhood but it can be better if it worked out some of these problems. A good addition to Montreal's coffee scene."}
{"text":"Commencer ça journée avec un grand latte et un croissant de chez Pikolo, c'est prendre soin de son bonheur. Mini havre de paix et des réconfort, ce café est un des mes endroits fétiches à Montréal."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in North America! Closest to a standard Melbourne coffee I've managed to find. Lovely staff & nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I didn't like my mocha.  Buyer beware that they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Montreal without hesitation. Amazing staff, delicious coffee and great ambiance! Perfect every time and I've been there dozens of times."}
{"text":"This is quite simply a genuine 5-star world class purveyor of coffee. The greatness at Pikolo starts with the owner who is REAL coffee person; meaning she goes to great lengths to ensure the integrity of the people, equipment, processes, and ingredients to provide a consistent level of excellence that is lacking in soooooo many places we carelessly slap with the label of greatness due to having been randomly blessed by the \"Hit\" portion of the hit or miss equation.  

Superb, freshly roasted beans are always on hand with a generous assortment available for take home as well.  Baked goods are also top class with vegan and gluten free offerings typically on the menu.  All of this goodness is delivered in a very laid-back environment without the double-shots of hipster pretentiousness that can (and do) spoil some of the other great coffee houses in the city (and everywhere)  Convenient to the hotels on Sherbrooke if you're a tourist / business visitor.  If you're a student and haven't found this place then you should just give up and go to school in another city."}
{"text":"I love Pikolo! After a very good visit, and an equally as good revisit, I am confident in saying this little cafe is a winner. Excellent coffee and various sweet and savoury treats to choose from. All of the above are delicious! The only tricky part is finding yourself a seat!"}
{"text":"Avec tous les cafés qui ouvre, Pikolo se tient toujours au top. C'est vraiment le meilleur café à Montréal (avec café plume)."}
{"text":"Very good third wave coffee shop and really friendly staff.  We stopped here many times during our stay in Montreal.  Put this place on your list."}
{"text":"Excellent latte service très efficace emplacement universitaire embiance industriels mon choix de réveil"}
{"text":"Traveled from Montreal over the weekend and must say. I wish the coffee was as good. The place is hip and amazing. Cant wait to come back! The owner was really nice as well. Thank You :)"}
{"text":"Easy chilling bar. Went for early coffee and small breakfast. Americano was fantastic. Great way to start the day! And the yoghurt with rhubarb compote and granola - yammy!
Could easily chill and relax, read newspapers, listen to music and watch people coming and going. (It was quite busy from 8-9am!)
I like the industrial but cozy feeling. Definately worth checking out - not least because of the coffee!"}
{"text":"After reading most of the reviews and realizing that it is minutes from my parents; Sunday I went with my aunt; we had a cold brew, a mochaccino and quinoa cranberry muffin.

Service was friendly and quick and the coffee was okay, texture of the muffin novel to us.

This is really a student hangout; despite enjoying the people watching at the window, neither of us felt in our element; for this reason I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I never ever write a review on Yelp even although the food (or whatever I try) is very good. However, this time I have to write something here! I have to say this espresso bar is my FAVORITE cafe ever! I came all the way from Boston to Montreal to try as many bakeries and cafes as I can. BY FAR, this place has the most amazing croissants, baked goods, espresso, and cappuccino in Montreal!! It was even \"slightly\" better than the ones in \"Patisserie Au Kouign Amann(my second favorite bakery/cafe)\". I strongly recommend their chocolate croissant and the apple turnover! They were just absolutely superb and magical. :) Their plain croissant and mini-upside-down chocolate cake were also very very delicious! I think they bake everything on the spot even several times a day(of course they should). 
The only thing you need to keep in mind is that they only accept cash or debit(from Canadian Banks) and that their wireless connection is not very strong. But still, it's my favorite place in Montreal. I am going to come back here again tomorrow morning before I leave for Boston. :)"}
{"text":"I read about the mocha here and had to try it, being a lover of hot chocolatey coffee beverages anywhere. 

So this place is great! They have one of those molten chocolate machines keeping thick melted chocolate ready to go at all times. 

And you can get it for less than $5 Canadian. 

Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"I love the decor/atmosphere of this place. It's cozy but you're usually able to find a space to sit if you want. I'm definitely no coffee connoisseur, but once my live-for-coffee, die-for-coffee crazy hipster friends brought me here and gave it their approval. So there's that."}
{"text":"Out of the three or four espresso/coffee bars I've been to in MTL, this one is by far
my favourite.

For some reason, I liked it best. The espresso based drink I had was very good, and my friends enjoyed theirs.

Backstory: I was in town for the weekend, visiting a West Coast friend who was in for a conference. I was referred to this spot by a local roaster, so I went. 
After that I dragged my friend over, since it was only a block from his hotel.
Following our experience, I stopped here a few times, and my friend took all of his conference mates as well, and they all raved about it.

The treats looked good, and the staff was nice. 
But most important: the coffee hit the spot."}
{"text":"I was just a blow into Montreal for a few days, so tried to find the best coffee places. Americans was good, had everything you might want to adjust it (milk, cream, cold water, honey or sugar) etc. Coffee itself was quite good, think it was a Brazilian bean they'd recently roasted.

Recommended, though a tad more expensive ($3) than other speciality coffee houses and not sure the quality difference is there. 

Lovely decor, nice upstairs seating area. :) will be back next time."}
{"text":"Darling little coffee spot with a limited selection of pastries and breakfast items. Latte was well made and served in a glass cup.  Chocolate croissant was very good - not the best, but still crispy outside with melty chocolate inside.  

Pikolo comes up under a 'brunch' search on Yelp.  This is more of a coffee spot."}
{"text":"Very good coffee! The service is good. The place has personality and a good amount of seats if you want to enjoy your coffee right there. They have good baked goods as well."}
{"text":"Love love this place. I have been here so many time i can't recall. Frist time was with my boyfriend. Tend to be a bit crowded some time. The service is always quick and they make super good coffee and the cakes/muffin/tart are always so good. I always look forward on trying new dessert."}
{"text":"Beautiful little space, a great addition to the neighbourhood! I had driven, walked and bused by many a time without stopping in, and it took running into a coworker who was on her way there to finally convince me to stop. And am I glad that it all worked, because that was one enjoyable coffee. In a pretty space. Made by competent people. At a reasonable price. Add it all up: good stuff!"}
{"text":"Really great coffee bar serving coffee from some of the best roasters in North America (Phil & Sebastian - Calgary and Heart - Portland on the day I visited).  Their granola and yogurt was just what I needed, and the coffee was pulled by a good looking barista who really knew what he was doing.  Loved the look and feel of the space. If I lived in Montreal I would def hang out here."}
{"text":"Tourist-friendly. Good coffee and scone. Will try croissants if have chance and they are not sold out."}
{"text":"Shut up and take my money.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Est-ce que Montréal avait besoin d'un autre café sur Parc près du ghetto McGill (où Milton Place)?
 Et bien oui... Aucun autres endroits, petit où grand, offraient ce que le Pikolo propose. Le petit café qui peu accomoder un maximum de 35 à 40 personnes sur 2 niveau, sert une variété de pâtisserie maison et une sélection de cafés et de thés tous aussi succulents les uns que les autres. La musique d'embiance au volume parfaitemet dosé, propose du \" soft indie rock \" ( The Stroke, El Pedro del Mar, The Shins ....) la plupart de temp.
Décor chaleureux principalement du aux boisseries, le plafond de 16 pieds, le plancher en terraseau et de grandes fenêtres sur un cotés et en façade. Ils vendent les cafés Phil & Sebastian coffee Roasters Huuuum! 
En résumé un endroit renové et préservé avec goût qui renferme un petit bijou de café  !!! :-) Ils offre même une carte fidélité (10em café gratuit).

Je vous met au défi de vous assoir une heure dans ce petit café sans tomber sous le charme comme sous la mitraille.... 

4* au lieu de 5*??? C'est un endroit merveilleux mais à mon avis il y a mieu comme café à Montréal .... à eux je réserve la note parfaite !!!!! :) 

Pour ceux que ça intéresse:
Édifice du parc est d'un style architectural en voie de disparition à MTL. La façade imite un chateau avec des long murs en bloc de béton, des vitraux au dessus des fenêtres et des gargouilles que trône au dessus des fausses tourelles..... ici j'ai besoin d'un conaisseur en architecture pour me donner le nom du genre moi j'y connais pas grand chose :-? Allez y donc en grand nombre pour que le commerce y fleurisse que le proprio soit contant et qu'on ne transforme pas l'endroit en Condo"}
{"text":"We ordered a cappuccino and a mocha latte and neither one of us would repeat or recommend.  If you like Starbucks coffee than this might be for you, otherwise we found it to be very bitter and acidic.  It had a very strong after taste.  

The place has nice atmosphere, but maybe because they are limited on space no free Wifi."}
{"text":"Latte was so delicious! Wish I had tried the pastries, they looked so good."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had a mocha with almond milk that was rich and delicious. Boyfriend had an allonge (long shot) that he loved. We both had a jalapeño cheddar scone that was great!

Like the name suggests, this place is very small, although we were able to find two seats on the balcony overlooking the baristas. Great place to enjoy a café and snack on a dreary Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Cute and convenient. Friendly service. Not sure about the hype. Croissant and espresso were just okay."}
{"text":"I'm still loving the interior at this place, especially the cozy mezzanine overlooking the bar. The café was recently bought out by mtl veterans Myriade and they've brought Phil & Sebastien roasters in, as well as a V60 brew bar for filter coffee-cool in theory, but often slow and inconsistent in practice. At least they've kept their tasty baked goods! Still a solid spot but not what it used to be. P.S. They often close an hour early at 6pm so call and check if you plan on arriving late."}
{"text":"Im on a mission to try as many local coffee shops as I can in Montreal before heading back to California. Pikolo is right down the street from my apartment and I have been there a few times. 

My favorite drink on the menu are their lattes. Very smooth taste, barely any bitterness and a good amount for the price. 
I used to have to put tons of sugar in my lattes just to tolerate the bitter taste. But thanks to Pikolo, all i need is a dash of cinnamon and i'm good to go!"}
{"text":"we ducked in  here on our first day in montreal. it's small, quaint, and has this gritty but rustic feel to it. rest assured that everyone is super friendly. the space may be small, but its got tons of heart. 


you come here for their drinks and especially their coffees which have beans roasted in the local area or around canada (i know, quite a large area). we ordered a london fog with a croissant (see, i did eat a crossiant everyday!). the LG was light and surprisingly a little heady with a good foam on top. while, i cannot profess to loving the fog, i was definitely transported into a whimsy in one taste. 

especially enjoyable when there's light rain outside. the space is fantastic and the vibe here is hard to beat. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing mocha. I normally shy away from mocha due to their overwhelming sweetness at other establishments. However, Pikolo has mastered it. It was more of a good quality dark chocolate flavor. Couldn't recommend it enough, even if you aren't usually a mocha fan."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get some espresso. This was a couple of blocks from my hotel. It has a cool vibe and they know their beans.  The espresso was evenly and cleanly pulled and had a flavorful depth of flavor. A great place that I recommend."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs cafés proche du centre-ville de Montréal. Espace un peu trop petit et sombre pour travailler malgré le fait qu'ils ont un 2e étage. Ils ferment un peu trop tôt pour moi. 

Bon café pour discuter ou à prendre pour emporter."}
{"text":"I came here after a long while even though I live really close because my last experience wasn't the best so I had to update my review to reflect my most recent experience. Came here with my sister and we both had lattés and mama mia -so perfect! Smooth,rich and silky texture of the espresso complemented with a good 2/3 milk ratio. The milk was skillfully steamed and you could taste the quality of the product, the freshness played largely into its natural sweetness. I also thought the temperature of the drink was superbly accurate (atleast for me). Sometimes I find the espresso bars in Montreal serving coffee that is not warm enough, I know that seaming milk too much can burn it so it's hard to get that foam and froth within ~60° but too often the coffee here gets cold before I'm done drinking half of it. Pikolo's temperature was en pointe -warm enough for the duration of a good conversation but not so warm that it got bitter. Just be careful when holding the glass mugs!"}
{"text":"This city's coffee is off the wall. I mean it. What is special about Pikolo is the fact that the ambience feels like you stepped into NYC. A quiet, dreamy NY that is. The coffee is great and what is even more exciting is that they take and make their coffee seriously! If you enjoy Cafe Myriade, Saint Henri Micro-Torrifactor then you will not be disappointed! I can pretty much guarantee this!."}
{"text":"Very disappointed   Good reviews but absolutely not a place for breakfast.  No seating, no room to move inside, and no menu to speak of. Also if from the US the told us that they exchange currency (at par) so they tipped themselves 23%.  Maybe this is for upscale yuppy types but not for an average breakfast."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the coffee at all. Very hipstery. I placed my order to the barista next to the coffee machine and he told me in very condescending  way that I need to pay first. He could just say it nicely."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee place. Great ambience and perfect latte. Really recommend the chocolate muffin too"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes in MTL.
They were serving a top notch single origin roasted in Calgary. My beverage we excellently crafted, being so far away from home I appreciated an experienced barista. The ambience was charming and quaint. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso drinks and baked goods. Friendly staff. A bit tight inside, but most people come for take out so I have always been able to sit down. I like the decor too, kind of vintage. I would recommend it to everyone who happens to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Spot
To people for whom Parc Ave is the street used to rush downtown and back, Pikolo's the best coffee shop they never notice. It's narrow and deep, nestled between a stationary shop and first date staple Pullman. Through most of the winter, you can't even see inside because the windows are steamy from how warm the people, croissants and coffee are behind 'em.
But to people who think of Parc Ave as Montreal's heart and soul, Pikolo's the best coffee shop, period. The café balances an industrial look with earthy colours, its heavy wooden chairs and tables laid out under a high ceiling from which metal lamps and soft light bulbs hang. It's high-style coziness, and it's got us coming back for more.

What's Really Good? 
Let's put it plainly: you'd be tough pressed finding better coffee anywhere in Montreal.
\"Passion\" seems too generic a word to describe owner Marie-Ève Laroche's commitment to coffee. Talk to her for a minute or two and you'll come to realize she hasn't only set out to serve first-class coffee but also to educate customers as to where it comes from, how it's best prepared, what to look out for in its taste. Watching the equally-dedicated baristas at work is watching scientists in a laboratory, controlling grams of coffee, milliliters of water, extraction times, temperatures. It's the kind of stuff that turns casual coffee lovers into aficionados.

Not typically does one know the first thing about those metrics either. All we know is that when you taste the coffee, they start making a lot of sense. The house specialty is the Pikolo latte (pictured), in case you're undecided, though for what it's worth we'd add that the director of quality control, Mitchell, also makes the best Americano in town.

All this knowledge and Marie-Ève's experience working on various coffee plantations extend to the source of what is served, of course. Pikolo collaborates with Canadian microroaster Phil & Sebastian and the Portland-based Heart, two roasters keen on quality, detail, and green coffee. And it's not just the coffee, either: we're also talking homemade, oven-hot butter croissants, raspberry-cranberry muffins, sugar-cinnamon waffles, chocolate fondants ...

You'll Wanna Know
It's a small space, so if you're looking for a coffee house to spend your Sunday working on a final paper, get ready to peel your eyes to find a spot. You'll usually be able to find one within minutes, but it gets a little tricky when you're not on your own.

Cash or debit ($5 minimum) only."}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee places in the city, but with one fatal flaw; my order is rarely correct.

I've been here about twenty times and more than three quarters of the time my order, which is always a decaf soy latte, ends up either not soy, or not decaf. It's never both wrong, but it does get a little frustrating to always have to double check your order."}
{"text":"I had a very unfortunate experience at this café. I ordered a London Fog which was far from hot (borderline cold). I asked them if it would be possible to heat it up, and the staff said no because I had already taken a sip... How is a customer expected to know whether their hot drink is warm enough without trying it? They said the only option would be to remake it, but they wouldn't do that either. Very displeased with their customer service."}
{"text":"Love it. great atmosphere. Magical coffee (try the Gibralta). Excellent food. Marvellous staff.  They really care about what they do here.

Worth travelling all the way from New Zealand."}
{"text":"Great little cozy cafe that we came across during our stay in Montreal. Made for a pleasant stop for a short coffee break and a quick bite. 
The cappuccino and latte were both very aromatizing and quite strong. The cappuccino was more bitter than how I usually like it cuz I'm a pansy when it comes to coffee, but it brings out the aroma when it's not drowned in sugar, I suppose. 
We tried the cranberry scone. It was super buttery and not overly sweet. Loved it. The spinach / cheese pastry was also a great snack to grab and go - fresh and crispy."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed space and excellent coffee. However, the young lady at the cash register on Saturday last went out of her way to be rude and sarcastic to me to the extent that I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Possibly the best mocha latte I've ever had in my life. The baristas were very nice and the environment was busy and interesting. Very good for people watching. Seating is limited but we managed to snag a table within 5 mins."}
{"text":"I love this place ! They have the best latte of the whole city! It's a must try!!! Even talking about it makes want to have one! That's how good it is!!!"}
{"text":"How anyone could give this place less than 5 stars eludes me. This is probably the best mocha in town. I don't like sugar coffee drinks but this mocha is out of this world. They actually have a molten batch of melted chocolate that goes right into the coffee!!! It's crazy!!! 

Their cold brew is great, and same as the filtered coffee. The desserts here are pretty good too!! I like the pecan tarts. 

Highly recommended! These guys understand coffee and cafe culture, they deliver a product that is above and beyond. If you can appreciate a quality cup of coffee, you owe it to yourself to try this place.

I gave this place 5 stars because I do not think there is any room for any improvements."}
{"text":"Pikolo Espresso Bar is a paradise for genuine espresso lovers. As soon as you walk in, you get a great whiff of its style and essence. The cafe's cool, young, and vibrant ambiance is made up within a perfect, cozy space to cuddle up in a corner with your laptop or catch up with a friend. They provide free and fast WiFi so you can get your work done efficiently while sipping on the greatest pick-me-up you will ever have. Pikolo does not serve food, but they do serve delectable baked goodies that seem to be made fresh and change on a regular basis.

Their menu is focused on great espressos and the art of making a fantastic coffee. I always order their cappuccino, it is so good that it has changed my life and my expectations. It is the real deal. Moreover, the little designs that they so perfectly draw over your espresso absolutely blows my mind. My jaw dropped as I was watching the barista pour the steamed milk into the cup, effortlessly creating a beautiful tulip for me. The staff is bilingual, friendly, and so skilled that I am positive they could whip up any coffee to meet your needs."}
{"text":"Oh well... Professional coffee brewing with Brooklyn-grade mannerisms and paraphernalia, aging skaters, asymmetric haircuts,, tired tattoos, 'creative' gents with dreamy eyes and sticker-laden MacBooks, various combinations of wheat-flour, sugar and fat with fancy names such as Vegan Bombe d'Energie, along with a few gluten-free options for the modern-day neurotic... You get the picture.

On the + side, their straight iced coffee is decent, which is extremely rare--on Earth. Noise level is comfortable. Music is tasteful. Natural light aplenty."}
{"text":"Easily top 10 in MTL.  Everything about this place screams awesomeness!  The only issue is seating but it kind of adds to it's value... Something about the law of scarcity I believe."}
{"text":"I love coffee, and this is certainly one of the best cafes in the Milton/Parc area. I come here often: I've had their americano, espresso, cappucino, and their latte. Everything is amazing. Granted, I've never had their pastries, but they do look pretty yummy.

They make their coffee products with coffee from Phil and Sebastian coffee roasters, which is a premiere coffee roaster from Calgary. Their service is quick and amiable every time, and I would not hesitate to recommend this spot for some good coffee. 

It's quite cozy inside, and it could (arguably) use more space, but there are two floors if the first floor is full. They also sell bags of coffee, from roasters like 49th Parallel (out of Vancouver), Cut Coffee Roasters (out of Toronto) and of course, Phil and Sebastian. 

Great place!"}
{"text":"\"Pikolo's is where ya go if you're a coffee snob like me.\"  That's what our friend said to us as we woke up and got ready to explore Montreal.   With this comment in mind, we trekked to the itty-bitty coffee shop and stood in line, engulfed in the heavenly aroma of java and brews.  

I ended up choosing the Chai Tea Latte and it's the best cup I've ever tasted.  Would definitely return the next time I am in Montreal.  

Space is really cramped and there is no way to avoid bumping into others.  That really stinks when you're standing in line for 15 minutes.  

Also, Pikolo accepts American dollars and gives you Canadian back, no foreign transaction fees here!"}
{"text":"The brewed coffee was only so-so. But the Pikolo soy latte, a small latte served in a small glass, was excellent. A window seat offered a great street view."}
{"text":"This is an excellent café. The baristas are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They make your drink of choice with grace and love. This is serious artisanal coffee! My drink of choice is the Cortado or the Gibraltar (that is their moniker of choice for this particular drink at Pikolo) and it is excellent! Their blueberry scone is the best scone I've had outside of the U.K. but they go fast. Seriously, their scones are gone by like eleven o'clock... The early bird seriously gets the scone. Also their seasonal house fruit compote, granola and yoghourt parfait is sumptuous. Go here before, after or in between classes because it's a quick hop, skip and a jump away from McGill. Sit down, relax, read a book, study or daydream and let the world pass you by. If you're lucky you'll get a spot upstairs to set up shop and really enjoy your coffeehouse experience. Atop your regal perch you'll be able to survey your domain, pontificate over coffee and meditate on the universe. If you can't sit upstairs you should stay and sit downstairs and be in the mix. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"a delightful little coffee shop on Parc!  I was staying across the street at the Hilton Garden inn and wanted to duck into a coffee shop to sip and read my book on a rainy cold days.  Pikolo did the trick! I drink coffee everyday but don't consider myself a connoisseur, but I enjoyed my latte!  The place is small so seating is limited."}
{"text":"Love this place a thousand times over.  Some of the 5 star reviews will tell you why it's perfect.
I will tell you WHY this has a few bad reviews:

Their espresso is VERY strong and very bitter.  This is not a bad thing on their part- but up to personal preference.  This espresso is made to be put in milk based drinks and is best in milk based drinks like lattes, cappuccinos.  If you MUST try the espresso on it's own do NOT get allonge.  Allonge means \"long\"- which is a long pull and will make the already-bitter espresso- more bitter!  In Montreal people tend to drink their espresso allonge- which is actually pretty rare to find in the best coffee houses.  
So if you are going to go the espresso route as expressly for a short \"ristretto\" pull OR get the macchiato or a dry cappuccino- that way some milk is incorporated and it will ease the bitterness of the espresso.

(This place is also VERY anglo- being in McGill ghetto.  Some cafes with nicer espresso will not be so nice if you are Anglo- here there is no attitude, just good coffee)."}
{"text":"awesome coffee. very nice cafe. free fast wifi. great service. quite busy and a little cramped inside, but highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Location: Parc and Sherbrooke. Street parking (metered) or transit. 

The place: Love the space and the little 'loft' upstairs though it's very small, so you're best to take your order to go, or go when its quieter. Around 8 a.m. there were a fair number of available seats. There are also two benches outside.

The goods: Coffee, obviously, and the best muffins in town. Peach-Coriander and Strawberry-Tarragon were my picks and they were both amazing and delicious. Real fruit, and fragrant herbs. Yum! The latté that I ordered was also very good. Really enjoyed  it.

Service: The clerk who took my order was super friendly - no complaints here. 

Price point: Large latté and two muffins ran me $10."}
{"text":"Pikolo is a great alternative to the corporate coffee chains you find on Park Avenue. I often make a detour to go take an espresso there - it tastes amazing, a little sour like it's custom in Northern Italy. The only problem is that, well, the coffee shop is indeed small. I often need to consume my espresso standing. But I guess an always full coffee shop is better than an empty one.

Continue your great job."}
{"text":"Je peux faire un détour juste pour un café de cet endroit. C'est le gens de café si bon qu'il donne frisson à chaque gorgé. Ambiance hipster à la McGill, mais sans prétention. De vrais baristas derrière le comptoir. Aussi, belle ambiance pour travailler à son portable."}
{"text":"Lovely!! Awesome third wave style coffee and the space is so cute. Tucked away and was a nice way to get out of the freezing temperatures"}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip cookie ever ! Was warm, the chocolate just melted in your mouth. Went perfect with a cold brew in a hot summer day"}
{"text":"I feel lucky that Pikolo is right in my backyard. This coffee shop has tons of charm, and is a favorite of many, not only in the neighbourhood, but also in town. Prices aren't cheap and sizes can seem rather small, but the quality is there. 

They used to have recurrent problems with their coffee machine last summer (something was leaking, I think), which is why we stopped going there for awhile, but the troubles have since gone away. They also used to have the yummiest zucchini/goat cheese muffin - they had less than a dozen at a time, and it was a rush against time to buy some before they were sold out. Apart from coffee, they also offer a variety of other products. I've bought beans from Pikolo (49th parallel, Phil and Sebastian), even a bag of decaf to trick my boyfriend (\"It's weird, I feel tired\"). I even got a V60 dripper from Hario to experiment with Japanese pour-over iced coffee. 

Pikolo is a place that brings inspiration (or repels procrastination) to many essay-minded Arts students. For me, it's more of an occasional treat than anything else."}
{"text":"Wonderfully-but-not-overly cheerful baristas give this place a welcoming, relaxed feel. The coffee and espresso pours reflect solid understanding of and respect for the coffee craft. Delicious coffee and pastries. Charming, unpretentious setting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just a cool place that treats coffee like an art !!!! I just love their cappuccino and of course they draw a heart in the middle :) it's the typical hipster coffee house ambiance with good service and a few tables with retro decor that makes the place look like it's been around forever. I would give a better rating and good more of often if they still opened a bit later but unfortunately they close at max 7 pm everyday."}
{"text":"Super petit café très agréable, même quand il est bondé...  j'ai opté pour un thé, servi dans une vraie théière en fonte, le + qui fait beaucoup et pour un prix très raisonnable. 
Côté sucré, j'ai partagé un brownie sans gluten et sans produits laitiers, très bon (même si à peine trop sucré à mon goût) avec un goût de caramel !
Une délicieuse odeur de grains de café se dégage et les lattes sont si beaux, qu'ils me donnent vraiment envie d'apprécier le café !"}
{"text":"One word. Croissant. The best I had in Montreal so far.  Large, Crispy, buttery. With a double espresso its perfect."}
{"text":"Went in here for an Americano. They were playing the new Frank Ocean, nuff said. Great coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is the first café I went to since living in Montreal. They make a fine cup of latte and cappuccino, but it's nothing spectacular that would blow me out the water. I do however, enjoy their latte art and it's always pleasant to come here after an exhausting day to sweet creative designs on my coffee. I've tried their lemon poppy seed bread and that thing I gotta say is dense and pack full of flavour. They sport a laid back and unpretentious atmosphere but finding seating could be difficult sometimes during their busy hours. I guess that simply showcases their popularity amongst the community."}
{"text":"If you like good coffee, this is not the place to go. If you like hipster looking coffees hops, but do not care about the taste of your coffee, it is a nice place. Went there twice and had an americano and both times the coffee was sour. Maybe it is ok if you put a lot of cream and sirup, but the coffee itself is below par."}
{"text":"They've got a great drip coffee. They'll also accept plastic (the credit kind) payment, which is apparently quite rare in Montreal. Fantastic option for takeout coffee or sit down and enjoy a nice baked good with your drink inside."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited Montreal for 4 days.  We scoured the city for decent coffee.  We tried Presse cafe, and I asked for an iced latte, I was given some sort of frozen icee coffee garbage.  I don't even know what it was supposed to be.  I was so disappointed.  So we turned to yelp to help us find a third wave shop.  We were considering trying the second cup when we walked by a few times and then figured out it was a local chain, but never got there since we found Pikolo.  Pikolo should be called the first cup...

It is the only good coffee in Montreal you need to try.  Don't waste your time anywhere else.  Once you stop here, you won't need any other cafe.  Ever changing espresso choices.  The day we were there they had one espresso offering in the morning and by the afternoon (we had to go back for more after hiking up Montreal) they had another espresso offering.

The staff was friendly and knew what they were doing.

If you like a cafe that knows how to pull a smooth espresso then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Thus is not only a great espresso bar in Montreal it's probably one of the best I've been to ever -- great espresso drinks and the best, fluffiest peach scone I believe is on the planet! A definite stop"}
{"text":"Feel like in Paris. Coffee was a little strong but definitely delicious.  Pastries were also very good."}
{"text":"Loved this coffee place! I got a pastry here and it was delicious. It's a bit small but there is seating upstairs. Be sure to stop by if you need a quick cup of coffee or some carbs."}
{"text":"The Mocha was as impressive as I have read so far. 
On the other hand, the lack of wifi makes the intake of caffeine counter -productive. I mean, it is 2015. This is a cafe in the middle of downtown. Not a speakeasy. Also, the lady at the cash wasn't nice in her way of telling me they don't have free public wifi. 
Time to move coffee shops."}
{"text":"I love independent cafés, and a café with baristas who rock Movember are probably the ones for me. If you're in Montreal with some downtime, I'd suggest this place as a wonderful way to kill time with a good book and lively atmosphere. There's plenty of seating - considering how small the café is and the price is decent too! I mean, you're probably going to spend the same amount at your regular Second Cup or whatever - so unless it's Tim Hortons, there's no reason not to support your local café. And there's free wifi!

I got a London Fog (the recent drink of my life) and loved it. Strong Earl Grey flavor in a nice big cup. I really wished I could try the baked goods but I didn't have too much cash on me. Maybe next time - because Pikolo really convinced me that Montreal is worth that long trip!"}
{"text":"One of the (very) few Montreal coffee shops that cater to the light roast lovers out there

They routinely try different beans, which makes the walk/ drive there filled with suspense mixed with the right amount Java excitement.

If you like your light roast, don't wait or waste your time on the proliferating coffee shops serving burnt and bitter coffee; instead head over to pikolo for what will very likely be a memorable cup of joe"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a coffee soon after checking into our hotel.  It's a charming, small and intimate spot, with wooden floors and vintage wooden tables and chairs. It has an intentional \"worn-in and cozy\" feeling. 

We ordered a superb latte and cappuccino - the latte in particular was impressive as it can be a fail in many shops. Here it still manages to be rich and robust - reminded us of Europe. Croissants are fantastic! Buttery and crispy, with a light chewy Center.  If you're in the neighbourhood this is a great place to stop."}
{"text":"While on my travels I have found it can be very difficult at times to find decent coffee because everyone has their own idea of what makes a good coffee (I still don't get people who can happily down a Starbucks coffee at the insane prices they charge for it)

If you like great service, properly trained barista staff who know how to do proper espresso shots and steam/texture their milk the way it should always be done...Pikolo is the place for you!

I had a great tasting cappuccino and the staff were pleasant and friendly. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing Espresso! But don't try and get it to go. My friend was almost beat up! (for good reason of course...)"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place so badly with all those positive reviews out there, but we were not impressed with the cappuccino we got. Nothing special and for $4+, I've had better ones elsewhere. Tiny little place, super warm without AC in 70+ degree weather....not sure what the hype is about..."}
{"text":"A tie for the best cappuccino in Montreal (in my opinion of course) and some fantastic pastries.

A bit piccolo in the inside but I'd guess that's the point.  Really really good coffee and that's why I was there.  Would I walk 4k in the cold again for a couple of caps?  Probably, as long as I could sit for a minute and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"If I lived here, this would be one of my regular spots. The coffee is well poured, and with great beans. The space itself is beautiful (if small), with a strong artsy vibe - we came during the summer, but I'm sure it's popular with the college crowd. You can pick a spot and hang out for a bit, but I found it too busy and loud for my taste. But then, it's all about the coffee anyway, which more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Very small cafe but makes a delicious coffee. I also really enjoyed the pastries. I had the strawberry and peach muffin and my husband had the apple turnover; both were delicious."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience here was perfect, except for one thing: the espresso.  I'll get to that in a moment. First, the positives. Mind-numbingly fresh and flaky croissant, perky and attentive help, hip and modern atmosphere, reasonable prices, and perfect location made this coffee bar a great choice.

Unfortunately, the espresso is following the trend of so many hip, new wave, trendy coffee bars across North America, they're sour. Insanely and inappropriately sour. So much attention and detail is put into producing what is an overly sour shot. Either the coffee is too fresh or the temperatures are too low at the beginning of the pull, but it's just not the way espresso should be. Smoothed out by milk, the coffee stands up well, but as a single straight shot, not so much.

If the espresso hadn't been a sour acid bomb, I would have easily given this place five stars."}
{"text":"I can't give a complete review because I only tried their espresso, but let me just say that the double shot I ordered was a pretty terrible espresso for an 'espresso bar'. I may not be an espresso expert, but I'm pretty sure that they are not supposed supposed to be sour. What I had was definitely under-extracted, and could've been pulled a few extra seconds. Everything happened so fast that I didn't even see the grind, dose, tamp, and pull, so I'm not sure if something else could've been a problem.

To their credit though, was that even in all its sourness, I could taste that the beans they used was amazing. Tons of character. They also have a great selection of direct trade beans.

Other than that, the decor was cool, and the atmosphere was amazing. However, that sour espresso made me feel that it's all hype."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. 
Came here based on reviews and how great the coffee is. Well- I ordered 2 coffees ... Both Luke warm to cold and not fresh at all. Blahhhhk
I got my money back. The ladies behind the counter had the audacity to blame me- saying \"perhaps I put too much milk in\". Ha that's comical. I drink several cups of coffee a day.... Enough said. I made my coffee no different. 
Just admit your coffee has been lingering around and not fresh. Yuck. 
The pastry was OKay"}
{"text":"While we were visiting Montreal we had a hard time finding good coffee in the area. The coffee everywhere else wasn't necessarily bad, but I work for Mocha Joe's in Vermont, so I get to drink great coffee everyday.

Pikolo was serving Phil & Sebastian and Heart coffee roasters, which is definitely good stuff, up there with Intelligentsia or Terroir. The espresso shots were single origin and we had Ethiopian Yurko. It was really bright up front and faded into a sort of cocoa as a finish. In my opinion the espresso isn't sour, it's acidic and when it comes to specialty coffee, that's a desirable characteristic. They also have a super nice Mirage espresso machine, weigh out the ground coffee for each shot and used naked portafilters so they (and you if you want to) can see the pour.

The drip coffee was Guatemala La Esperanza. The only thing they didn't have that I wanted was a larger cup, they only serve one size for to go cups which I think was 12oz. That's usually what I drink but as we headed out of Montreal, I really wanted a larger cup for the road.

The Barista's were super friendly, knowledgeable and happy to chat with me about coffee for a couple of minutes. We also tried a variety of their muffins and they are totally worth getting if you want a light snack or breakfast. Overall, awesome place that you should definitely check out if you love coffee as much as I do."}
{"text":"In several trips to Montreal, this is the best coffee I've found. Admittedly, I am not there often but the search for proper coffee is eternal. Pikolo doesn't dilute the cappuccino with too much milk, scald it with overheated milk, or ruin it with burnt beans. Coffee strength is perfect, roast and flavour is classic. This is a treasure in the jungle of cafes throughout downtown Montreal. Merci."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time this morning.  Four stars for the coffee.  Four stars for the croissant.  Zero stars for the barista who sneezed into his hands and continued working without washing them.  Gross.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"got a cappuccino on a rainy weekend and the flavor was slightly bitter, but not bad. the small cafe reminds me of so many in nyc except that it was not jam-packed. 

on the other hand, i am not sure this is all that great of coffee place. my friend and i drank our drinks but perhaps it is that we are used to a lot better (blue bottle, joes, etc. in nyc?). not bad, but nothing to write home about. would i order a drink again? sure, after all, caffeine is necessary to pump into my blood stream."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place that special. Nothing stood out except for the attitude of this one female staff who, when asked to clear the table/bar by the window, asked me instead what mess was there, and never came to collect the coffee cups left behind by the previous patrons. And it was not even busy."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've ever had.  PERIOD.  Best cafe mocha I've ever had.  Cool interior space with plenty of places to sit, chat, or study.  Friendly baristas.  I'd move to Montreal just to be near Pikolo."}
{"text":"Le Pikolo, c'est mon café chouchou, celui qui a été mon rayon de soleil pendant mon séjour à Montréal (oui, parce que côté ciel, c'était gris).
Comme son nom l'indique, le lieu est plutôt petit, les places assises ne sont donc pas légion. Avec une ambiance atelier industriel très lumineuse, on s'y sent à son aise.
Si la carte des boissons ne semble pas révolutionnaire, on remarque à quelques détails l'amour du café. Ce sont donc des cafés soigneusement sélectionnés que vous pourrez déguster sous toutes ses formes : classique, capuccino, latte et même glacé à la belle saison. 
Les thés ne sont pas en reste : avec un joli choix de saveurs, une préparation millimétrée et la possibilité de l'avoir glacé à la demande, les amateurs ne seront pas en reste.
Le choix de petite restauration est, quant à lui seul, un poème. Tout est produit maison ou par des artisans et on apprécie. Entre les différentes variétés de scones, de muffins, le yaourt-granola maison ou les viennoiseries ventrues, vous trouverez votre bonheur pour le petit déjeuner. Pour une pause gourmande un cookie ou THE brownie feront l'affaire. 
Et oui, THE brownie. Sans gluten et sans produits laitiers, c'est de loin le meilleur brownie que j'ai eu l'occasion de déguster. Oui, il est même meilleur que le mien. Un bon goût de cacao, une texture légère et dense (oui oui, tout ça à la fois), des petits morceaux croquants ... ah, j'en rêve encore !
Mon duo gagnant ? Après une bonne ballade au Mont Royal, un thé glacé framboise/champagne. Et une part de brownie, bien sûr :-)"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone else has been drinking.... but easily the worst cappuccino I've consumed. Tasted sour and burnt. Might have gotten a bad one  but couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I would never come here with someone else 'cause it's so goddamn hard to find spots for 2 or more. But that can never deter me away from this cafe. 

The pastries look delicious, all of them, and very homemade. I would say the prices are fair. And the latte here is the best latte I have EVER tasted. The right amount of creaminess, oh my. I had to pay $3.75 for a small sized latte and when I saw that the card machine required at least a minimum purchase of $5 I was a tad worried 'cause I only had debit on me. But the barista still put my card in. And I was like \"Sweeeeeet!\" 

I got to sit by the window, luckily. And the view was awesome. My legs also got to rest on the heater that was right under the high table. And though the place was crowded, it was not too loud."}
{"text":"My girls needed coffee to rejuvenate after our first night in Montreal and although it took some effort and help - we made it to Pikolo.  Pikolo is a chic and minimalist cafe.  Very little seating inside, but we managed to find ourself one little table.  The barista/cashier was a Boston Native - small world!  Great service as he slowly explained the different muffins and items they serve.  I tried their orange/raspberry muffin and was blown away.  Sweet and sour.  Not your average muffin!  My friend tried their cauliflower muffin and although it was strange at first, she seemed to like it more and more.  To the point where she wanted another one!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! We have been missing the coffee from Australia and this place made them just like home! Yummy pastries too. A bit warm inside but we went early in the morning so it was okay."}
{"text":"To be honest, after stopping by Pikolo numerous times during the summer and sometimes during the fall semester for a quick caffeine boost, I still fail to see the hype surrounding this place. Sure, it does have coffee and tea beverages within close proximity to campus, but it's nothing to rave about. They do use 49th Parallel coffee though, which I find to be a bit too acidic for my liking, so maybe that's the case.

This time, I ordered the mocha and a cranberry banana muffin, and, as said before, I found the mocha quite acidic. In addition, I felt as though the chocolate flavor didn't really come through and as a result was missing. Also, as a coffee shop muffin aficionado, I found Pikolo's to be a bit on the drier side, and the flavors of the fruit components seemed to be quite muted in comparison with other muffins I've had. 

Overall, I'll probably just stick to Nocturne (previously Kitsuné) to get my daily coffee fix. Also, they have a rotating selection of muffins on the daily which cater to specific diets, but they're universally delicious! I just might be spoiled too much by coffee shops more deep into the Plateau, I guess..."}
{"text":"L'endroit est très simple mais les cappuccinos (régulier et lait de soya) sont parfaits. 
Par contre, oubliez le déjeuner ou brunch. Il n'y a que quelques pâtisseries, croissants, faits ailleurs. Même pas la possibilité de les réchauffer..."}
{"text":"As far as coffee goes, this is the perfect cup regardless of whether you prefer espresso or cappuccino or something in between (gibraltar, latte, etc.).  Their bakery is also amazing. The croissants are buttery and fluffy and their apple turnover is simply stunning."}
{"text":"I had a latte and a cookie to-go here earlier today, very quick service and the place had a cool vibe. The coffee was excellent, the barista was friendly, and it's located right around the corner from my hotel. I'll definitely be back before I leave Montreal this weekend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"coffee coffee coffee. 

Pikolo espresso bar offers a cosy and warming place to enjoy the best beverage on the planet. The coffee aromas are one of the first things you notice when you enter the building and i was very impressed by their brewing machines. 

They have intimate seating areas made for 2-3 people no more and offer a excellent mezzanine where you feel on top of the world. Its a great spot to sonder or to divide yourself from the hustle and bustle of the main floor. 

The coffee itself was of excellent quality however the cups they give it in are glass and i know they are trying to be different but i found trying to carry two hot glasses up to the mezzanine quite difficult. I think some nice stylish mugs or glasses with handles would not go astray.  For that i give it a 4. 

To summarize, magnificent coffee, chilled vibes, great place."}
{"text":"great latté, only been here once, but it's one of my friend's go-to spots so imagine it's one of the best local coffee shops in town. worth the visit if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Great coffee and espressos!
The mushroom, cheese & pepper scone is perfectly fluffy, moist and savory. A big portion, the scrumptious scone does not disappoint for breakfast with a solid cup of coffee. 
The granola bar was also satisfying, slightly sweet and nutty afternoon treat!"}
{"text":"Having spent the past four years in Montréal, I'd probably have to say that this is hands-down and arguably my favourite coffee-shop on the island (and in the world). Marie-Eve and her staff are incredibly kind and craft lovely experiences for new and old customers alike. 

When this place first opened, it didn't experience too much traffic (which made it a great study spot for McGillians and Concordia students as well as an awesome place to chat for locals). As the word got out about how great their espressos are, it has become more of a transient place to enjoy a cup of java and go on with your day. I sort of enjoy that it has evolved into the latter, as it allows all customers to enjoy the ambiance of the two-floor cafe as well as their beverages and freshly-baked goods. If you're super keen on studying or reading, you better get a spot in the early AM (the closer to 7, the better).

If you know your day is going to be shitty, stressful, or unexciting, the best way to rectify that is by immediately popping into this intimate spot on Parc ave and treat yourself to a latte or a macchiato. If you're having a great day, it definitely doesn't hurt to celebrate by having a piece of the banana-chocolate bread with a cold brew in the summer!"}
{"text":"Started off the Montreal trip by needing a recharge from the redeye flight. Hello, local university coffee shop! According to the Yelps, Pikolo is a favorite of local McGillites (is that a word) that frequent the place for their very necessary coffee re-ups. We were in there pretty early on a weekday morning and found the usual collegiate collection of men in blazers, hipsters, and bearded wonders.

The coffee was indeed good, as was the croissant I ordered. We hung out a while and decided that we were (a) still tired and (2) already loved Montreal. Great start to the vacation."}
{"text":"Très bon café. Local minuscule. Accès Wifi. Copies du Devoir le samedi matin. Une odeur de \"renfermé\" quelque peu désagréable lors de mon passage."}
{"text":"Définitivement un coup de coeur. Le Pikolo est un endroit super charmant. Le café est parfait et les employés sont très sympathiques. Pas le meilleur endroit pour y amener tous vos amis en même temps par contre; il y a peu de place... faudra les amener un à la fois! C'est devenu une habitude pour moi de m'y arrêter pour un espresso qui réveille les papilles pas à peu près. Vive le Pikolo!"}
{"text":"Tried out roughly 10 coffee joints in Montreal and this place took the cake. Top notch coffee."}
{"text":"I pray a latte
Baptize my soul pour over
Awaken my heart

This is a really cool coffee shop. I went here to get good coffee instead of hotel coffee. Great espresso drinks, nice pour over, a pleasant array of pastry. One of the things that I noticed was how beautiful the espresso machine and bar are, take a look. It's pretty tight inside, and seems like more of a to-go place. 

They do get quite busy, and every time I ordered a pour over here, they always looked at the line and were like, \"Well, I guess, but it's going to take some time.\" Yes, that is how a pour over works. So, I think they need to work on a better pour over game face or something. All that to say, the coffee is fantastic and I was very happy it was right around the corner from my hotel."}
{"text":"Visited on an August morning - was quite warm inside. Interior is a bit tired and needs a thorough cleaning. Service was friendly and efficient. Coffee was delicious. Pastries had lost a bit of their flakiness due to the heat and humidity in the space. Would swing by again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Pikolo is a very warm, cozy and hipster-esque cafe with a beautiful interior. I live very close to it, so I have grabbed a quick coffee with friends several times. There are not too many seats so it fills up very easily and can feel a little cramped. 

The coffee is rich and delicious and the pastries are also delicious, but the coffee is a bit more expensive than I would hope for it to be. All in all I like the warm vibes!"}
{"text":"Fabulous coffee and pastries to start the day off right.

Decor has a well worn patina showing the love of coffee drinkers through the years.

Staff were polite and happy.  Steady stream of customers on a Saturday morning.

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"Just your average hipster coffee bar with loads of hanging treepots and Fern. Grabbed a cup of jo and a scone to go, fast and efficient service. Wouldn't expect anything less!"}
{"text":"This is a favourite cafe in Montreal. The coffee is fantastic, and very well made. The selection of pastries is remarkable with both sweet and savoury options (thank you). And finally the small, narrow space creates a warm sense of place. Lovely place to spend 30 min taking a break from the day."}
{"text":"After all the hype, really quite overrated. I wouldn't call the espresso \"exceptional\" in any way. Not bad, but nothing special either.  What is it with Mtl and sour espresso? Pastries I've tried have been pretty good. Nice ambiance, though a bit crowded. Rent is cheap in this city, you couldn't find more space?  Other reviewers are raving about the place as a destination for hanging out, but it's rare that you'll be able to actually find a seat and work, especially if you have more than 2 members in your party.  Staff is friendly but not really exceptional.  Perfectly acceptable, but certainly not the best in Mtl.  Keep looking guys."}
{"text":"I've had better. The rumor mill around this place seduces you, then you get there and you have a taste and you're like what the hell was the hype about? Yeah, it is good coffee. The product is nice. But seriously, nothing to freak out about. It is your standard independent coffee shop that makes an espresso you'll be glad to drink. I won't go out of my way for it but when I'm around the location, I'm glad its there. A solid good choice."}
{"text":"Good lattes and coffee. Good people -- both baristas and the crowd. Good pastries. Great place to relax and get some studying done. Many McGill students seem to end up here, studying. Baked goods are tasty...

Overall, this was a very enjoyable place to taste good-quality coffee and get some work done while seeing the locals live in Montreal. 

Wifi is somewhat slow, which can be an issue."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab a coffee! Love the balcony upstairs for catching up on work and the pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Man, this has become my HAVEN in Montreal!!!  I've tried most of the so called coffee shops around Downtown Montreal...,and this shop out does them by a LONG shot!!!  I only wish I could bring you back to Dallas, Texas where I'm from.  AWESOME place!!!  :)"}
{"text":"En un mot: hipster. 

C'est un mini café avec très peu de places, bondé en tout temps d'étudiants avec leur cahiers et ordinateurs. Qu'importe, je suis étudiante aussi - mais l'ambiance ne porte que très peu à l'étude, avec la quantité de mouvement de gens qui rentrent et sortent de la place.

Très bon café, excellent accompagnements, je conseille de prendre pour emporter."}
{"text":"On a short weekend trip to Montreal, we had 4 cappuccinos here. Very, very tasty. Smooth and delicious. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in northern Vermont and asked ourselves why not drive the countryside to Montreal for a latte and croissant?! Pikolo was our choice destination and it was well worth the trip. The coffee was superb and the croissant quite tasty. We would do it again!

PS: It is a tiny little hole in the wall, so don't pass it by!"}
{"text":"Cute and quick place for coffee. Stopped by and got a latte and Americano. Latte was small (well, compared to Ontario sizes) while Americano was in regular coffee cup size. Also got a cheese and corn biscuit, it was okay but personally I didn't enjoy the whole kernels which were baked in."}
{"text":"This place is just not fair. Such a  flavorful Americano. How am I supposed to pick between here and Kitsume? Nice people work here, too. They also suffer from lack of comfortable seating but perhaps it's by design. I wish every cup of coffee was as good as Pikolo's."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy. Good coffee. Nice ambience. Comfortable place to warm up and relax.  Almost missed it when walking by. Guess that's why name."}
{"text":"yum yum yum yum..Yuuuuuuuuuum!
I am a trained barista. I worked at a cafe for 5 years so I am very picky about my coffee & tea choices. Pikolo is hands down the best cup of coffee I have had in years. I had a soy latte on my first visit and I had to work really hard not to go all Arsenio Hall \"woot woot woot\" up in that shop. On my second (and sadly last) visit, i had the iced peppermint tea which they steeped (loose tea) and iced - very proper like. Soo good. 

I will miss thee Pikolo! Please open up a shop in NYC!"}
{"text":"Super lattes and yummy pastries but whoever was at the cash this morning could work on his attitude, especially when he makes a mistake"}
{"text":"Crowded but good.
I tried to go in the afternoon to sit and have a nice hot beverage but I was surprised at how small and crowded the place was. It's popular good for them but I had to come back later and then wait to get a chair. I took a small mocha and i wished i would've taken a big one because it was so good! There was a great cocoa taste with just the perfect touch of bitterness. It's really nice that the baristas make cute drawings with the milk. that's the kind of small detail that makes me happy."}
{"text":"What an amazing little cafe on the outskirts of downtown Montréal!  After a long day of eating and walking, we managed to make our way down here before heading back to our hotel.  It was a hot day, and despite how badly I wanted to get an espresso drink, it was just WAY too hot.  I ended up ordered a cold brew for myself.  My boyfriend got a cappuccino (crazy on such a hot day if you ask me).

My iced coffee was awesome, and he LOVED the cappuccino.  In fact, we just got back home to Buffalo, and he mentioned how he wishes he could have more of their espresso already!  The staff was very friendly.  The inside is very cramped and narrow.  I think there was seating upstairs, but we ended up getting some seats near the register.

Overall, this coffee place was amazing.  I tried some of the cappuccino, and agreed that it was delicious!  You can definitely taste the passion for coffee that these small business owners have toward their product!"}
{"text":"J'ai passé 8 jours à Montréal fin Juin 2013, j'ai pas mal sillonné la ville et il n'y a qu'un endroit où je suis allé plus d'une fois (à vrai dire 4 fois), c'est le Pikolo Espresso Bar.

J'ai trouvé dans cet endroit tout ce que je pouvais souhaiter.

En premier lieu du bon café et bien préparé même si je n'ai testé que le café filtre, le café glacé et le latté. Les quelques photos sur le mur, le fait de changer de type de café chaque jour pour le café filtre font remarquer que le café est ici une passion.
En second lieu un choix de pâtisserie entre le classique et le surprenant mais toujours d'excellente qualité. Mention spéciale pour les scones aux pommes et cheddar blanc. Un pur délice mi-sucré mi-salé.
Une atmosphère agréable. Le lieu, la déco et la musique s'harmonisent parfaitement dans un style très décontracté.
Même s'il n'est pas des plus chaleureux, le service est plaisant.

Si vous aimez les endroits décontracté et pas classique, Le Pikolo est forcément un endroit que vous aimerez découvrir voir même fréquenter."}
{"text":"Pikolo is really great, with a few caveats.

Lattes are very good, nice and smooth but with a strong taste that isn't too milky. Also their espresso shots are quite good. Very consistent baristas who know what they're doing.

Pikolo is always busy. Always. So you may or may not get a seat. The space itself is quite small & narrow but very charming in its own way. Decor is very Brooklyn with an industrial vibe: great vintage stools and other accents.

They also stock their own blend of Parallel espresso, as well as Phil and Seb roasters (also Wildwood, I believe). Filter too."}
{"text":"Attention hipsters, cet endroit est pour vous. Le pikolo c'est super pour s'arrêter prendre son café le matin. Le cafe est vraiment bon et les pâtisseries aussi. Seul bémol, en tant qu'étudiante, il est difficile de s'y arrêter pour travailler. Les tables sont relativement petites et pour deux seulement, quant à la wifi, il n'y en a pas"}
{"text":"Simply the best coffee in Montreal. I love everything about this little place. They know their coffee and how to make the perfect cup. The lad making it was pretty cute too. Haha"}
{"text":"Best coffee and croissants in town and great service. My absolute fave coffee place, I just wish it was bigger. It's really small inside."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Montreal. Period.

I've been here multiple times and each time I'm more and more impressed. I love the lattes in winter time, and cold pressed coffee in the summer. I've also had the opportunity to take home coffee grounds and enjoy coffee in the comfort of my home. I have to say, I enjoy my latte and cold pressed coffee more than what I make at home, but I guess that just keeps me coming back. 

The scones are literally the best scones I've ever had- they change them daily. The most memorable one I had was with sweet potato, walnuts, and some type of cheese. It was incredible. The staff is also really friendly and make sure to put a smile on your face while ordering and waiting for your drink.

Just writing this review makes me want to go back! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Second best espresso pull of three coffee shops visited today (a compliment).  Very good quality and handling by the barista.  The London Fog was very good as well.  Staff was very personable and the music selection was great.  Free wi-fi enabled us to stay longer than expected and spend more money.  The downstairs can become a little tight because it stays busy, but it was never overwhelming.  Unisex bathrooms.  The woman behind the counter was friendly and charming to everyone."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere, free wifi, friendly staff. But the iced coffee tasted like water. 
The cookie was delicious though!"}
{"text":"Coffee so good, you'll just want it black.  
The vegan blueberry and lemon bisquit (cookie) was also quite yummy, moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cafe in Montreal. The people who work here are incredibly kind, and they make awesome coffee! I go here every time I am in Montreal without fail. The decor is really fun - kind of industrial but still really cozy and comfortable. There is not a ton of seating, but you can check the loft area upstairs too. Such a fun spot near McGill!"}
{"text":"first rate cappuccino- comparable to the bay area's best (blue bottle, four barrel).  a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"J'adore le Pikolo! Le café est extrêmement bien exécuté et l'ambiance y est très agréable (lorsqu'il y a de la place)... Le service est toujours o.k. mais pas désagréable non plus.
Pour un bon café dans ce coin et aller jaser pas trop longtemps, c'est l'endroit parfait !

*They know their shit!"}
{"text":"Pikolo is infamous in Montreal for its coffee and atmosphere. It's got a huge selection of yummy coffee, made from freshly ground coffee beans. Pikolo has got cool beans, indeed. 

As you enter the shop you are greeted with a hanging drape. The drape alludes to the chilled atmosphere inside, compelling you to drop everything and just hang out for a while.

It usually fills up with students on weekdays. You can see a lot of them typing away on their Macs in the back throughout the day. Plenty of gorgeous women, which some can consider as part of the decor ;)

Staff was awesome - friendly and chilled."}
{"text":"Small cafe serving up fresh and delicious roasted coffee. I believe by the taste that they are using 49th parallel which I find is a lighter and somewhat more delicate roast than a dark Italian roast. None the less it's deliciously tasty. I ordered a cappuccino and It was creamy frothy coffee delight. The vibe of a coffee shop is key to their brand experience. Here at Pikolo there was a good steady stream of young urban, local and student feel to the place. It's location may make you double park or have a bit of trouble if you come by car. However if the line is not long it's worth the quick double park as its a pleasant indie coffee house experience."}
{"text":"What can I say that's not repeating the other reviews? I love this place!! And I'm so glad I found it on my trip to Montreal! 

The place is small but cozy and hip. The staff are friendly, welcoming, and fun to talk to. The scones are outta this world good. I mean it. I got the roasted veg scone and it was SOOOO GOOOD!!!! And the latte is top notch delicious. I can't think of anything I'd change about this place. Prices are fair for the quality. Large latte about $3.50. My verdict is,  you should go."}
{"text":"Really good espresso. Strong, very bitter, rich, and complex. It burrows deeply into your taste buds, wow! The sensation immediately woke me up (and shortly afterwards, the caffeine)."}
{"text":"Great coffee (we got cappucino and a not too sweet mocha), a savory zucchini muffin, and a sweet coconut banana bread.  Everything was super fresh and super tasty.  The shop holds maybe 20 people or fewer.  Atmosphere is cute and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This place... is... espresso utopia. The aesthetics of the place is breathtakingly beautiful, their latte art is time and time again flawless, their staff are coffee geniuses, and every shot I saw poured looked beautiful.

As a barista, I'm a bit of a snob about my coffee/espresso. Get your names right, get your consistency right, and if you have an auto-pulling espresso machine, I will be so disappointed.

If you're a Dunkin Donuts/Tim Hortons, lotsa-cream-and-sugar kind of fool, get out of here. You can't appreciate all the effort that this place puts in. If you want an education on how classy coffee can actually be, come in. Make it a point, if visiting Montreal, to stop here-- even if it's a hike up that hill."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere. No AC. Mediocre coffee at best. Homeless ppl by entrance and nearby alleys. Don't know what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Pikolo has changed in small and not-so-small ways since the beginning of 2015, but the coffee still earns five stars. Where it once stood out as my very favourite in Montreal,
I would now rank it in a group of top picks with Myriade, Couteau, Flocon, Dispatch, Pourquoi Pas, and Différance: a jewel in a rich coffee scene.

Pikolo has become a leaner operation this year. There is no more wifi, no self-service water dispenser, and no oven. (Fear not, the same assortment of scones etc. is still here.) The loyalty program is no more, although old cards are still stamped and honoured. Some table space has made way for new shelves of beans for sale. The hours are a bit shorter -- later mornings, earlier evenings. 

The most striking difference may be due to the wifi cut: for the first time I can remember, Pikolo is kind of peaceful and no longer like an annex of the McGill library, with screens and tapping keyboards aplenty. Turnover is faster, and there are usually tons of empty seats (a bit jarring for what was a constantly packed café). I like stability when it comes to my favourite things in life, but so far I am cautiously endorsing Pikolo's new approach."}
{"text":"Apparently one of the top five coffee shops in Montreal. Had their bacon, Swiss, and mushroom scone which was tasty but probably tastes much better warmed (which wasn't an option). The latte was good but nothing I would go out of my way for. It was served in a glass.  This is fine and I enjoyed seeing the layers of my latte.  Here, however, they need to invest in thicker glasses... I could barely hold the glass and I'm one of those that doesn't routinely use sleeves with my coffee (to give you perspective).  

Atmosphere wise.... The music (80s American) was at a good volume to encourage chatting and the decor matched a typical small coffee shop.  The staff all spoke French and English and while okay, we're not overly friendly. Not much seating, but sufficient for a space of this size. It was stuffy however... The only ventilation offered by two fans a ways away on a very high ceiling.

By far the worst thing, however, was that they didn't offer wifi. A cafe this close to a nationally recognized university in 2015 and the wifi is locked?  They had it, just didn't offer it to their patrons.  Seriously?  Even the public bus from the airport had wifi! All in all, an okay place to stop for a coffee and quick snack if it's on the way, but don't go out of your way to get here. 

(BTW... Now I sit some doors down at a Starbucks that I went to so that I could post this review using their FREE WIFI, okayed by the really friendly staff, while sitting in a nicely ventilated space, listening to non-American music ... go figure!"}
{"text":"I'd give a 4.75 if I could. The wait is VERY quick for how busy they are. Coffee is the best we have had in Montreal but the seating is very poor. If you are looking for a spot to get good coffee and pasties in a short amount of time, I would go here. Probably not the BEST place to study."}
{"text":"Coffee is rich and nutty flavored which I love. Had a cappuccino and it was great! 

Funny how they use the same coffee as some very popular coffee shops but the flavor is so much more different...definitely has to do with the way they brew their coffee.

Beware...There is no A during summer so I was sweating my life out as I tried to enjoy my delicious coffee."}
{"text":"A fantastic place with top quality coffee. The staff was friendly and entertaining with a great atmosphere about the place."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to stop by Pikolo while on a short weekend trip to Montreal. Luckily for us, Pikolo was open on Easter Sunday when it seemed like everything else was closed.

The cafe itself is cozy, there is limited seating but has a great loft space with tables that overlook the space.

My partner & I both had lattes. They were so smooth, definitely gave us the morning kick we needed to explore the city. We also had croissants, which melted in our mouths. I'm still craving them a week later.

The staff were nice. They gave us suggestions & managed to keep the lines down despite being very busy. Apparently they have a time limit for patrons. Note to Toronto cafes- please start doing this too."}
{"text":"Pikolo is a such a cute place with a really cozy atmosphere. I ordered an herbal tea which was good and my friend got an incredible mocha. 

This place fills up pretty quickly. Definitely not a place to come with a group of friends. Better for individuals or 2 people together. 

The only negative is that they don't have Wifi."}
{"text":"Pros: Solid coffee shop& menu, Good chai latte, Upstairs seating 
Cons: Busy, No wi-fi, No aircon (prepare for sweat)

-Ambiance- 
A small coffee shop located quite centrally so one can expect a lot of traffic in&out. Would classify as a hipster-ish decor theme. The menu has a few items which is ideal because they concentrate their efforts on quality. Service is friendly. Typical independent coffee shop prices. 

-Drinks- 
Chai Latte: As I am not a huge fan of coffee (don't kill me but like cmon guys think of your breath&teeth :P), I usually go for a chai latte. I was not disappointed with my order because it had a good spice and smoothness to the drink. Really among the tastiest I have tried. 

-Overall- 
Nice place to grab a drink to relax or to be on the go. I did see a lot of young professionals opt for the espresso, so give it a try if thats your thing!"}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem in Montreal. They make one of my favorite cappuccinos in town. I really enjoy the decor of the place. It is a great location to drop by to read a book or study. Sometimes, it can feel very busy as it is a popular spot. It is highly recommended as a great date spot as it's got the perfect mix of uniqueness and busy environment of a coffee shop with special decors. I always recommend the treats as well, baked goods are worth it to compliment your cappuccino."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get a latte.This place is tiny so I usually end up getting my coffee to go. 

I normally indulge in the latte so I cannot comment about the other genre's of coffee. The staff prepares my delicious drink so I trust them to prepare your cup to your liking."}
{"text":"Terrific coffee and pastries! Not a big place, but it has everything you need to start your day."}
{"text":"Pros: tasty coffee, cheddar jalapeño scone was tasty, clean, eclectic atmosphere. 

Cons: expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Sets the bar for bad service. Drinks forgotten and then wrong ones hastily delivered. Barista busy swatting flies and doesn't wash hands before going back to the espresso machine. More lost points for playing generic euro synth dance music. A bummer because try stock really good coffees and seem very popular."}
{"text":"Lived next door and came nearly every day to start my morning. Wonderful atmosphere, the absolute best coffee and the owner is great! Pretty reasonable/normal for a coffee as good as theirs, and their baked goods are a total treat. I always get their lattes, but their brewed coffee is good too, and their tea selection is great!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my Top 3 coffeeshops in Montreal, and the one I frequent most. Like other good places, the menu is no nonsense because they focus on good espressos and derived drinks, but they can probably make anything you ask.

The staff is bilingual, no CC just debit $5 min, all drinks can be served cold, there's free WiFi, and of course having the cutest barista in Mtl doesn't hurt either.

I love the Pikolo Latte and the Gibraltar, the banana bread is a must too!! I think they serve yogurt with homemade jam too, not on the menu. If you're a regular ask for a frequent customer card."}
{"text":"The perfect size coffee and the perfect size coffee shop. Our go to in the area for a coffee and a meeting. Staff is friendly and the coffee and tea is good. Very small space, but hence the name Pikolo. Bar stool and tables and somehow it always works out with the perfect amount of space. A must for coffee in the city. Remember to watch your head going up to the second floor."}
{"text":"As a coffee addict, I find my fix at Pikolo. I stop by almost daily for a latte, cappuccino, americano or filtered coffee. Types of coffee beans are changed daily and keep me from getting bored of the same flavors. The vibe is cozy and welcoming, and customers are loyal. Can get busy at times, but quality of drinks, food and service is never compromised. Prices on the board are reasonably prices and include tax, so no surprises there. 
I'm slightly disappointed they no longer offer their loyalty card, a free cup after every 9; but, coffee is too good to question another cafe. You can't go wrong with any of their drinks and if you see cookies on the counter, splurge, don't even think about splitting with a friend. You won't regret coming to Pikolo!"}
{"text":"This place easily ranks with the best coffee in Montreal. I really like the blend here, and they serve it just the way it should be. If you're after some \"tall\" crap (ie. from Starbucks, etc) then stay away from here, and from me too. I gather from the other reviews that the owner spent time in Australia, so it's all starting to make sense now.

All the pastries look great. I've tried the chocolate blueberry scone and will get it again next time I see it - they seem to vary daily, and most of them look made on site.

The ambience is nice. There's not a huge amount of space (which isn't as negative for a cafe), and it does have a cool mezzanine level. Definitely a place you could come with a laptop and get some work done."}
{"text":"Brewed to perfection - is the only way I have to describe the coffee at Pikolo Espresso Bar. I read the positive reviews and went to try the little coffee shop for myself; an Americano for my husband and a Latte for me, both excellent! The space, featuring high ceilings as well as a second floor, is on the narrow side, however the daylight gives the locale a certain feeling of grandeur. On all occasions I visited the espresso bar, the staff was very courteous and the wait time very reasonable, on the quick side. The Latte itself was creamier than usual, and blended perfectly with the espresso. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"cute little coffee shop near mcgill! pick up some latte, or pikolo latte, and stop by the paper store next door"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great ambiance, decent music not too loud. It met my expectations for a cold day like today. Had an Americano and the place was cozy and great to chill for an afternoon. My friends had cappuccino, nice design on the top. It just missed a nice chocolatin or cake or muffin on the side which they probably ran out of."}
{"text":"Coffee is consistently top quality. Try a gibraltar, skip the Pikolo latte -- it's just too small -- and if you're hungry get a croissant. The espresso will be well-pulled and too much milk will sometimes distract from that. 

Despite being amidst the bigger McGill student study area, it's a gem. The coffee shops around are larger and cater more to students, but Pikolo caters to the person who really just wants a great coffee. To get a seat for sure, come early before the McGill students get up."}
{"text":"Talk about passion, love, quality, and care.

Let's start with the line, which normally it's a good sign of coffee shop. Very small shop and unique.

They have a really good cappuccino, perfectly hand crafted, when it's ready for you to take your first sip. The temperature, foam consistency, aroma, and the roast--all perfect!!

Highly recommended, if you want really good cup of cappuccino, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Warm and cozy feel to it, although congested for my taste. Probably because I'm use to the extra elbow room. Had the chai latte just the right amount of spices, just enough to titilate you tastebuds. Beware the seating is limited."}
{"text":"The coffee is decent, the ambiance a bit too hipster for my taste, it looks like customers are required to have an iPad to be allowed in. This is a place where people come to nourish their narcissistic complex and their gluten-free paranoia, it is a temple for Crohn's disease, whether real or most likely imaginary. I had a gluten-free mineral water with my gluten-free coffee with soy milk (God forbids I drink regular milk)...and it was scrumptious. Life is worth living and the world is a better place because of Pikolo"}
{"text":"Great looking spot...would have loved to taste the coffee but my americano wasn't ready after waiting 20mins...can't really say it was good since I had to leave before it was ready!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Place vraiment mignonne située près du méro Place des Arts. Je n'ai entendu que de bonnes choses sur ce café, on me disait que leur espresso était de qualité et que je devais essayer un latté. Toutefois, j'ai voulu tester le chai latte car je suis une grande fan. Je dois dire que le leur est particulièrement épicé, à vous en brûler la gorge, et malheureusement pas sucré... Tout est une question de gout mais il est loin de rivaliser avec ceux que j'ai essayé ailleurs et celui que je fais moi-même. Toutefois, excellente localisation pour les étudiants, bon service très courtois et sympathique. Si vous arrivez proche de l'heure de fermeture il ne reste plus beaucoup de choix de viennoiseries... ;("}
{"text":"It's my first time exploring around Montreal. Every time I'm in a new city I like to check out cafés and their cold brews, if they offer it. Although the size was a tad smaller than I expected, the cold brew coffee at Pikolo was REALLY GOOD! Smooth, great flavours and tones, and no bitter taste at all. I'll definitely be going back before I head back home for another cold brew. If this place had wifi, that would be even greater- but for a stop-and-go cafe, I did enjoy it quite a bit."}
{"text":"Super great cappuccino and flat whites. I could drink these all day long. Nice service too. Small, but funky place."}
{"text":"Stayed in Montreal for 5 days and one of the biggest regrets was not hitting up Pikolo in the beginning of the trip. My bff is one of the biggest latte lovers and we both agreed PIkolo had one of the best lattes we've ever had. I'm obsessed over iced americanos (which was good here) but almost wanted to order a latte too after I tasted hers. 

Not sure what more I can say. 

Oh yes it was also sort of a warm day and they didn't have a/c on and we were sweating a bit ordering but we found this to be true of many establishments. I can't imagine how delicious a hot espresso beverage would be in the winter."}
{"text":"Loved the mocha drink but the latte my fiancé had was mediocre."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe! My husband and I got iced lattes on a hot and humid summer day which was a perfect little treat. The coffee flavor was superb but a little too creamy for my liking. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Its simple to review a place like this. 

Its a small hipster café. If you can get a seat, it may be an okay place to go on your computer for a while, but if you need a couch and a lot of space to do work, it definitely wont be too comfortable for you. 

As for the coffee. It is robust and has a more tarty profile, just how I like it. Good job on choosing a tasty bean. Baristas are also skilled...meaning they know how to make their coffee based drinks well."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee place, they know what they are doing. The space is small and always full."}
{"text":"I had discovered this place online before coming to Montreal and it was also recommended to me by a friend. Needless to say, I was excited to try the coffee at Pikolo! In the end, I was a bit disappointed. My macchiato was alright, though did not live up to the hype. Good for a coffee if you're in the area, though not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffe shops in town! 
If you are looking for a Cozy, small coffeeshop with friendly staffs, and great quality of lattè you should go to Pikolo! If you want cookies/pastries too try to be there before 2pm as all will be gone after!!"}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about Pikolo I had to try it out and it did not let me down!  The coffee here is excellent and they always do a little foam art in your coffee which is a nice little touch.  I get the latte usually which always hits the spot.  Their baked goods are also worth trying.  I've only ever had the brownie but it was a mighty good one!

Just note that the cafe is kind of small so seating can be hard to come by especially when it's exam time at McGill.  The cafe is located in the heart of the McGill Ghetto so it's a popular study spot.  Don't let this discourage you from checking it out though.  It's definitely a great coffee shop."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to croissants n caffeine. However, this place was packed (good sign) and they had only a few baked goods left (bad sign). You're not garunteed baked goods and they only carry a few items, so whatever is left is what you're gonna get. We came here mid-afternoon on a weekday and were surprised so see how busy they were. Limited seating, hipster-vibe, and over-priced (but well-made) lattes and coffee."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! would def drop by again the next time I'm in town. 
You can get a small sized Pikolo latte when a full sized latte is too big. 
Creamy and smooth and friendly staff. 
Has a nice section of pastries too."}
{"text":"Un chouette café mais sans plus, l'endroit est sympathique mais il y a peu de places, de plus, si on peut resté aussi longtemps que l'on vit pour bouquiner ou bosser, il ne faut pas compter sur la connexion internet plus que vacillante. 
Les cafés sont toutefois bien servi et les employés sympathiques, tout comme l'ambiance qui y règne."}
{"text":"Feels like I have already passed by Pikolo quite a few times and finally tried it today. It was sooo good, the americano with the spinach pastry made my day. And I wish it could have wifi in the future."}
{"text":"Belle petite ambiance, les lattes sont délicieux et bien beaux :)
La mezzanine est bien jolie et accueillante pour prendre un café entre amis.
Le personnel est aussi très sympathique !"}
{"text":"One of the best espresso bars in Montreal. Coffee is high quality and the baristas are very professional. Internet is reliable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, quite relaxing and good to meet up someone or to study, the decor is not that sophisticated but nice overall. I ordered a cappuccino and it's very good! Price is fair too, so it's a convenient little coffee shop to go if you are around McGill/ Place-des-arts."}
{"text":"Best espresso. Was a great stop in the morning for some caffeine and to warm up. Very kind service too. Don't forget to ask for coffee art!"}
{"text":"Came back again ! Definitely the best coffee place in Montreal. Oh and the baristas are cute too! Even though the iced soy latte was $5.70 it was definitely worth it ! Definitely on par with the coffee culture in Sydney Australia !"}
{"text":"I too stumbled across Pikolo by complete accident, but it wasn't open as it was late at night. I promised myself that I would venture back there in the morning for a little quality testing.

I was not disappointed with my first visit. My latte was superb and it tasted so fresh...the owner whose name I'm not yet familiar with is extremely friendly and gracious...the chocolatines and other pastries are either made or baked on site. While delicious, the chocolatines were a bit too greasy for my taste. The space is cozy and well appointed, there is also a little mezzanine for upstairs seating, tables and bar stools by the window so you can watch passers by on Avenue du Parc.

Pikolo is welcome addition to this charming and constantly evolving neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a great little joint that coffee snobs will appreciate.

The shop itself has a cozy, comfortable space. You're first greeted by a its distinctive green mouldings on the front windows, with a classy art-deco appeal, and you know this is not your faceless Starbucks or Second Cup. There's not a whole lot of room here to sprawl out and set up an all-day workspace (you know who you are), but for a hole in the wall it has good light and charming atmosphere. If you don't see a spot at first, check upstairs, where there are a few extra tables that you might not notice upon first glance. 

The coffee is nice. The baristas know their stuff, and the result is beautifully foamed milk and espresso pulled just to your liking. They also have a delicious cold brew, which seems to be something of a specialty item around here. The blueberry-lemon scone had just the right mix of crumbly, squishy, tart and sweet. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cozy little café near McGill University serving coffee roasted in small batches from two collaborators, one in Calgary and the other one in Portland (Oregon). Quality is consistent, without a doubt, despite the small scale production. 

Apart from the regular types of coffee beverages that are offered, the Pikolo latté is one of my favourite orders whenever I'm in town and I'm in a rush. In a nutshell, the Pikolo latté is a small-sized latté served in a glass a little bigger than a shot glass. Coffee extraction is done a little more concentrated so the coffee taste is more pronounced, which makes this baby latté more reminiscent of a creamy espresso than a latté. 

Coffee is the main reason to drop by Pikolo (the café owner trained in Australia for several months), but pastries are also worth a bite: either all made in store or bought from local Montréal bakeries, products are definitely ethical and fresh. Since I don't have a sweet tooth, I usually grab the granola that's freshly made every morning for a couple of bucks.

For students who are looking for a study spot: the relaxed, casual atmosphere makes it really tempting to stay and study, but since it's a small café, tables are stools are rare to come by.

Bonus points: last time I was at Pikolo, a barista was wearing a 49th Parallel T-shirt!"}
{"text":"Pikolo Espresso Bar is THE one!

The best espresso drink we had for our weekend in Montreal as we looks for a good cup of espresso.

Cappuccino ($3.48) & Gibraltar ($3.04) both nicely done. My first time ever tried Gibraltar which is a double shot of espresso with just a touch of milk. The drink was strong and really gave me the boost I needed! The cappuccino was strong but yet mellowed by the nicely foamed milk.

Pikolo has this really laid back vibe. Free wifi and tons of outlets. High ceiling and with a lot of windows letting natural light in!

I can stay here and sip on my coffee for a long timeeeeeeeeeeeeee.............."}
{"text":"First cafe in Montreal. Early ih the morning, sip a polo latte. What  a day !!!!!! The decor is excellent"}
{"text":"We dropped by this cafe as our last destination before leaving Canada. Pikolo offers exceptional coffee, though the space itself is quite small. The baristas here remind you that coffee is to be enjoyed as they meticulously make each cup of coffee. T and I were in awe as one of the baristas pulled out a scale and timer for a pour over coffee, plus the little kettle. She spent a solid 5-8 minutes making that one cup as we sipped on our lattes. The flavor for both our normal and Pikolo latte was nutty and chocolatey, with no bitterness whatsoever. I recommend this place for no frill, barebone coffee, but don't expect an internet cafe bustling with millennial (like a Starbucks)."}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious pastries, awesome staff, bright and beautiful atmosphere--just all around good cafe vibes. Pikolo's one of the many quintessential cafes found here in Montreal; ahh you people here are so lucky to have so many great cafes in your city!"}
{"text":"Visited from San Francisco and felt quite at home in this narrow little cafe. Espresso bright but balanced. The baristas were knowledgable and attractive. I got several excellent food recommendations out of them and some regulars. This cafe makes me feel like I could move to Montreal and everything would be alright."}
{"text":"J'aimerais tellement que ce petit café soit plus près de chez nous. C'est le café de Montréal qui ressemble le plus à ceux que j'adorais quand j'habitais en Australie. Les lattes sont délicieux - le ratio lait et espresso est parfait et ils ont un goût très bien balancé. Il y en a pour tous les goûts avec des scones salés, des croissants, des petits muffins super originaux (bleuets et fromage, dates, carottes et ananas) et d'autres pâtisseries qui remplissent le café d'une odeur qui les rendent difficile à résister. L'endroit n'est pas super grand, mais il ont un aménagement qui permet quand même à plusieurs personnes d'y passer du temps. L'internet est super rapide et ne lâche jamais. J'y suis allée originalement pour un seul café mais j'y ai finalement passé plus de 2 heures parce que j'étais tellement confortable."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic coffee. Tasty tasty tasty espresso, perfectly frothed and poured lattes. The best coffee I had in Quebec and I would say equivalent if not better than Stumptown stateside. 

Service was fast and unpretentious. You can tell these guys love what they do. When I come out to Montreal again I'll be sure to drop by again."}
{"text":"Wow.  Character, style, substance (great coffee).   So cool, so good."}
{"text":"We ordered a cappucino, and cold brew, both were delicious. we sat in the window to watch people walking by.  Friendly service for us non-French speakers. Be sure to stop by the AMAZING paper store next door!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little café!! Excellent coffee, friendly service. They make their drinks fast while maintainig the taste consistent and doing different milk foam designs! They have just a few tables but clients are welcome to sit as long as they would like."}
{"text":"This review is based on the soy cappuccino that I got here. 

This was a rather eye opening experience for me. Literally. This strong pull of espresso jolts you awake from the very first sip and leaves a tantalizingly bold but not bitter aftertaste that just awakens the senses with every subsequent bit imbibed until the very last drop. 
The coffee was made to perfection.

It's definitely the best cup I've had to date this year."}
{"text":"They use 49th Parallel coffee which is one of my favorite roasters! Delicious cold brew, small location but had tables to sit at."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I was searching for in a Montreal coffee shop :) Small, quirky, full of local character, and also full of delicious coffee and staffed with talented baristas. 
We had an espresso, a cappuccino, and a rhubarb and lemon scone, and everything was delicious. I like my coffee strong, and these were. It's such a great spot to grab a few stools and have a nice conversation, read a book, or do some work. Perhaps it's because we came on a rainy Sunday, but there was plenty of space and it didn't feel crowded. They have a super cute little upstairs (loft-style)."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice atmosphere. Liked the muffins."}
{"text":"For the week that I am staying in Montreal, this is my local coffee shop and I feel that I really lucked out. It's also the only place of its kind in the area as far as I could tell. The coffee is stellar, the vibe is cool, the pastries are delicious, and it's conveniently located up the street from the metro. The staff is friendly, bilingual, and has great taste in music. This place is a total win in my book."}
{"text":"Pikolo. As the name suggests this is a tiny place. 

+ Consistent coffee, I always take the Americano. It's good. However their espresso tend to be almost on the bitter side. Good cold brew. I wish they didn't fill half of the cup with ice, but hey. If you are getting it, it must be hot outside anyways.
+ wifi with no problem
+ chic people around. You feel good :)
+ tasty treats. 
+ gluten free/ vegan friendly. 
- tiny tiny tables (downstairs). It's ok to read something, but working with a laptop? Forget about it. Unless you sit under the stairs, then you have no light plus the ceiling is kinda low. If you like to study in the spacious places this is not your cafe. Go to Kitsune. 
- quite large tables upstairs. But you again don't feel spacious.

All in all, good place to
+meet with a friend 
+read a magazine or an article

Not good for studying, unless you are an absolute minimalist."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, great service and the decor is very cool. Worth every drop. They serve their coffee quite short, so beware."}
{"text":"delicious latte!! and it's a big latte! It's out of the way for me, I didn't live too close. But I adore Pikolo for the wonderful coffee and the peace it gave me as I window (or creepily) watch the streets. I visited Pikolo as a break from apartment hunting, managing moves, etc etc etc. I'd be living in Montreal for the next 6 months, and Pikolo was THE best place for me to pause."}
{"text":"Your typical hipster joint. Overpriced and bad coffee. I'm a regular coffee drinker and i don't know what they're serving. This place is obviously overrated and attracts people just by their reviews. For $20 there are way better breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"Coffee was great, but no AC and no room to sit. Loved the vibe of the place, and it seems like it's very popular. People kept coming in and out, so you can tell it's very well known. I just wish there was some sort of cooling system, especially on hot and humid summer days."}
