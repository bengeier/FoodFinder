{"text":"Food was fantastic. Steak cooked to perfections, sides were delicious, salad was as well. Very good"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on along trip and were richly rewarded. Imaginative menu with both standard American food and some fascinating fare possibly created by the owner. Rich sausage soup ably prepared. Fried calamari decent; portions generous. Special treat for us! Tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean.  On Saturday pm the bar, which looks like a fine place for locals to gather was not occupied but \"Oakmonters\" were engrossed in lively but polite conversations. Richly rewarded for getting off the beaten track."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very eager to try this place under the new ownership and glad to see that it was back in business.  However, it couldn't have been a more disappointing experience.  The food was blah - nothing special.  My tuna was overcooked and dry.  The service was horrendous.  It was a Saturday night and not busy, yet our waitress had a very hard time keeping up with her 3 tables (2 people per table).   I asked for extra sauce for my tuna, and she brought me a tiny cup with 1/8 inch of sauce in it.  I guess that's all they felt they could spare.  It was also FREEZING inside.  I sat there with my husband's ski coat on my lap for 20 minutes before I could flag her down to see if she would turn on the heat.  The atmosphere has changed too.  It used to be dimly lit and romantic.  This time the lights were so bright it felt like we were at the dentist.  The waitress knew I was unhappy with my meal, and she said \"well, that's how it always is.\"  I was so displeased that I immediately emailed the owner when we got home.  That was 3 weeks ago.  No response.  I always think when it comes to bad service, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  The new ownership leaves a lot to be desired.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"We were a group of four and decided to sit at the bar because it was a little crowded. The ambiance was nice and seemed like a happy neighborhood restaurant.   We all had different entrees but the bartender put our order in properly and kept our glasses full. We received our food in a reasonable amount of time and it was cooked perfectly.  I had a fried chicken cutlet, served on a biscuit, with pan gravy with a salad and a side of potatoes. It reminded me of visiting my grandmother in North Carolina. It was so tasty and tender and the biscuit was soft and delicious. The other entrees were just as good. This will be a weekly stop for us from now on."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and was excited to eat here again.  When we called to make reservations they refused saying they were booked for an event later that evening. I asked if that meant the restaurant wasn't serving dinner before the event and the waiter said they were. The event didn't start till 6pm and we wanted to come for an early dinner at 4:30pm. The hostess hesitated and said they couldn't guarantee a table and they would have to rush us out. So we told them to forget it. Bummed we didn't get to eat their again."}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood joint. Small, well finished interior. Tables tightly placed together, no sound dampening makes it difficult to hear your dining companions. Great, classic hardwood bar area, TV's muted to sports channels. Service was slow at times.  Food well priced for what you get - heaping portions of healthy, modern gastropub food. Chicken and fish dishes (I sampled the tables) were tasty and well seasoned.  Sauces, condiments and dressings are PHENOMENAL. They best any $50/plate restaurant. Salads are mixed greens. Each entree comes with 2 sides. Steamed veggies were crisp and well seasoned; sweet potato fries were spot on.  Wine and beer list are extremely well priced - Woodchuck is $3/bottle.  All in all, it's a great neighborhood restaurant. It's not fine dining, it's not casual - and it hits the spot.  Two things are worth coming back for, time and time again: the sauces/dressings/condiments and the well priced alcohol list."}
{"text":"Great food and service..  Not a burger place but had the house burger since it sounded good..  Long story short, it will break your heart..  Really good food..  highly recommend the flat breads.."}
{"text":"No prices on the menu.to me that means everything is expensive.i had a ceazer salad 9.95 it was fresh and very good. The food that was being served to other custemers looked very good as well.how ever i would never return do to the fact they their are no prices on the menu.the restaurant is in Oakmont not Hollywood. But if you can what ever You want on a meal go ahead and stop in."}
{"text":"What a cute place and awesome food. The peppered strawberry salad was large  and yummy. Steak sandwich was great and the fries were better than normal fries. Stop and check it out. Rebecca was great"}
{"text":"Incredibly confused as to how a restaurant, of which most typically emphasize hospitality, can remain in business AND how it has such a high rating. I came in alone because I am traveling on business and was greeted in an unfriendly manner, as though the server was completely shocked that a party of one would be dining in. The server stood far away from me to greet me, take my order, and pushed my food onto the table in the most literal form of \"dropping off\" rather than putting it remotely close to me. The Maryland crab cake was fried which was the biggest disappointment (but also why you don't order MD specialties outside of MD). My fries were cold by the time the server finally brought me ketchup, which I asked for three times! When my meal was totally insufficient, I asked to order a side salad and again, was met by confusion from my server. I ordered the beet salad which appeared to be sliced beets that came from a can. Unbelievably terrible service and the one compliment I was going to throw out there was the fries were decent but even that is a stretch. Unless my server was an alien who never has eaten in a restaurant, there's no explanation for why the service was so despicable. Don't bother unless you're local, I guess. I would absolutely give this place no stars if possible."}
{"text":"Food was great, took about 30 min from ordering until appetizer came out. Will be back"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.. everything was amazing from the drinks to the satay chicken.. to the pasta diablo to the coconut shrimp.. we will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"We go here all the time, and I've never had something I disliked. The crab cakes are especially awesome."}
{"text":"A really nice homey restaurant in an area where you might not expect to find anything worth trying. I tried this place for dinner on a recent business trip based on the reviews. it certainly did live up to what most people say about it. I ordered grilled salmon - not a very risky choice but one that often provides a clue to the quality of the food. It was very tasty, cooked to my liking and well-seasoned. This is a small place that has definitely been there for a while. The decor is bland and during the week, seems to attract local baby boomers. My only complaint was dessert - I ordered carrot cake and it was very cold, like it had been in a refrigerator for a while to try to keep it longer. Other than that, the food and service were great. Will visit again if I have the chance..."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, kinda tucked back from the main road a bit but was extremely happy when I found it. My wife and daughters love the home made salad dressings, take your pick they are all good. I got the avocado salmon with butter sauce and it was cooked perfect. The staff was cordial and happy to cater to my daughters ages 2 and 4. We also ordered dessert, carrot cake and raspberry Charlotte which were both very good. Never heard of a raspberry Charlotte until this visit and I will never forget it."}
{"text":"Small, cozy.  Food is A+, service is very good. The only problem - the noise level is simply staggering.  We could not even hear our waitress telling us the specials - and she was standing right at our level as we sat at a high top.  That amount of noise is a full-on sensory assault and really detracts from the dining experience. Too bad, because my dinner was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambience. Great service. It was nice to relax and not be rushed.  Had grilled salmon with avocado for dinner...amazing combination and delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow, the place looks like a dump on the outside, really cute on the inside with candlelit tables and a few big tables for groups. Greeted quickly and seated promptly. No drinks in menu, bar takes up most the space inside. Small menu and very high priced. 14 for a piece of fried chicken on a biscuit with pan gravy and 6 bucks for a Caesar salad with mostly the butt of the lettuce in it. She got the fish and it came out very light in color. Had little to no taste until one huge spot of the most rancid dirty fishy fish taste. I got the steak sandwich with Rostand red potatoes and wow was i disappointed. First bit had the hardest piece of gristle or a bone in it ever and then the rest was iffy at best. Pieces of decent steak and pieces of the worst hardest chewiest steak. The red potatoes were more like small burnt rocks on my plate. And the smell in there was weird to describe at best. Service was poor. Our waitress was more attentive to her conversation at the bar with the bartender and other server than to us. I seriously would not return there if you paid me to. The bread that came to the table was good though and while being described as from the oven it's wasn't barely room temp and was clearly just a sliced baguette, but thank god it was there!!!"}
{"text":"Truly, this one star review was earned by The Might Oak Barrel for its grotesque decor, failures in adequate service, disappointing fare, and overall lacking quality for a restaurant in the famed downtown of Oakmont.  My colleagues and I hosted a well-respected Oakmont resident at lunch at somewhere other than the typical Hoffstots or Chelsea Grille. This was our first occasion to visit the \"Barrel.\"  Upon entry (around 1230pm) we were treated to a most disturbing collecting of horrific art, Fiesta-ware plates, and no oak barrel (a place called the \"Mighty Oak Barrel\" actually has an oak barrel, right? Nope...). On the wooden bar rested a clothes basket filled with unfolded table linens, a work-in-progress schedule of servers, and a hodgepodge of cleaning supplies. This was not during the late afternoon \"slow hours\" where you might expect to catch the staff cleaning and organizing, rather these chores were being completed on the bar, in the middle of the restaurant, during the lunch rush.  One woman acted alone as the sole bartender, hostess, waitress, table busser, and cashier. Although I do feel bad for her having to act in every possible capacity other than the cook, I do feel her employer needs to reevaluate its business plan. After an incredibly long wait, our orders were taken - but nothing served without error.  The food that was delivered was nothing to impress (see the burned beyond reason Reuben I could not bear to finish).   ...Any good review must evaluate the restroom and this is one to note. The men's restroom lacks a door on it's only toilet stall and lacks any locking mechanism on the main restroom door. Better hold it...  In the parking lot leading to the front door, a smelly and filthy grease trap sits prominently to great patrons.   I would not recommend visiting The Mighty Oak Barrel."}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped for lunch on Saturday. Not many people here. We ordered salad with champagne dressing, tomato bisque, fish sandwich and steak sandwich. Everything was excellent. The cod was lightly battered and very fresh. Tomato bisque was flavorful, great piece of steak in the sandwich and fresh salad greens. Nothing to criticize except if you like your food \"easy on the salt\" this may not be your place. I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Wine tasting at the mighty oak barrel was fantastic!!! Great food and wine! I highly recommend these wine tasting events."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Crab cakes were some of the best I ever had. Had the Reuben and fries-delicious. The house salad with Champagne dressing was amazing. I really enjoyed the food. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Went today at opening.... Staff eagerly awaiting, and within minutes, the place began to fill up.  We ordered the soup of the day: Tomato Bisque.   The temperate was perfect, and the taste devine.  For our lunch, we had the salmon sandwich.   It was a wonderfully broiled salmon piece served with bacon and lettuce on a rye bread.   It was recommended from our server, and it did not disappoint!  Thanks Mighty Oak Barrel!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night for dinner. The food is awesome.  Service is fantastic.  Price reasonable. Plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this place for lunch one day ! Creative appetizers! We had the Jerk Chicken Satay with an avacado ranch and a stone mustard for dipping! Super tasty!! Also had the beet salad and a peppered berry salad. Yep you guessed it! Super tasty!! I had a bunless angus burger and it came  out plated well! My wife had a flat bread with red peppers and sausage. It was good also."}
{"text":"Very good food. Certainly well worth the price of each entree. The house salad was great along with the Salmon and Pork Chops that both my wife and I had. Even my son was digging the cheese pizza. Would come back here next time in town."}
{"text":"Great food (seriously some of the most flavorful I've had in a long time)... great waitress... and a hostess with an attitude that gave us the \"you're not a local so we don't want you here\" vibe. We arrived tonight (a Wednesday) at 5pm for an early dinner after a long day at work. We were asked how many in our party(only 4 of us) and asked if we had a reservation; when we replied no, we were greeted with a gruff huff of attitude as she tried to figure out how to place a party of four at the only available table of four left (that didn't have customers or a reserved sign already). She then exclaimed that next time we should know to book a reservation. I get it, it's a small restaurant (10 tables max with a large bar area), they want a heads-up, but we are from out of town and had no way of knowing that. Immediately made me think I was going to leave a one or two star review. Our waitress and her upbeat personality and the amazing food bumped this up to a four star (yes, it's that good)! I ordered the tomato bisque instead of their salad to start (but heard from my coworkers that the Italian dressing was one of the best they had) and was very impressed with the flavor. Had the two filet dinner with red potatoes and broccoli (the picture doesn't do it justice)! Steak was tender and cooked perfect! Potatoes were well seasoned and garnished with basil which paired perfectly with the sauce on the steak! I would definitely recommend eating here, but would definitely recommend going early (it really started to get busy around 6) and would SERIOUSLY recommend a reservation so as to avoid the same sour note that our dining experience started with!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the wine which gives The Mighty Oak Barrel its namesake, but I can definitely say the food was delicious. Seriously high-quality appetizers and entrees for an appropriate price (a fellow diner I was with got duck, which was $22 for a smallish portion, but that's about the only overpriced offering I noticed).   I personally had the Jamaican jerk chicken, as well as a wedge salad, and both were truly phenomenal. The menu isn't huge but offers a wide variety of cultural cuisines with some sauces and sides that are a bit more elevated than your usual sit-down place, like ratatouille, green beans almandine, carrot cole slaw, etc.   Our service was outstanding. Our waiter balanced the art of checking on us too little and too much perfectly. He was very attentive , and also saved me tons of money by substituting someone else's salad for the iceberg wedge I ordered, which I greatly appreciated.   I would've dressed a little more nicely if I had known more about The Mighty Oak beforehand. It has low lighting and nuanced decoration, and is small/personal. It's a great place to bring a date! I thought it might be more of a casual place, but it definitely is more appropriate for a slow, quiet dinner with good friends.   The Mighty Oak Barrel is an all-around great restaurant with emphasis on quality and service. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Returned on 4/29/17- service at the bar is improved. Food still rocks  -------  This place came up from the ashes when the new owners ran it (family). They're not here, and it's sliding back into the ditch. Food good/Service suck.   The food is very good, but the experience not so much"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had their veggie burger it was very good. The texture was pleasant and had tons of flavor. This is a small quaint place and gets packed on the weekends. Their portions are just right and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"This is a quaint elegant restaurant in Oakmont Pennsylvania.  We had an awesome dinner starting with warm bread and fresh whipped butter, then entrees which were tastefully displayed and made with fresh ingredients followed by the best cherry tart ever! Our waitress was pleasant and fun. Special touches I noted were the comfortable music in the background, beautiful artwork on the walls and tables with small and larger groups all having a good time. I would highly recommend this newly reopened wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and showed up late on a Tuesday night.  They were already cleaning up but happily invited me in, I was the only one in the place!  At no point did I feel rushed or feel like an inconvenience.  Had a great glass of wine and ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Satay appetizer to start, it was a very generous portion, cooked perfectly and tasted incredible.  The accompanying 2 sauces were both delicious, I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole plate!  My main dish was the Grilled Chicken with Mushroom that came with a salad and 2 sides.  The salad was fresh and tasty, best I've had in a while.  My entree was, again, cooked to perfection, juicy and along with the sides was awesome!!  I can't say enough about how nice they were and how good everything was!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Duck here.  Rates are reasonable as well. You get a soup or salad and a side with entrees.  Great wine selection and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A family-owned restaurant with a great wine list in my own neighborhood? Yes, please! My husband and made a reservation for 8pm and were promptly seated. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive.   We each loved our wine choices - and both were reasonable for the quality at $9/glass. We started with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with Horseradish Aoli. At $13, I feel this appetizer was a bit on the expensive side but, as I'd heard, the sauce was outstanding. We both moved on to a Spinach Salad with Peppered Strawberries, Red Onion, Goat Cheese, Egg, and Candied Walnuts. It was a delicious iteration a traditional spinach salad - and both my balsamic and my husband's raspberry vinaigrette were excellent. For dinner, I had the Twin Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese and Port Wine Demi Glaze. The meat was expertly butchered and cooked; the sauce was a good consistency and flavor; and, my portions of the two sides - green beans almondine and roasted red potatoes - were gigantic. My husband had the Stuffed Lobster Ravioli in a Cream Vodka Tomato Sauce, which looked a bit small on the portion side; however, he cleaned his plate and I didn't hear any complaints.  Our entire bill--two glasses of wine, an appetizer, $2 upcharge on the salad choices, an entrees (which included the two sides)--was only $85. I find this to be extremely reasonable for piping hot, fresh, well executed food that (1) I can walk to and (2) can support my local economy. We absolutely plan to make this our new \"spot\" for date night!"}
{"text":"Took my MIL here for her birthday. We had really great service and they have a great wine list. We had the fried calamari and the cubanelle peppers to start and were impressed by both. Our salads came next and were massive (which was a nice surprise). My husband and mil both had the rabbit ragu pasta.  It had nice big chunks of rabbit. I had salmon with a side of rice pilaf and Brussels sprouts. It was a very generous serving of salmon. My one complaint was that my sprouts were seriously undercooked (they were basically hard and unseasoned - which is why I gave 4 stars and not 5). Overall we enjoyed the food and felt like it was well worth the money. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, now family owned (non chain) restaurant.   We had tried this place when it re-opened and again recently.   They worked out the opening \"bugs\" and are much better organized.    We had burger, flat bread and crab cakes.  All were excellent.  If you were here under old owners vs new, it is different with its own, new unique flare.    If you read my other reviews, I am all about family owned.  This is well worth the stop."}
