{"text":"The place was very clean, but I wasn't there to dine in. I tried two items to go. Their mild wings were seasoned just right and delicious and the 14\" flat pizza (not Chicago style) was so good, it was halfway finished before I got home. Fortunately, it was cut into small slices which made eating while driving easy."}
{"text":"This place gives me the peace of home i have been missing ..to bad tge first time i go no more deep dish because people are to impatient to wait for a good thing.. But i had to give the owner a hug a thank him for bringing me home. The best will be back especially when the pizza puffs get on the menu ... PLEASE BRING BACK DEEP DISH FOR THOSE WHO DONT WANT TO WAIT CALL AHEAD THEN PICK UP..!!!"}

{"text":"I tried to call last week to order & no answer.. same thing happened again tonight. Must be a sign I shouldn't order from here which sucks because they're right across the street from me!"}
{"text":"Stopped by one day after work since it was near home to get a Gyro and an Italian Beef.  Was a little hesitant since everytime I pass by, there are no cars parked in front of the restaurant.  Food was alright.  Gyro meat was a bit on the dry side, not enough Tzatziki sauce even when I asked for extra, asked for a wet Italian Beef, not wet enough.  Oh well.  Nothing for me to rave about.  Decent food, nice people, just was a bit surprised that their prices were a bit higher and portions were a little less than Windy CIty.  I'll think long and hard before going back  So for now, I'll stick with Windy City."}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef in NV and there Pizza was great. I have been there twice now and the Chicago Hot Dogs were fantastic. Nice atmosphere. I live across town and it is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"After seeing the sign for this place last week, we decided to try it today.  Did not see any evidence that it was there.  Did it move?  I know another poster said the doors were locked on Saturday, so I'm guessing it is no longer in business.  Can anyone provide information?"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, wings, fries and chilli cheese dog. Food was okay. Rating 1 star for overall experience (food mediocre, food cold, no utensils/condoments included, inaccurate food description, not satisfied). Wings were okay. Chilli cheese dog had a soggy bun but was okay. Pizza was thin crust, not chicago deep dish like description said. Paid for extra toppings (Pinnaple & pepperoni that were an additional $1.50 each). Save yourself the time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"#1 management was wonderful  #2 food was fantastic we even got some to go The Chicago dog felt like home and the place is wonderful to dine in.  Its my new place to hit up for a fast and great bite. I give them 5 stars (:"}
{"text":"Finally a real deal Chicago restaurant in Las Vegas. So many in the city claim to be authentic but not close. Chicago Cravings hands down the best in Las Vegas I have ever had. They truly are the real deal."}
{"text":"Love this place it's the best food that's just like chicago! So far we tried the gyro beef and pizza all amazing"}
{"text":"The pizza is very authentic...but it's not the THICK MULITLAYERED Chicago style pizza that they have pictures on the sign in front of the store... but still extremely good.  The Chicago dog is great! The couple who runs it are so nice... VERY CHICAGO."}
{"text":"Tried to order.  They didn't have a delivery driver and couldn't give a time when they would have one.  Not a great start IMO.  I was looking forward to trying a new Pizza place.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great home style food and excellent service. Stop in and check out Kurtis' Chicago flavor! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Open Sundays! A delicious departure from McPizza of the large chains.  Large onion and green pepper strips instead of diced is a nice touch.  A variety of crust thicknesses to choose from.  The medium or thick crusts are best bets."}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago for 20 Years and ate at the best restaurants.  This place is Hands down the best Vegas will ever have.  For Tony H, get a life you have no idea what good Chicago Beef is.  Their beef was so juicy and flavorful and nothing close to Potroast. Better than Windy City and Als Beef.  The owners are great people and keep the restaurant very clean.  If your expecting 5 star, go to the wynn.  If you want great food and service with a smile, Chicago Cravings is the place."}
