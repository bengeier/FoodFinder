{"text":"I dropped in without knowing much - it was packed. I picked 2 appetizers and a bowl. All were excellent. I am going back again today."}
{"text":"So glad this place is around, it's my favorite ramen in the Oakland/Squirrel Hill area. The miso and kimchi ramen are my favorite. The tan tan is really good too, and probably the most food for your dollar. Usually very fast."}
{"text":"I got gyoza and shoyu ramen. Both pretty good! Service was very good as well. The egg was delicious and the pork was melt in your mouth. Only thing is that the broth was a little fishy for my taste but otherwise delicious and hit the spot. It's awesome to have a ramen place so close to campus."}
{"text":"Affordable and generally decent grub with passable service. Wouldn't be especially excited for a return visit, but it wouldn't be a bad choice. If you're hungry and in the mood for noodles, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Definitely one of the better noodle places in the general area."}
{"text":"TLDR; the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  I wasn't really going to try this noodle place because I don't think I'm that big of a fan of japanese ramen. BUT I came twice and here it is:  First visit: I ordered the chicken katsu curry bowl. The chicken katsu was good, but there wasn't enough curry for the amount of rice given and the piece of bokchoy that was on the side was not fresh at all. I came with a friend to catch up and what not, so we were having conversations and I guess the waiter kept thinking we were done eating/talking for some reason because he dropped off the check and continuously kept coming back and opening the check to see if our cards were in there. Obviously, our cards would not be in there if we weren't done eating and ready to leave... But he came three or four times and I was getting fed up with it. I placed my elbow on the check so that he would know that the check isn't ready. But he still came to check it. We still had food in front of us and were still in the middle of conversations but he would still interrupt our time. I really have never had a worse dining experience than here.   Second visit: I tried a japanese ramen this time because that's what they're known for so why not. I ordered the shoyu ramen. I just don't think I'm a fan of the flavor of japanese ramen. So I can't critique on what the ramen comes with and how it's supposed to taste, but I have to say that the ramen was pretty salty... And my two friends who ordered ramens as well said the same thing. As for the service, the waiter seemed like he was trying to get us out early. When it wasn't even that busy during the time we were there.   I personally am not willing to come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying ramen and the staff was nice enough to explain the differences between the bases of the soups and make a recommendation. I got the tan tan ramen which was awesome and had lots of meat in it. It wasn't too spicy so I order some kimchi (awesome!) and threw that in too. The staff were very attentive and I liked being able to watch them prepare everything--and notice how clean the kitchen was!"}
{"text":"I went here to try real Ramen, and I can't say wholeheartedly that I was a fan. I felt pretty limited in my choices based off the ingredients for each of the meals, therefore, I tried the the spicy seafood ramen. The flavor was very rich. The seafood in the bowl included shrimp and squid. I waited approximately 10 minutes for my to-go order which wasn't bad at all. I haven't been back since, but I feel like I need to try ramen at other places before making a final decision. Truth be told, Oakland needed a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it was still under construction and I finally got a chance to try it! I'm a fan of ramen, but I find that a lot of places overcharge for a bowl of noodle soup. However, the prices here cater to college students and are very affordable! My kind of place.   The service here was great; our waiter was friendly and attentive. Space was clean, which many Asian restaurants aren't. Another thing I really appreciated was the condiments at each table for your soup, which included spicy red pepper and fried minced garlic. While I thought the ramen was pretty good, I really enjoyed our appetizers: takoyaki and pork buns. They were the perfect size for sharing.   If you're looking for decent, inexpensive ramen, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"After almost a year of renovation(?), this place finally opened.  There are a lot of options on the menu, which can be a little confusing.  We ordered Shio ramen, Katsu curry ramen, shoyo ramen and Tan Tan ramen. I got the shio ramen, which came with different noodles than others. The noodles were a little hard, and I was disappointed. My husband, who ordered the curry ramen, gave me some of his noodles and they were a lot better. So I asked the waiter if I can get a new bowl because to me the ramen seemed not fully cooked. The waiter was nice and gave me another bowl of ramen. Good service. To be honest, the broth is definitely lacking some richness and depth compared to the newly opened ramen place in downtown called Yuzu kitchen. But the price is lower so I guess you get what you pay for.  I believe the ramen broth is the soul of a ramen bowl, so this place is just average."}
{"text":"** More like a 3.5 **   I don't think it's that bad for the Pitt area, however it's nothing great. Everything seemed like it was made before, because the only thing even remotely \"piping hot, or just hot\" was the noodles and broth. The ramen comes with one tiny fish cake (cold), 3 pieces of chasu (delicious but lukewarm), and literally 2 pieces of menma. It's good enough to eat but there's clearly not enough manpower or ideas to run a well-made ramen restaurant that's unique. The broth is miso and it's clearly just the paste.. no additional effort and it still sells at $10/bowl.  Ordered the katsu for appetizer - size is fine, but it was lukewarm also and the fried skin kept falling off.  The place is also TINY (to be fair, they get people in and out quickly), but don't expect to come with large groups. The biggest table is for a table of 4.   Definitely needs improvement, but people will continue to come since it's the only ramen joint in the area."}
{"text":"First time in a Ramen noodle house. Food was good service was great and the place was packed. Will return to again"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times and I've gotten the chicken katsu shoyu ramen each time. They give you a really good serving size of katsu and ramen and the katsu is actually really good! Best i've had so far in pittsburgh. I had the curry katsu rice once too but I prefer the ramen (was a tad spicy for me).   The service is great too the ladies who work there are really sweet!!"}
{"text":"The service is fast, the price is relatively normal and the options are numerous. As an additional plus, they package the broth and the noodles separately which is perfect for lunch on the go. My challenge in rating this place is that the noodles taste very much like boxed ramen, everything from consistency to overall flavor. However, the meat is one of the best things I have tasted in a soup ever and the portion size is relatively good. I started at three stars but if you're a boxed ramen fan then this really is a four star flavor, if you expect more from your noodles or want a little more direction in the purchasing experience (service is not particularly friendly one way or the other) then you might want a more amicable, mom's kitchen feel type spot but for those of you running through Oakland who want a quick bowl of soup that won't slosh around and spill on you on your way back to the office then there is certainly no harm in checking this place out"}
{"text":"I came in on Friday afternoon with friends in a group of 6. We were attracted by the \"Grand Opening\" sign hanging at the front door.  The restaurant is a bit small where there are only tables of 4 and we ended up sitting at the bar table.  I love ramen but this place is a bit disappointing. There are many choices on the menu while most of them look like the same. The Shio soup and Curry soup is just fair to me.  Noodle is too hard.  The sprouts are cold.  Pork is a bit fatty. 3 stars are more than enough for the food. The only pro in this place is their price. They took 10% off the bill if you pay cash. Noodle is 10$ each ($9 after discount) which is much cheaper than ny.  So I add 1 star for the their pricing. I would not suggest my friends to come for their noodles and I may not visit this store again when I pay my next visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love the Tan Tan noodles with an extra egg! They are so flavorful and the noodles are perfectly cooked and super tender. The dumplings and Spicy Seafood Ramen are also delicious. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I tried out Zen for lunch and was pleased! After seeing the \"coming soon\" sign for so long I was ready for some noodles! I had the chicken yakisoba and ordered it spicy.  The noodles were delish and the chicken was well cooked. It wasn't spicy at all to me though.   The space is a bit small,  only about five 4-top tables and a row of bar seats so large groups wouldn't work well here. They have free wifi and had a great playlist going today!  I'll try it again for ramen... maybe going with one of the dishes marked spicy to see if that helps!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends a few months ago and was super thrilled with the quality of everything, especially for the price. Oakland prices are generally pretty low, but this is a huge bowl of noodles with meat and veggies and everything for $10, which is unheard of where I'm from. The ramen was really tasty -- I especially enjoyed the egg. I also ordered takoyaki, which came covered in flavorful sauce. The bonito flake that came on top of the takoyaki was a bit much, but I was able to get most of it off without trouble.   Service is really fast, making this a great place to come even during busy times in the year. If you're a student looking for a bit of a nicer meal that doesn't require getting on a bus or breaking the bank, Zen's Noodle House is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing! I couldn't pronounce what i ordered but it was fantastic!!!! I like this place over the one I've gone to in squirel hill and also in east liberty"}
{"text":"Excellent! We came on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered the pork gyoza and both got the chicken katsu curry rice. Everything was made to order so it all came out hot and fresh. The dumplings were flavorful as were the spices inside them. Although you could not pick your spice level for the curry, it was spicy enough at medium (which is how it comes). We got a ton of rice and had to take half of it home. We also got extra sauce to go. Our only complaint was they only filled the container ¼ of the way for an extra $1. We would have liked to have it completely full or at least ¾ of the way."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm split on this review. Came in on a Tuesday afternoon for a quick lunch and the restaurant was running it's usual lunch rush but I saw a table waiting to be checked out and cleaned so I thought quick turnaround. I asked for a table for 2, the lady proceeded to tell me 5 minutes.. 5 minutes passed and I'm just waiting for her to tell me again another 5 minutes. 10 minutes passed and I asked. I didn't get my table till 15min later when there was clearly a table that just needed to be cleaned. Not sure why the waitress and another fellow waiter felt the need to tag team to clean the table together but when seated, I had to wait another 5 minutes to place an order and no water/tea in sight. Not to mention, she didnt sound happy taking my order at this point. I have a 30min lunch break and let's just say, I missed a session because of terrible service.  I was famished so I had no choice. The only highlight that gave this review 2 stars is the food. The ramen was superb, flavor was on point! I'm not sure why they hired these wait staff but I'm utterly dissatisfied. Not sure if I'd return for lunch again."}
{"text":"I was excited when I walked in, got my bowl of ramen, took a picture. Butttt, when I pulled up the noodles they looked odd, put it in my mouth and the texture was just not right. The ramen was quite hard or stiffy-ish? So that was kinda the deal breaker. Other than that the soup and toppings was good."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good! The ramen is definitely the go to. We came on a Thursday night and had to wait at least 10 mins for a table. The service was pretty good even though it was busy.   Unfortunately, I did not like the Japanese fried rice or the chicken popcorn like appetizer. The fried rice was plain and tasteless and the chicken was mostly batter with no meat. The ramen was really good though. The broth was very flavorful. I would definitely want to try the other ramen as it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Oakland has finally opened this restaurant. The kimchi ramen with chicken was very good and spicy and so much food. Will def go back and order this. I get very picky with meat and the chicken was good enough for me and tender and no fat chunks. Also tried the squid and shrimp but it wasn't very spicy and not as flavorful as the kimchi ramen, squid looked fake. Kinda expensive at 11 dollars but I get two meals out of it. The dumplings were small but tasty. Ordered take out and they packaged the liquid and veggies/meat/noodles separate which is nice. It's no noodlehead but it's right next door for hospital staff and students so very convenient. Only waited like 6 minutes for my take out."}
{"text":"After literally several years in development, this place is finally open! And not even as what it was originally advertised to be, which was Lanzhou noodles. This restaurant is now a solid Japanese ramen restaurant, which miscellaneous offerings of donburi, yakisoba, and apps. Somewhat interesting that it finally opens now, when ramen places are seemingly popping up all over Pittsburgh. From the price point and feel of the restaurant though, it seems more accurate to group it with the older places like Ramen Bar and Love Ramen (formerly Love Yogurt). The ramen bowls are priced at $10/11 and the ambience is quite casual, fitting in with most of the other Oakland restaurants nearby. For comparison, others like Ki Ramen or Yuzu Kitchen are more formal settings with more extensive menus and ramen bowls costing up to 50% more.  The ramen selections here encompass the usual shio, shoyu, and miso varieties, where each item has different combinations of ingredients. They also have curry ramens as well as tan tan, kimchi, and seafood ones. When we came in it was late at night and no other customers were here (perhaps also because they just recently opened), so our ramens came out soon after ordering. It looked quite authentic--it contained all the ingredients promised on the menu, and the size was large enough to be quite filling. The broth was immediately impressive--very savory and decently thick, giving you a warm feeling in your whole body. The noodles were cooked just right and not too firm nor too soft. The chashu was extremely tender, with maybe just a bit more fat than I would've liked, but it was not a dealbreaker in any way. The runny egg was also cooked to perfection with the right consistency. In all these factors, this ramen solidly beats out Love Ramen and Ramen Bar, and is at the same time cheaper than some of the other places that I mentioned. The other ingredients in my bowl were the standard accompaniments and made the bowl delightful to finish.  This is a great addition to Oakland, and I definitely look forward to coming back and trying more of their ramens and maybe non-noodle dishes as well."}
{"text":"Ramen was ok, but chashu was good though. Kara-age was not true Kara-age. It was Tatsuta-age. I would probably not go back to this restaurant if this is in our neighbor."}
{"text":"Yes, No and OK.  Nice to have a small soup noodle house in the area. There is nothing better than a big hot soup with noodle on a cold winter day.  Yes, there is one in Lawrenceville, one in Squirrel Hill, but not Pitt campus. So I am glad this finally opened.   Inside is small. 4 tables for 4 and a row of bar tables (seats 8?).  Each table/bar-seats have access to a power outlet, so that's a plus.  We went for dinner and was served by a waitress. At first, I thought it was a serve-yourself diner by the placement of the cashier. Maybe that was for take-outs or lunch, i dont know.   Foodwise, we had Takoyaki (octopus balls), Spicy Akamaru Ramen and Seafood Ramen. Most noodles are about $10 each, which is reasonable.   Takoyaki (octopus balls) is $6 for 4.  I like the size of the appetizers, just a bite or two without filling you up. I wished the shell of octopus balls were harder. It was not undercooked, but it was on the softer side.   Spicy Akamaru Ramen was a pork noodle with shio soup. I actually like this one a lot.  The two spicy soups were similar but this one with pork is better. It has more depth.  The only downside is that the pork was slightly too fat.    Spicy seafood Ramen was the low.  I agreed that the seafood was under-seasoned.  It felt like frozen seafood (which they are) straight out from the freezer. Prefer the pork ramen much more.  Overall, I will give it another try for their non-spicy shoyu soup.  It is a convenient soup noodle house. Like the location, though there are better Japanese food around. . Street parking is easy after 6pm."}
{"text":"Now that they've been open for a while and I've been back many more times, it's time to update this review.  Newcomers in the Pittsburgh ramen scene make Zen not as great as it used to seem in comparison.  Now, Zen's ramen noodles are good, but what really stands out is their chicken katsu curry.  The curry sauce is thick and spicy, and the chicken is tender and crisp."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  Whenever we arrived at Zens Noodle house shortly before 8 PM there was only one other customer in the restaurant who was just finishing up.  So for almost the entirety of our dinner we had the place to ourselves which didn't bother us at all since it was cold outside and PITT was on winter break. The inside consists of a dining room on one half of the restaurant with the cash register and kitchen (clear glass so you can see into it) on the other.  The walls are made of black tiles with a cool sheen to them and have a light gray grout between them that makes it feel less dark.  For dinner on this evening my wife and i decided to split the octopus balls for an appetizer and then I went with the hot and spicy seafood ramen for my entree.  Our octopus balls came out first and looked great having been fried to a nice golden brown with some sauce and bonoto flakes over the top.  I really enjoyed the flavor of them as well, especially with the bonito flakes. The only thing that I didn't like about them was that some of the bigger pieces of octopus inside of the balls were pretty chewy.  Still, it was a delicious start to the meal.  Almost immediately after we finished the octopus balls our ramen was served to us.  Much like the octopus balls, they looked good whenever they were first brought to the table.  The hot and spicy seafood ramen consisted of a spicy shoyu broth with shrimp, squid, fish and mixed vegetables.  Out of the seafood I liked the shrimp and fish quite a bit but found the squid rings to be rubbery.  The real star of the dish though was the broth which was absolutely delicious.  It was complex and had a nice slow heat to it which kept on building up in intensity the more that you ate.  That meant that by the end of the meal I was coughing a bit from the spice level even if I didn't find it to be too spicy.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our meals here and thought it was the perfect meal for a cold night."}
{"text":"The Takoyaki tastes really good. Crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. Noodles were  also delicious. But they did not make a huge impression."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I am not from the Pittsburgh area, so I have no frame of reference to other ramen places near here.   The service was quick and friendly, the menu was concise with all the classic favorites (vegetarian, pork, beef, chicken, and seafood options)  I got the spicy seafood, and my better half got something with pork in it and broth on the side.   Loved mine, excellent broth and noodles as perfect texture. The seafood bits themselves were a little under seasoned, but the broth more than made up for it. The pork bowl was also well received, had excellent seasoning. Wasn't sure if we were supposed to pour the broth into the noodle bowl or just take them separately, but it was still delicious.   Will definitely return whenever in the area  Pictures attached"}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen expert. That being said, this ramen didn't wow me. I ordered the mixed vegetable ramen with veg broth. The veggies...baby bok choy, mushrooms, scallions, shoots, corn, carrots, etc...were fresh and the ramen is lovely. I'd love if they had tofu to add. I got my food to go so they separated the broth and it transported well this way. The staff is friendly and helpful. I had to communicate that I didn't want pork and she recommended the mix veg ramen. The portion was a large filling lunch for me. I might return since it's so close to where i work but maybe I'd try the chicken ramen to see if there is a boost in flavor."}
{"text":"** Best ramen place I have had in Pittsburgh. Affordable and decent portions along with a wide variety of options.   Zen is a ten. Hold up... looks like I may have found myself a new ramen spot in Pittsburgh. I know I just posted in my last review that I do not believe there is good ramen in Pittsburgh... but Zen proved me wrong. Very reasonable prices (around $10 or low teens), a ton of different options on the menu, and decent sized portions. On top of all that, it's on the edge of Oakland so accessible to college students.  When I first walked in, the savory aroma of the broth filled the restaurant, which gave this place a promising start. I ordered the spicy seafood ramen, which left me satisfied (apparently I am quite hard to please). It came with a variety of shrimp, fish, and fish cakes, and of course vegetables and noodles. Only thing that was missing was an egg, but that can be an add on for an extra fee.   Broth was very flavorful as is necessary in ramen. The spiciness level was perfect - enough to stimulate your taste buds but not too much to the point where its painful. The noodle texture was on point and chewy but not too hard. The variety of seafood just topped off the bowl. I particularly thought the fish pieces was a hit, as it added a nice szechuan spicy fish remix.   The only downside is that there is limited seating (around three or four tables for four, and a bar table for maybe 8-10), so don't come with a group bigger than four. Likely to have a wait if all the tables of four are filled."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Newish restaurant opened a little down the Oakland area, and it's already coming up on people's radars, which is a good sign.  The place is pretty small, but features a nice view of the open kitchen, and there is a variety of bar and booth seating.  In terms of the food, I thought the takoyaki was great! There was a generous serving of octopus, and the sauces weren't too overpowering that many street vendors tend to do. The ramen, however, I thought wasn't stellar. The soup is really bland, and the noodles are just so-so. The flavors definitely don't give hints of authenticity or anything exciting, which was a bummer, but at least it was agreeable.  Pretty average ramen overall, but it's still a nice place to stop by if you're feeling hungry for some noodles."}
{"text":"Stopped by recently for lunch.  Despite the somewhat limited seating, we waited less than 5 minutes for an open table.  Service was spot on, our server was incredibly welcoming and hospitable.  I ordered shoyu ramen (soy sauce-based broth) and although it was absolutely delicious I couldn't help but wonder whether the flavor was actually any different than their shio ramen (salt-based). To be fair they both have a lot of salt..  Overall a great dining experience for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited this place has FINALLY opened after what seemed like being forever in renovations.  It's on the same block as my office so it's a great place for a lunch spot for me and Pittsburgh really needs some good authentic ramen places.  As you walk in the ambiance has the feel or a real authentic japanese ramen place with a ramen bar and some tables to sit at.  The menu has a nice variety of different types of Japanese style ramen, as well as some appetizers like takoyaki.  I had the miso ramen which was quite tasty and flavorful and the egg was perfectly soft boiled.  The pork was delicious and tender. Most of the ramen dishes were about $10.  Unfortunately they don't have a tonkotsu ramen which is my favorite, and so far I haven't been able to find it in Pittsburgh.  The server was very attentive--almost TOO attentive as they seemed to be really trying hard to do a good job since they just opened.  I'll definitely make this a regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I've been here twice on two separate occasions and have not left disappointed once. The first time I got the Gomoku ramen because I wanted the bokchoy in the broth, but it wasn't worthwhile since there was only one half piece. The second time I got the shoyu ramen and man was that a filling meal.  The amount of noodles they gave was sufficient to fill even my guy friends, although I have to say I took my leftovers home and enjoyed them later. The charisu was so soft and tender and very flavorful. The egg was sweet and soft in the center. Honestly my favorite part! On a cold winter evening, the soup warmed me right up. And charisu isn't the only meat that's good! The pan fried chicken was also very tender and delicious, didn't taste try and tough  and definitely better than any breaded chicken I've had. It wasn't white meat, maybe dark meat? In any case, the staff really knows how to make their ramen. We got takoyaki in addition to the ramen. It came with the moving fish flakes and packed with sauces on top and flavor within. Soft and chewy, a little spicy from the mayo I assume, and sweet from the other sauce! It wasn't my favorite because I personally am not a fan of octopus, but I would recommend it to anyone who is!   I would definitely come back. You have my vote!"}
{"text":"I stoped by zen shortly after noon. It was really busy, there were not many tables and most of them were very full. I had the miso ramen, it was excellent for pittsburgh. I thought the broth was reasonably good. They do offer takeout, so you can avoid the long lines. For the grand opening, you get 10% off for any cash purchases."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu shoyu ramen was delicious and with all the random rain the city has been experiencing it's a perfect meal to accompany this shitty cold rain lol.   I am huge on the broth and it has to have that depth and it wasn't hitting that note for me here.  Although I need to explore the menu more.  Next on the menu is the Tan Tan Ramen!  However for convenience in location from work this place has quick service and quantity is huge.  It's one of those places that you may become a regular if you're in the area on a daily basis and cut short with time to getting food.  At least that's what this place has become for me :P"}
{"text":"What a great change of pace! We walked in and were seated right away. There are booths along one wall - each one with a power outlet - and counter seating facing the kitchen. We wanted everything in the menu so we'll probably be back to try the other options. I got the ramen and tonkatsu chicken.  The ramen was great but the chicken just so-so. About the time we finished a lot of people were waiting for tables and we felt a bit rushed to get out, but somehow it didn't bother us. We had a good time."}
{"text":"Overall not a great experience... Went for lunch on a work day, the restaurant was full of students and there was only one waitress. Took a really long time to order and even longer to get our food. Also they just serve you what just came out of the kitchen instead of what you actually ordered so you have to be careful and reject food that you did not order. The ramen was mediocre, same texture as instant noodles but the soup and meat was great. Also waited for like half an hour to pay... Would not recommend going during busy hours."}
{"text":"Had yakisoba, ramen and takoyaki. All of them were decent but a little bit salty."}
{"text":"Meh.  I expected this place to be average, and it was. Vegans and vegetarians only have two options: Kimchi ramen sans chicken, or veggie ramen. I opted for the latter and ordered it spicy.   The broth lacked complexity and was overly salty with a touch of sesame oil and a little heat. The noodle to broth ratio was also off- too many noodles, not enough broth.  On the bright side, everything seemed pretty fresh, and the variety of veggies included in the dish was impressive. Woohoo, bamboo shoots.  Glad I tried it, but I won't return. Try Umami or Ki Ramen for a better bowl of noodles, with a more complex flavor. 3 stars because it wasn't the worst ramen that I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food was great but the host was very rude. I was sitting at the bar eating and the host asked me to move chairs, While I Was Eating. Instead of waiting for my reply, he picked up my food and started to move it while i was putting my fork to my mouth. Will not visit here again."}
{"text":"Great for Oakland, okay for Pittsburgh. As an employee of university, there are few options near our space in the medical school. The noodles are very good and the bases are pretty tasty. I don't understand their super sweet egg. Pretty average for ramen places in Pittsburgh but an exceptional addition for the void in the university area.   FYI: lunch is always a shit show, get here early."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this might be the best spot for ramen in all of Pittsburgh. I had the spicy Akamaru ramen, and overall it really satisfied my ramen craving. It was flavorful and just spicy enough to make me tear up a little. It was, however, a little salty (1 star off). The umami was there, but it was dominated by the salt content. The tender charsiu and sweet seasoned egg were the highlights of the dish! The service was great: fast and accommodating. I ended up paying about $16 (tip included), so I would say this place is on a pricier side if you're more on a budget, but not unusual for a ramen bar. The portion was fair, but could be a bit bigger for its location. Overall, it's a solid place for ramen and I cannot wait to go back to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the place and ordered ramen for takeout. I was hesitant to go in since it didn't look promising from the outside, probably because they have random objects stacked up on the storefront. But the inside is very clean with the kitchen set up in a bar style. Small, but decent amount of seating. The bar style seating is perfect for people eating alone. Quite a few options and friendly staff. All the different components of the ramen were packed in separate boxes. While I appreciate the effort, the amount of plastic made me feel guilty. The ramen itself didn't blow my mind and so the three stars. The broth wasn't as flavorful as some other ramen I had before.   I'll give it another try before giving up on this place. This place is however liked by quite a few people from that I could gather."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick place to eat on campus! Service is fast and friendly, and I like that the menu has a wide variety of options.   I've been twice, I got the chicken katsu shoyu ramen and curry ramen. I think the katsu is what makes this place shine, it's cooked well and the katsu is nice and crispy! I wish that the broth had more flavor, I felt like it was a little bland, especially because I got the curry ramen once and was hoping the broth would have a lot stronger of a flavor.   It's also a pretty fair price for the amount of food you get. I'm probably going to come back several times because this is another great on campus option!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for so long it has been pretty sad. I work in Oakland and walking past this place for the past few years I have seen the banner go up, then the steps put in, then the ramp, and then the inside renovated. Each time a new thing that happened my co-workers all rejoiced. We could not wait for this place to open. When it did, I sent a text and no one believed me, I had to take a picture with the open sign for everyone to get on board and come out.   So yesterday I packed my lunch and then promptly forgot it in the fridge. I thought it was about time to come here and try it out. I was also feeling a little bit under the weather and I thought soup would really hit the spot. Yum. So I walked over and stared at the menu before deciding on the Miso Ramen.   The staff was really attentive and the place was packed, that seemed like a really good thing to me. I got the Ramen to go and let me tell you, the service was super fast. I was surprised that I got it so quickly. Something that I really appreciated, and only saw when I got into work with my to-go bag was that they put the broth in a different container than the noodles. That way nothing was mushy. Yum.   The Miso Ramen came with charisu, fish cake, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, egg, scallion, and pork bone. I was honestly super surprised at how big the portion of this soup was. When I got to the office I could not believe it! The soup was really good. The broth was flavorful and amazing. And the noodles weren't mushy at all. The noodles were also packaged Ramen noodles, or at least they tasted like them. So if you were looking for other types of noodles I do not think that they had other options. I liked the Ramen Ramen-ness of the dish and having these noodles were awesome. Oh and that egg, done to perfection. Yum! I was full and warm. I would pick this again in a second. This was a really good bowl of Ramen. I think that in the Oakland area one of the best places that I have tried in a long time.    The rest of the menu also looked really good so I cannot wait to come back and try more. Just know if you do the portions are big so be prepared."}
{"text":"Out of the four Ramen places I have been to in PGH, Zen is the only, single, solitary place I would go for ramen.    The ramen broth and toppings are far superior than the rest.  The charsiu has a great balance of fat a d meat and you get 3 of them on top.  The other toppings include bamboo shoots, corn, seafood cake, soft boiled egg, etc. based on the bowl you choose.  There is even a curry broth version you can eat with a super crispy chicken katsu that is quite delicious.    The menu also offers decent appetizers and also choices for one of the best fried rice bowls I ever had here.  The yakisoba noodle choices hit the mark if you want dry noodles!  Overall, I recommend!  Check'em out!"}
{"text":"The ramen are pretty good. I order dandan don once, it was too salty!! The pork bun is tasty as well."}
{"text":"This place is more like a 3.5, but I'd rather round up than round down. The ramen here is great! I ordered the miso ramen and requested that they make it spicy. The broth was rich and flavorful and the chashu was perfectly cooked (my 3 slices were so tender they barely stood up to the chopstick).   The noodles were definitely not fresh, but that would have been asking for a bit too much for a small shop in Pittsburgh. Still, Zen's is the best ramen in this city.   They also give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner. There is limited seating, but it is enough. Some people do take out and order at the counter but they do come and take your order once seated. I went with the spicy akamaru ramen and my friend had the spicy seafood ramen. The broth was spicy and yummy at first. However, after a while it just became difficult to enjoy. It seemed like the spicy broth was just dumped with sriracha or a hot sauce. It was just too concentrated. Overall, a decent place to grab some ramen if you are craving it. However, I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Really good ramen! It's been a while since my last visit so I don't remember what I got, but pretty much everything here is on point. There really is no way to go wrong with the ramen here. Great staff and service too!"}
{"text":"I like the noodles which they served. The seaweed salad also good. One of my suggestions for the restaurant is the cook time could be longer to make  takoyaki more crispy outside and the sauces on the top could be the mayo mix sugar instead. Trust me and try it, it could makes them better to perfect!"}
{"text":"I've never had true ramen before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I really enjoyed my food.   I ordered the hakata ramen to go, and it was made quickly. The broth and noodles were separated, so it was easy to carry and the noodles didn't get soggy during transport.  It tastes very good, the broth had a lot of flavor.    The restaurant itself had minimal seating, it's definitely a takeout sort of place. There are a few 4 person tables, but nowhere to put any together for a group. Then, there is a counter. I liked the look of the place though, seemed very modern.   I will most likely eat here again, and it's a nice addition to Oakland."}
{"text":"I had the veggie ramen here and I really loved it! You can choose between a pork or vegetarian broth, which was awesome. I also added an egg for $2 which at first I thought was a little pricy, but the egg boasted a ton of flavor. The restaurant was packed at lunch time, but the staff works very hard and efficiently to get everyone's orders in and out quickly. Also- the portion of ramen was large and I got two meals out of it!"}
{"text":"Came here just before dinner rush hours on a Thursday night. I had read here that the seating was limited because the space was small. I'm glad we came early because they were right. There's only about 7? tables, maybe less. We were seated quickly and served quickly. Food was very hot and tasted good. The spicy seafood ramen wasn't very spicy and the broth tasted like it was lacking something but I couldn't put my finger on it. Overall, I will be coming back here again in the future to try out other offerings."}
{"text":"Wowza! I'm really diggin' this place! I've had plenty of ramen in Pittsburgh, so I went in a bit skeptical. I was immediately proven wrong.   We were seated right away and our server was quick and attentive.   I ordered the Hakata Ramen. The added red ginger and bok choy sold it. Every bite was amazing from the perfectly cooked, marinated egg, al dente noodles, bright zing of ginger, and the melt-in-your-mouth pork roll. The broth was rich and flavorful and needed no accoutrements. Mr. J was equally impressed with his Shoyu Ramen.  The Takoyaki appetizer was also delicious. The octopus balls were creamy and tender with a sweet and smoky sauce topped with smoked tobiko."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! We came yesterday for lunch right before noon - definitely get here a bit earlier if you can, otherwise you'll be waiting for seats for quite some time since the restaurant is very small.   I ordered the Gomoku ramen, which came with straight noodles instead of wavy. The food came out very quickly. I was impressed with the ramen. To be honest, I was not expecting much since my ramen experiences in Pittsburgh have generally been bad, but I thought their broth had a nice, rich flavor and their noodles were cooked perfectly too. The egg had a bit of sweetness to it which I enjoyed, and their chashu, though on the fatty side, was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth. Besides the egg and the chashu, the rest of the toppings were nothing to rave about. Although it wasn't the best ramen I've had, I think it's one of the best ramen choices in the city. Prices are fair for the amount of food that you get too.   We did feel a bit rushed by the waitress to pay our check, but I think it was overall understandable since they were so busy and had such a long wait. I'm glad this place is in Oakland now and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for soooo long, I'm sure y'all know. It's been \"coming soon\" for a whole year or more. I came here on a cold day with friends to get some delicious ramen. I was just a little late so my friends ordered my food for me. But the waiter insisted they don't want to serve them food until I arrive so the food won't get cold. It's interesting.. anyway, the food was good and most ramen soup on the menu are range I think from $10-11. I got miso ramen soup. I think it's good, but I'm not excited about it. I'll give it another try in the future, maybe other noodle soup will be better. My boyfriend got chicken katsu and I tried it it's phenomenal! I'm definitely just happy pittsburgh has another ramen place :)"}
{"text":"They don't have many vegetarian options on the menu, BUT they do have a vegetable broth that you can get with mixed vegetable ramen. I thought the veggie ramen was good, but not amazing. It was not particularly flavorful - you could blame this on me for not ordering a more traditional pork ramen, but I have had better vegetable broths at other establishments. The vegetables with the ramen were fresh and pleasantly bright!  I came here with a friend who is a regular customer. He knew of a few \"secret menu\" items, including shrimp katsu, which is basically fried shrimp on a stick (I do eat some seafood). The shrimp was quite good, very crispy and served piping hot  The food here is cost-effective and good, but not particularly memorable. I would be more inclined to give a higher rating if these items were actually on the menu"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a group of friends for dinner tonight. After seeing this place under construction for so long, I wanted to see what had finally come in.  We had a group of five and the sitting area for the restaurant is pretty freaking tiny. They have a bar area for like 10 people and then about 4 or 5 tables. So we had to wait for a little bit for a table, but it also took forever for the servers to pay us any notice despite waiting inside for 10 minutes. And then after that, another 20-30 minutes for a table. The service here is pretty bad, not going to lie. We were able to order right away because we were waiting so long for a table, but then we ordered 5 waters and the waitress brought us 2 and then never gave us the others until we had to ask someone else. All the servers seemed super polite, but not very attentive.  The food was fine. It's nothing special, honestly. Our table had pretty much each ordered different types of ramen and it was just OK. I personally ordered the chicken katsu curry ramen and the chicken katsu was super good, but the ramen itself was just all right. However, the takoyaki and the gyoza were SUPER DELICIOUS. The takoyaki seemed fresh and was piping hot when it came to us and it was really flavorful and the presentation was nice too. But the food came out pretty fast once we were seated, so that was a plus.  Prices are pretty steep for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  I'd definitely come back here for the takoyaki and gyoza alone, but would probably skip on the ramen next time."}
{"text":"Food: delicious, good quantity   Price: very reasonably priced for the size  Service: reasonably quick, relatively friendly employees  Seating/atmosphere: limited seating, clean, can see the chefs from one side of the seating area"}
