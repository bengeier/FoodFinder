{"text":"If there was a limit on the amount of sashimi for AYCE and unlimited sashimi was only served during dinner, it wouldn't have gotten 3 stars hehe. The service is somewhat fair, even though I would have to ask for a bowl of rice more than once. If there was on option on the AYCE menu to check off \"steamed rice\" it would be nice.  I like the location, it's close to an intersection, and the subway. The quality of the food I receive at Ajimi is not too bad. The decor is not over-the-top, there's no music so it's pretty nice to not have any random distractions while I'm trying to eat, with the exception of other patrons chatter. So far this has been my to-go place for AYCE and I live another city. Please type \"steamed rice\" into your AYCE menu Ajimi Sushi!  Cheers."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not spectacular sushi, but it's definitely not the worst I've had either. One of the stars is just automatic because my office is in the same building so it's damn convenient.   I've had the all-you-can-eat for lunch a few times and I have to say, it's gotten somewhat better with each subsequent visit.... maybe they finally got into their groove. Most of the staff is the same as when it was Haru Zushi, with the exception of one of the sushi chefs... maybe he got the boot, not a bad move since the rolls are moderately better than before.  The lunch roll specials are a step up from its predecessor (Haru Zushi)... bigger, crunchier, tastier (L3 Crunch Roll combo is my go-to lunch special).   The food is decent, the decor is kinda kitschy (neon blue water bubble display... there are no words.) and the staff is pleasant enough. A solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"If it hadn't been for my last visit I would have written a glowing review. I've gone probably a dozen times before and have only encountered quick, friendly service and fresh food with a great AYCE menu.   The last time I went the avocado salad had wilted lettuce and brown avocado, it had obviously been sitting in the fridge for awhile, and the sushi rice was soft/soggy. The waitress kept pressuring us to place our second AYCE order (obviously in an order to move us out quickly, meanwhile the restaurant wasn't even busy) when we weren't even finished our first. She also kept forgetting some of the things we had ordered. It was all people I had never seen before working there so hopefully this isn't the direction it's taking."}
{"text":"This place is good! The lunch buffet is reasonable and has a lot of choices.  While the waitresses are usually pretty good (sometimes the wait for your food is a bit long) the sushi chefs run the place like the soup nazi from Seinfeld."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here last night. Our order was delivered promptly by a friendly and efficient gentleman and delivery is free on orders over $20, unlike a lot of other places who require a minimum of $30 for delivery. We ordered chicken fried rice, a green dragon and a unagi dragon roll and we both agreed they were the best we have ever had and the fried rice was loaded with chicken!!The flavor combinations and portions were perfect, we will definitely be regular orderers from here. I would have given them 5 stars but since we got take out we can't rate ambience, cleanliness or service. Would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. My wife and I dined there today and the overwhelming feeling when we left was why hadn't we gone sooner (we live 10 minutes walk away). Great quality food and low priced domestic breskis. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have been to Ajimi about a dozen times. Their food is quality and consistently so, and excellent when factoring in the price; they also currently offer a 10% discount for cash payment. The lunch/dinner AYCE price is consistent always (ie no jacking it up on the weekends.) Staff is cheerful and friendly, and there is free Wi-Fi now. Also like the location and ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"It's a nice alternative to my usual Japanese haunt - I Zu Japanese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Ajimi Sushi just recently opened at the corner of Yonge and Davisville, in the same spot where Haru Zushi used to me.  They have an a la carte menu, an all-you-can-eat lunch for $11.99, and an all-you-can-eat dinner for $18.99.  They are currently offering an additional 20% off those prices as part of their Grand Opening.  My friend and I went for the all-you-can-eat lunch.   Ajimi boasts a 138 item all-you-can-eat menu, but apparently this is only for dinner.  For the lower priced lunch you miss out on some items and dessert is not included.  The selection was still decent though as we sampled edamame, mango salad, avocado salad, miso soup, gyoza, teriyaki salmon, calamari, tofu, sushi pizza, a chicken skewer, and a variety of rolls.  The service was very fast, but it bothered me that the server did not take a second to tell us what she was putting in front of us as she brought it out.  When you order a wide-variety of items like this, especially maki rolls, it is not readily apparent what`s what.  The food was decent, some things better than others of course, but all in all a good deal for lunch.   Not spectacular, but good value for sure."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi place to go to when your other favourite places are closed. We stumbled onto this place because our favourite sushi place (Echo Sushi) was closed on Sunday lunchtime.   We order a spicy tuna roll and a green dragon roll as well as individual sushi pieces. At first the sushi was tasty because we were hungry but as we continued eating, we became full more quickly than usual. If you look closely at any sushi piece you can see that they packed the rice so tightly that the ratio of rice to sushi is too high! So every piece you eat, all you taste is the rice!  We also ordered some side dishes. Any cooked meats were dry and salty like the salmon teriyaki. Fried chicken had some weird dry batter on it, it didn't taste good. The green salad was good but they put a bit too much sauce on it, making it salty. The miso soup was also unbelievably salty.   Overall, okay for a sushi restaurant but not coming back here unless every other place around is closed. Price is cheap, $11.99 each for lunch but they pack their sushi rice and over salt every item on their menu. It's quite smart, trying to get you to drink more water and get full faster! Haha."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 star place. It's not going ot blow your mind, but the food quality is consistent and very reasonably priced.  I've been here a couple of times now because of my doctor's office being just down the street, and this is a great place to grab a quick bite that's not fast food. It actually reminds me quite a lot of Sushi Inn which is closer to Bloor-Yonge station.  The service is attentive and polite (but not overly friendly or personable) and is very effective at getting your food quickly. The food is fresh and always hits the spot. Between your sushi, salad and soup, you should be coming away feeling quite filled. They don't have the most flavourful rolls and sushi you'll ever have ( it has that bland rice that's typical of cheaper sushi), but for the price it's really fair.  Judging by the fact they have a discount for takeout and they're attached to an office building, I'm going to guess that a good portion of their business comes from the lunch rush and local delivery. And for that, it's perfect.  If you want cheap take out or delivery, this place will always keep you satisfied."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve 4 or let along 5 stars. 2 stars would probably be unfair, but 3 stars hits the spot. As you can imagine this place is nothing special and their prices reflect that. You get what you pay for. For a quick lunch break, I'd say you get good value for your money, but I would not go here to eat rolls or sashimi. They have friendly staff, which unfortunately does not make up for the mediocre quality of food they serve."}
