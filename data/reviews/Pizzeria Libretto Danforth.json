{"text":"The nduja sausage pizza was very good. The thin crust was not too crispy and not too soft.   Another favourite was the anchovie pizza but I wish there were more anchovies.   The calamari appetizer was great for sharing for 2-3 people."}
{"text":"The pizza here makes me want to sing my favorite parody 'shawty fire burnin' on the Danforth'.  Libretto is great, both locations.  Value, service, and consistency.  Better eats than 95% of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like authentic Italian pizza, I go to Pizza Libretto (I have boycotted Terroni's since they treat their customers like they are doing us a favour serving their food, ie., not giving olive oil and balsalmic vinegar for bread - right out refused!). Have visited both locations on Ossington as well as on the Danforth. My most recent visit was the Danforth location. Make reservations as this place gets busy. The place has a casual atmosphere which is kid-friendly. Ordered the arancino balls and beef carppacio - both were delicious. The complimentary bread with hot oil and balsamic dipping sauce was absolutely wonderful - I could have just eaten this and would have been quite happy :-) Ordered their specialty \"quattro\" pizza which had different toppings of mushrooms, olives, salumi, and artichokes to represent the 4 seasons. My husband had their neopolitan pizza composed of anchovies and olives. Their pizzas are thin and the crust is chewy - just the way I like it.  Their was some sort of mess up with our pizzas, so they apologized by giving us free desserts. All their desserts are made in house. I had the cinnamon coffee gelato which comes with 3 scoops and an almond biscotti. Will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Danforth location.  My BF and I had a lovely dinner at Pizza Libretto. Antipasto was fantastic, as was the pizza (obviously). The service was impeccable. When we had to wait a little long for a salad, they comped our dessert without us even asking!  ps. the Tiramisu is divine"}
{"text":"You know what I really LOVE? Being treated special. And that's exactly how I felt here. That, along with the exquisite pizza and complimentary Limoncello aperitif was delightful. Will be back often!"}
{"text":"The food is good but was a little confused why they were playing sports on big screen tvs at a trendy pizza restaurant - especially when St. Louis wings is across the street."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in Toronto. My family has agreed that outside of Italy, Libretto is the best we have ever had (and as a family of pizza-lovers, we have had pizza at many places). It is prepared in the traditional Napoletana-style, seen in the goodness that is the chewy, soft, blistery crusts. Service is friendly and fast as well. I've tried nearly every pizza on the menu (save sausage, anchovie, and salami) at one point or another, and they were consistent in their taste and quality. I am a bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I like a pizza with tomato sauce and melted cheese of some sort, rather than one grated on after the pizza has been cooked. The Nduja sausage and margherita are best for fans of that. The white mushroom pizza is delicious as well. Really, all the pizzas are good. There is something for everyone and the waiters are accomodating with omitting certain ingredients, if you prefer.   Not only are the pizzas great, but the appetizer menu is well rounded and perfectly proportioned. The warm olives are a great start to any meal. As for desserts, you can't make many mistakes here. My favourite is the Sfingi. If you like warm, pillowy donuts (and who doesn't?) these are amazing. They've got a beautiful golden crust and when i went were topped with cinnamon sugar and had a nutella filling (it might've been drizzle, I don't quite remember). Either way, they were incredible.  Pizzeria Libretto is one of my favourite restaurants in this city. The lunch prixe fixe ($15 for a three course meal) is a great deal and if you love pizza this is a must try."}
{"text":"I don't know, I almost feel bad for writing this as I expected to like this place.  A LOT.  I had been waiting forever to go and had heard people saying really good things and reading the positive reviews, but I didn't really like it.  I felt doubly bad because I had dragged one of my friends here with me and he didn't like it either.  I will admit that I'm not much of a pizza aficionado, but I found my pizza to be a bit too thin and kind of soggy.  I had the sausage pizza and there really wasn't much sausage on it.  I liked the chili oil but that was pretty much the only thing that gave the pizza any taste!  I found the decor okay (I liked the ovens for sure!) but again, no big deal.    Maybe it was an off day, but I went to pizza e pazzi a couple of weeks and to me, that was much better."}
{"text":"We were 2 people 'walk- in' Saturday night 8:30pm. While there were open tables - at least 15 seats open, we were told that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. I asked why we cannot sit in one of those & by the time the 'reso's' arrived the 45 minute tables would open up. Seems more than common sense to me (especially considering I own my own restaurant & have worked in nothing else for more than 20 years)  The hostess told us that is their 'reservation section' and this their 'walk-in section'... in my head I am wondering why one of the most important positions in the restaurant is occupied by an inexperienced pie/eyed dimwit; but instead I said \"obviously you don't own this restaurant' as we, and several others walked out the door. I will NEVER go back, nor will my dinner partner.  Clearly they don't need or want our business. Went down the street to 7 Numbers, were sat, given drinks and had our 1st dish I front of us in 5 minutes - also had a packed Saturday night crowd. Now THATS how you run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nov 25, 2013 - Dinner My 3 friends and I met at pizza libretto yesterday on the Danforth for 6pm.  We had phoned and made a reservation.  We all ordered our meals around 630, ate and was provided separate receipts as requested.  While the service was mediocre, it was really IRRITATING that we were asked to leave the table for another table of 8 people, while in the middle of a conversation.  It was about 7:50pm at this point.   Since we each dropped about 50$ each on our meals and Pizza Libretto  just earned circa $200 with a generous suggested 17% tip, each of us have decided we probably will not go back so that we won't be rushed out the door again.       Good pizza.  Not so good service."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere not to mention the food. Would  highly recommend if looking for authentic Italian pizza. Much love."}
{"text":"I didn't expect the pizza to be as good as it was. I was prepared for disappointment as I usually am when a restaurant has so much hype. We started with one pizza the Marguretia. It was perfect! We ended up ordering a second pizza. Our second pizza was the daily special, I don't remember the name. It had salami and maple cayenne drizzle. Both pizzas were better than I expect.   The staff didn't really have it together though. In their defence we were there at a bad time. We got there just before 4. They were getting ready for the dinner rush and our server either took a break or her shift was over. It took a long time to get our bill. Both pizzas came very quickly."}
{"text":"Danforth location: We came today to for Valentine's Day and had a poor experience with both food and service. We first ordered the calamari and flank steak. The calamari was seriously over cooked (way too crunchy and over cooked), the flank steak on the contrary was quite raw to the point it was inedible. Luckily the manager noticed this and offered to comp us for another app since the restaurant ran out of flank steak. Our drinks were forgotten twice and we actually just told our waiter to forget about the last round of beer even though he offered to comp that too (which was considerate). Over all I could feel like our waiter was growing increasingly impatient with us even though - we are not the type to typically send food back. We could tell as we would ask to add certain ingredients or slightly modify items and without checking with chef it was an immediate no where other locations would have certainly accommodated it. We were polite and courteous and didn't feel like there was the mutual partnership to help give us the food and service we were looking for.  I strong recommend whomever oversees the food being sent out takes the extra couple of seconds to better ensure quality and care. Our bill was $128 for pizza and apps + a few drinks and would expect more in the future if we were to ever return."}
{"text":"Another visit, this time for a special occasion. We were looking for something in the neighbourhood, with good, inexpensive food.  Walked in around 7:30p, and were seated by the window. The other options included by the bar and the communal table. This location does take reservations though.  We ordered: 1. Caprese salad - very milky, creamy and light fiore di latte paired with ripe Ontario heirloom tomatoes. A great start! 2. Libretto meatballs - three 1.5\" meatballs bathed in a chunky, spicy tomato sauce and a thin slice of grilled crostini. I enjoyed the meatballs very much and found the spicy kick to be just enough. Recommend. 3. House-made sausage pizza  with caramelized onion and chili oil - As my SO described it, Pizzeria Libretto somehow managed to make a thin crust that is chewy, dense and light all at the same time. Well done! It may look very thin, but don't let that fool you. This is a hearty dish. 4. I also ordered one of their cocktails with the peach puree, but forget the name. It was okay. Next time I'm getting my usual aranciada, which serves me well. SO ordered a red which was also just okay. I think it was the Sangiovese \"Capato\" 2010 DOC.  I was quite full and rolling out of the door at that point. I literally couldn't button my jacket up. No space for dessert! They didn't have the panna cotta on the menu, anyways. A summer dessert?? As long as it returns in some form...  Friendly, well-timed service. Solid dining experience. So happy that it's easily accessible and doesn't have the stupid line-ups that the Ossington location is known for."}
{"text":"Save your pizza money for this place because they serve delicious pizza.  We were a party of 7 and had no issues with making a reservation. Tried one of the daily specials, lemon fennel sausage pizza. It was great, the fennel sausage really shines. It should be added to the regular menu!  Also gave the duck confit pizza another shot; we had tried it at the Ossington location last time and wasn't impressed. The confit was plesantly moist this time around and was better on the Danforth.  The cremini mushroom pizza was creamy with an (un)healthy layer of cheese... Mmm. I would say it's my favourite of the four we had that night.  This location is great for groups."}
{"text":"....We let our server know that we were in a bit of a rush as we had a move to get to in about 1 1/2 hours.  Our server assured us that food would be out very promptly, and for the record, he really didn't lie (we were through three courses in less then an hour). Knowing how large those pizzas are, we opted to share one appetizer, two pizzas and a dessert. This is what we tried:  Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti (house-made crema fresca, lemon, chives, rosemary) This was tasty, but not as great as I was hoping. Being of the ricotta variety, the gnocchi themselves were a little heavy, which made the contrast with the crispy fried exterior a little less satisfying.  The herbs were a nice touch, but I found the crema pretty bland.  Actually, the entire dish was a bit spotty on the seasoning, with some bites being pretty salty, and some having little to no seasoning.  Nduja Sausage (tomato, garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella, stracciatella)  This was the better of the two pizzas, but both were delicious. First up, I love Libretto's crust, because it's chewy, slightly charred in some places, and has a gentle sweetness. I also loved the combination of salty, spicy sausage with sweet aromatic sauce, and a deliciously creamy mild cheese.  It may look large, but it's very easy to eat the whole pie.  I was also pleased that unlike a lot of thin crust pizzas in Toronto, PL's crust didn't get soggy or wet.  Duck Confit (bosc pear, mozzarella)    I loved the flavours going on here, but I just wished it had a bit more meat and pear, because 70% of the time, all I could taste was cheese on bread.  Regardless, the bites I did have with the rich savoury duck, and the sweet caramelized pear, were really solid.    Sfingi (Italian-style doughnuts) (lemon curd, caramel sauce & strawberry couli)  Now, I am a huge fan of pretty much any doughnut, but these were super delicious.  The sfingi had a wicked golden crust, but a soft and pillowy interior that seemed to almost melt once it hit my mouth.  I always feel somewhat confused when I see lemon and caramel paired up, but in this case, it totally worked where the bright citrus flavours could be balanced out by the rich caramel. I was also pretty grateful that the accompaniments were all plentiful, so that I didn't have to worry too much about rationing and running out by the time I reached the last Sfingi.  So for 2 cocktails, sparkling water, 1 app, 2 pizzas, 1 dessert and 2 (very very good) cappuccinos, the bill came to about $100 including tax and tip.  Pretty reasonable for dinner, and while it wasn't anything extravagant or innovative, the food was all very food.  I wish they would deliver, but then again, I think you lose a lot of the appeal of thin crust when you put it in a box for an hour and let it steam itself soggy.  I guess that just means I will have to be back to indulge my frequent pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed! Was very happy to see them open a second location as the Ossington spot would get so rammed. Lots of space and they take reservations, pretty much eliminating most of the annoyances of the old spot. Prefer it to the financial district location to be honest. Pizza is great, often with very creative specials, prices are right and the ambiance is nice and vibrant."}
{"text":"Was deciding what to eat on a late night after 10PM, and came across the popular Neopolean Pizza... Was hard to notice b/c they didn't have a usual sign up top, but had it written on the window...  Came in, and it was still a bit busy, and the atmosphere was very casual...Got started with 'Ontario Water' instead of sparkling.  Started with their beef carpacio, and it was nice and tasty...Had the lamb neck balls, and it was pretty unique as well.. Got the recommended pizza 'Njuja Pizza\" which has sausage, mozzerela, tomato, and other stuff i forgot...But my gf usually not into pizza, said this is definitely the 'BEST PIZZA' she's ever had...   Desserts: Had the cappuchino which had the milk shaped like a heart shape. Got the vanilla gelato...Can't go wrong with that...  Overall great place to eat once in a while...Definitely not a place to go if you are extremely hungry; otherwise, you will spend quite a lot..."}
{"text":"Great service and speed meets the best tasting Pizza I've found in Toronto. Their specialty pizzas are hit and miss (I didn't enjoy the duck), but their eggplant appetizer is delish!"}
{"text":"Favourite pizza place!! Been coming here for years and they continue to exceed my expectations! Excellent food & excellent service!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it is overrated. Went there a few times to give it a number of chances to live up to its reputation. The charcuterie board was good however pizza was average."}
{"text":"This place is always full and loud and fun. I went to the one in the West End a few times before and was happy when they opened this one in the area.  This isn't like thick slices, its Neopolitan style. so its super thin and sometimes even a little soggy in the middle. But so tasty! Yummy salad, and the staff is super friendly. If there's a wait for a table, you can sit at the bar.  Both times I've been here there were pretty loud families but i don't think thats a big deal."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, but not mind - blowingly so.  Although a bit on the salty side, the ingredients were fresh and the service was amazing.  I had the arugula and prosciutto pizza, and the eggplant pizza.  Definitely recommend the arugula and prosciutto pizza over the less than mediocre eggplant pizza."}
{"text":"Just a quickie here-- I was fortunate to get in on opening night. It was all hands on deck and that led to service being perhaps slightly over-attentive, however all the servers were super pleasant and helpful. Rocco was working the pass so all the dishes were coming out perfect.  It's like a parallel universe Libretto-- a bit of crossover from Ossington but not a carbon copy. Enough to make you want to be a regular at both. For starters we had the anchovy crostini, endive and beet salad (with a very cheeky radish masquerading as a grapefruit!), dungenees crab ravioli. For pizza we had the house-made sausage with fresh fresh basil, anchovy with chili oil and super fresh tomato sauce, and pork belly with ginger. The pizzas were good, but strangely a little bit chewier than Ossington. Beautiful char on the crust, and the flour has such a rich taste... It really is tough to mess up when using such high quality ingredients. But Rocco does much more than just \"good\"-- while you can come here and turn off your inner foodie and just down a few slices, you can easily dissect the nuances and flavour profiles of each dish.  Carl from Marben was right-- if anyone can nail an opening night, it's Rocco Agostino."}
{"text":"We recently had our office party at Pizza Libretto and it was a huge success!  We ordered a per person menu option and we had TONS of food arriving in waves for us during the entire evening.  The downstairs area by the bar was perfect for our group of 18 people, and the food and service were exceptional.  A bunch of us stayed for an \"after party\" and sampled the amazing desserts too - they're not to be missed.  Kelly set everything up for us, and she was a pleasure to work with.  The consensus among our group was that it was the best party we'd had, and there was definitely interest in returning next year.  I'd highly recommend Pizza Libretto for your next work party!  Thanks Pizza Libretto!"}
{"text":"This was such a disappointing dinner tonight.  We arrived about 7:15 and were seated downstairs with out friends.  Once we ordered two dinners came within about 10 minutes. The 3rd arrived about 10 minutes later and then mine came about 1/2 hour after the first ones came.  This is ridiculous service.  The downstairs wasn't busy when we ordered but then it filled up and almost everybody there was served before me.this is s busy place with a 90 second oven.  I complained and the Meg came down to apologize.  They comped the one meal in the group that came early but was cold.  My meal that was 30 minutes late wasn't acknowledged at all.  Sorry folks but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Libretto. Usually start with calamari and the pear walnut salad, both are delicious and we are always left wanting more it's so good. Our family orders a few pizza to share and none disappoint. Staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The best Pizza place in town. Soft and chewy bread, especially the one that was served to the table - rosemary focaccia. Excellent customer service - one who served us Kaylin was so friendly and made us feel very comfortable. When I mentioned to her that I liked the rosemary focaccia bread, she was kind enough to bring me a big chunk of it to take home. Was really touched by this gesture; would certainly go back to this place not just for the quality of food but also its excellent customer service."}
{"text":"First of all this is good pizza. The toppings are high quality and the combinations interesting, including some with their delicious home-made sausage. My only complaint is that the crust is a bit soggy, with slightly too much sauce. Not disgustingly so, just disappointingly so.   The wait staff was professional and friendly. Wine list interesting and well thought out. I would go back, as it is a great scene and the food is generally good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto hands down. Don't show up late without a reservation - my group never seems to mind sitting at the bar or front window though!   The food is amazing. Skip the salads and apps and go straight for the pizza. The \"special\" pizza is usually the best - can you say cayenne influenced maple syrup? I'm serious.. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. I went there on a weekday and got there before line-ups really began. The service was excellent and I was able to have a good chat with the bartender (I was sitting at the bar) who was very friendly. The atmosphere was great as it was casual but nice at the same time, great for families, social groups, couples and what not.  I ordered the spiducci, Ontario Prosciutto pizza, and tiramisu and affogato for dessert. The spiducci was probably my favourite dish. The pizza was as good as Italian-style pizzas can get. My only complaint would be their tiramisu, which was more like a creamy panna cotta with cake at the bottom. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer a more \"cake-ish\" version of the tiramisu...  Overall, I'd definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, lively and fun atmosphere, passionate and fun-loving staff. What more can one ask for?  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Met up with friends here on Saturday for an early dinner. Getting a reservation was a bit difficult, but it was definitely worth it.  Started off with Beef Carpaccio (good, but not outstanding), Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti (spectacular; crispy and pillowy at the same time, sauce was a fantastic match), Buttermilk Fried Calamari (incredibly crispy, and not all batter, and the accompanying red pepper almond sauce was quite nice), and Libretto Meatballs (can't speak to as I didn't try them, but the plate was clean when we were done)  For pizzas, ordered two of the Cremini Mushroom and a House-Made Sausage. Crust was thin, crispy, and flavourful. Pizza toppings were fresh & tasty.  Absolutely enjoyed everything, and wouldn't think twice about coming back the next time we make it into town!"}
{"text":"I've been here on many occasions. Twice with my toddler son and once for a girl's night out.   I was relieved that they were accommodating of my large baby stroller and didnt shun me for bringing a baby to their chic hip trendy resto.   Service was impeccable and no one was stuck up as you might expect places like that to be. They did not scoff at me for ordering water instead of a cocktail.   The food....the food is amazing. I had their set lunch with the margarita pizza and every bite just melts in your mouth. The sauce is fresh, the dough is thin and crispy where it should be, the ingredients were top notch. I also tried their meatballs. Very meaty and succulent though I've got nothing else to compare them to. The caprese salad was also delicious.   The mousse dessert in a jar is to die for. Creamy chocolaty and heavenly. The donut holes were also delicious.   Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob.  I won't eat it unless it's gourmet and super amazing.    For 2 years I heard that I must try Libretto, it's so good there's always line-ups.  So finally i did.  Disappointment!  I went with the waiters suggestion and got the duck and pear pizza.  The duck was dry and flavorless and I could barely taste the pear.  The only good part was the dough.. I'll admit that part was delicious.  Now if only the rest of it had been yummy I'd have been in pizza heaven.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about the opening of Pizzeria Libretto on The Danforth in recent weeks...perhaps a little too much hype.  I had dinner here last week with a few good friends, one of whom orders pies to go from the Ossington location and drives across town to pick them up!   The new Pizzeria Libretto location offers a cool space to dine or grab a beverage. The pizza is tasty. They use fresh ingredients...sauces...toppings...yadayada. That's what you get when you pay $15 for a thin-crust pizza cooked in an 800 degree oven for 90 seconds.  The staff -- mostly male -- were qualified, exuded that 'cool' vibe and knew what they were taking about.  The place was busy and I suspect will likely do very well on The Danny.  Yeh, I'd return again, maybe not on my own accord but certainly if a friend wanted to go there or if it was someone's b-day.  I still prefer Terroni."}
{"text":"The food is great. Make sure you make a reservation, even on week nights (in the summer anyway), as they are usually fully booked. Staff can be slightly rude and they charge extra ($1.50) for parmesan cheese (on top of a pizza with some freshly ground pepper seems pretty standard to me), but I would keep going back just for the pizza. Try to ignore the rude staff and enjoy the company you are eating with and everything will be great!"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm an expert on all these new pizza places, but my amateur palate is very impressed with Pizzeria Libretto.  The dough is very much like Indian naan - it's a bit stretchy and bubbled-up after the short stint in an extremely hot wood oven. Toppings are varied and well-paired and the specials are always interesting. Last time I had lamb bacon (slow-cooked and then stripped) and it was incredible. My wife can't get away from the white anchovy - highly recommended if you like a salty pizza.  The only take reservations for about 40% of the restaurant so it's always worth trying a walk-up and hoping for a table.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Special pizza - fennel sausage and scamorza cheese.  Pizzas were good. Salads average. Calamari were over cooked and hard.  Service friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered Margherita DOP. It was really delicious. The place was clean with good decoration. Nice service, but too nice for me"}
{"text":"So, my sister love's this place and keeps speaking about it. SO one saturday evening she took me here. It was super crowded and busy and there was a wait list for seating. They took down my name and number and would call when a table became available. When we got our call and got our seat, the server has nice she greeted us in a friendly and warm manner and when she found out that it was my first time explained the concept of this particular pizza experience. She was super helpful and gave here recommnedations. I settled on trying the Libretto Meatballs (spicy bomba tomato sauce, grilled crostino, grana padano which was good, I enjoyed this and as for the pizza I settled upon the Grilled Eggplant (tomato, basil, chili flakes, ricotta salata on spelt flour. Wer waited for our food to arrive I was told that my particular pie had to be redone due to not coming out right the first time. So, when I got my pie I tried a few slices and I wasn't impressed, it was incredibly salty and I did not enjoy the pie at all, the spicyness was incredibly blatant and overwhlemeing and the saltiness just killed the pizza I was disappointed. Hopefully, when I return I can try another pie and hopefully be satisfied with the rave reviews I have heard in regards to the pies."}
{"text":"We went to vacay in Italy last year and had what real pizza should taste like! although i am a big fan on pizza pizza, dominos and panango - yes, guilty pleasure - dont judge. Real Italian pizza is unbeatable - i mean, they use fresh ingredients out there - crazy idea! we had margheritta pizaa every street corner we could and we simply fell in love with the simplicty of the flavours. You dont HAVE to have 3 toppings and extra cheese everytime!!  We vowed we dont have low class north American pizza again now that we know better - didn't last very long as we picked up a slice each on our way home!   However, Pizza Libretto keeps it authentic! The pizza and ingredients were as fresh, simple and flavourful as we remember! it was perfect! We had the Margheritta and were not disapointed.  For appetizers: - potato Gnocchi - it was good! soft and flavourful - melts in your mouth with cheesy perfection!   - Arugula salad with generous heaps of walnuts and simple and delicious vinaigrette. I'm picking up Arugula from longos on my way home tonight  -i'm a convert!   The restaurant itself is nice and so conveniently located right on the Pape subway station. I havent been to the other location so can't really compare the two. We didn't have reservations - as i turn 30 this year i'm trying the while keepin it spontaneous thing but to my dismay realizing that tables are full on a Saturday night in the city - we did luck out with seats at the bar downstairs. It would've been nice to be upstairs where the action was but nonetheless we received really great service donwstairs.  There weren't as many meat options for the pizzas here, perhaps they have different menus for the two locations? My friend and i compared notes and we think that's the case. Ossington - next on the agenda!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 5 of us made a reservation for a dinner the other night. Place is a nice soze not too small. Service is great we were taken care of within minutes. Group of 5 so we ordered 3 pizzas and some appetizers which all came so fast but were all fresh and hot! Good place to go to share food with friends! We were in and out within an hour (thats how fast all our food came)! Pizzas are very light, good so that you can eat a lot and not be too stuffed. Meatballs were soft and delicious. Calamari was my favourite, cooked perfectly not overdone! Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch and ordered the supposedly famous pizza. It was the lunch special for $15 wtih salad. The pizza arrived and it was slighly burnt on the bottom. not so tasty..but we were in a hurry..Ordered two glasses of red valapolicella wine nothing fancy and it came in small glass quarter full. The cost $22.00 for the wine Ouch! our bill was $100.00!! Too much for pizza and lunch Good luck  Don't think at those prices with the great greek food around you will last"}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for lunch and it was Really GREAT!  They have a prix fix menu for about $15.  You can get a seat right away (we went around 2 pm)  If you want to try them for the first time, I definitely recommend going at lunch as dinner gets crazy (But still worth the wait) ;)"}
{"text":"Better than most of the pizza I had in Italy.  Whoa, did I just say that?  Yes, I did.  They have a crazy oven that they brought in from Italy that comes with all sorts of certification verifying it's authenticity. It's wood-burning, and gets hella hot. So hot, that each pizza takes less than 90 seconds to cook.  The crust is chewy with a bit of spring, and is perfectly blistered, lending a smoky flavour to the final product. I would dare to say that is eerily similar to the flavour and texture of Naan. Which, truth be told, is not a bad thing at all.  I've tried most of the pizzas on their menu. I adore the White Anchovy pizza. Don't get turned off until you've tried it. The combination of salty Anchovies, Roasted Garlic, Pickled Chilis, and Creamy Bufala Mozzarella is heavenly. I also dig the Prosciutto and Arugula, and Caramelized Onions and Sausage Pizza. Both are really, really good.   You really can't go wrong with any of their Apps. The Fried Gnocchi, Buttermilk Calamari, and Arancini are all solid choices.  If you still happen to have room for dessert, the Budino is out of this world. It's a Chocolate Hazelnut Pudding that will put your tastebuds on cloud nine. Looking for something a bit lighter? The Lemon Posset is also a great choice.  Regardless of which pizza you choose, make sure to douse those bad boys in their house Chili Oil!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Just as amazed and delighted as the first time. Food is great and service was quick. Coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"Had a wait even on a Tuesday night- but I guess that's a good sign!  I ordered the white pizza with pear & duck confit- really tasty!  My friend had the special which was a kale pizza which surprised me the most- I usually don't like lots of green on my pizza but they had mixed in herbs with the kale and lovely strong cheese- tasted amazing!  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went a couple days ago. AMAZING.  First off, NATHAN was delightfully friendly and helpful. My favorite dude ever.  Second, when my girlfriend remembered to tell them about her tree nut allergy, without missing a beat he gladly had a another arugala and pear salad made for her. Thank you so much!!  Third, when I was having pizza decision challenges Nathan not only suggested the Cacciatore pizza but let me sample a piece of the salami (which was heavenly).  I had 2 americanos and a dynamic duo of chocolate & vanilla gelato (nearly died and went to flavor heaven).  Love the food, love the decor, love the incredible service. I might plan my next birthday there!!  You've got to go."}
{"text":"Pizza quality is great I like the different combinations ... Really get the stone oven taste you should expect . Only complaint I have is that it's overpriced"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite pizza places in Toronto. Little on the pricey side, but totally worth it.   Visited this location a couple of times on Friday nights and every time I'm there I get amazing service. It's always busy but the staff will do their best to seat you as fast as possible. I personally love the atmosphere/ vibe of this place.   I ordered their original Margherita pizza and asked for mushrooms to be added to it. They were very accommodating of that. The service was fast even though the place was packed.   Highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to experience pizza that's not considered \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in the city. Wood fire baked to perfection in traditional Napolitani style. Appetizers and deserts are great too but the pizza, as it should be, is the true star. If only I could get this quality in delivery."}
{"text":"Way better than Queen Margerita! This is my addiction when I'm craving the best quality pizza available. The key is simple recipe but super fresh, high-quality ingredients: I like them all, but  the basic marinara and margherita are my favourite for the vibrant flavours. Pizza is the main attraction but the apps are really good, the rocket salad is one of the better ones out there, and the calamari was not heavy/oily even when I ordered it to go. Oh, and the deserts are also yummy with a bit of twist from the regular italian desserts you'd expect."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place, with the pizza being made in a wood fired oven.  The toppings are simple with great quality giving an awesome taste.  The only drawback is the price - it is slightly pricey, but very yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and cool environment. We ordered 4 different pizzas and the crusts were slightly burnt. (Prosciutto with arugula, eggplant, margharita, and funghi with sausage). Otherwise it was really tasty. Dip the crust in the chili oil that is provided! Super good!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times. The best Margharita pizza by far. My two year old loves to watch them flip the dough in the kitchen and see them cook in the wood fired oven.  They always say hi to him and give him a sticker which makes him feel special and he talks about the restaurant all the time.  The duck and pear is also another favorite of ours, all on spelt crust which is a great option.  This has now become our regular weekend place to stop for dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend organized a surprise party here for my birthday back in September, we got the appetizer platter for every table - consisting of cured meats, cheeses, bread, olives etc, it was a fabulous start to the meal. We basically ordered every pizza on the menu, since I'm allergic to tomatoes I only sampled the white pizzas - the duck confit, the mushroom and the sausage with chili oil, all were spectacular. Fresh, vibrant tasting. Dessert, we ordered most of them for the guests to share, panna cotta which I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who liked it, mini donuts - who doesn't love them, tiramisu - so creamy and delicious and some gelato. The evening was great, service was spectacular. We were so excited we decided to go back several months later for another try. We went with my mom, boyfriend and sister, we ordered apps, the ricotta gnocchi fritti which were so delicious little balls of basiclly fired cheese how can you go wrong. I ordered the braised beef shank which was actually so disgusting, it was almost all fat, the polenta it was served on was cold and bland. When our pizzas cme they were soggy and almost runny, my sisters margarita pizza had a tomato soup effect going on in the middle. My pizza - the duck that I loved the first time I tried, was also very moist and was just ehhhhh. Sad to say but I've had better from pizza pizza. My mom and boyfriend spilt the sausage, they however had no complaints. The reason I'm giving this place a 3 is because of my first experience, the food was so good as was the service but I can't say ill be going back for dinner anytime soon. Oh and as a p.s. they offer you regular or sparking water when you come in, but what they don't tell you is that if you opt for sparkling it will cost you $3 a bottle. Rip off."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try their food here and it's good.  I went here during lunch and their $15 deal (comes with salad, pizza and dessert). I think it's a great deal bc the pizza is already  $15-$17 alone.  I've tried their famous calamari, it was great and margarita pizza was simple and tasty. The only thing im not aware when I came here, it's NOT wheelchair or stroller friendly (in my case). Luckily some of the people are nice enough to help me. But the staff and service is friendly and nice."}
{"text":"We come to Greek town to look for Greek food but end up in this pizza restaurant.  You can have either cheese or not on your pizza.  I have more and more pizza friends who like to have pizza but no cheese, thanks!    In a Greek town but it is packed.  Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula pizza is very good.  Amazingly it has a lot of Prosciutto.  You have some taken out and just eat it alone.  The House-made Sausage is one of a kind.  The pizza is of a large size.  Quite a few table has to pack the remains.    We try the Libretto Tiramisu.   It is highly rated with the origin taste of how a Tiramisu tastes like.  For a good Tiramisu,  it is hard to make.  I know that it has a new location in downtown.  Hmm no need to drive all along and will see if it is as good as the one on Danforth"}
{"text":"I've been to Pizza Libretto on the Danforth twice in one month - opening nite and last nite. They haven't gotten it right yet.   The calamari is delightful -- though they're a little skimpy with the aoli and black garlic dips. The fig/pear salad is a wonder. Pizza toppings are delicious (the funghi blows my mind). Unfortunately, the crust is undercooked (I know that Neopolitan pizza is \"different,\" but I've some amazing ones in NYC and I find that Libretto has not done it properly on the four pizzas I've tasted). It seems like they rush the job and don't ensure the pizza is up to standard.   I can overlook that, but last night I ordered the \"pork belly\" pizza and got a pie with slices of raw pork on top. I sent it back, it was taken off the bill, but there was no apology from the manager. In fact, the waiter said he was looking for the manager all night in hopes the guy would \"do something\" for us, and \"he's around here somewhere...\" How embarrassing. Your establishment sends.something to the table that could make a person seriously ill and your staff can't find you?? Shameful.   I'd like this place to stop trying to be so trendy and inject a little quality food control into the mix. It was interesting to compare last night's experience to opening night, when no less than 12 servers and one manager came by our table to tend to every need (excessive, but we appreciated their enthusiasm). Where was the manager last night?"}
{"text":"Despite what I've read in some previous reviews, I found our pizzas arrived super quick, even though the place was close to full. I ordered the cremini mushroom pizza which was fantastic - loved the fresh rosemary sprinkled on top! I ended up taking half of it home as I couldn't finish the whole thing. I finished it later that night, cold, and it was still delicious (who doesn't love cold pizza, amiright??). Looking forward to stopping by again in the future!"}
{"text":"My cousin took us here on a Thursday night. The place was semi packed with a bar and sitting area that oozed a trendy and hipster vibe.   We ordered... -Caprese salad: I am a sucker for anything with fresh basil so this was a great start. Mozzarella was also nice and creamy. Simple yet tasty. -Calamari: Crispy but a tad heavy on the batter for me. Romesco sauce was okay. -Daily special: white pizza with speck, figs, mozzarella, a drizzle of honey topped off with arugula and walnuts. This was definitely our table fav! Balance of the sweet and salty was so unique and delish! -Mushroom pizza: too much rosemary for my liking -Duck confit pizza: pear slices was a nice and sweet touch -Nduja sausage pizza: spicy and salty  The pizza dough was really good. However all the centres of our pizzas were soft making it a challenge to keep all the toppings in place if we were to use our hands.  Overall good experience and unique pizza combinations. Props for the complimentary housemade foccacia, sourdough and balsamic, olive and chilli oil dip."}
{"text":"Good, certainly, but we think Falasca (three blocks south of Yonge/Eglinton) offers even better pizzas and pastas, plus warmer and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Did not want to sit one person at a table for two. There were plenty. People are dum."}
{"text":"Great service. Soggy pizza. Wet pizza, in fact. Gross. I sent it back and ordered a different pizza and it was soggy too. I think the problem is putting the pizza on the plate straight out of the oven- they need some sort of  specialty pizza serving plate (with holes) so that the moisture can escape-most pizza places don't serve you pizza on a plate straight out of the oven (and most don't serve you wet pizza- maybe there's a correlation?) Big problem for a restaurant that sells itself on their pizza, imho. Pluses: great space. Friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"I went to dine here with my kids and we got seating downstaris because it was busy and noisey. The appetizer we ordered was kalamari in some sort of red pepper sauce which was very delicious and the pizza was also really good. The only negative thing was that the waitress came around at the end of our meal to take our plates and started to clear the table without asking if we were done eating. I was still chewing on my last slice and had some crust in my plate that i was definately going to finish. I had to tell her that I am not done yet. Other then this the experience was good. Also they could add more items on their dessert list. I did have the Tiramasu which was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the chance to visit this spot last week with my GF. I cannot wait to visit this place again!  We went in the evening and it was busy! They told us a 20 minute wait or we could sit at the bar. We reluctantly took the bar but we were glad we did. The Barkeep served us. He was super friendly and gave great recommendations.  We ordered 2 pizzas. We ordered the Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula and the Nduja Sausage. very pleased with both. The prosciutto and arugula was especially good. I was skeptical due to the lack of cheese but i think I found a new favorite pizza. The sausage pizza was great too but quite heavy. The fact that it was stone baked made it what it was.  Total time spent was about 1.5 hours. It happened to be close to a music hall so we hopped over there afterwards. My GF hasn't stopped bugging me about going back to Pizzeria Libretto!  Service - 4.5/5 Food - 5/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Value - 5/5  Overall 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The lunch special is a fantastic deal. For $15 you get a really nice beet and cheese salad, followed by a margarita pizza, followed by gelato. For an extra $5 you can pick any pizza on the menu. I had the duck confit pizza and my girlfriend had the nbudja sausage pizza. We split it, so we got half of each. The pizzas were great. The toppings were fresh and delicious, and the crust was among the most delicious I've had. One note that could be improved on is the middle of the pizza which was thin enough that we found it difficult to eat the slices by hand, and had to use a fork and knife. I've already mentioned that the beet salad was nice but to elaborate the salty cheese and the sweet beets, topped with olive oil, really gave my tastebuds a bit of a high. The gelato was a string way to finish, sweet and smooth."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here.  I have tried about half of the pizzas on the menu and so far the cacciatore salami is my favourite followed closely by the homemade sausage with sautéed onions or the Ontario prosciutto.  I liked the duck confit, very tasty but I like tomato on my pizza.  I've also tried the meatballs and calamari, very good portions, fresh and tasty.    I have always enjoyed good service from the staff at Librettos and overall it's a nice casual experience.  Good value as pizzas are between $12 to $17 (ish).  I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This use to be my favourite pizza place when they had one location in the west end. Food has really gone downhill and the service has always been lacklustre.  Had 3 starters - Piatto Grande, calamari and eggplant parm. Above average except calamari was too greasy. Two pizzas - Libretto Margherita and Prosciutto & Arugula. Crust tasted like cardboard and buffalo mozzarella was way too soggy."}
{"text":"This is a great option if you don't want to wait 30+ minutes at the Ossington location. The Neapolitan style pizza is deliciously unique, and I would recommend the duck confit pizza (white) or Ontario prosciutto and arugula pizza (red). They also have some great appetizers (the arancini, buttermilk calamari and Libretto meatballs are personal favorites), and the Gragnano is a very refreshing sparkling red wine. My main complaint is the seating get get a little cramped, and the service can be hit or miss depending on which server you get. But overall a very good option if you're in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"On the weekends, during dinner, be prepared to stay for at least an hour and a half. Pizza takes around 45-60 mins to be ready so I highly recommend ordering an appetizer. The calamari was great, honestly the best calamari I've ever had. The batter was good and it was fried perfectly. I also highly recommend reserving a spot on the weekends for dinner. Wait times for a spot at the bar for two people average 25 mins, I assume for a table, the wait will be longer."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their Pizza is just amazing. Waiters are very friendly too."}
{"text":"Service is good, friendly waiters. The meatball appetizers are too die for. You can taste all ingredients, the cheese,oregano mmm We had the nduja sausage pizza and boy are they spicy. Good pizza overall will try to come for the lunch special. More bang for your buck"}
{"text":"O my god so good the pizza is cooked perfectly and so thin with the cheese it is so good the sauce is perfect their is no chunks of tomato in the sauce it is prefect so dddddilish"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday on a Thursday and got a seat outside. I had the stellucha riesling wine (best white wine ever), kale salad (kale was rough, not massaged with the vinaigrette), calamari (YUM), pizza with the arugula and prosciutto (10/10), meatballs (pretty good), and tiramisu (excellent). Majority of the food excluding the kale salad was delicious. Service was on point. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The rice balls were pricey but really tasty. I was expecting the pizza to be just as good, but the burnt crust left me disappointed."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is busy!  Great atmosphere and excellent staff. I ordered the  Diavola pizza arrived hot to our table but not baked through evenly. We send it back, no questions asked and a new pizza came it its place and was perfect.  The arugula salad with walnuts and shaved parm was fab.  Fun night out, great food, and terrific service."}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza. Relaxed ambiance. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My uncle and I were feelin' some delicious pizza, and delicious pizza we received. I've been to both locations multiple times and the food is consistently amazing. We ordered: -The pizza with arugula and prosciutto (i'm too lazy to google the menu for the name of it) -arugula salad -calamari -400 plates of bread and oil.. figuratively speaking   all perfect and wonderful! I highly recommend the salad. Get whatever pizza you like, but the salad, you NEED to get the arugula salad. It's life changing.    Ok that's enough about the food.....   The service was SO fantastic! Our hostess/server, Margret was super friendly and hilarious. My uncle has a very silly sense of humour so it was nice to not get any pretentious \"we never laugh or show we are slightly human\" attitude. I want to only go there when she is working. Is it creepy as hell if I call the restaurant and ask if she's working? Probably.   My uncle kept making a joke about the pH of the water and one of the bartenders came out with pH strips and we tested it at the table...  I thought it was funny, and a nice touch.  Also the bus boy who brought our bread was friendly and a babe.   If you want amazing service, good looking staff (everyone, not just the bread boy) and great food, please go here. The danforth ain't all about the Greek food (and I'm a Greek lady who eats olives and feta cheese 365 days a year)"}
{"text":"Favorite Neapolitain pizza place in Toronto, very consistent. Only eaten this location so far.  Well-made with good texture and the right amount of toppings, not drowning and not half-naked. My dear friend says the Ossington location cheats with thin toppings, which is tough if that's your dinner budget.  Ambiance at Libretto Danforth is somewhat cavernous, sterile and echoey. You will not relax easily here in a sweet Mediterranean reverie. But I stop by there to eat and leave.  There's a nice event room in the lower level which appears to offer a more intimate space."}
{"text":"Glad to see the Pizzeria Libretto brand expanding to different parts of the city. I have to say the service and food are VERY similar to their original flagship location on Ossington.  Our food arrived on time and was very delicious.  I had leftovers and they even packed it up for me.  I will definitely come again if I am in the Danforth area and craving pizza!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my list of places to try for almost a year.  This is what I have to say about it.  This place is sooo over-rated.  Granted they have nice decor and good service.  However, I am all about the food.  I had the pizza Margarita.  Nothing special.   Mine was burnt.  And you can see that the crust was burnt, but they didn't seem to care to serve it to me anyway. Not only was my pizza burnt, the recipe was not even good in the first place.  Not good pizza.  And not worth the price."}
{"text":"There are many things to like about this restaurant. My wife and I shared two salads and one small pizza, plus desert, plus a digestive. One salad was a version of caprese, but with beets instead of tomatoes for the red of the red white and green. It was crispy thanks to the beet, which added nicely to the texture.    The other was Rocco's salad, a house creation, which has a whack of ingredients -- fennel, radish, egg, asparagus, endive, prosciutto ham, hazelnuts and mustard dressing.  It made me think that people should stop referring to Italian food as simple. It is very complex and subtle, and prepared with great care and artistry. Such taste can't be mass-produced or made on an assembly line. My standard of comparison for this meal is the Turin area of Italy, which I visited just a few weeks ago. It is a major \"center of origin\" in terms of Italian foods, but it is a northern city, so pizza is not all that common, as it is in Toronto, where the majority of the Italian community comes from the south. But Turin, like this restaurant, serves food that is very complex in the numbers of ingredients, and the care with which they are prepared to have tastes bounce off each other. Turin, after all, is a major centre of Slow Food. The service was terrific -- friendly, conversational and fun, as well as knowledgeable and efficient. Maybe he was just acting, but then, that's what he's trying to do while he waits table. He will do well!"}
{"text":"Service was sup bar, waited 15 to order.  Ordered calamari and duck confit pizza.   The calamari was actually amazing, some of the best that I've had in a while. The only problem I had was it was to oily. And a personal thing I don't like breaded calamari. But it was good.  The pizza came a lot later than expected. The duck confit was overly salty, the bosc bears too thick, the rosemary, you couldn't have cut it or seperated it from the stem?? Mozzarella was good. Over all the ingredients were good but the construction of the pizza needs work. Barf.   A sub par meal and experience I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time tonight and I have to say it was great. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio to start which was very good. I recommend you add the oil they provide you to it as it adds some extra flavour. We then shared the Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula Pizza, which was amazing. This pizza is definitely all it is cracked up to be. Make sure you reserve your table if you are going on the weekend."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza spot in Toronto. Authentic Neapolitan pizza, great atmosphere, good appetizers. In a good area of the city, and you get your pizza made in 2 min from a very high temperature oven just like they have in Napoli. I've never been disappointed here. Get the traditional margherita pizza."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars  Back again today with friend and Dh.  What does this place tell you about the Danforth?  We need something other than coffee shops and greek food!  PL has a constant stream of clientele from our start time of 12:30 - about 2pm.  The order:  Braised Oxtail with creamy polenta & brussells 10 + just like first visit $14 Buttermilk Calamari with rosy sauce. 6/10...doesn't need sauce just some slice lemon would be great. wish they gave the option of grilled wouldn't get this again $12 Pear and Fig salad w/gorganzola and mustard vinegrette.  6/10  it's ok needed more dressing a bit bland which is not saying much considering the blue cheese factor $10 Dungeness crab ravioli in cream sauce 5/10.. too much sauce, undercooked pasta, unsalted not a lot of flavour $12, the chanterrele mushrooms were hard to find  3x pizza pork belly $15 house made sausage $16 prosciuotto & arugula  $16   alll excellent 9/10  needed a punch of pepper and salt  2x amaro cocktail 3x steam whistle  $190 + $30 tip     will go back but stick with pizza only and the oxtail appetizer.  however many antipasta platters were going out may have to try that"}
{"text":"Yum. That could suffice.  Maybe five stars is too much.  But four just doesn't seem fair.    The Good: - sitting in the front window offers the best view ( of people walking by ) - the bread and the chili infused oil and tangy bright balsamic was a refreshing and intriguing warm up.   Truly, I would return just for this.   - beet salad was off the hook...light, crisp, cold, sweet, savoury, simple.   Delicious. - arancini was complex, unique, perhaps-better-in-January, yet just right. - the sausage pizza was a simple blend of sweet and savoury with the best thin crust I've ever enjoyed. - service was attentive and professional, if a bit cold   The Bad: - the hostess always seems too stiff...\" Do you have a reservation?\" When the place is near empty just comes off scripted and unwelcoming.  - sitting in the back is too noisy and the chairs are uncomfy...hence this trip we opted for the window seats.   - the Americano coffee was thin and underwhelming....especially after being forewarned that \"all our coffees are espresso based\" by our server.  Seemed like a kuerig pour.   - not enough carne on the menu...same for a solid pasta.   Menu is fantastic...but predominated by lighter fare.    - the servers are all good...professional...attentive....but there just seems to be something missing.  A bit cool?      These are minor things...the food impresses.  The packaging is pleasing.   It's a great spot well worth a lunch stop or light dinner out."}
{"text":"While on a quest for good Italian food in the Danforth/Beaches area on a Sunday afternoon (~1:30pm), we ended up at Pizzeria Libretto because all other Italian restaurants in the area were closed. This ended up being a blessing in disguise...  THE GOOD: - So many options to choose from! We opted for a basic margherita pizza and the special of the day: spicy pepperoni. They also have pizzas with sausage, prosciutto, and a number of \"white pizzas\" without tomato sauce that sounded delicious. It's a great place to bring a group - there's something for everyone.  - When our first of two pizzas arrived, a young gentleman (may have been the owner) informed us that the other pizza would be another five minutes because it \"wasn't up to their standards\". I actually see this as a positive - it's good to see that they hold their pies to a certain standard of quality. Sure enough, our second pizza came in less than 5 minutes (and was absolutely delicious).  - For extra mozzarella on your pizza (who can say no to that?), ask for it to be \"doppio\" - an extra $3. We went \"doppio\" for both our margherita and spicy pepperoni pizzas, and every morsel of extra cheese was worth it.  - These pizzas have a thin, airy crust that really let the toppings take centre stage. I highly recommend using a fork and knife, or if you're feeling brave, try folding a slice in half - all of the ingredients cave in on each other and it's double the tomatoey, cheesy and meaty goodness.   THE BAD: - I've got no downsides to mention here - we had a 5-star experience and I would definitely return.   P.S. If you visit, be sure to scope out the large pizza ovens in the back - that's where all the magic happens!"}
{"text":"Love the decor, staff and FOOD. The pizza is consistently fantastic and their tiramisu is a MUST. I've tried both of their locations and I've been impressed."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, terrible service, no wi- fi for patrons.  I used to go here many times times last year.  Went in yesterday, was seated, given a beer, then waited forty minutes while I was virtually ignored by the staff, even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  After finally ordering my meal, my waiter told me he was finished his shift and his colleague would be taking over.  Another wait.  Then my new waiter appears and ten minutes later so does my old one.  I guess his shift had come to an end!?  Horrendous, inattentive service.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! This is simply the best pizza I have had in a while. We dropped by on Sunday for a quick dinner and although the restaurant was busy, we were seated right away and our server ran through all of the daily specials with us.  The decor is modern and contemporary, without being over the top. The space is bright and airy, with a large dining area on the main floor, a smaller lounge/dining room downstairs and a decent-sized patio out front.  We settled on a margherita pizza and a nduja sausage pizza. They both arrived within five minutes and were absolutely divine! A little crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside and with just the right amount of toppings. I was blown away by the nduja sausage which had exactly the right amount of spice. We dipped our pizzas in their signature chili oil, and while it was good, I could really taste that much chili and it really tasted like regular olive oil to me.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other pizzas on the menu!"}
{"text":"So happy they opened a second location on the Danforth. Great vibe. The lunch special in particular, is a great value. Pizza, a large salad and a dessert for $16."}
{"text":"Pizza is still decent and the lunch prix fixe is a great deal, but the pizza came undercooked, and the server had the audacity to say that's how it should be. The chocolate gelato was horrible. Grainy from improperly dissolved cocoa. No real chocolate. Server kept referring to us as \"friend.\" His style was of ersatz friendliness and was cloying. I'll stick to Terroni."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza place I found in Toronto. Although I'm not a huge pizza fan, I like them here. Last time I was here, I had 3 vegetarians with me so I was outnumbered and outgunned. We ended up ordering 3 different Vege pizzas (Libretto Margherita, Marinara DOP and Cremini Mushroom) and sharing them. I wanted to try their Duck Confit pizza, maybe next time.  I love their Danforth Location the most."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. I ordered Meatball, Beef carpaccio, Calamari, caprese salad, Duck confit pizza. All dishes are so nice! Must try Beef carpaccio! That was awesome balance of taste. Calamari also enjoyable with sauce. Duck confit and pear is beautiful balance on pizza. Server is so friendly. Definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this place and decided to try it one day as we were in the area. We were very disappointed as when we looked at the menu they didn't have any meat piazzas.... They only had sausage and duck... I am not sure about duck on my pizza.. Or duck in general.. Therefore, we had to go to a different place for dinner.."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a bunch of friends. Great appetizers, great pizza and atmosphere is top notch! Highly recommend!  Brought out dessert for our friend as she was the birthday girl! :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, thin crust, fresh ingredients, interesting and inspired combinations. Cooked in wood burning stoves in...90 seconds flat. (Wowza!)  The decor was interesting. Very industrial, bare bones, and set up a little like a cafeteria without the need to share tables.   Our server, was atrocious, easily two star. We showed up at 7, finished our meal around 8 and clearly were his last table because not only did he clear my plate while my husband was still clearly eating but he also insisted on wiping the table...in front of both me and my husband, to the point where he had to lift his plate for the server, mid meal. Based on service alone, we'd think twice about returning but the pizza was good.   Unfortunately for this restaurant they've parked themselves in a sea of great restaurants (The Danforth) and if we were in the area again we probably wouldn't return, the pizza was good, but not good enough to make up for service that bad."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food is delicious. I love the calamari. The sauce that comes with this dish is amazing. Love the service and the atmosphere. There are a few locations in Toronto and they are all great."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for my birthday in April and it was quite enjoyable.  I got the Doppio pizza and he got the classic Margherita and we both enjoyed it.  I don't generally like really thin crust pizza, but this one was nice and not overly crispy.  Lots of cheese (which is why I got the doppio) and the sauce was very tastly.  The only thing I would change is to add more basil than was on it.  We got the warm marinated olives appetizer and they were very tasty.  For desert, I got the Chocolate-Amaretto Budino which was delicious and he got the Chocolate Affogato which he liked.    Overall, it was a nice place with great food.  My biggest complaint was the tight quarters to squeeze in as many tables as possible and the acoustics.  The room is open and industrial and the noise level from everyone talking was really bad.  I couldn't really hear my husband across the table unless I really concentrated and he was talking straight at me."}
{"text":"Meh, this place was very underwhelming. Heard about Pizza Libretto for years. Was excited one opened up on the Danforth. Went on a Friday night, got in right away which was really nice and scored a wickedly geat seat in the window, facing the street. I will give the seating a 4 out 5 as it is a perfect people watching seat. Ordered calamari stafold followed by pizza. The calamari was cooked well but the sauces they served with them did not compliment the calamari at all. In fact, I found they made the squid taste bad. I could not figure out why they served those sauces with the calamari as they made the dish taste really bad. Simple lemon is always best with calamari or even a litely spiced sauce. The pizza arrived. I knew that the crust was going to be very thin. I was prepared. I guess it is not my thing. Thin crust pizza. I didn't care for it. It tasted fine, the buffalo mozzarella was soft, fresh and tasty. It was all around good but the thin crust was such a turn off for me. The price for a pizza is quite steep, $15 and to me, just not worth it. Would I go again? Probably not as you will find me at the Danforth Pizza House, with Angelo, diving into some delist old school pizza!"}
{"text":"First time at Libretto. We ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti, Arancini, Grilled Calamari. The Grilled Calamari was the best. I would skip the other two first courses. For pizza, we had the Libretto Margherita and Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula. Both were good but I don't think i wouldn't order them again. Terroni's pizza is still my favourite.  Overall I would rate  the food 3.5."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we've found, as newcomers, in quite a large area. What I like in addition to the good pizza are the changing specials, the set menu, and the relaxed atmosphere, that somehow gets the mix right between family friendly without being dominated by children. We'll be back."}
{"text":"\"Overhype anything and you'll make a double double from In-n-out taste like a JBC from Wendy's\"   - Charles C., Twitter 2017  The same with Libretto. I spent a month eating great Neapolitan pizza in Italy where stone fired pies were 4. And they tasted the EXACTLY THE SAME as Libretto. It's amazingly simple. The dough, marinara, buffalo mozzarella, basil, olive oil. All come together in a great thin concoction that can be fired up in 2 mins.   Margerhita (cheese) - $15 was amazing.  Diavola (Italian pepperoni/salami) - $18 can be skipped. Too much going on in this pizza - keep it simple!  The frugal Charles does not approve of libretto. It pains me to write a non-80% review about a great pizza place, but the prices should be lowered by a good $5 across the board for the food served.   Maybe the ovens were a large million dollar investment?"}
{"text":"I've stuffed my face with many real Italian pizzas.  Pizzeria Libretto has wonderful pizza and great food. Along with a pizza from the twin wood-fired ovens, try the arancini, sfingi and finish with gelato. Great service to boot!"}
{"text":"I visited Libretto last weekend. Have a great experience with the food and the services. The server, Duke, was wonderful. He was super nice and make us feel comfortable all the time. The food was as good as I expected. Thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients, bottomless sparkling water, buttermilk calamari was crispy, great dessert, especially the limone one. Will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Sooo I came here a few days ago...with all the reviews I saw, I thought this place would be a fine pick since it was suggested for dinner...in any case lets get to the details.  Layout and atmosphere was all right. I guess a typical restaurant type of place. They had 2 floors to accomodate the amount of customers they had which was useful and also because it was busy, it made it seem that their food was promising. The top floor had a bar with a good number of tables around. The lower level had some tables and a smaller bar so it wasn't bad. There was enough space to get around to some extent.  Now food and service was baffling. Maybe it was the luck of the draw that we got a bad server who was indifferent and barely checked up on us. On top of that, gave us attitude when we asked for more water (mind you we were a table of 7 AND we were given only one bottle of water...cmon now) and when the bills were split up wrong which was CLEARLY his fault not ours. Don't give me attitude when you are in the wrong and ESPECIALLY when you are the one serving us. If you don't like us, get someone else to help us. We didn't personally request you.  Now food you ask? Well nothing that special. I was told this was an authentic italian place that made legit pizza. Sorry, if it's supposed to be authentic then it better taste good! I honestly don't know how REAL ITALIAN pizza is supposed to taste like but let me tell you this much. Sure the crust was thin but nicely baked and sure tomato sauce is supposed to be there...but it lacked cheese and the salami was hard like maybe overcooked in the oven? Is that how authentic italian pizza is supposed to be? I'm usually a fair person but with this, I find it REALLY hard to stay objective. That being said, I actually told myself i preferred DELISSIO pizza over this..ok ok MAAAAYBE just MAAAAYBE i chose a bad dish or something and I just so happen to get a server that was having a bad day or in a bad mood. But really, with all that aside, nothing was so special about this place. And if thats the quality of food going out and them charging that much just because they are using a fancy oven? Ummmm no. And if you are talking about ingredients? There was nothing special that needs the price of the plate to be jacked up...  Anyways, maybe I'm not the typical pizza lover and know much about pizzas...so I'll stick to the common ones that I know of and can enjoy them a bit more."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, true Naples style. Pizzas are a bit smaller than Famoso's but are tastier. The gnocchi starter was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place! The way they've set the place up open, yet cozy, and very social with those beautiful ovens in the back as the focal point is stunning.  I came for a late dinner on a Tuesday night and the place was packed both up and downstairs. Good sign!  I got the special for the night which was tomato sauce, basil, garlic and buffalo ricotta. It was phenomenal.   For the 3 of us to eat, and with some sparkling water and a couple glasses of wine the bill was pretty hefty, over 100$ for 3 people!!!!  Quality is good, service was good (although a little inconsistent), and I was a little bothered by the fact they charged 3$ for a bottle of sparkling water (which they make themselves) but when we finished our bottle our server brought another to the table and only charged us for the 1. Not sure if he forgot or it's standard which made me feel a little better."}
{"text":"Pizza was alright... nothing great. Ordered a magherita and a mushroom pizza but we weren't impressed. The crust was perfect but the tomato sauce and toppings lacked flavour."}
{"text":"The pizza is one of the best I've ever had. They offer different types of cocktails. They get you in and out as quickly as you want. Staff is very attentive!"}
{"text":"Forced into this place again!  Nothing here has change, in fact it is worse than I remember.  I  feel that places like this that focus on being trendy are really very sad and this place hits that nail on the head. Being trendy takes effort and usually takes away from the quality potential and therefore being good comes second.  To be really good comes naturally with no effort. Here they put a lot of effort into being trendy and as a result the place is crap. They have T.V.s... do i have to say any more.  When you need a distraction from the food like a t.v., you know you are in trouble."}
{"text":"Very nice experience here! Even when it was full they were very accomadating. Service was lovely and food arrived quickly ( the food got to us before we finished the bread). We ordered calamari and their feature pizza (pepperoni and sausage). The calamari was amazing, very crispy breading with soft squid. The sauce it came with was one Ive never had before. The pizza was good, not spectacular. Solid dough and sauce, and the ingridients tasted fresh. Very worth its price point (paid $36 for both) and would go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great room, busy packed at 6:00 pm. Reminded me of a NYC like Eataly. Friendly staff, great waiter. Delicious Arugula, pear salad, warm gnocchi fantastic. Mushroom pizza great, Brussels sprout pizza too salty and drenched in balsamic vinegar, couldn't eat it. Credit card terminal programmed to add gratuity on top of tax tsk tsk ..not nice! Tip. Share a pizza or two . Trying to get through one on your own can be monotonous. Really wanted to give it 5 stars but ..."}
{"text":"Short Review  The Wild Leak Pizza was great although the crust is somewhat burnt which I don't like. Plus it cost like $13 bucks so its not as expensive considering the pizza is cooked in a wood oven at the back of the restaurant that is also a open kitchen.   The atmosphere was alright considering I went here late at night, the booze really complimented it. For a steamwhistle/beer its about $5 dollars which its an average rate of pricing in Toronto.   The service was friendly but I didn't like when my server, Jesse (I think) called me a \"little man\" which was really rude."}
{"text":"I came with a friend at 7pm on a Tuesday night and we had to be sat at the bar because we didn't have reservations, so make reservations! The place was busy all night with a good buzz and I enjoyed the decor and the open kitchen to watch the chefs work at the woodovens. The service was very good, making up for sitting at the bar. Very attentive bartender, especially since my friend was late so I had to awkwardly sit at the bar by myself for a couple of minutes.   I had the Cremini Mushroom Pizza and my friend had the Housemade Sausage Pizza and we shared the Italian doughnuts for dessert. All the food was very yummy but a little delicate flavouring for my liking. Maybe it's because of the quick baking method that they use the pizzas didn't have the flavour I'm used to. Also they served it with a chili oil, but it had no chili flavour as far as I could tell, just oil.   My main compliant is the actual menu. I know this is an Italian restaurant and I appreciate the authentic touch of the menu and drinks in Italian but I wish in the description you got an english explanation or clarification. We had to ask our server to explain several things and then need extra time to consider. and it was obvious from our server that many people need explanations so we aren't the only people lacking in Italian vocabulary. Also they way they had the wine list written it was hard for me to choose a wine. I enjoy wine but I am by no means a snobby expert. I need to know what is a Merlot and what is a Shiraz in order to make a decision nut that it has \"woodsey undertones with a slight spiced and red currant flavour\" or the like. In the end the wine we picked was good (we did so based on a description that included \"pairs well with pizza\" so why not try it).   Prices were middle of the road towards expensive. Pizzas were like $14 to $18. Wine started at about $35 a bottle I think. For 2 pizzas, 1 dessert and 1 bottle of wine we payed about $100 if I remember correctly.   Overall, I would definitely go back, but there are some little things that could be improved. 4 Stars! Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"YUMMY  I hate the food on the Danforth.  Four pieces of previously bagged Romaine lettuce and a sprinkle of flavourless feta cheese for $20.  So I was happy to see a recognizable name in the middle of all that.  Sat at the bar, and ordered the weekday prix fixe.  Got the beet caprese salad, holy this was great.  I chose the nduja sausage pizza to swap for the pizza choices; this was spicy (for my taste buds) - good but I'm not a huge spicy fan.  My partner had the duck confit pizza which I wouldn't have ordered myself, and definitely liked more.  Gelato was creamy and thick.  Sparkling Hinterland wine was good but the pour too small.  Bathrooms were very subpar for the experience."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza there is many options. Fresh ingredients always and great service. It is very busy always so you may need to wait a bit to get a table but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The great reviews did not live up to the experience we had. The pizza was just alright and a bit overpriced for what you get. The crust was burnt black and tasted like charcoal and the waiter seemed so pretentious and cold when I asked for a bit more bread. The bread (and dipping oil) was the best part of the meal! Overrated and underwhelming, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service!  My bf and I ordered two pizzas that were equality tasty and despite the restaurant being very busy, we received great service and even got a free dessert because we were there for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise!  It was actually an AMAZING pizzeria with lots of great variety of delicious foods.  Atmosphere- Classy, Chill and Open to kitchen Food- Excellent Service- superb and great wine!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here as all the photos that I have seen of the food looked amazing but unfortunately my boyfriend and I found it mediocre at best. I must say that the waitresses and waiters and very friendly and efficient and we got our food very quick. The pizza was very doughy and seemed undercooked, it was impossible to eat without all the toppings completely sliding off. The buttermilk calamari was what I was most excited for but I was also disappointed as it looked nothing like the photos and was way too chewy for my taste. The tables are extremely small and uncomfortable and they are all put together so close that it felt like I was having dinner with all the people around me. This place isn't terrible but I don't plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"Service could use some improvement. Waiters have a bit of attitude... But the food is good so we keep coming back. Love the fresh homemade bread and grilled octopus with rapini. Great prix fixe lunch."}
{"text":"Changing my mind about chains (and general consensus)  Like Paul R, I'd never been to the Ossington location though I'd heard nothing but great things, so when the Danforth location opened up in the neighbourhood, I was more than happy to pop in.  Based on some earlier reviews, I'd already decided that the braised oxtail was a shoe-in and I rolled the dice with the warm, marinated olives and the crostini. Both did not disappoint and, in fact, the crostini was nothing short of delicious.  Since our bellies were starting to fill, we decided to order a single pizza - the Anchovy (tomato, bufala mozzarella, preserved chili, roast garlic) and, again were extremely pleased with the meal. All the ingredients stuck out on their own so every bite popped. Great stuff.  As well, even though it was a packed Thursday evening , the service was spot-on: very attentive, very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The Danforth location looks great. Love the cosy basement bar. But this is not what I want in a Neapolitan pizza. We ordered the margarite and a \"white anchovy\" pizza. These two pies were so similar that I'm surprised the the waiter didn't caution us. But the reverse was true. I started hedging on the sardine pie in favour a sauceless special but our waiter said the two were great together.  Whatever.  More disappointingly, the pizzas crusts were very soggy. I dont know whether the sauce was too cold or applied too thickly, but either way the crust was undercooked and underwhelming. It took about 30 minutes for the pizzas to arrive, and I suspect that may have had something to do with it."}
{"text":"I love this place. When I saw that they opened up the Danforth location, I thanked the pizza gods. I came by here with my bf and a friend. We decided to make reservations as the place does fill up pretty quickly. (I made the mistake of coming without a reservation once while I was starving so I decided to pass up on the 45 minute wait)  We had the buttermilk fried calamari to start and then the Ontario proscuitto and arugula pizza to share. The buttermilk fried calamari was amazing! It came with a red pepper, almond romesco sauce and it was just a great touch. Really brightened up the flavors of the calamari. The coating on the calamari was light and crisp... perfect! As for the pizza, you really can't go wrong with a wood fire oven pizza. The crust is crisp, but still soft and the toppings are amazing. Proscuitto makes anything taste better. We also ordered a bottle of red (can't remember which one) that was suggested by the waiter to pair with our meal.   At the end of the night, the bill was a bit much for 3, but you really do get what you pay for at this place. The wine was great and the waiter made a great suggestion for our meals. All the food was yummy and the service was great as well. Food didn't take too long to come out and we were well entertained.   Give this place a try if you're looking for some great eats on the Danforth. Not your usual pizza toppings, but they're delicious either way!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic neopolitan pizza and the calamari was so amazing. A bit pricey but the quality is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Loaded with hipsters, but really good pizza in a pretty space for a reasonable price.  Really solid pizza, nice ambience, good service. It's a bit pricey but not out of context for the area and style of restaurant.   I've only been once, but I'd definitely go again.  If you're on the Danforth and you want a good pizza meal, this is definitely my first pick. Il Fornello, down the street, is no slouch, but Libretto's pizza is better.  That said, it's farther from my house than Queen Margherita, whose pizzas are comparable, but IMO, better, so mostly I'll probably just go to Queen Margherita."}
{"text":"Delicious crispy Neopolitan pizza that I love, but seldom find.  The lunch prix-fixe is A great deal, $20 for any pizza, salad, and gelato.  Service is low key and friendly.  Wish I lived in this hood."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of those things which seems oh so simple, but can be screwed up oh so easily.  Thankfully, Libretto gets it right.   Thin crust? Check. Gooey cheese? Check. Fresh ingredients? Check. Crazy hot oven? Yessir.  Done in true Napoli fashion, Pizzeria Libretto brings Napoli style pizza to the Toronto in an authentic way, right down to the semi-wet crust in the middle due to the fresh mozza cheese releasing it's moisture, the crispy crust around the edges which show the marks of a truly hot oven.  If you're tired of my babble, let's just say it's GOOD. They have some good combinations (duck confit was great) and I guarantee you'll enjoy your meal. If you're not a fan of thin crust pizzas, this will make you a thin-liever."}
{"text":"Roasted Cremini Mushroom pizza was reeeeeeally good, and the server was attentive despite how busy the place was during their lunch rush. It also seemed to be very family-friendly as well. Their hostess at the time was a bit off-putting though."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Not the best I've had, but definitely worthy of 4 stars, maybe even 4.5 stars. The one fault is that the pizza is a bit on the damp side. Not soggy wet, but damp enough that the dough tears when I try to cut it, and the toppings slide off too easily. Thirty seconds longer in the pizza oven might do the trick."}
{"text":"Went with my family including our granddaughter. Excellent service! They quickly brought crayons and a colouring book which kept her busy while we had one of the many delicious craft beers. There were 5 of us and we all had a different entrée. Pizzas were delicious and more then enough for one which gave us lunch the next day! The décor was very pleasing. The noise level was tolerable considering the restaurant was full. All in all, very pleased and would certainly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Can I live here? Consistently amazing service, boozy drinks, awesome decor and the pizza...well, I already changed the name of my unborn child to Libretto Danforth, so yes, I like the pizza. (I used to go to the Ossington location too, but this cheerful, super-friendly, reso-taking outpost has gotten all of my business ever since it opened.)  Here's what to do: bring a friend. Get a red pizza (I recommend the spicy anchovy, $15). Get a white pizza (I recommend the gooey, cheesy mushroom, $17). Get some drinks. Dip everything in chili oil (except the drinks). Feel good to be alive. It's that easy.  NOTE: This is VPN (i.e. authentic circular pieces of heaven via Naples) at its finest, so any reviewer who complains about this pizza either simply doesn't know what he or she is looking for or has grown accustomed to their local fast food chain. But, as someone should tell Ken Ham, it's never too late to learn. The 'za here is not \"burnt\", guys. It is not \"soggy\". It's supposed to be exactly the way it is -- delicious.  Also, my second unborn child's name is Libretto Soft Housemade Focaccia, and my third unborn child's name is Libretto Lovely Waitress Who Gave Me More Focaccia To Take Home And I Ate It The Next Day For Breakfast."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. First time trying a salad and got 4 pieces of mozzarella with four slices of tomato (two overripe, two not ripe), barely a dash of olive oil. Everything came late in our order and I asked for more olive oil and some balsamic for my caprese which didn't come (so far waited over 10 minutes). Servers when they get to you are friendly and polite, everything with baked dough is very tasty.  Good traditional thin crust pizza. Just expected more from the non pizza items."}
{"text":"Those of you pining to try a slice from Pizzeria Libretto but can never get in on time to nab a table can take a sigh of relief, as the Danforth location now takes reservations (via telephone only).  There are 2 seatings, one at 6:30PM and another at 8:30PM.  East-enders can now enjoy some Neopolitan pizza without having to make the trek out to the west end.  This location is slightly bigger than the Ossington location.  Wood is still the main feature in decor.  The kitchen is towards the back of the restaurant, and it still amazes me how 12 people can fit back there.  It was interesting to watch the action that is the Head Chef shouting out the orders and delegating tasks to his staff.  The restaurant is definitely busy, and it seems that a lot of families have piled in here for the promise of better pizza.  The local pizza joints must be cursing the arrival of Libretto.  I came here with my best friend for dinner on a Friday night.  Thankfully we had reservations.  We were promptly seated and informed about the daily specials.  Shortly after, our server re-emerged with water for the table and also offered us some bread (which we declined in order to save room for our meal).  They have a short list of wines if you fancy a glass.  To my disappointment, most of the whites were more citrus-y and acidic (apparently, as per our server, to complement the pizza).   To start I opted for the Pear & Fig Salad tossed with Blue Cheese and White Balsamic Vinaigrette.  I am no stranger to bold-tasting cheese, but the blue they used was just too overpowering for my taste buds.  And that's coming from someone who loves all things cheese.  The figs were fresh, and the pears added a nice crunch.  For mains, we ordered both the House-made Sausage and Pork Belly pizzas.  We were rather disappointed to find that the carnivorous house-made sausage pizza was almost herbivore - there were scant chunks of sausage sprinkled atop an otherwise plain cheese pizza.  The pork belly pizza was essentially a plain cheese pizza with a few strips of discoloured bacon on top.  Although both pizzas were quite delicious (I loved the thin-crust), I expected a bit more grandeur and finesse in the ingredients and presentation.  My best friend adores 2 types of dessert: Crême Brûlée and Tiramisu.  So we opted for the Tiramisu.  It came in a Mason Jar, so throw all images of your traditional Tiramisu out the window.  I failed to taste any coffee or liqueur flavour in this dessert.  But I could definitely taste the sugar!  It was a sweet, sweet, sweet dessert!  Verdict:  Libretto has a nice ambiance and its a great place to grab dinner with a friend.  Their pizza crusts are yummy (almost reminiscent of naan without being as dense), and the pizza sauces are delicious.  Our server was great.  I would love to come back and try some of the items on the Assaggini menu (e.g. tapas and small plates).  But I think I will skip dessert next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times, the most recent being last month. I didn't have a pizza last visit, but my favourite is the cremini mushroom. This last visit I had a couple appetizers; the Flank Steak Spiedini and the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti. I would not order the Spiedini again. It was three tiny skewers of beef, almost 50% fat. I prefer my meat without chunks of fat there. The Ricotta balls however were sooo good. I also had the Chocolate Affogato for dessert. It was yummy, but I feel it would have been better with Vanilla gelato instead. I've had their Chocolate-Amaretto Budino before which is absolutely delicious. Next time I think I'll try the Sfingi (Italian doughnuts).  I would recommend this place for date night, girls' night, even just a quick, casual lunch or dinner among friends and co-workers. I haven't been to other locations, but I really like this location and it's convenient for me. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've never been to the Ossington location so I can't compare but I enjoyed their unique take on pizza. I've never had a flash cooked before but it was excellent. According to their menu the pizza is cooked for 90 seconds at 850 degrees. I ordered the Ontario Prosciutto with basil, tomato sauce and mozzarella. The prosciutto is added after the pizza is cooked; the taste was truly unique. The meatballs and olives were wonderful. It was evident these olives didn't come from out of a jar from Loblaws. The homemade biscotti was also a hit.  The service was great and our waitress was the right about of friendly and professional for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to cure a pizza craving.  The bread at the start literally melted in my mouth.  The pizza is perfect with a thin base and a chewy crust so you can appreciate the breading.  I love the Libretto now offers vegan cheese so I can actually have a pizza with cheese (I am used to ordering a pizza without cheese at most places).  I have gotten the eggplant pizza with the vegan cheese and never feel I am missing out on the real thing.  Service has always been prompt, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe because we were hungry, but everything we ate was fantastic! The meal starts off with bread, they add a little chili oil with the olive oil and balsamic which is a nice twist. We tried the buttermilk fried calamari and it was the most amazing calamari I ever had. They pile it high on a bed of red pepper almond sauce and herb oil and we couldn't get enough. This puts generic calamari with tartar sauce to shame.  The pizzas were exceptional. Even before ordering, the waitress explains how the pizzas are made so you know exactly what to expect. The ovens burn at 900 degrees Celsius and this gets a nice char on the crust but still leaves the middle soft and chewy. You won't get a nice crunch in the middle (like a good slice in new york) but it's not needed here. We tried the salami pizza and roasted cremini mushroom. The tomato sauce is so fresh (as are all the ingredients), but our favourite was the cremini mushroom pizza. It's not a tomato sauce base, but the selection of cheeses combined with roasted garlic and brown butter creates a flavour explosion. Highly recommend trying this one!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto!  I love their prix fixe specials. The vegetarian arrancini balls are super tasty. I've tried maybe 3 pizzas and all have been delicious. I'll keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"@pizzalibretto I booked a large group here for my Wedding Rehearsal dinner. I wanted something that had a private-ish area for our group, but had character and good food!  We ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools. There were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well. When I was planning this, it was super easy. They have a $30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses. Then I could choose from their menu any pizza I wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 3-4 slices a person.  It also includes dessert which they also determined on the day, but there was TONS of food and LOTS of leftovers.  I could also pre-order wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state \"white\" or \"red\" and it was ready to go. You only pay for what you drink.   The servers were friendly, and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up.  I loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging.   I've never been to Libretto before, but love that they have unique pizza choices, all that were very good. My favourite was the Spicy Sausage pizza. (as opposed to the house made sausage). The Duck Confit was good too but didn't have enough taste for me.  For apps, they gave us a bunch of food, but the most memorable was the Gnocchi and we couldn't stop eating it.  For dessert, we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazing.  There is also an option for Spelt Crust!"}
{"text":"This is in the top five pizza places in Toronto.  It's authentic Neapolitan pizza cooked in a wood oven at 900 degrees in 30 seconds.  The always have a cool pizza special, last time I had the lasagna pizza.  Oh, and good appetizers too, try the homemade meatballs."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! Our server was friendly and the service was super fast. You get bread and dipping oil and the pizzas came out so fast we hardly had to wait! Our server was diligent in refilling waters and I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent Excellent Excellent, this is definitely one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto.  The food is always amazing, the staff are friendly and super accommodating.  The Danforth location takes reservations which is a nice bonus when compared to the Ossington location.  Its generally never a bad idea to try the special of the week, along with the Sausage and or Duck Pizza's.."}
{"text":"Nowhere close to my pizza standards. We started with the fried calamari which was terrible, it's just a shitty disjointed dish. The calamari wasn't that fresh and it wasn't fried properly, maybe the oil wasn't hot enough but it came out greasy without any detection of seasoning. It sat in two tasteless sauces which were supposed to a romesco which tasted really watered down. Outside of this was a pesto oil that again had zero flavour. I knew when we started this way it wasn't going to be a good meal. We then had a margarita and a white mushroom pizza. It's just not my thing eating pizza with an uncooked middle. It's gross. The crust was the best part but overall I give the pizza 3/10. We had some wine so $106 later I'll never give this mediocre chain another nickel of my pizza dollars."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have Pizza Libretto open in the east end. We have been twice since it opened recently and the pizza does not dissapoint. The menu is small but judging from everything my dinning companions have ordered, everything is very well done."}
{"text":"Oooookay! I would consider and probably call myself a pizza connoisseur, and not just because I like the title. You probably don't care but I've lived in Europe and travelled around Italy where I had the opportunity to marvel in some really delicious pizza and some really bad ones ( I know, it's only pizza and I'm being dramatic) but pizza libretto has it down!!! The crust is perfection, the flavours are perfectly combined. The sauce and crust is the only thing that matters to making a good pizza. Libretto, with a few other favourites, will always have my forever love!"}
{"text":"Ive had the opportunity to visit this particular location 2-3 times. The food has never been disappointing, but I have noticed that since they have gotten more known the food has not been consistent. The first time I had the eggplant pizza, and I drizzled the spicy oil that they put on the table, the eggplant was flavourful and the pizza crust was crispy. However, the other times i have been back, the pizza was not as flavourful, it seemed a little saggy on the bottom. It is still a great pizza, but it seems to me that the quality has gone down. Maybe it has to due with the fact that the service is extremely fast. I also had the gnocchi fritti which was crispy and the tomato sauce was simple, I recommend it, it seems to be very popular especially if you share it with somebody."}
{"text":"Ate here during the Taste of Danforth after being hungry from the small sample sized foods and long lines of the festival.  Pizza here are \"personal sized\" thin crust neopolitan style. Or two people can share and also get a side of delicious Ricotta Gnocci Fritti. I enjoyed the Duck Confit pizza with a white base instead of the usual tomato base."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  I have been twice- the first time I went with my husband and the second time I went with my cousin. Both times I loved the food and so did my lunch date.   I tried the special on my first visit and had a marinara pizza with some amazing cheese- sorry to say I don't remember what kind it was but it was delicious. My husband tried the prosciutto pizza with arugula on top- also delicious and the ingredients were very fresh.   On my second visit I indulged in the lunch special and for $20 I got an appetizer, main course and dessert. I had the caprese salad with beets first. It was nice and light. Then I opted for the duck confit pizza. It was so delicious! The duck was spread out on the pizza with pieces of pear that complemented it so well. The crust is perfect and I ALMOST finished the whole thing in one sitting. I was excited to take a piece home though for later. For dessert- coffee flavoured gelato! Perfect ending. My cousin had the cremini mushroom pizza- although I don't love mushrooms all that much it looked divine and she really liked it.   The service is excellent. The prices are fantastic. The pizza is out of this world and the atmosphere is so inviting. I love the decor in the restaurant and I will definitely be going back. I have a tonne of friends already asking me to take them here for lunch.  p.s. they even have purse hooks under the bar to hang your bag!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is brilliant and just as good as at their Ossington location. Unfortunately, their wine selection is different here, so they didn't have the wine I normally order at their Ossington location (the Vesevo (dark and brooding with hints of chocolate ;)). So we ordered a bottle of the Taurasi and it was very good. Also, the service here is excellent and they take reservations (unlike their other location), so I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Pizza: Amazingly flavourful; great quality ingredients, especially the crust Service: Really fast. Efficient. Helpful Ambiance: simple, cool, trendy Value: Slightly overpriced for what you get; but would still go back because it is so tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best places for pizza in the city. Authentic Stone pizza oven that cooks pizza in 90 seconds flat. Thin pizza. Fresh ingredients. Always a line. Expect half an hour to an hour wait most nights. Worth it."}
{"text":"great service and great pizza. i think the menu could be better more pizza varieties therefore more appeal.  but happy and great environment."}
{"text":"Not a fan... After trying it out for myself, I feel they are overrated. I am not sure why they get such great reviews? Our grilled calamari appetizer was so tiny I almost couldn't see the calamari. We ordered the Duck Confit pizza and the Anchovy pizza and they were both super soft and mushy in the middle.  The service was also terrible. Our waitress questioned us when we decided that no, we didn't want to drink alcohol that night. I'm sorry, but I think I know what I want, and if I don't want to drink, don't make me feel bad for it. After we confirmed that no, we weren't drinking alcohol that night, service was non-existent."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say about Libretto that hasn't already been said, I'm sure - you should be well aware by now that the pizza is among the Toronto elite, if not the best pie in the city. My girlfriend and I frequent this location often (the reservations are key) and we've had most (if not all) of the Pescetarian-friendly choices on the menu. And I absolutely endorse them all, though above all else, probably the Anchovy pie comes highest recommended.  As if it weren't enough the pizza is perfectly made, the service is exceptional. They are always fabulous about reservations - I've been late before, and a brief call en route is all I need to hold the table, with no attitude whatsoever. Dietary restrictions are not a problem - my date couldn't eat seeds in it for a week (pretty tough considering tomato sauce is seeded by default) and our server hung around and helped us figure out what to do, and was more than willing to cater to our needs. They're always in a great mood, always dropping by the table to see how we're doing - and they do it with incredible tact, never going overboard with it or interrupting conversation...it's always genuine.  And the prices are reasonable, the bartender is talented. I couldn't find a complaint if I spent my whole life looking.  A+++"}
{"text":"Friday, September 12 2014:  Best upscale pizza on the Danforth as far as I can tell.  I've been here before; this last time was with my buddy for a pre birthday meal.  We got in just as they were closing but the service was still excellent.  And everything was available from what I could tell.  We began with the warm olives (yum!) and then shared two delicious pizzas.  One involved the house made sausage and the other was recommended to compliment it.  So good!  There was also wine, delicious, delicious wine.  Everyone needs a good friend who treats them once a year and everyone should try one of these fancy cat special oven thin crust pizzas.  This is the best place for one or both of those if you are near the Danforth."}
{"text":"We ate around 5:30 on a Friday. Service was polite, efficient & kind. Our waiter found some scrap paper for my son to draw on. The pizzas (1 Margarita & 1 mushroom ) were good.  My only complaint is that  it seemed a whole shrub's worth of  burnt, unchopped herbs topped the mushroom pizza, which made eating it very unpleasant and woody."}
{"text":"It's a staple in the neighbourhood now and you'll wonder how you ever lived without delicious wood-fired pizza on the east side of the city. Solid 3.5 - 4 star establishment.  The dining room had a great dinner buzz in the evening and the smell of crispy dough was in the air.  Time to get my dinner on!  I passed on the appetizer and went straight for an entree. The duck confit pie with pear and mozzarella was calling my name and I was 100% seduced. I ordered it with hesitation.  One thing I really like about Pizzeria Libretto is how fast the pizzas arrive at your table. It feels like it's lightening fast from ticket order to a gorgeous looking pie under your face.  I tore into the pizza and it was delicious. Lots of duck spread across the pizza and the pear added a nice sweetness/crunch to.  I would say another satisfying time at the pizzeria! :-)"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The danforth location is a blessing. They take reservations and are family friendly. I went here with family visiting from out of town, including my 1-year-old nephew. They brought in a high chair for the little guy and even had a kids menu.  Most importantly, the food was delicious. We ordered the Arugula salad and Arancini (risotto balls)- delicious! Also has the featured pizza (salami with hot peppers) and the arugula and prosciutto pizza. Both were delicious!   We will definitely be coming back here :)"}
{"text":"A favourite place for lunch or dinner when we feel like that delicious thin and chewy pizza crust. I love the decor, too, especially the lighting fixtures and black walls.  It can get really busy so make a reservation or go on off-peak times."}
{"text":"We decided to come here instead of the ossington location being a crazy wait list and no reservation thing. I called ahead and was able to make a quick reservation no problem. Got there and got seated asap. Our waiter was very nice and told us about their special of the weekend. The pizza which was the special called the Italian bomb... Was the freakin bomb!! It was the best pizza I've ever had. It had house made sausage, bacon, pepperoni and a white sauce (?). We also started with the crispy calamari which was really good good crispy batter and the sauce was delicious. Definitely recommend coming here and I can't wait to come back myself!"}
{"text":"Took my parents out for dinner here and it was a good experience overall. We shared two pizzas and a charcuterie platter with some appetizers.  I would try again for another dish but italian seems to be better in little Italy or vaughan.  Food: 3/5, toronto isn't the best for this type of meat platters unfortunately. It's not bad but not amazing compared to montreal.  The pizzas however were very tasty.  Service: 3/5, average, no complaints   Ambience: 3/5, very glad we were seated downstairs because upstairs was mayhem and typical italian restaurant where you can't hear anything.  Price: 3/5, typical, a bit overpriced as usual for Toronto but fair. It came to $150ish for four people."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the Danforth. Imaginative menu. Pro staff. Reasonably priced. Very very popular on the weekend."}
{"text":"I felt really taken care of here. We came in about an hour before close on a weekday so it was not busy at all. They had a pesto, mozzarella, roasted red pepper special goin on that night. But I just wasn't feelin the red pep so I added prosciutto and nixed the red pep. They offered to substitute another vegetable for no added cost but the prosciutto was $3 extra. I apologized for being confusing and our lovely waitress told us \"as long as I know what you want on your pizza, we can make that happen for you\" Next came some bread with a delicious olive oil, vinegar and chilli oil and a little bit of pepper. It was all delicious!  I would totally come back here. I want to try their cocktails next time. I only give it four stars so that I can bump it up next time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at around 1:30 PM and there were a few seats available.  I ordered the duck confit pizza.  I highly recommend it!  Also went with a quinoa salad and finished off the meal with a tiramisu.  Service is excellent and they were very attentive.  I would come here I can with a few of my friends."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Every pizza I have tried has been so good, calamari is very tasty thick pieces with yummy sauce. The only problem is the service. Last time I went I was seated quickly but then had no one come to the table for 20 mins which is usually the way it is. The only time I have had good service is when I have gone with a big group."}
{"text":"soggy in the middle overrated pizza. If you really know pizza you will appreciate what I'm saying. Pizzeria Via Mercanti is far far better.(best in the city actually) Hit up Terroni if you want trendy atmosphere and good pizza .They are better than Libretto as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good drinks, decor and apps, but I was a little dissapointed with the dough. It didn't really hold up at all to the toppings and sauce. My wife's pizza basically fell apart. Also, the hot sauce was tasteless and heatless. I enjoyed my duck confit pizza and like the mealshare program, so it's enough to return."}
{"text":"Just got back from Italy where it was so hit or miss with the pizza. Good to have authentic Neapolitan pizza whenever I want it, right here in Toronto. Sounds ridiculous, but it's true."}
{"text":"Great food but I find the pizza a little undercooked and doughy - however I am a fan."}
{"text":"Calling all thin curst pizza lovers!  Went here for a lunch on a weekend with a group of 6 and getting a seat was no problem. We shared a Piatto Grande as a starter with a variety of cheeses, charcuterie, pickled veggies and a bit of salad. and the best part - it comes with a big fluffy inflated bread - it looked like a shower cap! When you rip into the warm bread it deflates and it was so good!  For pizzas we went with Duck Confit with pear, which was my favourite. Anchovy pizza was nice and garlicy and Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula were also good as well. We finished with the tiramisu and it comes in cute little jars.   The service was friendly and the decor was modern as well. No complaints for this place!"}
{"text":"First off, YUM!!! I was lucky to be taken here by some friends for lunch and I was blown away by everything! The food, the service, the ambience, I did not want to leave.   They have a special lunch set which includes an appetizer salad, margarita pizza (or any pizza with added $$$) and dessert for $16.95. It's a pretty sweet deal for lunch. They have my favourite salad in the world too which is a caprese made with BEETS instead of tomatoes! I watched my friend have it while I sat with regret. However, I ordered the duck confit gourmet pizza which was umami. Beautiful thin crust, juicy duck shreds, braised pears, rosemary and fresh mozzarella, what more could you ask for? This was also a no tomato sauce pizza which are my favourite ones.   The service was top notch and filled with some jokes. The table was set nicely and I really enjoyed the environment. I can't wait  to return to Pizza Libretto and eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Really good wood oven pizzas.  Packed so go during off peak times and you will get seated.  The Margarita Pizza is terrific.  Simple but tasty.  Excellent tomato sauce.  Try it once and you will be back.  Promise."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with one of the best pizzas in the city a acompanied by amazing Ontario craft  beer and followed up by a delicious macchiato the servers here were helpful in locating other places to get food and drink in the area. And even charged up my phone for me so I could write this review I'm super happy and thinking about booking reservations for my birthday."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious pizza.  Nice lunch fixed price option.  Go now!  Go often! Excellent service.   Great food."}
{"text":"So glad they have gluten free at all locations now. Hands down my favourite pizza! You would never know it's gluten free. Great staff as well, always very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"Went to try Libretto for the first time during a weekday at Lunch. Usually a very busy location during dinner hours and weekends. I ordered the Hawaiana and my bf got the Salsiccia. The service wasnt that great. The waitresses seemed too busy to pay attention to customers and was talking to her co workers the whole time. She came out with the wrong order for my bf's pizza, we had to wait another 15 mins for another one. The pizzas were a bit burnt. Personally, it's not the best place to go for Napoletana pizzas. First and Last time at this place."}
{"text":"This pizza was lacking in topping choices and amount of cheese on the pizza. Basically they just put a few dabs of cheese on the pizza and let it go at that. If you are expecting a hearty pizza this isnt the place to go. I would list it as a frufru pizza."}
{"text":"4 years later & Pizza Libretto is one of the most consistent, authentic pizza restaurants around! I've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed - ya, it's busy, just make a reservation. They are true to them & you won't wait even a minute for your table.  The calamari is to die for - a MUST try - as are the desserts, do not skip even if you don't have a sweet tooth! Of course, the pizza is fantastic as well.  We've been here with friends, family and out of town guests, and everyone is always happy. It's casual enough you can walk in in almost anything & not feel out of place, but also nice enough to celebrate a birthday or something special. It's just plain awesome food.  There is a semi-private room for around 10 & it's perfect for a large group - but reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever tasted. The appetiser calamari is excellent. Try the Sfingi!! (donuts!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the open kitchen concept is cool. Can't go wrong ordering any of their appetizers. Arancini risotto balls are da bomb and so is the calamari. The steak skewers are tasty and the prosciutto pizza is... a little salty. ^^  And their Tiramisu is TOO good~"}
{"text":"Yes it is good pizza--I love a good gourmet pizza. Is this the best pizza in Toronto? I don't know. But it sure is a billion times better than eating the pizza chain cardboard pizza we've all grown up on. That they make certified authentic Neapolitan pizza in an imported wood-burning oven (the focal point of their open kitchen) might convince a few to believe they are really eating a slice of pure gold.   But here in the east end, we are blessed with a Liberetto that is much bigger than the crowded Ossington Liberetto. Most importantly, they take reservations here. Suckers!  You can't go wrong with either the grilled eggplant or the Ontario prosciutto pizza. The service is fantastic. Washrooms are downstairs, which also reveals an additional dining room and bar that can host private events. Most interestingly, if you bring a slice home and eat it the next day, it still taste fresh and awesome.  {TTC: walk your way to Carlaw Ave from Pape station.}"}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff.  Pizza wasn't anything to die for. Have had other oven baked pizzas with the same quality and taste (i.e. via cibo) Their appetizer with the Creme fresh was very yummy I could have licked the plate, I think it was fried potato gnocchi. Only reason I would go back is to have that."}
{"text":"I had to drop in here, after visiting the Ossington location last week.  The Lunch special was amazing.  I think next time, I'll have to share it with someone.  I couldn't move comfortably after the meal.  Ordered the crostini, rather than the salad, the margherita pizza (yum), and dessert was a chocolate gelato.  We were thrilled!  It was amazing.    I think i kind of preferred this location, mostly b/c it's closer to home.  But the beet salad at the other location was pretty good.  I would say both pizzas were comparable.    I think you just can't go wrong at this place, will come again."}
{"text":"Let's see.  If you know my reviews they're very short and simple.   Sunday afternoon patio- amaze balls  5$ mimosas- can't say no  Ordered the arugula salad (to share)- citrusy deliciousness   Duck confit pizza and Cremini mushroom pizza - about 10 inches spelt flour pizza the portion is heavy enough to either skip dinner or have a really late lunch - dry and a lot of crust (more of a thin crust lover)- though they said Naples style is thin crust (check the pics- def not lying)  - as for the toppings by far the Cremini mushroom wins by far the mushroom- cheese (including truffle, white, Cremini) combo is like a flavor combo like no other! It's a must try!  - I love duck, but the pear and duck plus cheese combo where it's wet and droopy in the centre doesn't get me going too much  - as for their \"spicy oil\" yuck- it's like a 1-2 chilli flake added to olive oil- doesn't matter how much you pour (believe me I doused that bad boy) it's like unneeded extra calories added to my already high caloric cheat day lunch- hmph   Obviously no dessert we were popping through the seams but I will add that our darling waiter spilled the bottle of hot oil on the table and on us---- but they said if there was any dry cleaning bills they'd take care of it.   I mean it's an experience - try the Cremini mushroom pizza ($18) but bring your bottle of chilli oil"}
{"text":"Simply amazing I want this 24/7. New fav pizza spot in Toronto. We had great service and the food was so perfect."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Pizza Libretto - ever since they had the one location on Ossington. I like the Danforth location because they accept reservations.   We usually order a round of Margharita pizzas - can't go wrong with a classic! My only one complaint is that sometimes the pizza is not consistent - i.e. with four margharitas coming to the table, 1 will look totally different (i.e. in terms of amount of cheese, how well done the crust is). Even with that, I think Libretto has the best pizza in the city. Add to that exceptional service and a decent price point, and we'll certainly back (probably on a weekly basis)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Love it! The place is super cute for a date, intimate, yet sophisticated.   Food: 1. Buttermilk fried Calamari: AMAZING! Perfectly crisp without feeling greasy, the tomato sauce at the bottom was delicious. Perfect appetizer.   2. Housemade sausage: it was adequate. not particularly my favourite. i just feel like ive had better pizza. which is strange. the caramelized onions were a nice touch to this pizza  Overall: Will definitely be back. i love the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"When you think of Greektown, a pizzeria isn't exactly going to be on the top of the list of things to look out for, but beware, Pizzaria Libretto is probably one of the gems in \"greektown\" that may sway you to try something a little more italian.  True to napoli pizza standards (aparently it's certified?), Pizzeria Libretto cooks up the pies in two large wood burning ovens that will crisp up a pizza in 90 seconds flat (they kinda look like 2 bomb shells).  This creates a thin, crispy and chewy crust that will probably have you coming back for more again and again.  They have a full bar, and I found it kinda funny cause they also offer \"unlimited sparkling water\" for 3 dollars.  I don't really like sparkling water, so I decided against it.  For all those interested, they also make Affogato, which is essentially espresso and ice cream.  First time I had this was at a family friends house and I have to say that I've been hooked ever since.  Order it (I don't care if it's kinda a dessert, order it anytime).  The pizzas come in a whole assortment of variations, but we chose the prosciutto and arugula and the home-made sausage.   The crusts were exactly as I expected, light, crispy and chewy.  I've had better, but this was still really good.  On the prosciutto pizza, the arugula was really good and pared well with it's buttery flavour.  The only thing I would improve is the prosciutto they used.  It was kinda dry and too salty, so that kinda took away from everything else.  The home-made sausage pizza was a definite winner.  There was a perfect amount of toppings on the pizza and everything about it from the sausage, to the caramelized onions to the chili oil was amazing.  Speaking of their chili oil... This was awesome.  I'm officially going to try and make this cause it was so good.  Put it on bread, put it on the pizza, just put it on everything, it's that good.  It's pretty much olive oil infused with red peppers.  it's not really hot, but adds that distinct character that brings the oil to life. They should sell this... I'd buy it.  Now again, this really isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it's definitely the best pizza I've had in Toronto.  Come in, hope that there's actually a table, and order yourself a 90 second delight... certified napoli."}
{"text":"Really bad service.. the kind that has you smack your forehead in disbelief of what just happened... The food.. Decent,  but nothing special.  One of our guests ordered spelt because she's intolerant to wheat and they brought us wheat... They came back 5 min later with a 'oh sorry' look and switched he pizza after she already ate 1/4 of it... Whoops!"}
{"text":"Maybe there's too much hype for the pizza at this place? I was expecting something more :(  We ordered the Buttermilk Fried Calamari which was really yummy (loved the sauce!), the Libretto Meatballs and the duck confit Neapolitan Pizza. I would've liked it more if they added a stronger taste to it, with more sauce - but it's a personal preference :) Service was great!"}
{"text":"There's a few locations for this Pizzeria, but I believe this one was the first. The Danforth is a pretty busy place so the biggest annoyance I found was parking.   They do get busy so make sure you reserve in advance, especially in the evenings. My friends and I went in around 4pm, it was very quiet. The first thing we ordered was the Calamari (one of my favorite appetizers) Libretto has a great way of doing Calamari; frying it in a buttermilk coating and serving it with a red pepper almond sauce.   We then ordered 4 Pizzas (we usually do a rotation so everyone can try a new pizza). We ordered the Diavola, Nduja, Soppressata, and Melanzae.  The Diavola is the one I would highly recommend; spicy salami, chili, onion & Kalamata Olives. The most interesting one was the Soppressata with Garlic, Soppressata Salami and Cayenne Infused Maple Syrup.   My only complaint was after the Calamari, our pizza's took at least 35 minutes which in my opinion was way too long. They did however apologize and treated us to some Biscotti which was okay.   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Two words: Exceptional service!  I made a reservations on open table. On the day of, I forgot to call to say that we would be late, and thought they would just give away my reservation, but instead, they called me and checked in. When I asked if I could push the reservation back, they gladly obliged.  We got our table right away when we got there despite there being a line up! Our waiter explained the specials and when we ordered, we got our pizzas within 10 mins! We had to remind them of our drink order and to bring us bread, but overall, the food came quick. We ordered a libetto Margarita pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both were good, but a bit cold (perhaps due to us taking photos and such). I liked the margarita better.  Afterwards, we ordered the donut and coffee. I told the waiter it was my friend's bday and he comped the dessert (pleasant surprise) and put a candle on the donut! My friend accidentally ordered the wrong version of coffee and the waiter give her a new one and comped it! Another pleasant surprise!   Overall, the experience was awesome! The music was pretty loud so we had to speak loudly to one another. The waiters did come by a lot asking to clear our plates. My friend is a slow eater so that was a bit annoying, however when she said so, one of the waiters made a joke and said he was a quick waiter, but gave us our space after. Jokes!  A very family style feel. Food isn't bad. I've been here a couple of times over the years and food is always consistent. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was such an enjoyable meal.   We went to the new Danforth location at lunchtime, and the restaurant was not too busy. This was great, because I've attempted to eat at the Ossington restaurant before and have been faced by an hour+ wait (albeit at dinnertime). The service was fantastic- friendly and attentive.   We ordered the braised oxtail special on polenta with roasted brussle sprouts. This dish was out-of-this-world perfection. The different textures worked very well (creamy polenta, tender oxtail and quite crunchy sprouts) and oh-so flavourful. It was visually beautiful also. They should put this on the menu permanently!    Calamari was good- what you might expect, golden and crispy with a chipolte and a black garlic mayo.   We split the funghi pizza- it was hot, fresh and very light. The crust was almost naan like. I definitely prefer this pizza to Terroni- and the pizza comes pre cut in four slices! (Way better then wrestling with it at the table and having it slide around haphazardly!)  Espresso to finish. Did not try the desserts but there is always next time. Usually when I eat Italian I have ``eaters remorse`` about all the bread and cheese. But here not so. The food was not greasy, very fresh somehow amazingly light.   Check it out!  P.s. The server recommended the duck confit pizza with pear for next time- which is  a) a pretty brilliant move to encourage repeat visits, and b) effective because I have not stopped thinking about it since. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Authentic italian pizza - good place to bring your kids too."}
{"text":"Okay this is serious! I don't ever give bad reviews but feel that I've had enough of this narcissistic pizza eatery. So let's talk food yes the pizza is good no doubt! Wood fired pizza is amazing but it's just that anywhere, but that's all it is.  Now they don't take reservations and your entire party needs to be present if you want your table. Yesterday I was told it was only half your party and that they were \"reserving spots\" at the bar. So they change their rules when they see fit, which is their right but it's my right not to eat there. They are unapologetic and slightly rude like a hot cheerleader who gets hit on constantly. Here is the kicker!! They told us to give them our cell phone number and go to another restaurant as we weren't allowed to wait in the their lobby. I started to laugh and told them if I go to another restaurant I am eating there with all due respect. The manager than came to speak with us and even though there were people behind us waiting we were told to wait next door. In the end I may just invest a few thousand dollars and help the business next door install a pizza oven so they can than welcome guests properly. Yes this place is popular but their prices are ridiculous when u really see what you get for the amount of food you receive the value just isn't there. I think it's time this place realized that customers are what's important. Ask not what your customer can do for you rather ask what you can do for your customer. Please join me in selecting another newer and friendlier place to eat next time you head out to spend your hard earned money. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were eager to check out our local area now that we're eastenders, so we tried Pizzeria Libretto the other night for dinner. We'd heard a lot of hype that it was great, and unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. They do have thin crust pizza and fresh ingredients, but overall, the pizza wasn't very refined. It was just so so."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times - I live right off Danforth, so this is my local pizzeria.  I switch between this one and Il Fornello when I want a good pizza.  However, yesterday, I was very disappointed withe the 'Prosciutto and Arugula' pizza.  The menu said it has cheese, but it did not specify that it was grated after the baking, not melted, and a tiny little amount (you can see from the attached picture).  I want the pizza to be overflowing with melted cheese and was mislead by the description in the menu, which mentioned the grated cheese in the same manner it mentions the melted ones for other pizzas.  The arugula was too much as well, and the prosciutto was really bad.  I love good Italian prosciutto - dry, aged, thinly sliced so the slices are transparent and tangy.  This prosciutto was wet, that's the best word, wet, pink meat, chewy and stringy.  Hint: hop over to Sobeys, few blocks west, to see what good prosciutto looks and tastes like.   The dough and the sauce was good, which is the main reason I come here, but the rest was lacking.    My girlfriend decided to take a break from her vegetarianism for the pizza, but after one bite - she didn't want anymore, saying the prosciutto was weird and too little cheese.  One reason to pay Libretto's premium pizza prices is for the top quality of the ingredients.  However, that seems not to be uniform."}
{"text":"Pizzas are good but not great..  The vanilla avocado espresso gelato is to die for though!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Ossington location, came to the Danforth one because Ossington was closed for renovation.  Convenient GreenP 2 minutes away.  Good service from the host/wait staff.  Food/wine is unfortunately not as consistent as I would expect.  The daily special was disappointing for Libretto standard.  Decent food overall, but I wouldn't visit this Libretto location again."}
{"text":"Dropped by for brunch with friends on a sunny Saturday. Made a reservation although it was totally unnecessary, there were plenty of seats at that time of day.  Our waitress was extremely engaging and friendly. Her recommendations were both thoughtful and delicious.  The pizzas were thin crust, but not too soggy as thin crust pizzas often get. We had the Nduja Sausage and the special of the day which consisted of a truffle-based paste. The Nduja was just a tad on the salty side for some at our table,   Dessert consisted of a lemon mascarpone tart with a raspberry coulis served in a chocolate shell.    Overall I found the meal to be superb and would love to come back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto is the standard bearer for the \"popular local pizza\" category. They have the classic ovens, source tomatoes from Italy, and do lots of little things to keep their pizza true to its Neapolitan roots. This can get frustrating when you want a non-traditional topping such as pineapple (don't ask), yet the white and red sauce-based pizzas are delicious.  In addition to pizza, they offer great salads, sides, and have a full bar.  If you are choosing between their three or four locations, this one is newer and less known. That being said, it is much easier to get a table here.  Service at this location is exceptional. They go above and beyond to provide a great customer experience in a town where this does not typically happen."}
{"text":"Naples pizza? Yes please.  My friends would tell me about this place and how I should go (well, the Ossington one).  My friend and I decided to come here for lunch the other day.  We went on a Tuesday around 12:00 or so.  When we went, it looked pretty empty, however, surprisingly, there were many seats that were already reserved, so we had to sit by the window sill.    Service was impeccable here.  The waiters were always there to help clear the dishes and asked if we needed anything else.  Also, they were very knowledgable about the food that they were serving as well.  My friend and I weren't TOO hungry, so we ordered the following: 1) Cumbrae beef short rib: Absolutely delicious -- small appetizer, but it was really good.  I really liked the fingerling potatoes -- they infused all the tastes in REALLY well.  2) Homemade sausage pizza: I don't think I've ever had pizza this light before.  It was cooked really well.  However, I felt like they had put too much of their chili oil on the pizza, so it got really oily.  However, the pizza was already cut into four, which is nice and different from Terroni.  3) Affogato.  The vanilla gelato was good, but I will still have to say that the affogato at Terroni was better.  Overall, I found the food at Terroni better than Pizzeria Libretto.  However, I may have to come back again to try another one of the pizzas."}
{"text":"On Point. Was craving their pizza last weekend, so went in without any reservations. Had to wait for about 30mins before we got our table. They have nice cozy tables for 2 right in front of the kitchen. You can see all the action going on right in front of you. They are a very busy restaurant therefore the kitchen is crazy busy too. I love to watch all of them working so passionately. We ordered Calamari to start, which was delicious as always. My husband ordered a Nduja Sausage pizza. Wish they had put more sausages. If you looked hard you could've found one sausage on every slice....lol. This is the only reason I am giving them 4 stars I ordered a Pepperoni pizza ans it was fully loaded with pepperoni. Was delicious   Will keep going to this place over and over again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great pizza I recommend this place! Everything we had was great, we ordered:  Ontario Prosciutto and Arugula pizza Cacciatore Salami pizza Glass of Gragnano   Both of us preferred the Prosciutto pizza because it was very very good, but the Salami pizza was great as well. The bread they served was fresh and delicious, the wine was great and the waiter helped us choose a bottle and even suggested we taste 4 different ones before choosing. He was really friendly and helpful.  Overall a wonderful experience and I would go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Lebretto has a cool vibe and is family friendly. Really like the rugs, its a cool touch. Staff are fiendly, polite and kinda awkward. Music was cliché as it was Valentines Day. THE FOOD: DESSERT Tiramisu was tasty but the cookies were soaked to long in the coffee liquid and took on a grainy texture. But still tasted good. Portion is small.   STARTERS:  The homemade bread is delicious. Really honestly perfect.  Calimari was small but good. Seriously is it going to kill you to add a bit more?  MAIN: Pizza's were a good size and tasty. But depending on the topping chosen, I had the eggplant, the pizza was saugy. Kids pizza had hardly any cheese. Two other Pizza's we order were good and enjoyed.  SPECIAL MENTION:  I had the same eggplant pizza on King st and it was perfect. Eggplant tasted good and pizza soft and crispy not saugy."}
{"text":"Food here is always top notch but the service is a hit or miss. I've had great service here as well as not so great service. All in all it's a great place to get great pizza and appetizers but the menu is pretty limited which may or may not be a good thing."}
{"text":"Well they have perfected one pizza,   the nduja sausage one.    I add pepperoni tonight and you have a masterpiece.   But,   just about every other pizza we have had there or others have had, has been mediocre.   The other sausage one with homemade sausage is tasteless.   So I can only tell you that the one in order rocks but all else is a risk..."}
{"text":"I love pizza, especially Neapolitan pizza. I've eaten more margherita pizzas here than I can count and every time my love for pizza grows stronger. We came for Valentines Day and I chose the \"special pizza\" with red sauce, mozzarella, basil and Cayenne maple glazed soppressata, really good, but my heart lies with the traditional margherita! The Capo Saisson was the perfect match, definitely a keeper.  PS Thank you Libretto for the sweet VDay treat, a pink and white meringue"}
{"text":"Had the prix fixe lunch here with a friend, and enjoyed every bite from beginning to end. Started with the arugula salad (with pear & walnuts), had the margherita pizza as a main & the cappuccino gelato for dessert. As some of you may know, pizza is not one of my favourite foods but, from here, I'll gladly have it again. It was one of the best pizzas I've ever had: thin crust, cooked in a wood burning oven & made with fresh everything... it was delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are just amazing. My particular favourite is the Cremini mushroom pizza.  I am so glad this place doesn't do delivery or I would be as fat as a house!"}
{"text":"Some things that we ordered: Beef carpaccio with arugula - this was pretty good. I like the freshness of the ingredients. Calamari - the breaking was good, as was the base sauce. Prawns - don't bother. This was a waste for $14 only to get three tiny shrimp and a very bitter coleslaw (mind you, I like bitter so this wasn't a problem for me but others didn't like it).  Cremimi mushroom pizza - this was my favourite for flavour with its creamy and earthy tones but the crust was surprisingly wet.  Eggplant pizza - this was spicy! And surprised us that the cheese wasn't melted.  The Neapolitan pizza - the Rosemary is right in your face, as is the saltiness of the pizza in general. No one else I was with liked it but I liked it."}
{"text":"I had read great reviews on Pizzeria Libretto so I was expecting some amazing pizza. In a nutshell, while I wouldn't say it was amazing, it was good. I'd give it more of a 3.5 stars if I could but a 3 wouldn't do it justice.  I met up with an old university friend to catch up and we split two pizza's: - Duck confit ($17) - came with roasted bosc pear and mozzarella - Grilled eggplant ($15) - came with tomato, basil, chili flakes, and ricotta  Both were tasty and had a good chewy texture to it but it just didn't have a \"wow\" factor for me. Comparing it to some amazing pizza that I've had over the years is probably not fair (Pizzeria Delfina in SF and Di Fara in Brooklyn). Those pies I've had at blow away the two we tried at Libretto. Like I said, they were still good, just not great."}
{"text":"I love this place! (Can't disclose how many dates I've taken here) The authentic wood oven pizza is always fun! When the waiter comes over to describe the pizza of the day, I'm just like \"sold\"!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great service , great atmosphere, great menu and most importantly great food! A bit $$ but worth it I think. The pizza I suggest order a couple and share that's the best way to try them all (lol). The tiramisu is so yum!!! This place is great!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch here after a few medical appointments. It was busy, but making a reservation was not needed. I have been to their other two locations in the city so I knew that the food was going to be good. Location wise, it's convenient as it's steps away from the subway station. I went to the washroom in the basement and noticed that there's a party room. It looks like it's a great place to have a gathering. The only downside was the service; it took such a long time to get water or the bill, which made me super tired. I'm not impatient, but I actually found myself tapping my fingers on the table. I hope this was purely due to the fact that our server felt overwhelmed? I love the food and ambiance here (along with the other locations) so I'll be back should Libretto Danforth is the most convenient.  A couple of details: - Reservations can be made on-line - $15 Lunch Set (appetizer, pizza, and dessert)  Good for: lunch, dinner, pizza, wine"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!   I associate pizza with snacking at school events, or lazy party food. I don't dislike pizza but would never order it at a restaurant. We went here for a friend's birthday, and pizza being their specialty, I ordered one!   The thin doughy crust paired with the right amount of sauce and succulent toppings made this pizza restaurant my favorite in town. The pizza here is exactly like the ones I ate in Italy.   After eating the pizza here, I gave other Italian restaurants a shot at their specialty pizzas and none of them were even close to it."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this!! Cozy, relaxed ambiance where families (with or without kids) enjoy a great time together.  Husband and I have been here 3 or 4 times within the past 2 years (before I moved to Toronto for good this year, yay!). Our servers are always friendly, very passionate and knowledgeable about the ingredients and their VPN status. The Fiore di Latte Mozzarella is to die for, I can eat just that on top of the perfectly blistered pizza dough. House made sausage pizza (with tomato sauce for an additional $1) is my favorite.  Their special ovens can bake the pizza in just 90 seconds. Freshness, top-notch ingredients, knowledgeable and passionate servers, I love it."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza cooked at terrifyingly hot temperatures, for low amounts of time, then Pizza Libretto is for you.  The ovens burn hot at almost 1000 degrees.  At that temperature your pizza takes less than two minutes to cook.    This leaves the toppings fresh, and tasty.  And the dough is a mix of crispy, and chewy.  It's like the opposite of badly cooked fish sticks (burnt on the outside, cold on the inside.)  Where Pizza Libretto starts to fall apart is the price - The pizza is good, and you'll be filled off of one.  But you're looking at $20.00 after tax and tip for a personal pizza.  With more filling options around the city, for a quarter of the price, you have to really want the taste of quality pizza.  This is not an every day, or every week option.  And, it's packed.  Make sure you get there early, and you grab a seat up top.  If they offer you a seat in the dungeon, just say no - claim you'd rather wait.  Or, come back another day.  Perhaps you enjoy the windowless cave-dwelling, reminiscent of 1980s Dance Clubs, and Alternative Rock bars.  But, it's probably not what you're after here."}
{"text":"Okay so where do I start....  The food: I had the prosciutto pizza, I have to say it was really good! I'm not always a fan of proscuitto. It really was melt in your mouth, it was super tasty, the crust was so thin and perfectly cooked, pizzas range from around $14-$18 or so. The menu was small, which I like, they focus on what they are good at and deliver a good pizza!  Staff: It is a busy spot, so you'll want to make a reservation if you are going weekends or evenings. I went on a Friday at 8pm and people were queuing, I luckily had a reservation though. The staff are busy but friendly enough. It's not a high end dining experience so it was exactly as I expected and I was happy.  Atmosphere: The tables are quite close together, it has a cool vibe, I got stuck beside a table with a girl who had a reallyyyyyy loud and annoying voice so I did rush out, not the restaurants fault so not going to knock them for that. It has happened me quite a few places.  All in all, if you're feeling like some pizza and you're in the area this is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Fresh! Efficient! Nice atmosphere! Wait staff is kind and attentive. Menu is limited so if you are a picky eater might not be the place for you. But if your looking to just enjoy some great Italian food then definitely go here! We had the meatballs, Hawaiian pizza, and a special pizza that wasn't that great but only because it wasn't really our style of pizza."}
{"text":"Super solid place for pizza. As a vegan this place caters to all my needs plus their new gluten free crust is exceptional. I can't recommend this place enough for their quality in pizza and top notch salad. I always have the marinara pizza with the homemade chili oil. Make sure to make a reservation atlas this place gets busy around 6pm. This is a great restaurant no matter the location."}
{"text":"While staff and service was totally acceptable, the two pizzas and order of arancini was underwhelming. Arancini was bland, cooked well but lacking in spice. I mean it's cheese and rice so it needs some zing. The accompanying tomato/ peppers sauce was hugely basic. Pizzas were hastily prepared and I'm guessing prepared ahead of time because they came pronto but even a pizza newbie can tell freshly stretched before it hits the stuffa (Italian dialect for oven). I was hoping for the best after reading  y'all's reviews but now thinking I should have avoided the aggravation of traversing the Danforth and stayed home doing shots with my sweetie while the frozen Buitoni's came to a sizzle in our own stuffa. It wouldn't have felt so overpriced had the food cashed the cheq the reviews wrote."}
{"text":"Some say Best pizza in the world others claim near perfection. The service was friendly was friendly but long. Private party rooms was a bonus. The soap dispenser was unusual. For some in the party, the wait was unbearable because our stomachs were famished."}
{"text":"An authentic Italian restaurant, welcoming staff, and fresh ingredients for a great price. I will definitely visit again when around."}
{"text":"My issue with the Ossington location of Pizzeria Libretto was how long I had to wait for a table, but the Danforth location takes reservations. So yeah...problem solved."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto is known for delicious artisan pizzas. I recommend the ones with the sauce myself, just because I've gotten a white pizza there before and found it too dry. Just my personal preference though. Do what you wish! I do recommend trying different kinds. Though I was just there for lunch and got the Diavola (Tomato, Spicy Salami, Mozzarella Di Bufala, Chili, Onion, Kalamata Olives) and so far that's been my favourite, so I will probably stick with that the next time I'm there.  I can totally eat a whole pizza here, and I have, but I probably shouldn't. If you are a couple, I'd recommend getting the meatball starter and a pizza to share. For my wife and I it was the perfect amount of food."}
{"text":"Well, I've been here with my bf twice now and I'm IMPRESSED!!! The crusts on these pizzas are beautifully thin but, still soft and warm and doughy, almost like naan bread. Definitely my favourite pizza in the city right now (especially the oyster mushroom one!). I'm a bit of a fan of soda water so the $3 all you can drink soda is a really nice touch. I've had Baccala and Calamari for apps and both were soooo delicious, even though they were a decent size, I wanted MORE!! The place is usually busy so a reservation is definitely not a bad idea although both times I've been I just stopped by and had no problem getting a table. I can be sure it won't be long before trip number 3."}
{"text":"Seriously thin crust Italian pizza, with fresh ingredients. 4-5 variety of Veggie pizza, and others mostly pork, no chicken pizza!  Love their margarita and cremenie mushroom pizza a lot.  The place has an awesome salad and starters menu, all are must try with so many vegetarian options, Aranchini my favourite!  A railbar, which basically means customized drink, along with decent house wines and some regular wines. On tap beer available.  I see fancy dessert list but haven't tried yet.   Go with a reservations on weekend, there could be wait for upto 1 hour. Parking on Danforth is generally not a big issue, but if no street parking is available go to small greenP parking lots all around Danforth. Ambiance is decent too. I have been to 3 of its location and love the Danforth one most."}
{"text":"Mmmmm another great experience at Pizzaria Libretto. I have only been to the Ossington location and this was my first time at the Danforth location. I love how it looked inside or the restaurant and the food was delicious. We had the arugula and kale salad to start, both fresh and delicious. As an entre I had the sausage pizza, it had the perfect spice and I am a sucker for their tomato sauce. I can't wait to indulge in a pizza dinner again!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and we had two of the specials which is a mergerita pizza, salad and gelato for $15.   Upgraded the pizza's for a couple bucks more and got the procutto as well as a duck confit and pear.  Overall both pizzas were very good, service was excellent and the place is very nice.  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great to see a new location open up. Been to the Ossington one a few times and great alternative to endless/mostly crappy Greek places on the Danforth. There really isn't much to add if you have been to the Ossington location, fantastic food and service.  There are reservations at this location, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Picking thin crust pizza in Toronto is like choosing a political party.  The big three seem to be Terroni, Queen Margherita and Pizza Libretto.  Whether it the decor, the service or some other rationale, each has it's hard core followers who will justify their fav for whatever reason.    Call me an undecided voter.  I've been to Terroni...once with with a Terronite and another time with a work function and left a little disappointed. Pizza Libretto was the second on my list.   I was with a group so I had a set menu.  It started with a hearty antipasto platter highlighted by some great blue cheese and a spicy spread.  The arugula salad was well dressed and nicely acidic.  I'm not a huge arancini fan but these ones temporarily changed my mind.   The pizza delivered, highlighted by the delicious thin crust. I enjoyed both the margherita D.O.P and funghi offerings and was a litle less impressed with the duck.  We ended with a dessert platter and none were disappointing.  The budino, in particular, was sinfully delicious.    The only annoying thing was the insistence on giving us enough food for 12 even though there were only 9 of us there (there were three no shows because of the weather).  Knowing we were paying for 12, we asked them to scale back anyway but it fell on deaf ears.  I'm not sure if it's the Italian way or an odd form of pretension, but some of us left looking like we were heading to a frat party.     As it stands, if there was a thin crust election, I'd be voting for pizza libretto for now."}
{"text":"Pizzeria libretto was a cute little spot on the Danforth with a small, but comfortable patio, nice service, draft beer, and good pizza. They don't offer pitchers, just pints.  They have specials every day and my friend (who is a regular) always opts for the special. It was about 13-15$ for a pizza. It was VERY good.  Thin crust, gooey cheese, eggplant, and lots of sauce. Yes please."}
{"text":"Really this deserves a 3-1/2 star rating, but we'll just go with this and I'll explain.  So I have been hearing about Pizzeria Libretto for ages and dying to try it and I finally got my chance. We went all out, so I'll go through the stuff I sampled.  We shared an arugula salad with walnuts and pears. Not a huge salad, given the $9 price tag, but was a really good salad. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi fritti. This was disappointing. They basically looked and tasted like tator tots with a sour cream and chive \"sauce\". I don't know where the ricotta comes into play, but these were nothing special, a small portion and not great in general.   NOW for the reason people come to this place. The pizzas. I had the Libretto Margherita (which is $4 more than the regular margherita, presumably because they use buffalo mozzarella, or so it is alluded to on the menu). My husband got the house-made sausage pizza.  These pizzas were excellent. Both reminiscent of what you might find in Italy, very thin, but with perfect crust. I usually go with the margherita, because it's classic and not too many bells and whistles, but I had a piece of my husband's and it was excellent! I'm not usually a sausage fan (no pun intended), but this was really good.   Finally, we split their sfingi, which is basically donut holes in cinnamon-sugar and with a strawberry sauce, caramel sauce or lemon sauce to dip them in. The donuts were nothing special. Honestly, I've had better at Tim Horton's. The sauces added a little something, but not enough to make this something I would order again. The lemon was good, husband liked the strawberry...the caramel, which you would think would be great with donuts, tasted burnt...to the point where it was inedible.   So basically, if you come for the pizza, you're good to go. This place does that really well..everything else...skip it. There are so many awesome little places in the area, I would just get the pizza and go get dessert somewhere else.   That said, because this place IS a pizzeria, I give it 4 stars, because they do the thing they're supposed to, well!"}
{"text":"you know a restaurant is good when there is an hour and a half wait when its 9:30pm on a wednesday night! so i ended up going to the danforth location after being told the long wait at the ossington location. so the thing you should know about me is that i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee naan. and the pizza crusts at pizzeria libretto resembles naan therefore their pizzas are BOMB. end of story"}
{"text":"I tried the meatballs and they did not disappoint!  It's all about the sauce and there was lots of it to be scooped up with the bread. YUM.  They filled in for a meal along with the other appetizer of fried gnocchi with sour cream, chives and lemon. I thought it was an affordable price for an appetizer at $5.  I love sitting at the bar here. You always meet someone and the bar staff are never too busy to talk to you.   A note: 9 p.m. on a Sunday and the restaurant was still packed!  Business is good at Libretto on The Danny!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and consistently great food and service similar to the standards set by their other restaurants. Thank you! Great establishment."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a group of 11 people on a Friday night. The place was loud and buzzing with activity. It was nice to see they had a private space downstairs that could accommodate us. Service was great (I think his name was Josh) and the pizzas were delicious! Nice selection of flavourful combinations. The pizzas were not overly salty and the crust had a nice chew, almost like naan dough. The really nice surprises were dessert. We had a blood orange sorbet which was awesome! And the Tiramisu was divine! Nice to know their desserts were all made in house. Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. I got the diavola pizza which was slightly spicy and the calamari. Both were delicious. The others on my table enjoyed their pizza and apps as well. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"One of my happy places. I love the food and service here. Watch for specials not typically in the menu. They are awesome. They also have a great area downstairs with a bar that is awesome for a large group."}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this pizza! SO AUTHENTIC! Delicious! Not cheap, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent beef carpaccio, served with a generous serving of arugula.  Pizza is so, so, not really sure what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"When I began my search for pizza similar to the kind I eat when visiting Italy, many people recommended Pizzeria Libretto. Not wanting to be disappointed, I decided to try this restaurant during lunch because their lunch special was very tempting:  Lunch Prix Fixe Monday - Friday $15  Primi Arugula Salad or Beet Caprese Salad  Pizza Margherita D.O.P or Marinara D.O.P.  Substitute any pizza on the menu $5  Dolci Biscotti or Gelato (one scoop)  And what can I say? I fell in love with both salads-the arugula salad has walnuts and pear! I love pears in my salad. I also love beets and mozarella. So the salads alone had me loving the restaurant. But now to the pizza. When it comes to pizza, I am a big believer that  if you can make a simple pizza well (my favorite pizza is Margherita-with only three ingredients), then you have proven yourself as a pizza maker. It's easy to mask a pizza with sauces, cheese, ingredients, herbs, etc. But how many can make a pizza taste delicious with 3 toppings? Well, Pizzeria Libretto certainly knows how to create a delicious pizza that transported me back to Italy. The three toppings on the Margherita pizza is tomato, basil, mozzarella and after the first bite, I could taste each individual ingredient; the cheese, the fresh basil and the homemade tomato sauce. I was a happy camper.   Another item that I always order but it is a hit or miss for me is the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti. How can you go wrong with house-made gnocchi with crema fresca, lemon, chives, rosemary? Well, it goes wrong when it lacks seasoning and the gnocchi is not fried enough so rather than having a crispy texture, you get soft pieces of gnocchi (I like my gnocchi crispy on the outside with a soft and fluffy interior). And yet, I always order it because when it is done right, it is phenomenal!  And.....  Always remind the staff about the free bread. Their bread is moist, flavored with rosemary, and worth the trip to Pizzaria Libretto. Now if I could only get the recipe!"}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto has ruined pizza for me, and I mean that in the most positive way.  I went for the first time in the dead of winter and the warm steamy interior was oh-so welcoming, thick with the smell of dough, sauce, and goodness. I had a cocktail (can't remember the name) but it was a smoked rosemary sort of cocktail which was really nice, strong (which you don't get at a lot of restaurants anymore) and complimented the meal well. My friend, being a vegetarian, had a white sauce pizza  with mushrooms, if I remember correctly. Whatever it was, it was totally yummy, but it didn't stand a chance next to my Nduja sausage pizza. Seeing it come to the table, I was worried I wouldn't finish it due to the sheer size of the thing, but I devoured it, and my friend hers. It was just pizza heaven...I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since that time, and other pizzas just aren't doing it for me anymore. The sausage was magical, the sauce was tasty and just spicy enough, and the crust was not too dense nor too thin and flimsy. We ended the meal with a chocolate gelato with some sort of crumb or crunch topping. It was marvelous and really capped the meal off right. We raved and raved all the way home and afterwards. I can't wait to go back. Haven't been to the Ossington location but would love to try it out.  I guess my only criticism would be of the service and the price. The service was okay; slow throughout the night but our waitress was nice enough. It's also a little bit more than I usually want to spend on a typical dinner, but the food was just...ecstasy.   I've been pizza-ruined. Thanks a lot, PL."}
{"text":"Top notch service, amazing pizza, great atmosphere. I loved it."}
{"text":"Mmmmm $20 pizza.   After a friend visited the Ossington location, we decided to check out this one, which we had heard was not quite as busy (and took a reservation, hurrah!). This was one of those restaurants I knew as soon as I walked it that I would love it.   If I could get the decorators of this place to decorate my future home, I'd be happy. I love the different coloured chairs - and the basement, which is painted with chalkboard walls, is fabulous! They even had a DJ - perhaps a friday night tradition.   We sat upstairs, and ordered the \"Libretto Plate\" which was divine. Not only was it presented beautifully, the food, including olives, salamis, warm naan style bread and cheeses, was absolutely delicious.   I ordered the pizza with smoked duck, and was blown away. First of all, the pizzas are all beautiful and have gooey centres. The duck was my favorite of all those I tried, but no one had any complaints about their order!   The service was also prompt and friendly.   I have nothing bad to say about my experience at Pizzeria Libretto - and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza shop in Toronto. Crust is crispy and thin but moist, cheese is nicely melted. Neopolitan pizza done right. Duck confit is one of my go to's!"}
{"text":"Really great! I mean not Anthony's coal fired in the states, but  I really enjoyed it here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Actually around 3.5  Haven't been here in quite a long time and I'm sorry to say that my return visit was a bit of a disappointment. The Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti that I previously enjoyed, this time around really underwhelmed me. The gnocchi tasted very greasy and that oil seemed old. They were also smothered in sauce; I recall them being crispy but very much not so this time. I got the pizza of the day which was a meat medley on a white pizza, and the middle of the pizza was mushy. It wasn't the worst meal I have had, but it was far from as good as I remember things."}
{"text":"We tried the East end location of Pizza Libretto for a ladies' dinner.  Wanted to get reservations for a Wed. night but told that none were available so we decided to chance it.  Arrived around 6pm and was seated in the downstairs level, right at the table next to the bar.  Ordered some wine and appetizers to start - warm olives ($5), gnocchi ($5) and buttermilk calamari ($11).  Their calamari is usually a favourite of mine but this version was a bit over deep fried.  Texture was kinda tough.  The coating wasn't as fluffy as I once remembered.  Gnocchi was coated in a creme fresh and lemon but a bit bland tasting, not a lot to it.  For pizzas, we got the classic Margherita ($13), Cremini Mushroom ($17), Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula ($16) and the special of the day which was a pizza with lamb and rapini ($18).    It's been awhile since I've had the mushroom one but it was great and I even loved it over my Margherita.  Desserts - how could we say no?  We went with the Tiramisu, Posset al Limone and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino, all $7 each.  The Posset was awesome...a light and refreshing lemon custard.  Tiramisu is always a winner.  Sweet and boozy, just how I like 'em.  The Budino was okay.  More like a chocolate mousse/pudding.  Service was great even though the restaurant was packed both up and downstairs.    Libretto is a great standby for an evening of pizza and gossip."}
{"text":"*** THE BEST PIZZA IN TORONTO ***. Basta. Stop reading these reviews. This is place is the best. I know it. A ton of other people here know it. Now you do too. Just make your way there and you won't regret it. I mean, just look at the pictures. They alone should tell you how good this place is. and their Tiramisu...mmm heavenly. If you're thinking of going on a Friday or Saturday night, you better make a reservation, 'cause the wait time can reach 40 min. However, once you try their Margherita pizza, you will understand why this place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I wanted pizza for my birthday so I decided to try this place out and I was not disappointed. I got the Nduja pizza and it did have a lovely kick to it. I thought it was weird that everyone was eating their pizza with a fork and knife at first. With my pizza, the middle part was pretty soggy due to the crust being thin and having all that tomato sauce on top. So I pretty much had no choice but to use a fork and knife to eat it. That is probably my only complaint. The middle part could have had a thicker crust to avoid any sogginess. Despite that, I still enjoyed my pizza.   My boyfriend got the duck confit pizza and that was yummy as well. It didn't have tomato sauce on it so his pizza held up better than mine. Would have liked more duck on the pizza and it was a bit too salty for my liking but my boyfriend thought it was just right. I also tasted a slight ginger flavour to his pizza which I liked a lot."}
{"text":"Full Review Blogged:  Focaccia and Italian White with Olive Oil and Balsamic:  Present on the table mere minutes after we took our seats and still warm, presumably from the pizza oven, I personally preferred the semolina based white to the somewhat doughy focaccia which likely could have used a bit less olive oil in the dough itself (or at least a few more minutes in the oven.)  Unable to separate the olive oil from the balsamic I cannot comment on the quality of either, but the blend was rather standard and unremarkable.  Crostini - avocado-bufala ricotta, speck & arugula, confit tomato:  Detailed as crostini secondary to the use of toasted bread this presentation was more akin to bruscetta in texture as the bread still had a pleasant chew while the toppings sat in an ample, rustic balance of crunchy/smooth and salty/sweet with the slight funk of the ricotta and brine of the speck both coming through with aplomb.  Potato & Ricotta Gnocchi - butternut squash, pancetta, pine nuts, pickled pearl onions & arugula:  Realizing it is always touch-and-go with pasta at a restaurant fancying itself a pizzeria I will simply note that if gnocchi is on a menu I almost invariably order it and in the case of Libretto this choice would prove most fortunate as the dish was the best savory of the meal.  Beginning first with the dumplings - creamy to the point of literally melting in the mouth - and moving next to the deft juxtaposition of thick-cut savory pork, lightly acidic onions, and bitter sautéed arugula the dish was hefty but fresh and bucolic but balanced - a dish rooted in winter but looking forward to spring with flavors befitting both.  Duck Confit with Bosc pear, mozzarella, rosemary:  The first of two pizzas and certainly the less traditional of the pair this pizza came with high expectations that were only half fulfilled.  Starting with the crust, a slightly sweet and well leavened specimen with a bit of blister but plenty of chew I'd personally put Libretto's crusts in the upper quartile of the Neapolitan pies I've experienced in North America and without tomato or \"wet\" ingredients on this particular pizza the dough held up nicely to the ingredients both at the edge and the center.  Moving next to the toppings, where this pie fell flat was actually in the pears - almost entirely flavorless and still crisp leading to an odd mouth-feel, particularly next to the intensely creamy cheese and supple, flavorful confit.  Ontario Prosciutto - tomato, basil, mozzarella:  A vastly more successful pie to the duck, though not without flaws.  Featuring a similar crust to the duck pizza, but with even more blistering and rise to the crust this Margherita was lightly graced with a sauce of milled tomato and supple prosciutto, both delicious and well balanced by creamy pools of mozzarella.  Where the dish lacked, unfortunately, was in the basil which seemed to be added haphazardly prior to cooking leading to some bites with a disconcerting amount of charred vegetal flavor while others lacked any herbal nuance at all.  Libretto Tiramisu:  Served in a mason jar, dusted with unsweetened cocoa, and a lovely balance of buttery cake soaked with espresso and a bit of rum juxtaposed with slightly sweet mascarpone.  A well composed classic not suffering from pooling of the alcohol as so many other preparations do this was a great dessert - yet despite this fact, the least wowing of the three.  Posset al Limone - chamomile granite, citrus & meringue:  This light and creamy presentation would prove to be a bit more panna cotta than posset, but leaving semantics aside it would also prove to be excellent.  Featuring a base of cream, lemon liquor, and gelatin topped with icy floral notes, crunchy bites of meringue, and fresh slices of grapefruit, mandarin, and Meyer lemon the experience was complex and refreshing with a compelling mix of textures, flavors, and temperatures far exceeding the standard watery posset.  Chocolate-Amaretto Budino - Hazelnuts:  Bread Pudding, Baba, and Budino - perhaps I just have a propensity for desserts beginning with the letter \"B\" but if any (or all) of these are on a menu there is a very good chance one (or all) will find their way to my table and in the case of Pizzeria Libretto there was a budino done right - no \"cake\" or gimmicks, just thick chocolate pudding imbued with notes of fruit and nuts plus an ample dusting of crushed candied hazelnuts adding both texture and sweetness.  Served, like the tiramisu, in a mason jar this was rustic and rich - just the way it should be.  The Verdict:  A hit and miss experience where the specialty (pizza) was outshined by the supporting staff (antipasti, pasta, and desserts) I cannot say I would rush back to Libretto for the pizza, but with a good location, good service, and excellent versions of two of my favorite foods - gnocchi and budino - I certainly wouldn't scoff at a return visit if I lived in the area, particularly as the pizza crusts show promise."}
{"text":"It's the best... good drinks, food and atmosphere. It's a great place to take guests from out of town. I highly recommend getting the tiramisu if you have room, you won't be sorry (well your waisteline might be...worth it though)."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a pizza noob. So when my friend suggested it I didn't know what to expect. Ordered the Njuda Sausage pizza and the Gorgonzola one and goodness, that sausage one is spicy! But Gorgonzola perfection was fantastic. I couldn't leave it alone!   Throw in a bottle of champagne, some girly gossip and perfect ambient noise in the background and you've got a perfect Tuesday night. Yes. A bottle of champagne in a Tuesday :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas and the best in Toronto! I had the margarita pizza and it was perfect. The sauce was flavourful and a tiny bit sweet, the cheese was nice and gooy, and the crust was thin and crispy. The venue was very modern and hip and service was phenomenally fast, friendly, and not pushy at all. This place puts to Pizziolo or Mama's Pizza to shame. This place is well worth the extra dollars you'll pay for your pizza. It's about $14-17 per pizza but your extra loonies goes towards the freshest ingredients. Pro tip: There's a small patio outside so snag it if you're lucky. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Any time I feel like going out for a delicious dinner (or a gigantic lunch), Pizzeria Libretto is one of the first stops that comes to mind. Lately I've preferred the Danforth location more so than the original Ossington location simply for the fact that Danforth takes reservations.   The food is consistently crazy good, with a rotating pizza special every day (and a meatless special on Mondays!). I oscillate between the Margherita and Grilled Eggplant pizzas depending on my mood. Smoked Scarmorza is AMAZING (tastes like bacon, without the bacon). Cocktail menu is small but spot-on. For dessert, get the Sfingi -- you won't regret it, especially with a Vanilla Afogatto to wash it down.     Service is also really top-notch -- the last two times I've come, I've been lucky enough to be served by Silvia, who is so sweet and excellent at what she does! All the servers here seem to genuinely care about everyone's dining experience, clearly away empty plates and wiping down tables, all with a smile on their faces.   A lovely restaurant for a night out, will definitely return again...and again...and again..."}
{"text":"So we were craving pizza. We didn't want some fast food pizza, I was looking for a proper thin crust pizza. So we looked up a few places on YELP and voila.... decided to eat here. We were not disappointed.    The décor was very sleek and clean. Service from the wait staff was oh so on point! The food was perfect. We ordered a pizza with prosciutto, basil, tomato sauce and cheese of course. We also ordered the calamari. Both were divine.  I loved the thin crust pizza and personally I think I could have eaten one of them all by myself... OK probably not but I would try...   There is also a lovely little outdoor patio which was quite busy. I would recommend reservations if you are planning to eat here for dinner.   One of my observations would have to be that the restrooms were not easily accessible(down stairs) for anyone with physical issues.(my knees are very sensitive)"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Pizzeria Libretto tonight! The service here rocked - the waiters dropped by a few times to check in on us. We came here with my friend and her baby. They brought us hot water to help my friend heat up the baby food, and did not mind the mess he made! This restaurant is very family friendly, it's roomy and takes reservations (unlike the Ossington location). We had the duck confit pizza, Margherita, and the sausage/onion pizza. All were delicious. I still enjoy Queen Margherita Pizza and Pizza Delfina on Ronces over Libretto, but not bad for my #3 pizza pick!"}
{"text":"Cremini Mushroom pizza not cooked enough in the middle, shredded cheese not melted. $17."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after hearing from multiple sources that it's the best pizza in Toronto. I don't know if I'd call it the best, but it was definitely good!  I went with 3 friends and we split the Libretto Margherita, Housemade Sausage, and Cremini Mushroom pizzas. My least favourite was the Margherita - the crust was pretty soggy and I thought the tomatoes were overpowering. I loved the Sausage pizza though! My only complaint is that the crusts were all really burnt in some places, but the pizzas were so good I didn't care."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials at $15 Monday to Friday till 5 PM.  I enjoyed my experience at Pizzeria Libretto Danforth much better than the original one.  The restaurant is so much more spacious... high ceiling, comfortable chairs and even a nice patio...  I almost half full after I ate my Arugula Salad.... the portion is huge and have almost a whole pear inside... a little over dressed for my preference but it is GOOD!  Margarhita pizza with oozing cheese and oh so fresh basil leaves.. I ate the whole thing...   Espresso Gelato, what a sweet ending..  All this washed down by a glass of \"Anna 6\" white wine ($5)  The sun is shining bright and the warm is warm... I kind of feel like I am in Naples?   La vita è Bella!"}
{"text":"Amazing service from a crazy lady, incredible bread dip (it's free, ask for more) & delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service. The prices are a little steep, but the quality is definitely there. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I just realize that I have never done any post about my fave pizza place in Toronto, Pizzeria Libretto (@PizzaLibretto) (@pldanforth). I have been to the the Ossington location many times and have been willing to wait for more than an hour in line since they don't take reservation (that's a lot coming from me since I hate waiting). They have open up a second location at Danforth since and take reservation....  The Danforth location is much larger and have 2 of their Wood Fired Oven instead of one. Love is mix and match chairs (^_^)  Love how they have choice of wine by the glass, quartino, half liter and bottle on all of the White & Reds. Since Ben decided to get beer, I went ahead and order the quartino (quarter liter) which was perfect for myself since one glass is never enough to last through the meal.   The menu from this location have a lot more appetizers to choose and I'll have to come back to try all the rest since I love all of them so much (^_^)  Gnocchi Fritti Lemon $5 ~ lemon, chives & crema fresca ~ This was fresh, hot and fluffy crispy. Love gnocchi + Love fried anything = LOVE  Mushroom Stracci ~ This is not on their menu anymore but this was really good, just packed with mushroom flavors. ~ When I ordered this I thought it's mushroom on top of pasta, but the mushroom was actually  mix into the pasta dough itself... just incredible    Rocco's Salad $10 ~ brussels sprouts, butternut squash, Pingue prosciutto, heriloom beets, pine nuts, ricotta salata & crispy egg ~ Love how lightly dressed it was, letting each part of the salad shine through complimenting each other.  ~ So good and refreshing... and I love loved beets and doesn't hurt that it's top with a medium cook egg that the yolk just ouzzes out when you cut into it ;)   Duck Confit Pizza $17 ~ bosc pear, mozzarella ~ This is my fave pizza of all time and since it's been a while, I just have to order this again cause the sweet pear, the creamy mozzerealla together with the duck confit is just heavenly =P ~ Just as good as always, the fresh crispy thin flavorful crust only achievable with the super hot wood burning oven plus their unique and fresh toppings... a bite is all you need to fall in love  ~ (I promise myself to try others next time I go)   Quattro Formaggi Pizza $18 ~ tomato, truffle, bufala mozzarella, montasio, moliterno, parmigiano reggiano ~ Don't get me wrong, I love cheese but I never really liked order 3 or 4 cheese pizza since it tends to be too salty for me.... and that definitely what I thought about this one but Ben really wanted to order this   Vanilla Affogato $5 ~ gelato drowned in espresso ~ Found the espresso not as hot as we would like it so that it start melting the ice cream.  Verdict : ~ LOVE LOVE LOVE ~ Love this 2nd location even more since it's more spacious, take reservation and have so many apps to choose from. ~Will go back for more (^_^)"}
{"text":"I loved everything about my visit to the Ossington location of Pizzeria Libretto, except for the hour long wait. Enter the Danforth location which, to my delight, accepts reservations! The capacity is also a lot bigger. On this particular Saturday night, I managed to score a seat by the window at 8 pm without reservations!  First off, we started with gnocchi fritti with lemon, chives and crema fresca ($5). I loved the crispiness of the fried exterior, and I thought this would be the perfect snack to go along with a pitcher of cold beer. The creamy lemon crema fresca was also super tasty, and I would definitely order this again next time.  Next up, we had spicy meatballs with tomato sauce, bomba, grana padano and crostino ($9). I haven't had a lot of Italian meatballs in my life, but I have to say that this was the best I've ever had! The meatballs were incredibly juicy and bursting with rich meaty flavours, and that tomato sauce was absolutely scrumptious! I really wished I had more bread to soak up all that delicious goodness! In the end, I used the leftover sauce as a dip for my pizza crust. Not a drop went to waste!  It was a hard decision to choose a pizza, but we ended up going for the daily special pepperoni pizza ($16). The pizza was just as amazing as I remembered it to be from my Ossington experience. One bite in, and I was reminded why the pies here are repeatedly voted the best in Toronto. I was so tempted to order a second pizza, but wisely resisted the urge to save room for dessert. But I'll definitely be back soon to try their famous duck pizza!  We were in a bit of a sweet mood so we ordered two desserts that night- Libretto tiramisu ($7) and posset al limone ($7) with chamomile granite, citris and meringue. Both were excellent! The tiramisu (which I've had before) was a dream of creamy deliciousness adorably served in a mason jar. The lemon posset (a thickened cream dessert) also impressed me. I really enjoyed the textural mix of creamy, crunchy, and icy altogether in a bowl, topped with a refreshing addition of citrus fruits. Needless to say, the two desserts left me very satisfied.  All in all, it was another sensational meal at Pizzeria Libretto! Everything- from appetizers to desserts- was executed brilliantly and I can't wait to come back for more pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been a neighbourhood regular since they opened. I like the food. And I used to like the service. But it's gone steadily downhill with overly casual, slow, distracted service. Tonight, a new low: we were greeted with the ever-welcoming \"hey!\"; our sparkling water was conveniently delivered across the aisle at the empty table next to us; we were told to wait when we were ready to order our dinners because our server wasn't ready to take it; a knife was dropped never to be replaced (thankfully we had generous neighbours). After this experience, at bill time, a more polished, perky server showed up with the credit card machine and its preprogrammed 17% tip (this has happened before). The system has broken at Libretto. Please fix it. Libretto used to be a treat. Convince me to return!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Apps were good. The Rocco salad in particular was delicious! I recommend the Libretto Margharita pizza. The tomatoes were so fresh and flavourful. The cremini mushroom pizza was just okay. Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"So good!  The food was incredible (as always) and the ambience/customer experience is always enjoyable.   We had a few pizzas for our party and nearly all of us had the meatballs. Such a great place to enjoy stone baked pizza.   Love it and will a absolutely return"}
{"text":"Perhaps this is controversial of me, but I prefer the Danforth location to the Ossington location.   Same great lunch prix fixe ($15 for an arugula salad and a perfectly plain pizza) plus a calmer atmosphere, and they appear to have a full bar instead of just wine, beer and a couple of cocktails.   Same perfect pizza you've come to enjoy, only a little more grown up. The servers are also run less ragged and therefore kinder, and who doesn't love kindness? Ass holes. I guess ass holes don't love kindness, but I digress...   PEPPER POINTS for taking reservations. Is it really so hard, people? Do you think it makes you seem thaaat much cooler? I'm darn sick of not being able to reserve my tasty treats in advance, Tarana."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but it's like being at a Chucky Cheese - ton of kids unattended, one actually riding around on his bike..................no thanks.  Note this is for the Danforth location."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto currently does offer the best Napoli style pizza in the city. Every time we decide to go I get excited, but usually find I am disappointed pretty quickly when I am there.   First, the dough is great. And that's what you have to start with with these pizzas. The cheese is always quite good too on the margarita. However, I get majorly disappointed by the tomatoes. They never taste sweet like other San Marzano tomatoes I have experienced on these kinds of pizzas.   I also wouldn't recommend getting the buffalo mozzarella. It's not better enough here to make it worth the extra money.   The servers are usually nice (though this has not always been true the 7-8 times I've been), but the pizzas are always insanely slow to arrive!! I never understand why either, since the place isn't full and the pizzas are meant to cook in under 2 minutes or less...?   I will say if you can get in for their lunch specials with the salad and dessert, do it. The salad and beet option are both winners, and the biscotti is quite good here too."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here this past weekend for his birthday dinner. I had heard great things from friends and it's rated the #1 pizza place on Blog TO.  I made our reservation about a month in advance and we had to wait about 5 minutes when we got there because the people at the table they had for us decided to order another bottle of wine. They ended up giving us a table downstairs.  I had told the restaurant over the phone that it was my boyfriends birthday and they said they would do some kind of dessert for it.  We decided to order some apps before the meal. We got the gnocchi and Roccos salad. Both very delicious!  For the main I got the duck confit pizza which had no sauce and pear on it. It was absolutely unreal. Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. My boyfriend got some spicy pepperoni pizza, it wasn't listed on the menu because it was the special of the day.  During the meal I got up to remind our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday and he said he would bring something over.   After we finished the waiter came over with the dessert menu. I was hoping my boyfriend wouldn't order anything because we were gonna get something for free. He ended up ordering an espresso and a gelato, and I ordered a chocolate affogato.  The waiter ended up bringing a wooden plate that said happy birthday in nutella and had both our desserts on it. I figured since he picked a dessert off the menu it would not be included on the bill. Turns out it was and that's the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I don't mind paying but if they said they would include something they should. Oh well!  Overall it was great. Good service, amazing food and a cool environment! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Although I had a pleasant time at PL I was disappointed with my Pizza.  I had heard good things about it and had been recommended here by a friend so I had high hopes. I ordered the homemade sausage pizza and it was just awful, the \"gooey\" base was more soggy/slimey and it was drowned in oil. It was a very bland taste, probably due to the amount of oil. Even though I didn't enjoy my pizza I did really enjoy the dessert! I had the sfingis and they where delicious! And my fiancé had the espresso and cinnamon gelato and that too was very tasty. The service was excellent and the staff was friendly, again just a shame about the pizza."}
{"text":"We arrived Saturday night for our 9pm reservation which I was thankful I made as the place was packed as usual. Only two vacant tables available, one of course which was for me.  We were seated at a cozy table towards the back of the restaurant beside the white brick wall with a wonderful view of the 2 wood burning ovens and the chefs hard at work. The restaurant has an industrial look to it with the exposed vents and piping on the ceiling, glazed concrete floors, and pops of colour from the multi-coloured hanging wired lights and different coloured metal chairs.  Our waitress for the evening comes over and highlights the specials for night and takes our drink orders.  Two Glasses of bubbly refreshing Prosecco arrives. Truly delicious and imported exclusively for Libretto, I had to pace myself to keep from chugging the glass down. As well I love how the water is served in chilled glass bottles so I don't to wait on a refill, I can top it up myself!  After taking our food order, our waiter asks if we would like some bread. It's nice that they ask for those who are worried about filling up before the meal however turning down bread is never an option for me so I gladly accepted her invitation. Warm sliced bread returns with a mixture olive and balsamic.  To start  Spicy Meatballs -Tomato sauce, bomba, grana padano & crostino I love me some meatballs and Libretto knows how to do it exceptionally well. Juicy, tender meat, full of flavour sitting in a bed of that delicious tomato sauce with the slightest kick of heat to compliment it. I would have liked some more of the toasty bread to mop of the rest of the sauce however our waitress took notice in our enjoyment of the sauce and offered to bring us some more house bread which we kindly appreciated.  Arugula Salad - Pear, walnuts, piave cheese & sherry vinegar Very fresh tasting, I enjoyed the mixture of flavours with the tartness from the vinegar dressing, sweetness from the pears, and the crunch from the salted toasted walnuts was the perfect balance of flavours & textures.  Pizza Margherita D.O.P. - Tomato, basil, mozzarella I can not resist a crust prepared in a wood burning oven. The char and blistering on the thin chewy crust is phenomenal on its own but then throw on some of there delicious homemade tomato sauce dotted with gooey fresh mozzarella and hints of fresh basil leaves you a yummy carb induced coma.   Dessert Chocolate-Amaretto Budino - Topped with fresh whipped cream and macerated strawberries The sweet cream and fresh strawberries were a pleasant surprise to the addition of my budino. The budino however was the perfect ending to a savory meal. Not overly sweet but the perfect combination of thick chocolatey goodness with hints amaretto coming through was deeply satisfying.  Overall a spectacular Italian meal served up at Libretto with excellent service and fresh, hot, delicious dishes, not a flaw from start to finish. Definitely check it out but I'd suggest making reservations to ensure you get a table.  FYI They don't serve tea here however our waitress kindly offered to bring me some hot water and lemon. However I opted for an Americano instead and I was not the least bit disappointed. It was exceptionally good, strong rich aromatic flavour, not the slightest taste of bitterness with a nice crema on top."}
