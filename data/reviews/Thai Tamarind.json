{"text":"Much better than the old place, although not my fav Thai place. Portion sizes are reasonable and the service is much better. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"The Thai Tamarind had been suggested to me by my foodie friend as being the BEST new restaurant in Pittsburgh. Those are BIG WORDS.  I like something comfy and cozy. I dont want to get all dress up. A group of eight friends from the Shadyside area took the short drive chatting along the way and went last night. Tucked around the bend on Lincoln Ave in Bellevue is the cute and quaint TT.
 Wonderful decor, soft lighting, real candles with fresh flowers and linen on each table.
 Waitress Dear ( so if I write you a letter it would be DEAR DEAR) explained the specials and made recommendations. Prompt, relaxed service. The various Appetizers and main courses everyone ordered were superbly prepared and presented. Price is Right, too. A REAL TREAT!"}
{"text":"Stopped in over the holidays and the food was glorious. The spice was completely to scale. Make sure to remember your wine as the place is BYOB. 

The atmosphere was relaxing- I told my partner it's like a yoga studio with good vibes. Our comfort food is Thai curry dishes and we weren't disappointed. The restaurant is off the beaten path but worth the detour."}
{"text":"This place is great! We are so excited to have found some good Thai food near Sewickley. I guess they got new ownership 5 months ago. 
We had the Massaman curry and it was fantastic - super fresh and delicious. There is an amazing homemade chili sauce you can ask for to accompany your food. The Pad Thai was fairly good, slightly sweeter than I like, but still delicious, and the shrimp in it was great. I squeezed lime on mine. Yummy salad too. We will be back, excited to try everything else."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place yesterday for take out. My friend and I ordered the mango curry with chicken, the Thai spring rolls (veg), and the pad Thai (veg). I called to place my order and was told fifteen minutes, left immediately and my food was waiting for me when I arrived at the restaurant. Everything was there and it was all delicious. The spice was good and they even included two complimentary salads. Will have to sit in and try more of the menu but this is definitely an easy 4.5 so far. Good food, friendly service and fair prices."}
{"text":"I am very happy with finding this needle in the hay stack so close to my home. Delicious food- the potstickers were ideal. I lived in Japan for 3 years and have been searching for a gyoza that tasted just as good and the potstickers here did not disappointed. My husband and I both ordered curry and it was perfect. There was only one waitress and the place kept bringing people in. She did great. Friendly, attentive, and answered all of our questions. We found out there is take out too! I am very excited about doing that in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The Soft shell crab wrap and the Thai Tamarind Noodles (I got the chicken, steak and shrimp combination) were amazing. Add a bar and some sushi and I would never leave"}
{"text":"Decent selection of authentic Thai. The wild curry is the best in Pittsburgh, competing with Thai Gourmet, and Smiling Banana. The only reason it's 3 stars, is  the green curry is a too sweet, which ruins the palate as you go on to your next curry or noodle entree. They also use canned sweetened pineapple that ruins whatever dish it is in. --- One tip for the uninitiated - order spice level 3-5 to enjoy your food, and never drink cold water, best with pale ale or lager beer to cool your palate between entrees."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, and got what we expected from the other reviews. While not exquisite, the green curry and duck curry were both very enjoyable! The sliced chicken in the green curry was, well, okay. It seemed to us that some of the veggies, such as the eggplant and bell peppers, were quite fresh; but that others, such as the peas and string beans, were pre-frozen. In sum, Thai Tamarind has the potential to take their game to the next level, but to do so, they need to use ALL fresh ingredients. All of that said, we will almost certainly eat there again. On the personal note, they were friendly, and the inside of the restaurant was quite charming."}
{"text":"I love it here. It's great spot to do dinner with friends. The Thai pineapple fried rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the shrimp appetizer and the panang curry. Some menu items are not that great but it's the best restaurant in Bellevue that's for sure. Although that's not a particularly hard feat...."}
{"text":"I'll start with my only complaint - they say they deliver, but it's hit or miss for whether they actually have a driver working.

On to the pros. Their food is fresh, fast and really delicious. It stands up pretty well to Nicky's Thai (hence the delivery critique - we will almost always default to delivery, so if their driver isn't working then we just hang up and call Nicky's). Portions are large, and their curries are amazing. My husband loves the fried duck curry and I'm a big fan of the shrimp/scallop curry. Try the appetizer sampler as well!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the last couple of years as it's been passed between owners. We have always had a good experience but we have friends that have not. The hours seem to be somewhat off and on depending on who the owner was.

Food is good and the atmosphere is pretty good as well. It's definitely worth a try if you like Thai."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday and one other time. Food is very very good. Service is excellent. Will go back at another time. Quantity of food is very good.Both times had food to take home."}
{"text":"Food was just okay, but service was awful.  We waited so long to even order and then again to pay our check.  The food came out relatively quick but they only had one person doing everything in the front.  She walked back and forth all night as we waited and waited.  

Would not come back or recommend this place unfortunately based on this experience.  The server was friendly but just way too slow."}
{"text":"Ok Thai, but nothing that great. I've had the pad Thai, pad kee Mao, and Kao soi on a few different trips. Everything tastes pretty good, but I still think Nicky's beats them. 

The most recent time I ordered, I decided to try the Kao soi veggie...the menu on their website said 12.50 but when I arrived for pickup I was charged $16 for the veggie. It is a good portion of food, but I probably wouldn't get it again.

All in all a cool spot in Bellevue if your looking for your Thai fix, but if you want the good stuff just head down the road to the North side."}
{"text":"unbelievable!! this place is a gem. we ordered 3 dishes. all of them were unreal. thai chick fried rice. pad thai chick. basil tofu.  do yourself a favor and check them out."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's like Nikkis,  but without the long waits for a table.  

The quality of food is on point with the service exceptional. 

I'll be sad when this place takes off and becomes busy."}
{"text":"Delicious food, comfortable ambiance, and friendly service. I really enjoyed everything about our meal here."}
{"text":"Small place in a quiet neighborhood. Clean and classy.  Had the wonton soup and the orange chicken spicy level 2. Legit spice level. Should have went up to a 3.  Excellent flavor. High quality Thai.  Service was great.  Price is a legit $$."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. I live in the neighborhood and love Thai food. The previous place was okay, but had small portions and service so bad we could not eat there. So we popped in last night (a Monday) for dinner. There has been no improvement to the service. It is a small establishment with one server. The problem is the size probably doesn't warrant two but when over half full can't be managed by one. The second most serious issue was the spice or hotness level of the food. We ordered  3, 5 and 6 level dishes, none were edible. I am Asian and like spicy food. I easily order a 6-8 and am happy. We noticed the group next to us had not eaten their dish and it was the same issue, too spicy. The women had actually ordered no spice do to allergies and it was spicy.

If you have a lot of time to sit around you could go and order a 0 or 1 and take your luck with what your going to get. I'm just gonna have to drive down to Nicky's for the excellent Thai they serve."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Thai food I've had in the area. Their crab wontons have a yellow color to them which makes me think they've added a curry. The flavor is insanely good. I also have tried the tempura eggplant which was very good, the angel in a basket which is a shrimp and cream cheese roll (excellent), pineapple fried rice, and a scallop dish. I've really had nothing bad here. They know how to cook seafood as the shrimp and scallops have never been rubbery, the tempura batter is used often, but it's not as heavy as tempura often is. The only negatives were that the portion sizes seem a bit on the small side. You don't get much rice, and it seems like you just get less than you normally would at most Asian style spots. Of course, this should be a plus as the portion they give is likely healthier than the huge amounts Americans are used to, but I'll freely admit that I love to eat. Secondly, I have been consistently disappointed at the amount of vegetables I've received. I feel like the dishes are fantastic, but I'd love to have more veggies tossed in. On a side note, the dining room is seriously small so if you want to go for dinner, I'd call to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Only reason I am not giving this five stars is because I do think it is pricey, but the food is terrific and the service is friendly.  I also like the decor -- one of the nicer Thai restaurants in the city.  They remembered us from the last time we came in, and their food is fresh and delicious.  I like it better than Nicky's Thai kitchen, personally.  We have gone several times, BUT for two people it is $50.  Lunch is a much better deal -- the usual \"get a spring roll and salad with meal\" deal that most Thai restaurants have."}
{"text":"So let me just say, if this place served alcohol I'd give it a 5-out-of-5 stars in a heartbeat. I ordered the drunken noodle with beef and it was to die for. I will order it less spicy next time, as it had me in tears, but it was so good I kept the leftovers to suffer again the following day! The atmosphere is eclectic, dark, and modern. The service is extremely fast and the quality of the ingredients is superior. Surprisingly, there are a couple tables big enough for larger parties of 6 or so, which is awesome! I love living so nearby that I can walk across our street to enjoy the Thai cuisine. I will continue to return to this restaurant and would recommend it to any Thai or Asian style cuisine fan in the Pittsburgh area! If they could get a liquor license, having a few beers here after a meal would be a delight."}
{"text":"I went here once with a friend about a month ago and loved it. Reasonable prices and delicious food. I would come back again and again to try new things on the menu. The outside of the place doesn't do it justice, and you can BYOB as well."}
{"text":"I always pass by while doing errands for lunch and been meaning to try. I love Thai food - especially chicken pad thai which I had to order today - take out.  The restaurant is small but quaint and charming.  The tables are more intimate rather than how the dining area used to be setup (I saw some old pictures courtesy of other yelpers).   The dining area is inviting ... makes you want to \"dine in\" with a close friend or a loved one etc.

I ordered chicken pad thai - of course and it was under $10.00!! Great price. It came with side salad and small egg roll.  The chicken was a little dry but the pad thai was fresh and very flavorful.  I like spicy food but not used to their ratings 1-5.. I played it safe and went to 4..  I could of went to 5.  

Off street parking. .. not so crowded.. 

I am looking forward to returning and sampling more of the menu and dining in of course.  Thanks Thai Tamarind!"}
{"text":"Thai Tamarind is a great local place to get some consistently good food. They are extremely generous with their portions, and I've yet to have a bad experience there. Dining in is a very small and intimate environment. I always get takeout, and it's a very speedy and easy process. The lunch specials are also very nice. A spring roll and a small salad along with a slightly smaller portion of the main entree at a very appealing price. The spicy scale is from 1-5, be careful with a 5 though, they don't mess around with their spice. Great little place to try though!"}
{"text":"amazing red curry.  the chicken satay and spring rolls were delish.    a must stop. i definately will be back to try more on the menu.  the shrimo pad thai on a spicy scale of 3 was perfect.  3 appetizers and 2 dinners were only 50.00 total"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small but clean and nicely decorated. The food is fresh and very tasty. I ordered the fried rice for lunch and added Basil and shrimp. The rice was very flavorful and the peppers and onions were well cooked without being mushy.  The rice came with a small salad and a fried spring roll. The ginger dressing was freshly made and the spring roll was crispy and flakey.
I would definitely eat here again,  the food is great, the prices are fair and the staff is friendly. 
Thai Tamarind is hands down the best Asian food in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a cold, rainy weeknight. There were three small parking spots directly in front of the restaurant, however, street parking was the best option. We made our way inside and found we were to seat ourselves. A waitress was quick to acknowledge us and take our drink orders. Both of us had a cup of hot tea that came served in a personal tea pot. I have little familiarity with Thai food, however, after reading the descriptions on the menu, I had trouble narrowing down what I wanted to order! I settled on the Thai Fried Rice - egg, broccoli, carrot, peas, and onion. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish and due to the large portion size, was able to take over half of it home for another meal later on in the week. 

The prices at this small, quaint restaurant are reasonable for the amount and quality of food you receive. I loved the authentic decor, with orchids lining the window sills. It is a BYOB establishment, so keep that in mind when considering coming here! Our waitress was always ready to refill our water glasses and came to check on us when she was not busy with other guests.Tasty food, caring employees, and unique decor - I recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Quick and amazing service, always delicious food and great prices. One of the best Thai places in the city. The decor is cozy and clean, and the outside patio is a great place to spend an evening of grub and conversation."}
{"text":"April 5, 2018
Has anyone been to Thai Tamarind in Bellevue recently? We don't know what happened. Is in under new ownership? All the food was inedible. They charged $.75 each can beer for a corkage fee and $1.50 each for a mini personal size bottle of wine (screw top)."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and I have to give it 5 stars , but when I order take out its a different story.  I ordered the spice level at a 5 and it was so mild I could have served it to a baby.  I think it's probably because most people don't like or want the spice.  But when someone requests 5 out of 5 for the highest.  Don't be afraid to make it spicy.  
Other than that.  The food is always perfect.  I hate bringing my rating down but when you look forward to sweating and getting a fire mouth and you don't get it. It makes me sad."}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to lunch spot - the food is consistently amazing! 
The Amazing Land with tofu is vegan AND SO FREAKING GOOD. Also the portion sizes are perfect and the atmosphere is cozy. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The food was consistently good, though that makes me want larger portions than they serve here.   The place is very small, and me and my guest are usually the only people or one of the only other tables being dined on, so it's not ever crowded when I've been. Lunch prices are SO much cheaper than dinner prices. I think lunch ends at 3pm on the menu. 
The service is okay, just a bit awkward. The lady who brought us stuff tried to upswell us on appetizers, and seemed strangely stiff when refilling our waters. Taking away our little appetizer plates when we didn't order any like she was grumpy about it. 

The atmosphere is interesting.  On the window, there is a decal that says \"voted cool space 2007\". There are plants inside and outside. There is indoor and outdoor seating, but we chose inside because it was very air conditioned. There are xmas color / themed decorations up in July. 

The Thai iced tea is actually very good and strong here!  I recommend it. Usually other places make it too sweet. The pork pad see ew and chicken pad Thai are my favorite dishes and this place does them very well. Their spiciness ratings are 1-5. I got mine at a 2, but I wish I had done 3. Still, it had a nice hint of heat in there.

This is not the best Thai place in Pittsburgh, but it's good enough!  Go here if you want a quiet place to talk, a casual romantic date, or don't mind the higher dinner prices."}
{"text":"Super excellent food. Very fresh and nicely cut vegetables. Even a simple salad taste so good. Nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is incredible. I think we've tried every curry dish at this point. Spring rolls are always fresh. Plus they have delivery now which makes for an awesome meal on a lazy night. The prices are a little higher, but you definitely get what you pay for here. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I have such a hard time finding a restaurant that serves duck, and was so happy to find it on the menu here. It was perfectly done and served in a delicious broth. The atmosphere was definitely romantic and intimate and the service was superior. 

I will absolutely be coming back here to try out some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Food is great, super close to wear I live and we get it as a treat every now and again. Don't really have anything bad to say."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Thai Tamarind twice in the past year and have enjoyed it both times. I appreciate plenty of vegetarian options, the staff is accommodating, and the bathroom is clean. I think they do a particularly good job of making the dish to match your requested level of spiciness. Yum!"}
{"text":"My 1st Thai food experience.  We did take out. The restaurant was cute and has a little outdoor sitting. Our food was done quickly and the staff was very friendly.  I had the pineapple friend rice and my husband had the crab fried rice.  I really enjoyed the pineapple and would get it again.   My husband has had Thai food before but said he liked his crab fried rice the best.    The best part was we had plenty for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Seriously Good Thai Noms...

Stopped in for take out one afternoon, to try it out...Ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp and Tom Kha Gai, as I have found them to be good tests of a Thai kitchen's capabilities.
The soup was wonderful, not firey, but plenty of flavor, with lots of straw mushrooms, chicken and herbs.  The inclusion of fresh tomato was a nice plus.

The Pad Thai was fantastic...lots of big plump shrimp, good sauce, nice veggies, beautifully arranged even in a take out container....in fact, had they but included a wedge of lime to squeeze over it, it would have been utter perfection.

A definite plus is that both dishes were cooked and ready to go in just 5 minutes!

The dining room is still as lovely as it was in the previous incarnation, but the lower prices and larger servings are a major plus.  The outside seating area is very nice.

I will DEFINITELY be visiting here again, often!

(I just wish they delivered)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We have both been to Thai Tamarind before but it had been a long time since our last visit.  The inside of Thai Tamarind is modestly decorated with a bunch of different table sizes/shapes throughout on either side of the restaurant.

For dinner on this evening I decided on the crispy duck, max spiciness, while my wife went with her usual pad Thai.  After only a somewhat short wait our dinners were out on the table.  The crispy duck was described as being in a red curry sauce with tomato, bell pepper, pineapple and lychee.  My duck was as described and plenty crispy on the outside but also fatty at times which duck can often be.  What I didn't care for was whenever a piece ended up in the red curry for over a minute as the once crispy duck became soggy.  As for the curry itself it was certainly flavorful and had a little bit of heat to it, I only wish that it had a little more.

The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  I have enjoyed the food at Thai Tamarind each time that I have visited so why not?"}
{"text":"Another nice dinner at this pretty restaurant with good food. Nadia and Three took good care of us as we take our time with 3 courses. Everything was good and authentic.  Byob is a plus. They were owners of McKnight Kitchen also but are now just concentrating on Bellevue with continued  good results. They were busy on a Fri night so make a reservation but after about 7:30 some walkins got tables. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night with a friend. I absolutely loved everything about the place. It's a perfectly hidden gem in Bellevue. The decor and atmosphere are exactly what I love and our service was quick and super friendly. I feel like this would be a really great date spot.  The only thing that bothered me is the temperature. It was very cold inside and both my friend and I left our coats on most of the time, which made eating a little uncomfortable.

I ordered the Tom Yum Soup at a spicy 1 with vegetables. It was fantastic. I also ordered the Rad Nah at a spicy 2, with vegetables and tofu. The meal had an amazing and delicious flavor, but this felt more like a spicy 6/7 and caused my nose to run the whole time and mouth to stop tasting the wonderful flavor of the dish. However, that didn't stop me from eating more than I should.

I would have loved to try a dessert, but I was just too full.  The portions were quite sufficient in my opinion, and I was lucky enough to take leftovers home. 

I absolutely will be back and I also look forward to visiting when the weather warms and we can dine outside. I really hope this restaurant does well."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. Love the decor and the general feel. Service was awesome, employees were very polite. Their food was great, soup/salad, apps, entrees... everything was wonderful. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot. Curries are well balanced, noodle dishes are solid, and spice levels are spot on."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so cozy and the staff is exceptionally friendly. I have tried multiple items on the menu and have loved every one."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Thai Tamarind twice now. Everything we've gotten has been really good. I highly recommend getting the fish volcano. It's tempura tilapia with a mixture of veggies and rice in a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. The fish is nice and crispy and the sauce is delicious! 
Service has been great and the food comes out quick. My only complaint is the lighting is really weird. (Which is why the photos are a little off.) Not sure if they are using fluorescent bulbs but the lighting messes with my eyes and gives me a slight headache. 
But regardless the food is really good so I'll continue to eat there."}
{"text":"After my first review under new ownership I went back and decided to change my review. The food was definitely improved over my last visit. The service is quick and the portions are very gracious. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"First I went to Thai Orchid. There I asked for Pineapple Fried Rice served in the pineapple. All they said was Thai Tamarind. So I came here. And boy am I glad I did. Unfortunately that day they did not have fresh pineapples to serve but the fried rice was delicious. Very authentic. They even had Prik Nuu which is a hot pepper mix that I learned about in Thailand and hardly find it here in the US. Unfortunately I live too far from Pittsburgh but I'm for sure going back here when I'm in town again. And thanks for the great service. The donut dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice inside. The outside is adorable as well. There are tables and chairs set up outside. It's a very nice plants surrounding the tables. The servers are very knowledgeable, and pleasant. I got the broccoli and peanut sauce. It was a little too sweet for me, but it was good. Husband ordered A noodle dish. Both dishes were OK, I'm spoiled and I was looking for a pumpkin or squash curry dish. The spring  rolls are delicious and fresh. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has had it's ups and downs since the new ownership, but lately it has been fantastic.  Best Thai curry that I have tasted in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"Checked to see if it was open and when we arrived it was closed.  Apparently this restaurant will close at random. Really can't say if the food is good."}
{"text":"I think I'm spoiled... Between Nicky's and Smiling Banana Leaf, I had very high expectations coming here given the recs from friends.  Was I disappointed? No.  Was I underwhelmed? Yes.  

I think the ambiance is great- perfect for a date.  The servers were nice, but I do admit feeling quite rushed.  The food was good- but not the same quality that I'm used to.  I don't think it was bad at all, I just felt like some of the flavors were missing.  I ordered the same things I often get at other places to offer a true comparison even, so I do feel like I'm being more than fair in my assessment. 

It is BYOB which is nice, and I'm sure this location is great for people who don't want to cruise on down toward the city to go to other places.  It's just not a place that I desire returning to.  It just didn't have that oomph factor I need to want to come back."}
{"text":"Nice food...was a relaxed sat noon wth only 3 tables occupied and 1 server. Wonder if they have more servers at rush!! Food was nice, cooked wth care. Surely worth a try. Parking may be a pain on rush day...

Liked the garlic salad as compliment, that was different!!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good authentic Thai place and I think we found it.  The atmosphere was nice and relaxing and the service was great. The food was obviously very good as well. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because there was no air conditioning and it was very warm inside as the sun was setting. We will definitely make the drive back."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! I went twice this week for lunch. Tons of lunch specials, great prices and lunch come w soup or salad and a spring roll. Service is very fast so you can go on your lunch break. I ordered the pad kee mao w tofu and pad Thai with chicken. Both were yummy but the pad Thai was a little sweet. You order on a spice scale of 1-5. I got a 3 but will probably order a 4 next time."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy! I love too that they have lunch specials on the weekends. The chrysanthemum tea is AMAZING!! The service and prices are great too!"}
{"text":"The soft shell crab wrap may be the most delicious thing I have eaten in a long time. I eat a lot of soft shell crab. This presentation was exceptional. Tasted too good. Way better than any soft shell sushi. Service was great and fast. I will be back soon to try the duck curry. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there one time and I will be back.  Food was delicious.  Also, they have a chrysanthemum tea that is awesome.  We stuck with the national dish of Pad Thai.  I had chicken in mine and my Mom had vegetables . We both enjoyed our Pad Thai.  We also had Tom Yum soup and egg rolls.  As stated our meal was delicious. The only complaint (if you want to call it that), was it was very difficult to understand the servers . We had a hard time asking them about some of the dishes (which is why we stuck with the Pad Thai).  A customer did come into the restaurant to pick up a to go  order, and she was immensely helpful in explaining some of the dishes. She highly recommended the curry dishes, which we will try next time. All in All, this is an awesome restuarant"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We did have to alert someone that we were seated and waiting to be waited on but other than that I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in the area.  Great service and byob. Not sure if it is authentic enough for \"foodies\", and they serve a not so great orange chicken but you shouldnt order Chinese at a Thai place anyway.  Order the pad see ew or prag king, or pineapple curry, you won't be disappointed.  Spiciness is middle of the road so don't be scared to go with 5/5. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is always good. The food is so fresh it comes out piping hot. The ambiance is relaxing and cozy. Coming here for a big plate of noodles is a great way to wind down after a busy day at the office. 

I know it's nit picking to say this, but the only thing I don't like is the parking situation, you might have to go around the block and park on the street if it's busy. But it is way better than going somewhere downtown and having to pay for parking that isn't even close to where you want to go. 

Definitely a gem, we will continue to patron this lovely establishment."}
{"text":"I love Thai Thamarind. I think it's the best thai food in Pittsburgh-yes beating out Nicky's. The food gets 5 stars, easily-fresh ingredients, spiced as requested, and very flavorful. 

(The one-star reduction is because sometimes I'll call, wanting to place an order for takeout, and no one picks up. I don't know if they are ignoring the phone or if their hours aren't actually accurate or consistent, but it's happened a few times.)

It's too good to give up on, but I am sad the times I have to end up eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband, teenage daughter and I rented an apartment across the street for a short stay in Pittsburgh and decided to venture over to Thai Tamarind for dinner. we had two appetizers and two entrees, which were all excellent. Great flavors and very fresh tasting ingredients. Prices were reasonable, service was good and nice ambiance.  I was surprised it was not more crowded for a Friday night. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for dinner on a Thursday night. We hadn't eaten Thai in a while and wanted to mix it up. Arriving around 6 PM and parking on the street up the road, the restaurant it wasn't too crowded inside and we sat ourselves at a table near the front. Even though the whole front were glass windows it was still fairly warm inside.  As the night continued on, a steady stream of people came in for both a sit down dinner and take out.

My wife and I both ordered tea. She had the lemon ginger and I had the Jasmine. We each were given our own personal pot with sugar and a cup. I was very happy with my tea having never tried Jasmine before! For dinner, I ended up ordering the hot basil fried rice with chicken with a spice level of 4 out of 5. The portion sizes are HUGE, but the spiciness was not up to par. Regardless the food was good and the waitress did a wonderful job keeping up with all the tables despite being the only wait staff there. 

I really like the portion sizes and the menu itself has a plethora of items I would love to try. Being BYOB is a plus, I just wish this place was closer to where we lived. Nicky's is my favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh, but this place is in the same ballpark for both quality and price!"}
{"text":"Food is so good and conveniently located for our house! We take out from here frequently. The ambiance in the dining room is warm, cozy and inviting if you'd prefer to dine in!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, any Thai Restaurant that serves not only over cooked rice, but mushy noodles too???

Obviously there has been a change in ownership since the last time I was here. 

Can't hold a soggy noodle to Nicky 's. Not in a million years. 

Worst part was the .75 cents per can and the $1.50 per single serve wine bottle that we brought and consumed there. Never again. My can of American Light didn't even cost .75 cents each 

There should be a zero star option on here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic atmosphere, fantastic service. One of my favorite places to dine in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"Wow-I must say, what an improvement over what used to be in this spot, Thai Suan Thip! I have lived just down the street from this place for nearly three years, and I had such a bad experience at its predecessor I never had the desire to return even though I had heard it changed ownership. Well last night my date, who spent all day on the road driving back from DC, arrived at my place famished, so he (yes, he's learned well from me haha) quickly did a Yelp search of what was still open nearby, and although I was hesitant, I had been wanting to try Thai Tamarind since I drive by it so often , so we set off on the long drive (approx. 3 minutes give or take) there, and promptly found parking right out front. There were already a few other tables in there so my first thought was \"well, at least it's not completely empty-maybe that's a good sign\", but as we approached the door, I noticed the posted hours differed from both Yelp and the Thai Tamarind website, which was a bit confusing. The posted hours on the door said until 9:30pm, yelp listed 10:00pm, and their own website listed 10:30 pm! So, just a suggestion to Thai Tamarind, you should probably make sure all times are uniform across all the various postings. Even though we came in at 9:00, we were greeted very quickly with waters and menus. The menu is pretty extensive but still typical for a Thai restaurant. After scanning the menu, my date decided on pad Thai with chicken at a 6 level (scale 1-10) and I went with the Wild Curry with chicken (which had bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, carrots, celery, and mushrooms) at a 5 level. By the time we ordered we were the only diners in the restaurant, so our food came out very quickly. My curry was pretty good-flavorful without being overly spicy but just enough kick to it for me. My date seemed to enjoy his pad Thai (although he did say he just had Thai in DC that was really good so maybe this wasn't as good?)  as well since he finished the whole plate but at the same time he said it was all he had to eat that day and it was 9:00pm. I took a forkful though and I thought it was pretty good-better than Thai Place but not as good as Nicky's. I liked how it wasn't as dry as some of the Pad Thai entrees I have had elsewhere. Even though we came in near closing, we were never rushed and our server said more than once to take our time. It is BYOB but he still had another 2 hours to drive back home so maybe next time! I did notice corkage is pretty minimal which is nice. They also seem to do a nice takeout business since as we were eating 4 different people came in to pick up to go orders and we were in there for probably about 45 minutes total. I will be back, particularly since this is (currently) right down the street from me and it is a nice walk in the summertime-possibly bringing a bottle of wine with me next time!"}
{"text":"First time here. Looks like an antique store from the outside ;) Nice seating arrangement, fantastic service, the food was great. I got the Dumplings, which were delicious, though a little pricey. Main dish was Choo Chee, seafood. Really great. I will be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The atmosphere is intimate but not necessarily romantic. The decorations are really cool and the staff is friendly. The food is just amazing! Prices are reasonable and I've never waited more than 20 min for food whether it be in the restaurant or for pickup. Highly recommend this hidden treasure"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the North Hills. Absolutely amazing, have tried many dishes and appetizers, and not once been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh... Small place with less than 10 tables ... Great atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, very flavorful and they spice your food to your taste. Have had the pad Thai and the hurricane scallops. The hurricane scallops came with 6-7 large seared scallops and steamed vegetables with the hurricane sauce on the side. Flavors were great and I would recommend both that and there pad Thai. Pad Thai was also perfectly spiced and tasted amazing. If you haven't dined here before give it try you would regret it!"}
{"text":"Moving to Bellevue recently, this has become my go-to for Thai. Which is my favorite. I haven't tried too much on the menu yet, but the pad Thai is good and I love their ginger dressing."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city. The food is amazing and vegan friendly. I highly recommend the Pad See Ew with tofu. The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic. We passed this place after looking at what would become our new home and have been walking the three blocks from our place to Thai Tamarind ever since."}
{"text":"NEW MANAGEMENT IS AWESOME!! I went here a couple days ago with some friends and the food was amazing! My favorite was the Crab Rangoon! I also really liked the crab wrap and sweet and sour chicken! My friends had the spring rolls and duck and said it was phenomenal. It's also BYOB, which is a huge plus, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Bellevue now for almost 2 years and have always wanted to check this place out. I finally went there yesterday and I can't believe I waited so long to try it out. This place is so cute inside. I ordered the spicy ramen and it was a great portion, great price and very tasty. Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Ended up trying this because of a coupon, but it was so great and exceeded our expectations.  Love the small, cute atmosphere,  BYOB ( obviously love) everything we tried was on point (green curry, summer rolls, bang bang shrimp, and Pad Kee Mao), reasonably priced and large portions, Can't wait to go back and try something else ( large menu) Seriously big fan."}
{"text":"Went for my first time on Saturday. I had the beef and broccoli in brown sauce. I was great. The sauce was flavorful and the broccoli was fresh and crispy. 

Reasonably prices and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"So I'd gone to this restaurant in its former incarnation, and gave it a low star review mostly due to overpricing and toy portions. Even though the food had been decent, there just wasn't enough of it, and the price certainly didn't match the size of the meal. After my last review, apparently, the business had changed hands, and I received a very nice comment saying 'come back, new owners, better portions, different prices. 

So this past weekend, after moving furniture to my new house in Bellevue, I decided to give it another try. After all, the new management reached out, and I haven't had much to write about lately.

I have to say, they did not disappoint. I was exhausted and hungry, so I didn't go crazy trying menu items, but just went with the tried and true Pad Thai, and a Diet Coke. My friend had some kind of shrimp and vegetable dish with rice and a Thai iced tea. 

The Pad Thai was basic, all the right stuff was in there. I ordered the 8 on their spice level (1-10) and clearly could have gone all the way to ten. The portion was plentiful, and for 'dinner', the price of $12.50 didn't make me cringe too much. I still find that a little steep for a plate of noodles with chicken and nothing on the 'side', but it wasn't bank-breaking for two. 

Sadly, we were the only people there for our entire meal. The server was very sweet and helpful, but I wasn't quite sure she understood all that we said.  The 'atmosphere' (which doesn't really phase me when looking for 'food'), is still the same as it was under the last ownership. It's comfortable and attractive, without being pretentious. I do feel that, considering the area that they're in, if they dropped the prices just slightly, they'd have a bigger crowd. 

All in all, it was worth the return trip to check it out, but again, I don't know how 'regular' I'd be when other options like Spice Island Tea House is still around, still reasonable, and excellent. I've been to Spice Island treating a party of three, and WITH appetizers, three entrees and soft drinks, the bill was less than for ONLY two entrees and two soft drinks at Thai Tamarind. BUT, this IS still a price improvement over the past owners.

But four stars it is, for an improvement in portions, a comfortable setting and helpful service."}
{"text":"Always our favorite.  Kind service.  They always are overly friendly to our children.  The food is wonderful and nice relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Went here recently and really enjoyed the food and the ambience.  We got a couple appetizers - including their summer roll and pot stickers.  Both of these are a favorite of mine at any Thai restaurant, and Thai Tamarind didn't disappoint.  Everyone I was with thoroughly enjoyed their main course, which ranged from Pad Thai to the Chicken Volcano.  I've always been a fan of Nicky's, but will definitely not hesitate to stop at Thai Tamarind instead, especially since I can walk there."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch.  I ordered chicken satay, chicken with rice soup and pad thai with chicken and shrimp. I also had one glass of thai iced tea. 

Stating with the drink. The iced tea was really good. Although I've never had bad thai iced tea.  The chicken satay was fine. Nothing special but good enough. The chicken with rice soup was good. It's always kinda bland but it was ok. 

The pad thai was very average.  It had a sort of smelly feet stink to it that was a little off putting.  I noticed the whole place was just a little stinky.  The chicken was a little chewy and the shrimp a little fishy.   All in all I probably won't return.  The service was quick and the staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre. My mom and I ordered takeout for dinner. I got the chicken panang curry spicy level 4 and that was ok, although, for $13, I expected a larger portion and more rice. My mom got the Tom Yum soup with chicken and spicy level 2. She said it was definitely much spicier than a 2. Also, I should have checked the takeout bag before I left the restaurant because they gave us the appetizer size of the soup rather than the entree size. Overall, it just wasn't great when there are other fantastic thai places within a 5mile radius."}
{"text":"Very nice!  I'm visiting Pittsburgh from Southern California and happened in on the gem because it was close to my son's house.
I eat seafood (no other meat) so I can only vouch for the seafood dishes.
I've been here twice in three days and everything has been delicious and fresh.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff very friendly.
I will return before my vacation is over!"}
{"text":"Good spot.  As good as any Thai food I have had.  Great lunch portion.  Nice staff.  Nice interior.  I would recommend trying it out.  Hot basil us very good."}
{"text":"Seriously the best dishes ever!! I'll be back again and again

Summer & Autumn rolls were delicious and the Special Island dish was so fantastic I wanted to lick my plate. 

FYI... BYOB with a corkage fee"}
{"text":"I always like to give places another chance, and I love Thai food, so when my boyfriend suggested that we eat here rather than getting take-out from Nicky's I agreed, and I was delighted that the food was much better than the previous time when I got take out just after the new management took over.  We got the veggie fresh rolls and crab rangoon for appetizers both of which were delicious, though I felt that the portion for the fresh rolls was rather small - it was basically one fresh roll that was cut into 2 pieces, but the flavors were bright and crisp, and the crab rangoon was creamy with the perfect amount of saltiness.  

For entrees we decided to share the chicken noodle bowl and the Massaman curry with beef.  The chicken noodle bowl was hands down amazing!  It was a large portion with long, perfectly cooked rice noodles with generous amounts of tender chicken.  That alone was actually enough to satisfy my appetite after the appetizers, so I only had a small taste of the curry, which was rich and flavorful with perfectly balanced spices but the beef was just a tad tough.  Overall, this was a vast improvement over the take out that I got on my previous visit, so I wanted to be sure to bump up my review and give them a fair assessment after my most recent visit.  I will definitely be back/get take out from here in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Everything here is delicious! You must try the crab Rangoons, rice soup and mango curry!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service but food quite ordinary.  Did not enjoy the food except sou p which was okay"}
{"text":"I hesitantly give this place a 5. This is because it's so good, I don't want the secret out, but have to give credit when due. I love the hot sauce rack we got and the Red seafood curry was quite tasty. The tom yum soup was great"}
