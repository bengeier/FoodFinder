{"text":"We ordered there the other night  for the first and surely the LAST TIME. We were looking to eat a comfort tonkinoise soup on a lazy Monday night, but what we received was really disappointing! First, the delivery took so long that I had to call back to ask if they forgot. The soup came cold and the noodles saggy. I had the beef tonkinoise and the amount of beef was ridiculous among the pile of overcooked noodles.Usually, asian restaurant are very generous on vegetables to make your plate look full and bigger. NOT them!! Al there was in my soup was a few slices of raw oignons and a few leaves of coriander, nothing else not even a slice of lime. I added brocoli and green oinions myself. My GF had the Chicken/Shrimps Tum-Yum soup and that was the worst soup she ever had to digest...actually she didn't digest it at all because the shrimp were not fresh at all and she got sick. It gaves her cramps, allergic reactions and she threw it all up. In the end she spend more time being sick in the toilet than eating that goddam shitty soup. Wok Supreme: Never EVER again! Not kidding: ever the fortune cookies tasted like they were made in 1950!"}

{"text":"Never Again. The only good thing I have to say about WOK Supreme, is the delivery was incredibly fast. Don't be fooled by the cheap price, when your most likely going to toss it all in the trash.  I ordered Combo 1 for about $25 for 2 people. Fair Price.   The egg rolls tasted almost rotten. The Wongton Soup was as soggy as soggy can be, and I am not sure what kind of meat was in it - bad. The spareribs were good though. The pineapple chicken and rice were edible.   I try not to be too picky, but I have tried dozens of other places around Montreal - this is officially the all time worst place to order from."}
