{"text":"How have I not written a review for this restaurant yet!?
Can't go here & not have the ribs & baked potato soup!!! Yummmm!
Fairly good service, good prices & parking & location.
It's a ribs & soup restaurant, nothing too fancy but can't get bad ribs here.
Have always enjoyed going here."}
{"text":"Came here for the steak and lobster special. There was a line for it. Waited about one hour to get in, took less than 10 minutes to finish the steak and lobster, maybe less than 10 mins. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Many come here for that. However, they'll turn people away close to 11."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and was able too get in without a wait. I ordered the St. Louis ribs full slab with fries.

Every year I go to Kansas City just too eat ribs. Flavor was good but not impressive."}
{"text":"We went there for the 11.99 steak and lobster special.  There was quite a line. and we hoped that the popularity of the place was indicative of good food.  

We were wrong.  The \"steak\" portion consisted of a small, unidentifiable cut off beef with ac strange flavor.    The lobster tail looked dry and had an awful appearance and texture.  It didn't tastequite  as bad as it looked though, but I would still characterize it as mediocre at best.  The mixed vegetables appeared to be out of a can.

Even though the price is low, the special is totally not worth it.  It is nothing but small portions of bad food, and you have to wait a long time in line just to eat that garbage.  The only positive about the entire meal was that the cocktails from the bar were pretty good.

Avoid the steak and lobster special at all costs."}
{"text":"We've always loved Tony Romas! We always look foward to coming here every vegas trip. I get the half rack bbq baby back ribs. The half rack seemed same size as the full rack, unless they accidentally gave me a full rack. :/. Make sure when you order the corn on the cob you get 2 orders cause just one corn is a half of the long one, quite small, but the ribs are bomb! Soft off the bone but yet grilled perfectly burnt! How I like it!  The broccoli was hard and cold upon arrival. All in all still same great taste!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had.  Family and friends decided to go for ribs at Tony Roma's around 7pm. One of the meals ordered was the prime rib Roma size which was requested to come out as medium rare to rare.   The prime rib came out as well done and when brought to the waiter's attention,  we were told that the prime rib had been cooking since 4pm and prime rib does not come out medium rare. The waiter became defensive when the feedback was given.   The manager then came and also refused to acknowledge the mistake or apologize.  We will never eat here again due to the poor food quality and poor managerial service.   Beware of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've driven past Tony Roma's many times but never thought to give it a chance.  I got an email from travelzoo for a $39 three course meal for two so I decided to check it out.  I must say I was quite pleased and I will be returning (& paying full price!!).

It was four of us who went so we ordered quite a large amount of food.  We had the appitizer sampler to start with. It was gooooood, but lacked flavor.  My husband and I each had a white sangria and it was great as well.  

For entrees we had Ribs, the little filet things (I don't remember what they are called), half bbq chicken, a chicken salad, and shrimp scampi (I think that was everything) along with many sides! Everything was very very good.  The restaurant wasn't too busy at the hour that we went, so I think we lucked out there!  The meats were very tender and juicy.

We all also shared the dessert trio...and O M G! I was expecting the desserts to be tiny but they weren't.  It was even hard for all four of us to eat all this food.

The service was okay.  It wasn't over the top phenomenal and it didn't suck... but I saw every other table got bread with their meal.  Is that something that comes with a certain meal?  Not that I could have eaten it anyway, just curious.

I liked it!"}
{"text":"The 11.99 steak and lobster is a great price... Service horrible and management is not real management. Would not do seperate checks..got the bill and it was not itemized the fountain drinks and alcohol all together in one..we had a party of about 20,everybody had different drinks of course, I will never eat at any tony romas again.."}
{"text":"If I could I would give 0 stars. This place is trash !!! Everything looks over overbooked and there is barely anything to choose from. Pls do your self a favor don't goto this place !"}
{"text":"Sadly this time was really disappointing. The steak was like eating an old hiking boot. It was so over cooked it was ridiculous. 
Honestly, if I'd wanted something cooked that badly, I'd have cooked it myself
Normally good. This time really a let down"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was given a number like at a meat deli. Not a pager, not a phone call or text. Then since when we walked in we could hear numbers being called out thought we would hear them call us on the casino floor, Wrong! We were given #60. Didn't hear them call a number for 30 mins. Then went back and were told out number was called then past. We ended up taking another number #8 and waiting another 30-45 mins. Food was ok at best. Better to just go to Costco and make them yourself. Go check out my photo of the bucket of empty Promises. Lol! This place is a joke for the money you could spend at a better more professional place."}
{"text":"Good solid food- I always feel satisfied after a dinner at TRs.  This location is a good size and feels clean and the service is good.  I would recommend this location to my friends."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant during lunch hours and received the worst service. Our server got all four orders incorrect. The filet medallions were either bloody rare or dry well done when asked to be cooked as medium. The fries were rock hard and inedible. Our drinks were not refilled during our entire luncheon.  The server was rude when I requested another steak that was cooked appropriately. He disappeared for 45minutes and sent the hostess to tend to our requests. I placed a to-go order at the same time we got our meals and when the to-go order came out I informed the server that the side salad was missing. He did not acknowledge what I said instead turned around in a rush to head back to his beloved kitchen cave. I must say I am not a restaurant diva by any means but when the service is this ridiculous a yelp review needs to be done :)"}
{"text":"I ordered online and was charged almost $40 and received only two items out of 6 that I ordered. Then was told by the delivery driver that there was nothing he could do. Once I asked him to call and please fix this, he told me that I had to wait for another delivery then he would come back to me. I'll never order online again because I do actually like the food... It was just unfortunate and irritating to be charged for something and not receive it."}
{"text":"Good Ribs - 5 Star (very generous here)
Terrible servce - -1 Star
Terrible steak (dry and flavorles)- -1 Star
Terrible appetizer- -1 Star

Get the picture?  If only you can get the ribs without anything else.  Avoid this place unless you have no choice."}
{"text":"Very good food for a reasonable price. The steak dinner was great and it cost less than to eat a burger and fries on the strip."}
{"text":"We've been regular customers at this location for over 10 years but last nights exp was probably our last. Our dissatisfaction came over a $2 charge which is unfortunate but was enough to help us realize that we were only coming back out of habit."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere, yummy food and very attentive service. Really good salmon, artichoke dip, and Carolina honey wings. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The restraunt look busy, so we assumed good food.

 The hostess was incredibly rude she never smiled or not to mention no eye contact, she told us it would be about 20 minutes, so we went to the bar ordered a few beers and as we were paying for are drinks she yelled last call ticket 32 when she called it one time only.

The beverage boy was quick brought us water and bread, the waitress not so quick she passed us a few times told us she would be right there. She finally got to us and said what do you want to eat that simple no hello or my name is, 
We ordered ribs and chips I give the the food a 5 star the meat fell off the bones, as for the waitress never came back to check on us,  but that's probably because this restaurant is under staffed it's a jungle in there we probably won't go back do to the service.

{"text":"Oct.2015, we went there with the whole family, I was surprise that the food and services was
so good. They have a good  menu for the kids and  adults, the price is right, so we will be
back."}
{"text":"First time here with friends,  everyone got the prime rib so I did also. Ordered medium rare. It showed up well done and was the toughest piece of prime I've ever had. Couldn't eat it, but took home for doggies.  Can't speak to the rest of the menu but you may want to skip the prime."}
{"text":"For a big name like Tony Romas... I was hoping for a nice size, seasoned steak, at a reasonable price. I wasn't expecting mortons quality, but I was expecting that chain flavor, at least... tasteful...

I got the sirloin... and it was horrible. I should have told my server I wasn't happy, but my expectations were the same for the ribeye... unflavored, and unseasoned. It was simply a bummer and I sucked it up and went to a better steakhouse, the following night... 

Don't eat here if your looking for a DECENT steak. $20/person for a soda and a piece of rubber... 

We should've just went to outback or a better chain..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least four times now. (once every month) I've had good experiences all four times that I've gone. I do however go during lunch time when they aren't as busy. We also go when we get their buy one entree get one free coupon in the mail. It's an awesome deal! 

They have a huge variety on both their drink and food menu. I will say that I think they have the best steaks compare to Applebee's and Chilli's. Their steaks are super tender and the server always ask you to cut your steak to make sure its cook the way you asked."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty decent..the food is good the service was delightful i would recommend it..at least to try anyways."}
{"text":"We went to Tony Roma's yesterday as a party of three...BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! Given that it was Thanksgiving Monday, we were their first diners of the day as they opened t 3..Very attentive server...he was the ONLY one there! We ordered Appetizers [Full order of Onion Loaf and Potato skins] - both were good. The Main course on the other had was just BAD!!!! We ordered 2 Ribs and BBQ chicken combos and the Beef Short Rib...I specifically requested the Hot Sauce but didn't get it..the ribs were tough and not \"fall off the bone\" as we've had before...the chicken was not thoroughly cooked...the food actually looked as if it had been just reheated and served. Sides were french fries and coleslaw....they were actually the best part of the meal...VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! Will not be going there or any other location EVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Tony Romas at Crowfoot on Saturday evening. There was no wait to get seated. 
Two of the group had the half rack of ribs and I had the Filet Mignon. 
The food was good, although for steak I personally prefer The Keg ....... and judging by the que for getting in, so did many others. 
My only real gripe was the lack of attention to the coctails. They were pictured with frosted rim, cherry and slice of lemon. 
Turned up with non of the above, just looked bland and unimaginative. 
I'm a firm believer of \"if a jobs worth doing, it's worth doing well\"
The other thing I didn't like was the coleslaw ..........  It had celery in it.  YAK!
But that's just personally me and no reflection on the quality of the food. 
I will go back, but only after trying many other places first."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a tony romas, and they sure made a bad impression on me. I ordered the st Louis ribs and chicken fingers. The chicken tasted dry.and generic, Like something  that you get from Albertsons freezer, and the ribs was just ok.( if you want some bomb ass ribs go to famous daves) the loaded baked potato was also tasteless and generic.
I was really dissatisfied and won't return to any location.
Do not waste your taste buds and money here! Not recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to tony Roma's looking for some good BBQ and ribs, but did not even have the opportunity to order our food. We were seated and told our waitress would be right with us. After 15 minutes of being ignored, with guests who arrived after us being seen to first, we decided that this was not the place for us to eat. The poor service and blatant disrespect we received that night was enough for us to never support this business again."}
{"text":"Just meh. We sat in the lounge, thinking the service would be quicker. Not so much. My salad was more lettuce with brown edges than what was actually supposed to be in there, and hubby's prime rib was not served as ordered and was cold. Disappointing all around."}
{"text":"I understand Tony Roma's is known for their ribs, but you would think chicken would go hand in hand here. It doesn't. Never order chicken from this place, it was by far the worst I've had.

I ordered a quarter chicken dinner that tasted like they had cooked it in a microwave, let it sit around for a few hours, then slapped some bland barbecue sauce on it and served it to me with dry, tasteless fries.

Terrible, terrible. Stay away from the chicken....."}
{"text":"Bugs in my salad and vomit in the bathroom urinal. After showing the manager the chef came out and half ass apologized and said he's seen worse. Clearly they have high standards..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It took a while to get our food but it was worth it! I had the chicken fingers and they were delicious! I also had their prime rib another time I went here and it was great! I love the mashed potatoes as a side. The rice is a little bland but it's still great to have with ribs or steak!"}
{"text":"We did order steak and lobster special. I wish I checked yelp first. It was the first steak ever that I did not finish. Half of it was so hard that it was impossible to cut with the knife. Vegies were frozen and tasteless. They have such a crowd of one time custommers that they don't even try. People at next table had the same problem. I was going to try prime rib special but they were out at the begining of the service.
I am not going to eat there again."}
{"text":"\"Famous For Ribs\"  Famous for what?  These were the worst ribs I have ever had!  The meat was dry and chewy.  They were also very thin.  I had the dirty rice which was ok.  The mac and cheese was tasty.  The staff was friendly.  With Memphis BBQ in town, I have no reason to return to Tony Roma's."}
{"text":"Although there are Tony Roma's restaurants all over, my first visit to one was last Monday 2/8/10.

As noted in previous reviews, the decor is nothing fancy. My group was seated in the bar section of the restaurant which has raised tables and high chairs and elevated booths along the walls. At least it wasn't all cluttered up with all the fake manufactured quirky decorations like most of these chain type places are. No suspenders an \"pieces of flair\" on the wait staff.

Even though Tony Roma's is \"Famous For Ribs\" I'm not a real rib fan, so I decided to get a steak.

I chose the 9 oz. sirloin cooked medium with a loaded baked potato and dinner salad. The table shared an onion loaf.

I was expecting an adequate meal but I have to say the food was awesome.

The dinner salad was large with mixed greens, onions, tomato, and croutons. All very fresh and tasted great. I love a good salad. Add a grilled chicken breast to it and it would be a meal in itself. 

Our salad course was also served with a loaf of fresh baked hot bread and some sort of garlic and herb compound butter which was very nice.

The onion loaf arrived next and we dug into it hard. It is addictingly good and we all enjoyed it.

The entrees arrived and my sirloin was done perfectly. I don't know what seasonings they use while grilling it but it was one of the best tasting sirloins I've ever had. I could have eaten two. The loaded potato was good but a bit cold- not even hot enough to melt the shredded cheese on top. It wasn't that big of a deal for me though as the steak was so good.

Service was excellent. Our waitress was exceedingly polite and helpful with a constant smile who really seemed to enjoy her job- rare to find here in Vegas in my experience. She even put up with the \"special order for everything\" person at our table.

Prices were really reasonable too. My sirloin with potato and salad was $15.95 which I consider a real bargain. I've paid $40-50 for lesser steaks (and that's for the steak alone) at some \"celeb chef\" restaurants in the strip casinos.

I'll definitely be a return customer here."}
{"text":"Ok food. Pleasant but basic service.  Automatic 18% tip tacked on the bill for our group of 9. I guess the server figured she didn't have to work harder for her tip. Ambience - it gets loud because sound echos off the wood panelling."}
{"text":"We Decided to have Dinner.So Me and The Wife Went Downtown  Fremont Street.The Wait was About 20Mins..But they were very Prompt,Friendly,Courteous..My Food Was Delicious! THE Steak &Lobster for $11.99 was  a Great Value..The Bacon Mac N Cheese was Out of this World..It  Tasted Like Moms Homemade Bake Mac N Cheese...Definitely Please About Our Visit. WILL return If Ever In this Neck of the Woods Again....Honeymooners...The William's."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef ribs... they were charred to death and tough as nails. I don't normally complain, but when the waitress asked how my meal was I told her \"not that good\". It took her a moment to process and then she apathetically replied, \"Would you like some new ribs\". I told her \"that would be nice\". After my wife had completely finished her meal, I got my new batch of ribs. They were still charred and less tough (though I think that was due to the grizzly fat content of the meat). I told the waitress \"the ribs are usually better here\" to which I got no response, not even a discount or a free dessert. Nope I had to pay full price. To make things worse it was my birthday and I left feeling slightly nauseated. I would give them a zero, but I don't think that's an option here. You can get better ribs almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Oh Tony Roma - what happened?? You used to be one of our very favorites but the last 3 times have been very disappointing and... sorry to say, 3 strikes and you're out. We may try other locations but the NE one will not see us and we're spreading the word. You need to get your act together!!
Our first disappointment was on my birthday visit. first of all a long wait, then my appetizer took so long to arrive that the entree was mere seconds behind and the entree was cold. We complained and they didn't charge for the appetizer so we were appeased. Visit #2 - again a long wait, cold ribs... I complained on the website but heard nothing back.
But this last visit really hit all the wrong notes. There were 4 adults at the table. None of t he entrees were hot!!! Diner #1 began with cold coffee; diner #2 asked for a baked potato with butter only and was served a lukewarm, fully dressed potato alongside warm ribs; diner #3 ordered deluxe mac'n'cheese and had never eaten anything so salty! (and shouldn't have eaten it!) That was served with warm 1/4 chicken; diner #4 picked out 1/2 of the lettuce from a salad because it was brown and wilted. She complained and but nothing was done... Her sandwich was much more focaccia than filling. She was also served the mac'n'cheese but couldn't eat it... Even the free birthday meal won't be bringing us back. So sad about that..."}
{"text":"O.M.G.  This was the WORST dinner ever!  We got lured in by the photos and pricing of the steak and lobster 'special' but this is a truly a case of getting what you pay for!  We'd been to a Tony Roma's in CA for ribs that were excellent and thought it'd at least be halfway decent but nothing could be further from the truth.  The steak was pathetically small and overcooked.  The lobster looked and tasted like it had crawled through the desert to get to the plate.  My margarita was little more than flavored water.  The only redeeming item was the rack of ribs we ordered as a side to share.  Terrible dining experience all around - don't waste your money here when there are so many fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service and staff.Attended for a birthday with a party of 12, we were aytended too quickly and effficiently. Food was of an excellent standard considering the crowd. Definitely a highly recommend and will be going back."}
{"text":"Although the hostess was very friendly, the wait staff was awful.  The food was bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Had a poor experience last night. Three of our five steaks were not prepared as ordered, our appetizers came after we were half way done with our entrees and the flavor was bland. Major disappointment."}
{"text":"How in heaven's name anyone could rate this restaurant above a 1 is beyond me.  Meat quality is definitely low grade.  Avoid at all costs, even though they appear to be low."}
{"text":"We tried to eat at Tony Roma's on Friday evening and the service was so bad we ended up leaving. When we checked in we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. After 40 minutes my wife checked with the host and he said he called our number a long time ago ( no buzzers, they give you a card with a number on it). Considering we were sitting 6 feet from the host stand, we knew he did not call our number.  We also heard him explain to another employee (manager?) that he already sat our number.  Regardless, he ended up seating us 5 minutes later, no apology for messing up. After sitting for over 10 minutes without anyone coming over for our drink order, we left. As we left we one of the employees made a snide remark. Terrible experience!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 13 and thing seemed to be going well when we were seated. our waitress disappeared before our food started coming out, she came back 2 times briefly to fix the mistakes that were made then was gone again till it came time to pay the bill (which also took a long time ). The ribs were dry, the shrimp was rubbery my wife's pasta was cold, it took 45 minutes for everyone to have their meal from when the first one was delivered. the kids were not served first, and we had no drink refills once our food showed up. And you too can have all this for an 18% gratuity that is mandatory. We have made it a tradition to go here for birthday dinners. I doubt we'll be going back. Oh and I ordered the prim rib first, they didn't have that ( fine, take it off your menu )"}
{"text":"GF and I visited in the fall of 2010.  Location is great (I love Freemont St.) but that is about all this restaurant has going for it.  Packed house, the steak was way overdone and thinly cut, the \"lobster\" basically was,... well I don't know what it was,...over sized shrimp?  Over-cooked none-the-less.  Yes, the pricing is cheap here, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I will say that our server was nice and she made an effort to do a good job.  Reality is that Freemont St. is a hard place to find good food, best to stick to pizza by the slice and beers."}
{"text":"Allow me to jump over the food review and skip to the end of my visit to where I was surrounded by security guards, the restaurant manager, and the casino manager. They were ineptly attempting to figure out how to handle an irate customer (me). As you can see, this was not a pleasant experience at a well-run establishment. Nope, it was a horrible evening at a piece of shit crap factory. Now back to the beginning...

THE ORDER: I ordered the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes, garlic green beans, and added a lobster tail. My wife ordered the same, except with the sirloin. One daughter had a sirloin, and the other had a chicken panini with soup.

THE QUALITY: My daughters' meals were alright. The lobster was alright. The mashed potatoes and green beans were alright. My steak and my wife's steak were NOT alright. The ribeye was ALL FAT. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I was able to find approximately 4 bites on it that I was able to eat. The rest was fat, and I could not eat it. I have attached a picture of it. I understand that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat. It is one of my favorites. It is the cut I get every time I eat steak. This steak was not a cut that should have been served to anybody.

My wife's sirloin was inedible due to chewiness. I don't have a picture of hers, but just imagine a piece of meat with 5 bites taken out of it, and all 5 bites spit back onto the plate.

THE COMPLAINT: I asked a server to speak with the manager. About 4 minutes later a guy walks up, and asks what the problem is. I tell him that my ribeye is inedible due to the amount of fat. He simply says, \"okay\" and walks away. The table of 4 just seated next to us overhear this and ask about the bad steak. I show them my food and they are immediately interested in the goings-on.

THE ESCALATION: About 3 minutes later the pompous Japanese manager reappears and says, \"I will remove the lobster from your bill\". I pick up the uneaten steak and say, \"How about you remove this from the bill. I can't eat it\". He goes into an explanation of how they receive the meat and cut it there, and the cut you get is the cut you get. I then pick up the steak and tell him, \"You need to tell your cooks that when they pick up a cut of meat like this, do not cook it. Throw it out. Do not serve it to a customer\". I said \"This piece of meat is shit\". He told me if I speak to him like that, he is going to leave the entire bill with NO reductions and make me pay the whole thing. I say, \"F*#$ YOU\". He says \"Okay, here's your whole bill. Pay it\". I place it on the floor and tell him \"That's where it's going to stay. I'm not paying it\". He says \"I'm going to call casino security\". I tell him \"Alright\". The table of 4 just seated next to us witness all of this and get up and leave, saying that they can't believe a restaurant would treat a customer like that.

We watch the pompous Japanese restaurant manager walk to the hostess booth and use the telephone. A few minutes later two guys from casino security show up as well as the casino manager.

THE RESOLUTION: My wife decides to jump in and save the day. I take our daughters and stand in the lobby area in order to remove myself from the situation. My wife listens as pompous Japanese manager tells casino manager that I devoured all the food on my plate, then screamed profanities at him in an attempt to get a free meal. None of that is true. She walks the casino manager to our table and shows him our plates of food. He then instructs the restaurant to remove our steaks from the bill and tells my wife that I am banned in the future.

THE VERDICT: This restaurant is a fine establishment with excellent food and an extremely courteous staff is what I WOULD say if it were true. Unfortunately, this is a piece of crap excuse for a restaurant serving garbage on a plate with a staff who make Hitler look like a fun play date. My wife says she would have rather dumpster dived for her meal. DO NOT EAT HERE. I can't emphasize that enough. DO NOT EAT HERE. But DO stop in briefly and tell the pompous Japanese manager \"Hee Haw\" because he is a total donkey. I will send a special gift to anybody who goes in, says \"Hee Haw\" to the pompous Japanese manager, and reports it on this review."}
{"text":"Great for kids!  High chairs, booster seats, crayons (in package so no germs), great kids meal and a little veggie appetizer for them to start!

Lots of menu items to choose from for adults."}
{"text":"We went for the $8.99 prime rib b4 6:30pm deal.

I had the double stacked chicken w/spinach sauce=chicken breast w/ spinach dip on top.

I didn't want rice and was offered mix veg.  Mix veg was corn w/ some green beans. NEVER in my life has I gotten lunch room food as a side dish in a restaurant.  My green beans were super oily.

I've never eatten at Tony Roma's before, I'm surely never going to again.  It has the standard fair as any other restaurant.  They just cheapen themselves serving corn as a side dish."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The food did not have the quality we expected. Waitress were braking places ever since we arrived till we left (not exaggerating) and they were basically running. If the restaurant would have been busy, then it would have made more sense but there weren't that many people. Anyhow, our expectations were not met and we let you know here. Good luck."}
{"text":"$11.99 Steak (choice) and Lobster... mixed vegetables and baked potato

Be prepared to wait. 

the staff is helpful. Maria (water lady ) was courteous and prompt."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect when we went here, but were drawn by the $8.99 prime rib special.  Sounds too good to be true, right??  Well, it was absolutely delicious, an 8 oz serving with veggies and a baked potato.  We also has the sirloin steak, at regular price, with an added lobster tail, and both of them were also out of this world!!  Steak was done to perfection (medium-perfect pinkness inside!), and melted in our mouths, and the lobster tail was not rubbery at all, as lobster tends to be if not cooked properly!  Our waitress was nice as could be and very attentive.  The wait at 5:30 on a Friday was about 1/2 hour, which we expected so no problem there!  We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Wow! The tenderloin medallions were out of this world! Full if flavor and choice of topping. The service was fantastic as well. I have no complaints here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to eat here after walking around Freemont Street all evening. We waited about 15 minutes to get seated which I guess is standard for a place so busy. We got the appetizer sampler which consisted of wings, mozzarella sticks, and loaded potatoes. The wings were frozen wings. Mine were still cold in the center. They tasted like the ones I get from costco. Not what you'd expect. I had the sirloin steak cooked medium. They gave me a burned steak on the outside and rare on the inside. Not good at all. My wife got the soup of the day. It tasted like it was out of a can. The quality of the food is very bad. Do not eat here. Go find a different place to eat, unless you like to overpay for frozen wings and canned soup. Overall very dissapointed."}
{"text":"I now call this place Bloaty Fartoma's.  
The service was great.  Who the heck wants to go to a place that only has baked beans or broccoli as a choice for vegetables?  Don't expect to have a pleasant night.  They don't seem to be thinking of their customers.  They need to get with the times.  People are trying to have healthy choices and all you get here is broccoli.  Later you get bloating pains and .....not good people....not good."}
{"text":"Was on Freemont Street and decided to visit Tony Roma's  for dinner. I was really looking forward to the onion loaf but was unable to eat it, all I could taste was grease, and it was swimming in it. Hubby had the prime rib special and said it was \"meh\". We were headed in like cattle, fed and rushed out in 20 minutes. No drink refills, no \"how was it\"... and we still had to pay for the onion loaf with 3 bites out of it. Won't visit again!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for three years now, and the service is always good, as is the food. My daughter (5) loves the ribs, as do I.  Our favorite thing to eat here, though, are the Carolina Honey Bites off the appetizer menu.   I've had nothing like them, so they always hit the spot and start the meal off right.  Strongly recommend to fans of ribs."}
{"text":"The service is very slow.  I ordered the signature salmon is arrived overcooked, no garnish on any of our six dinners to make the meal more appealing to the eye.  Six or us at our table ordered the cookie sandwich for dessert, which is two chocolate chips cookies with ice cream in the middle.  It took 45 minutes to arrive at the table and when it did is was one cookie, ice cream and part of a brownie.  My friend then tried to break the cookie with her spoon to take a bite.  The cookie was so stale that the spoon bent almost in half.  We complained and it was take off the bill.  The menu states a party of eight or more will have automatic gratuity added to the bill.  Our table had six people and this was added.  We complained again.  I would not recommend this place.  Go to the Keg instead."}
{"text":"Been here couple of times with friends if we're happen to be in downtown, but this time our service wasn't good(Debbie) the food server was rude and not to friendly to her guest... just a heads up if you happen to stop by this restaurant..."}
{"text":"I know there are lots of places to get a good burger, but Tony Roma's has a burger with a couple of my fave toppings - havarti cheese and mushrooms, topped off with one of the signature sauces you can't go wrong. 

The menu is traditional American without many surprises. The catch here is that the simple food they make tastes REALLY good. 

I don't recommend the brisket - not if you're used to the smoked-all-day and shredded to perfection kind like I'm used to."}
{"text":"My wife, and I are big fans of Tony Roma's.
Whenever we are in a city that has a Tony
Romas we make it a point to go. We have 
ate in Tony Roma's all over, and have never
been disappointed until our last experience
on Feb. 25, 2015, my wife's birthday. Our 
last visit prior to this was May 07, 2010 our
30th. wedding anniversary ( We renewed our
vows) Tony Roma's was not in downtown 
Las Vegas at this time. Our experience was
great. This last time in downtown Las Vegas
was horrible. We had high hope for our birthday celebration were dashed, they staff
were awful, the food blasé not enjoyable at
all. I know never to go to this horrible place
in downtown Las Vegas ever again. It's not
up to true Tony Roma's standards."}
{"text":"Worst food, worst service. I created this Yelp account just because of this bad experience. We ordered the $11.99 steak and lobster specials. We ordered the steaks medium-rare. When the steak and lobster arrived, both steaks had large completely uncooked portions. This food passed through two points where it should have been noticed: the cooks and the server. Both neglected to notice. Then, when we cut into our steaks, we saw that they were completely raw--through and through. I should also say that the steaks were far inferior in quality and smaller than any I've ever had. They look more like beef intestines that are pressed together into an extremely thin slab. It was not even the color of steak; it was a drab gray color. It is even more amazing that the meat was not cooked, since it couldn't take more than a couple of minutes to cook these sorry excuses for steaks. Our lobster tails smelled foul, so we did not eat them. When we presented the problem to the manager, we were offered $4 off each meal. When I said that they should be refunding both meals and be happy if we don't call the health department, the manager asked \"Is that a threat?\" Additionally, when I went to the restroom, the manager came to our table and yelled about my not being at the table. Seriously? Is this how you treat customers? This is a ridiculous place with ridiculous service. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention their typical clientele type. I saw a guy drinking straight out of a steak sauce bottle here. In my opinion, this place needs to be shut down. I hope that no one gets seriously ill from this place's food."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Doesn't even deserve half a star but there's no other option, other than one. Have been here a handful of times, it's terrible. Last time there was a beetle in my broccoli. Check your veggies people! 
Tonight I got a cold plate of food, forgot the broccoli, brought it out and it wasn't cooked even a little bit. My boyfriends fries were cold and stale, broccoli was the same as mine and his $35 steak was half fat. The only thing worse than their food was the employees. No one smiled. No manners. And to make it worse there was an employee sitting at the bar with her phone plugged in. Really?! How unprofessional. I don't care if it was her break or not, in my opinion that looks terrible. Will not be going back here. Seriously.. Go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I just showed up with friends who invited me to have dinner with them here. Expecting a good meal but we all three received less then warm food. We left the plates and paid for the drinks and walked towards the keg for a hot meal. 

To be honest the staff at tonys was accommodating and also took off the price of the meals which was nice but to see the food taken away to be hopefully tossed out I find sad. 

This was not worth the trip out to this restaurant and it is my belief that it was the waitresses fault for letting the food sit!

The keg currently has taken our order and delivered hot meals before I finished writing this post."}
{"text":"They wouldn't let me order for delivery, even tho the website says it is offered. They woman on the phone was very rude and hung up on me when I told her the website says delivery is offered."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start about this place. First off we got there and the wait was not too long, about 10 minutes. Then, they gave us a table in a dark little corner where my family of 5 had to fit. After I said I need a bigger table that's not so cornered they gave me a booth that fits 4 and when we said that's fine we will just add a chair and sit here they said no sorry we can not do that. So they called the manager which was extremely rude to us and she said you guys can sit in your original seat or wait 35 minutes for a bigger table, we should have left but we were starving so we went back to the little corner and fit somehow. The girl who took our order of drinks was very nice and sweet, but when I asked her where our waitress is she showed me the lady behind her and the lady said I'll be right there and just walked off. She came back and forth a few times and I said excuse me but she ignored me. When I finally asked the drink girl to call her she said I'll be right with you again and walked off once more. When she finally came back she rudely took our orders as if she was in a hurry and left. The food was stale and hard to chew and small portions. The container they gave me coleslaw in was what they put your hot sauce and salsa in at Robertos Tacos. And their soda tasted like tap water. Anyway I can't believe this was a spot in Vegas the service was that of some foreign starving country or something. Never go here save yourselves! I didn't eat much I just asked for s box and took the food home to my dog. Nice $125 dog food."}
{"text":"First off let me start out with some very horrible news. My wife and I went into Tony Roma's this weekend to hear that our favorite server Dustin passed away. He was a amazing server and will be missed very much. We would request him everytime we went to Tony's. My wife was so upset the whole dinner. But besides that the food was excellent as always. I had the ribs and my wife had the chicken caesar salad. We normal stay for dessert, but my wife was to upset to have some. Dustin you will be forever missed. R.I.P Dynamite Dustin."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. This is my fist time at this restaurant and Heath my server was completely amazing. Fun, friendly, and very attentive. I would come back here for the filet mignon. The best I had in years."}
{"text":"Horrible.  I figured there was going to be an issue with the food when it came two minutes after I ordered it.  The service was really quick, and the food was incredibly bad.

I ordered a rib and chicken combo. The food was like it was cooked the day before and microwaved.  I couldn't eat the ribs they were so bad, it literally looked and felt like a chunk of bark.  There was no BBQ sauce on it, super dried out, and very hard.  The chicken was a shriveled little thing that looked about the size of a sparrow.

I would have sent the whole dish back, but I looked around and everybody had the same crappy food.

Do not eat here."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It is a dump in a dumpy place. Food was ok if your expectations are set by the cheap prices. If you expect food good you will be disappointed. Think \"bad diner\" and you have the correct food barometer."}
{"text":"We've been there on Christmas Eve for the world famous ribs and surely were not disappointed.
The only negative thing you probably can come up with, is the fact that they don't do reservations, but the rest is all fine. 
Perfect ribs in combination with fries or corn for the four of us and we were all happy.
Service was fast and friendly once we were in and also - just to make that clear - the lady at the entry desk was friendly, polite abd funny. She kept all queuing guests in control and knew exactly what was possible and what not 

I would always go there again."}
{"text":"Quick and was decent. We split a Turkey Cheddar Melt.. Can't expect much from a chain in the middle of Fremont Street I suppose. Service was good."}
{"text":"We went for the $11.99 steak and lobster tail. We asked the portion size; it is a 5 oz. sirloin and 3 oz. lobster tail. So you get what you pay for. I'm not a fan of sirloin, so I got the pulled pork sandwich. There were a lot of people but every table, except for ours, got their food quickly. We waited about 35 minutes and 2 of our 3 plates were cold. We sent them back with the manager (I had him feel my sandwich and he told the waitress, \"It's legit cold\") and they rushed out new meals for us. It was okay overall (their original barbecue sauce has a very weird/strange taste), but my mom was not happy with her meal. So they removed it from the bill for her. I would've also expected something for mine, but there was not. No big deal. If you're looking for something basic or just right there, I guess it's not so bad, but with so many other options on Fremont, I would suggest going elsewhere if you want to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Went there over Christmas.   We took my father in-law as it was one of his favorite restaurants but I think that will be our last time.   We were standing at the front entrance wanting to be seated and the hostess went to walk past us to seat someone else till we said something.   When we got to our table we were given dirty menus.   The restaurant was not very clean either.   The only reason I am giving this two stars as food was good."}
{"text":"Only reason we found ourselves here was their Mother's Day promotion.  Unfortunately, the voucher was unclear of when we could use it but the manager honored the voucher.  Props for good customer service.  

Unfortunately, it went downhill from there for me.

We ordered the full baby back ribs for $21 which were a smaller portion size than we remember.  We had requested for extra BBQ sauce when we ordered it and had to ask two more times before we got it.  We also ordered the Mojo Chicken for $13 which is their grilled chicken breast with pineapple salsa.  Even with the salsa the chicken was dry and the veggies were soggy.  Our third dish was the pasta with italian sausage for $13.  Oh yes-I-did order pasta at a rib joint and I got what I deserved.  It was served in a red sauce and looked real good and presentable but I would have enjoyed cold spaghetti-o's from the can more than this dish.  It had absolutely no flavor.

Brother loves the BBQ sauce which is their saving grace (along with the manager Michael's proper service) otherwise I would've rated no stars if that's even possible."}
{"text":"The ribs are always good at Tony Roma's. St. Louis style of course, baby backs are for amateurs. do not forget to order the onion loaf because it is awesome. The sides are alright and the sauces pretty much taste the same to me, if you cannot decide stick to the original. The service was just a bit below par. Other than that, it is all about the ribs. 4 stars for the ribs.

Note: This was the location were Lefty Rosenthal got car bombed in the parking lot during the 80's."}
{"text":"I had the St. Louis Style ribs and I was completely disappointed. It was dry and tough with little or no sauce. It's not the same from when I had it years ago when I was a kid wherein the meat would just fall off the bone. Tony Romas is not for me anymore. Famous Dave's wins by a landslide."}
{"text":"This place has the longest wait time to eat. Then you go to a table and they are quick with the drinks, but take forever for anything else. This is by far the craziest place ever."}
{"text":"What?! Kids eat free on tuesdays, all day? Sweetness!"}
{"text":"I thought that this was a good place to stop. The wait staff was very slow the only thing that made this a 2 star instead of a 1 is that the manager was a great guy he tried his best to make it a great experience for me but the food was horrible. I can not get mad at the manager just the the wait staff and the food was horrible. The prim ribs  wasn't even rib it was some weird type of meat. The vegetables were packaged frozen ones and the only thing that made the meal even halfway good is the baked potato because I made it myself."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to this place every year we come down to Vegas. This year the steak was fatter then normal, but still very enjoyable and reasonably priced. So next year when we come we will definitely go back to Tony Roma's"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick dinner.  The seating by the staff was rude and just herding cattle.  We sat down. .... had our silver ware when someone walked by and slammed two more sets down without saying a word.  Then we asked for bread , oh my the way NO BUTTER unless you request it.  . The .steak ordered appeared to have been grilled and then microwaved on a plate.  The waiter then asks how every thing is.  Wrong question.  He became confrontational AND offered to have the chef speak to us.  Then the manager is brought into the fray. His response. .... go to the corporate website and tell them.  These was the worst meal out in a long long long time.  Do yourself s favor pay attention to yelp. ... do not spend your money or time in this place. ...disgusting"}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dinner.  Great specials when you want to be price conscience.  Service has really improved over the years, top notch now.  The only reason I dinged 1 star is that the hostess stand person is never at her station and you end up waiting a minute or two to get seated.  I'm not talking about if she's seating someone else but goofing off in back or something.

If it's mngt has her doing something else, stop, first impressions count."}
{"text":"Pork ribs were great, especially compared to Memphis Champ BBQ.
BUT... my wife had the special of steak and lobster and that was a very lousy meal!  Don't get sucked into the cheap price tag of any special.  Just pay regular price for a regular menu item and I think you'll be satisfied.
Service was especially friendly."}
{"text":"Got seated fairly quickly but waited an hour for food. Server did an incredible job of trying to keep everyone happy but entire restaurant was upset at delay. Even overheard the manager argue with the clients how it wasn't his fault food wasn't coming! Food was tasty if overpriced when it arrived. I had expected higher quality food prep for the price. Did have cheque discounted and tipped our server well. She earned it tonight!"}
{"text":"Went with my family for my birthday - the rice side dish on my salmon entree was very salty that it was inedible. The broccoli side was ok, and my samon-shrimp piccata was salty with no other seasoning, the lemon was not noticeable at all and way too many capers (nice size capers though). My son's kid combo was ribs and fries. The ribs are exactly how I make them at home - I prefer Swiss Chalet ribs. Fries were not salted which I liked for kids. My husband's grilled chicken salad was uneventful with huge chunks of cooked and raw vegetables - it looked like they cleaned out the fridge with how this salad was assembled. Our lunch, with my birthday discount of $10.99 off, came out to be $50 with no alcohol! wow - very expensive for boring, salty food. We went during the lunch hour and we were the only customers- now I know why!"}
{"text":"If it sounds too good too be true, it probably is. 

It used to be that casinos could sell good food as a loss leader, to get people to play the games, but it is clear that the specials themselves are now a cash grab. 

The $12.99 steak and lobster was terrible. 

I've seen better looking steaks in the freezer at Dollar Tree, and I wish that was an exaggeration. It was thin, leathery, and flavorless. 

The lobster tail is an ounce of lobster meat, attached to the shell on the outside, and tasted like it was flash frozen after pre-cooking, and reheated in a microwave. The saving grace was the melted butter, which allowed you to choke down the rubbery lobster meat. 

The mixed vegetables were exactly what you find in any frozen peas, carrots, and corn bag on your grocer's freezer.

The potato was, well, a potato. 

Not only will I never eat at this Tony Roma's, but I won't ever eat at another Tony Roma's either.  

Any chain that would allow their name to be associated with an overpriced TV dinner, billed as a great value restaurant quality meal, obviously has no pride in their brand."}
{"text":"Now I understand when you have a special going on, a restaurant will be a bit more on the busy side. However, when your waitress only comes by 3 times the entire time you're sitting there for almost 1 hour waiting for your food to come to the table, you have issues. The kind and blonde bus woman was more attentive than our waitress. She definitely deserves a promotion or a raise because she's doing the job of a waitress. This restaurant needs some improvements, such as retraining their staff to be more courteous and more attentive to their customers needs instead of just leaving them alone to wait hungry. We didn't get the bread we were promised and waiting over an hour to get your food is ridiculous, especially when it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"The worst Mac n cheese ever!! The ribs were dry & miserable!
The burger had a bitter taste to it!!
Never going back to this franchise!!
Waitress was really nice.
Be prepared for a 45 minute wait for sub standard food!!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas with the 'rents over Veteran's Day weekend.  The Cal and Main St. were all booked up for a Video Poker tournament, so we flipped our comp'ed room over to the Fremont.  The second night in, we ended up eating at the Tony Roma's for the Prime Rib special.

First off, Tony Roma's is pretty busy.  We had to wait 30+ minutes for a table (and this was at 5:30pm).  The decor is very dark and while there are a lot of patrons, we were all pretty spread out.

All three of us ordered the Prime Rib special (since that's our thing to do when we go to Vegas).  It comes with a baked potato and mixed vegetables.  I didn't try the horse radish, but the waitress and my parents said that it was very strong.  The quality of the meat was about on-par with the Market Street Cafe, but maybe a bit less juicy.  It was okay, nothing too impressive.  What I really missed in comparison with the Market Street at the Cal, was no rice and there really wasn't that much au jus.

Instead of the free cherry jubilee (at the Market Street), we shared an order of the dessert sampler.  This is where Tony Roma's regained a star.  The sampler consists of a red velvet cake, apple tart with ice cream, and a brownie with ice cream.  In one word: yum.  I enjoyed all three of the dishes tremendously and they definitely did not scrimp on the portion sizes.

All in all, if the line is too long at the Market Street Cafe, I wouldn't mind coming back here for some prime rib."}
{"text":"Service was par, group in the booth next to us decided to invite more than planned so booth was crowded. Overall not good. Panini sandwich average...still hungry when we left. Might considered somewhere else in the future but wanted to give it a try."}
{"text":"Reviews don't lie! I took my family here for Mother's Day, it was 6 of us. Our server was Maya. We waited half an hour for our table, which is fine. But when we were seated they sat us at a table that only fit 4 people. There was a 2 seat table right next to us, I asked if we could put them together, and Maya told me no. They tried to squeeze 3 people on each side, my family isn't small, they would be squished. So I put the 2 chairs on each side to make it more comfortable. Then, Maya complained they couldn't walk through, and tried to put the chairs back. After that, I lost all patience and said we don't fit! I we need a bigger table or the 2 seater table right next to us. She said she had to ask the hostess, and finally the hostess put the other table next to us, not my own server.. As we were leaving I saw 6 people seated comfortably at tables they could fit in. I don't know why they would treat us like that! Overall, I had just had a horrible experience because of that. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got food poisoning from the lobster/steak special. My spinach and artichoke dip came with wet (yes, wet) chips so I sent it back. They were soggy and stale. Our server was great but it couldn't compensate for the awful food. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant EVER.

GET THE CAROLINA HONEY WINGS. I don't care if you don't get appetizers usually, I can pretty much guarantee this is the best appetizer you will have. 

heck get Carolina honey anythings, and if you don't live in vegas consider stocking up on sauce. I'm not joking, carolina honey's is addicting and you will go into withdrawal...

Blue Ridge Smokey ribs are just, bam, rich and smokey. I also get Carolina honey ribs too, just amazing.

Bread rocks...

There is a reason ROBERT DE NIRO eats here in the movie CASINO, and why the brand is world famous

YOU.... MUST.... GO...

{"text":"Bartender Brian is okay is not a people person and not very friendly and I did not have it we did not have a good experience"}
{"text":"I was there on a Saturday night and got the steak and lobster special. It was not bad at all. I didn't like the mixed vegetables and they charged an outrageous price for a salad but overall it was quite tasty. There was about a 45 minute wait but the food came out extremely fast."}
{"text":"I should have known when the host told us we wouldn't like the special anyway.  Their special was \"STEAK AND LOBSTER $11.99\".  We were looking for a place to eat and figured hey we'd give it a try.  Upon arriving at Tony Roma's inside of the Fremont Casino we had to snake all the way towards the back of the casino and saw a line waiting for Tony Roma's special.  Little did I know the term 'special' was las vegas local slang for \"stupid tourists, come to me, come to Tony Romas and freely waste your time and money\"

I knew better, my wife and mother in law they gave it a try.  I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries and a bowl of the french onion soup.  The soup was ok, but the sandwich sucked and so did the fries.  I waited for the steak and lobster arrive and when it came, I laughed.  I've seen shrimp larger than the lobster that came with the steak and I've also seen shoe leather with less gristle than the steaks that came out.

Lesson learned, if you want really sucky food and really bad service, come get tortured at Tony Roma's.  We even had a lady pass out and be taken away by the paramedics while we were dining at Tony Romas.  I wonder if it was a trick to get out of the bill."}
{"text":"Food delicious!

Service... friendly, but slow.  Little things like receiving that bread you are supposed to get in the beginning...when we were almost done with our meal."}
{"text":"Terrible, this chain has gone down hill. I'll make this short and sweet. 

Our table was dirty, I had to ask 3 times to get a clean glass and then I ended up switching with someone who had a clean glass that wasn't drinking. 

Lastly a chicken finger dish is $18 with tax... Used to be $12. That is ridiculous, especially seeming its nothing close to high class and the plate only came 4 4 inch strips, which we're subpar. At another restaurant I frequent I can get 4 6 inch thick strips for $9. The restaurant was loud filled with a kids birthday group of about 14 people. 

We will never be eating at any of these restaurants again. Save your money."}
{"text":"We came for the &11.99 steak and lobster dinner and the steak was horrible (I know I know it's $11.99 for steak and lobster, can't expect much) but it was really BAD!!! Service was shitty and not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Came here per parents' choice (they were treating) for the $11.99 steak and lobster special. As others mentioned, there was a bit of a wait. We waited about 20 minutes, killing time in the casino. After getting seated, we were quickly greeted and our orders taken. So why only 2 stars.

For a place like Tony Roma's, I expect a bit of quality control when it comes to cooking their meat and plating. I ordered the steak and lobster special and when it was served, the vegetables looked like they were just thrown on the plate and the steak looked like it didn't rest very much as there was a giant pool of liquid under the veggies (could have been from the veggies too. Not too sure). The lobster was cooked alright. Nice and tender, but for some reason, was missing that richness I love in lobster. The steak on the other hand was a total miss. I ordered it medium rare and it came out decently cooked, but was all kinds of dry. It was actually pretty hard to stomach. But what can you expect for $11.99. I feel like they're just pumping out steaks so QC isn't as high as going to a normal Tony Roma's.

My brother got the ribs and they tasted like the ribs you'd usually get, so do yourself a favor and pay a little more and get the ribs and not the steak."}
{"text":"Went in for a late night meal, food was kinda bland, but not awful. The server was really friendly but the bar guys were just flat out rude to our happy drunk friend. I realize he was drunk but hey we are in Vegas and having a good time, no need to condescending especially after we all bought food and 6 shots of alcohol."}
{"text":"So Tony Roma's responds to my review with a template, then asks to me to follow up with further detail, to which I receive another template. What a joke. If they want me back they will have to do more than spam me with their social networking robots. Again lazy, lazy, lazy, their customer service as is their kitchen. Never ever ever going back."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here.  Food was mediocre at best, the service was rude and the servers were rushing us.  And some of the food that was ordered never arrived.  Won't go back here again."}
{"text":"Went here for a family birthday party. We shared food, so I got to try many dishes:
- shrimp cocktail: large shrimp, perfectly cooked
- onion loaf: a sculpture of greasy, tasty onion rings that were undersalted
- artichoke dip: boring, flavorless
- baked potato: would be good if they had real butter, but no such thing here
- ribs: dried out, tough meat.  I liked the Blue Ridge Smokies sauce better than the Original.
- BBQ chicken: tasty
- apple crisp: no flavor and disappointing crust
- red velvet cake: yummy cream cheese frosting
- brownie sundae: very rich, dark brownie
I guess some of the food was good, but shouldn't their ribs stand out?  And other dishes were just dull.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Don't buy from here. The ribs are close to being meatless. We had ordered take out. St.Louis ribs and baby back Ala Carte.  And had to order pizza to fulfill our hunger."}
{"text":"Worse quality of food I've ever eaten. I could have gone to sonic and gotten filled up and enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this Tony Roma restaurant inside the Fremont Casino a couple of times.  The reason is because the one that was near where we live closed down.  We liked going to have our ribs at Tony Roma's and so we come here to experience what we miss.  The St. Louis ribs are just as we remembered, the sweet BBQ sauce, and always one of my favorite coleslaw.  Food wise this Tony Roma's is great.  My beef is the process of getting into the restaurant.  Because no lunch, everyone comes for dinner and it can be a long wait.  Then it is a quick dash to find the table with an equally quick waitstaff.  It is all about getting you in and out.  I am perhaps a bit critical here, but I like to savor the experience of having Tony Roma's ribs when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a quick dinner at about 8pm. We were greeted by our waiter who took our drink orders. Angel was our waiter. He gave us time to enjoy our onion loaf before bringing out our dinner. Drinks never got past half full and he wasn't pushy or overbearing. The food was great! The service was great and we will be back."}

{"text":"8.99 for prime rib and lobster?? Of course my friends and I hopped on it!
It was a 30 minute wait until we got to try this place. My friends and I were hungry and tipsy and couldnt wait to try this place. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got seated and all ordered medium cooked steak with lobster. While the dish was set on our table, our mouths drooled and couldn't wait until we take the first bite. The first bite of the steak tasted like rubber and had no taste (even though we ordered medium and it was red still). The lobster had no taste. We all know that when we're drunk, everything tastes better, but this place definitely didnt taste good at all. It actually woke me up from being tipsy because i was shocked at how it turned out and how much i had to actually chew to swallow the meat.  
I guess it's true, you get what you pay for. 
This place was a definite no and i dont recommend this place."}

{"text":"Went here for dinner. The food was good and it came at a reasonable price. This meal was a good value. Plus it is right on Freemont Street with all of the lights."}
{"text":"Steak and lobster for under 20$ c'mon how can you beat that? Ok long wait time for a table up to an hr at times. Not the greatest tasting meal you can get but its eatable. Some of the ratings on here is a bit harsh, for what you pay you can't expect the same for 50$ a plate."}
{"text":"Great place with great service. Christina gave exceptional service. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite awhile and never in Vegas. Went to Mob Museum and after 4 hrs in there wanted foooood! We were walking by and the pictures on the wall called us in, lol. We got in on the 8.99 prime rib dinner special just in time. My was that gooood. I got medium and bf got med rare. It came fast and it was hot and it was goood. We ate every morsel! Now we can wander around."}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside a casino in the Fremont experience. What drew us to the restaurant was a sign on the outside of the casino 9-11pm $11.99 steak and lobster. It was worth it! We had a party of 5 and had a 40 minute wait, but it's Vegas so we just went across to the next Casino and played some table games. 

The steak and lobster is served with a baked potato and a mix of what looks like canned veggies (corn & peas), side of butter, and sour cream. I ordered my steak rare which is what I do in most non-steakhouse places so it actually comes out how I like it, medium rare. I also asked for some ranch to pep up my baked potato."}
{"text":"I put pictures of roaches that were seen at this location when dining. Yelp says that businesses can't pay them to review bad reviews or images but this is not the case with my review. Pictures are outta here..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. Instead I gave it 1 star. We have been wanting to go to Tony Romas for some time and we finally did last night. It was busy, which we thought was pretty cool, figured it would be a good experience, boy were we wrong.

It was so loud you could barely hear anyone talk. The place seemed under staffed and our waiter was pretty much non-existent after our order arrived, which, by the way, sucked. The ribs were warm, not hot, and basically flavorless really. I've  had better chicken strips from Schwann's and the cole slaw was horrid. The ONLY thing good from our experience were the alcoholic drinks. We could have had a better time at any fast food place...it was that bad. Such a disappointing experience for such a big name place. You would think being in a tourist spot like Fremont Experience you would want the place to be in tip top order. Apparently the management could care less about that."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Tony Roma's with a friend.  We stopped in for a light lunch mid afternoon.  We decided to belly up to the bar to enjoy our meal.   The bartender there was really great.  She was friendly and talkative! 

They had a lunch menu with an option for unlimited soup and salad for $7.99.  Fantastic deal!  Plus she informed us that you could change up soups and salads to try their different varieties.   I decided on their strawberry and walnut salad accompanied by the potato soup. The salad was great!  The strawberries gave it a great flavor mixed with the textures of the nuts and lettuce.  

The soup unfortunately didn't do it for me.  It was very bland.  It almost tasted like they used too much flour to thicken it instead of cream.   Bummer.    I was full after one serving of each so I didn't get to take advantage of the unlimited.  If my stomach wasn't full, I would've had seconds of the salad but tried a different soup.  

The service was good but not great.  I had to flag her down a few times for a drink refill. I do think it was better than an average restaurant hence the 4 stars.  I'll probably give it another try again someday especially with their lunch deals.  :-)"}
{"text":"My husband & I were very satisfied with our steak & lobster dinner. My husband liked his steak a little more than I did. That's only because I'm more of a prime rib person. It came with a large baked potato and corn. The desert was the perfect ending. Pick any 3 for $8. We had a brownie with ice cream, warm apple tart with ice cream and a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream all delicious. Although there was a lot of people we only had to wait 20-25 min for seating we had a great waitress and the food came out fast.  Definitely worth a try if your looking for steak & lobster dinner under $15. Then the outside entertainment on Fremont St made our night."}
{"text":"When we arrived, they said it'll be a 20 min wait for a table for 5. Ended up being like 6 mins. So that was happily surprising. We ordering ribs, burgers, steak, and chicken tenders. The rib& chicken tender dinner with fries I ordered was enjoyable. I requested red hot bbq sauce on my ribs, so I really liked that. The coleslaw that comes with each plate was not so tasty. But honestly, there was nothing really special about this place, nothing really stood out to me. It was just good.....that's it"}
{"text":"Ohhhh dear lord. The service was good. The spinach artichoke dip was good enough. The baked potato was edible, with a lot of \"vegetable oil spread\" and sour cream. The garlic green beans tasted like propane. The bacon Mac and cheese tasted like the stuff from the box, only made with three cheese packets. Shall we talk about the sirloin you see advertised everywhere? MIDWESTERNERS RUN THE OTHER WAY. It looked delicious, then I tried to stick my fork in it to cut it. Yeah, didn't happen. The fork couldn't pierce the surface of the steak. And chewing it? Forget it.  It also smelled rather peculiar, kind of how my snake's cage smells after she sheds and pisses everywhere. Save the baked potato, my entire meal was given to a homeless person. At least someone enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Where to go on Meatless Monday. ...hmmmm. ..Tony Roma's??  Sure why not! Testing my willpower again.  Im not really a fan of the bigger chain restos or the previously frozen processed foods they serve up. The $7 -  $10 lunch combos is what caught my attention and the strawberry pecan salad that I chose to go with my Eggplant sandwich sounded good and what got me in the door.  Kudos for having good menu selections for those who opt out from having ribs.
  
It didnt start off on the right foot at first...the soup I chose Chipotle Sausage and Roasted Veggie was sodium laden. After two teaspoons I was so done with it.  When the server brought out my entree though she noticed I barely touched the soup and asked why and I told her it was too salty for me.  She didnt skip a beat and said she'll bring me out another cup of soup, their baked potato one. Gold shiny star for her for being so observant and more than happy to oblige a customer.
 
Eggplant sandwich was okay. I didnt care for the bbq steak sauce they smeared on the bread.  Next time Ill ask for it on the side. The veggies were sauteed enough to where you really dont need that much more sauce for added flavor.  The strawberry pecan salad was refreshing, the fruit in season and just the right amount of dressing was added, so no soggy greens here.  Whew.  

3.5 stars for food but rounding up to 4 because their staff at this place did a great job and the prices are real reasonable for families."}
{"text":"You get a cheap meal with steak and lobster tail for $11.99 it's not great and it's not too bad....you get what you pay for. I will skip this next time lol"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and my family decided to go out for dinner. With no reservation we were seated in less than 20min. They even got us a booth which we requested. The service was friendly and atmosphere was inviting. Although very busy, we got excellent service. This is proven by the fact that my two boys, ages 4 & 6 were not bouncing off the walls by the time dinner arrived. The ribs were awesome, of course and the kids pretty much ate everything. Both my husband's and my steak were done to perfection. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"While there is nothing but dessert, salads and sides for a vegetarian to eat at Tony Roma's, I may not be able to comment on the actual entrees, but I can comment on the general ambiance & atmosphere of the place.

I'm with Lindsay K. when she says that the North location of TR's is much more appealing. It's just more warm, friendly and inviting than this particular location.

Our server wasn't anything to write home about either - she didn't seem to care if we were enjoying our TR experience or not.

Although I've only been to Tony Roma's less than a handful of times, there's nothing that would make me want to return, especially not to this location."}
{"text":"Great food and great sauces here.  I personally prefer the beef ribs with the Blue Ridge Smoky sauce -- they are the best, most meatiest beef ribs I've ever tasted, aside from The Cheesecake Factory's (which have been discontinued as of this review date).  The baby back ribs are also very good, I like them with the Carolina Honey sauce (that also goes well with the chicken -- any kind of chicken).  Pretty much every item on the menu is good, plus they serve warm bread with the meal...I can't recommend this place enough.

Breakdown: I rate it #3 as the best baby back ribs, behind Outback Steakhouse (#1) and TGI Friday's Jack Daniels Ribs (#2).  I rate it #2 best beef ribs after The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Well I thought I would never be a review poster but I feel obligated to the rest of the United States to post about this restaurant.  Simply do not eat here. If you are looking for a cheap meal in Vegas, just go grab a burger or something of a more pub fare restaurant. Do not be fooled into thinking you will get decent or even so so steak meal for a great price here.  Dirty tables, uncaring servers, wait times between water/drinks, etc are long, and horrible food is what you get.  We ordered an appetizer platter (cheese sticks, hot wings, bacon/cheese potato skins), and I am not kidding when I say they were exactly I mean exactly like something from a microwave.  You will get better apps from a microwaved frozen meal actually if you go for a higher end frozen product at the store.  I ordered the ribeye for $22.95.  medium rare. Came out well done. I mean not a shred of pink in the  meat. completely gray/white all the way through and tough.  Sent it back. I mean had it been a little pink, I would have ate it. but had to send it back.  What I got back was unbelievable--- the new ribeye looked like ahi tuna, literally seared lightly gray on both sides and COMPLETELY raw in the middle.  Sent my whole dish back telling the server to kill the meal and I would not eat here.  Serve  just said, 'Can I offer you some ribs ?... as I assume they just have a vat of pre prepared ribs they can slop out quickly.  I opted for nothing, hands down would not pay for anything here. My wife had a filet which was tough as a sirloin. She opted for the blue cheese melted crest addition.  Don't do that, what you get is a giant luke warm blob of white stuff that tastes like a gooey blue cheese like substance and ruins the steak should it happen to be remotely enjoyable.  Beans, potatoes, garlic mashed, all were of public school cafeteria quality at best.  Goal of this joint is pure volume, heard em in and hear em out, they don't care about their service, quality/taste of food, or what you have to say judging from most reviews.  Its a gut fill at best for someone low on budget but even then I imagine there are better options. I would eat at ANY fast food joint before here.  The only good thing was my meal was off the receipt so I didn't pay for it and I took $70 off the casino here at the craps table and made the waitress fetch me 3 free drinks in the process.  So I win but never again will I set foot in this joint."}
{"text":"After eating out at a Ruth's Chris Steak house and not thinking the food was quite worth the price the night before (over $100 per person for dinner), we decided to take advantage of the $8.99 prime rib special while hanging out on Fremont St.  
Well, you get what you pay for sometimes. 
When we were seated there were two police officers talking to an elderly gentleman because he did not have money to pay his bill.  I think it would have been better if he had been escorted outside to finish the conversation, but it went on for at least 20 minutes even after another patron offered to pay his bill.  
Meanwhile, we had no service.  I understand completely servers not wanting to come over amid the situation, but then WHY seat us if you're not going to serve us???? 
After the man was led out, a waitress finally came over to take our order.  Over 30 minutes later, we still did not have food.  Another server came over and gave us refills on drinks which was very thoughtful.  However, when I asked him if he could check on our food, he got irritated and walked away while I was still communicating. I was trying to explain to him that two tables next to us arrived AFTER we ordered and had already been served.  I was not rude at all, but he did not want to hear it. To his credit, he is the only server who refilled our drinks on multiple occasions.  Our waitress did not fill our drinks once.  She came over to check, I think, once.  However, our drinks had just been replaced by the other server--the one who ignored my question about our food arriving.
The food, ironically, arrived minutes later.  It was good.  We had never been to Tony Romas before, and the food was pretty good and amazing for the price. 
When we left I did communicate my frustrations to the manager who was very nice.  By then I was frustrated.  Even though I was clearly annoyed at the poor service (and I was pissed that the server ignored me when I asked if he could check on our food), he was kind and patient.  I planned on one star, but bumped it up to two for the nice manager.  
If you're broke and NEED to eat here, feel free to do so.  My time is worth more, so next time it will be a more expensive place just so my time is not wasted."}
{"text":"We Had the blackened salmon and the steak and lobster I thought the food was decent very good pricing ...I see the the reviews on here are all over the place we had a good experience and I'm pretty particular about my food so maybe it just depends on when you go"}
{"text":"I was strolling down Fremont St. at night and always see the Tony Roma's 11.99 steak and lobster so I mustered up the courage to try it. It was well worth it. The waiter said it was about a 20 min wait at 9 o clock but we were seated in 10 mins. The service was quick and great for us.
The food was ok, especially for the price and the bbq sauce they have is delicious. Also besides the ribs the kickin shrimp is delicious as well.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The ribs are king here  . I would give them a B  . Skip the steak .  The onion loaf was decent .I would go here again ..."}
{"text":"I have to echo many of the negative sentiments others have noted.  Service isn't always good, music is horrible. The place is usually dead, which is why you sometimes have to wait for someone to check the entrance. Also, yes, don't do the chicken, or the pasta.

But, alas, I still like the place. Why? Great lunch menu. The lunch specials (11am to 4pm?)  are fairly priced and I've had a number of good meals. I recommend the Roma burger ($9 I think) and today I had the St. Louis ribs ($13.50) which were good. Both served with a generous supply of fries. In the end, I leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to Tony Roma's on a Thursday night was because I had won a gift card, and I had to spend it, after sitting on it for almost a year. 

Honestly not much to say. I think there were like 8 birthday parties happening there that night, all for 8 year olds. I have nothing against 8 year olds, but I still asked to be seated in the 'Bar' section. Snoooooze. It was empty. We ordered the Kickin Shrimp to start. Which, by the way, was AWESOME. I thought \"man, this seems like its going to be a damn fine meal!\" after which I proceeded to order the beef short rib. The boyfriend ordered the rib and filet mignon combo. Hey, gotta spend that $50 on the gift card, you know. The food came. I stared at my plate. It was abysmal at best. They gave me a gigantic plate, and the food was on one half of the plate. The other half was completely empty. I dont mean in the fancy schmancy Dale Mackay kind of an empty plate. I mean an embarrassing \"umm, why is this giant plate empty on the right? Am I getting a side? Did you guys run out of plates and had to use a serving dish and then couldnt figure out how to fill it??\" kind of way.

I bit into the beef short rib. It was tender alright, I'll give them that. But the seasoning on it was WEIRD. I am not one to find food weird. But this seasoning/sauce was WEIRD. Not tasty. Just a strange taste. I am not sure how else to describe it, except it wasnt good enough for me to finish. 

I tried to salvage the meal by playing some pool there on their coin-operated pool table. Even that area was cramped. My boyfriend and I kept hitting the chairs and tables with our cue sticks. Annoying.

That was my Thursday night. Yes, you are allowed to be embarrassed for me.

{"text":"So, the wife and I went to Freemont street and saw the name and recalled it was from.Hawaii.  we aaw a sale for steak and lobster tail for 11.99 from 9-11 and we said hey let's try some cheap eats.  I had heard of Hugo's around Freemont being a good choice but didn't know where it was...

So we got the NE clam chowder and mozzarella sticks as an app.  I liked the chowder and the sticks were ok... little too much breading. 

Advice: order medium-rare.  Medium was actually well done.   

The steak was good.  The tail was fine.  The potato was good.  The veggies were ok.

We got the red velvet cake to share.  It was tasty."}
{"text":"$11.99 Steak and Lobster!

That's what got us in here when we were checking out Fremont St. just to see what it was like.

The steak was a 10oz sirloin that was medium well not medium rare, and the lobster was the tail from a lobster that was probably under 1lb. Definitely frozen veggies on the place too. Like you had when you were a kid.

The place was filled with people that were partying and gambling earlier in the night since the special started at 9pm.

Service was super prompt and efficient. Not sure I'll ever be back here since Fremont St. is only cool to check out once, but it wasn't as bad as I expected."}
{"text":"What red-blooded carnivore of an American can resist a $8.99 Prime Rib? It's Vegas and other places are offering low priced prime rib so something has got to be up. $8.99 was less than the $12.99 deal I saw so I decided to walk in. My .99 cent 16 oz. beer in hand and very curious.
The casino smells like an ash tray and by this time in Vegas the smell of smoke indoors went from novelty to old. But a pushed past it and confirmed the price on the Prime Rib. Then I walked out, only to rethink my decision because I figured I had enough time of the meter polish this order off and keep on moving. I sat down and placed my order. Then I looked around waiting and saw the servers were bringing out plate after plate of Prime Rib. It's at this price between 4pm-6pm and clearly popular. When my order came it looked good. Prime Rib, a small baked potato and mixed vegetable And you know what? For the price this was pretty good. Yeah it's $8.99 but it's just what you'd expect for the price. If you really like prime rib, this is just what you'd expect to have for the price. That's fair and I was happy because i knew this and knew too that if I wanted more, I could and should pay for more. But for what it is, it's just right. I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"First time coming here was a good experience . I must say our waitress Jesse was amazing ,she was on top of everything. Her attention to us was great. Definitely  will be paying another visit.  Also Charles was great."}
{"text":"Food is always great and service is excellent!!!!  Always go in there and have a food experience. The chicken spinach stack is my ultimate favorite. They are reasonably priced for the amount of food that you receive. I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"The only reason i don't give this 5 stars is the prices are a bit high, but actually it's not much different than any other RIBS place.  I absolutely love the RED HOT BBQ sauce.  We come here for our Anniversary every year because we ate at a Tony Romas the night I proposed to my wife.  We love it every time we come.  Also the Brocoli is super awesome, soft, flavorful brocoli."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and the service was awful, we barely saw our waitress and the bus boy was they one keeping our drinks full. Every time my husbands coffee was refilled it was spilled all over.... the food was very poor quality . We couldn't even finish it and we are not usually picky people. Don't waste your time of money here.... there are much better places to eat at."}
{"text":"Located inside the freemont hotel... decent prices. That's the best I can say. A 30 min wait for a place that did not have a full restaurant. Not once did we get asked if we wanted refills on drinks. We had to wave someone down to get this refill. We places our order and the waiter even repeated that back to us. We waited and got 1 appetizer. The couple next to us ordered the exact same entrée and a few more items then we did and got all there food before us. Once again we waived someone down and asked about our main entrée and we'll let's just say it was never ordered... honestly no surprise the place has low star ratings. Decent prices, decent food, but could use some staff development in drinks and ordering..."}
{"text":"Had my food coming in and out 3 times due to \"misunderstanding\", waitress very unprofessional, the food is nothing but OK- at the best.
Not gonna come back!!!"}
{"text":"After having never eaten here, never hearing much about it, always wanting to try it and FINALLY getting to, I was a little disappointed. 

We waited FOREVER (it seems) to be seated. We looked around and there were maybe 4 - 5 other tables of people spread through the place. We were finally seated, and then ignored for the next 10 or more minutes. By the time our server came to us, we had just decided to leave. Since she was right there, we decided to stay. We placed our orders and finally got our drinks. 

In the meantime, we were asked if Danny had taken care of us. When we said yes, the response we received was \"good, she can be a little slow. Gotta love her though, she's got two kids\". 

So, let me get this straight... I can have 2 kids and not be expected to do my job well and STILL be loved?? That's awesome, I better get to work having kids so I don't have to work so hard. 

The food was decent, though I've had better, and the experience definitely effected it. I would have been able to say I would go back sometime if I wasn't so put off by the poor service and the excuses made for it. 

My husband might be willing to give it another try, but he'll be doing it without me."}
{"text":"Brutal. Have been waiting here for an hour only have our drinks. They sat us at a table right underneath the air exchange and the hostess was completely rude to us about our seating (told us we had to wait 30 minutes for a table but the same table we got seated in was one that was unoccupied with a bunch of old food on it for the same 30 minutes). Two hours in we get our meals. All of the ribs (4 plates) are burned with the burned side down, assuming that we'd never notice????? Our server called \"Nick\" who I am assuming is the manager, who took three of the four ribs off of our bill. But our server came back over and threw her staff under the bus saying, \"our cooks range from 15-21 years old, so sorry.\" Will never return. Most likely will close just like the Macleod location did."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, or your time. The service is reflective of the food... uninspired. Heard many people raving about this chain and I don't know why. The ribs which are what they are supposedly known for, must be just a mass market gimmick. Gave this place a chance... but there are much better choices in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"One thing I always appreciate about Tony's is the consistency of the product that is coming out of the kitchen. Even in chain restaurants this can be hard to achieve but they do a great job.

If I am going to Tony Roma's, I am going for the ribs. Pretty much never stray from my regular order of baby back ribs with Carolina honey bbq sauce. Meat is fall off the bone soft to the pint you can eat it with a knife and fork, and still get the bones clean.

Love the choice of 2 sides with the meal, and that you can get a little fancier options for an up-charge.

On this occasion my friends baby back ribs were pretty tough. She mentioned it to the waitress who immediately offered to get it changed for her, brought another plate so she could keep eating her fries and got that changed in the kitchen straight away. Kitchen did a great job of getting the new ribs out and they were perfect second time around. Definitely a fluke as never had that happen before, but great customer service getting it sorted out.

Any time I feel for ribs this is my number 1 choice. Plus if you ask for your garlic mashed potatoes fully loaded they will bring you cheese, bacon, green onions, and sour cream on the side for them at no charge! Bliss."}
{"text":"Very poor quality service and food.  Denny's level, also turned away about 50 people during hours they were open because they were too lazy and very poorly managed.  I will never return!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick lunch with my wife; we had Turkey Cheddar sandwich and I had Tony's Tenderloin Sliders, we both enjoyed a cup of their baked potato soup. Just tell the waiter/waitress when you sit down that you are a break only and still get great service and well prepared food, both of us out the door for $24.82 plus tip. Not bad and tasted great."}
{"text":"Meh. It's a chain. It's alright for what it is. But you definitely find better places to eat. This location is inside the Fremont Casino. It gets pretty crowded, so expect a wait. The service was friendly and efficient. Albeit the food was far from quick. But our drinks never even got halfway finished before we had refills. I had the sirloin topped with blue cheese. Most of their entree items come with your choice of two sides. I opted for the fries and bacon mac 'n' cheese. Everything tasted alright. But none of it was exactly good. It was like buffet quality food (and I don't mean the nice, upscale buffets). Overall, it an a-ok experience. But I definitely wouldn't specifically choose to eat here."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! I read Linette P's comments...and ACTUALLY being in the restaurant buslness as a manager, for over 20 years, I understand why you cannot get sat EVEN when there are empty tables. Because there is no one there to serve you! Hello people. I wont seat a guest that I cant take care of! 

But once we were sat our server, Andrea, was amazing! She was running a very large section but still made time to ensure our meal went flawlessly... which it did. In MY opinion... a very well run place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service but a little expensive. I love the ribs here which are delicious. To make things better they have a perfect margarita which is amazing, PLUS lobster bisque on Fridays which is very good. The employees here are all very friendly including the hostess, bartender, and servers. Combine all that great food with great service and you have a great restaurant. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because its a little on the pricey side. Basically this location deserves 5 stars but I had to deduct a star because of the corporate decisions about pricing."}
{"text":"I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's, so I used to it to get some takeout since I am alone this week and my husband is gone on a business trip. Otherwise I would have brought him with me and we could have dined in! 
I'd never eaten here before, so I thought it would be great to give their food a test run.

The girl who brought my food out, (hostess I assume by outfit) walked over with a straight face and asked me if my name was the one on the to go order. It was. She handed me the food and still with a straight, almost unfriendly face asked for the coupon. I handed it to her and gave her a tip also. I always tip, even on free food! I was a server for 2 years at Red Lobster. She didn't smile once and gave off a very unfriendly, almost hostile vibe. Really made me sad. She made me feel like crap for using the coupon that the company sent me!! And I gave her a tip!! Its not like she got nothing out of it!
I ordered the steakhouse burger (was craving a yummy burger since Im pregnant) and fries. The fries were bad. Not crispy but chewy and not very salty. The burger was pretty yummy, but was slopped in the box carelessly. :/ 
Doesn't seem like good customer service. This was my test run, and I know not to go back and take my husband now."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!! I will never return here again. The food tasted old and rancid. I ordered a \"steak\" that was rubbery and bland. Awful! I wouldn't even give this place a one star, but yelp requires at least one star."}
{"text":"Bf and I had spent the day downtown and were getting hungry. We saw the signs for Tony Romas $11.99 steak & lobster special so we decided to go there. Unfortunately the special is only after 9pm and it was only 6.. Damn. Okay so what specials do you have that are available now? Our server told us about the $8.99 prime rib with veggies and baked potato. The bf went with that and I chose the St. Louis Ribs sampler. Our food came out in 5 minutes. The prime rib was nothing special it was small and bland, the veggies were from a can and the potato was a potato. The ribs were very tender but the sauces all tasted the same. Fries were warm. Everything was just warm like it was already made and sitting under heat lamps. I swear we were in and out of there in 20minutes fastest meal ever! Will not return. Probably won't ever go to another Tony Romas again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Tony Roma's. I got the chicken with creamed spinach with wild rice some other stuff. Pretty yummy. My friends got the steaks/lobster tail and ribs dishes and said they were just \"ok\". Not great but not bad. Their onion loaf and mozzarella sticks were good. It was incredibly busy and there was a wait for the table. But our server, named Suerte, was really nice and on the ball, so cheers to her. All in all, an ok meal if you don't mind the noise/crowd."}
{"text":"We only had a little time for a meal due to running late to an event.  We had seen an ad for a reasonably priced prime rib dinner.  I like my prime rib medium rare & ordered it that way.  My meal came out after about 5 minutes and it was medium and it certainly didn't look like the ads.  For the price, it was ok, I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal, but clearly, it was pre-prepared and not made to order."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go there. My best friend of 30 years came in from Pennsylvania it was her 47th birthday. I went ahead and snuck away from the table to tell the manager it was her birthday so that I could be embarrassed her and he said that they could bring out a Sunday and that at the end of the meal it would come out.Well we ordered our food or appetizer came out really quick we didn't even take a couple bites out of it and our main course was already there so we just went along with it then they went ahead and drop the check off and I had to go behind her head and tried to tell the waiter that it was her birthday and he proceeded to come up with a menu and say to something for your birthday. Needless to say my whole plan was totally ruined. That I went ahead and talk to a female manager and She stated that she spoke with the male manager and that he got things confused and that she was very very sorry. They proceeded and even charged me the birthday cake and all they could do was say I'm sorry. The lobster tails were cold my ribeye was like fat. This had to be one of the most horrible experiences I have ever had at a restaurant in my whole entire life. Needless to say I will never come back again. I'm so pissed that you ruined my birthday surprise to my friend my best friend of over 30 yearsI was so looking forward to embarrassing her and you ruined it. And the food sucked was horrible. I was waitress When Lonestar steakhouse was out here and the food that we served Compared to what I ate there was horrible. I was so looking forward to coming to eat there I had heard so many good compliments about that place I am so disappointed and it is a shame that management can't relay messages and communicate you guys need to get it together. Shame on you for ruining something that was soooo special to me!!!"}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this eatery 4 stars, is that I'm calling it a great deal for Fast and Delicious Food.

We were on our way to the Coffee Shop when I heard the P.A. Announcement calling out names for tables at Tony Roma's.  As we were passing the entrance, I noticed the sign for the $8.99 Prime Rib Dinner Special.  We looked at each other and said why not!

It was a very popular special so we had a 10 minute wait.  However, once we we were seated at our table, immediately water and menus appeared.  We both opted for the special and ordered after our waitress delivered our glasses of wine.  Within seven or eight minutes, our Prime Rib Dinner Special was placed before us.  It came complete with Baked Potato and Steamed Mixed Vegetables.  Au Jus, Creamy Horseradish and sour cream was also provided.

It was done perfectly, medium-rare, juicy and tender!  For $8.99, fast friendly service at a table and all while spending only 40 minutes time, Tony Roma's beat any Fast Food counter or Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"i go to this tony romas all the time , i read the last reviewers opinion and i decided i better give mine ! yes the tony romas is dead but i love it ! never a line for dinner or lunch and the food comes very fast ! i eat there a few times a month and i have never had a problem with anything ! great place to eat and sooo yummy"}
{"text":"Most people who know me know that I don't regularly go to chain restaurants but this one is right in the mist of an area where I shop that is close to my apartment and work, so I've stopped in here a few times. Plus, the area is pretty jammed with chain restaurants so sometimes you have to pick the least of all the evils. 

Usually when I stop in here I've been shopping and am in the mood for protein, wine, and someone else to cook for me. Plus the bar is pretty decent for someone who is eating alone. I've come in here several times and the bartender has always been fairly friendly. I can say that one of the bartenders turned me on to a fairly reasonable priced red wine that I've served to a few people who came over and had great responses. Love when someone can do that for me.

The selection here is much what you can expect, steak, chicken, ribs, etc. Pretty typical American food. I've only ever eaten steak here as I'm hesitant of any chain ribs. I am from Memphis after all. The steaks I've had were all cooked well and meat was pretty darn tasty. They do have some healthy side options and you can get all your food cooked without butter and oil, so I LOVE that since typically chain restaurants have some pretty unhealthy food. 

The atmosphere is pretty quiet and darker. I have to say the prices are pretty reasonable. For the area this is one of the better options and I'm sure you will find me at the bar sometime in the future having a little wine and a steak."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about going to this location, PLEASE RECONSIDER!

Normally I dont write reviews, good or bad, but felt that after my experience last night, I had to say something.

First off, me and my family, 5 people, went to this location to celebrate a family members promotion. Normally we have had ok experiences at Tony Roma's, but this ended up beyond bad. First, the waitress was very scatterbrained. Every time we would order a drink, beyond our first round, it took at least 10 minutes to get. My first drink (vodka cranberry) was watered down with soda water and tasted like water with an after taste of cranberry. She rarely came to check on the table and when she did, she was distracted.

It took almost an hour to receive our food. All 5 meals came out at best luke warm. My pulled pork sandwich was so cold that it felt like it had come out of the fridge and put on my plate. We then asked to speak to a manager. One manager came over, we told her the issue and she pretty much walked away. Then another manager came over and we told him the same thing and was met with very little sympathy and just an offer to remake our food. Thankfully, my 3mo old nephew was sleeping so we could afford to wait. 2 of my family decided to keep their meals (ribs) as they were at least luke warm and they didn't want to wait for new ones to be made. Only at that time did the manager say that he would take those 2 meals off the bill, but he seemed to make it VERY clear that the only reason why he was willing to do that was because they were willing to eat luke warm food and not get it remade. Replacements came out quickly and hot (you could tell that they were freshly remade) but still received very little sympathy from the manager. While we were waiting for our remade food, I asked the waitress for another drink. After 10 minutes of waiting for that drink (after we had already had to send back our food), I asked the manager to get me the drink as the waitress still hadn't brought it.

After everyone finished our meals, the bill was brought to us. The manager had removed the 2 meals as he stated but no discounts given to the rest of the meal. Also, this was 2 for 1 appetizers (we had ordered 3). All 3 were charged at regular price. When we went to discuss this with the manager, he argued with us for at least 5 minutes that only certain appetizers were 2 for 1 (their blackboard at the front did not mention this, only 2 for 1 and nothing was said to us by the waitress). After arguing with us and getting to the point that other people were starting to take notice in the restaurant, the manager finally agreed to give us a discount on them, but did it VERY begrudgingly. 

The icing on the cake was that while cleaning off the plates, the waitress dropped a rib bone and several fries on the ground. She had full hands so didn't clean it up right then and there. However, 10 minutes later and with the waitress walking by it at least 3 more times, it was still on the ground. It wasn't until we pointed it out to the manager that it was cleaned up by him. 

While we were upset about the cold food, what really, really upset all of us was that there was no sense of customer service by either our waitress or the manager even after we had complained. 

We will NEVER return to this location again and I doubt I will ever go to or order from Tony Roma's in the future. Cold food is something we can deal with, complete and utter lack of customer service is NOT!!!!"}
{"text":"Ribs were good, steaks were way overcooked.  Sides were ok. Service was lacking,  though the waitress was ok. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was back in town recently and Robin was still tending the lunch bar.  Again the mahi pasta and steak were outstanding.  The salmon and shrimp were also excellent!  Service was outstanding and price-points were fair.  I've got no complaints and will continue to frequent this establishment when I am in town!!  Nice job!"}
{"text":"Once a great place now a shadow of what it was. They no longer have beef ribs only pork other than that the food is basic and just OK. Loud and rowdy like a college bar. Won't be back."}
{"text":"You know, I'm REALLY not a fan of big chain restaurants, but while strolling Fremont Street, we got hungry and were lured in by the $11.99 steak and lobster special (only available after 9 pm).  I didn't go into the experience with very high expectations but came out pleasantly surprised.
It was 9 pm,  and we still waited about 25 minutes for a table as the place was very busy.   You don't get a pager or anything, they don't bother to take your name, but rather give you a paper number (like you get at a busy bakery).  They skipped us, but when we brought it to their attention a few minutes later, they apologized and sat us immediately.  
The food came out almost faster than our wine from the busy bar, and as I said before, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting a hockey-puck steak and a rubber piece of lobster, neither was the case.  I ordered my steak medium-rare, it came out more medium but not big deal (my dinner companion also ordered medium-rare, and his was perfect).  The lobster was cooked perfectly and was a decent sized tail.  All of that came accompanied with a baked potato and mixed vegetables (they were frozen, machine chopped mixture of peas and carrots  liked you'd buy in a grocery store).
Overall, for a late night snack that's more than a burger or hotdog, it was worth it.  Just don't go into it with huge expectations and you'll have a memorable experience.  This place turns out food like a factory, keep that in mind and you'll find it to be alright too."}
{"text":"$11.99 steak and lobster after 9pm... everyone at the table ordered it and we got it in like 10 minutes so you know they just had a ton sitting in the kitchen under a heat lamp.  You could tell from the food too.  But hey, for that price I'm fine with it.  The server hated that we all brought in our $2 Coronas from the bar outside but whatever.  After all those beers the special tasted amazing, haha.    

Prepare for a long wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I stay at The Fremont hotel every March when we come see The Mint 400 race. We love coming here to eat! Especially for steak and lobster! The lobster is a perfect size and the steak is always cooked as we ask it to be. It's only offered between 9pm-11pm so I recommend getting there by 8:30 and they'll take you to your table by 8:45. We ordered and our meal was out by 9:15. We enjoyed it all! Our server was nice and sweet too. Our meal came out to $25!! It was also our two year wedding anniversary so it was nice to have a enjoyable meal together."}
{"text":"Went in at 6pm with five people.  We were told there was a 20-30 minute wait.  Saod OK.  looked around and counted six empty tables.  We were the only ones waiting.  Asked hostess if we could sit at any of the empty tables and she said no.  i asked \"why not?\"  

She replied that the manager told her not to seat anyone else for half  an hour as they  werre too busy!!

We went to Famous Daves down the street."}
{"text":"Shitty service the 11.99 lobster and steak taste like rubber the steak had more fat then meat on it the steak was long and paper thin in like the picture the waiter was rude and never filled our drinks back up waited over 30 min and their where many empty seats WTf how are they still in business"}
{"text":"I was gambling in the casino and seen the sign of great price for prime rib and lobster. Did not wait too long for table; less than 10 minutes. It was worth it. DELICIOUS dinner for great price. I will be back next month."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was excellent! Our server, Susan, was very attentive and friendly.  We've eaten here before and have always had excellent service."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 1 star rating for a food establishment, but Tony Roma's begged for this review.  The hostess was great.  That's where the compliments stop.  We were greeted by a very nice server.  We took our time perusing the menu since we don't eat meat.  For vegetarians or pescatarians, they don't have an extensive list of offerings.  We settled on ordering from their 3-2-1 for $25 (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts).  We had the Full Onion for an appetizer.  I thought it was a greasy mess.   I thought it was weird that it came with BBQ sauce for dipping, but it was good.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi pasta and my partner ordered their Burger without the meat.  The Scampi dish was kinda weird because normally it doesn't come with tomatoes.  It came with tons of diced tomatoes!  I was fairly surprised.   Since my partner ordered a meatless burger, it was somewhat lackluster.  Then came the dreadful dessert.  I ordered the Red Velvet and my partner ordered the Key Lime Pie.  When we got our desserts, we both were very disappointed.  I was appalled with their presentation with the Red Velvet cake.  The frosting looked like it was just dropped on the top and it was messy.   My partners Key Lime Pie was very sad also.  The pie filling was more of a custard.  It was weird to see the filling so runny.  If the food wasn't enough, the service was just bad.  She was sweet but her timing with the foods needs a lot of work.  When we finally ordered the 3 course meal up front, it took 15 minutes for the appetizer to come.  After we were done with that, it took an additional 20 minutes for the entrees to arrive.  She actually asked us what we wanted for dessert when we already told her what we wanted over 30 minutes ago!  After she remembered what we ordered, it took 10 minutes to get there.  When we finished, she was taking her sweet time to punch in our check and we waited about 10-15 minutes after we finished dessert.  I was ready to leave a penny but my partner said she was ok so we gave the customary 20% gratuity.  As I have said before, eating out needs two components to be a good experience:  great service and good food.  This dinner lacked both.  I should've insisted we just went home to eat frozen dinners.  It would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Though I enjoy supporting small businesses I think franchise businesses need love too, it can't be all about small businesses.  But for real I am a fan of this Tony Roma's because the crew gave me exceptional service from beginning to end. I was surprised by the hostess opening the door, smiling, and greeting me when I came in, conversing, some places does this but I really felt welcomed and that it was meant. I was here to redeem my free entree birthday coupon and they took it even though it was for the Henderson location awesome saved me trip.  The server was on his A game. I kind of gave him the impression that it was my first time to Tony Roma's cause when he asked \"is it your first time to Tony Roma's\" I did say yes. I'm a yes man FYI I don't listen I usually nod and agree with people force of habit. But he did give me a very good impression, one that if I was really a first timer I would be back.  Very politely and proudly explained the menu, give his recommendations, of course I just ordered what he recommended. As I was eating checked the staff checked on me enough times.  When I was finished he suggested desserts, which I got. When I left I got the bye and thanks you for coming.  Service was way up there, Tony Roma's never fails.

Food is good if you've had Tony Roma's before, I just wanted to highlight their excellent service. But just in case you wanted to know what I ate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tony-romas-las-vegas-4?userid=vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew#mDPvi8GBjXC53-rbMUCd9w  and  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tony-romas-las-vegas-4?userid=vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew#tY7lJFydLiSYDMETb5A76g The interior was not new but clean and maintained. Two older flat screens not in the best locations, I couldn't see much of the NFL playoff game. It was less than half full for a weekend, so I think they need love.

AYCE ribs on Mondays you might find me here one day."}
{"text":"Ordered hot wings appetizer- Moderately spicy hot, wings on the smaller size.

Small Blue cheese wedge - thought it would come with blue cheese, but it had bacon and chopped tomatoes on it. Didn't love it, but the lettuce was crisp.

1 bacon jack hamburger - adequate, but not memorable. 

Just drank water.

Bill was $25 dollars"}
{"text":"Tony Roma's isn't like it use to be.  there was a wait but not long at all. 
The protions  seem a little small and the taste is just ok.  The waiter did his best to accomodate everyone.  there's a lot of people that seem to come to this Tony Roma's since it is Downtown Fremont Expereince area. . So we were pretty packed in."}
{"text":"We had such a great dinner and Kory was our waitress. She rocked it for us. We had 6 or 7 of us. She worked with all of us and our separate checks. She offered us all of these yummy appetizers and even made us a special sort of thousand island dressing since they don't actually have t.i. dressing.  Loved the desserts she recommended and the cocktails she recommended, too.  We had a great family dinner and it was so amazing thanks to our server, Kory."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to tony Roma's on Fremont Street.  In my opinion, it's a value hard to find on the Vegas Strip and the customer service was simply awesome!

Everything from the appetizers ( Onlon Loaf and Spinach Artichoke dip ) were excellent!  The $11.99 dinner of Steak and Lobster were perfectly cooked and portioned.  They tasted excellent!  The margaritas were yummy and hit the spot!

It's a little bit of wait, but it is well worth it!

Our waitress was funny, amusing, personable, and excellent in attending to our needs."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. It was really packed and stuffy inside but we came for the ribs and left satisfied"}
{"text":"Sign up for their birthday club ahead of time. They'll usually send you a coupon for a dessert or onion loaf and another for a free entree which you don't have to buy anything.

Tony Roma's is known for their ribs. And I do love their ribs, their BBQ sauces aren't that bad also.  I've been to two other locations around town and so far this is the only location I've always had excellent service. Whenever I go to this location and use my free entree coupon they'll treat me like a regular customer, friendly and often checked on me.  One time they gave me a free bottle of their BBQ sauce. Another time they hooked it up, only suppose to get a free entree, but got everything covered drinks, soups, desserts, and our meals.  At two other locations I was placed in the corner or away from everyone and not checked on so often.

If you're not sure what to order I recommend the St Louis ribs sampler.  They'll give you a full rack of ribs and a variety of their BBQ sauces. That's if you want ribs.  But they also have a pretty good chicken salad.

Spacious dining area.  I like seating toward the bar area right behind the hostess counter so I can also watch some TV.

I don't know if they still have their Tuesday AYCE ribs."}
{"text":"Went for the Prime Rib special, $8.99 from 4:30-630pm.  Had no wait, got seated and order taken.  About 5 minutes later, our meal was served.  A decent slice of prime rib, a baked potato and a spoonful of frozen mixed veggies.  For the price, it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Deaf in my ears from leaving Ranchman's regarding a charity event and a rumblin' in my tummy - I had not eaten all day as per usual. So we hopped on over across the street to Tony Romas before the kitchen closed down (11pm) and in we went. Only us and the crickets at the hostess stand and I was afraid all the chefs would be PISSED that they would have to cook for 2 more customers. The server finally came by and we were seated in a booth. We noted that this location on line had a low rating both on Yelp and Urban Spoon. However, I had a hankering for ribs and a $25 gift card burning in my pocket. The atmosphere, ya, I have to admit, BLAND as one reviewer said, for sure. And the music, again (just like the Keg in one of my past reviews), the satellite music that just blares out one hit wonder 80's tunes and not good ones at that.  Awful, so the place loses an entire star just on that. Cheri was our server and she was delightful. Nice gal. I saw that the Caesars were on special so I had one of those, extra, extra hot and hubby ordered his usual draft beer. Fri nights the Caesars are on for $5.50 for 1 oz. I ordered the half rack of ribs with garlic mashed and the broccoli. I always cringe when I order broccoli as you never know if you will get it raw, wilted or just nasty/old/soggy. Also ordered was a hamburger, just the house classic. Both meals took a bit but it was worth the wait. Great portion sizes, nice ribs with my sauce on the side, hot potatoes for a change and wonderfully steamed broccoli! Impressed! The burger looked good too, so full o' stuff that it fell apart after 3 bites! The fries upgraded for $2 to yam fries was a stellar move. So crispy, obviously made to order and deelish! Giant server of those!
So as I am eating, I remembered that I had this free dessert coupon from a Tony Romas in Ontario. What the hell! I will ask! Cheri checked with her manager and the coupon did not apply as we were in another province BUT she advised that her manager wanted to congratulate us on our 6 month anniversary and that he would like to buy us dessert! How nice! We ate our meals, had some left over to take home and then we dove into the mud pie dessert. 1 -2- 3- GO! 
Oh God, it was good! Settling up was a breeze and we left happy and full, closing the place down as we so often do!
It was a convenient place to come and I would come back if friends asked to meet here. I would not go out of my way to come here as it is far from home but other than the music and the fact that it has that typical chain restaurant feel, I really do not have a bad thing to say about it. I am still full and satisfied hours later!"}
{"text":"I had Christmas Eve dinner here with my parents. I'm not a huge fan of chains, but that's where my dad wanted to go.

Both of my parents ordered the soup of the day which was lobster bisque. I tried a bite and it was decent, kind of rich.  3/5

My dad ordered a full rack of baby back ribs. They were very, very tender and good. I wasn't in the mood for ribs, but after I tried his I wished I'd ordered the ribs. 4/5

For sides my dad had cole slaw (fine 3/5) and ranch beans (kinda sweet, okay 2.5/5).

I had the salmon and shrimp picatta. It okay, but I wouldn't order it again. I didn't care for how the salmon was prepared and the sauce wasn't very flavorful. 2/5

For sides I had rice pilaf (good, nothing special 3/5) and creamed spinach (would not order again, didn't taste good and a major disappointment since it was listed as a \"premium side\" 1/5).

My mom ordered the fillet medallions with bleu cheese and wild mushroom topping. They were fine but certainly nothing to get excited about. 2/5

She had the loaded mashed potatoes. They were pretty good and were the best of the sides that we tried. 3.5/5

The service was not great (2/5). The waitress was overly chatty and seemed kind of flustered or something. Also, she kept fanning herself when she took our order and told us she was having hot flashes, which I didn't really need to know. 

Overall, 2.5/5.  The only thing that was really good was the ribs. Of course, that's what they're known for. Definitely recommend getting the ribs if you go here. Everything else, meh."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. Place was pretty busy. Unfortunately, I will never come to Tony Roma's again. This place is a joke. From the hostess handing and calling out numbers like a deli counter, to the extremely unprofessional, rude and stupid waiter, this was horrible. Felt completely rushed. The waiter had no interest in serving us and probably just wanted my money. Well, sorry deuschbag, but if you cannot give me good customer service, you aren't getting shit!! Left him $1.00 tip. Yep, no joke. And the food?? Umm, I can make myself a better steak dinner at home. The waiter didn't greet us properly, didn't check back with us after we got our food and seemed like he was in an absolute rush to get to the next table. Such a waste of $25."}
{"text":"Service was acceptable, but they didn't give us a bread basket. Prices were moderate for Vegas. My dinner was a dare for me (pan-seared sesame encrusted fish), but I enjoyed it very much. 

Don't get suckered into the steak and lobster meal for $11.99. It's not worth the wait and the hassle. If you want good surf and turf, shell out the $20 or more for it and don't deal with so much trouble. 

I'm really glad I went once, but I'm not sure if I'll go back. I'll probably try a new place next time."}
{"text":"It was late, like 10:30 ish...on the waiting list.  The only thing I got was a baked potato.  And it was ok.  Could have been hotter."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day with co-workers.  The service was prompt and good.  However, the food and food preparation leaves much to be desired.  The $8 lunch special I ordered was smoked brisket in Tony Roma's sauce.  The brisket was very fatty (about 30 to 40%% fat) and the meat itself was low grade.  The cut was very thin and its value was nowhere near the price. 

Tony Roma's strict rules did not allow me to substitute the cole slaw (some rule about it being a garnish) and substituting some sides for the standard side cost extra.  I felt like I was being nickel and dimed on a fairly pricey lunch special.

In addition, it took a long time to get our food.  The only decent looking meal in our group was the ribs.  I will not return to Tony Roma's as the fairly expensive prices do not match the quality or quantity of food served.  I'd rather support a local enterepeneur who cares about their product than this overpriced corporate chain."}
{"text":"So that's my first time to review in Yelp?The only star is for the foods?The reason why I want to say something here is because the service?Well?U guys just don't respect Asian people?We came earlier than the other table about half hour and they foods were came faster than us?That fine but can u guys get some efficiency in ur customer service?When I ask the check I need to talk to 3 different people and wait half hour?And the other table who come later than us when they ask the check and the check just came soon and finally our checks was came together?Well?I am the easy person and I still put 20% tips before I go?But just wanna said I will never come back to this restaurant?Because I feel they racism?"}
{"text":"Disappointed. One of my favorite things to eat here is the sourdough bread with garlic butter and this tony romas didn't offer it. Not only did they not offer it but the server had no idea what it even was. He said he never heard of it. Sometimes it's the little things that counts. The place was overly loud especially by this one group of folks that were drunk. No one wanted to say anything. When I got outside I heard other customers complaining how they couldn't wait to get out because it was so loud. Just sad. Food was just \"ok\"."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 0 star... From the minute you walk in the hostess is rude the bartender Kim was even ruder... The food is less than 0 stars... Not sure how they can put the name Tony Roma's on this junk ...."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and now the ribs are way too spicy and I asked for sauce that wasn't spicy. Plus the Broccoli was like Mush way overcooked and the baked potato was bad too.... even the free cheesecake was lousy. Never again and shame on them!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Tony Roma's. I went with a group of 8 adults and three kids under 3 years of age. The waiter was very accommodating and even asked us if we wanted to put the birthday cake we had brought in the fridge (and later provided plates and cutlery for the cake and even brought the cake out with the candles lit). The food was great and nice young waiter was very attentive. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I was craving Tony Romas...so off we went, fond memories intact. Then reality set in. 1.) they changed the menu since I'd been there (more than a year had passed) and I wasn't happy to see my favorites gone. However I picked a burger, and we had an onion loaf. They no longer keep sauces on the table and the waiter seemed annoyed when we asked for a selection of sauces. This used to be one of the best parts of the visits for me, the tasty sauces! He brought little samples and they were as good as they used to be, unfortunate that they no longer put them table side. 

The food was a bit below average, the quality, taste and temp was a bit off. The service was slow and distracted which seemed odd considering only a some handful of customers were there.  The check took about 30 minutes to arrive, that was after we were totally done and the plates were cleared. He knew we were done yet he went missing for 30 minutes.

I can only speak to the quality of the burgers, onion loafs and sauces...however this once fantastic place has gone down hill and is no longer worth the money or time."}
{"text":"stood at the desk and was 'professuinally' ignored so we left & no one noticed - it was 1:--pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"Tony Roma's isn't an amazing place.  You'll find much better rib joints around.  It's just a typical chain with typical chain food and chain food decor and service.  Nothing offensive, but nothing great either.

The thing that kicks Tony Roma's over the 3-star line are the freakin' onion loaves.  Literal, giant loaves of lightly breaded and fried sweet onions that you can then dredge in your choice of sauce.  I like my stuff sweet, so I go for the Carolina Honeys and it's awesome, but they have other tangier choices available.

One thing that our pals from down south or out east should know:  This ain't bbq like you're used to.  This is thick, sweet sauce bbq."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a good while now,me and my grandpa finally came here for lunch today.I was most excited to see that they had a onion loaf becuase I love onion strings/rings what ever.So we decided to get a full rack of baby back ribs with the sweet sause its caralina something,it came with two sides we got fries,and mac and cheese,and for a appitizer we got the onion loaf.

Bread-They bring you a bread basket thing out with this creepy looken butter,do think its gross by the look because its not! It was very good and it went well with the crispy bread.

Onion loaf-They are the white sweet onions wich are my favorite and they were sweet and crunch,just enough batter and it made them taste very good.In the middle of them is the original bbq sause wich is good,but I asked the girl if I could have some ranch.I liked her becuase she said how after work she would take some home becuase that was her favoirte ranch to eat,it made me laugh.

Fries-they came on the same plate as the ribs and they were standard but very good,crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside.I dipped them in the hottest sause and in the ranch it was yummy.

Mac & cheese-It had little sprinkles of bacon on top of it wich gave it more flavor and good texture.This is the kind of mac and cheese I enjoy the cheese is still gooy and hot and the noodles arnt to soft just right :)

RIBS-This is realy what youve been waiting to read about isnt it?Ok well im going to start off by saying im defently getting these again.Personaly I think these are the best ribs ive ever eaten.They wernt fatty and they have very very good flavor,im happy i got the sweet bbq sause with it it complimented the meat well.There not the meatiest ribs in the world but you dont have to fight your way through a bunch of fat eather,wich I think is great.

{"text":"All we wanted with my friends that night was ribs. We didn't care about the atmosphere of the restaurant (which is non existant whatsoever), we didn't care about the service, we wanted to eat ribs, that was pretty much it. We had them and it was really good. Very tender and tasty. The service is not top notch but our waitress did a nice job keeping our cocktails glasses full. An overall good experience."}
{"text":"No wonder the bad yelp reviews I just got turned away by the manager Stephanie Benson. She is not taking reservations and she's telling everyone that she's fully booked even though I just walked in and I saw eight open tables. I've worked in a restaurant before I know what she's trying to do.  I know she's trying to go home on time but it's definitely bad for business. She is very unapologetic and definitely needs retraining. Bad service from a manager lets me know the attitude around here."}
{"text":"This is not the Romas I remember. 
The service was poor to start.  The waiter forgot our order for the onion loaf, when he brought our dinner I inquired if we were going to receive the onion loaf at all.  Hubs had the steakhouse burger (the sauce provided was a congealed coagulated brown gravy).  But he says the burger was a 2 star. I had the sirloin steak and mashed potatoes. My steak was ordered medium, it was served well...really well. I sent it back and again requested medium, it was served rare. I declined to have it re-fired since the cooks cook only two temps.  Our onion came while I was waiting for my refire, the onion is cut a lot thicker than I remember, but it was still ok. The hubs had to remind the waiter about our dessert, which was a soggy apple tart - the ice cream was good.  When the bill arrived the onion loaf was still on the bill, even though it was supposed to have been complimentary.  I didn't argue at this point - we just wanted to get out of there. The hubs says, \"Tony Romas is worse that Sizzler\"....ouch."}
{"text":"I think about this place and am reminded of being almost 17 and discussing the all important prom details here. 

If you like your ribs with a healthy serving of strip mall cheesy goodness on the side, this is your spot. Look no further!"}
{"text":"I've loved the service here for decades. You can't beat the $11.99 steak and lobster deal. Pro tip, grab a $3 beer at the casino bar just outside the restaurant to enjoy while you wait for them to call your number. You can hear your number though out the casino so feel free to find a lucky machine."}
{"text":"we were downtown and looking for somewhere to eat.  it didn't look too bad from the bar, but when we sat down (saturday night) we were seated within arms length of another couple....  the service was in a close tie for the worst service we have EVER had.  the food was ok.. not great.... we felt a little ripped off that we wasted one of our vegas dinners at tony romas... definately not a nice dinner.  

the only part i enjoyed was the baked potatoe soup - absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Tony Roma's since I've been in highschool!

Of course this location is the closet to me.  Staff was very friendly.  I've notice when I do eat here its usually a weekday when its slow.  Not sure what the weekend is like.

THEY GOT A GREAT DEAL!  HALF BABY RACK FOR LUNCH MON THRU FRI? FOR $9!

Haven't been here for...maybe a year?

They have new sides:  mac and cheese (it was okay taste like cheese whiz, but my bacon was burnt) and creme spinach taste like spinach dip."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week for lunch.  We always use Amy.  I love this place and love their lunch specials.  I feel the server does make a difference but the food is superb.  We still get our salads like they made it 5 years ago and the ice tea is freshly brewed.  If you go there just ask for Amy's Section and tell her you saw my post on Yelp and i know she will take care of you."}
{"text":"The ribs were smaller than we remembered. The salmon and shrimp was a little dry and needed more of the sauce. They were busy but the service was fine. We saw the prime rib special and it looked really thin. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Well the first time I went it was great but this time the food seemed very gmo. Very nice microwave food is the best I can put it. I think because the demand is so high they just need to get people in and out. The prices are fair and if your drunk from freemont partying, the food will eat the spot. Sober...well you may notice that everything that glitters isnt gold here."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, which isn't much to be honest.  We expected a lot more restaurant choices for Fremont Street but there really isn't.  What restaurants there are are INSIDE the casinos so it's a pain just to find one.

We settled on Tony Roma's because it wasn't too expensive and we really just wanted to eat.  The host told us 30 minutes even though half the restaurant was empty.  They page the numbers overhead so you can go wander in the casino and not worry about missing being called.  We didn't have to wait 30 minutes, so I guess they were just playing it safe.

One server brought us water and silverware, but then our actual waiter didn't show up for about 5 minutes.  Asked for recommendations for drink selections, he wasn't very helpful.

When you're at what you think is a nice sit down restaurant and they give you mayonnaise in a packet you should turn around and leave.

Food came out quickly but again, you get what you pay for.  I've had better food at TGIFriday's or Olive Garden.  I ordered the \"Cheesy Burger\" which had 3 or 4 different types of cheese and it was fine, nothing spectacular.  In fact there was almost too much cheese, and for a girl from Wisconsin it takes a lot for me to complain about too much cheese.  I could barely taste the burger.  Also I asked for no tomatoes and got tomatoes.  Fries were standard, nothing special.  My husband ordered some type of chicken sandwich with Jack Daniel's sauce.  


When we were done we had to wait almost 15 minutes for our check.  Honestly, you can do better than Tony Roma's.  If you're okay settling for moderate food and a moderate price then go here.  Otherwise go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This place should be closed!
I took a girlfriend there...I was very hesitate as the casino itself looks cruddy. My friend ordered the steak and lobster for $11.99, the waiter told us the deal started at 9pm...we needed to wait another 15 min. We ordered the kickin shrimp...it was soggy and looked disgusting. We sent it back.  Then some Maxwell Smart looking dude came to our table...not to discuss the shrimp order we returned but to inform us we could not be seated before 9pm to order the lobster special. We got that resolved by the manager. My friends steak which was ordered medium rare was well done. That was returned to get the same thing. Finally, she said she would try to eat it...we just wanted to leave.  As she was cutting this dry tough steak, it flared to the ground.  You do NOT want to go here"}
{"text":"The only reason why I come here is for the daily prime rib special from 4:30-6:30 and the steak and lobster special from 9-11pm. The specials are a great value for the price. There usually is a line before it opens but the service is quick. If you're in the mood for a quick meal in downtown Las Vegas hit up Tony Romas"}
{"text":"Wow!  I am baffled by the lack of customer service.  Restaurants are a food/customer oriented business.  We were given a number and was informed it would be a 30-35 minute wait.  We checked back in with the host after 25 minutes and was informed that they've stopped serving.  Why an establishment would say the wait is 30 -35 minutes and not offer service is baffling.  If you want to waste your time waiting for a table, this place is for you.  Otherwise, I'd recommend a Mcdonald's.  They have better customer service."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed as we had tried the Edmonton location at Calgary trail and were fairly impressed.  
We should have suspected when we pulled into the almost empty parking lot but we were still willing to give it a chance. 
NY steak meh.
Mahi Mahi pasta meh
St. Louis ribs meh
Bountiful ribs slightly better than meh.
For the price, really not even meh.  I
We will continue our search for ribs elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was on the poor side of mediocre, mostly due to lack of service. Just when we were about to just leave because no waiter had come to our table for 20 minutes, he shows up... And he visited the table twice more to give us our food and our check. The food was alright; everything was just a little overlooked and dry, though the prime rib was fine and a decent deal at $8.99 for their happy hour."}

The food was awesome and service was even better. Thank you Jessica"}
{"text":"Worse experience ever at this restaurant.  I was given a number and was told the wait was an hour, this was around 9pm.  I was there with 3 small children & my grand mother.  Obviously they give numbers without taking into consideration how many people they can actually serve until 11pm.  By 10:30 pm I was told 15 mins more.  At 11pm they said they are over booked and they could not serve us.  My kids & grandmother were starving.  Then when I approached the manager Brooke he was very uncaring and unprofessional about the whole situation.  He had nothing else to say but just rolled his eyes at us.  I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"This place is great. I eat here all the time. The food is always tasty and the service is fast and friendly. I recently had a company event catered here and everyone ate good and enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff showed us some great hospitality and we all enjoyed our evening together. The baby back ribs fall off the bone and the steaks are just as delicious. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family:)"}
{"text":"Crazy line for the 9-11 o'clock $11.99 Steak and lobster dinner! Served with mixed veggies and a baked potato undressed but with sour cream chive blend on the side as an option. The steak was satisfactory and the lobster was a decent size. Great bang for the buck. The atmosphere is a little crowed but moderately noisy. I was lucky to get a booth for a party of 2. Most were seated in an array of center tables. I liked that I sat in a booth in the back :) service was pretty quick but slight attitude.. It's Vegas tho, waiters are prob sick of redundantly serving demanding obese tourists lol
Def accommodating to very large groups"}
{"text":"This place was horrible, I had never been before but had heard good things from a friend. My boyfriend asked me to have dinner with him here and I was pretty thrilled. Long story short, this place is way overpriced for the food quality and service. I think going to applebees, TGIF, outback, etc are way better and cheaper. Every thing my boyfriend asked for as a side for his entree they were out of it, so he had to settle for other crap. Come on now, the amount of things this place was out of was ridiculous! It's a restaurant. Shouldn't they stock up? It's not like it was out of season, it was vegetables! Definitely will not be going here ever again and I don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Last week my girlfriend got her birthday card from Tony R's in the mail and she just had to use it.  I agreed to join her because no one else would!   I was a huge fan of Tony  R's for years and keep hoping (because we do go there yearly to use my gf's b'day cards)  that they would upgrade the NE Location.  Nope.  Same, aging decor,  same outdated carpet, and now the silvering is coming off the forks!  Kid you not, my gf's fork had leprosy and I traded her because I got camping in the woods and I've seen worse.     
And how is the food you ask?

Mediocre.   The pulled chicken sandwich was so soaked in barbeque sauce it  was impossible to handle, and it could have been pulled mystery meat for all I knew, as all I could taste was sauce, sauce and more sauce.  The coleslaw swimming in dressing was equally as messy, but the fries were pretty good.  

I like the prices on their new value menu,  but my gf's steak sandwich was more bread than steak and served with the same slaw  and fries as mine.  She said her steak was okay.

The service was good.  I like that our waitress took time to chat  with us.

Will I go there again?   If that darned birthday card shows up in the mail again, yeah, I guess so.  I'll  probably end up trying all the value meals, because, quite frankly I have hope.  When the food fails to live up to the pictures ... there is always hope."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time, I got my meal free on a comp, but I would NOT pay for the food.  Drinks are good, and the ribs are NOT BAD, but dont order anything else if you go."}
{"text":"new year we eat here not a very pleasant restaurant the appetizer was good but the entrees not to good rice was super salty no good no good, no good. that nite or morning was puking and hubby and sis-in law too so we spend new years in bed all day not a pleasant thing to do while in vacation"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Tony Roma's in a long time as the location in our home town shut down decades ago. 

No wonder. 

Baby Back ribs were overcooked and dry and the sauce (I didn't get a choice, just one option) was overly sweet and didn't have a kick. 

At least they did bring the extra butter, REAL butter, I asked for for my baked potatoe. The coleslaw was ho-hum. 

Service was adequate as the place was hopping busy. Not worth the price IMHO. I've had way better BBQ for less $$$."}
{"text":"OK, it's OK, but' I'd rather give 2.5 stars instead of 3.

We got a coupon in the mail - buy one entree and get the second one for free.  Now I knew this wasn't going to be some 5 star eatery, so I take it for what it's worth.

It's a chain franchise that makes OK to decent food.  It's not going to blow you away unless you've never had a great steak or ribs or fish.  I mean like if you are from some place where your best meal choice is Applebee's then you probably consider this a topnotch steak or rib house.

Yeah, but it's not.  It is what it is, a simple chain style joint that offers like I said OK food.  The place is clean, the service was good till it got a bit backed up, but I can't complain and the food was alright.  At least my steak was alright, but my wife had the Mahi-Mahi (is that how you spell it???)  and it was a bit tough and too dry.

The sides were OK but the appetizer onion loaf was way too greasy.

You know the coolest thing about this place?  It's the last place Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal ate before the \"boys\" put a bomb under his car and tried to blow him to kingdom come.   I mean, what's not to like about a joint that still does have a historic connection to the old Vegas mob? http://www.lvrj.com/news/7387901.html

We won't be back unless they send another coupon, why, because, there are far better options that are more reasonable with a better quality of food.  But hey, that bomb thing in the parking lot, now that had to be cool!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that I was up $100, or that the meal was comped or all the beer I had just drank, but this was one of the best steak and shrimps I've ever had. Service was pretty good too. Well, at least until they kicked us out."}
{"text":"I have been there a couple of times and I absolutely loved it! I ordered one rack of back ribs with BBQ smoky sauce. They are great, soft flavour; I ordered them with garlic mashed potatoes and french fries; both have spices which makes them much more tasty.

Great place for ribs, totally recommended."}
{"text":"We came here with low expectations, after all we were here for the 4p-6:30p, $8.99 prime rib dinner special.  Located inside the Fremont Casino on Fremont Street of Las Vegas you can't not see the huge pictures boasting the $8.99 Prime Rib Special.  After 9pm you can get a $12.99 Steak and Lobster special, but that was way too late for our hungry tummies.

There was a small line at Tony Roma's and the hostess passed out paper ticket numbers instead of the traditional write your name on list.  Much to our surprise the hostess rattled off numbers faster than a machine gun, often calling 6 parties at once.  For a split second I thought what is this, are we all going to sit at a cafeteria style bench?  I guess TR's gets about 1000 customers a night so they are really set up be fast and efficient.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth.  Again much to our surprise our waitress was fast and friendly as well.  Furthermore the helpers clearing tables, getting drink refills and bringing out food were all fast and friendly something I really didn't expect on a blue light special meal.

Of course we ordered the prime rib which came with steamed veggies and a small baked potato.  The portions were good sized and tasty.  The night before we ate at Lawry's House of Prime Rib and although TR's prime rib is not comparable it was still moist, tender and flavorful. 

Although I wouldn't recommend Tony Roma's for any special occasions if you want a great deal on Prime Rib this is the spot to go."}
{"text":"Best beef ribs I've ever had. Always fast service at reasonable price, I have never left hungry or disappointed. Good parking, friendly service and their takeout is easy and reliable for last minute family get togethers. One of my favorite spots for sure."}
{"text":"We decided to try it again.  I think it has gotten worse.  The steak now is very flat/thin and the shape looked artificial. Reminded me of a steak in a cartoon. The lobster tail is still tiny.  The baked potato tasted burnt.  Total fail..."}
{"text":"Rudest service ever!  We didn't know part of our party had checked in prior to our arrival, the \"host\" rudely said \" I said 20 minutes and it's only been 10!!\"   There were 3 people at the hostess stand and each one was more rude!   We were a party of 11, Las Vegas locals, bringing tourists to dinner.  If you treat the locals like this, how are you treating the tourists.   

I guess it's a good thing our server Vanessa was great ( she deserves 5 stars). Food was ok"}
{"text":"Slow Service Mediocre Food and I had to ask for things like Horse Radish 2 or 3 times. By the times things were begrudgingly provided I had eaten the Prime Rib which was grey and very fatty and poorly cooked,baked potatoes were terrible and the broccoli was mushy sigh this is my last time here"}
{"text":"My 100th Review!!!

My 16 year old daughter and I went here a few weeks ago for some ribs. They were good...but nothing that would be featured on \"Pit Masters\". 

We shared a Caesar salad to start. My daughter had the Mac & Cheese and I had the potatoes. They were both good but nothing to right home to Momma about. 

3 solid starz for A-OK!"}
{"text":"Rolled in for a quick lunch on Black Friday. The bar was empty but the server was very attentive and right there to refill my beer. The lunch burger is well prepared and tasty. Not crazy about 9$ for burger n fries but the service and cleanliness of the facility makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know what folks get a big two star about? This is Vegas downtown and I have been to many Tony Roma's across the country. The Vegas Brand is a Loser Lounge, which acts as a restaurant for a good meal, drinks are great, but food needs a little imagination to go with it. Yea, a Lobster all the way from Maine and a low end section of the cow to make the most cheapest meal with the little bit of winnings you got left. I know after beating those Texans at the table they ain't gonna give me their best piece of meat?
I find the staff friendly but slow, there are a lot of Roma fans from all over the country and the advertised $11.99 is a way of gettin em in there! This is one of the few places in Vegas that does not serve Ice cube drinks (75% ice Cube-5% liquor). Downtown is loosing it's seediness and getting like 42nd street New York? So if you are one of the few to make it in for the $11.99 deal tack it up as a dinning experience :-)"}
{"text":"We ordered the afternoon prime rib special for 8.99.  But the meat quality is below average.  Service is also not up to standard.  Although the prime rib is good price, but I will prefer to pay a little more for better quality."}
{"text":"Actually a pretty good meal. Beef ribs  moist & tender. French fries were a waste of space so didn't eat them. The coleslaw was good as well. Been a long time since I've been to a TR. I think we'll be back. Very good service too"}
{"text":"A group of us came here specifically for the evening prime rib dinner specials (prime rib and surf and turf options). We got exactly what we wanted. The ribs came out cooked to order and of decent size and quality, accompanied by a baked potato and vegetable (in tonight's case, corn). These dinner specials also come out super-fast, and this is a really good option if you want a decent meal in a fast-food time frame.

The staff was very accommodating. We wanted to be sure we were seated before 6:30 when the specials ended, and not all of our party had arrived at the same time. They allowed those of us who were there to be seated to order while we waited for the rest of the group to arrive, and we continued to order drinks (good selection of basic beers) and dinners. In addition to the specials, people in our party who ordered other steaks or burgers were equally satisfied. One of our party members also had the misfortune of having some food spilled on him as a plate was being cleared. We were immediately given what felt like a lifetime supply of moist towelettes, and he was comped for dinner, so we were satisfied with how the incident was handled.

The desserts are surprisingly good. If you saved room, get the sampler so you can have 3. The only one I would not recommend is the cheesecake, which just didn't have the right creaminess and texture. All the others are delicious."}
{"text":"I should have known better to check Yelp reviews before I went but i was with work crew & they picked this place. Very crowded, standard corporate tasting meals. Most people seated around us where form out of state. (Me too) ha. Anyway, this is not a \"local stand out\"  restaurant. Attracts visitors more than anything is my guess. Still the food wasn't bad, just not great."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner. This place is so busy and we still got the proper attention by the wait staff. We don't have any here in Colorado anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the steak and lobster special - great value, and we enjoyed the meal. The steaks were juicy and tender. The lobster tail was small, but for $11.99 you can't expect much more. More reasonable than most restaurants on the strip. If you're at Fremont, consider a stop."}
{"text":"I'm always perplexed about coming to this restaurant. It's not like I don't know what the foods going to taste like, I know that I'll get unlimited soda [insert simulated gagging sounds here], I know the décor, and that mystical scent in the air. I suspect, that we always go back because of the service, really could there be any other reasons. OK, aside from the ribs, which I'm not sure if I've passed my phobia of touching my food. Yes, I said it, I said it on the Internet, I don't like touching my food. Anyhow, I suspect we always go back because of the service. The service? The service. For some reason, this restaurant gets it, from the front door to the kitchen and back again. It's strange and in all my years of observing these types of things, I would have never imagined it at Tony Roma's. Plus, we always have a good time laughing for some reason at the restaurant. Like the other night, where this overzealous waiter kept vacuuming the floor in the middle of dinner service using a busted battery powered vacuum. OK, so we asked him to stop twice, not once, twice. Are you kidding me? We made a joke about it when my friend ran out with one of the units pretending to vacuum, it was so funny and caused his brother to bolt from his chair ready to snag the unit from the person's hands not knowing it was his brother. Try Tony Roma's and you won't be disappointed, I really enjoy the soups and salads. Yes, I touch my food."}
{"text":"We wanted good ribs.... Where else right? 
The steak was done right.. we did have good, prompt service too.
The sauce on the ribs were terrible.  Good ribs in my opinion don't need a yucky, ketchup-ish sauce to cover them. Maybe its the fact that I hate ketchup on anything. Don't mind a good homemade like bbq sauce, but at this price the ribs should be respected enough to be real, good with very little substance to cover them. I was really missing a noticeable 'bark' on the ribs.                                                                                                                                                THE REAL REASON I LOVE RIBS.... is the BARK, this deep dark, rich, sweet, chewy, crusty, jerky-like rind suffused with incredible complex flavour leading to the melt own your mouth meat. TONY ROMA's KNOWLEDGE OF RIBS is POOR.                                                                Two dishes, two beers over $90.00 It would have been ok if the ribs were good. Im disappointed enough to never go back again."}
{"text":"No no. No no no..... turn back while you can... im visiting las vegas for a trip this was the first place we stopped for dinner after eating mcdonalds all day ugh..... anyways I wanted something good but I foolishly didn't read the reviews.. I was only attracted to the price abd you get what you pay for I had steak and lobster,obster was fine but steak potatoes were nasty and tough with no flavor I was shaking salt on my food with every bite also I asked for medium rare they gave me rare a friend asked for medium well they gave her medium rare and another asked for well done and they gave her medium... maybe the lingo is different since I
 From maryland but overall didnt like it at all the kicken shrimpbasl had no flavor  it tasted like plain shrimp and the kixed vegatable looked like canned mixed vegis but now that I think about it most of the food seemed like the microwave kinds seriously wondering if theres an actual kitchen in that place or just a George forman grill"}
{"text":"So good. Haven't been here in 20 + years because they closed them all down in Vancouver's lower mainland. It's just as good as I remember. I had the Roma size strawberry colada drink and it was very reasonably priced at $6.50 . For dinner I had the steak medallions and ribs for $32. It was very large and filling . I had to share it with my husband. 2 steak medallions and ribs. I think I only ordered something with steak because I'm in cowtown. Next time I'm going for just straight ribs. The steak was fine. The ribs were better though."}
{"text":"\"This should be called Tony Roma's cafeteria.\" A direct quote from the birthday boy. We came here to celebrate my father's Birthday. The pulled pork was fatty, the steak was bland, the ribs tasted like they were boiled,  the Mac and cheese was runny. The turkey panini was one of the better dishes. The mashed potatoes were good and the service was great. To bad the food put a damper on everyone's mood."}
{"text":"The manager was so RUDE !!!!!!! People have been waiting for 30 minutes before closing and she turned us away and she said she couldn't give corporate phone number!!!!!!!! Unbelievable!!!!!! Bad customer service rude attitude and not good at all!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"WTF Tony?  Seriously, I used to love this place!  On a recent visit here, my ribs were dry, boney, and had very little meat.  No more deliciously flavored sauces at the table.  You get one \"coaster\" dish containing about half an ounce of sauce...I asked for 4.  Who doesn't love sauce with their ribs?  Their Hefeweizen beer is also WAY over priced.  Service was average, at best."}
{"text":"I've been here and ordered the ribs. They're pretty good. Nothing really stand out. The red velvet cake is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better."}
{"text":"Tony Roma's used to be one of my favorite spots as a teenager. Oh nostalgia...Where has the time gone? 

Unfortunately, a lot has changed for this restaurant since then, specifically now with their raised prices and smaller portions. Oh and can I mention that they don't offer the 4 different bbq sauces on the tables anymore? Just more of an inconvenience to have to ask the servers for it. I guess they're really trying to save costs, huh?

I came here last night and ordered the full slab of baby back ribs with a side of baked potato and rice (It's the only item that I order every time I dine here). Their baby back ribs glazed with their bbq sauce are freakin good and has always been freakin good. The ribs are so tender and juicy. However, I feel like their portions have been gradually decreasing over the years. And I'm confident to say that two full slabs today would make up a full slab back in the day along with cheaper prices. 

Sadly, due to a lot of their changes, I think they lost a lot of business. However, if I'm really craving baby back ribs which isn't very often these days, I will most likely end up coming back here."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a great guy from Boyd gaming hooking up a rack of ribs on the house!! The service was great. There was a line and we were sat immediately. I would definitely recommend if you're a carnivore. 
I ordered Babyback ribs and chicken combo. I guess I didn't read the menu thoroughly enough; but I was expecting a breast of chicken and got the leg and thigh. Not my favorite part of the bird. Without any problem or questions, the server had it switched out in minutes. Tony Roma's at Fremont Hotel truly made me feel like a king tonight at a time where I am over working myself and needed a great American style Hearty meal. Plus being downtown in a casino with SO MUCH history is pretty cool. I love having a close circle of friends. I want it to get larger! Come join me!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time my family and I ate at this particular Tony Roma's.  They were very busy for dinner and they hand out numbers.  It looked like we had an hour wait because of all the other people that were ahead of us.  Turns out, we only waited 25 minutes.  I was surprised at the amount of time we waited.  We ordered our food and it was only a 20 minute wait!  Well, there's a reason why the wait to be seated went by quickly and why we had our food ready quickly - it all tasted like S**T!! Tony Roma's probably (by the taste of things) had everything cooked and prepared by the time the dinner rush was to come in.  They probably just cooked a lot of ribs and other popular dishes well ahead of time and when customers ordered those dishes, they probably just heated it up.  We ordered ribs and french fries!  Our fries was cold - not room temperature...cold!  Our ribs were dried out with barely no BBQ sauce on it - I had to add the BBQ sauce that they had available on our table.  Save yourself some $$ and don't waste it here.  It was definitely not paying $20.99 for a full rack of ribs - this was the worst food I ever had at a restaurant.

I forgot to mention that our waitress was nice but the other workers like the bus person was rude.  He even stopped to cough at our table in front of our food without even covering his mouth or apologize!"}
{"text":"We were TR regulars in Winnipeg but this was the first time we had tried this location after moving to Calgary.
We ordered the same starters we always order.  The Calamari looked like it was bought in walmart and just heated in deep fat.  The onion loaf tasted weird, had an over riding flavour i could not put my finger on.  The pepsi I had and the 7up my daughter had was very syrupy in taste and texture.
We cancelled our main courses and offered to pay and leave.  The manager very graciously apologised for our disappointment and took no money.
I wouldn't return to this location after this experience but I do appreciate the manager's handling of our complaint.

We did leave this restaurant and drive to a different TR in McKenzie Town which was just what we expected except the Calamari was still not quite what we expected, but did taste much better than this location."}
{"text":"Came here after playing in the casino for a good minute. Appetizers were good.  Had the ribs, and they were delicious. it gets crowded but you have the option of leaving your name and play a Lil more at the tables. they call your number out over the intercom, so you don't miss it. 

Will definitely be back! Service was great. 

Bathrooms are located in the casino not the restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give this irresponsible establishment 0 stars I would!! We dined there 10/8/2016 at 7pm, these jerks fed my 3 year old Granddaughter EXPIRED gogurt. Sad thing is when we told one of the managers all he did was offer a new one. Really let me have another expired gogurt... no thanks! The other 2 Managers were useless as well. Chef at least threw away expired product but still does not rectify that my Granddaughter ate that & may get sick. Stay far away from these place!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished! Dang their ribs were great. I was pleasantly surprised! Great portions too!"}
{"text":"We try to go at least once a month since we have the camp card that gives a buy one get one free entree. Love their baby back ribs! The service is hit or miss depending on your server. I would have to say Danielle was our favorite out of the few we have had. See y'all soon!"}
{"text":"Look, you don't come here for fine dining. You come here because you can get $8.99 prime rib and $11.99 steak and lobster. I go once every time I visit Las Vegas. I know what to expect. The service sucks, there is almost always a wait, and the food isn't great. However, you are getting exactly what you are paying for. I recommend going to anyone who goes to Vegas; just don't have too high of expectations."}
{"text":"On October third, I received a comp off my b connected card. I figured since Roma's is a chain it would be safe. Ha! When we walked in it looked like no other romas ive ever been too. It looked worn down. It was full tho so, i figured maybe its good. Wrong. The only thing good was the ribs. We ate the meal ugh at the end they brought desert for my daughters bday. As she was eating it a ROACH crawled up to my daughters plate. We both screamed a man came over and killed it. The manager came and said \" sorry, we will tell the steward to spray...\"  Huh? I guess because it was a comp they didn't give a care. Let me tell you what. The food was disgusting and I could feel roaches crawling over me for days. What a memory for my kids birthday."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in early September 2015 for (what else?) the $11.99 steak and lobster special.

You have to wait 30-40 minutes to be seated, but IMHO that's likely put in place by the Fremont St. casino that's no doubt subsidizing the cost of a dinner literally 1/2 the price of anything else on Tony Roma's menu: \"Oh look, Gladys. It's gonna be 40 minutes before they seat us. What to do? Hmmm, these slot machines look like they might be fun...\" At any rate, downtown Vegas at night has plenty to do and see while you're waiting.

We got back to the restaurant's lobby (located DEEP in the casino) near the appointed time, waited a few minutes, and were seated. The waiter was friendly enough, and the food was pretty good: yes, the veggies were obviously the prepackaged frozen kind you can buy at any grocery store and the unwrapped baked potato is served without even being cut open, but this is what you get for $11.99 for steak and lobster, and neither is a deal-killer. The steak itself was tasty (if smallish), and the lobster was très yummy!

If you're looking for a late dinner for a great price (our total bill was less than $40, including drinks and tip, for a meal that would have cost $100 or more anywhere else in Vegas), this special is hard to beat. We're definitely going again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The $11.99 steak and lobster dinner is that cheap for a reason. You'll know why after your first bite. But hey, you're drunk anyway from all those drinks in the casino since you'll be waiting 30-40 mins for a table.

Service was mediocre. I can't imagine the servers here make much money with a bunch of cheap guests dining there."}
{"text":"The food was really good and it was a great experience.  A nice stop off Fremont Street.  It isn't on the strip, don't expect a strip type place.  I ordered the ribs and they were fantastic and fell off the bones.

I didn't leave hungry and the bartender was amazing, making the drinks really liquored up."}
{"text":"Food was decent , but the wait staff was extremely unprofessional as well as slow. Which is weird considering there was only 4 customers total in the restaurant and nearly 12 wait staff.   It took nearly 20 minutes to receive our drinks ( should have been a warning sign ).   We will probably never return.   This Tony Romas was nothing like the California ones im used to."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give NEGATIVE STARS I would. This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had. Here's what happened 

We show up to the restaurant with a party of 8. To our surprise we were sat immediately... Now we know why. We sat for about 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. Another 20 minutes rolled by and we still didn't have service. I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said \"I'm sure you do\" and turned around. Strike 1.

Our waitress finally arrived. She said \"what does everyone want to order\" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2

We ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3

We were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity. 

When we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say \"have a nice night\" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived . 

I will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return. 

PS I am a bartender downtown & will tell everyone I know to keep far as possible from this establishment."}
{"text":"Come on now people. This place is Tony Roma's but it's on Freemont Street. You don't go to Freemont Sreet for fine dining. If the place you're going to has a steak and lobster special, you're probably not gonna get a fancy meal. I got the steak and lobster special (of course), yes the steak is a little tough and yes, the veggies may have been previously frozen. My lobster happened to be cooked perfectly, juicy and tender. $11.99 people. Go to Mastro's if you need your food to get you all hot and bothered."}
{"text":"This is a fairly good option for lunch if you work downtown.

It might take a little more than just an hour, so if you work at a place that is very stringent about time, be warned.

It's pretty standard American fare - burgers, chicken dishes, pasta dishes, sandwiches, and some lunch-size portions of some of the dinner options (like the filet medallions which I do recommend).  Prices are fair too.

The service is usually really smooth.  Sometimes there is the need to remind a server for a beverage refill.  

Parking can sometimes be problematic as the private lot is shared with some shops and another restaurant.

All in all, a good option for lunch for those that work downtown."}
{"text":"NEVER again... I ordered prime rib medium and it was beyond  WELL done and cold.  The ribs tasted like they had been boiled. My baked potato was about the only thing that was edible. The waitress Tina was very nice and attentive  though. We paid for our food and ended up buying dinner somewhere else. I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Visiting old part of vegas during their Motor Bike Fest was a bad idea lol...Jammed packed line up past the door, Tony Roma's was the food place to be! located across from the Golden Nugget.
The service was an overall 2/5, there was mass confusion at first as we had three different servers coming to us.

Sampler platter 3.5/5
Potato skins with bacon, cheddar was delightful.  The wings were nice and spicy!!! and their mozarella sticks were pretty yum.

Prime Rib: $8.95 special 3/5 which included baked potatos and veggies.  Presentation was there, however not the best prepared...

overall this place was grungy, and quite noisy. Though this place wont break your wallet in terms of price, but you;ll have to sacrifice the service and quality.  HOWEVER this place was packed...."}
{"text":"I was charged twice $19.99 for two lobster and steak meals and an additional $19.99 for an extra lobster tail. I was charged wrong and nobody fixed it...I'm on my way out of town. Never again Tony total of $60 ...price should have been $35.... I was ripped off. It hurt me...its on my mind."}
{"text":"Well they blew it. 

Updating to one star.  Why? Simple. Some representative of Tony Roma's goes on all these low reviews with the same lame apology and offer of a chance to address it if you write this email address. So I thought, great! Well after sending a detailed email and providing my contact information as I was asked to do, I have heard nothing and it's been about 60 days or more. 

Definitely never returning to any location and if you were contacted on Yelp, I recommend not wasting your time. 

Feel free to read my original review for information about the horrid service & meal itself."}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas for my Dad's wedding, we choose to eat at Tony Romas for the rehearsal dinner. Good choice, I loved the baby back  ribs, the variety of sauces, I really liked the seasoned french fries and there homemade coleslaw . The waitstaff was outstanding, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Only eat ribs here. Anything else you will be very disappointed. The only good point is...its cheap."}
{"text":"This one is located inside the Fremont Hotel/Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. This place is always packed on the weekends expect to wait at least a min of 40 mins service is ok note the steak and lobster special is served at 9pm so if you come before that you won't be able to order it. If you're in the Downtown LV area this is one of the better places to eat other than the buffets or hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"Service is extremely poor, after ordering;trying to get someone's attention was an impossible task.

Food was 2.5 stars, better off paying a little more and going to Hugo's at the 4 Queens.

Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm not sure anybody has ever gone to a place advertising a $11.99 steak and lobster meal and expected all that much... and if you have, you should probably just do a bit of quick math to realize what's going on here: this means they acquired said steak and lobster for about $6 (since after all, they have to make a profit here, right?)... stay with me now... for simplicity's sake, let's just say they cost the same to the restaurant... now we're at $3 for the steak and $3 for the lobster. 

Now let me ask you a question: when have you ever been to a store and been all that excited if you saw a big cut of steak for $3? Or a lobster? If you're like me, the first thing that runs through your mind is: \"How sickly did this cow/crustacean have to be for them to offer to sell it to me at this price??\" Now, either Tony secured some awesome deal in the beef/seafood futures market ten years ago so as to lock in a below market price to be able to offer such a great deal... or it's just not great quality stuff. Unfortunately, I think it's the latter. 

This all being said - as the 3 star rating suggests, this place is A-OK as long as you're not expecting the Palms. Keep it on the radar for some late night eats in downtown LV."}
{"text":"B - List. Decent food. Friendly service. Awesome red wine. This place says comfortable. More: Meat is their specialty. The fish and pasta is hit and miss. If you want great salmon by-pass Tony's for Chianti's up the street. The pasta is marginally acceptable and average. FYI: I have noticed that when they get extremely busy (ie. the parking lot is full) the quality of food served is reduced."}
{"text":"We have never been to Tony Rome's. We thought that it would be good.  the place was packed. Boy was I wrong! One of the worst places I have ever eaten at. 2 meals had to be sent back. The Salmon was not cooked and mushy in the middle. Horrible service. Not a good dinning experience save your money and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Came in with a hungry party of 18 and left with an angry and even hungrier party of 18.

We were seated quick cause it wasn't busy but we waited like 45 mins for only two appetizers then waited another hour for nothing! The waiters never cared to take away our dishes, refill our waters, or even apologize for the wait and let us know our food would be a little while longer. Instead of waiting longer because it was already 930pm we left and went to in n out for my uncle's birthday dinner."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I went specifically for the $12 steak and lobster. We learned too late that even that wasn't worth the price. And our waiter was horribly inattentive. I mean, I understand you serve drunk people all day and that is probably grating, but this is the job you chose, so do it with some courtesy or don't do it at all.

The one positive thing I will say is I had a BLAST at the bar waiting for our table. The staff there was friendly and entertaining and drinks were cheap and generously poured."}
{"text":"I have sent numerous emails with no response... Apparently corporate doesn't care as well."}
{"text":"The $11.99 steak and lobster is so good!! The steak was so tender and the lobster tail was decent sized! 

If you can, sit in Ann's section! She's awesome! In such a high-volume, low-price atmosphere you would expect a gruff wait staff. Ann was funny, nice and personable! Exceptional service! 

The steak and lobster deal is from 9-11pm so getting in can be hard but we were a party of 2 and were sat in 15 minutes! If you are on Fremont Street go here!

And ask for Ann she's a riot!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to celebrate our first meal husband and wife. So here is what happened. After waiting almost an hour we finally got seated. It was busy because they had the steak as lobster. Long story short. First plate : hair in the food second plate: missing lemon asked the waiter for lemon. He was cleaning the table next to us with gloves on and a rag. He never took his gloves off, he went to back and brought the lemons with the same gloves. Gross. We told the manager, food poisoning Is really real. The manager made us pay for our appies and said sorry. In theory the appies should be free as they made us wait an hour n every where else was close."}
{"text":"Not good ribs at all.  They are over cooked baked or boiled then grilled and slathered in sauce.  I was very disappointed in the quality.  If you are used to making your own ribs then Tony Roma's will be a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for the $11.99 steak and lobster tail special on Monday night. The special did not disappoint. We arrived promptly at 9pm. The offer is after 9pm and almost everyone at the restaurant during that time is there for the special. The service was very efficient and we were seated and served our late dinner within 5 minutes. We also ordered a side of fries which were crunch and delicious. The steak and lobster comes with a baked potato and some vegetables that probably came from a frozen mix: corn, green beans, carrots."}
{"text":"If you stay at the Hilton garden inn, you get a free appetizer with your room card. I ordered the onion loaf, which is essentially onion rings molded into a circular wall and  looks like a nest. Pretty neat concept, except I've had better deep fried onions.

Their medallion steak filets were really really great and perfectly cooked. It also came with a half rack of ribs, which were well cooked, but their original BBQ sauce was the worst I've had. I had to switch out for the honey BBQ sauce instead.

Overall, it was a great meal, but you can also find good steaks elsewhere with better ribs. Also, the only other people there were old people."}
{"text":"SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL

Before we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.

We were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!

We had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.

Bread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.

I don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)

A good server can really set the tone for the evening. George's contagious smile kept us smiling all night too."}
{"text":"I have been to several different Tony Romas restaurants and I will say that this was the worst one I have been too. The menus were beat up , the decor was old and tired, the service was very slow and the ribs were dry and over cooked.  fare warning to all."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. 

Our server Matt was awesome. Our food was delicious. Our group of 8 were promptly served our meals and our glasses never empty. 

I had the steak medallions & ribs and it was prepared perfectly but a tad heavy with the sauces."}
{"text":"Even at 11.99 for steak and lobster, it wasn't worth it. Surly waitress until she brought the bill and smiled for tip. Steak was overcooked and dry, I couldn't tell it was lobster for the taste but because it came on a shell. The people who ordered off the menu didn't seem to do much better."}
{"text":"I was at this Tony Romas on Nov 21, 2011 for there 12.99 Steak n lobster with family and three of us order the same special!! But i guess you get for what you pay!! My steak and  was so bad that it was full of fat hard to chew was so disappointed that even my sisters and my boyfriends was just as bad!! My sister mentioned to the server after he came to our table and asked us how everything was and as soon as my sister mentioned the steak was rubbery and he just ignored us and just walked away!! I will say that he also took a long time to bring us our check let alone never came back to collect the check after he dropped it off!!  I was so disappointed that I should have walked away without paying because no one seem to notice but of course I'm not a person to do that so I had to find someone to take my money so i went straight to there greeter!!   The one thing I will say is I did not leave a tip to our server!! This place already charged me enough for a rubbery full of fat no meat steak that the service did not deserve a tip!!! I will never come to any of the Tony Roma's since they are over priced anyways!!!   so don't waste your money on the Special!!!"}
{"text":"My family & I always make it a point to hit up all the great food deals in downtown Vegas. So of course Tony Roma's located inside the Fremont hotel & casino is always one of those spots! 
If you come during the hours of 4-6:30 you can get a generous portion of prime rib, baked potato & veggies for $8.99! The dinner special is even better in my opinion. Lobster tail, sirloin steak, baked potato & veggies for $11.99! The steak itself isn't the greatest quality but what do you expect for $12?! The lobster was amaaazing though - would definitely get the special just for the lobster alone :p 
Regular menu prices are decent. They have a large variety of salads and sandwiches too if you're opting for a lighter dinner/lunch. 
It's a loud place. Tons of drunk people and rowdy crowds often stumble through here - but it's Vegas! Lol if you want a nice ambiance and \"fine\" dining make your way to the gold nugget or an actual steakhouse!"}
{"text":"I love going to Tony Roma's, the staff are very friendly and are able to answer any questions you may have about the menu. I like how they have more then one sauce for the ribs. I personally like the smokey ridges I believe it is called. It is a prefect way to spent a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Received a free birthday coupon, they are cutting down.  It used to be \"one free entree\", now it was up to $15 (what can you get for that?)  Last time we were here in June, I fell over their sign and had to eat with my leg elevated and swollen.     I had ordered rib steak which  was $23 and came practically blue.   When it was served again, it looked totally different and over cooked.   However, it WAS rib steak.    We went back on 2/15 and were seated immediately.    The server \"hovered\"  I hate that!

I knew what I wanted to order, but it was annoying.     My husband wanted the short ribs because he likes it and it  is very soft.  $17 and NO SALAD or SOUP goes with it.

To me,  anything over $15 should come with that.   Their spareribs were over $21 and also do not come with soup or salad.     I make better spareribs as the one time I ordered it when it came for a 1/2 rack special it was overcooked and dry.

We went a few times last year and the 3 filet medallions were good at $19, but after going to Roy Yamaguchis and having a filet, this doesn't even compare!    Roy;s was GREAT.   Of course we didn't pay for it, we went to a \"finance seminar\".

To get back to Tony Roma's this time, I ordered the rib steak, now $25.   Seriously, I took one look at it and it did not LOOK at all like a rib Isteak, even one without a bone. I asked the server to call over the manager, and she looked at the steak which I had only cut into one slice and said \"That is a rib steak\"    Well, it didn't taste or look like a rib steak.  At least not one cut from the center of a prime rib.   It tasted more like  a strip steak or  sirloin and was extremely firm.     The prime rib at the Suncoast buffet was ten times better and they cut it to order.   We pay $9.99 there.

Well, I ate the steak and gave half to my husband, but wrote to Tony Roma's corporate office.       I am waiting for a reply from their Operations Manager.
I am not sure if I will return there for steak anyway.    Maybe the filets.   

 We went to Outback and a few weeks ago had the exact same experience with the rib steak.   It was definitely NOT a rib steak.  The manager came over, apologized and picked out one personally and when I ate it , it was definitely  RIB steak.     Next time I am going to Austin's at the Texas Station.  For $5 more I can get a great steak and it comes with soup or salad and a vegetable."}
{"text":"worst restaurant ever!! the waitress had the nerve to come and tell me that my 2.5 yrs daughter is crying and the other client seems to be bothered by that and simply we have to leave!!!! not mentioning that we had to wait 35 min for our order to come !!!
First time at Tony Roma's and for Sure the Last time ."}
{"text":"I've had many experiences with this place.  It's currently on the downturn.  Mash potatos weren't fully mashed and came out cold.  Shrimp over cooked.  Beef ribs were luke warm and now cost over $30...I'm worried this place will soon close if something doesn't change again."}
{"text":"6 of us went there after the infocomm show we ordered straight from menu after a long wait to be approached by a waiter just rib combo meals nothing to taxing well our drinks never came even after asking several times then when our meal finally arrived we never got our sides as ordered . Adding that the half rack of ribs that was half the meal were 4 individual end cutoffs of the last little burnt rib tips  then after the meal came we finally got a bus boy to bring water.
We called the manager over and her response was there was nothing she could do . And demanded we pay the 175.00 check because she was to busy to deal with this . I cant believe that they treat customers like this after such a bad experience.We did not get what we ordered and they could care less.I was appalled by the total lack of customer service by this restaurant I assure you this is the last time I will ever spend a dime at this chain ..."}
{"text":"Where should I start... First, they took forever to bring us our food. Second, my medium cooked Roma hamburger came out well done and taste like charcoal. My friend ordered the St. Louis Ribs and they brought him the Baby back ribs. My friend's wife ordered a New York steak cooked medium and it came out as tough as dried leather. I would not recommend this place. Service was terrible and the food was worst!"}
{"text":"To make this short and sweet, we walked out before we got seated. Up entering, the hostess was having trouble finding a receipt for a customer, then as we were registering, another customer stated they were there first , to which the hostess said she had forgotten about them. We were then told it would be about a 40 minute wait while the arranged a table for us. Then another customer complaining that they were overcharged. Then looking throughout the place we noticed few customer and lots of tables with dirty dishes, so at this point we decided to leave and go to the tony Roma s on the ne side of Calgary where we had a great dining experience"}
{"text":"There were 6 of us in our party and we were promptly seated. Our server was very friendly and efficient. We each ordered different meals and I have to say that everyone enjoyed their meal. I had a medium rare Prime rib, my wife had fish and chips, and the others had ribs. Recommend prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"One of the worst places I have eaten at. The potato wasn't cooked/was very hard. The hamburger meat looked like was 2 weeks old. The baby back ribs came in two pieces. One of them was good/bbq, the other one i guess used a different sauce- it sucked and the meat was hard!

If you want to enjoy american food, go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Ate here 12/22 with my Dad.  Asked waiter to split the check 50/50. We each signed receipts for $23.25 each.  When I got home, I saw the $23.25 charge from my bank, but also the entire bill of $46.50.  I emailed Tony Roma's using the address on their website.  Twice.  never got a reply.  Went to my bank to dispute the charge.  The bank will refund me, but what crappy customer service.  Never got any response from this restaurant chain.  Will never eat at one of these again.  Ever."}
{"text":"The steak and lobster for $12 was great because of the price. The food here is priced affordable, and the quality is alright, but where else are you going to get steak and lobster for less than $15???
Pretty darn good deal! 

The service is okay. They did their jobs but took a while to refill our glasses. I won't put too much blame on them though, as it seems that I dined during prime time. It was really busy when I went!"}
{"text":"The food, service and prices were fine but there's just nothing really special about this place. It's just a typical chain with decent food."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a Steak and Lobster special for $11.99 that starts at 9 pm so when we got there at 8:40 on a Sunday, there was a pretty good line but it went very fast and we were seated in less than half hour. At the time we were there, most of the customer around me were eating the same thing but they crank out the volume pretty well. 

The staff is very friendly and they were on top of our drinks making sure the ice tea's, coffees and waters were all filled. They brought out a big basket of rolls and there is plenty of butter on the table. 

We got our plates fairly quickly. I will say that I have seen some pictures of steaks on this Yelp post but my steak could fit in the shadow of those steaks. I will post a picture and you be the judge. Actually worst than the size was the fact that my was pretty dry; however, when I looked at my Father-in-laws steak it was perfectly pink in the middle.and he had asked for his well done. I think they switched our plates. Too bad I ate my steak first then went after the lobster while he did the opposite. By the time he saw the inside of his steak, my was in my belly. Damn it.

Even with our little snafu, this is still a great deal and we all left very happy. There are much better steak and lobster plates in Las Vegas  but I appreciate not spending $100 on a plate. For a good deal, you cant go wrong with this special.

Its so nice having so many offerings in 200 yards or less. These are not the fancy upscale restaurants on the strip, these are the common  guy/gals place. It allows you to have a nice meal, see some great entertainment and still go play a little."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised that the food was decent.  As you walk along Fremont, you notice the signs that look a little dated advertising the food for reasonable prices .  It's located in the back of the casino and it's pretty cramped seating with average to sub average service. 

I ordered the ribs and 1/4 BBQ chicken combo, cole slaw and wild rice.  This was actually pretty good.  I've had better find and chicken, but it hit the spot. The meat had a nice char and flavor to it and the Cole slaw want too \"heavy\".  Rice, was meh... uncle ben's tastes the same, maybe better.   My friends meals looked and tasted good too from what they said."}
{"text":"We were on Fremont st and saw steak and lobster $11.99 at Tony Roma's from 9p-11p we had to wait like 30 mins but service was great food was delicious will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Mom wanted to eat here for her 80th birthday. Group of 8, so we're told automatic 18% gratuity. Expect great service. They don't take reservations, so came early to get a table. We are using the Aloha coupons for our meals, which on Thursday nights is just for the prime rib ( you can order something else and pay the difference ). Waitress didn't seem to happy when we advised we'll be using the coupons. They brought out rolls to begin with - which are a bit hard and mmhh. When the dinner came out, meats were cooked to order, but dry -   Only saw our waitress once since being served and again just for the bill. Overall, nah. Pass this one up."}
{"text":"Its been about 5 years since my last Tony Romas encounter. My last visit to an Edmonton store was not good, though they gave me a gift card to rectify things which could only be used at that Edmonton restaurant. I haven't been back to Edmonton since either.

I was craving ribs so this seemed like the easiest place to go to satisfy my stomach. I went with the standard back ribs and a caesar to drink. The caesar was fine, nothing to write home about. I didn't want a carb-y side so I went with a double portion of seasonal vegetables. When my plate arrived I had a rack of ribs and a pile of broccoli. 

My girlfriend commented that their \"seasonal vegetables\" was always broccoli. Comparing my double portion of broccoli to her single portion of broccoli I wonder which school the line cook went to to learn what \"double\" means. My portion certainly was not twice the amount of the single portion.

Oh yeah, the ribs. They were ribs. I guess its pretty telling how they were when I spend more time in my review on the sides than the star of the meal.

Service was rough around the edges. Our server wasn't bad, but just the type of service I would expect from a late night diner, not a restaurant on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I'm stumped by the negative reviews. 

Each and every time we've gone to TR, my wife, 2 daughters and I enjoy the food and love the servers.

We also appreciate the friendliness of the owner who comes out to greet us (I suppose that's because we've been customers for over 10 years)...

We always order the onion loaf (which we've never found to be greasy) and I always order the full rack of back ribs with the \"red hot\" sauce (which I've never found to be fatty).

We always seem to order the same thing and we've always been very satisfied.  Actually, I'm in the mood for TR ribs right now..."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:45 for a late lunch. It was posted outside that the lunch special is until 4 pm. We were standing for 5 mins before the waitress paid attention to us, the place was not even busy but she made us wait for another 3 mins as she will clean up a table. Gave us menus and forgot about us we had to flag another server. And our orders? Took 45 mins to come out. Will never come back. Went to Earl's instead, we were seated within 2 minutes by very friendly servers, had a menu in hand in the next 3 minutes, got our orders in the next 8."}
{"text":"Honestly don't even deserve a star. Sat down and got our waters. Waiter came to take our drink orders and then said, \"Oh wait, they were here first!\" and moved to next table. We requested another waiter and they moved us. We proceeded to move and wait for another waiter. Fifteen minutes later we left. Ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin...

But maybe this is the standard for old downtown vegas...

Our server was older and so so so rude. I get that youre in your 60's and still serving tables but for christ sake, be nice to your customers!! You had a group of 7, and we were mellow and low key. Instead you treated us like we were a nusience to you when all we came in for was to eat...
 
 The food was ok... Not bad, but not great either. My pulled pork sandwich was soooo dry. Didnt even eat half of it.

 Its very very loud and tight seating too...

I had hoped for more.

{"text":"Where's the beef?

We were attracted by the $11.99 steak and lobster offer so we walked in. Offer was only served for two hours between hours of 9:00p to 11:00p. This location was inside the Fremont Hotel in Fremont Street Experience so the restaurant was always crowded. We had a 20-min wait. Restaurant is not open in the mornings or lunch. They are open daily and begin serving at 4:30p.

Well, what did you expect for $11.99 right... small portions of everything. 8-oz steak was small and rubbery but the 5-oz lobster tail was delicious with lots of butter. Two bites for me. I didn't eat the house veggies as it didn't look fresh and appealing. The meal also came with baked or mashed potatoes. I think bread was served also before the meal, I can't remember. The service was slow but it wasn't our server's fault, the restaurant was just too packed, but she was nice and friendly.

Review #0152"}
{"text":"Great steak and lobster dinner for $11.99 after 9PM. Restaurant was crowded, had to wait a while to be seated. Also had to wait a while for our food to be served, however, you can't beat the price. Food was very good and the waitresses were trying to be attentive. Highly recommend this place for a late night dinner."}
{"text":"It was pretty good and my girl and I used a coupon ;] i got 3 medallions"}
{"text":"The server Jordan was very pleasant and i recommend asking to be seated in her section. The food on the other hand was nothing extraordinary in my opinion. Although there was nothing wrong with the food it just did not stand out in any special way. Overall great service, food was brought quickly and served hot. Just lacking it's own unique flavour."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!  I lost a whole day in Vegas puking with fever in my room!  I don't drink but maybe 2 drinks a day so I am NOT hung over!  Clearly food poisoning.  We had the spinach and artichoke dip - tasted like it was from a frozen box.  The fried onion - doesn't hold a candle to Outback - bland!  Firecracker Shrimp - AWFUL - got sick from either the lettuce or the shrimp.  Ribs - REALLY?  You call those good ribs!  They seriously need to reorganize this whole restaurant.  I will NEVER go back!  If only there was a zero star rating!!!"}
{"text":"We go there every couple of weeks on Mondays for the all you can eat ribs.  The Tony Romas in Cleveland used to be awful.  This one put our faith back in the franchise.  While they are not the greatest ribs in the world, they are much better than average and good enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"We were seated within 10 minutes, but that's the only good part. It took our server 20 minutes to get to our table to take our order.  During this time, 2 tables near us left because they got tired of waiting for service. The food came out fairly quickly. It was horrible. Server forgot one of my sides. 5 minutes later it came out, but she just dropped it off and ran.  Didn't ask how our food was so she couldn't see that the medium rare steak I ordered was well done instead. The meat had to be from the oldest cow in the country. It was so tough that it was hard to eat. We just wanted to get out of there, but again, our server was nowhere to be found. We had to ask 2 people to send our server over. I will say this was a Saturday night and it was busy, but we didn't see the server anywhere in the restaurant.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen!!!
When I was young, I remember coming to Florida to visit my father... I would look forward to a few things. My summer friends, Disney and Tony Roma's \"a place for ribs\".
We would always get ribs, some great appetizers and the onion loaf... a couple of years ago, I was in Orlando and on International drive I ate at a Tony Roma's, fantastic! 
Well, this visit to Tony Roma's in the strip was anything but... When I saw the sign, immediately I said, Tony Roma's \"a place for ribs\", I LOVE THAT PKACE!!! Man what a disappointment! 
When we arrived, there were cheap dollar store wicker baskets in the table with little individual promise margarines. YUK! Not to mention, no bread was even brought to the table, so what was the promise even for? We were starving, so we ordered apps and the onion loaf. GROSS! The apps were cold, lifeless and clearly crappy frozen product that I could have e gotten in Publix. The onion loaf, crispy outside but a mushy and pasty inside... dinner, good ribs, but the sides, cold and terrible! Garlic mashed potatoes had no taste! The consistency was terrible... well, I know one thing. Next time I'm in Vegas. No Tony Roma's for me! 
I'm in the industry, I know that Tony Roma's is undergoing some change with the new TR Grill. Unfortunately, that change never made it out to Vegas. They're still stuck in 1978!!!"}
{"text":"I order the baby back ribs with side of potato and the food was pretty good. The wait was fast, and the service was good. No issues! I would come back again."}
{"text":"We received a coupon for a free entree with the purchase of another entree, so we decided to have dinner at Tony Roma's on a recent Friday evening. It was pretty early when we arrived so there was no wait. 

Our server was quick to take our drink orders... However he never brought out any bread, which was the only real disappointment of the evening. At first I thought that perhaps Tony Roma's stopped serving complimentary bread, but then noticed another waitress bringing some out for a nearby table. 

We decided to split the spinach and artichoke dip as a starter. My husband went with the mojo chicken which came with rice and broccoli. I had the filet medallions with a half rack of baby back ribs, which came with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. 

I should have gone with a full rack of ribs. After all it IS what they are famous for. The filet was fine.  I requested it be cooked medium, which is was, and it was very tender. The ribs were amazing though. Falling off the bone with just enough sauce. I don't know why I even bother with menus when it comes to Tony Roma's. Next time, I won't! 

Total damage was $60, including tip, after the coupon. I have had better service at Tony Roma's in the past but I won't let one mistake keep me away, especially if they keep sending me great coupons!"}
{"text":"So apparently their customer service online is worse than in the restaurant!!!! 

I emailed the very polite and concerned sounding PR team 3 MONTHS AGO!! And haven't received any response whatsoever! 

Tony Roma's... You are a complete joke."}
{"text":"I see a lot of pissing and moaning about this place like people are expecting a 5 star eating experience. You get what you pay for. If you're going for the $12 Steak/Lobster, don't go expecting a fancy huge steak and a huge lobster tail. Also don't expect that you're going to be the only person with an inside desire for this. Hello, this is Vegas!

Regardless of if you're here for the special or the regular menu, you're given a paper number. For those complaining about such, remember that this is Vegas. Lots of drunk people, young 21s etc who've probably walked off with the digital pagers etc. thinking it'd make a great souvenir.

It was about a 20 minute wait time for the regular crowd. Dunno about the special crowd for the steak/lobster, as we came about an hour before they did. And they don't give out numbers for that special until around 15-20 minutes before they open for such.

The wait wasn't too bad but as others have said, it gets so busy in this place that wait time on food and/or drinks can be horrendous at times.

Not the worst experience but definitely not great either."}
{"text":"Amazing food and some of the best service we have had anywhere. Thank you Kelsi for being an AMAZING server. Refilled our drinks before we had to ask, checked on us often and brought a take home box before I had to ask and always with a smile and fantastic attitude. We will be back to sit on the bar side in hopes of having her serve us again!!!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this Tony Roma's in particular because while I used to be a regular, I quit eating here about a year ago because every single time I hated my meal. Like 4 times out of the last 5. I have a firm \"three strikes you're out\" rule when it comes to restaurants and this location let me down so many times that I just quit going. The parking lot here is always empty so that should alert everyone to the fact that I'm not the only person who has abandoned Tony Roma's! 

Fast forward to a year later. My husband gets his \"free birthday entree\" e-mail and begs me to go for all you can eat ribs night. I don't eat ribs, but he says Tony's has some of the best. Begrudgingly, I agreed to go with him. He ordered the ribs and I opted for the chicken spinach stack. In the past, this spinach stack has been abysmal. Tonight it was pretty good! The chicken breasts were juicy and well seasoned and the spinach stuffing on top was good. It tasted like a frozen and microwaved spinach dip but whatever, this is a chain restaurant and for chain food, it was okay. 

Hubby said the ribs were really tasty and they were all you can eat. Our waiter encouraged him to eat more, not like some places where they try to shame you into stopping your reorders before you are full; though the kitchen DID pull the \"let's-take-a-super-long-time-to-bring-out-his-reorders-so-he-will-give-up\" but the joke was on them, we had all night to sit and wait!

One major disappointment is that they've taken away their Coke Zero. BOO! 

The service was great too. So great that we asked to speak to the manager. This location is really cleaning up their act. I'll be sure to go back in a few weeks to give it another try. Here's hoping this visit wasn't just a fluke and Tony Roma's is turning itself around!"}
{"text":"Spinach / artichoke dip was a good starter. New york strip was good, ribs were good, though the extra sauce on the table was unexceptional. Lobster tails were strong and overcooked, in spite of having to wait for them \"they weren't ready\", I suspect the waitress just forgot. We ordered mahi mahi and got chicken, when the replacement fish finally arrived it was watery and not real warm. We received dinner rolls when we were almost finished eating, they were warm but nothing to write home about. Baked potato and baked beans were good, fries were standard. Coleslaw was good.

       Ambiance was no big shakes, all in all about the class of Applebees but more expensive, if not for winning some money at the 4 Queens down the street we may have been more upset, fortunately we didn't wait in line like many people had to.

          Staff were just short of rude. Another table found a foreign object in there food. The mahi mahi, lobster tails and coffee were not on the bill, so that was refreshing 
(we didn't ask to have them removed) if we would have had to pay for those items I would have taken off another star. If you're looking for a special place to dine this ain't it, if you're looking for an overpriced, moderate-quality meal stop by Tony Romas."}
{"text":"Not as bad as what others said about this place. The service was slow but she was very nice. Food was not bad but not great"}
{"text":"I went for a second ~$15 discounted birthday meal in the late afternoon today. Now I'm bumping up my rating due to a marked improvement in service.

Unlike last time, there was somebody immediately posted at the front who greeted me. Also unlike last time, I was helped with my order after maybe just 2-3 minutes. It was actually the employee at the bar instead of my designated server who took my order, but I appreciated that she stepped in when I clearly hadn't been helped. She also suggested the complimentary bread, which I don't recall from my previous visit. And after she brought out the bread, she offered to switch the nearest TV (at the corner of the bar) to a football game.

Also of note: my server checked on me multiple times throughout the night and was even so kind as to bring me a mint and a warm wetnap at the end of my meal. I will say that it seemed notably less busy than my previous visit, but the service was more than proportionally better today. As for the food, the bread with butter was decent and rustic Italian sausage pasta was pretty good, although I did add a little salt.

After I got my pleasantly zero-y receipt, the manager introduced himself and asked if I was Chris. I responded affirmatively, and he mentioned that he recognized me because he had just sent me a message on Yelp today. Actually, I had read the message and was hesitant to respond to his request for a phone conversation, lest he make some sort of free meal offer. I do feel comfortable with taking the free meal semi-anonymously and of my own accord though, since there isn't any fine print restricting the birthday offer from being used more than once.

Give these guys a shot if you're in the area and want a casual restaurant for ribs or Italian, or even a nice happy hour. I'd feel comfortable with coming back."}
{"text":"Don't do it ! Don't do it! Don't do it ! Don't be fooled by the \"special\"... the only thing special about that steak was its ability to break my jaw. They sell it cheap because it's the worst cut of meat they can find. Even cooked medium rare it's like chewing bad beef jerky. I expected more from a Tony Roma's. Thanks for ruining our meal. The service was horrible too! Once we finally got our terrible meal we never saw the waiter again until it was time for the check. Just stay away from this place !"}
{"text":"Typically you run specials so people can come to your establishment and see what they are missing while you showcase your food and service. Tony Roma's doesn't get it! We went there after seeing their $12.99 Prime Rib special, mistake!!!! An hour wait for a piece of meat sliced so thin you could almost see through it, with no flavor, served by an overworked, inadequate, pissy waitress, if that's what you like then this is the place for you! The onion loaf was the only good part of the meal."}
{"text":"40 min wait to get in, another 35 or so minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us and another 20 for our appetizers to be brought. So according to their keep your dining experience to 90 minutes sign we should have probably been given our good in to go containers. The appetizers looked like they had been under a heat lamp or microwaved several times. The steak was bland and cold. The only bright spot were the ribs which had good flavor and were actually hot"}
{"text":"came here for their lobster and steak deal on a tuesday night at 9pm to 11pm. the wait was about 20 mins since it we got there at 830 isn. and it doesn't start tip 9pm. 

the waiting time for the food was about 15 mins i went to the casino and purchase some more beers and walked in with it and they don't mind since it was a better deal than what they were offering inside the restaurant. 

the steak was not rubber which was surprising for only 11.99. it wasn't the best but its edible and easy to chew on. the lobster tail was absolutely good and tender with the melted butter  and the wedge lemon drizzled on top. also came with a baked potato and corn as veggies. i was very satisfied with the meal with no complaints. i will be back when i come visit here. 

the service was so so, since they were al packed."}
{"text":"They told us this is the texture you get when you order a sirloin cooked medium well it will be dry. There are 6 other complaints at this same but this manager says this is basically our fault for ordering it. BULLSHIT"}
{"text":"In case anyone was wondering what the $11.99 steak and lobster special looks like, I posted a picture of it

Nothing wrong with it, portions are on the smaller size, but that's to be expected.  The veggies are a but of a joke - straight from the freezer aisle. 

Anyways, I'd still say worth :) 

4* for value.  To all the 1* reviews - Don't expect someone to wait your table like a five diamond restaurant and don't expect Michelin starred steak for $11.99."}
{"text":"So I have never been to a Tony Roma's before, I thought they were a decent chain steakhouse.  Boy was I wrong.

I was with my wife on Valentines day and went towards the end of the night.  The wait was reasonable given the day. We were sat in the back by the host who sat 2 tables at a time, efficient, I liked that.

So our server (Mariella) took a bit to come over and when she did she was very short, not friendly, and just wanted to get our drink order.  We were trying to ask her simple questions about the special, which she didn't seem to happy to be answering (I suppose she assumed we were cheap, which is fair, but not true by any means).  You could tell she was in a hurry and wanted to get this over with.  We ordered drinks, but if she would have given us 30 seconds we could have ordered our whole meal, saving her another 5 minutes.

She brings the drinks (wine) and takes the order, 2 regular priced steaks ordered medium rare. Well this was about the last time we saw our server.  The steaks came out in a reasonable amount of time, but were over cooked.  All the sides were cold.  We weren't going to have them recooked (as I normally would an over cooked steak) but the side could have been addressed.  Well she never came back.  I had to stop a male server to ask for the sauce that was on the menu which she did drop off, but did so in a sprint and did not ask us anything about our food or if we wanted more drinks (which we did). So we choked down 2 horrible steaks.  

The whole time I could see my server doing side work 4 tables away.  This is unprofessional in several ways, reflects poorly on the server but also that the company is having them do so much side work rather than have other hour employees roll silverware.   I heard her trying to give away tables because she was trying to get out of there, which sucks that she would give such bad service then dump them on another employee to take sales and tip outs on horrible service.  Mean while, we were pretty much done at this point and had already had our card on the table for 10 minutes, which she would have known, if she EVER stopped by.  

When she was finally done rolling her silverware she came by and asked if we wanted more wine (we did 20+ minutes ago) and still didn't notice a credit card at the edge of the table.  I had to hand it to her and tell her to close us out.  We almost just left without paying seeing as no one knew that we were there.  

Needless to say, this is the only time I have never tipped, even bad service and rude people still get 5-10% out of me seeing as I worked in the industry for 15 years.  I will make sure all my friends and family that visit me never go to this restaurant when they are in town.

Do not go to this restaurant, keep walking down the street, there are plenty of good restaurants a block down."}
{"text":"Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy, crowded, disorganized, and there are not enough waiters. In our case we got out appetizer and our entree with about a 2-3 minute seperation. They had not even cooled enough to eat them before we got the entree. We were not the only one either, the people next to us had the same thing happen with an even shorter delay. So lets move onto the entree... Two steaks both looked good on the outside. One ordered medium the other medium rare... Both are RARE beyond rare. Giant red center all the way to the edge. This place is to expensive for the level of service that they provide.

So after this bad experience why did I give a two star review instead of a one.... Because the potato skins were delicious"}
{"text":"We walked in to an almost empty restaurant at 7.30 pm on a Sunday evening. We got greeted, sat and attended to promptly by the same person...

We placed our order - Half order onion loaf as an appetizer to share, two Tony Roma size racks of ribs with different sides for the main course.

We also received a bread basket with nice warm bread... until we realized that the bread was completely stale.

About twenty minutes later the ribs arrived with the sides, both racks were delicious and piping hot... no sign of our appetizer, as the server placed the ribs I said \"you should probably just cancel the onion loaf\", \"Oh, did no one bring that out...?\" we were asked...

The sides were average, watery coleslaw for us both and two premium sides. Mac & cheese... tasted just like Kraft dinner and sweet potato fries served with Maple butter(?) this tasted like straight honey, not something we would ever think of pairing with sweet potato fries.

Thank fully the ribs were good otherwise the evening would have been a complete disappointment.

We wont be going back in a hurry."}

{"text":"I am not a fan! I was here 2 weeks ago while visiting Vegas. This restaurant is located inside the rear of a hotel on the popular Fremont Street Experience. 
The wait here was 35 minutes long. We had to take a number and wait for our name and number to be called. 
We sat around the casino floor area waiting to be seated. 
We had one server for drinks and table necessities and one server for food. The drink server kept my glass filled and my napkins fresh. He moved fast, but was kind and courteous. My food server was clearly over worked. He had so many tables he barely had time to allow me to finish my order. I had a lackluster burger with limp fries. My companion had a burger slightly undercooked. When we mentioned this to the food server he didn't blink nor bat an eye. 
We are less than 1/4 of what was presented on the plates. This was a valuable lesson for me, my instinct said no after hearing the wait time, I should have followed that.
The service was ok, not great but ok. The food was just not tasty, aesthetically unappealing and mediocre. 
I won't return. I can find better ways to lose $10. 
I wish Yelp offered half point ratings. 1.5 based on our drink server."}

Their business page on yelp said they close at 11 pm. We walk in at 10:30 pm and the host asks how many people re in our party. We say 5 and his response was \"if nothing opens up in 30 minutes we can't serve you.\" Umm wtf kind of crap is that? So many things wrong with that answer.

1. You close at 11, not 1030!!!
2. Why even ask how many people if you're not even going to serve us?
3. We saw about 4 open tables. Why not sit us there?
4. Way to be accommodating to paying customers. I'm sure it's awesome for business.

Unfortunately, we were seated. Our server was pleasant enough. I didn't eat anything since I had eaten earlier, but my friends said the food tasted old. I know for sure we won't be back.

Go somewhere else for better service and food!"}

We came in here looking for a steak and hungry.  We sat down and had waters immediately, and it seemed like we had a personal water cooler at the table because the glasses were never empty.

We ordered the beef ribs and 2 prime rib specials.  Prime rib, baked potato & mixed veggies for $8.95!  Wow! What a bargain, and plenty of food.

The meals came out within 10 minutes.  We ate and paid the bill and were in and out of this place within 1/2 hour.  Amazing service and satisfying and delicious meal, that was VERY affordable for Vegas!

I will never come back here and I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here. I asked for medium well and but it came back dry to where I couldn't even swallow it. I only ate the lobster and even that was a lil dry luckily I had butter on the side but it wasn't hot."}

After we were seated, the experience changed for the better. Our server was prompt, attentive to detail, and light hearted even though it was obvious he was overworked.

Steak came out wrong, no big deal...they were HAPPY to take it back and make it right. They even let my girlfriend eat the lobster tail on her first plate and they brought out a whole new plate with her new steak which was perfect. 

Great job staff! Keep up the good work! Excellent value! Large portion!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back in a few years, and once again, they have a new menu.

This time we (my wife and I) just stuck to the basics......Chicken Tenders w/ fries and I had the Chicken Sandwich w/ Cheese, Bacon and BBQ Sauce with fries.

The service was fast and friendly, and the food this time was outstanding.

I am not sure that I like the new menu and prices, but we will consider coming back in the future, for the chicken.

The restaurant is very clean and the decor is very casual......

{"text":"Ok. I really should have read the reviews first. But alas, we got the steak and lobster for 12 bucks. Mmm K. I can sum this up very very easily. \"Cruise Food\". This is what you'd get on a cruise buffet. But I'm not mad, after all it was only 12 dollars. But, do NOT get an alcohol drink here.  Blech. We never saw our waitress and had 3 different ones. Not to mention, no attention. Not just us, but everyone. 

I'd be uber surprised if this is what Tony Roma had in mind for his standards as part of his chains. I'd be curious to know what he thought if he came here and had to eat this. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I signed up for the E-club and they sent me a FREE Entree for my Birthday!! I love FREE Stuff! 

Last time I went here I tried the burgers-NOT real impressive, so this time I asked the waitress to suggest the best thing. RIBS!\"that's what she said\"

So I got the full rack of St Louis Style Ribs with sweet corn casserole & loaded baked potato.

The restaurant was fairly slow with 4-5 customers so the food came out fast and the service was adequate.

They have a large LCD Tv on the wall so I was able to enjoy the MNF game and the food was really good.

Not REAL bbq but the meat was tender, the sauces were all good. The baked potato was great & so was the casserole(just not enough of it).

Be sure to take advantage of this offer and CLICK on any Image!"}
{"text":"From 9:30 pm to 11pm, you can get lobster tail, steak and potato for only $10. Usualy about 15 minutes wait, but well worth it. Hamburger is another good choice. Value for the money!"}
{"text":"Please don't eat here!! From walking in was totally unorganized u have 2 go thru a crowd 2 grab a number. Then u wait people just standing all over not knowing whats going on then a woman shouts ur number out. We were seated waitress was very nice. But our food came omg was awful from our appetizers tasting like it was microwaved. Our main dishes came the st.louis ribs, it was so not full of flavor and the bbq sauce was like just throwing ketchup on it. The food was just not worth the money. We sat next to where they make the drinks in this room this woman next to us asked for bread and the waiter went in that room grabbed the bread out of a bag that was in a drawer and he put in a basket n wrapped it with a material napkin like it was freshly baked lol. Well Tony Romas this place is putting your name to shame."}
{"text":"Omg! So sketchy! We showed up at 845pm they have a steak and lobster special that starts at 9 for 11.99 this drunk zombie sat next to us an ordered it it showed up in like 30 SECONDS serious. That freaked me out that they are just holding all that food! Scared me really we left"}
{"text":"I loved Tony Roma's tonight and I admit to completely gorging on my \"all you can eat riblets\" at 20 dollars, this entitles you to all bottomless, coleslaw, riblets, coke or coffee.

Celebrated my birthday yet again with friends and I was really impressed with although the restaurant was full, we got seated and served right away.  In fact Alex served it up just right giving us the utmost in personal attention.

The one food item that enticed me the most was the onion loaf, this is a breaded onion ring loaf that is the size of a cake, and shaped like one.  This costs around 9 dollars and is huge, served with a nice tangy sauce, I loved this option.

The peeps had the 8oz Burger and Blue Cheese burger and my other friend had the traditional Tony Roma Ribs that they are so famous for.

This meal plus the service was both thoroughly enjoyed.  Our waitress is extremely honest as well, asking if we needed change when in fact it was her tip.

Nice location, convenient, clean, nice and spacious."}
{"text":"Great Service. Food was in need of help. Will try ribs next - However, somebody else will pick up the tab."}
{"text":"Glad I didn't pay for my meal here.

Ended up going to this Tony Roma's which is inside the Fremont Casino with a large group (my family primarily). As stated at the beginning of the review, glad I wasn't paying for my meal because it was not good.

I ordered the \"recommended\" Tony Roma's Steakhouse Burger and asked for it medium well. It came out medium for sure. Very pink in the middle, definitely not cooked enough to my liking. However, I was so hungry I did not bother to return it to the waitress. I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. She seriously was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I think she had too many tables.

My brother also had the Steakhouse burger. We both agreed it wasn't anything spectacular. It came with two big slices of bacon on it and it was a pretty good size. The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. It seemed like they'd been sitting around before being brought out. My aunt got the spinach dip appetizer. I had a taste, it tasted like spinach dip... and it too was lukewarm. My uncle got the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps looked decent sized, but the presentation was a little weird in my opinion. 

This place is seriously a tourist trap for sure. The dining room is also dark and off-putting. They have really, really cheap specials which i did not partake of, but I don't know, maybe they're worth it? 

Final decision: Tony Roma's will not be on my list of places I want to go eat."}
{"text":"Got the steak and ribs. Steak was ok, ribs were bad.  They were so fatty and overdone. Service wasn't the greatest. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went in for the $11.99 lobster and steak special! It was a great meal for the price! 4 stars instead of 5 because the service could've been better. Our server took about five minutes to even greet us. The busser took my ice tea to refill it and never brought it back lol either way the food is so cheap and was the perfect meal to enjoy on Fremont"}
{"text":"Steak & Lobster: What do you expect for $11.99?

On food alone, it would be a 2-star, \"Meh. I've experience better.\", but factor in the price and service and it really was A-OK (at least for us). Three of us went for the special, mom went for the ribs. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. Our tails, though small, were tasty. The steaks, well things break down here a bit. They were very thin, and a bit on the tough side, but not so bad that we did not finish them. Veggies were no big deal but the potato was OK. 

If I had more time, I probably would have come back to try the $8.99 prime rib.

One thing to note, when it says 9PM, it means 9PM. The computerized ordering system won't give you the special price until 9, and the hostess won't seat you until you are ready to order. Couple that with people are going to queue for the special(s), and you may want to get there a little early.

Bottom line: I'm glad we had this \"special\" experience. 

PS. If you are a bit early, you can order drinks and appetizers and then place your special entrees order after 9."}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf lobster/steak meal and it was okay.  It goes back to the whole... you get what you pay for.... and for this meal it hold's true.  I'd rather have a delicious hamburger instead.  But even still, it wasn't a bad meal if you need lobster on a budget, but don't expect 5 star taste.  The waiters were nice and the expierence was decent."}
{"text":"My friends and I were drunk...and loud....and obnoxious...and I gotta hand it to Vanessa and Allen for taking everything in stride and allowing us to be....us...LOL!  Thank you both for your kindness! 

We were walking down Fremont looking for more food!  LOL!  I suggested ribs..and in we went.  The wait wasn't long since it was 10:30...people were still coming in since they close at midnight.  Three of us got ribs, and one tried the steak and lobster special.  Steve-O asked for lobster in his mash taters and they obliged.  I got a side of bacon mac n cheese.  Everything came out in a timely manner...and granted, my buddies were still drinking, so we kept on being obnoxious.

Again, shoutouts to Vanessa and Allen...I seriously hope these are the names of the two servers that took care of us....they were both very kind!"}
{"text":"You absolutely can't beat a steak and lobster meal for $11.99.  This is available nightly from 9-11.   It's a very busy time, very loud, but you just can't beat that price! . We shared a very yummy dense strawberry cheesecake dessert."}
{"text":"Not sure with all the negative or bad review but this place must have improved cause when I came here for the $11.99 Steak & Lobster special between 9pm-11pm, I had a good experience. Came here on a Sunday night.  It will get crowded so try to arrive a little early cause they will not start seating the customer(s) until 9pm.  My friends and I got lucky cause we were like fourth in line and got seated right away. Even tho it was busy the services was great, friendly, and was attentive making sure our meal was okay. Even the manager walked around making sure everyone was enjoying their meals & asking how we are doing. Don't expect a big huge portion of steak & lobster but it was a good size. The steak was a little bigger then my palm of my hand and the lobster was a good size not to small or big. My friend order the steak medium & it was cook just right. He was able to enjoy his steak and lobster, not to chewy or hard just right.  The baked potato was a good portion and had all the toppings. I order the maui maui with mango sauce. The fish was not dry or over cooked it was perfect and the mango sauce was flavorful.  We didn't wait long either came out maybe about 10-15 mins after we place our orders. I gave it a three cause it's a typical Tony Roma's...would definitely come back for the steak & lobster special."}
{"text":"Went in for the $11.95 steak and lobster and it was really busy but it was good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night right after the super bowl. There was a 10 minute wait, and the wait ticket had my friends lucky number, so of course we had go play it. We came back a couple spins later and were immediately seated Our server was professional, pleasant and provided quick service. Our ribs and stakes were brought out after 10 minutes or so. My steak was a little over cooked, and didn't didn't have very much flavor, which isn't a big deal if you like A1 sauce. The chicken was dry. Their beans however are delicious and so are the french fries and potato skins! The 3 stars is for service! I regret to say the food was sub par, and not as enjoyable as I had hoped."}
{"text":"I am very biased when it comes to reviewing a Tony Roma's since I ran one in Canada. I could really understand now why this company is closing down restaurants left and right in United States. Tony Roma's has become another typical American chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesday, Applebee's, Chili's or TGI Friday's. There's nothing special about this restaurant. Of all the tables I witnessed, none of the patrons ordered ribs, everyone was ordering the steak and lobster special. It's sad when I see a very popular restaurant chain like Tony Roma's  succumb to bland food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Oh, Heaven's No.

Long lines, VERY subpar food, inattentive and overworked servers...

So why did I go here?

Like everyone else duped by Las Vegas advertising, the prices for their steak and ribs!

And to think I could've made some money on a slot machine than throw it away on glorified cafeteria food.

SMH

AVOID"}
{"text":"The waitstaff is nice, but definitely overworked. The service was slow even though there were 2 people working our table of 7. 

I ordered a 9oz. sirloin with lobster tail. If you order a steak you can get a lobster tail for $10. I estimate that the lobster tail had been sitting under a heat lamp for about 10 hours. It was shriveled to the size of a prawn and tasted like cardboard, no, um, rubber, um, not quite, well, let's just say it was awful and no amount of melted better could save it. 

The steak wasn't quite that bad, but it was bad. I ordered medium rare and it came out medium. It was tough and dry and yucky, yes, yucky. The baked potato was actually pretty good and I ate all of it.

I definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Showed up before 6:30 for the prime rib... We were told that they were out.  They don't care if you're here at 6:31.  No exemptions."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any of the steak options. their meat is always bevy juicy and tender. their potato soup is great"}
{"text":"This place has great food at an affordable price. The waitress was really friendly. I recommend if you are in the area. I will be returning again on my next trip."}
{"text":"1 Star, more like -3.... It's been a long time since I tried this place but since I just joined yelp I wanted to share my experience.  I took a date, who I'm now married to, here for dinner one night and the experience was horrible.  I've been a manager in food service for close to 14 years now and it was appalling how bad the service was.  We arrive about an hour and 15 or 20 minutes before closing time and though it took 20 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant before we could even place our order, drink order included, and both our steaks were burned and dry we were rushed to finish because they were getting ready to close... Mind you it took another 45 minutes to get our food which would explain why they were so extremely over cooked.  The steak was so dry that I was dipping it in ketchup which is pretty much the most offensive condiment you could put on a steak just to be able to chew it.  We didn't finish our meal and I refused to pay because of the horrible service for which the manager didn't even apologize or come out to ask what was wrong.  Since then I've gotten a number of coupons in the meal for things like buy one entrée get the second free and not even a free entrée is worth making me go back."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite spots for baby back ribs and I've never been disappointed. Great ribs and when combined with a loaded baked potato you have a winning combination.

This location (on Freemont Street) is a very busy one. You need to either be there early (like 5:00) or be willing to wait to be seated. It is a very popular location, especially now that it is the only Tony Roma's in Las Vegas. If you enjoy good ribs, the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Setting:  If you've been to a Tony Romas, the one in Sahara is all the same.  It has the normal restaurant look...nothing too special.

Food:  I haven't had a bad experience in a Tony Romas yet.  The ribs were their usual good self.  I suggest ordering ribs with original sauce, then ask for all the other sauces on the side...then dip and dip and dip.  Yum!

Service:  Our waiter was cool, talkative, was joking around a few times.  No complaints here.  They were all nice folks.  A couple of them came by to talk about the Superbowl.  :)"}
{"text":"I had not been in Tony Roma's for years, but at 11pm-ish at Freemont Street and hungry, this was our choice. Set inside Binions (I think) it was busy, but we played some slots while waiting. Surprisingly, we were able to hear our number over the casino noise. Anyhow, let's get to the important part. We both opted for the $11.99 steak and lobster, medium rare, which is the deal that brought us in the first place. Now I'm not going to try and convince you that it was the best steak and lobster we have ever had, (It wasn't) but it was pretty good and came with a giant potato and veggies and hit the spot for our particular needs at the time. Service was fine and it was clean enough. If you ever find yourself hungry downtown, check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed, unless you're expectations are to get a $100 experience for $11,99."}
{"text":"A friend and I were staying at the Fremont last week. Our goal was to live it up for a few days, you know, the usual Vegas routine, golf, drink, gamble, and eat well. It all went according to plan but for some reason we hadn't had a great meal in four days, instead nibbling on snack bars and such. Finally on our last night, we hit Tony Roma's. It was busy but our server did a great job. My buddy had the full rack of baby backs and I went with half rack with sirloin. Two words, absolute perfection! Roma's has never let me down, the best ribs in the country."}
{"text":"I was terribly disappointed.  I first ate at Tony Roma's in Florida 38 years ago.  Since then have eaten countless times at various locations in So Calif; and more recently in both Queens & Rockland County, NY and always enjoyed the meal.  We only moved to Vegas last month, and this was the first time we tried Tony Roma's in Vegas and never will again.  The hostess was sloppy, the busboy took my date's request for water and left the table without even acknowledging me.  The waitress was either very busy or lazy because AFTER she brought our salads, I HAD to request bread -- then on her next trip to the table, we repeated our request, and she finally brought it after our entrees.  The salad was very disappointing, and the ribs were worse.  Not only that but the hotel was doing some cleaning work (at 5pm) and it was a terribly long walk to the restrooms because the direct path was blocked off (the restaurant staff didn't think this was inconvenient for customers)."}
{"text":"The $11.99 steak and lobster was really good for the price. Much better than I expected. Everything was tasty, and decent sized portions.

The service was good. It was my wife's birthday, and they gave her a free ice cream with with a candle and sang Happy Birthday to her.

We had a good experience here. I would definitely go back for the steak and lobster!"}
{"text":"As fun and exciting as Freemont Street has to offered, my recommendation is to eat at the Strip as this appeared to be a one of the better choices on Freemont Street. The service is chaotic at best and the maître d' is Dr. Jekyll and \"Miss\" Hyde. She bumped her friends in from the long wait line. 

The food... Let's just say that Gordon Ramsey would have fired the chef. The steak was blended and they served frozen mixed vegetables with over cooked, frozen lobster tail. Thank god we didn't order any appetizers. I don't want to think what it'd taste like if they can mess up the daily specials."}
{"text":"Okay, if you are here to whine about the cheap food, than that's just dumb. My wife and I got the $8.99 prime rib. It was really, really delicious. It was juicy and filling and the cost was more than worth it. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm used to paying $40-$80 for a quality steak so I definitely wasn't expecting something so inexpensive and delicious. I'm happy we listened to the cabbie who suggested this place.

I definitely advise it if you want some quality food and want to save your dough for the tables."}
{"text":"This is not our usual Tony's but we were on this side of town so we tried it out. The food was good. We both had steak and they came out like we like them. My drink on the other hand was not great. The bartender left for the day & my waiter..who was very SLOW had to make it. Eghh. He was annoying the crap out of my hubby with his lack of concern for us. We never got the bill so we \"guessed\" what what owed and dropped cash down & left. Wont be coming back to this one again."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place this time but they were not doing a good job with anything that night. It was Halloween and we arrived about 7. We waited about 5 minutes..maybe longer at the hostess stand with no one in sight. We almost left and went to Applebee's. I wish we would have. Finally get seated and there we sit for another 5-10min before they bring us water. The place was empty. We told her we knew what we wanted before she took off again..and we have a todler so we are always close to a temper tantrum. The food arrived and I had ribs w/mashed & corn,  hubby had  steak & baked potato. My ribs were not very good at all. There was not enough sauce so I waited for our server to come back and check on us and she never did. Hubby had to go and find someone. When the sauce came out it was boiling hot. Very weird. Hubby said steak was ok..not as good as it usually is.  We also had to wait forever for the check. I hope they were having an off night..cuz it will be awhile until I try here again. Which sucks cuz I usually love this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad that was described as having grilled chicken and grilled vegetables over lettuce with cheesy flatbread on the side.
What I got was a mound of iceberg lettuce, raw, chunky carrot sticks and thick bell pepper slices with some little, shriveled slices of zucchini. The flatbread was not bread at all, it was a stale, thin cracker with I kid you not, a little sprinkle of grated cheese in the middle."}
{"text":"Less then mediocre food.  Way overpriced!  By 7 pm all the prime rib was sold out.  One bathroom with a line out the door! How are people supposed to wash their hands: employees.  They wouldn't split check... making the end of the meal a cluster.  It's low class food with a high price in a lousy location. Take your biz off Fremont if you care about the value of your hard earned dollars."}
{"text":"For starters, the host dis not even acknowledge us when we came in. She was just talking to another host the entire time we were standing in front. She didnt even have us follow her to where we would be seated. When we got to the table it was right in the middle of foot traffic (kind of an awkward place to sit at). I really do not like being seated right smack in the middle of a restaurant where EVERYONE seems to watch you eat. We had asked the host if we could have a booth and she said that she did not have any available at the moment. Might I add that our table was right in front of a small kitchen area where they dumped all the plates and utensils, really not an appetizing view. 

Food was alright. Not mouthwatering at all :P"}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service brings my rating up from the one star I was going to give my review of this restaurant. Food quality was very poor. The two lobster tails LOOKED like lobster tails, but tasted like soggy, mushy paper. The mixed vegetables tasted like they came out of a bulk frozen bag of vegetables (fine for a hasty dinner at home, but unacceptable for a restaurant). The small baked potato at least had some flavor, AFTER adding butter, sour cream,  and seasonings. My stomach is still feeling woozy 16 hours after eating at this restaurant. My advice, stay away from seafood in the desert and save it for dining on the coast."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food quality, errors in the order, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesomeness in the medium rare steaks service was outstanding and very moist Cajun Mahi mahi."}
{"text":"Tony Roma's what can be said, not much in comparison. I must admit for first impressions I was really disappointed, I had been waiting for this restaurant for so long and it really did not meet my expectations. Let's start with the one good quality this restaurant has. Service, our server was extraordinary in all aspects, not to mention nice and very detail oriented. Now that's out of the way. This restaurant has so much wrong with it, I'm utterly surprised it was as crowded as it was. The atmosphere, decorations and furniture are extremely outdated, it feels more like a cafeteria, rather than a four star restaurant. The food was no better, portion sizes are small, to feeling nonexistent. I know the rule; quality over size but quality fell in the nonexistent category as well. From the 14oz ribeye with coleslaw and baked potato, to the bacon cheeseburger an American classic that they couldn't even prepare right. The steak was a more done then what was ordered. It's a big difference when you order medium rare but receive well done. From bacon not being fully cooked to fries completely overshadowing the plate. Presentation was horrific, quality was horrific, as well as serving size. You pay for four star quality at this restaurant but receive one star in return. The (1hr 45 minute) wait time was nowhere near worth the wait. Good things do not come to those who wait. My rating a disappointing 1.5 out of 5. My advice avoid Tony Roma's. So many places in Vegas offer everything you're looking for sadly this restaurant is not one of them.

{"text":"Went with the wife for lunch on Thursday, not crowded at all.  The waitress, Nina, was very prompt, courteous and professional.  Had the Kickin' Shrimp starter and it was very good, the presentation might be a bit overboard.  I had the 3 filet meal, all were done to perfection, as ordered, and the sauces were nice.  Overall a very good experience, just short of outstanding."}

it was terrible and food wasn't even that great. not coming again for sure"}
{"text":"If you make it in for their post 9PM specials (read: $12 steak and lobster tail), then maybe this would be worth your while.  Not for me.  My steak was like a piece of rubber.  My date got something that included a lobster tail and it had to be the smallest lobster tail I have ever seen.  The only thing I liked on my plate was the baked potato.  

Only real plus; the service from our waitress was great.  Even though she was clearly overworked with too many tables, she was very attentive.  I think she was a rare case as everyone else working there (including the miser bale hostess) seemed...well, miserable.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a fan of Tony Roma's, but this night, they failed miserably to live up to even the most basic standards of the chain.  Why?  They were understaffed, the meat was over cooked, and they even managed to mess up the baked potatoes.  In over 20 years of coming to Las Vegas, this was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had in the state of Nevada.  Tony Roma would be rolling over in his grave if he knew how bad this place was.  And if Tony Roma is still alive, eating at this place would probably give him a heart attack and that would put him in his grave.  Then, he can roll in it.  Seriously, this place was truly awful.

If you look at most of my reviews, most are very positive because I enjoy going out. But this time, I felt compelled to spread the word and warn others.  The buffet in the Fremont Hotel and Casino is much better."}
{"text":"I've been to Tony Roma's in three different locations and my experience got better and better every time. The first location I went to was inside of a casino on Fremont Street. However, the first time there it wasn't so great as the server was somewhat distracted and the food was just ok (onion loaf was awful). 
The second location was on west sahara, and that's where I tried their ribs. I like the sauce they use for their ribs. It is barbeque based with a great amount of spicy kick to it. Ribs were little overcooked, as they tasted a little bit too chewy for ribs. Service was good.

The third location, the one that's on Stephanie St, offers the best food. The same onion loaf I ordered at the first location was completely different. Unlike the one I got at the fremont location, it was fried to perfection and very crispy. Plus, instead of just regular ranch, it came with the sauce for their ribs. The ribs were much better than the one I had at the second location. Very tender and flavorful, generous amount of sides. My friend got Shrimp Scampi. I tried it and it wasn't good or bad. It was really greasy and I thought the sauce was a little bit too plain. Service was great. Our server was always on top of things, and she was handling good number of tables by herself. If I ever go back to Tony Roma's, I'd go back to this location on Stephanie St."}
{"text":"We used to go to the location on Sahara all of the time when I was younger but stopped going because it seemed their food quality was going down and plus now they closed that location.. So when it was my mom's \"real\" birthday and she said she was craving ribs we decided to check out this location and see if things at TR have improved... It seems they have changed things up a bit here and there.. I feel like the atmosphere of the restaurant has become a lot more casual like Applebee's than I had remembered it to be.. 

At first it seemed our server was going to be a bit douchey but he got better throughout the meal.. They apparently had a special going on for half off of their half slab baby back rib dinner so we got 3 of those and an appetizer sampler.. They got rid of their potato skins in the dining room so BOOO -1!!!!!! The appetizer sampler tasted like something you could get at Denny's but their ribs were actually really tasty! We ordered so much we had to take a lot home which my boyfriend fully enjoyed later haha... The best part of the meal was my citrus habanero margarita... OMG so so so good! I want one right now!!!!!!!!!!

{"text":"This meal was delicious. I have to say. I went with St. Louis ribs and coconut shrimp. My bf ordered St Louis Ribs with chicken. Baby back ribs were $20. .. um no. Going bk to this place was a big deal b/c my bf & I had a huge almost dealbreaking fight @ Tony Roma's in Albuquerque, years ago. So we stayed away due to trama. LOL. So glad we rose above and rib-loving conquered all. This place was great. I had veggies - delish! and cornbread casserole OMG! so good. it was so good it could be counted as desert. The shrimp came with some kind of orange marmalade to dip it in - with real orange zest tasted so fresh. I loved it. I'd definitely go back. I was wearing the LBD and coudnt eat very much but I did enjoy a great glass of riesling with dinner, it was a great night. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Edible, service and servers were kind of awkward. We were checked on ever 10 seconds by 3-4 diff people. Not sure who our real server was, or maybe they just do a tip pool. If you don't catch the special steak price, food is someone expensive for a reg burger and fries, quality is sub par. Silverware and dishes were dirty"}
{"text":"Tony Roma's needs no introduction. This place has been around for years, and prides itself on the reputation of its barbecue cuisine, in particular their ribs.

I have been to this particular restaurant several times over the years, and it very rarely fails to please. The employees are always respectful and do an excellent job, and the atmosphere is considerably more intimate that a lot of other casual dining establishments. 

While they pride themselves on barbecue, the place has a little bit of everything. I have tried a number of their chicken dishes, all of which were very good. During my last visit, I tried the new filet medallions, and they definitely rank as one of the best steak-type products I have tried in a restaurant such as this. They also score points by having potato soup every day and a delicious loaf of onion rings (something I don't even typically eat at other restaurants!) 

The major complaint I have with this place, though, is that the menu is always changing. I love when a restaurant tries to diversify and bring new items to the table - but as a result, too many old, great items have been removed. I hate getting hooked on something (a permanent menu item no less) and then coming in and finding it has been removed from the menu without warning.

But all things considered, it is an excellent casual dining establishment, and has a sense of atmosphere and ambience other casual dining facilities so greatly lack. It is easy to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Last chance and not good.  It's our oldest son's 13th birthday and he loves ribs so we figured we'd give it another try.  My wife got the Memphis burger, she was not asked how she would like it cooked and they brought it out rare!  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was quite dry.  Not very appetizing.  I'm no expert but most other pulled pork sandwiches the meat is simmered in the sauce, this one they plopped the meat down and then put the sauce on top like Arby's would do on their sandwiches.  Management once again was on top of things to take care of the problems and corrected the problems."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. Service was good though. But the food was not very good. If you are a senior then it may be your place."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place. We were doing the Fremont street experience and a bartender recommended this place. The place looked packed and there was a wait, usually a good sign, right? Plus I love ribs!

This dining experience was horrible! Our server was rude and she clearly is in the wrong job. Tips not so great hon? Polish up that resume sweetheart, Cuz working for tips is surely not gonna pay YOUR rent.

Ribs were served barely Luke warm, tender but flavorless. Microwaved fake \"baked\" potatoes that were undercooked. Margarine instead of butter in tiny plastic containers that were impossible to scoop out. Rude waitress said they did not have butter knives to scoop out the crappy margarine. Finally used the other end of fork to get the fake butter out. But what was the point to go through all that effort to put it on a hard potato that you could not eat. I could have put it on the stale rolls, but why bother, as we were not gonna eat those stale rolls anyway.

We did not know whether to laugh or cry. We took our uneaten meal in to go containers and gave it to a homeless guy. I felt bad passing on that meal to the poor unsuspecting soul.

Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Not great. Just cheap.  Steak is small and scrappy looking. And needs steak sauce.  Lobster has no taste and very small. Potato is good. I got $4 soup and it was excellent 

Wait time was an hour not worth it if you are hungry 

It's more of a novelty meal than a real meal. Steak and lobster &11.99 

My son got ribs and chicken tenders and did not like ribs enough to finish them

$8.99 prime rib was gone by the time we ordered 

Wished I could be more positive."}
{"text":"Tony Roma, Rainbow
- 4 Stars for the ribs and margarita; 3 stars for the overall experience.

My wife and I love to go to Tony Roma's for its babyback ribs in various cities. We went to this location (after its renovation) on a Thur evening for Happy Hour and dinner.
- The ribs and margarita were great, as were the hostess and the wait staff. But we did not like its pull pork sandwich - much too bland! The HH was OK but no excitement.

DINNER:
- The babyback ribs ($18, whole slab) were tasty as ever, though the portion seemed to be smaller than usual. The pull pork sandwich ($7.5) was disappointing, however, with a pâté-like texture and a bland taste.

HAPPY HOUR (4-7):
- They have a small, nice bar counter with Sports TV's; no patio seating. One can have HH anywhere in the restaurant besides the bar. For HH drinks, draft beer, $3-4; wine, $4; house margarita, $5. The magarita is delicious.

At the bar coumter, wedid not see many young people: - The atmosphere was kind of low key, quite different from that at the Kona Grill or Gordon Biersch, where it is usually more lively, exciting, noisy, and crowded with people waiting in line. Well, the bar was almost full between 6-7, so Tony Roma must have its own followers.
- I'd guess that people who enjoy the type of happy hour atmosphere at Kona Grill or Gordon Birsch probably would not go out of their way to go to Tony Roma's just for its happy hour only.

The hostess at Tony Roma was cheerful and pleasant. The wait staff was friendly and attentive.
- We'll be back, for its delicious babyback ribs, but won't be going there just fot its happy hour.

{"text":"At the end of our Vegas trip we decided to go to Fremont Street, explore something new, and see all the lights we always see in all those old movies. We were starving and saw Tony Roma's special lit up on a sign and figured why not?

I've only been to Tony Romas once before, years ago and this is one was alot different to the one I remember. We were seated right away which was nice, the place was filled with big groups (more families, etc).

I got their 'famous' Baby Back Ribs with a Baked Potato on the side. Yes, I might be tiny but I can eat A-lot:) They were good but nothing extraordinary and the potato was kind of cold.

A little dissapointed, but I guess thats what you get at a steak house in a beat up hotel on Fremont Street! 

p.s.-Did I mention how terrible our waiter was? BLAH."}
{"text":"Worst service of my life on my husband's birthday.This place truly sucks. I asked if they did anything for birthdays and said no not really. Which means \"I'm lazy and won't do anything\" worthless place and worthless service"}
{"text":"We all decided on ribs tonight and I remembered seeing this Tony Roma's in downtown Las Vegas. I really enjoyed this eatery when I was back home in Hawaii and also in Redondo Beach CA, which has since closed down. 

The place was packed but we were seated in no time. Our server brought our drinks out quickly and I was actually impressed seeing how busy it was. 

We ordered steak, pork ribs, and chicken. My plate came out and I specifically asked for dark meat chicken. The server was so nice that she went out of her way to get the dark meat after claiming it was Chefs choice for the chicken type. Ive been here too many times to know that she was incorrect. Nonetheless, it was rectified.

Our server was very polite, friendly and quick to attend to our needs. I like how she checked up on us and asked if we needed her service. The food came out fresh and tasty, at least mine did. My friends claimed their steaks were ok and so this review is really on my personal experience and food I ate. 

Foodies, this place was decent and I left satisfied. Try it out, you might like it."}
{"text":"I live downtown, and go here every week or two for takeout. I guess because of the neighborhood, they don't take phone orders, so I need to order in person. 

Went in last night and ordered. Sat at the bar as always to wait. Virtually no one in the place but was totally ignored by the bartenders.  

My wife always gets the same thing...potato skins and mozzarella sticks.  I think they're meh, but she loves them, which is why I go there. I always get something different...last night I got the ribeye, which I've had before, but last night was kind of blah...tough and flavorless. Hey, I love their ribs, so will continue to go, especially since the Mrs. likes their skins."}
{"text":"They get one star because the food was good.
But wow there service is so bad! We were there last year and had the same experience but wanted to give them another chance. Bad call!
The waitress was horrible and even forgot the extra dressing for the salads . When asked about it we got a reply of \" oh yea, well it should have enough on it\" and still never got the dressing.
When it was time to pay we were told to go up front since they were busy and could not ring us up. Then when we asked the bartender to ring the bill he told us he was not part of the restaurant and go over there as he tossed the bill back. When we were leaving thinking this was 2 hours we lost and won't get back guess who's standing out front handing out numbers to people and taking names . Yes the Manager . Not the hostess or another employee but the man who should be watching and making sure the customer service is being met. Tony Roma's really needs some help and all 8 of us will never go back!"}
{"text":"The last time I'd set foot in Tony Roma's was probably about 1988. Last night I revisited with my Grandparents and wondered why it'd been that long. 
I LOVE ribs, but rarely get them out at restaurants because they are full of fat. I'd rather wait until summer Ribfests for some good ribs, but Tony Roma's bridged the gap nicely last night.
I had their ribs with the original sauce which was nice (nothing special), but the ribs themselves were nice and meaty...barely any fat so mouthfuls of grease were avoided.
Their french fries were well done and to me? Amazing...but they had a certain flavour to them that I couldn't put my finger on....after a few more, I realized I was tasting the fish from their Fish & Chips that probably gets cooked in the same oil. I don't have a problem with this. Some people do, but I look at it as a two-for-one. 
What sealed the deal for me on this place though, was that my Grandparents go there 2-3 times a week and split a half-rack meal. They said that they'd gone in the other day and the chef recognized their meal ticket and gave them both half-racks since they come in so often. Treating my grandparents right guarantees you a fan in me, that's for sure. 
Nice and quiet atmosphere, too. High-walled booths make it so that you can't see or hear anyone around you which is great, especially when there's screaming babies around."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years, and still pretty good! Prices were a bit much from what I remember, and there wasn't much to choose from on the menu.

I ordered some short ribs, being the classy bitch I am. I got some big ball of meat smothered in peppers which was fuckin delish. And only 17 dollars. I recommend that to anyone who goes to this place, it's the best. It wasn't till I was halfway through this juicy rib slab that I remembered I was a vegan. Oops. So much for that new years resolution.

The staff is super friendly and even engaged in some interesting conversation with us, since it was pretty late and the place was practically empty.

My only complaint is that they put bacon on the mashed potatoes. Potatoes are the food of gods but I HATE BACON STRIPS AND BACON STRIPS"}
{"text":"I can't give this restaurant more than two stars. Great waitress, but the food was below standard for its price. Ordered half BBQ chicken, tons of gristle, not much meat on it. Just underwhelmed by the quality of food. That and one of the hostess', rather than using the intercom to announce orders kept yelling them out. Very annoying."}
{"text":"This place only earned two stars because the food is alright.  The service isn't worth two stars.

I have eaten at Tony Roma's twice (or attempted to, anyway).  The first time, I swore I wouldn't go back because the food wasn't that great for the price and the service was pretty lacking.  However, today we couldn't pick a place to have lunch and we were right by the restaurant, so we decided to give it another try.

When we walked in, the place was pretty much dead inside.  It was about 1 p.m., so we were expecting to find a little bit of a lunch crowd.  Regardless, we waited six minutes at the hostess stand to get a table.  The bartender noticed we were standing there a long time and went to the back and bellowed at someone to come seat us.  Still, time kept ticking on with no one seating us.  By this time, there was a line all the way out both sets of glass double doors.  Waitress after waitress walked by without even glancing our way or assuring us there would be someone coming by to seat us.  Six minutes... I kid you not.  So we left, as did most of the people behind us.  It was insane.  Never again.  Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"$12.99 steak and lobster caught our attention...BIG MISTAKE!  The steak was the toughest piece of meat I ever have had!  And mine was medium rare! Go to ELLIS ISLAND for their steak special for $8.99. All the locals go there and so will we whenever we're in town!"}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE Tony Roma's, always have. We used to live in Seattle and they all closed down there a few years ago. We just moved to LV and we so happy to see they are still around. Love the pulled pork sandwiches, ribs, and chicken strips! Never had a bad thing there. The best sauce is the Blue Ridge Smokies. Ask for it you won't be sorry! Also my wife loves their honey mustard on just about everything. :-) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years because I know where to get real BBQ. But one of my students gave me a gift card for here so I came by to eat for dinner. 
I ordered the fish and fries and it was wonderful! Crispy and hot and the fish had a nice flavour and texture. The slaw was also very nice! My only negative is no malt vinegar? If you're going to have fish and chips on the menu then you need malt vinegar! Potions size was also huge and for a decent price. 
Got a piece of chocolate layer cake to take home! Yum!
Thanks, kids, for the awesome gift!"}
{"text":"Brought the family here last night after not visiting a Tony Roma's in about 2 yrs. Decided to give it another try. Not very crowded. 

***Our waitress was great; very attentive. 

We all ordered different varities of meals.
Husband: Chicken Alfredo Pasta. Cheese smelled really rotten. He said his meal was not good at all.
Daughter: Chicken salad, she said this was the only salad that she's ever had that tasted weird. (Not sure if I should count her opinion) lol
Son: Kid's ribs. He liked them
Me: Ordered Chicken with Pineapple salsa. Sweet mashed potatoes & broccoli. There is really something to be said if the broccoli is the best thing on your plate. My food was not good. The pineapple salsa & the sweet mashed tasted like dish detergent...No exaggeration! The sweet mashed looked old & dry. Not edible looking at all. My son passed his up at first sight. My husband tasted it and agreed with me.
Also had the Sangria: Tasted flat. Very flat! 
Overall, I feel like I was robbed of $60 + dollars. We will definetly NOT be returning...Ever!!!"}
{"text":"They have a super cheap lunch menu. I'm talking like $9 for a sirloin steak. My favorite menu item is the BBQ Brisket sandwich. The Brisket is sometimes a little fatty...but it is yum! (and it's only $7.00). And here is a fun fact if you go in on your birthday they give you a FREE bottle of BBQ sauce and a coupon for a free onion loaf on your next visit. And speaking of onion loaf all I can say is YUM. It is the best of all the fried onion apps out there. I have never been here at dinner or on the weekend. And  the service is hit or miss. This is not an in and out in an hour place (more like an hour and fifteen minutes kinda deal). But it is close to downtown and it is nice to change it up every once in a while."}
{"text":"Best RIbs?  I don't think so...  these ribs are completely covered in sugar. If you don't like BBQ sauce and would rather your meat cooked with spice that enhances it's natural flavour,  stay away from this chain.  They wouldn't even serve me plain ribs as I'd rather have put a touch of salt on and ate them plain. Even Swiss Chalet will serve ribs without the sauce if you ask.

The best ribs are usually at little korean places. THey know how to enhance flavour rather than overpower it."}
{"text":"Went here when we got in town. Everything was old or frozen or just not fresh I was told good food it so wasnt. Waitress was rude had no sense of customer service we were pretty much abandoned worst service and wasnt even busy."}
{"text":"Note to self: $11.99 steak is inedible, lobster was small but edible. The baby backs were good tho and so Was our waitress."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time! Food was not good, service was slow, and you will smell like cigarette smoke. Food was not as advertised."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Had gone to a Tony Roma's in Tennessee and it was very good. Went to the Las Vegas location and the food was just ok. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come back. The food was just so-so. Server was nice and efficient but didn't go out of her way to make us feel at home. It was busy so I totally understand. Meat deals were kind of expensive without their special so just stuck to a sandwich but they barely put any sauce on it. Their signature bbq isn't all that great either."}
{"text":"Absolutely garbage. Over cooked greasy kicking shrimp. Slimey roasted veggies. Soggy broccoli. Worst Tony's I've ever ate at! Never again."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night, but have been hearing about this place for years.  Passing by I always thought this was an Italian place because of the name Tony Roma's but its more of a Steakhouse with a little bit of everything, and known for there Ribs.  Strangely enough I ended up getting a pasta dish....lol. I had the Chicken Pasta Linguine which was new to menu.  I have to say it was quite yummy.  My friends had the Ribs of course, and said they were outstanding.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was good, and the waitress was very attentive. I don't see myself coming back anytime soon, but definitely would go if someone else recommended it."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Tony Roma's in Las Vegas.  Being from So Cal, there are several around but haven't ate at one for several years.  Now I know why.
We ate at the Las Vegas-Fremont location on 8/28 for dinner only because we were invited by our friends that LOVE this restaurant and make it a tradition to go here when they visit Las Vegas.  There were eight of us.  It was about 5:30 and not crowded.  We were seated in a few minutes.
Service was fair.  Server was courteous and efficient.
I ordered the Baby Back Ribs Tony Roma size at $19.  Got cole slaw and a baked potato.
I asked for spicy sauce.
The ribs were below average and not very meaty, sauce was not spicy at all.  Baked potato and cole slaw was fair.
We were given some bread.  It was dry.  The butter they offer is not butter but very small \"Promise\"  margarine containers in a basket!  Are you kidding?  It took me about five containers for my baked potato and two for my roll.
Butter should be on the plate in a container with the sour cream(got this).  Margarine should be an option for those that don't use butter.

In summary, Tony Roma's is a below average overpriced restaurant.  There are many other restaurants in this city.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This was our go to spot however after our last experiance in the lounge we have not returned and im not sure what would bring us back !! Food usually great. Our server forgot out food. Forgot our drinks. Made horrible drinks. Turned music right up than sat and skipped thru songs whilst holding an amazingly inappropriate conversation . Forgot we were there. Found us eventually it was honestly the worst restraunt experiance of my life... this was about a year ago and it takes my strength not to go back for them medalions but principal manages to win"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, I had the appetizer sampler platter and ate the whole thing. It was so good!"}
{"text":"So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  

Server was good, but my filet medallion was off . A second filet medallion was undercooked. By this time I was done with my ribs,which were very tasty, and my sides and I asked to see the manager. The manager gave an apology and only charged for the ribs. okay, but won't be going back soon . 

My Strawberry Limeade,an alcoholic beverage, was great!"}
{"text":"Good luck getting in. Thurs night 9pm there is a mob of 500 people outside the door and just inside at the host stand. Complete bedlom with no direction. No employees anywhere. What a mess."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a long time...last time was maybe 2 years ago at the Lake Mead/Rainbow location. It wasn't that good so we weren't in a hurry to eat at TR....however on this night we decided we were hungry for onion loaf.  They only have one size now....$4 for a small. I was disappointed because we can easily eat a large! Also they no longer have onion bread, now it's like a loaf of white bread and herbed butter...miss the onion bread. Even the entrees are different. Not good but not bad. I miss the old style TR....not liking this newer version. Their kids
Menu also is a bit boring -- not really too much selection. Overall it was an ok meal but I just wish they wouldn't have changed so much of what I grew up loving.  This location is better than all the others!"}
{"text":"My friend loves the place but leaves 3/4 of the food on the plate I found it to be assembly line food to the highest degree. If you're paying, I'm going. That's how far I go with this place."}
{"text":"First off, we waited 20 minutes for a table and the hostess was not very friendly about the special that she had rudely let us know was already over for the night. We were seated in an awkward place, right smack middle of the restaurant and the center of the place, also right next to another couple. Not comfortable seating at all! A positive of the situation was that once we were seated we were greeted by Pamela who was very pleasant, nice and good at her job. We were disappointed that the menu was on the small side of choices and they did not have Prime Rib as an option on Saturday night. Boo. Be mindful that this is an okay option for dinner if you are staying around there but do not count on it for more than that."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  The food is nasty and has absolutely NO flavor!  This is the worst Tony Roma's I have ever visited!  Ordered a steak medium well.  It was overcooked and DRY!!!  The vegetable medley that came with the meal was some frozen vegetables that I wouldn't feed my 3 year old grandchild. 

If I could rate this place 0-star, I would!  They need to totally revamp this place or possibly get rid of it...total waste of space!"}
{"text":"I hardly see my folks during the week, even though I live fairly close to them.  So, we have decided to make Sunday nights our time to catch up and gossip about the family.  Good times!  I am also going to let them choose where we go, because I hate playing the let's try something new game with them.  They like places that are tried and true... places they have heard of at least.  So, one of those places is Tony Roma's.  I have no problems with that, as I am not a food snob and I don't care about it being a chain.  Just, as long as the food is decent and we get good service.  Anyhow, here is my review for our experience last night.  

And, just in case you haven't read any of my other reviews, my folks love to eat early.  5 pm early!!!

 - I meet them in the parking lot where there are barely any cars.  So, parking was obviously plentiful.

 - We make our way inside where we were greeted at the hostess stand.  We were seated right away by the friendly hostess.

 - I usually head to the bathroom to wash up before dinner.  I can be a bit of a germaphobe.  The bathroom was clean, if that means anything.

 - I get back to the table at the same time our drink order was being taken and the specials were being read.  And, we were given time to check out the menu.

* Side note: I don't know how many other families are like mine but the banter of reading the menu is ridiculous.  A lot of \"Oooh! this looks good\" and \"Did you see this... I'm thinking about getting this\"  When in reality, I know you are just going to get some kind of steak with fries or a potato.  

 - We order... you guessed it.  Steaks with some kind of potato.  Our soup and salads come out.  We were checked up on quite a bit and were told that our steaks were going to take a while.  I figured because, my aunt has to have hers burnt to a crisp.  No sight of red...

 - Eventually our meals come out and the waitress asked us to cut them open to see if everything is alright.  I like my meat bloody so I have no problems.  My aunt asked them to fire hers up for a little longer.  So, they took her steak back and was brought out again by one of the cooks to make sure it was fine... It was.

 - Now the part of the evening I hate the most... the silence while eating.  There is nothing I hate more than the sound of food being eaten.  It kind of grosses me out.  Don't judge!!!

 - The bill came out to 120 bucks for the 4 of us, which consisted of our meals and a couple of drinks from the bar.  We tip out 20%.  I always make sure of it as I have worked in the service industry over my years.

 - As we were leaving the hostess grabs the door for us and asks us to come again.

Overall it was a good night."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. Great location. Great service. Had the flat iron with asparagus, bacon and pearl onions for $17. Delish! I recommend the loaded mash potatoes. Not really a potato fan but these were so good!"}
{"text":"The 1st Tony Roma's I had ever been to was in Okinawa, Japan of all places.  After eating primarily Asian food for 2 straight years, the ribs there tasted like HEAVEN.  Both my wife and I were curious if it was just that particular dinner or if Tony Roma's was really that good.  It was definitely the former.  Not a terrible place but not that great either.  I would go with Memphis Championship BBQ any day of the week over this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving ribs and for some strange reason we went here. Both food and service were mediocre. Also the restaurant its self could use a major update!"}
{"text":"I have fond memories of Tony Roma's when I was really young.  My grandparents used to take my whole family here in Beverly Hills a few times a year, it was my absolute favorite meal growing up.  My parents literally shoved health food down my throat all the time, and eating here (and Hamburger Hamlet) was one of the few times we could go crazy.

However, Tony Roma's today is a shell of what it used to be back then.  The ribs are still ok and I still think their original sauce is one of the best ever (because I grew up eating it), but it doesn't have that upscale coolness it once had like going to Ruth Chris's steakhouse or some of the other upscale chains.  Now, Tony Roma's is more on par of the Olive Garden, and it makes me sad.

This location is still ok.  I went here with my husband because I was feeling nostalgic for comfort food from my childhood.  I was disappointed of course for the reasons stated above, but for a chain restaurant they still do an ok job.  I saw they changed the Onion Loaf, it just isn't as good as it used to be and they changed the shape so it isn't really an onion loaf anymore, it is more of an onion bowl or something.  

Would I recommend this place?  eh I don't know, I guess so.  I haven't tried enough BBQ in this town to recommend something else.  However, I have tried Memphis Championship BBQ and I think Tony Roma's babyback ribs are far superior."}
{"text":"This Tony Roma's is located inside a Vegas casino and is nothing like any of the other Tony Roma's restaurants I have been to.

All of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.

I feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?

Firstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says \"Only $8.99!\"

After you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated. 

She asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says \"30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight.\"

Are they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!

I was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.   

We stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?

Once we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.

I really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes. 

What a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.

At least the entrée was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert. 

During dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.

My boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.

Very classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly. 

I will never make the mistake of coming to this particular Tony Roma's ever again."}
{"text":"Had a burger here recently and it was actually very good, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  As you can see, this location gets a lot of bad reviews.

-cheap cut of tough steaks.  Buy better grade steaks!
-rude wait staff.  Train them or get new ones.
-cooks over cooking steaks, wasteful when they're sent back.  Train the cooks or hire new ones.  And buy better beef.  Can't work miracles with a cheap product.  Steaks should be restaurant quality \"choice\" grade.  Believe it or not it takes about a full year for a cook to master grilling steaks correctly.
-steak and lobster special.  DISCONTINUE!  Epic Failure!  If you want to continue hearing complaints then keep it on the menu.  Doesn't even matter if you charge 5.99, it's still not good.

I've owned two restaurants.  You'll never please everyone, but these issues can be fixed.  Just gotta fix it!  Great hamburgers!  If you want repeat customers things have to change.  Just consider those customers who don't know about Yelp?  Otherwise there'd be many more complaints."}
{"text":"we went there for lunch and they have a pretty nice lunch menu. i had their steakhouse burger and it was pretty tasty! would definitely go again because the price was definitely right."}
{"text":"Found ourselves on Freemont St. late at night and hadn't had dinner yet so we werent expecting a great steak or lobster for $11.99 but we were so surprised at how delicious it was.  Steak was tender and the lobster was really good.  You must stop and get it if you are there!!"}
{"text":"I've been to several other Tony Roma's and they were all pretty great, but this one was THEE worst restaurant I have ever been to!! If I could have given it \"0\" stars I would have.  They told us the the wait for a seat was 45 mins, no problem, it was in a casino so we figured we could entertain ourselves at the bar.   About 50 mins later, we had a Margarita at their bar (if you want to call it that), it was $7.50 for a Margarita and it was HORRIBLE!  We spoke to the bartender about it and he just didn't care. 1 hr and 15 mins later we were seated, then were asked to move to another table because THEY had sat us in a table for 5 instead of two.  Our waiter totally ignored us, took forever to take our order, then, AT LEAST 45 mins later we finally got our $11.99 steak and lobster.  This was AFTER we saw at least 5 other parties of people get THEIR food and they had arrived WAY after we did.  He realized that a mistake had been made and instead of giving us our order, he kept giving them away to everyone else!!!!! I finally called the Manager over, she apologized and said our order would come right up. NOT, it still took at least 15 -20 mins to get it.  I am normally a really good customer and tip VERY WELL because I know how hard waiters and bartenders work, but this time we just couldn't tip.  They didn't offer to comp us anything, only said they would buy us dessert if we wanted it.  Dessert?  Really?  I practically ran out of the place!  DO NOT GO TO THIS TONY ROMA'S!!! It is HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"For the price, great prime rib and lobster, the horseradish was extreme but so good! Very busy but the service was excellent. The drinks are strong! Which is always a plus!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. The steak had no flavor and was dry. My friend had ribs...which were burnt. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for meat, Tony Roma's is the place to go.  They have some of the best steaks, burgers, and of course, their world famous ribs.

You'll soon see why the complimentary bib they give you is a necessity.  Their ribs are so saucy and delicious you're bound to get it all over your face and clothes.  Just go feral and eat like the cave people did; they didn't care if they had food on their face or bodies.  At Tony Roma's you should leave your pride at the door and eat like an animal.

You won't be leaving this place hungry with the amount of food you get on your plate.  More often than not I have to take a doggie bag home with me because I can't finish my meal.  It makes great lunch the next day, when I still have Tony's on the taste buds!

Tony Roma's is known world-wide as the pioneers of baby-back ribs.  It doesn't surprise me that they are still the leading restaurant for ribs and steak.  Tony's really does hit the spot when you're craving some mouth-watering meat... it just falls right off the bones!"}
{"text":"So, I don't know if it's because I'm a North girl, or because this location really is worse, but I prefer the Crowfoot Tony Roma's to this one.

I find the atmosphere in this Tony's to be somewhat bland.  I mean, sure, they have the same colours and general set-up, but there's something about it that isn't quite as welcoming as other locations.

I found the service at this particular Tony's to be a little slower and sub-par.  We weren't once asked how our meal was during the entire course of eating.  There wasn't anything wrong with the food, but it's nice to know the server cares.

The food is still amazing though.  I love that you get a little bib when you order the ribs!  And their mashed potatoes are pretty much to die for.

Sadly, since the food quality doesn't vary much from store-to-store, I'll probably be sticking with my Northern location.  Sorry Tony's South, you just didn't quite cut it for me!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place only has 2.5 stars -what were people expecting? Old Vegas steakhouse with moderate prices -it was decent. Our server was great and I wish I could remember her name. She was a tiny thing and a hustler! Our drinks were never empty thanks to her assistant. Dinner was what I expected. I wasn't blown away but it was by no means a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Great Location and Menu choice, please clean the menu's. First one had someone else's food stuff all over the inner pages as did the second one. Gotta go wash now!"}
{"text":"Ewww is how I felt about the food when it hit our table. My boyfriend order a chicken spinach dish. The vegetables was old looking and tasted like it was freezer burned. The spinach concoction looked mike my Jr. High science experiment on decomposition, and the chicken was like rubber. The steak dinner was overpriced and just nasty. The customer service was great though, but not enough to make up for the awful food."}
{"text":"SEAN is one of the top food servers I have ever met. His customer service will have me continuing to eat at Tony Roma's in Fremont every time I visit Vegas. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Literally the worse meal I have ever had in Vegas....ever.

I reaaalllly wish I had looked up the Yelp rating before we ended up here, but we were hungry and my phone wasn't working, and it is a chain, so I thought, how bad can it be? Mistake #1

Mistake #2? Ordering the lobster...I know, I know, ridiculous to think I would get decent lobster here, but my husband knows I love it and again, I thought, how bad can it be? BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD First of all it was 22.99 and I swear the two lobster tails were each the size of my husbands finger. If they hadn't come attached to shells, I would have thought they were large shrimp. They looked terrible, but I was so hungry, so I gave it a shot. First one, WAY WAY overcooked, took two bites to finish the whole tail. Second one? Took one bite and thought \"I am going to be throwing up tonight\" It was horrific, and made my stomach lurch immediately, so no finishing that one. 

While the lobster was definitely the defining bad moment of dinner, I will also add that I asked for garlic mashed potatoes instead of baked potato, got baked potato, had to ask for the mashed and once they came my stomach was so rocky from the lobster, I couldn't eat much, but they were pretty salty and not that great. Also asked for rolls, three times, finally got them and frankly that was about all I ate just to have something on my stomach. 

Sooo, the best thing I can say is, I did not end up sick that night, which I feel is some kind of a miracle given what that lobster tasted like. I guess I will add that my husband's burger was fine, so there is that I suppose, but I refuse to give more than one star to this place. The staff was nice, but incredibly slow and like I mentioned above, screwed up my order and really didn't want to bring those rolls. Dinner was $50 and I am still insanely irritated that we even paid it. I should have talked to a manager, but we just wanted to get the heck out of there and try to salvage the rest of our night. 

Do yourself a favor and DO NOT eat here. You could pick up a candy bar from the store down the street and have a better dinner."}
{"text":"Stopping across the parking lot to go to another store, our noses drug my wife and me across the parking lot toward the building emitting such delicious scents. Neither of us had eaten at a Tony Roma's before, but had heard good things, figured we would give it a shot since we were extremely hungry.

Opening the doors allowed us to get a full on assault of amazing food smells. This was looking to be a good dinner!

The decor was modern, clean, well lit and laid out pretty nice. We walked in, and I leaned against the hostess stand while waiting for said hostess. Five minutes later, in a half empty restaurant, the hostess walked by and said she would be with us shortly. Another minute or two later, we were finally seated.

Of course, we got put in the one booth near the bar that did not have a view of the TV, which was a good thing for the wife, for me however, I wanted to watch the World Series. It's OK though, I saw a reflection in a piece of framed art and caught some of the game.

It took OVER TEN MINUTES for our server to acknowledge us. We were in the process of standing up to leave when she finally came over and introduced herself. Being that we had so long to wait, we knew what we wanted, placed our orders then she was off. 

Once she walked away, her co-worker walked by and asked if she got us taken care of, said \"she's slow, but she has two kids, gotta love her.\" Excuse me? We are supposed to sit here as our stomachs try to eat their way out of our bodies because she has two kids and doesn't know how to do her job? The restaurant WAS NOT anywhere approaching busy, let alone slammed. She should be as hungry for tips as we were for dinner being that she has two kids.

The menu, of course, made the 3 course special appear to be a great deal with generous portions. It was only 1/3 inaccurate. 

I will only review my food, as I am sure the wife will post up on hers soon.

I ordered the 3 course for $15 with the half boneless wing/chicken finger appetizer, shrimp pasta and the brownie dessert.

Following her initial ten minute delay in talking to us, our appetizers came out pretty quick, surprisingly quick even. The chicken was tender, breaded nicely and tasted good.

A short while after finishing the appetizers our meals came out, their timing was pretty spot on. Diving into the shrimp pasta, I was one, maybe two bites in before I noticed something odd. Picking away at the dish, I found a sticker in my food, one of those that kitchens use to mark when the food was either prepped or needs to be tossed.

We showed it to the server, she was shocked (of course) and kept eating. A few moments later, she said the manager took my pasta off the ticket, which was not really necessary, but an appreciated move.

Dinner was done, we were stuffed, but still had dessert to go. Out came my brownie and ice cream dish. Now, the pictures had thick, fresh made brownies, overall a 2-3x larger amount of food than appeared before me. In hindsight, this is probably a good thing as we were STUFFED. I just get frustrated with thinking I am getting a good sized portion and get a small snack instead.

Our drinks were only refilled one time during the meal, again, if she has two kids to take care of, provide good service so you get better tips.

Finally, the check was delivered. Looking at it, when the manager removed my shrimp pasta, he manipulated the entire ticket so the cheaper items from the 3 course meals were on the wife's 3 for $15 deal, and we paid for the individual, more expensive other items. I understand that the manager is supposed to make money for the restaurant, however, when you have a customer that received food labels in their meal and you voluntarily remove the main course and manipulate the ticket so we pay the same amount as if it was there, that is just... disappointing.

We ordered 2 x 3 for $15 meals and one soda. The expected ticket would have been around $35-37. We were charged $31 and change. If the shrimp pasta meal is really only a $4.00 meal, I will be eating there every night!

They get 3 stars for tasty food, but lose 2 for the server being very lackluster, other staff making excuses for her lackluster, and the manager making a superficial removal of my dinner from the ticket."}
{"text":"i personally have been to this particular Tony Romas restaurant plenty of times, and every time it was great. The service, the food and the atmosphere. My favourite dish is the baby back ribs :) Other peoples reviews seem to be different than mine, but its each one to their own I guess !"}
{"text":"Got into the restaurant at 1pm, and it was pretty well empty. Server seemed a bit disorganized, especially when more tables arrived. After ordering, it took over 45 minutes to arrive. Tables arriving after us ordered appetizers and got that before we even got our meal. There were only 4 tables that were being served and June (asst mgr?) had to step in and assist. Food-wise, it was just ok. The fish & chips was okay; fish was nice & very firm, chips were lukewarm, coleslaw was runny. The Potato Soup and featured Daily Sandwich - Soup was good but lukewarm. Featured Sandwich was an open-faced Well-Done Prime Rib on a piece of PLAIN bread (not toasted or anything) I've been to the Barlow location before and liked it much much more. Too bad Crowfoot. Was it because we used a Birthday Coupon worth $15??"}
{"text":"A great meal:
Carolina honey sauce on the St Louis or baby back ribs
Green beans
Loaded mashed potatoes

Get a half price lemon drop martini during happy hour!

Service was great, too

Enjoying my leftovers today ;-)"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken salad I had was really good. Very fresh tasty and plentiful. The little tortilla strips gave my bites a nice crunch and the little tomatoes were yummy. Our waitress was extremely cool and nice. So yay for her! :D We came in after the restaurant was supposed to be closed, but they were still letting some people in. My friend really liked the half BBQ chicken. It was tender and moist. Came with a side of coleslaw and french fries. We pretty much cleaned up our plates."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant on this planet, the managers have NO concept of customer service. We had to wait for our food for over 40 minutes, a large table of 8 + people got their food ahead even though they were seated at least 15 minutes after us. When I complained to the manager she told she will check up on our food, when our food finally came it was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for a long time. The manager offered us a dessert for our table mind you we were party of 4. Worst ever restaurant save your money and mood and eat at any other place but this awful place."}
{"text":"I received a discount card of $19.00 just by joining the Birthday Club at Tony Roma's.  $19.00 is not too bad a discount, methinks!   You must use it during your birthday week. Our table ordered:

- Tony cut - Prime Rib - ordered it rare - it came out slightly pink all round the thick cut of meat.  It was quite good and I enjoyed it.  Sometimes when you order rare prime rib, it comes out with the blood still oozing.  This prime rib dish had no blood oozes whatsoever but the meat was still juicy and very tender.  The dish also came with a little bowl of au jus.  Had the 2 sides of garlic mashed potatoes (need more garlic flavour) and seasonal vege (steamed brocolli - quite green and tasty).  Don't forget to ask for horse radish.

- Linguine and meatballs - quite good.  Meatballs of good size and quite tasty as was the tomato sauce.  Maybe need more garlic in the tomato sauce.

- St Louis Ribs - 1/2 rack - Tender and juicy pork ribs - delicious - ate with 2 sides of beans and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was quite tasty and freshly made.

- Beef Short Rib - a chunk of meat with the bone in the middle.  The meat fell off the bone!  It was THAT tender and moist, braised to perfection!  It was braised in a nice brown sauce. Supposed to come with garlic mashed potato and roasted vege but switched the mashed potato for baked potato.  I would order this dish the next time I hit Tony Roma's!  

Wait Service - Very courteous and fast.  Great wait service!"}
{"text":"I was drawn into this place because I've eaten at Tony Roma's in other states and always loved the food/service; as well as, the signs on the outside of the building about their steak & lobster specials. We were seated right away...but also fairly close to the front (therefore the heavy smoke from in the casino followed us in and hung out while we tried to dine). I did not see any of the specials that were listed on the outside sign. Didn't bother asking about them since I was dining with some people I didn't know super well. I ordered the sirloin steak; garlic mashed; and corn on the cob. The best part was the mashed potatoes (once I added a little salt & pepper) and used the sour cream with each bite. The steak was not very tender or tasty. The corn was extremely bland (had to add butter and salt to that as well). Once we were done and I handed the waiter my card to pay, he literally disappeared for about 15 minutes. I was about ready to get the manager. It was ridiculous how long I had to wait to get my card back and sign to get away from the mediocre food and nasty smoke. I will NEVER come back to this place if I ever do come back to Vegas. Nobody in my party was impressed which was a huge disappointment for me since I paid for everyone."}
{"text":"The Prime Rib Special runs from 4:30 to 6:30.  

Steak & Lobster Special is served from 9-11pm.

I'm not sure how full the other Fremont restaurants are during these times, but these specials are so popular, the Hostess gives out #s from 4:30-5:30, then stops ~ & from 8:30 till 10pm.

My Lobster was very good but the Steak was chewy.  I ate the Lobster 1st, so it was late in the game when I cut into the steak.  Should have sent it back, but my friends were almost finished with their meals.  

Ribs are a favorite item ~ my friend's order was tender & juicy.  

Servers work 7 hours straight with no breaks & are fast & accommodating."}
{"text":"The meal wasn't great but it wasn't bad. My friend and I shared the calamari, the sampler entree which came with a mix of all their ribs. All entrees unless otherwise stated comes with 2 sides, so we ordered fries, upgraded one side to the Mac n cheese for $3 and added a starter salad for an additional $4. We chooses tony Roma's original sauce for the ribs, the sauce was great, but the ribs themselves were dry. Wednesday is wine Wednesdays and you can get a 6 oz glass for $6. Overall a hearty meal, but just eh when it comes to quality. Our server was great, very attentive and friendly. Bill came to $65 before adding tip, and I had a $50 gift card. I don't think I would spend my own money to eat here, so I was thankful for my gift card."}
{"text":"I love businesses that remain authentic to their credo. Tony Roma's is everything I want in a casino restaurant: quirky decor, pop-your-eyes-out deals and decent service. The $11.99 steak and lobster special is awesome, although I must recommend spending an extra $8 to have a $20 steak and two lobster tails dinner. It's worth checking out if you have time and want a fun place on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Once again we went back to TR for the steak n lobster ... of course  on that location more often  than the ribs ...lol  if you go to the smith's  about the same $$$$
At least I can do my steak the way I want it .... soft med  rare with out putting any wheithg on the steak to cook faster .... but well  we been there a lot ... Never we felt welcome. ...

{"text":"I have to honestly say that I didn't really enjoy my late lunch here.  The place was dead and the music was blaring, which really turned me off from the get go.  

I came with one of my girls and her 2 kids and my 2 kids and proceeded to look through the extensive menu.  Tony offers up a lot to choose from but nothing really caught my fancy, I also didn't feel like ribs at 2 in the afternoon so decided on a light salad.  It was a grilled veggie salad with greens and a southwesty type dressing with grilled chicken on top.  The chicken was not really seasoned and tasted boiled more-so than grilled and there was not enough grilled veg, mostly lettuce greens.

My friend ordered this shrimp cocktail looking thing which was actually an appetizer but perfect for lunch, it was really good.

Kids had typical kid fare, no complaints there but the server was a complete bore.  Not really friendly, nor pleasant.  Found her really dry and not really tuned in.  I really hate it when a server hates their job and is miserable during my dining experience.

Food came out quick, all things considered there were only like 3 tables there.

Would I come back?  Maybe if I was invited, but the waitress completely ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Food was pretty basic and we're left unsatisfied. I've need paid $30 for a piece of steak (after they stopped serving the prime rib which was the whole reason we came), and had to chew so much. It was what I would imagine a dog goes thru gnawing on a chew toy. It was rough! I got tired like 3 bites in having to chew that much. Their French Onion soup was broth with croutons sprinkled over it and a slice of sandwich cheese layered on top. It was sad and not worth the $280 we had to pay."}
{"text":"We usually have to wait close to an hour for a table on a Saturday night, but this weekend the wait was only 10 - 20 minutes.  I don't know if it is the ecomony or the food, but it was unusual.  It's Tony Romas, so what can we say.  It is a restaurant chain located inside a casino in Downtown Las Vegas.  The food tastes pretty much the same as any other Tony Romas.  The wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  The ribs were great (4 of us had ribs), and we added their red hot BBQ sauce, which made it yummy.  My mom had the prime rib special and she was happy.  We started with the onion loaf, which is a treat for onion lovers."}
{"text":"The staff was great.
the food was ok.
the drinks were pretty terrible. 

I drank my water and ate the food. evidently we weren't the first to say anything because at the first mention of the bad drink the waitress apologized and took it off the bill. 
we went there because we knew the name and wanted good food. Next time, ill go someplace I don't know the name I guess."}
{"text":"I don't get how Tony Roma's stays in business unless they are busier at dinner time because at lunch time during the week they are normally dead.

Their claim to fame is their ribs and I've had their ribs once and wasn't really impressed. Maybe for a chain located in Podunk USA they might be fantastic but since Charlotte has various other rib places, this isn't worth it.  

The sandwiches I've had from here have been dry and bland.  The service is often inconsistent.  If you sit in the bar area, you have better luck.

Maybe this place is good for someone staying in the hotel next door but for the locals you can do better."}
{"text":"Came here for their prime rib special for $9.99. I have to say for $10, it was not that bad. It was well made, and what you could expect for $10. The prime rib we ordered was medium rare and it came out just like we asked. 
If you looking for a basic meal, this is definitely what you will get, that's why I'm giving it a 4 star review. Don't expect anything fancy, basically a simple dinner. 

Service was good, it was super busy due to the prime rib deal. But we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. They messed up our one drink order but it was fixed really quickly. 

Would come back here for their specials if I am ever back in Vegas."}
{"text":"we had a great time. it was full at 9pm on a Tuesday but we got in quickly and it was pleasantly cozy despite all the people. our waitress was wonderful. the food was good and just enough. the prices are quite reasonable. if you want a good meal for a good price stop in here."}
{"text":"Great steak for the price. We were down at Fremont and Tony Roma's had a special on steak. It was like $9 and was great for the price."}
{"text":"This is my third or perhaps fourth Tony Roma's restaurants that I have been to around the world. It was way less crowded than the Bangkok location. Lighting seems brighter than the one in Fremont, CA, and I can't recall at all the location(s) of the other chain outposts I have been to.

The menu still have some of the regular old school items, but it has definitely been revamped in the last 6-8 years since I ate at a Tony Roma's. The Steak & Wild Mushroom Flatbread in the appetizer section and the Basil Pesto Mahi Mahi & Vegetable Linguine in the pasta section both look really good, which I have to try next time.

But here's my review on what I ordered for dinner on this visit:

I was craving the Original Back Ribs with the TR's Original BBQ Sauce, which came with cole slaw and I opted for the loaded mashed potato as the other side item.  It came out of the kitchen before I could finished reading a page out of a book I brought with me.  Was told it was because they were slow.  So who knows how long it has been waiting in the kitchen to be served.  The full slab of ribs looks kind of small, it didn't even cover the length of the oval plate, and I knew I would have to order more food.  The flavor was good, but the ribs didn't match my fond memories of it.  Ellis Island's ribs is definitely the way to go for me while I am in Vegas.  (ribs 2.5-3 stars)

Ordered a Chopped Wedge Salad after the ribs arrived, and as simple as it was, it was a highlight of the dining experience (the rice pilaf was the other - crazy! I know).  (4 stars!)

From the Seafood section I ordered the Norwegian Salmon Pan Seared with Sesame Crust and finished with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. It was served with great rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  The fish was prepared well, but it would have been better if it was not cooked all the way through.  (3 stars) The best part of this item is your ability to customize your salmon or mahi mahi and the cooking method and finishing options.

Service was friendly, and attentive.  There were only 3 tables my waiter was responsible for, and only 2 at the most were in the restaurant at the same time, so it wasn't hard to check up on the guests and bring refills.

They also have a full bar, but I didn't order anything interesting from them.

Ambiance/Decor: 3/5  Had some pictures and such as wall decoration, the lighting at the booth were fairly bright which I like for taking food pictures, and music playing in the background.  Nice feel but nothing special.

Service:  4/5  Pleasant.

Food:  3/5  Portion is noticeably smaller with the ribs, flavor still the same, but the salad was refreshing and tasty.

Price:  3/5  Comparable to other casual dining competitions, and has options that will meet the needs of those on a modest budget (under $15/person) and others that can slightly splurge a little more.

During lunch they have the 7 for $7 promotion, and their happy hours are from 3pm to 7pm and also from 9pm to close.

Location:  West.  Not at all close to the Strip, so it is for locals.

Parking:  Plenty to select from, as it is in a large strip mall complex with several large national retailers such as Best Buy.

3 stars!  But the ribs will no longer be the reason for my future visits."}
{"text":"I guess I see the point when people treat Tony Roma's as something like an \"awww\", and then feel something like \"ewww\" because of the irrationally elevated expectations.

That's not fair, though - TR is a solid franchise, well built, professional grade. Pricey, but not really that expensive. Good menu, decent food, okay drinks.

The one and only reason to check out TR specifically would have been their beef ribs - few other chains are offering them. And those ribs are actually quite good, though personally I feel more like pork ribs.

Ambient is a very chain like, rather upscalish, but nothing specifically wrong with it. Cozy booths, clean, quiet, soft and comfortable atmosphere.

Been there with my wife, experience was fair and plain. Could be there again, or can skip the place all together - pretty much the same, if not for the beef ribs. Those are unusual and good, worth returning at least once."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have been happy every time. For those who think you are going to get a five star quality steak and lobster dinner for 17 dollars you are foolish. For what you pay here it is a great dinner. The servers are hard working people who have a tough job because they have many tables. If you don't like your 12 dollar steak go across the street to Vic and snthonys  and pay 50 just for the meat it is excellent but remember you wanted a 12 dollar steak dinner"}
{"text":"Only had the appetizer platter and the onion load was tasteless, the spinach and artichoke dip was runny and the boneless wings were chicken nuggets with hot sauce on them.  Wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Save your money. We took my father in law here for a birthday dinner while on vacation. The service was mediocre and the food was overpriced. My ribs were fine but the steaks were soggy. Pretty sure the only way that can happen is if you're eating frozen beef. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas. Next time we will be trying someplace else."}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas for a few days, I was happy to see Tony Roma's close to our hotel, since the one by our house has been closed for a few years now.

The hostess greeted us when we came in, and seated us at a nice booth.  The server, John, was very attentive and got our drinks out quickly.  The manager even came out and chatted with us briefly.  Another server offered us \"Rib Bibs\" which I accepted with no hesitation, to my husband's amusement.

We started with the onion loaf, which has gotten smaller over the years, but is still tasty, served with their signature barbecue sauce.

I ordered the St Louis ribs and was able to get corn on the cob instead of the coleslaw.  My side dish was the loaded mashed potatoes.  I don't care for my mashed potatoes with the skin left on, but that seems to be how it's done at Tony Roma's (Belatedly, I seem to remember the Orlando location did the same thing).  John brought me a dish of Carolina Honey sauce on my request.

My husband ordered the baby back ribs with the Maker's Mark Bourbon barbecue sauce.  He liked the sauce, but it was a little spicy for my taste.

We ordered  the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Sandwich for dessert.  Hubby asked for it to be split in the kitchen so we wouldn't have to lean over the middle of the table to share.  John took the initiative and had it made open-face (Single cookie topped with ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream) so we each had a nice little dessert rather than a (possibly) butchered ice cream sandwich.  I love the way he thought outside the box to take care of us!

I found an online coupon for a free appetizer, but couldn't get the link to open on my phone.  When I explained my dilemma to John, he asked the manager to give us the discount anyway.

We had a very pleasant meal with good food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Seating is a bit cramped,  I wonder what the fire department would have to say about that?  The shrimp scampi pasta was so watery, because the pasta was not drained before they put the sauce in.  Doing so completely killed the taste!  Complained to the waitress who didn't know jack about anything.  Out comes a man, possibly the manager, who asks if everything is okay?  We tell him that the pasta is too watery and that they did not drain the pasta before putting the sauce in.  He offers us a new batch, but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.  Rather than not charging us for the watery meal, he just walks away!"}
