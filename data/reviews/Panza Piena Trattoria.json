{"text":"looking for a quick indian fix? this is the place. they have great combos. $4.99 + tax for 2 vegetables and rice. $5.99 + tax a full thali. great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Okay, looking at the other reviews, it looks like they reviewed the wrong place. This is an Italian, not Indian, lunch spot.   Super friendly, family-run business. If you are allergic to dairy, you can have only one thing: the veal and rapini sandwich. The bread was nice and chewy and the veal was good. My coworkers had the breaded veal sandwich and the lasagna. Both said they were excellent.  The place offers hand-made pasta, made every morning (with milk). I plan to make a repeat visit and just allow myself to have an uncomfortable afternoon just to try it.  This is essentially a takeout/hot table place, but there's plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This 3 month old restaurant was opened in a tired and worn out location, and already looks seedy. It features lunch and dinner vegetarian buffet, accompanied by a large selection of pastries at extra prices.  The service was poor, as only 1 person was there to attend to everything. I was largely through half my meal before I got any nan. But at that point I inexplicably got 2 orders of nan, one of them with garlic. I had specifically ordered on plain nan, and when I mentioned that I was greeted with a strange quizzical look. I did not pursue the matter.  The offering were soggy, not very tasty and generally made for a very forgettable meal. This is one place where my feet will do the voting by never sullying their threshold again. It was cheap, but looked, tasted and felt cheap."}
