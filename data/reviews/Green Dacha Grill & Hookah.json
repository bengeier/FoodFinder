{"text":"Green Dacha was my favorite restaurant the first 7 times I ordered from them.  The food is amazing, everyone was helpful, and then I don't know what happened.  I tried to order something very simple (Hummus w/Ground Beef) and 2.5 hrs later my food didn't come.  Then they tell me they are closing and can't deliver my food now but they are sorry and I can call back and speak with Alexander and get a discount.   Then I call back and the owner is someone else, Julia, and they don't know what I'm talking about.  So all in all I'd say I'm never coming back here again but it was good while it lasted, kinda like a relationship in your 20s - Anthony"}
{"text":"I ordered through Eat 24, spent over $60.  We ordered Hummus w/ Meat, Carne Asada Fries, Chicken Fingers, a Chicken Burrito, piece of Kiss Cake and piece of Russian Cake.  It took 90 minutes, the food was ALL cold and flavorless, what little we ate of it.  They didn't send any bread with the hummus and the driver said the kitchen was closed and there was nothing he could do to help, so we didnt' open the hummus immediately.  Well, when we did open the hummus, it was ROTTEN.  The meat had mold growing on it, it smelled rotten, it made my nephew vomit from the smell of it.  I wouldn't let anyone eat another bite of the prepared food for fear of food posioning.  I did think it would be safe to try the cakes, but the Kiss cake was freezer burned, so I didn't even try the other cake.  I contacted Eat24 and sent them the photos of the hummus and we were given a full refund.  Its just shameful to send something out that you know is rotten....the smell alone was so strong that there is no way they didn't know it was bad."}
{"text":"It's wonderful day when we came to this shop.
We ate the pork chop,grill chicken and the deep fried chicken.
All the food are very delicious.
They have homemade fruit punch.
It's very special.
The waiter is very nice.
We will go there every time when we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh, meh and meh... I really had hope for this place but it started evaporating as soon as I saw signs on their door: \"18+ only\" and \"No weapons allowed\". Was that a joke or they really are having issue with minors shooting guns there?

After looking at the menu that was listing Russian, American,Mediterranean and... Mexican food I had a feeling that they are really struggling with their culinary \"identity\". Russian food choices were pretty standard (borsch, pelmeni and vareniki) but after some hesitation I've ended up ordering chicken lula kebab. Unfortunately that was an utter greasy disappointment that I could barely eat. Everyone seems to be raving about their potatoes which I found to be absolutely nothing special too. 

Decor looks like the place came out of 90s time machine. 

I really think most of the 5* reviews are either fake or produced by employees and their relatives. 

I still think that the place has a potential and if they want to attract more (American) customers (read - not just sketchy looking middle eastern men smoking hookah) they can easily do it by:
* simplifying the menu to just have Russian and Mediterranean food.
* change the decor... it's just a complete disaster right now
If that doesn't happen this Dacha will end up bankrupt before we know it... you can sustain business on just vodka drinking parties. It was a lunch time on the weekend and we were almost the only customers.

Otherwise if you want to have a decent kabob head out to Kabob House for now (heck... at least they don't charge any extra for the salad and their meat is done right)

Verdict: Not coming back unless I get paid to eat there.

PS. Kids are not welcome there either. They didn't even have a high chair available :/"}
{"text":"We had amazing food and incredibly attentive service here at the green Datcha. The perojki and vareniki were delicious. My wife speaks Russian and lived there for two years, and said this was some of the best Russian food she's had since being there. Thank you Green Datcha for a great night!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food!  I had the olivier salad, red borscht, chicken kiev, and napoleon cake.   The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that I wasn't really a fan of the kiev.  The kiev reminded me of fried chicken and was a bit dry and lacking in flavor in my opinion.  But everything else was really good.  I would like to go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I found this place on a fluke, and so glad I did!!! I usually order the Vareniki, so much flavor yet so simple, the reason I keep ordering from here. I usually also get the Khachapori, but tonight it wasn't on the menu so I tried their borscht, holy cow that was awesome. I love this place when I'm in the mood for comfort food."}
{"text":"Extremely helpful and very nice staff! We were trying to kill time until our flight time and it was time well spent! New place with a pleasurable environment! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Good Russian restaurant. Guess the only restaurant in whole Vegas where you can taste real national recipes and explore a little about Russian traditions and music. Very friendly stuff and affordable prices. Check out the beef stroganoff you'll definitely like it"}
{"text":"Never personally sat down &  tried the hooka thing, but their food is flamingly fantastic. I found this place by accident one night. I'm disabled and I do a lot of ordering out. But this place is open til 2am, the  chicken kabob is heavenly good. They include spiced potato wedged, which are BETTER than chili fries or anything else you can do with potatoes (which I'm not usually a fan of. 
 Best of all, I live 800 yrds from my apt complex, so it comes REALLY fast, the foods so fresh and hot it burns the delivery dude's hands! I order from them so much, they know me by name now! LOL"}
{"text":"It was our first time to this restaurant and the food and service were great. The things we didn't understand the server explained to us in a very friendly way. He was very nice and helpful. The food was very good as well, I had the beef stroganoff and loved it. My companions had the schnitzel, tried it and perfectly cooked. Definitely will visit this location again."}
{"text":"Lunch at the Green Dacha Restaurant was a delightful experience. The atmosphere, first off, was very relaxing... a combination of Russian & Middle Eastern. Our waiter, Alex, came over right away & asked us if we wanted drinks. The drinks came quickly & we enjoyed them while Alex explained the Russian menu. Their menu was very unique in that there were pictures of the dishes & explanations of what the dishes were underneath. We had appetizers first. The beef Pirojki, the Khachapuri & the Vinegret Beet Salad. Everything was fresh & delicious. The pastries were light & fluffy & they tasted just like homemade. The Dacha Beef Stoganoff was absolutely fantastic...mushrooms, onions, potatoes & garlic...just like Russia!
On a scale of 1-10, Green Dacha gets a 12++ on all counts...atmosphere, service & food. Go there & have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"The best hookah lounge in Las Vegas! Very comfortable atmosphere and outstanding service. Also, the food is delicious, everything fresh and home made Russian food. Come on karaoke night for a great time!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food, great performance and experience. If we are ever in town again from LA we would definitely come by again!"}
{"text":"The pelmeni is phenomenal.. the hummus is phenomenal... The greek salad is phenomenal. 

It's basically phenomenal. 

And we had great service."}
{"text":"Awesome place, with great food. It has different cuisines, which can satisfy probably anyone. The staff is very nice and welcoming. And the presence of hookah, the best I tried in Las Vegas for only 13$, makes the place perfect. Highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery here a few times but tonight was the worst, I was at work (I work graveyard) and was hungry, no other restaurants was open at the time that would be able to deliver so I chose to order from here. I ordered the pelmeni & a bowl of their special soup of the day (I got some sort of beet soup). All was good until 30 mins after I started feeling ill & started vomiting....I really wanted to like this place after all the good reviews but unfortunately after what happened to me tonight I don't think I'll ever order from here again :/"}
{"text":"Went to Green dacha with my boyfriend. Loved the atmosphere and nice smell of hookah. Food was delicious. I had pelmeni and my boyfriend had schnitzel. Portions were huge and prices very good. Also loved our server Anna. Way to go green dacha!"}
{"text":"We came to try something new and Green Dacha did not disappoint. The Khinkali was amazing, as well as the Beef Stroganoff. Our server was extremely helpful and informative. We will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Green Dacha is pretty legit. Delivery from grubhub. $8 from GH was a little steep (from Trop/15 to Rancho/Oakey) but everything was very good, and leftovers were just as good. 

Got some beef stroganoff, cabbage and beef pirojki (bit of a false cognate with pierogi; these are more like phyllo pastry turnovers), stuffed cabbage (prefer the ones I make at home, but that's more a style thing than a quality one -- these were good), and vareniki (which is an order of pierogies).

Definitely recommended as a change-up from the usual pizza/wings/thai/chinese takeout selection. Just as stick-to-your-ribs though.

Have not eaten in, so can't comment on the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Had the burrito, chicken fingers, nachos, and asada fries. Food was utterly terrible, but the service was okay."}
{"text":"One of the best go to places in Vegas, hands down. Great food, music, hookah. & the BEST hospitality!!
Good vibe here for sure"}
{"text":"What the heck!? These people must be writing their own reviews! This place was absolutely gross. I felt really dirty after I step foot in here. The menus are picture books with paper pages where the corners are all gross (looks like years of people licking their fingers and turning the pages)! DISGUSTING! I don't think they have replaced the menus in years! Then the tables are uncomfortable. The cloth on the tables are soooo long they get caught in everything. Then the lady who was supposed to serve us had a cordless house phone in her hand as she tried to wait on us..then as soon as she asked us what we may want to drink, the phone rang and she told us to hold on!!!! Then she proceeded to take this phone order while standing right by our table!!! The picture on the yelp reviews are shockingly different! The place was dingy and yellow in color, the place is small and there was only 3 tables full...and the largest of which looked like the family of this restaurants owners. We went last night on a Saturday night which should've been a busy and exciting night. This was a disgusting joke! After this lady rudely put us on hold, we decided that was not how we wanted to spend our weekend night out!!! This place is again absolutely DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"This place use to be so good but today it was disgusting. I will never eat here again I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"order a greek salad awful looking plate  presentation: tatsless lettcues, slimy,waterly,  not crispy and fresh.  fetea cheese large big square cut vegetables also unbelievably big square cuts. i enjoy eating a greek salad. but this will be my first an last t i m e!!!!  ordering a greek salad from this restaurant.  i may order from
here but i know what not to order!!!  dump out quickly. my. order was over $27.00plus tip.  \"no sweet deal here\".  the chips an cheese dip very good tasting. chips perfectly fried. salsa  taste good.  i didn't recheck my order before placing it 
and paid for two extra side order of feta cheese at a cost over $3.00 dollars each. \"dump out\"
no sweet n deal here!!!!

it's 4:30a.m. and i can't sleep i'm hungary"}
{"text":"The edamame was covered in some sort of sweet sticky sauce. Not sure what the point is to order a healthy appetizer if they are going to serve it covered in syrup. Beef kabob was so rare it bled all over my plate and turned my yogurt pink but was still very tough. Overall it's nice that they deliver but that may be the only way they can give this stuff away."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious both times we ordered. My go too for special occasions. Will not disappoint. Chicken Kiev was amazing However missing from menu. Bring it back! Outstanding. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yum!! Excited for a Russian spot in LV! amazing food and great atmosphere- can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"So Finally we have a great Russian restaurant in Las Vegas! Food is delicious, atmosphere is relaxing and stuff is so friendly. Menu is inexpensive! Thank you guys!! We will be right back soon"}
{"text":"The three stars is only for the lovely server I had . She was amazing and tried to make my night , she even sang karaoke in an english song ( she made my day ) .The problem was I attempte to order a beverage off the menu. The first drink I ordered they did not have as we'll as the second and third drink . Therefore, I finally just ordered a beer which was amazing ! Although this is discouraging to customers who order a drink then being told they do not have it 3 times"}
{"text":"I absolutely just fell in love with this place!!! The food is amazing, you can tell that they take the time to taste their food before it's served. I ordered delivery and it was here in a timely manner...super kudos, I just found my new favorite place to have delivered...awesome work!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. We had awesome service! I wasn't sure of what to order from the Russian menu, however that wasn't a problem the waiter walked me through what was best. We ordered the humus and Russian dumplings, both did not disappoint. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Alex was such a gracious host, I needed a place to work on my laptop AWAY from the house (remote workers can sympathize) so I usually look for hookah lounges to work at. Today is my first full day living in LV so I researched this spot and called in to make sure they offered wifi (which they do). I ended up having a delicious kebab platter followed by a green tea w/ mint, lemon and honey. All while being accompanied by a double apple hookah, so good. I was able to get most* of my work done (which for me is an accomplishment) and will become a frequent at this spot for many more days to come. Thanks Alex, look forward to having our salsa socials at your venue!!!"}
{"text":"Things have changed from my previous visit- and not in a good way. The décor and atmosphere are (still) offputting, service (remains) dismal, and management was unprofessional, but we remembered the food was good... Well, not any more.

Came in late at night, again to blasting music and flashing lights. It's telling that every single one of their customers opted to sit outside on the patio. I noticed that the regulars weren't ordering any food. Menu has added American and Mexican food options like burgers, nachos, and burritos. I understand that they're trying to pull in more business, but it brings to mind the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" phrase.

We ordered four dishes: cabbage pirozky, vinaigrette, julien, and the Olivier we fondly remembered from last time. The pirozky were the only item that were okay, and they were not made in house. The vinaigrette tasted like a basic salad of pickled vegetables. There was minimal beet in a dish that is supposed to be beet-based. The julien looked like a soup in the menu photo but what we received was like a personal pizza, topped with mozzarella and mushrooms. It's hard to find those flavors unappealing, but that is NOT julien. They apparently cannot make the dishes on their menu.
As for the Olivier? It was flat-out disgusting. It looked congealed, as if it had been sitting out, exposed to air, for hours. Flavor was completely off and just bad. We took one bite, and immediately asked for the bill.

As for the service? Our server was a very sweet lady. But she knows nothing about Russian food. We voiced our concerns and she reported back to the kitchen and owner, but no one ever came out to speak with us. Our basic order took 40 minutes, and we were the only table ordering and most of the dishes were premade. To top it off, a group of regulars brought in a blow up doll in with them. Classy vibe here, clearly."}
{"text":"I was hungry late at night and usually i don't eat out after 11 pm but i decided to check this place they had me for the 5$ off when u check in and i must say it's a really nice place feels good the vibe is nice service was really good i felt at home and i must tell the truth i only tried one dish but this dish made my night!!! Really good food definitely going to come back to check more of the Russian menu!! Loved it"}
{"text":"My group was looking for a Russian restaurant in Vegas and this place popped up with good reviews. Made a reservation for 12 people and when we showed up we were literally the only people there. At that point we were def a little hesitant cause why would a restaurant in Vegas with good reviews be empty at 8:30 pm??

Food was amazing!!! We got a bunch of apps and tons of entrees and shared them all. I don't rembmber any names but literally everyone liked every dish which is hard to do in my group. Try this place out if you in Vegas and wanna try good Russian food off the strip"}
{"text":"I was the only person having lunch and it was terrible. I assume they make their money in the evenings with the hookah crowd."}
{"text":"You have to be kidding with this place.  This is a Bulgarian-run operation with a bunch of people who have absolutely no clue of how to run a pleasing and appealing restaurant in this city or this hemisphere for that matter!

When we walked in there were few people there so we asked for one table in particular but we were told if just became RESERVED so instead we had to sit in a both where one side was about 6 inches higher than the other and the other side had no seat backs, rather a bench type seat.  Interestingly enough, the \"RESERVED\" table that we asked for was still unoccupied upon our departure.

Inexplicably, the rave reviews on Yelp were what convinced us to try to this place.  Many reviews praised the Chicken Kiev, which was quite unfortunate because we were told that they were OUT OF 'CHICKEN FRIGGING KIEV!  

The waiter, nice enough really was in over his head.  There were two different types of potatoes (plus rice) available with the entrees and he TRIED to explain to us that they were both the same dish now because at one time there WERE two different types of potatoes but they eliminated one of the two options but NEVER changed the menus to reflect that.  You can have potatoes or potatoes! Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!

He told us the Greek Salad ($9.95) was more than big enough for four people.  Wrong!   It was barely enough for two people.  He brought it out with a serving spoon on other utensil to distribute its small portions.  I guess they use their hands in Bulgaria.

The music in there was quite loud and we asked if  they could turn it down a bit.  The waiter said probably not because they were going to have a party soon and that was the desired volume.  Only later when we escalated the issue to the owner did they turn it down a little bit.

I ordered Chicken Kabob, with the now unitary potato choice.  My wife too.  The \"kabob\" on a skewer concept was sadly eviscerated here, replaced instead with an open slab of chicken with lots of chunks of heavy duty, 30-weight potatoes to fill out the plate.   Carb city!  I asked the owner what happened to the skewer and the expected veggies on it?  He said this is a \"different kind\" of Kabob.  Get over it!

My friend asked for some gravy or something equivalent to put on his pork dish.  He was expecting something warm but instead was given a bowl of what looked like ketchup and nice and cold to boot.  That is Bulgarian gravy!  

I must say that the food tasted OK, but there was nothing great or memorable about it..  It was like something your neighbor made and invited you over for..  Eh?  OK, and that's about it.

The Russian beer they served was quite good.  Total tab for this food-fest - a paltry $115.60!

I really don't understand all the great review here - I REALLY don't!   ...and really it is not to be considered a \"Mediterranean\" restaurant, in spite of the Greek Salad.

Only the good beer saved this place from one star.  Uh, no, one star it is!

Sorry guys, but NO."}
{"text":"First time here & the service was great along with the atmosphere. Definitely will be back again. Thanks Mikael"}
{"text":"I came here for my dance competition, it was supposed to start at 12:00 but they kept delaying it and eventually his dance competition was at 12:45! So I literally got out of work EARLY to get here and they check ID, but entrance is free so that's the good part. 18 to get in 21 to drink. Basically I came early and they had some other people singing or MC-Ing and omg I'm sorry but they suck so bad I was about to leave because the talent was soooo bad these guys here are like literally rapping and singing whatever but it was so bad I'm sorry and I was waiting so long for my friend to dance! And they just kept pushing him back farther and farther until 12:45 and I had to stay here and listen to this terrible talent omg so I sat outside until my friend was up and eventually he did preform and I think that was probably the most epic part that whole night I mean the crowd was actually getting up and getting hyped because this dance battle was so epic. Anyways they do sell drinks here and I haven't tried their food, the place is kinda small kinda hard to dance in oh but they do sell hookah ! So if you like hookah by all means entry is free but the talent sucked sorry guys"}
{"text":"Went there Sunday night  -after reading some reviews. Wow were we wrong !! Slow , inattentive service, hookah went unattended even after we asked for more coals. Asked for a drink , which I never received. When we politely told our server what our issues were, she didn't even really seem phased. It's a shame as it had great ambience and had potential as a great place to chill with friends for drinks and hookah, food is not even an option at this point. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place had potential but we were not impressed. It was pretty much empty when we entered and this is never a good sign, but we were willing to forgive that if the food was good. It wasn't.... They had Mexican food, international food, russian food and one other type of cuisine - hardly any russian food, which was weird considering they are a russian restaurant."}
{"text":"I know food. This place has the best chicken kabobs ever! Plus the garlic sauce is so good and addicting. After finding out about this place, I have to go once a week."}
{"text":"We bought a Amazon Local certificate after reading the reviews and were looking forward to dining here.  We went after Church on Sunday and arrived around 1:00 pm.  You would expect the restaurant to be busy at that time, but as we were parking we were in doubt that they were open as the lot was empty.  We parked and went in to find the place empty except for one person (owner/employee ?) and they were sitting at a table ASLEEP.......... We turned around and left, as we were leaving saw this person (a man) look out the door as we must have woke him.
The place was very dingy and dark and very un-inviting.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that all the 5 stars are trumped up.  I wouldn't go back if it was free.
Called Amazon Local and told them what happened, they were very much in agreement with me about the situation and gladly refunded my purchase.
I would like to say everyone has an off day and maybe this was theirs??"}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and have no gone to the restaurant yet. The food was delicious. My boyfriend had the Chicken Kebab and I had the Beef Kebab. We also had the hummus.  The portions were adequate if not large, but that is all on the person eating, I believe. It was good food, but we also spent $50 on it which I thought was a little high. I'm sure the 9$ delivery fee from GrubHub was more the culprit. Nonetheless, I'd recommend eating there."}
{"text":"Hookah was good. Atmosphere was fun but the service is HORRIBLE! We saw our server maybe 2 times at best. That was to take our order, bring our drinks & hookah and then he disappeared. Had to  track him down to get our check. Don't know that I would come back due to the extremely poor service."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Have not been here since last September. It had excellent food and excellent people working there. I enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"Simply brilliant.

This is a little secret that should be guarded and only shared with your besties. 

Their potatoes were amazing."}
{"text":"Last time I orders from them I did not get a correct order after 2 hours. I ended up getting food from somewhere else. Good luck with them."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be amazing and was very excited to take my girlfriend here. I've seen Green Dacha online before but when i stumbled upon a Groupon for this place, i didn't hesitate. 
When we showed up the inside was absolutely empty with loud music and reeked of hookah smoke so we asked to sit outside. We were seated next to a group of Russian speaking people that as a typical eastern europeans are, were very loud and obnoxious. But thats fine, I am from Ukraine it I'm used to that type of behavior. But this was just bottom like offensive. These guys were on the porch, in front of us, behind us and literally stood right above our heads. They were talking and yelling so loud that i couldn't hear what my girlfriend was saying. All were chain smoking in our face. Some of them were drunk. And the curs words they were using i haven't heard in the past 11 years since i left Ukraine. Anyways that was only the beginning. Because of all this happening around us and now they were trying to engage in a conversation with us we decided to eat and get out as soon as possible. 
I asked our server for two waters. She came back with water and lemonade. I asked her to switch the lemonade for water. She came back with another lemonade. I asked the second time to switch it for water. Guess what?! She cam back with LEMONADE the third time. At that point i thought maybe she doesn't speak english so i said in Russian \"Do you guys not have water, why you keep bringing back lemonade\"?! To which she answered \"NO we don't\" then laughed and ran away. At that point i was sitting with my eyes wide open thinking WTF did just happened. 
Trying to get out of there i just order one of the most expensive things on the menu which is shrimp just to get our Groupon money worth it and my girlfriend got chicken with potatoes. They bring out 7 shrimp. I repeat 7 medium size shrimp in cold sauce for $20! no rice. no salad. just shrimp. Thats it. Ive never paid that much for so little. 
This place really needs someone to watch over it and make sure things don't get out of hand like it did that nigh. I feel like it just needs someone in charge. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my girlfriends chicken and potatoes was pretty good which we both ended up eating."}
{"text":"Interesting place, delicious food, nice personnel, cozy atmosphere. Makes me want to come back for more :)"}
{"text":"They serve mouth watering Russian food with a touch of Mediterranean dishes- must try- unique style,  taste, and environment. They also have hookahs with yummy flavors!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on Friday October 2nd. Th service, food, atmosphere and everything is absolutely horrible. Our waitress was number one way to close to us leaning on our chairs and tables. When she wrote down our order she put her notepad on the table and wrote it that way. Have you ever been a server in your life? No one does that. No one. We asked for two waters she brought out one water and one lemonade. We thought she misheard us so we asked again. She brought the same cup with the same lemonade. Finally we thought maybe she doesn't understand English so we spoke in Russian and asked her for water NOT lemonade and the stupid girl brought lemonade again. So I asked her does she mr understand or what is going on? I said do
You not have water. Tap water? She said no in Russian and walked away. What a horrible start. Then we paid for a $20 shrimp platter with 7 pieces of shrimp and sauce that tasted like crap. Such a poor experience! How do you run out of water? How do you not understand English OR RUSSIAN when I ask for water? Here's a tip. Have water for a restaurant do not ever tell a guest you run out of water. Water is free unless it's bottled. Did your water dispenser break? If so have the professional to explain why your bringing out lemonade when we didn't ask for it. Do no lean on chairs and tables and be so close to me that I feel you breathing. That's disgusting, understand body space. Do no put your notepad on the table so I can see you writing. Servers NEVER do that. I don't even know how to explain last night but it was just comedy on how bad it was. Never ever eating or recommending this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and one of the best hookahs I have ever had!! Definitely a must try if you're in Vegas and looking for a chilled out place to hang out."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's new job! I love Eastern European food and this hit the spot! I had the beer stroganoff and my boyfriend had the garlic shrimp. We also had the hummus with ground beef and it was delicious! Definitely a must try when you come here. Just a heads up, the restaurant has a very relaxed European feel. The service does take a little longer than most but the food is worth the wait! Plus, the waiters are really nice and check in to make sure everything's ok. We'll be back with friends next time!"}
{"text":"The server was nice. She doesn't speak English very well though. Spoke too soft for the loud music playing. 

The food was good. I got hummus with ground beef. And my friend got beef kabob with a side salad for me. The unique garlic sauce that the beef kabob came with was so good! The potatoes were good too. The side salad was awful though. I don't know what kind of dressing it was. 

Complaints: The waitress took 20 minutes to come give us the bill after we were finished and we were the only table there. she was too busy talking with her friends and showing each other stuff on their phones. She said she would honor the $5 off check in on Yelp and grabbed my phone to do it. we got the bill and she didn't take $5 off. Also she didn't refill our waters. 

I love Mediterranean food. I won't be coming back here though."}
{"text":"I come from NY and grew up on Russian food. After moving to Vegas four years ago, I was very disappointed with Vegas' lack of East Euro food. 

When I heard about Dacha I was excited and went there to eat. The service was good, very clean inside and even the music was enjoyable.

The reason for the two star rating is because of what happened with the food. The food itself, Russian stew and Russian salad, was very enjoyable. I pretty much ate it all. However, about two hours later I started getting sick and by nighttime I was vomiting for hours. 

I'm used to eating this food from the family and I have a strong stomach (have not vomited in 12 years until now). Not sure what rubbed me the wrong way, possibly a spice was used that I'm not familiar with. Not sure what it was, but certainly not running to eat there again."}
{"text":"The place overall is not bad. Service was great which you usually don't see in Eastern European places. The restaurant really has identity crisis though (serves Russian, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, and even has edamame on the menu and Spanish matedor pictures on the wall). Based on decor, name, and staff, they gear towards Russian customers but have very limited Russian menu. We mostly ordered Russian food. It was good but not great with meat in pelmeni a little chewy and not as tender I like. I could go on but all else would be gravy...which likely could be found on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is totally good! We randomly choose this place using the Eat24 delivery app. They were on time the food hot and really delicious. Perfect !!!"}
{"text":"had never tried authentic Russian food, so this was a fun experience.  The reason I am not giving it higher stars is that some of the food was great, and some was not.  The desserts, not so great.  The music was so loud could not understand the waitress and had to shout at her to place our order.  Plus we could not converse. So the atmosphere left us kind of cold.  It was not comfortable and inviting. I guess if you're going to drink and hang out it's okay but not for dinner.  The owner is nice."}
{"text":"This place is great. You do have to know what is good to order and this is why I am here. Beef Kabobs, some of the best I have ever eaten. (they come medium-medium rare), so if you don't like, order a different temperature).  Chicken Kabobs, excellent. Chicken Schnitzel, outstanding. Potatoes, great. Pork Steak, very good, but not a very good value. Stroke'in'off, very good, but I am no expert, (on the dish anyway). Service, excellent. Putin really beat them into shape. Decor, 80's/90's, this is where it is stuck and this is where it should be, excellent. 

A couple of gripes. Rice..on my most recent order they had transitioned from some of the most outstanding wet long-grained rice with butter and green onions to a super dry jasmine with just green onions. Please switch back! It was seriously the best rice I had ever eaten. Delivery, although they know it is a cash pay, guy shows up with three $20 bills as all of the change he carried. Fortunately I rounded up some ones to cover the $24 bill. He was very gracious and apologetic and offered to just take $20 for the bill. Glad I was able to scrounge up some bills to pay the full amount. 

I will keep ordering from here and hopefully they keep improving. They have 5 star potential."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. Good prices and good food. The feta fries were delicious. Good service, clean bathrooms. The chairs/sofas are clean and comfortable. Fun date spot to just hang out and chill."}
{"text":"I sincerely wish I could go lower than one star, this place should be shut down immediately. I ordered shrimp and garlic sauce and a kiss cake. If you look online the picture makes it look Like a 5 Star delicious meal.. WRONG you will get 10-15 shell shrimp barley cooked. The driver comes up says sorry sir they tried calling (LIE) they where out if kiss cake so they gave me something else. So thinking to myself don't knock it before you try it I proceed to eat a few shrimp mistake #1 for me I immediately regret it call the restaurant and ask for my money back. 10 min go by I start throwing up in a bag in my room .. Guarantee food poisoning if you eat here. VEGAS SHUT THEM DOWN!"}
{"text":"Ok folks, Green Dacha was a really fun and delicious  experience for me. Especially if you like good authentic Russian, Eastern-European kitchen like I do. Great warm environment with excellent customer service kind of place. Live entertainment happens couple times a week, karaoke nights are super fun, and also, if you are a hookah lover, this place is for you. The owner is a young progressive energetic individual, so is his place!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Russian food and to be honest I was very under-impressed! We went around 7pm on a Friday night, but the place was a ghost town. Told us that the normal crowd comes in later, for hookah etc. The server was pleasant, but everything took a long time to come out. Considering there was only one other couple there besides us at the time, this should not have been the case. I really thought I would never try Russian again. My husband kept telling me that there are much better Russian food places out there and we definitely found it at Cafe Mayakovsky! They are on the other side of the strip (East side), on Tropicana by McLeod. Where the old Liberachi museum used to be. That is awesome Russian!! Go check that place out. However, if you like a younger crowd and hookah and drinks, maybe Dacha is for you. If you want good food, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I saw all these great reviews so I decided to give this place a chance. As we walked in we greeted and seated. The bench seating is uncomfortable so I suggest you sit in a chair. The waiter was very attentive there was only 2 tables occupied in the whole restaurant so it was expected. 

The tables looks like they are from the 80's with the shiny black and white fake marble look. We felt like we were sitting in someone living room. 

We ordered the beef stroganoff which was ok a bit oily for our taste. We also ordered the vareniki with potatoes which was ok at best. The hit of the night was the chicken porharzky cutlets that was awesome. The rice was kind of bland and needs some help. The potatoes were really good. The orders took a long time to come out.

I don't think I would go back It's just not our style....sorry"}
{"text":"A schnitzel and salad took 45 minutes to come out. They were serving one other table, so I'm not sure why they said they were busy. Also, they're \"out\" of beef stroganoff, but I'm pretty sure that just meant they didn't feel like making it on a Sunday night. They didn't include napkins or silverware in the take out bag either, so now I have to go find some of those somewhere. Also, the guy gave resistance to honoring the yelp voucher they offered."}
{"text":"This is the third review I've left here, but this is the only one you'll see. The first one I left was bashing security, who treated me like a criminal as opposed to a customer, which I wrote in my first review, while I was still there. While still at the location, the manager walked up and asked me to change said review, which I did to placate him making it a now dishonest review to please him, so I didn't get kicked out with my friends. Going back to my first thought; the atmosphere was great, the waitstaff was friendly, the dj's were fantastic, but the prison mentality of the security ruined my whole experience, and poisoned my good time. I will not come here again. Bummer..."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here and I'm happy to say that the food is delish!  The chicken kabob is made just right...juicy & tender. Chicken Kiev is a Russian delicacy that not many restaurants serve, however,  it is made and served here!  The  portions are very generous and the service is friendly and fast.  Will be back for the entertainment."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food, hookah, drinks and especially the advice is hands down phenomenal! Everything was served fast and delicious! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Ok, so normally I like supporting Russian places, but I have no clue what happened to this place. Me and gf and my sister (visiting from CA), went to this place to eat. Last time I went it wasn't too bad. This is just embarrassing. Strange new menu, including Russian, Mexican, American, Greek? Ordered Oliviye, vinegret, piroshky and, Julien. Piroshky were edible but the rest was not Russian food. Oliviye is not warm potato salad from a jar. Vinegret is not supposed to be white..what? Did I miss something? So besides being embarrassed in front of my sister we had to leave and go eat somewhere else, because we couldn't take more than a few bites of anything. Sorry for being harsh but my review doesn't actually do this experience justice."}
{"text":"Wow, just awesome,  salad, piroki, and vaieniki for a light lunch and we are stuffed.  Great music."}
{"text":"Haven't tried their dishes yet. Ordered dessert through Eat24. Took awhile for two dishes but the Napoleon was delicious as was the kiss cake! Freshly made and soft. Fyi the kiss cake was from Manan bakery! I'll try them directly next time."}
{"text":"Amazing hookah, great food, and awesome service! This place is one of the best hookah joints I've been too. It has a nice atmosphere and is perfect for groups. The Russian beers are a must have and the hookah tastes great and is really smooth."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, wanting to try something new. The food was delicious! Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good hookah. Will definitely be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"This is a local Russian watering hole. House mixed hookah flavors were fantastic and the atmosphere is upbeat yet relaxed. I wish I could speak Russian to join the karaoke night! Authentic borscht made in house was delicious, I felt as though I was in Russia again:) I would recommend this to everyone! Although I rated $$ the alcohol and hookah ($13.95)are more than reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fantastic hookah, excellent food, great patio and service. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, its great!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, awesome food and atmosphere.  I would recommend coming here at anytime.  The food is traditional and well prepared."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant expecting Russian and Mediterranean fare so it came as a surprise to find the menu included both American and Mexican at the expense of several dishes we wanted to try.  Since we were the only customers on a Sunday evening, I would hazard a guess that the menu changes are an attempt to attract a wider customer base.  We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.  Unfortunately the entrees were less successfully with the beef being a little too tough and the chicken on the dry side."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was awful. We walk in and were ignored by 2 employees all while the restaurant was filled with one table. Yes, one table with a family of 6. If they can't even greet a customer when they have one table, I can't imagine what it's like when they're actually busy. 

The atmosphere was also extremely weird from the moment you walk in the door. It was 6pm on a weekday and they had the music bumping, lights down, and strobe/laser lights going. Didn't know if I was in a restaurant or club. I usually don't care too much about atmosphere as long as it's clean and service/food is good but this place just bothered me. It's also tucked away in a really ghetto shopping center where the Parking lot is filled with the local mini mart's sketchy shoppers. I honestly didn't feel safe and I've been to all kinds of places in not to so good parts of town. 

So, the food... It was descent. Wouldn't say it was exceptional. Honestly the service and atmosphere ruined the meal. The dumplings were bland and oily. The chicken schnitzel was okay and the potatoes were okay as well. 

Honestly, I won't be going back though I don't live far from here."}
{"text":"If there were more stars to give, I'd give them. 

Delivery takes less than an hour and all items arrive warm and ready to eat. 

Pricing is very reasonable given the excellent quality of the food. 

So far we've tried the Stroganoff, Schnitzel, Hummus with Ground Beef, Chicken Salad and Vareniki. Every single dish was AMAZING, perfectly prepared and full flavored, this is the best food I've had in Las Vegas so far. 

Can't say enough nice things about Green Dacha Grill and will definitely be a regular customer for a long time to come !"}
{"text":"Unfortunately people can't organize their business in a professional way. I spent 30 minutes to get here from other part of city and guess what? Even though the Yelp says it's open - it actually was closed. My time is really important for me. I wish they could manage their page better. Sorry, but it's 1 star..."}
{"text":"Just got some food to go from here..I orders chicken tenders...which I did not receive. I also ordered chicken kebob plate and asked if it came with pita bread and the server claimed that it comes with it, I didn't receive any. I asked for salad dressing on the side and it wasn't...salad was so soggy and drenched it was indelible.
The rice was soaked with oil on the chicken plate too...very disappointed bc it was my first and only meal of the day and it was terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through yelp on a whim. We got pelmeni, chicken tenders and Russian cake. It all tasted great and home cooked, but I feel like for the price there should be bigger portions. They took exactly an hour from me submitting my order but it was worth the wait. If I really get a hankering for Russian delivery food again I'll order."}
{"text":"I don't know how this plays got five stars, nice place, great atmosphere that's why they got the one star. The service was absolutely horrible I mean horrible. Only two tables in the whole place and the waitress was not to be seen we have to flag her downevery time we needed something and she forget we'd wait at least 20 minutes and that's after we told her the second time is when we got our drinks. I do not recommend this place nor will I ever return."}
{"text":"Get the lamb chops they were awesome! Can't go wrong with $12 hookah either and service was perfect. Will come back whenever I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night with a gf and the look of the place reminds me of a Dacha, therefor the name, the hookah was excellent and the food was delicious, the only work they probably need is a little better music to when it's a week day and it's empty."}
{"text":"Great food, good variety. The hummus with ground beef was amazing. Came here with a couple of friends and enjoyed some delicious hookah. Next time I come near Vegas I'm definitely coming back here. I personally had the stroganoff which was amazing, the asada fries were also great. Oh and ask to try the Kompot drink, it is very refreshing and just the right amount of sweet."}
{"text":"Easily the best Russian restaurant in town.  My wife is originally from Moscow and is quite persnickety when it comes to pelmeni and borscht!  The Green Dacha passed with flying colors!  The borscht was right up there with my mother in laws recipe!  I said right up there Olga, put down the bat! Pelmeni was great, potato salad was very tasty and beef stroganoff will make you lick the plate when no one is looking!  My favorite dish was the khachapuri...it could be its own food group!  Can't wait to go back and try the blini, drink more Baltikas and try the home made Napoleon!  Alex was our waiter and he was awesome!  If you're already a Russian gastronome or just want try this hearty fare The Green Dacha is definitely the place to go in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came with husband and toddler to try out restaurant. The first thing we noticed on the door was two signs, \"No one under 18,\" and \"No weapons allowed.\" I got concerned whether or not this was a restaurant and hookah bar, or just a hookah bar that would not allow the toddler in with us. Luckily, the waiter told us it was alright to come in with the child. While getting sat down, the waiter told us the restaurant did not have any booster or high chairs. We knew would have to hold the child while eating which would be uncomfortable, but were hungry and decided to stay. There was another table being served besides us.

I was seeking Mediteranian food and found this restaurant on yelp. The menu was a book with pictures that don't show the description that well. I ordered the steak skewer plate which came with potatoes, even thought the steak skewer in the picture on the menu looked burned. It was around an additional $2 to add salad to the steak skewer and potatoes. I didn't get the salad because usually other places include the salad with the dish. The plate was around $13. 

There was a Mexican section in the menu. The pictures of the Mexican food did not look Mexican. There was also a Russian and American section. 

The steak and potatoes tasted good. The cons were that I did not get full because the portions were not proportioned adequate. The plate presentation was plain.

The waiter was friendly, but I felt unwelcome in the environment due to other environmental factors, as well the restaurant not feeling family friendly.

The environment did not match. It's a open seating area that looks like a big cabin that has an industrial looking ceiling with a small chandelier in the center, with decoration that is from Spain and Middle East, with traditional and Tuscan furniture mixed up. 

I noticed that restaurant had a list of alcoholic drinks served on each table, probably for the hookah population. On the list, there was a drink called wet p****. It was definitely not kid friendly. Luckily our toddler cannot read or ask questions.

From reading the previous reviews written, I agree with the previous review written on March 8, 2015. If this place is going to be a hookah bar and restaurant, it needs some work. I question if the other reviews are authentic because they sound like they are promoting the place and all gave this place five stars, which misled me."}
{"text":"I had the red borscht and a cup of coffee, both were excellent.  Ive never had borscht before, but I plan to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I had my doubts of a combination Hookah lounge and restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised when we tried Green Dacha.  The food we had was awesome.  Everything from the Greek salad, the Baba Ganoush along with some favorites on the menu....and the french fries are the best I've had in town...very crunchy and crispy...I will definitely go back!  I also enjoyed the Russian red wines.  This is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and fairly priced. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about the dishes he recommended to us. 

The happy hour specials are also at convenient times for dinner, bringing the cost of booze down to better levels. Try the Baltika 6, it's a darn good beer!

The interior is spacious, but still feels cozy.  There are tables and chairs, as well as lounge seating if you want to relax.

All in all, a great experience. Would come again!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook! Service is excellent, they're open until 3 a.m., and the food is superb. This is a culinary gem!

Try the following:
drink - Kompot
appetizer - vareniki
main - Schnitzel"}
{"text":"My 5 stars go to the driver that came back with my money becouse my order was prepaid just want to say thank you one more time there is no much people in USA that would come back!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!!  Nice atmosphere, food was delicious, courteous and prompt server, all around great experience.  Gotta love it when you leave a place feeling totally relaxed."}
