{"text":"After a botched attempt at getting the entire family (11-12 people) together for Father's Day dinner I decided I would just take my parents and nephew out instead. We were originally going to hit up the Keg but with the rest of the family bailing I decided we would check out Jessica Restaurant again.   We have been here before my a past birthday of my mom's and I was really impressed by their food. I decided to give it a go again and see if it was first time luck or if the food is always like that.  We showed up around 6:30PM and the restaurant was packed, I figured as much being Father's Day today and all. However, we did find a table and the servers there are more than accommodating.  They quickly took our order which consisted of Chicken Fried Rice, Pineapple Sweet & Sour Pork, Salt & Pepper Squid and Beef mixed with Broccoli in an XO sauce.   I have to admit Jessica Restaurant probably has hands down the best Salt & Pepper Squid in the city as far as Chinese restaurants go. It's basically all squid, a light batter and not drenched in oil when you are munching on it  - I can't say the same for most Chinese restaurants that offer this dish.  The Pineapple Sweet & Sour Pork was delicious as well, perfectly made, perfect amount of sauce and the vegetables mixed in tasted fresh as well.  The Beef mixed with Broccoli n XO Sauce wasn't too bad, I think I have had better elsewhere but it wasn't so terrible that you couldn't eat it.  Lastly, the Chicken Fried Rice I thought was a little plain had to add pepper and hot sauce to make it taste better but then again most places the Fried Rice is usually whatever really."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Jessica's...  Dim Sum $3.25  that says it all YES.  Since after the chinese new year they began to serve DIM SUM YUM!  @ $3.25 you can't go wrong.    They have over 20+ items and they range from $3.25 and some dishes are more expensive.   Dim Sum  Mon - Fri  10am - 4pm.  I'm pretty Sat and Sun as well   They don't have a lot of options for Bubble Tea but it is a very generous portion.  Service is PERFECT. There is always someone available and your water & Tea is constantly filled!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret is their real food!    The Take Away Dinner for one is  a steal at $9.98 per person, because it caters to a western palate with Chinese Style.  The Chicken fried rice and  spring roll are the staples and  then you make two more choices,    It took a while for my husband to even try Jessica because there was a previous restaurant in the same location and he hated the food there. Now he's sold.    Also, my son and I went for dim sum, everything was hot, fresh and delicious.   The noodle wrapped chinese donut was our favourite.  And the Jasmine Tea lovely.  Word to the wise,  if you are expecting  pre-packaged Ginger Beef and  the Sweet and Sour chicken, you will be disappointed.   Jessica cooks Ginger Beef the way it should be served and it is tender and delicious.  The sweet and sour chicken actually has good fresh chicken and a light tangy sauce that tastes more like sauce than syrup.  From the samplings of the portions we have had,  they're enough to satsify.  I'm looking forward to trying some of their seafood dishes and more Dim Sum..  I'm so glad this jewel of a restaurant came to the NE!"}
{"text":"Now called the Ruby Queen.  In the same strip mall with No Frills.  The incorrect name in the listing threw us off for a bit, but after confirming the address and checking wit the staff, we were in the right place.  We ordered the wonton soup, chicken fried rice, beef with broccoli, and BBQ pork chop suey.  All was great.  Soup broth not too salty.  Bean sprout were cooked but still crisp. Tender beef strips and lots of fresh broccoli also cooked just right.  Rice had lots of veggies and cubed chicken.  Tea to wash all down.  There was enough for two and leftovers for lunch the next day for under $40!  Dining room was clean with booths and circular tables. Staff very friendly and service was quick.   Only bad thing was teapot was cracked and leaky when pouring.  I'd definitely go again to try the dim sum weekends for lunch!"}
{"text":"Was in the NE part of the city and decided to try Jessica Restaurant as we had seen an ad for the restaurant in the Chinese newspaper.  We ordered the Chinese Dinner (Say Wor Choy) i.e., soup, 4 dishes, rice and dessert.  Soup - Fish Maw and Crab Meat Soup - delicious and hot - top it up with a little red vinegar and white pepper  4 dishes consist of:  - House Special Open Range Chicken - poached just right with the most fragrant marinade;  it comes cold and you eat the chicken with the special ginger and green onion salty and oily dipping sauce - I love this dish!  If you are afraid of the chicken head, don't order this dish!  Just don't eat the head and you'll do fine! :o) - Salt and Pepper Fish - OMG!  The batter is so light and the fish is so fresh with no fishy smell at all. I like the way they make the garnish - chopped up green and red peppers with onions and fried garlic!  Need I say more?   - Pork Slices and Prawns with Snap Peas and Sugar Peas in a light sauce - so refreshing! - The best for last - Ginger and Green Onion Crab sitting on a bed of noodles with loads of gravy.  Piping hot crab - just dig in and go at it!  The noodles soaked up the gravy and it was so good!  Dessert - Red Bean Soup (hot).  Quite good!  All this for $68!  A really reasonable price for all these dishes.  The restaurant is a little out of the way but it's pretty darn good!    Wait service was attentive.  Turns out I recognized one of the wait staff and she also recognized me!"}
{"text":"If I give a company a five star review, they must really blow my socks off...Jessica, you little minx...where have you been all my life?  Hands down, the best Chinese food I have had in Calgary and I have lived here all my life.    Everything was cooked fresh to order and even the chicken fried rice was light, fluffy and tasted as if it was made just for us.  And the portions were generous.  We ordered everything from ginger chicken from the regular menu to beef ho fan from the \"authentic\" menu, all were exceptional as far as what we North American's would consider good Chinese food.  We ordered about 12 items and they were ready to pick up in 20 minutes!  And it was during the dinner rush.  What I really appreciated was how nice the guy taking our order was, we switched up a couple of items and sauces and he was super patient with me and even though his English was a bit broken, he got everything right.  A note: This restaurant does not give you a freebee dish, doesn't matter how much you order, they don't have specials, or coupons...but the quality speaks for itself, so it is not a loss whatsoever to me.  Also, they didn't give us hot sauce for those who like that extra kick but I guess we could have asked for it, seeing it was our first time, we didn't quite know the protocol.   Thanks to my fellow yelpers for their reviews, Jessica, child, you have a new fan!"}
