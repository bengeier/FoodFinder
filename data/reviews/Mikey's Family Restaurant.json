{"text":"Service was quick , pleasant waitress. Food had no flavor, it was a large portion but with no seasoning it was not a location I would recommend or go to again"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT.  Whether it's your first time or you've been coming here for a while you will always feel welcome.  It says a lot about a place when you see a steady flow of regulars that come in day in and day out.  Home cooking at it's best!!!  Been coming here for years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Great food served in a family friendly environment!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. .. Been eating at Mkes for a few years now and never a disappointment.  Food is always  hot and cooked  perfect.  Would  definitely  recommend."}
{"text":"If you are near this place, You're too far east for any better food or service. Most of the crowd here, especially during the winter, is snowbird seniors. Sturdy coffee and solid home-cooked meals all day long. Service is really slow (example one server for the entire place at breakfast), so bring a good friend to talk with, at length."}
{"text":"First, the food was really good....however, it wasn't exactly what we ordered. They messed up my daughter's order but, she said it still tasted good. Like others have said, this is a typical Mom & Pop place. I typically enjoy trying out these types of places. But, the waitress was less than \"cheery and bright\" and seemed too busy for us. It was a \"seat yourself\" place so I looked for a booth where we wouldn't have to sit on torn or cracked seats but, there weren't any. The menus were frayed and falling apart. And, the inside of the place looked rather dingy. If the food hadn't been as good, I would have given this place just 1 or 2 stars. I'm still on the fence as to whether I'd go there again or not."}
{"text":"Food portions were plentiful, though each breakfast meal was a bit bland in flavor. The biscuits and gravy were ok, as the biscuits were good but the gravy tasted floury and not much flavor to it but all the eggs were cooked to the style requested. The coffee was weak, along with the service. Our waitress botched the orders up and not all the meals were served on time. The ambience was a bit dark and the space is crammed to fit the tables it has."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here recently.  Food was just so so.  Eggs were fried too hard, corned beef hash was mushy, sausage patties were tough and dry.  The bacon was the only thing decent.  It was cooked to perfection and had a good flavor."}
{"text":"The price is great and the food is like a home cooked meal not the prettiest but you can roll out of bed have some bomb breakfast and not worry how you look"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! Price was very reasonable and the waitress was perfect she was kind and very helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"been going here for 20 years great place to eat. watched George grow up through the years good kid"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there. We had high hopes for this place but it was very  disappointing. First of all the waitress was a little snappish which was not appreciated. I don't think I have had worse biscuits and gravy in a long time. It was not even warm when served, and tasted like milk & flour - absolutely tasteless.  We thought the lumps were sausage but instead were clumps of flour.  Even hot it was not good. The people we were with said their meal was ok but not great. Sorry Mikey's but the last time we ate there before this the food was excellent. What happened ?"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally went. I had lunch a lunch sandwich and my daughter had an omelette. Both dishes were fantastic and plentiful. We both agreed it was just as good as our regular favorite place and we will go back again soon. The only issue was that the sign said to seat ourselves, which we did but waited an unusually long time for server to come with menus. They should have menus on the tables or easy access to them when seating yourself. Otherwise A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"Being from Long Island it is hard to find good comfort food in Arizona! And I've been out here since 1988!  They are a Greek family owned restaurant from New Jersey (close enough - wink)  From their creamy coleslaw to their baked fish, pork ribs, homemade soups & chili, to a simple ham/egg/cheese sandwich . . . It's all excellent! Portions are never skimped upon.  The place is nothing to look at. Heck, if I didn't go with a friend I would have passed this place by another 30 years!  Everything is made to your liking! And, the price \"ain't\" bad either!  It's the type of place where the waitress knows your name (as well as the owners - who do the cooking!). You recognize the same patrons because they come in just as much as you do!  We don't cook and we go out everyday! We can go to fancier more expensive restaurants. But it doesn't make much sense when you can get better quality food and service at a more reasonable price at Mikey's! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Been in a few times. Food is always very good. It's not the most modern place in town, so don't go expecting anything exquisite, but for a really good breakfast at a great price, this place always does the trick for us."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast.  Food was homemade and delicious.  Service was great.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"We found this little place in strip mall that is run down and didn't look very appealing. we pulled up and thought \"what the heck, lets go in\" I am glad we did.  It has a fairly large dining area, and it is seat yourself.  Waitress came over right away and the food was great!  I had Chicken fried steak and the gravy was fantastic after I added a little bit of salt. Husband had the Bacon burger and he said it was really good. the service was not very friendly, but I am ok with that. I do not like overly cheerful fake people anyways :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I like it every time. Service is always very fast and friendly and the food is very good. Everything is homemade and very high-quality"}
{"text":"Wonderful local family-owned restaurant. The service was excellent and menu choices were great. Nice clean restaurant. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you like liver and onions, you have to try Mikey's! It's the best we've had and the service is great as well as friendly! Sometime we will have to try something else:)"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and the food was good and the staff was good. The one thing I didn't like is that they charge a dollar if you use a credit card no matter how much the bill. I would understand if the required you to spend a minimum amount. Because of this,I won't go back. There are plenty of other breakfast diners that don't charge the dollar."}
{"text":"Delicious Spanish omelet and waitress let me substitute grilled tomatoes instead of home fries to stay on my low-carb diet. My friend had gyro meat and scrambled eggs with toast and home fries and said it, too, was delicious. Waitress was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. They did charge her a dollar to use her ATM card. I will be back soon. Recommended for breakfast. Large portions! And perfectly cooked. My friend loved the coffee."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint. They always make me feel at home. Good food, coffee and service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! This restaurant is off Main Street east of Ellsworth. It's clean, the food is simple, homestyle and served with a smile! You can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Mikeys cafe for breakfast this morning. Our first problem is the floor looked really filthy. I normally would use the restroom first (to see if it's clean) but didn't see one so we proceeded to order. We both ordered the Denver omelet for $9.50 each and thought it sounded a bit pricey but you also got home fries and toast. We discussed while we waited for our food that the waitress had zero personality and the cook didn't wear any rubber gloves, eek. Well the food came out very hot and tasted ok to me but was loaded with lots of onions of which I tasted until about noon. My wife didn't care for anything and ate almost nothing except the toast. Everything on the menu looked a bit expensive. We will not be back. Micky D's or Hackers would be a better option."}
{"text":"Tried out this little place for breakfast and I'm glad I did.  I love finding good old fashion diners and this place looked like it froze in time.  I was greeted with a smile and my coffee was poured right away.  The food was great and the service just as well.  In sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast at this quaint diner while on a morning bike ride.  Menu had lots of options to choose from. My kids ordered the Belgian waffles with ice cream! Fried eggs were cooked perfectly, apple pancakes were delicious... a definite place to come back to."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner because someone had suggested Micky D's. We were confused and wound up here by mistake. The server was nice, but the place was a little run down, and our food was pretty bad. However, the place was busy and the other customers (who looked like regulars, most over 70) seemed to love it so maybe it just wasn't our cup of tea. It sounds like breakfast might be something they do well, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food quick and good flavor.  Waitress are super friendly.  This place reminds me of a place my dad use to take me to many years ago. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this little diner.  We had a great waitress and eager pleasant service. Food was classic diner food. It was a nice little place to stop after hiking in the Usery Mountains.  My only complaint is that it is on Apache not Main.  GPS is correct, but at some point there was a street name change so be aware to turn on Apache. There is no Main Street this far east."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant was a little bit of a pleasant surprise. Their salad with blue cheese was exceptional. I had the fish and fries, and it was good not excellent. Our waitress worked extremely hard to serve all the folks in there at near closing time, and was pleasant. Pricing was mostly reasonable, with a really good variety of food served. I will return, and will recommend this little out-of-the-way restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Little place in strip mall food was decent , service was friendly"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I love breakfast food and generally when I eat out with my boyfriend, it's for breakfast.  The food wasn't bad, it was a typical mom n' pop type of restaurant... But the atmosphere inside was very sad. Plus there was no music playing overhead or in the background. So you were left to hear he mumbles of the elder while they were linking their forks and spoons on their dishes. Our waitress (who was the only server) looked like she was bothered by the fact we came into this restaurant. She was not very friendly. Which is okay, some days I hate going to work too, but at least make me feel like I'm not eating at a hole in the wall.   Like I said the food wasn't bad, it was typical breakfast food, but don't think you can bring a few friends or your family and feel a homey kind of feel you can get at several other restaurants in the easy Valley.  Decent food, however, will not return."}
{"text":"Good little find. Great home cooked fresh breakfast. Reasonably priced. Our waitress Laura was on it, coffee refills quickly, quick friendly service!"}
