{"text":"Excellent!

J'y suis allé deux fois et j'ai simplement adoré.

La deuxième fois c'était lors d'une sortie cabane à sucre du bureau et les commentaires étaient excellents."}
{"text":"La qualité de la nourriture est au rendez-vous. De plus, vous pouvez amener votre propre alcool. Nous avions de la bière à l'érable pour l'occasion. Les petits pains maisons étaient terriblement bons. L'omelette soufflée est quelque chose. Les fèves au lard et minis tourtières sont  très bonnes. Un seul dessert au menu. Le service était impeccable. J'y retournerai."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for two years in a row now, and the first year was a little better, but the place hasn't changed much and the food was exactly the same. The place is huge, and has several halls with long tables. The hall in front has the toilet, products shop (tourist-expensive prices - you can get the same stuff for less in any market in Montreal), and cash register (cash only!). You start off with some nice pickles, then peas soup and bread rolls with butter - don't eat too much bread - the best is yet to come! Afterwards dishes start to poor over the table - beans, potatos, smoked ham, little meat pies, interestingly served omelet in large metal skillet, pork crisps, and Buckwheat pancakes. I think the rule of thumb is \"if it goes well with maple syrup - it's on the menu\". There is maple syrup on the table and you can add that to whatever you like - including the coffee and tea served at the end. The desert was not good - it was sticky and hot dough with maple syrup. However the maple toffee served in the back yard between the maple trees is great.  Our second visit was on a warm day and the toffee didn't  harden enough - but was still delicious! 
It's a bring-your-own wine / beer place - so do! It's also an all you can eat stile and you can ask for seconds - but on our second visit a second the meat pies were 2$ extra per piece - which was a bit annoying (we still got them though - sooo gooood!). 
It's really fun to enjoy a meal here with friends and family - good for the whole family! They even have a small petting zoo.
The bottom line - for 28$ per person (+2$ extra for the meat pie, not including tip) I think they can do better. Though it's worth it once a year, to welcome spring!"}
{"text":"Première cabane à sucre que nous avons fait au Québec. 
La qualité et la quantité sont au rendez-vous. Les plats sont bons et bien assaisonnés. Tout est posé sur la table et chacun se sert ce qu'il souhaite. À part pour les parts de tourtières qui sont limitées à une par personne. 
Le service est aimable et rapide, peut-être trop parfois. Une petite déception concernant le dessert, on aurait souhaité en avoir plusieurs afin de goûter différentes spécialités comme c'était le cas pour les plats. 
Une bonne découverte quand même des les spécialités culinaires québécoises."}
{"text":"One of my Coworkers is from the Lachute area and decided he was going to take us out for a classical Canadian experience. When we got to the Sugar Shack (as he called it) I realized that he was right, this was as traditional as it gets. The building could have been an old farm house that had been converted to a restaurant. Before dinner we walked around and got some sap directly from the trees to drink.
 Dinner was a very family feeling meal. You sat at a long table with everyone else and they just keep bring you all sorts of food. We had pea soup, bread, baked beans, omelett, pancakes, and more. Of course you had the option to drown everything in their homemade syrup. When dinner was over we went outside and they poured boiling syrup onto the snow and we ate it with pop sickle sticks. I left with a can of syrup a full stomach. If you are in the area and looking for an authentic Canadian experience, this is the place."}
{"text":"Meh, mediocre food. Pros: ham, fluffy eggs, beans and pea soup.  Cons: uber salty pork rinds, bland not cooked enough potatoes, dry and bland tourtière."}
