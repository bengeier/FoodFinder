{"text":"Very friendly service & extremely large portions.  They treat you as if you are a guest in their home.    The restaurant is outdated.  It needs a good sprucing along with the washroom.  They ran out of soap and water was added to the bottle.  There was no point, it was like rinsing your hands in water.    The food is good & satisfying.   The salad dressing is light and fresh.   The hummus & baba ganoush is just the way I like it - not too much tahini.   Falafel tastes like they're prepared from a box like most restaurants.  Chicken skewers & breast and beef/lamb skewers are moist and tender.  Not a huge fan of the spice they use but it did need a touch more salt along with the rice."}
{"text":"Great place - exquisite cuisine, peaceful atmosphere. Whether you choose to take out or eat in, you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Not as good as they used to be compared to a few years ago. I think they changed owners or something. Still good but not the greatest."}
{"text":"My friend ate here so I joined him. The chicken kebab didnt really taste like chicken the texture wasnt right. He apparently enjoyed his food but mine was horrible. Got my stomach upset too."}
{"text":"We swung by this place for a quick bite to eat before picking up our kid from a birthday party at the nearby pottery place. Got a plate of pita with 5 different kinds of hummus. God, it was good! We had no clue there were so many kinds of this good stuff. On the expensive side though, particularly if you also order drinks which I recall were more than $2 a piece."}
{"text":"I went to pita paradise with a certificate I purchased online, but found out that since they were under new ownership they could not take it,  but the owner offered me a great discount and dessert on the house to try them out.  I was thourghly impressed with the owners attempt to make me a returning customer and service was excellent not to mention the food.  try the baklava it's to die for. Will definetly return to this place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Stopped in for lunch and had the shwarma plate. It was delicious and fresh. The salad is very flavourful. The chicken was delicious too. Homemade hot sauce is not too spicy but nice flavour m  Owners are very friendly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not the best shawarma place ever. The staff don't even welcome you properly inside, they just give you the menu and sit at the front doing nothing. The food was not as good, there was something hard in my food which could have broken my tooth had I not know. The salad is also not fresh and taste different. The chicken also, not as good. I would not recommend this place at all..first time trying and will not go here again! The place needs renovations, looks old and feels dark and gloomy! Staff doesn't even make you feel welcomed or anything, and just sit around on their phone. Worst place ever..."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Greek food and happened upon this place while at Desert Ridge with the family. As typical of my wife and I, we each ordered something that appealed to us and ate family style. Ordered Kafka sandwich and Beef kabob. The food went over rather well with us, the Beef Kabob used higher grade beef and the Kafka Sandwich had really good flavor. We sat out on the front patio and enjoyed people watching. The waitress was very accommodating to my little girl that just wanted to run around, especially since there was a water fountain to play with close by.  I will say this, the prices almost kept us away, they seemed a bit high for Greek food, but the quality of the food and the nice waitress helped to soften the bill when it arrived."}
{"text":"I remember Pita Paradise throughout the last 15 yrs give or take and it must have gone through another owner change.  Food is ok, owner is Afghani so has little more Afghan style food but all in all its a fast food Shawarma and falafel place, nothing special really."}
{"text":"Stopped here for take out lunch. I ordered the shish kabob sandwich. The beef and lamb combo was pretty tasty with a little kick of spice but not too hot. It was cooked medium which is how I like it. It was a good sandwich.  My problem with this place is that the man I presume to be the owner hands me my sandwich in a hurry and says have a nice day. I said, \"doesn't this come with fries or something?\" to which he promptly replied No! As the owner or even manager he undoubtedly knows the menu says all sandwiches come with fries, roasted potatoes or rice, which I pointed out to him. He says \"I can give you potatoes\" like he's doing me a favor without giving me a choice. The potatoes were good, and I might have chosen them but that's irrelevant.   To top it all off, he put my sandwich in the bag upside down so the open end was spilling into the bottom of the bag. The food was pretty decent but I won't be going back to a dishonest place like this."}
{"text":"I agree with Shannon's review in that Pita Paradise has a great location in the middle of the Desert Ridge shopping center.  I stopped in there last night (Sunday) at prime time for dinner (7:15ish).  There were some people eating there, but I placed an order to-go as we were trying to make it to a movie.    I had the falafel pita sandwich and it came with french fries and a small greek salad.  It was tasty... I've had better, but what do you expect from a mediterranean place in the middle of a North Phoenix shopping center?!  I would go back...  The staff was very friendly and the owner even through in a small container for me to sample their hummus!  If you want kebabs, falafel, gyro, hummus, greek salad, or anything of the sort, and you find yourself in North Phoenix, check this place out !  :)"}
{"text":"The sample of hummus outside is enough to draw me in.  It was really great hummus!  The gyro was very good, and a very good size portion.  I would recommend coming in for lunch, or try to catch the belly dancing and live int'l band on Friday or Saturday nights.  It's a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"I dropped in because I saw a sign saying \"2 shwarmas for $9 with free pop\". I enquired if I could get the 2 shwarma special - and the gentleman behind the counter confirmed that was the case for $10 I thought no big deal, just one more dollar and I was hungry  He sent for another girl to make my order because he had to step out  When I was talking to the girl making my order she informed me that the drink was not part of the deal And when she rung up my total to $14 after taxes (not $11.30) - This is because the deal was only active from 3-5pm (and I had came in after 5). The confusion turned me off a bit but the shwarmas themselves  were very hearty and full of flavour.   The ambiance is quiet, the lighting could definitely improve and the atmosphere feels a little forced. Its a great place to take food out but its not the best place to have dinner with friends in person in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great owner who is nice, talkative, thoughtful, and cares about his business and customers. I only ever get the chicken shawarma but I think it is the best in the area. Generous portions too! And at the time of writing, they have lunch special 2 chicken shwarma sandwich for $9. I do recommend."}
{"text":"Pita Paradise hasn't been open long. They actually may have only been open a few months, but I'm not sure.  The location of this restaurant is primo.  They're right in the middle of Desert Ridge, close to the movie theaters and other stores.    The atmosphere is nice and the food is mediterranean.  Pita's, gyros, falafel, kebabs etc, can be found on the menu.  The time I went, it was pretty busy in there.  It was around lunch time, but the servers still managed to hold it together.    But the time of day just doesn't matter with Desert Ridge.  No matter when you go, it will always be busy.  I've always wondered why too. How can that many people be shopping during the day?  Don't these people have jobs? Anyways, so my guess is that Pita Paradise will probably always be a little busy, but the food is good, so check it out."}
{"text":"Tried their Shawarma plate. Chicken portion was poor but the taste was ok. There are plenty of Shawarma places in the area that offer better value. Owner was prompt and polite in serving."}
{"text":"The good place for shawarma. It comes wraped in warm toasted pita with all the veggies and served with a delicious tahini sauce. The hummos is ridiculously great. I use to always went there for shawarma sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience dining late night at Pita Paradise this past Friday.  I went with two friends and the boyfriend.  :)  I liked the ambience of the place, since they had Middle Eastern music videos on tv and then a live dj playing some exciting ethnic tracks.  The location was great!  We ate there before going to a movie at AMC.  I ordered the Veggie Combo entree, which they were able to create as a single order, since it is usually a dish for \"two\" to share.  It was beautiful!  Presentation was lovely, and the food was also very tasty.  It came with fried and sauced zuchini and eggplant, caprese with dill and other herbs, spanakopita that was out-of-this-world, and falafel with the obligatory side of tabouli.  It was all very tasty.  The hostess outside also said the entire menu was organic.  The taste was really exceptional.  My only complaint is that everything was fried (except the tabouli and the caprese).  When I eat organic, I hope for that healthy-full feeling in my tummy, but grease kinda takes away from that a little.  :)  My boyfriend had the chicken shwarma and loved it!  I sampled some of his basmati rice, which was really tasty!  Our friends both ordered kebabs, and they were happy too.  Oh!  And $1 bottled beers and $3 you-call-it's!?!  That's so awesome, and we took advantage!  ;)  All in all, this was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for lunch. Very big fan of their shawarma plates and i recently tried the koobideh which has now become one of my faves! The owner always treats me and my colleague like family. Great  service! Always satisfied"}
{"text":"I can't understand how this perfect location doesn't do more business.  Unless it's prime hours friday and saturday night, it's just never busy whenver I go here or walk by when visiting Desert Ridge.  Falafel is ok, fries are ok, hummus is ok, but service is often substandard and this is extremely frustrating when it is not busy.  If it's not busy, what are you doing?   Prices are in line with other restaurants at Desert Ridge, but given that the food isn't spectacular I'll just go elsewhere for my falafel fix."}
