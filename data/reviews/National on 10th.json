{"text":"I have been here a lot in the past and never had an issue but went here the other night and the guys at the door would not let me in. He said I was wearing improper footwear to enter the bar. I was wearing black shoes that were in decent shape and I say many other people getting in with no issues. I asked to talk to the manager and I was told there was no manager on duty. I was not impressed at all and will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"National on 10th is an excellent addition to the Calgary bar scene.  My friend and I started out there for dinner and ended up staying the whole night.  We both had a cheese burger and house salad.  The burger was juicy and the bun was fresh.  It was a pretty good size. I was satisfied when I finished it.  The house salad as my side was excellent.  The dressing was sweet and peppery. The other bonus is the drink menu. There are plenty of options to choose from and also plenty of sizes.  I was drinking steins as it was the most value for my money. The beer I had was the Ribstone Creek.  It was a good lager with a lighter flavor and went well with my burger. The beer there was chilled to the perfect temperature.  I will definitely be going back here again and again. 

Go there for dinner and stay for the night!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is on point. DJ is on point.

Line outside is awful. Not even full when you get in and they use that lame 'capacity' excuse on you, 

Aside from that, the crowd is live and the drinks are always flowing.  Don't come on the weekend if you are looking for space or quiet. The party os too strong (that is a good thing)!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with my Hubby and we were not disappointed.  He ordered the prime rib sammie and I had the steak sammie and we shared each of them.  The prime rib sandwich was amazing...so tender, no fat at all and delicious!  The pickle was a good addition on the side.  The steak sandwich was good as well as the fried egg on it and the onion rings were very tasty.  We will definitely be back.  Service was pretty good overall as it was pretty busy for a Friday night and the food came out relatively quickly."}
{"text":"I usually love the National but the server we had today was awful! She was visibly stressed even though the restaurant wasn't full. She was abrupt with all of us, no smile, no hello, nothing. WE have team lunches here a lot and we love the girls there. Our drinks were pretty much thrown on the table to the point that we mopped up the mess after she left, no apologies.

Now on to the food, I am a Celiac and the buns are no good unless they are toasted or warm, which they normally do without being asked. This time was disappointing, the bun was hard and cold and I left half of it because it crumbled in my hands."}
{"text":"This would have been a 4-5 star review if it weren't for the door staff, a group of us went outside for a cigar and upon re entry the rest of my group was okay to come back inside but apparently the designated driver (me) was too drunk to come back inside?
Its this behaviour that will keep me from returning to this establishment!"}
{"text":"All the girls headed down to The National on 10th Ave for a birthday party on Tuesday night. We had made reservations for 6:30 at the bar and then 8:00 for bowling. At 6:28 the birthday girl got a call asking if we still wanted our reservation... Of course we do, and it's not 6:30 yet! Guess they were turning people away at that point. Luckily our table was available when we arrived although we had a few uninvited guests sitting with us.

The service was a little slow to start, but maybe our server was waiting for the rest of our party to trickle in because once everyone was there, the service was great. We all shared the tater tots to start (unusual for a bar and we loved them!) and then each had our own entrees. Everything came our perfectly and was delicious! Everyone had something different and everyone enjoyed their meal. The hot beef ciabatta with short rib and oxtail ragu was fabulous!!

My only piece of constructive feedback would to be to replace the stools on the main floor. The seat is really high and the foot bar is too low so a short lady in heels is left dangling like a little kid!

After eating entirely too much we headed downstairs to the bowling alley. Clean and new with great service. We were a few minutes late for our reservation but they were good with it as there was no line up to bowl at that time. Lots of lounge space as well if you happen to be waiting for a lane or want to play any multitude of games they have set up. Cool leather couches, decent (but not fabulous) wine and new shoes~ how could a girl complain! 

I will need to bring my Hubs here one day to experience the Bourbon Room. A place where he can get a flight of bourbon, a scotch egg and deep friend pickles~ he will think he has died and gone to heaven!"}
{"text":"this place unfortunately gets a lot of business because the food is decent and it's big with a fairly cool design. I've been there approx once a week for 2 years since we moved to Calgary, and if it wasn't for ping pong (bc ping pong is awesome) we would never go. Of all the bars I've been to in the world, this is one of the least customer centric establishments. There is something dreadfully wrong with their taps, as the beer routinely tastes weird, and we would know because we get the beer at other bars. The management is so focused on making a nickel that they don't even consider what the customers might want. I've had light turned off on me in part of the bar because the \"ambiance\" wasn't right, we have stood at the bar for over 10 minutes with no line, just ignored. I've had seats taken away from me because of some arbitrary reason. This was all done by there management, something feels wrong at the core at this place. If you want a local feel where you're treated well, try elsewhere."}
{"text":"First off - love the space inside and how open it is! Food was great. My veggie burger WITH alfalfa sprouts was fantastic. (I'm a sucker for anything with sprouts) My boyfriend's prime rib sandwich was one of the best he's ever had. I called prior to ask about a gluten free menu as I didn't see anything noted on their website and was told that gluten free options were available and indeed they were. I had a gluten free bun with my veggie burger (courtesy of Care Bakery as per the server) and it was delicious! Highly recommend adding the gluten free options to the menu/website, or at least mentioning that they are available! And it would be wonderful to have a veggie burger without the panko breading too! That's me being picky though. And the service was just OK this time. We will be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for beer & bourbon, 3.5 for bowling, 3 for food. Great $5 flat rate for all 20 ounce pints during happy hour, plus buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays. Huge bourbon selection and a secluded tasting room. Awesome.  

The rest of the menu sounds pretty good too, but is unremarkable upon arrival (Craft next door is better for food, not as good for drinks). The bowling in the basement is fun, but isn't worth the really long wait time unless you are a very patient kind of person. The Ping pong and foosball are much more accessible and appreciated. I like the lively atmosphere and the communal tables, now if they'd only open up the rooftop patio at some point they'd get bumped up to 4 stars overall."}
{"text":"Nice to have the beer selection, but the cost can be prohibitive. I find the communal tables don't necessarily work in practice but it's nice to try something different."}
{"text":"I always have fun here. Nice, big, open space. 

If you want to go bowling in the basement, get there early. It's a very nice alley, but it fills up fast (for a good reason) so get your name on the list. 

For all my fellow DDs... There's a parkade right across the street, and I think it's 2-5 bucks for 12 hours or something, so that is super convenient and I utilize that often. 

The food is really good too. I'm a sucker for deep fried pickles, and I could eat these by the pound. I would also recommend the Mac and cheese and the ribs (hard to go wrong with their sliders or burgers, too).

Good beer selection, fun music."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Love the atmosphere and they have a great selection of beer on tap. With live music it does get very loud, so talking with your table mates can be difficult. 

Really enjoyed to Sliders...so yummy. As well as the Duck Poutine. Usually duck is very greasy, but the duck here was delicious! Definitely going to head back here."}
{"text":"Decent ambiance and beer selection. Service ranges from good to lousy. Food good but can be greasy."}
{"text":"3 of my friends and I all have our birthdays in the beginning of December so we all decided to celebrate together. We decided on National because of the location. We really should have gone to Craft, but nothing can be done about that now. We were a small group, probably about 12 - 14 people came and went throughout the night. All of them paying their tabs and tipping before leaving. Little did we know that our server was allowing them all to pay, but not removing their drinks or food items from the bill. So when the bill comes at the end of the night and everyone has put in the money for what they have had and tipping on their part of the bill we are still short. We tell our waitress that there is something wrong but she claims the bill is correct and walks away. Feeling guilty that someone may have left without paying their bill we all pitch in extra to cover the rest and a tip for the waitress. Everyone celebrating their birthday that night ended up paying double or more. I paid $300 for a burger, a poutine and a few beer. 
     After talking to our friends over the next few days we found out that they had all paid. They told us when they were paying their tabs before leaving the waitress told them that she was not supposed to split items off the bill and not to tell anyone that she was doing it. I found this really suspicious as every restaurant I have ever been to can easily split a bill so each person can pay their own portion, but maybe this establishment has some strange rule against it. After going over the bill with every one of our friends that attended, we made a list of the items that had been paid for and that the waitress had been tipped for twice. We called to speak to a manager and inform them of what had happened, they said they would speak to the waitress to see if she remembered anything about it. After about 4 days we finally heard back from the manager that they would reimburse us for the items that we had paid for twice but nothing more. They didn't do anything about the fact that we had tipped twice on every item in addition to the mandatory 20% Gratuity that was automatically added to our bill. Nothing. They did the bare minimum. All they did was give back some of the money they had wrongly taken from us. 
      After driving for an hour to go  pick up the money they were going to give back, the manager apologized and said if we ever came back they would buy us a drink. I am certain nobody from our group that attended that night will ever be returning."}
{"text":"So my brother, my husband and I thought we would check out national on 10th today to grab something to eat & drink while we watch the Senator vs Canadians game. When we walked in we found the ping pong room it was a pretty sweet set up so we decided to watch the game from there. After about 10 minutes we asked the servers if we could have a couple menus and if they could put the hockey game on the tvs in that room. It took a while but eventually they put the game on.  While we waited for a server to come take our food and drink orders we occupied our selves with ping pong. To the point...
After an hour of watching server after server walk by and ignore us we decided to head next door to Craft Beer Market to eat and watch the rest of the game. 
So basically of you want to go play ping pong and your not picky about what your watching ntnl on 10th is a great place to go. If you want to order food and drinks and each a specific sporting event go next door to Craft!"}
{"text":"After our meeting, a vendor offered to take my coworker and I out to lunch and I suggested we try out the newly opened National close by. Since it was only 11:30 it wasn't busy yet and we got seated right away. It's a relatively large venue (they have a bowling alley downstairs!) and tables are nicely spaced apart so it's not too crowded.

The four of us got seated in the middle of an enormous benched table (one of the vendors mentioned the set up is like a German beer hall) and our waitress quickly came over with menus. Chalkboard tablets on pillars inform you of the beer specials and the large tally board (it looks like those old school train station schedules) lists the plethora of beers they have available.

I ordered on the Strawberry Lemonade (bourbon, strawberry and homemade lemonade) and all four of us got burgers. Since the ground beef is actually ground in house, the waitress informed us we had an option of how we wanted our burgers cooked (I still went with well done).

Our food came out pretty quick, the burger was dressed with fresh lettuce and tomato on a bun adorned with a sliced pickle. The burger was a good size, I managed to eat it all without feeling overly full. (I'm a fry fanatic so I thought the little tin cup of fries was a bit disappointing, but that's just me!)

I enjoyed my experience, I will defintiely be back with my beer and burger loving boyfriend soon!"}
{"text":"I went to national for lunch an got the Clive sliders. They were okay but just lacked the taste. It left me watering over the burger my partner got! I wasn't too fond of the fries because they were way too crunchy! But if you like extreme crunchiness, this is your place! The service was friendly but a little slow considering it wasn't that busy. Beer selection was great & the coffees actually pretty decent (if you're a coffee drinker like me). I also found the place to be really cold but that probably depends on the day. 

I'm excited to go back for bowling some night though!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favourite National. They have a great space; it feels like a good pub but has way better flow than the one on 17th. It seems cleaner too which is always nice. And the crowd seems to be a little more in line with my somewhat aging demographic.

Of course they have a gazillion beers available, priced fairly but not cheaply. There is something for everyone taste wise, regardless of how much you know about beer. They have fun appies (deep fried pickles - yay!) and tasty main dishes should you want to take in a meal. I like the burgers a lot. 

The tables are all communal - sometime this is fun and other times a little less depending on who you are sharing with and how good they are at sharing. It adds to the friendly vibe of the place though.

Service is good - down to earth people who are not dressed like Barbies and who are allowed to have their own personalities (what a novel idea!).

There is a big parkade across the street which is nice if you don't feel like going on a quest for street parking. In the evenings and on weekends is super cheap."}
{"text":"I tried to go bowling there once with my friends, and the wait was about two or three hours. The food wasn't stellar (I had a chicken sandwich special) ,  it was too loud,  and the service was slow. All in all,  not a fan."}
{"text":"I didn't know what a Canadian bro was until I went to the National. I enjoyed some beers and got bumped into on purpose only to be followed by a sincere apology. Weird. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"1st time here was Femme Wave 2017. I've since been back. I've had the Mac and Cheese as well as the Chicken and Biscuits and both was really good. The lighting is very accommodating and the space is very clean. The seating is not very comfortable and is not arranged so that live gigs hosted there are visible from any table that isn't the front 2."}
{"text":"Looks ok but half of the restaurant was booked for private functions an the staff did not care about us being there. We were asked to sit at the end of the bar where half of the stools were missing and the ambiance was... lacking.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Good solid place for lunch. Seems like a fun place with foosball, bubble hockey, and table tennis. Bowling alley looks very nice, a perfect place for a long corporate lunch.

Best deal is the big breakfast, and top marks for the fish tacos. Still need a bit of work to reach the food level of National on 17th, but with some work they should get there."}
{"text":"First time at National was a good one, but mostly because our server was amazing! The beer selection and the knowledge of our server was quite impressive. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the menu however when our food arrived I found it to be tasty.
We ordered the fish tacos, beet salad and poutine to share. The poutine had an amazing homemade flair and the fish tacos were served with a \"build your own\" concept which was fun. I found the beet salad to have just too much dressing which weighed down the flavours and made everything just too oily, which then made me stay away from the fried goat cheese balls that were on top.

I will like to come back again but probably just for a few more pints."}
{"text":"Good service and beer recommendations,
worth a visit, expect a wait late night, though big, busy places like this, it is not uncommon.  It is a fun place just to hang out with a group!"}
{"text":"So I came in for Canada Day to grab some Canadian cooking. Being American, trying to make poutine was a sad endeavor, but National did it right! The three bacon poutine! The hand cut fries, the melty cheese curds, the bacon, the chives, the bacon, the gravy, oh and did I mention the bacon? National is doing Canada proud! 

To wash it all  down, why some good Canadian beers to go with it. With how rich and delicious the poutine is, I went with the tool shed people skills ale. Creamy and medium bodied, it paired perfectly with the food. 

But if that isn't your style, national has 65 (!) Other beers for you to try. Or if beer isn't your thing, they have plenty of the hard stuff and some wine too."}
{"text":"I rarely (actually never) had to send food back to the kitchen in any restaurant. I, unfortunately, had to send my food back and ... it never came back!!! The bill was brought for the full meal with no delays though. If I could give zero stars, I would"}
{"text":"I used to love this place as a spot to gather with friends, but as of recent they have changed how they organize their night life and the quality of my experience there has severely declined. Staff have been quite rude and unaccommodating, and there are noticeably less people who make this their bar of choice nowadays. Best find yourself a new place to spend your weekend nights."}
{"text":"I've been to National on 17th, and I enjoy it. National on 10th just opened up and as a few things to iron out, and I'm sure once they do, they'll be just as rad. 

I was here with a few friends (and strangers) last night and while service was friendly, it was pretty inattentive. We sat there for over two hours and most of it was spent waiting for our waitress to come back. She asked us if we needed more time deciding what to drink, and then disappeared for twenty minutes. When she finally came back, we were not only ready to drink, we were also ready to order food, but she said she needed to come back for that. Nearly ten minutes later she came back to take our food orders. 

None of our orders were overly complicated either: veggie burger, two plates of crackers and beer cheese, couple of turkey burgers. Food here tastes exactly like it does on 17th, so no surprises there. Fries are good, and I love the habanero hot sauce they have on every table. If you order the 3 oz Dark and Stormy as opposed to the 1.5 oz, you'll save money and also get a Costco Edition Dark and Stormy. It was as big as my torso. I needed a nap and a cuddle afterward.

If one of the ladies at our table hadn't finally gotten up in frustration to flag down our waitress so we could settle up, we'd probably still be waiting. Looking around, it wasn't particularly busy, so I'm not exactly sure what the hold up was. I think the waitress mentioned something about the kitchen. Get it together, National 10th! Then, we can be homies!"}
{"text":"Food is decent here but it has unacceptably slow service. We have been here over an hour for lunch and still do not have our food. Even getting drinks was painful where it took 15 minutes to pour a beer. National needs to do something about their staffing issues if they want to keep anyone's business. For basic bar food that is overpriced and requires an hour and half to have lunch, it is not worth coming! Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Fun afternoon of bowling on a Sat afternoon!
We were only in the lower level but for sure a place I would return to with friends!
The space was large, clean and bowling was a hoot! Lanes worked well and worth a ton of laughs!
Staff super friendly, good beer (more selection upstairs apparently and a different menu)
The tacos were deelish with a hint of clove (love a stray from the ordinary) and the nachos and guac\salsa always a good choice. The churros were to die for! Choose between chocolate dip or dulce de leche! Both amazing!
A really fun time and I look forward to a night out here another day!!!"}
{"text":"National always is good for atmosphere, the one on tenth has a bowling alley and other games in the basement

Their food is a litter below average. I enjoyed the beer selection, as they has many of brand beers you cant get elsewhere"}
{"text":"I have to say I've been to National many times and never had issues with the service. But  when tried booking a reservation for an activity it has to be done online. The issue with the online reservation is that is very deficient they would ask for how many people, date, time and space you are looking to reserve and even if you have any questions and then they will reply to you with a generic answer basically asking all over what you had already provided.

So my 1st email was on Friday requesting for a reservation for 20 next Wednesday, the person (Mariel Jacobo) responded back to me on Monday (basically asking what I had already providing in advance and not answering any of my questions) I responded back on Monday during business hours but had to wait until Tuesday the end of the day for an answer, I responded back but did not receive a response on time for the activity.

So the day of the activity we arrived and we had NO RESERVATION, even through I sent this on Friday. My only question back to her was the time that kids are permitted in the venue! That was my question since day 1 she didn't answer, second time I asked she provided incorrect information as I was not receiving any answers from her I went on Monday and asked myself.

But at the end of the day we had no issues getting a table as the place was not full, but for me was frustrated spending my time making sure to have a reservation and having all info upfront was a waste of time.

The funny thing is that she even had the nerve to respond to my last email... you know when?... they day after the event!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a team building event, so we had lunch and then bowled downstairs.  First the food - very, very good.  We decided to do a \"share\", so we ordered all the appetizers and everyone had a sample of what landed.  The best thing I had was the Mussels and fries - these fries as EXCELLENT by themselves, but you put them in a broth with mussels, it turned into this wonder dish of taste.  We also ordered their duck and lobster poutine, I liked the Mussels and fries much better.  Also had some fresh oysters since it was Tuesday, so was buck-a-shuck.  Very fresh.  To finish off had their DF mars bars and apple crumble.  Delish as well.  So, for the food - 5 / 5.  Atmosphere was like a beer garden, very roomy, high ceilings.  Also - LOTS of beer on tap, they have two screens listing the beers.  Also we had a really fun nice server.

Bowling lanes downstairs - who knew?? A lot of fun - no real pressure, just laughs.  There was something weird about out Lane 8 though.  The bowling ball would get stuck and then the next person would only get to throw one ball because the stuck one became unstuck and counted as a gutter.  Still a lot of fun.  Also had ping pong, arcade game and foozball.  Just one star off for the ball getting stuck all the time, and also for the street parking which made it hard to find a spot.  Two pay lots close by though."}
{"text":"I want this place to be a 5 pretty bad, but pubs are about service! More on that later.. But now, what does NTNL10 have going for it?

The beer selection is truly notable. Between this place and Beer Revolution, you are covered for artisan and unique beers without having to touch Craft. National has all the local brews, as well as a couple obscurities from the east and west coast, Montana, and other states. 

So far so good on the food! Reasonably priced and large quantities make for great pub fare. After a couple of visits, I have to recommend the small charcuterie plate for $28. Lots of food here, and they'll bring you extra crustinis if you ask. I've been lucky enough to get a pretty awesome spread each time--it's always a little different. Tuesday is $1 oyster night and--fear not--they are pretty good quality. As good as can be expected for Calgary at least. For the price, they are solid and come with two sauces; a mustardy-ginger sauce and a wine based vinagrette type sauce. Both are good. The duck poutine is as you'd expect--crispy, fatty, awesomeness. Very large portion, so the price is justified.

The bowling alley is beautiful, but I am told it won't open till October. Spend some time at the foosball table or playing ping pong. 

But, when it comes to service, you have to be able to hold the fort. Pubs are supposed to be warm and inviting places. Slight disclaimer; I am firmly against this trend we are seeing in Alberta where many pubs transform into pub clubs after 10pm. I have to say that National doesn't quite get to those levels, but the service absolutely thins out as the place fills up. This may be no fault of the servers, and more than likely an issue with management and hiring--a recurring problem on 10th Ave it would seem. Service starts good, but our server would often become impossible to find later in the night. Before it got really busy, our server was very friendly, prompt, and offered suggestions. I'm a pretty low-maintenance customer, but I still like some attendance when I want to keep shelling out money for expensive beers! 

Lots of potential here, and it's already much better than anything else near by. I sincerely hope to update my review soon with better results. But for now, I'd recommend visiting for an after-work brew and dinner. Take off before it gets crazy!"}
{"text":"After waiting in line in the freezing cold for almost an hour to attend a friends going away party, the bouncer rudely informed us that you have to be 25 to be allowed in on Fridays and Saturdays. This is a load of bull as the legal age is 18 and people who we're let in before us were 19 and 20 years old. The discrimination at this bar is disgusting. Upon going home we searched their website looking for the age restriction and found none. Overall very unhappy with this experience. Unfortunately you can't rate zero stars."}
{"text":"What a place to come and have a great evening.

The communal table, large beer list and decor make for a great experience. 
We dropped in for a few drinks and snacks before our night out. It was packed on Friday night, but everyone was willing to shuffle over and make room.

The beer list is expansive, plus they have several large TV's that show the status of all the beers they serve, it was a nice touch.

We had the wings, a little light in size for the $14 price tag, but still great tasting. The place had such a great vibe, the lights, oversized fans and the free ping pong tables!!

I didn't head into the bourbon room, my biggest regret, but next time I will head straight into the room to take a look and have a few.

Also there is a bowling alley under the restaurant that will be open in October. 

Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Love this location! Not a big fan of the 17th ave location, but this one is epic. It's huge, lots of space, nice bathrooms, and always had a good time. 

We've always gone to the bar to get our drinks, instead of waiting, it's also later so just easier. Plenty of seating, plus standing room so you're good. There are ping pong tables in the upstairs part, and a bowling alley in the basement, which I can't wait to check out!

I honestly can't say if the prices seem reasonable or not, there is usually a few drinks on the go and we order rounds. 

None the less, fun place to go hang out at!"}
{"text":"I've been to the National on 10th several times but let's shove aside all the playthings. You know what I'm referring to, the bowling alley, ping pong tables, short skirts...these are things boys fiddle and diddle with.

Daddies (and Ladies) it's time we talk about the Bourbon Room.

The first time I ever heard of this place was when I followed the legendary Wendy up from a CIA party. I huddled behind her like a scared puppy wondering what this dark room was. At the time there was some private function and everyone was dressed in bacon.

But the second time I came back as a man, if not a man, at least a well prepared individual. I skipped the trouble of being turned around by making a reservation, which was an effortless and engaging experience. Kudos to Stephen and the social media/twitter folks of the National for booking us a spot.

The bourbon room is great. Actually, it's BEYOND great. If one manages to book a spot here on a weekend night, it's perfect for casually hopping out of your ferrari or newly washed car and being let in at the door because your name is on the list. Then there's the feeling of slicing through the near-drunk and sweaty crowd and letting them eye you in envy as you make your way up to the secret room they couldn't seem to get into.

At the bourbon room it's all about the bourbon. Their menu boasts an extensive list of bourbons even an expert (or at least one who thought they've seen enough youtube videos to believe they were) sit in awe. But we weren't bourbon experts, personally I prefferred Tequila, while my hombre-from-another-madre liked his peaty scotches. But our waitress, Fern, was very sweet, she visited us frequently through the night and was excited to make recommendations based on our general preferences with spirits. I preferred sweeter finishes so she boldly brought me a few suggestions that I really enjoyed. Afterwards, they were kind enough to write down what I had on a card.

Also ending review by saying how National makes amazing lobster poutine. LOBSTER POUTINE. And scotch eggs. Now shuttup and fight me like a man."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE with all sorts of fun things everywhere. I've been here about 3 times now and each time I've realized it really is only the tip of the iceberg.

Trip 1: I learned that they have a LOT of beer on tap. I learned that their pints are 20oz and that it's around $8 for every beer. Depending what you like to drink, it's either gonna be a ripoff or a GREAT deal. I gotta love a place that essentially rewards me for having very expensive taste in beer. I learned about the picnic table style seating and I learned that I like it. Even if you don't wind up talking with your neighbours, chances are you'll tap them on the shoulder to ask \"is anyone sitting here?\" That's still a little more inter group interaction than you may find at many places. I learned that 20oz pints of high proof beer are both a way to \"drunk more the booze than realize you think did hammered lots I love everyone,\" As well as lighten up your wallet real fast. I ordered food this night too. I'm sure it was tasty, but I'll have to get back to you on that...

Trip 2: They have a bowling alley?! Heck yah! 8 lanes of awesome! Bowling ALWAYS comes up as a first date idea, why had it taken until now for a place to make it cool?! National 10's bowling alley is a super cool place to party.

Trip 3: I learned they have $5 any pint happy hour, a private upstairs level and private bar for around 60 people with a rock solid table tennis set up! I also learned that their wait staff are freaking gorgeous. Not sure why it took me this long to pick up on that.

I'm excited to find out what I'll learn with my next visit to National 10!"}
{"text":"So much fun was had here on Canada Day by myself and a group of friends. It was amazing the only downside was that there were a few times we were passed up by the bartenders to help people that were behind us.  Maybe they didn't see us?- giving the benefit of the doubt even though it happened a few times until we sat down at a table on the outside area then we were waited on and didn't see the neglect we saw earlier. But again overall fun place, clean bathrooms, decent prices, nice outside area."}
{"text":"Oh where do I start? My wife and I went in specifically for the Beyond burger, which is a delicious type of veggie burger that was advertised on the menu. They didn't have it. Ok. 
I ordered a pint of Deschutes IPA. They just ran out. Ok. 
I ordered the regular veggie burger. After 25 minutes our server came out and said sorry it's taking so long they dropped my burger on the floor and had to make a new one. Ok. 
There was literally about 4 people in the bar at this point. 
My burger comes out and I swear to God the cheese on the burger was processed Kraft Singles. Look like them and tasted like them. This is a $17 burger. 
After all that our bill comes. They didn't knock 10 or 20% off for all the trouble. They didn't buy me a beer or a knock any money off the meal. 
I'm never going back to this place. For a restaurant that is next door to Craft Beer Market, which has a bigger beer selection and a better menu, you'd think they'd take better care of the customers who come through their door."}
{"text":"Such a fun beer hall!  The new National on 10th is HUGE!  Complete with bowling in the basement, tons of different seating areas, and a pool room.  Much more spacious than the 17th Ave location, with the same great selection of craft beers.  I had a blast here with my friends - definitely a place we will come back to again."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have had in years.  Do not spend one cent here ever!!!   Completely screwed us after pre paying almost 1K for a stag.  Worst bar ever."}
{"text":"Great decor, friendly staff, the food was pretty awesome. I had the eggs Benedict and the eggs were cooked perfectly, with adequate amounts of everything. 

The ultimate disappointment was, and I hate to be one of *those* mom's, but they have an amazing brunch, and would definitely attract foodies, but they don't have high chairs, not even booster seats!!! I love food, and I love my child, but being able to eat without holding a tiny human AND trying to keep her prying hands away from my precious food is quite the feat. 

If you're going to spend time and money developing this amazing brunch menu, prepare for families to come in! We saw 2 other families with little ones so its not just me."}
{"text":"Literally just experienced the worst service in Calgary! It's such a lovely rooftop patio but the service was incredibly bad. The food itself was rather disappointing. We were only a group of three but all three were disappointed with our meals and disappointed with the appetizers. No one liked their drinks either. All in all I would never choose to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for food and drink... if there is no where else to go which is not possible on 10th. 
This place is not good because of the Bowling! We wanted to try the bowling at the National so we got there about 5pm and had dinner and got our name on a waiting list for bowling. Food and service was good upstairs! We got a call that we could get a bowling lane for 30minutes so we paid our bill quickly and headed downstairs. For the two of us to bowl for 30 minutes is was $48 dollars!! I was stunned. When our time was up, even though we only had one frame left, the lane shut down and that was it. Really not good value ... at all but a cool concept and now that I have experienced it once I do not need to experience it again."}
{"text":"Went over there for a Sunday night and we reserved two lanes for three hours.

The good: Great bowling lanes, very well taken care of. Electronic registration for games more modern than most places I have been to. They have ping pong tables and an arcade (limited on machines). You can start a tab for your evening and pay at the end. Servers kept bringing us food throughout the evening (it was a special occasion). Great serving staff. 

The bad: Dripping ceilings. It is five dollars for renting shoes, aside from paying your lane. Pizza is really greasy. There is nothing to hang your coat on around the alley.

This is s very fun place to bowl and have a nice evening. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The best styled and varied bar I have ever visited. The decor is stylish and classy. The staff are polite, focused and friendly. They have a bowling alley!! 

Ate oysters for $1 a pop and have a beer menu which is just mind boggling. I enjoyed the National and will be back for for."}
{"text":"We didn't spend a whole lot of time here, but the cocktails were pretty tasty.  Great craft beer selection too!"}
{"text":"National 10th is in the space where Whiskey Club used to be. I wasn't aware of this when I was visiting for a friend's dinner, but realized once I got there. I didn't realize there would be bouncers either - it threw me off a bit because I was expecting to have a fun, engaging dinner at a bar with friends and I got IDed at the door.

I think they actually did a decent job with the renos inside. It looked much cleaner than it did when it was Whiskey (although, I must admit that I last visited who knows how long ago). I was pleased with the separate room they had for our group, as we had reservations for a group of 8+. I was worried about the noise level when I walked in, but it was not a problem being in the separate area for groups.

The food menu did not look all that amazing - I was expecting to eat a real meal, not just munch on stuff and drink. After staring at the menu, I decided on the National chowder (clam chowder) and the 2 bite corndogs (basically mini corndogs). My boyfriend decided to order the 8 oz steak sandwich. 

We got our soup first, which we actually enjoyed a lot. We both got the small and found it a good size and filling. 

However, once we got our mains, it went downhill. I found that my corndogs were not cooked (the batter was still uncooked) and the waitress didn't come back to ask about my food until the end of the meal, when everyone else was done eating. She offered to bring me a new dish, but I declined as I didn't want to eat while everyone was finished. She offered to take it off the bill, which was kind of her. 

My boyfriend's steak sandwich was extremely plain and the quality was less than average - I could cook and season a better steak at home with salt and pepper. We didn't bother ordering dessert, as village ice cream is just a few minutes away.

Overall, we did not enjoy the food. I also doubt that I would have enjoyed the atmosphere very much, as it was extremely loud in the open areas - it would have been difficult for a group as large as us to have proper conversations. I would recommend going here if you are just going out with one other person for drinks. Plus, I found it really weird that there was a girl in the washroom talking on her cellphone the entire time.. I assume she works there and is one of those people that hand out paper towels when people are super drunk and it's busy but really...??"}
{"text":"I'm hoping that I'm giving a fair review, as all I can remember is all the fun I had while I was drunk...

National on 10th is a pretty fun place. As I'm sure you know, they have a bowling alley! You don't necessarily have to go bowling to enjoy the downstairs lounge! I found that the bar there is not as busy! I also found the music matched my tastes better downstairs! 

This isn't the cheapest place I'd go to have a drink, but it can definitely be a blast when you are with your friends."}
{"text":"Not a bar like it in Calgary! Bowling and games! Amazing! Although I wish they had more seating. It is not a place to go for food late in the evening. Place is packed by nine on the weekends."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on a Wednesday after work. We had called in advance to see if we could make a reservation for 8 but were told they do not take reservations. Fine. When we arrived around 5:30pm about half of the upstairs had reserved signs on them and was about half full...interesting. So we proceeded to go downstairs where there was more seating. The bowling alley is down there and open. Good luck getting a lane as apparently they get reserved quickly. As we sat down we were soon greeted by a waitress which was nice. The unfortunate part of the basement is that it has a totally different food and drink menu from upstairs and you could not order anything that was not on that menu (ie: a bigger selection from upstairs). this was disappointing since the food on the menu is more like snacking food. However their tacos are quite good. All in all we had a good time, but I was looking forward to trying some of the food that I had read good reviews about."}
{"text":"Really fun nice place! I found the environment was very nice, and it is a great place to get a beer. The selection is also great. My only complaint is the size of some of the dishes. The beef tacos for example where extremely small for the price paid. The tortilla size is minimal, and there are probably only 5 little pieces of meat in the taco. Great overall though!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with both the depth of interesting beers on tap and the friendly, attentive service we received on our recent visit to National on Tenth. From a broad array of Canadian craft beers to a plethora of American ones, there is something for everyone on tap. Add to that some killer deals during happy hour, and it moves up our list on where to go when in Calgary."}
{"text":"The downstairs of this place is the best.  So much fun music, bowling lanes, ping pong and a dance floor.  We had a stagette that our first location didn't work out for and this place made out night epic!!! 
The next day we actually came back for lunch and the food is delightful.  The best cesars in town for sure! 
I would suggest The National for all celebrating!!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

The National has a bowling alley as well as a bar upstairs (and a ping pong table further up). This review is strictly for the bar, as the bowling alley was closed for a private event the night I was there.

They have a very diverse menu in here, as well as daily specials. I had the clive burger, coupled with the Last Best IPA. The clive burger was very good, and I even liked the clive sauce that came with it. The IPA was decent, but man I had to get used to the higher prices for alcohol in this province...

Service was a bit disorganized as nobody came to take our order for the first 20 minutes, and we had our orders messed up a couple of occasions as well.

My friends and I also played ping pong upstairs, which was fun. However again they took a while to bring the equipment to us. Definitely something they could work on in the future."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good time here on a Saturday night. The service is a bit slow (and yes, I am taking the fact that I was there during peak time into consideration) but the beer selection is very good. The crowd is easy to get along with and there are plenty of women to look at and talk to. 

I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Bourbon Room which is on the 2nd floor of National 10th. My husband raves this place as the \"Disney Land for Bourbon drinkers\". The drink menu is just overwhelmingly massive. Check it out:

Drink menu (warning, don't open the link at work... just... don't):
http://bourbonroom.ca/wp-content/uploads/bourbon_room_menu.pdf

Their bourbon flights are pretty good, you get 3 shots per flight. My husband and I got the Blantons and Rye flights and we both agreed that the Blantons one is better.

They have so many unique mixed whiskey drinks too. The Calvados Sour has peanut butter and egg whites in it! It's weird but omg so delicious because it's creamy but not milky with just the right amount of nutty flavor. I must've ordered 3 of these that night. Also, the \"Throw yo pinky in the air, if u a true Playa\" has grappa and mead in it. That one was so harsh and gnarly, let's just say one member of our group spatted that that must be what incest tastes like.

My husband is also insisting that I add the very important fact that there are lots of naked women posters all over the walls of this lounge."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite before a concert we were attending. It was busy. There was some oyster shucking event going on with local Chefs. We enjoyed watching it unfold as we were seated at the bar.

Loved the food offerings on the menu. Not too much you are overwhelmed and some unusual suspects. Burger boy hubs ordered a big bad beef burger. It came fast and was huge. Delicious also. I went for a bowl of Duck Poutine. Just because. It left me shaking in my boots. That good. Very large also.

We washed the grub down with a cold brew. Fantastic selection of beer. Liked that. All in all we were in and out within the hour since we had a concert to get to. Service was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is Huge on the inside. Smart Business idea, scooping up all the people who used to stand up in lines on 10 Ave in the cold outside the only Bar in that block.
The beer menu is quite long, but don't rely on the Airport-like screens. They are more for display that practical use. check the menu and ask your server for beer advice.

The other neat thing about this place is the table-tennis and pool tables.
I have had pleasant experiences there."}
{"text":"Really fun!! I was here for a birthday over the weekend, and although my alcohol intake has warped my memory of the evening, I know that I really enjoyed National Bowl (located in the basement of National on 10th).

The bowling area was super clean & modern, and the shoes are REALLY nice...I legit thought about taking mine home. No stinky, gross shoes here (at least for now!). I wasn't involved with the set up of the bowling shenanigans, but everything seemed to flow smoothly and all of the staff that I interacted with were very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, National cant control their douchebag population, but I was super impressed with the facilities and the spacious, clean bathrooms. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger menu to order from, but the tacos we had were excellent and I don't even think I have to mention how well the drinks went down.

I would definitely consider having a party or birthday here in the future. However, we went upstairs after our bowling was finished and I was NOT impressed. So I'd probably just stick to the bowling area downstairs."}
{"text":"Decent place. Good for groups. Dark. Can't get a gin Caesar unless you pay $16 for a double lol."}
{"text":"This place is great, I really like the decor of the newly renovated national on 10th and i think the atmosphere is fantastic. There are a lot of professionals that come by after work for a snack and a few drinks and it really makes the evening fun. The staff are great and I enjoy the hipster-esque culture. The drinks are served in mason jars and the tables are long rows with benches. It's really quite fantastic and different than a lot of pubs in the area. The food and beverages are great, and like I said the ambiance is fun and energetic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"National, you had me at fish tacos.

National is located on 10th avenue in the SW or for some people...it's known as the old Whiskey nightclub. Parking is pay for parking across the street but there is some street parking out front if you're lucky!  They've got a bowling alley that I haven't seen yet (but will!!).  I heard it was not your ordinary old school bowling alley but a pretty sexy alley.  Also, they have a games room that is fully equipped with two table soccer games and two ping pong tables.  Apparently ping pong night is on Wednesdays.

After a few games of badminton, Jason brought me to National.  He mentioned that they had great fish tacos and I was sold.  It was about 6PM and the place was already pretty busy but luckily we grabbed a window table in the bar.  Jason ordered the Mill Street which is an organic lager 4.2% (his all time favorite) and I went with a Pimm's Cup.  Ok WOAH.  National's Pimm's Cup is the best I've had so far, if you like a gingery drink with cucumber and orange...this is the drink for you.  We then ordered fish tacos with a side of tater tots and beef sliders to share...both great finger foods.

The fish tacos were the build your own taco kind of deal.  There was a fillet of Tilapia (I think), some guacamole, chips, pico de gallo, cabbage, some sort of delicious sauce and of course the tortilla.  I really enjoyed these, especially because the fish is grill, not fried.  On to the tater tots, they came with franks hot sauce and a ranch dip.  Dipping the tater tot in the ranch then in frank's.....mouth watering!!  I enjoyed the tater tots so much, Jason was asking me if there were any left for him.  Now for the beef sliders, nothing spectacular, just your typical sliders.....lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, sauce.  Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad! Just nothing much compared to the fish tacos ;)

Before ordering our meals, we actually decided that we were going to try the deep fried mars bar for dessert so that got me excited. I LOVE SWEETS.  We ordered one to share and it came with ice cream, a side of melted ice cream? and four mini fried mars bars that looked like mini corn dogs haha.  They were...interesting.  I took a bite of one and the caramel was oozing.  It was good but I dont think I will order it again, something to try for sure though.  Service was decent, nothing over the top great.  Our server was there to fill our waters and take plates away but not as attentive as I would have liked.

Overall, we left pretty satisfied!  National is a great place to hang out with your friends and have some fun!  I love their idea of incorporating the games room and bowling alley... it's a total adult playground in the beltline. Oh! Just so you know minors are able to dine here but not after 9PM!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and wonderful rooftop patio. The inside is pretty cool and well finished. Definitely worth seeing even for a brunch on the weekend. I was pleased to see it was an improvement over its former self The Whiskey."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about this location is that they have underground bowling. The first and only time I have been there the server was rude and food was not great. My friend ordered a Caesar salad, which at most locations don't include anchovies. Although it's the traditional way of making the salad,  the menu did not disclose that information, so when my friend got the salad, she asked the server if she could change her order. The server was rude, and spoke to the entire table like we were idiots and should have known. After all of that we were still charged for the salad that wasn't even touched, then we had to ask to speak to the manager, and after explaining the situation, we STILL had to argue about paying for a dish that wasn't what my friend wanted, nor had any of it been eaten.  I would only ever return to this location to bowl. Poor service."}
{"text":"It's a drunk fest and they don't have much selection on tap. I prefer craft for their selection and atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could choose zero stars, I would! This waitress Lindsay was horrible with a lot of attitude, and the Manager Josh did not side on the customer. Our fries tasted like bleach, we asked him to try one and he said he would get the kitchen staff to try the fries and that's not what you do  as a manager. This experience could have been rectified by the manager, but of course he told the person complaining they are banned for life. Horrible professionalism."}
{"text":"Great bar with super fun ambience!! The food is actually better than most bars! All snacks are good, and the tacos are my favourites! They also have the bowling in the basement that is really fun!! Wine is ok... not terrible like most bars, but not super good either... service is not bad ... nothing to complain..."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to be treated rudely. This is a crappy Calgary bar that is full of post high school yuppies... security this is not Rikers Island. Relax a tad."}
{"text":"Great caesars, their brunch is also very good. The bowling alley is fun with a group unfortunately it's quite expensive. Great for big groups, and it gets very busy on Friday/Saturday nights. Service is usually fast and attentive! Love that it's such a big location with fun games as well as a bourbon room. Will be back for hangover brunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and thought we got there early because we were told it was only an hour wait until bowling. After an hour we asked and it was still over an hour wait. Left because they seemed to be taking advantage of their patrons. The bar was empty when we arrived and somehow people jumped us in line. Do not recommend if having a special occasion where your place in line is respected."}
{"text":"This past weekend while visiting friends in Calgary, we met up at National on 10th. I was only there for the entertainment component so I won't be commenting on the food or menu.
  I arrived too late to partake in the foosball,  which they had turned into a drinking game, so probably best I missed it anyways as I didn't need anymore than I found to consume!  I did however arrive in time for the bowling :)  The amount of activities you can find to amuse yourself within this place is quite amazing! The upstairs had more of a dance vibe while the basement bowling lounge was more chill. 
 I loved the picnic table seating as it was a quick and fun way to meet other people and offered a feeling of a beerfest, and speaking of beers, there were plenty to choose from. I myself prefer a darker beer, ales, stouts or porters, our waitress took the time to let me know what they had and what I might like from their selections and i was happy with the few I had. 
  There was a pretty big line up when I arrived, but I took the bold move of going straight to the front and mentioning I was meeting friends who were bowling and they let me right in.  Which in turn had the people who had been waiting all saying they were just there to bowl as well, and if there were other yelpers in the line up it may have lowered their star rating if they were unhappy with the fact that i got to skip the line up.. but I was grateful :)
  I will definitely be heading back there to try out more of their activities, possibly the menu, but for sure for the beer and the bowling !"}
{"text":"Large, spacious, with its signature \"big pub\" design - full of uncomfortable furniture and wood panels mixed with cheaper materials... National is a solid chain, and this location is a good one. Roof patio leaves a bit to be desired, but still useful. And rest of the place is very suitable for large adult parties.

Food is okay - not like gourmet, but solid and well made stuff. Unfortunately, with snacks downplayed to cheaper ingredients. It is not really fun to go for a professional kitchen and get very average stuff looking like it came from nearby superstore. But - there are good main plates to choose from, and bar menu is decent.

Overall, a reasonably decent downtown location - not something to be craved, but neither something to be neglected."}
{"text":"I have been to NTNL10 many times since it opened, not since the new bowling alley however.

They have unique menu items, especially for people who love snacking.  I have had their charcuterie board, and it is generous and delicious.   

I love all the beers on tap and the vibe.   I'd recommend anytime."}
{"text":"I went to National on 10th with a group of friends for a 40th birthday. We got there in the afternoon and had no trouble finding a table. We were greeted by a very nice server who offered us pints from their seemingly infinite beer list! I ordered the pork-belly BLT which was really good, but the best part of the meal was the spare rib appetizer. We ordered 2 for the table of 10 to split and we ended up ordering 2 more they were so good! We played some games (ping pong and foosball) and then went bowling downstairs! By the time we were done bowling, it was almost 11 and the bar upstairs was very busy. When I was 30 I probably would've stayed and had a great time, but we decided to call it a night there and left. All in all a good experience!"}
