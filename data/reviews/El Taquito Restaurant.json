{"text":"This place is foul. My husband and i decided to try it out since there had been a lot of fuss on FB of how good it was and we were extremely disappointed. I at the time was 7 months pregnant so i ordered a pineapple water and my husband a \"michelada\" (red beer) and they were ok. Next came of course the chips & salsa.. and there was a GUM! YES ! A CHEWED UP GUM THAT HAD BEEN IN SOMEONES MOUTH IN OUR CHIPS ! I was disgusted !!! I couldn't beleive it ! I thought it was a piece i cheese or something, so i made him grab it and make sure what it was. Sure enough, it was a big 'ol white sticky clay like gum, ugh ! i get mad just thinking about it. Needless to say we walked out without paying a dime or a tip. NEVER went back again, my daughter is now 11 months old and we always pas and never does it cross my mind walking in there. If there was a gum that ended up in our food what else could there be in there? Animals? Under what supervision do they work? where's the health department in these situations !? They got lucky my husband didn't let me snap a picture, i was furious."}
{"text":"Sunday buffet has menudo,  posole, taquitos fritos, chicken pipian,  Chiles rellenos, rice and bean,  scrambled eggs with hot dog wieners,  and assorted fruit.  The food quality is just ok at the buffet,  I think I needed air-conditioning,  it was hot.  Maybe next time I'll order from the menu,  maybe that's an improvement. 

The restaurant is the typical Mexican restaurant in the hood with the blaring music and TV on telemundo and Univision.  Weekend mornings are frequented by hungover people looking for the hungover cure in a spicy menudo and micheladas(spicy red beer). 

Oh and even though the restaurant is Mexican the cooks are Salvadoran."}
{"text":"Great food, I love their michelas always made to perfection and tacos governador are delicious..great customer service and although the food may take a little more than usual but it is definitely made to perfection and I love to visit."}
{"text":"This place is closed down what's really messed up is I just printed coupon from restaurant.com to come to this place yesterday only to find out they been closed for a while so not only do they no longer exists at this location but they never bothered to take their promotion off of the internet"}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas...this is definitely a legit Mexican restaurant. The food is great and so are the micheladas, but there can be a few drunks. As long as they mind their business at their table it's all good!"}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review on this place already - but here we go.

I love a mexican restaurant full of well...Mexicans!!!  This place has no atmosphere and it is very plain inside.  But when the food is good who cares.

Another good sign about this place is the menus are written in spanish.  That is a good indicator this place is authentic.  The food was a great value huge plates at affordable prices.  Authentic dishes- everything tasted excellent.

Here is why you need to go here - \"homemade corn tortillas!\"  They are amazing!

When you are on the east side stop by!"}
