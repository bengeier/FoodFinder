{"text":"The beef bimbibop was really really good! I also enjoyed the small free table appetizers, it was a tasty treat before the food came. The food was prepared quickly, but the cans of soda for $2 each was not cool, and because it is so small they have like 2 servers, so keep that in mind if you want attention and quick service. My wife had the dish in the stone bowl and hated it, as did her mom. The potstickers and sushi rolls were excellent! If you go for the food I'd give it 4 stars, but you have to be forgiving of the decor and service..."}
{"text":"Let me just get this out of the way:  I've been going to this restaurant for years and received some of the WORST service I've ever experienced.   The last time I ate at this place, everything went wrong...but I won't go into details.  It is a true testament to the food that I'll be going back, again, and again, and again.  My favorite meal is the pork bulgogi, which is amazingly tender and has just the right amount of char that carmelizes the flavorful marinade.  Be sure to ask for it with spicy sauce.  The seafood soup is also very good.  The little dishes with kimchi and sweet potato that come with your meal are a real treat."}
{"text":"A real mom & pop Korean restaurant.  Good panchan, and an extensive selection of down-home Korean dishes.  The prices may seem a bit high when compared to the decor, but here you're paying for the quality of the food, not the ambiance.  And in my book, taste beats ambiance any day.   I recently tried the Bibim Nang Myun, a cold buckwheat noodle dish.  It sounded intriguing, and just the thing to hit the spot on a hot June evening.  The \"broth\" was served as frozen flakes shaved over the top of the noodles, which was cool just in itself.  The owner came over to talk to me about the meal, & I learned that it was really a traditional winter dish -- the cold soup used to balance the cold outdoors apparently.  But also where (and when) else could you freeze your broth back in the days before freezers, anyway?"}
{"text":"I love their chicken sooooo much it's nice and spicy. But I remember the last time I went there the chicken seemed to be chewy and dry. But that was the first time it happened to me. I love the place so I just turn the cheek since it was the first time that happened. I love the kimchi soup and the bulgogi. One of the side dish made me crazy and if the only sold the potato with that delicious sauce I would definitely buy it. Overall I love the restaurant. I definitely recommend going there with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great tasting food at reasonable prices, and generous portions. I've never left here broke, hungry, or disappointed, and there aren't a lot of Madison restaurants I can say that about. My Korean friends always want to go here when they come to Madison. The last time I came here was with a friend who is a very picky eater and we managed to find something on the menu that she liked.  As for the people who say the service is bad, maybe they are high maintenance people who need to be catered to a lot. I've always had adequate, no-nonsense service here. It can be a little slow when the place is busy, but the place is busy for a reason- it's good!  I wouldn't really want to come here in very hot weather because the air conditioning doesn't keep up with all the meals that come with table side burners, but other than that I can't think of anything negative to say about the place."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy décor wise, but truly hits the spot.  Loved the bibimbop.  But what's not to love about egg on top of anything?  Am thinking I hit the mother lode in restaurants within walking distance of my new pad!"}
{"text":"I'm not in the know about Korean food, but everything I've had here is yummy and tastes fresh (as in, homemade - which almost most of it is!). I've been to one other Korean restaurant in my life, the sort run by a family that loved the place and it showed, and when compared to them, it's decently almost as good.  If you want something fresher (less greasy, less fried) than your typical Chinese-American food, then definitely try it out. Bulgogi is good, my friend is addicted to their Bibimbap, I've had a few delicious soups (Tofu, Tukmandu, Oxtail), and I am absolutely addicted to their kimchi, haha. It's not cheap but I think it's worth a try (and then if you like it, you'll be back and the price won't seem so bad)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The food is diverse enough to suit many taste preferences. The bibimbop is a great, balanced meal with fresh ingredients. The kitchen is not super fast, but it is because they prepare the food fresh. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. Good spot for large groups, too."}
{"text":"Wonderful Korean food. We went there late but the guys was really welcoming us and did his best to accommodate us whatever we need. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"DO NOT eat here. Worst service I have ever received in my life (watch out for the guy with the glasses). I tipped lower (8%ish) due to his service and he got angry and threw the money at my face. I ate there the second time and he forced me to raise my tip to 15%. What a douchy service."}
{"text":"The place was small so we had to squished into a table with other customers sitting literally next to us. The service was slow! Only one guy to take care of everyone. The food came out in about a hour and was very hot which is good and bad... The good is that we know it was freshly made and the bad..we couldnt eat the food until it went cold. We ordered the jambong btw which was about $12. The description says this is a flour noodle soup but all we got was udon noodles with cabbage in a seafood broth. The menu prices is decent if you're willing to pay $30 for one meat dish and about $12 for every other dish. The side dishes (kimchi, caramelized potatoes, and pickled radish) are not something you should eat cause the caramelized potatoes should be sweet which it wasn't it was just pan fried potatoes! Will only come to this place again if I was dying for korean food since this restaurant isnt expensive like the other korean restaurant KPeppers."}
{"text":"I was visiting Wisconsin and craving Korean food towards the end of my trip, which lead me to this restaurant. My impression of the decor was that it was very minimal, but there were some historic Korean knick-knacks. There was only 1 person working trying to seat, take orders, serve, and ring up the bill. He was super nice and greeted us immediately.   As for the food...we got ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes), kimchi fried rice, and yukgaeyang (a spicy beef soup). There was a lack of side dishes that Korean restaurants are known for and the ones that came out were unimpressive (kimchi, fried sweet potatoes, and pickled radish). The ddukbokki was too mushy/overcooked and lacked the spicy taste that I was craving. I enjoyed the kimchi fried rice and the portion size was big. The yukgaeyang was decent. However, the food came out fast and the service was great.   Compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to back home this place ranks low but seeing how this is one of two Korean restaurants in Madison it does the job if you're in the mood for Korean."}
{"text":"Was excited to try out this place, because I love Korean food and didn't realize Madison would have a decent Korean restaurant. Got the tukbokgi, which was pretty good, but the rice cakes were a little too big for my taste. The beef bulgogi was only four thin pieces for over $13 - definitely not worth it. The soft tofu soup was a good amount, but the flavor was only mediocre, and there was barely any of the seafood that was stated on the menu. The galbitang was delicious, however, and the beef was so tender and yummy."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to this place is because it's the nearest Korean restaurant to Madison college campus.  I always go for their Bibimbap on Rock which is the best meal there, in my opinion.  The potato side is really good too!!"}
{"text":"tipping issue. the manager claims to raise tip with inappropriate phrases.   Regarding to the reviews, it was not only me went through the same issue. Be aware of the glasses wearing server/manager.   Food quality also does not meet the price. Highly not recommended to visit. Hope no one faces the same circumstances anymore."}
{"text":"The best Korean food outside of Korea and CA that you can find. Excellent cuisine, fast service, affordable pricing. Authentic! Love it. Go here all the time."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Korean food we found in Madison.  Bugolgi, Bimbibop and ox tail soup are super delicious.  It's always busy when we eat here and it is pretty authentic Korean food!"}
{"text":"If you wanna w8 for 20 minutes to order you food and w8 another 20 minutes to get ur food on table, go for it. The most ridiculous part is that the guy with glass does not consider the w8ing time as his fault, but he thinks that you should be supposed to w8 the whole 40 minutes for ur food without any complains, and then give him a 15% tips.  We went there today and gave 10% tips, and that guy got mad and request us to raise tips. I told him the w8ing time is so long and he barely served us, so I have the right to decide the tip amount. I told him that he should hire a waiter since he is the only person who serves every table. Then, he got angry and he told us it's our duty to w8 and being ignored and if we don't want to w8 we don't need to come(which we really wouldn't come again). BEST DINING LESSON TILL SO FAR, thank you!  Also, all CHINESE people, just DONT go there. After we stated our reason for the low tip, he turned to super annoy and began to upbraid. I didn't clearly hear all of it, for one reason he is having strongly Korean accent like\"visa, masda and disgover, no ameligan expless(and no please at the end), and he didn't even bother to come in front of our table to pass our bill but to pass it across the counter. However, in the end I clearly caught that \"yeah I knew you are chinese, all chinese people doing that\". Come on dude, 15% tips is just one dollar than 10%, it's just nothing but showing our attitude, where's ur manners?   Chinese food tastes way better than the Korean food in Madison. Go Chicago for better Korean food and HIGHER serving quality."}
{"text":"New Seoul marked my second visit to a Korean restaurant in Madison (Coreana was the first).  Compared to Coreana, New Seoul is located in much more modest surroundings with clean but plain decor.  I came to New Seoul for lunch over the Thanksgiving weekend and ordered the kimchi soup.  Marked in the menu as spicy, the soup definitely had kick, but more so because of the high temperature of the stone bowl.  Accompanying the soup were small plates of kim chi, potato, and other side dishes.  The soup was done well and would be a great order for anyone wanting something vegetarian.  Most meals on the lunch special were $5-7--a pretty good deal for Korean cuisine.  Service was very good and attentive--it appears to be a family-run restaurant, with the husband and wife working in the front of the restaurant.  I saw a lot of Korean customers which was a good sign of the food's appeal.  Compared to Coreana, I'd probably elevate New Seoul to 3.5 in terms of food, but a bit lower for ambience and decor.  I'm hoping to go back to New Seoul to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my top choice for lunch in Madison! Lived and worked near original location for 7 years and am happy to travel 300 miles to enjoy this great place now that I have moved out of town (where I have a ton of Korean options but nothing comes close to New Seoul!). Friendly staff, great prices, delicious rock cooker bibimbop."}
{"text":"I like the food very much. But the space is a bit too small."}
{"text":"On a freezing cold January day, still feeling the tail end of a migraine, I needed a little comfort food. Debated my Asian food options on the west side and went for New Seoul - my first visit. It hit the spot exactly.   The place was packed when we got there at late lunch time. We were sort of baffled by the number of student-age people there - until we realized it was MLK Day and no school that day. There was a small wait for a table, but the gentleman working the front of the house acknowledged us right away and cleared a table as soon as it was available.  Given how packed the place was, I was very impressed with the quick and attentive service. We were treated to banchan right away (kimchi, daikon and sweet potatoes), which made a great first impression. All three were delicious and took the edge off our hunger a bit.  Between my companion and I, we ordered the fried dumplings, seasoned deep-fried chicken (which came with rice), and rock bowl bibimbop. All were good, but the chicken really stood out. It had just the right spice to warm a frigid afternoon. I would absolutely order this again.  The rock bowl bibimbop heated things up in other ways - the stone bowl kept the food hot until we packed up the leftovers. The bibimbop was tasty, but not as tasty as I would have hoped. It needed something - but I'm at a loss to say what. I kept adding the hot sauce that was brought on the side, but it didn't really add any flavor. The beef in the dish was perfectly seasoned, but it just wasn't enough to carry the flavor throughout the dish. The egg that topped it was perfect, though - lightly cooked with a perfectly runny yolk.  I look forward to trying more of the New Seoul menu - and am always happy to find good, locally owned options on the far west side of Madison."}
{"text":"New Seoul is my favorite Korean restaurant in Madison.  I've tried the others and they do not compare to the authenticity of this place.  The only complaint i have ever had is that some dishes are too spicy for me."}
{"text":"I went down to New Seoul over the weekend. This was the very first Korean place I have ever been to. I had the deep fried chicken. It was one of the very best I have ever had. The service was very prompt too. The one complaint that I have is the place was a bit small. So there is very little space when you need to go to your table. Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I will surely be going back to New Seoul."}
{"text":"This is the same New Seoul that used to be location by the University.  The food here is really good, but the service could be better.  Its not exactly their fault.  Their server is as attentive as he could be. The problem is that he was the only server here at time.  No matter, he does his best and he is really nice.  Id definitely recommend the chicken bulgogi and the pork bokum. The pork is spicy and flavorful, and the chicken is super tender. The quality of their ingredients and flavors are quite great, which keeps me coming back hehe. And unlimited small side dishes woohoo! If you ever need more flavor or spice, ask for their spicy sauce :)"}
{"text":"I love everything about Korean food and I find myself craving New Seoul pretty frequently.   Some favorites are the Rock Cooker Bibimbap with pork, the Bulgogi with beef, the Kim Bap and of course the wonderful assortment of Kim Chee served with every meal.   The decor may not be fancy (it is CLEAN) but that literally means nothing to me if the food and service is good, which it is.   Best Korean in Madison, this is where I go for comfort food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Korean. I took the kalbi while my wife had the bibbimbap which was quite nice. The food was really good and so was the service. Would definitely be going back."}
{"text":"As close to authentic Korean as you can get in Madison. They do several dishes really well, especially homey Korean staples such as the bimbimbop (make sure to get it in the hot stone bowl), bulgogi, Doenjang-jjigae (fermented soybean paste stews), dubbokki (gluttonous rice cakes and fish cake in chili paste), and Gimbop (Korean sushi rolls).  The best part is that their banchan are free!   This is our first choice for Korean.   Closed on Sundays. Be prepared to wait during peak dining hours, the space is small and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm excited to have found an authentic Korean restaurant in Madison!  We came in on a Saturday night, and every single table was full, which was also a good sign.    We waited about ten minutes for a table, and then received our banchan.  I wish they had more, but the potatoes were yummy and the kimchi was also solid, not too acidic and the right amount of flavorful.  For starters, we had the dukbokki and the kimbap.  The dukbokki was hot, had a little kick of spicy, and the sweetness wasn't overdone. As for the kimbap, I really enjoyed the consistency of the rice and how warm it was, a super satisfying dish.  For mains, the seafood jungol was a little bland for me; it was a lot of spicy but lacked salt. The beef bulgogi was extremely tender and one of the stars of the meal. The jambong was the perfect hot soup for a cold winter day; it was like a more flavorful jungol that was slightly less salty with noodles that were kind of like udon, but slightly thinner.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  I loved that this place felt like a local, family-run restaurant that wasn't trying to impress with flashy atmosphere, but rather a home cooked and hearty meal."}
{"text":"Loved it! Very delicious. My co-worker brought me here yesterday. I came back today with my husband. We ordered the korean pancake and rock cooker bibinpop."}
{"text":"I've been a Korean food lover for 3 decades now, both here and abroad. I default to New Seoul Restaurant for consistently authentic Korean standards. The ambiance and decor is informal and simple, but it's comfortable. The traditional Korean sides are ample and very tasty and the menu selections are extensive -- good reasons why many Korean natives regularly frequent New Seoul. I strongly recommend this restaurant if you want the real thing in Madison."}
{"text":"I hold back one star for ambiance and for the bathroom. The restaurant and bathroom are very clean but just screaming for some remodeling and fresh paint.  I stopped in for lunch and was chilled to the bone. I decided to order the Bimbibop. I chose to have the beef based on the recommendation of the owner. I also had ginger tea. The tea had a strong ginger flavor and matchsticks of fresh ginger sat in the bottom of the teacup. The tea was a bit overly sweet but I still enjoyed it.  I ordered my meal to be cooked in the rock cooker. The rice on the bottom gets very crispy and the dish stays hot for a long time after serving. You eat right from the stone. There was rice, spinach, bean shoots and other veggies along with the delicious beef, cooked with with lovely Korean spices. Everything is topped with a fried egg. I loved watching the yolk slowly drip and spread over my steaming hot meal. Very sensuous and inviting. Also on the table was a squeeze bottle of Korean BBQ sauce, which I used heartily.   The dish was accompanied by pickled daikon radish, sweet potatoes (white potatoes roasted with a sugar glaze) and kimchi. The kimchi could have been hotter. I like spice!  I arrived around 1:30 and there were two tables of Asians and then little ol' me. The owner was very friendly and helpful. My food came quickly as did my check.  I will be back soon. Great place for a cold winter evening."}
{"text":"Our party of 2 ordered the spring rolls, beef and chicken BIBIMBAP...the spring rolls were wonderful ..the BIBIMBAP was good and fairly priced  ..the food didn't seem to be as fresh as other places and the hot sauce had little flavor ...atmosphere and service great however it did leave me craving for more from my favorite Korean spot :/"}
{"text":"The place was great for a quick bite. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious we had bulgogi and bibimbop."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of New Seoul since I moved to Madison.   The bibimbop is very good. The pulgogi is also very good, but could be cut up a bit more before serving. The portions are a bit large for chop sticks.  The kimchi is very good! I am not a huge fan of the various stir-fry dishes they offer. I had the chopchebop once and have never had it again since. The other stir-fry dishes are OK, but I'm a fan of the bibimbop and will probably only ever order that again.   The atmosphere of the restaurant leaves something to be desired. The bathroom is often dirty and awkward to get to. The service is usually good, but sometimes the turn-over of the staff seems a bit high and the quality of service suffers. All in all, it's a good place and not too pricey."}
{"text":"Had lunch at New Seoul today and was thrilled! They have a lunch menu, all entrees are $7.99. I work in the area and you're going to spend at least that much at Panera or Chipotle, so why not break for the usual and support a local place.  I ordered the veggie chop chae bop, which is clear sweet potato noodles, cabbage, carrot, onion, green onion, mushroom, red cabbage. It was wonderful. Definitely enough food to share or save leftovers. It came with a small side of kimchi (delicious) and I asked for a side of the red chili sauce that is usually on the table (my food was to go). I added a veggie egg roll, which was delicious, but not necessary. The egg roll was freshly made, and a triangle rather than rolled.   I've eaten here a number of times and am surprised to see that others were unhappy. I eat Korean food often in different cities and at other Korean restaurants in Madison, and time and again New Seoul is the best.   My favorites (some only available on the dinner menu, but you are free to order them at lunch) are kimbop, tukbokgi, vegetable bokum, and the stone bowl bibimbop. Their miso soup is fantastic as well. I'm trying to branch out, the chop chae bop has now made the list. If you eat there the banchan are included and delicious."}
{"text":"The service is great.  They were attentive and my order came out in a timely manner.    I ordered the Tofu Soup which was seafood flavored and came with white rice.  It wasn't the best Korean tofu soup I've had, but it hit the spot when you've been in Madison for some months without Korean food.  Good serving size too.  The roommate got Bibimbop, which was tasty but slighty too dry.  The appetizers were a disappointment.  The potatoes were just oil and sugar, I think.  The kimchi wasn't spicy enough.  There were no fried fish or pancakes.    I'd go back for the soup."}
{"text":"The style is home-cooked, and the food is consistently tasty in that sense. The banchan (side dishes) have a pretty stable rotation: the nappa cabbage, cubed radish, shredded radish, and sweet fried potato.   If you order the grilled meats, e.g. bulgogi, don't expect the whole spread of lettuce wraps and garnishes - it's more American style, where you have a piece of meat on a plate and a knife and fork. I would recommend ordering family style here, though it seems to be common among regular diners to order your own dish.  The chapchae, kimbap, bibimbap, and bokums are good - I've tried all of them. I also recommend the casseroles and soups, but you may want to be pickier with those. Helpfully, the menu will list the ingredients.   They are closed Sundays and I recommend going earlier or later than usual to avoid the dinner rush. It's not usually a bustling atmosphere, but when their seating area is full, their limited staff - I've seen the same three people the dozen or so times I've been here - might struggle to keep up."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I stopped in to order takeout. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers--the decor is very simple. But we did have good, quick service. As a testament to the authenticity of the food, I tend to think it's a good sign when people of the same ethnicity are patrons of a restaurant, and this was certainly the case.  I had the bibimbop, and was pleased. It was of high quality, and the beef was tasty.  I fell in love with Korean BBQ, especially galbi, in Chicago... Has anyone had it here? It's one of the most expensive dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"The worst korean food I've ever had... They didn't even try to make it like 'real food'. Overall, the food tastes like shit and service sucks. I know some people like this place and left good reviews, and that's why I decided to have it a try. But, really, I got so angry for such shitty food. Never got such angry in a restaurant! I will never recommend you to come, but if you really wanna get it a try, DO NOT order seafood vegetable bokkem!"}
{"text":"I rank this as A-OK because I've definitely had better, but on a scale of what is available in Madison, this place is probably the closest you're going to get to authentic. I like the area that it is in and it definitely reminds me of home. They have a good selection of Korean dishes, but i will note they are on the pricey side. What you get to do when you're pretty much the only Korean restaurant. I was in a super craving for dobbokki so i when i visited i walked in and ordered it right away with a side of seaweed soup. What is great about this place is that the side dishes come out first, as usual, for no charge. It definitely held me over since i was starved.   The dobbokki was good. Not amazing or excellent but good. it satisfied my craving and had an abundance of the rice cakes and fish cake. It could have been a bit more spicy and i feel like the sauce was a little sweeter than i'm used to. the main critique is that the rice cakes themselves were overcooked and a little mushy.   The seaweed soup hit home. It has beef in it so be aware! But you can't go wrong with seaweed soup.    The restaurant was packed for saturday lunch so i was happy to get a table and served very quickly. I will be back to try their tofu soup (soondobu/cheege). But that'll be another time. Til then!   Happy findings!!"}
{"text":"Madison is in dire need of a some good Korean food. There is only one Korean restaurant in all of Madison (two if you count the one in Middleton) and that is not enough.   At New Seoul, you'll find the simple staple items such as mandu, bibimbap, and bulgolgi. I think the most exquisite food you'll find is probably the kalbi tang and oxtail soup. Hence, it's a pretty unoriginal menu with no bbq dishes or soondooboo (tofu stone bowl) specialties.   Growing up close to NYC and spending my college years near Chicago has really helped broaden my horizons regarding Korean food. There's a lot of better options elsewhere and the New Seoul dishes are sub par. Nonetheless, if you're craving for some Korean food and you don't want to take a two hour car drive or purchase a plane ticket, you'll find the basic Korean items served at New Seoul. Who knows? If you're craving it enough, you might even think the food here is decent."}
{"text":"Do you like hole in the walls?  How about angry owner/wife hollering at kitchen staff while wearing a perma-scowl (BTW, the owner/husband is very quiet and kind)?   The best and most authentic Korean food in the Madison area.  We have been here a number of times.  We are not connoisseurs of Korean food, but we love good food and notice a high volume of Korean clientele in the restaurant.  We do not come for ambiance, modern/consistently kind service or creative fare/fusion dishes.  We love time-tested staples.    We stick with more of the \"pedestrian dishes\" like bulgogi and bibimbap (always use the stone bowl!). Prior to those dishes you get free appetizers including kimchi and potato stuff and other root vegetables or whatever -- it's all delicious, well-prepared/seasoned and fresh.  If you come in here with similar expectations to mine, this place is fantastic and results in a lot of return visits. The only reason there is no five star here because none of the dishes are blow-your-mind amaze-balls."}
{"text":"New Seoul's food is sub par, we go there only when we really really crave for Korean dishes. I understand it serves home style cooking, nothing fancy, but they could be a lot better. The service, as mentioned in many reviews, is consistently below average as well.   It is a puzzle to me that, given all the cultural diversity, Madison really lacks good Korean food. K pepper in Middleton is just overpriced. I waited for an hour for my food at Sol's on the Square on its opening day, and have yet to find a good reason to give them a second chance.   3 stars only because it is the only few Korean restaurants in Madison. Would be 2 stars in cities with more Korean food selection. It will be easily driven out of business with some real competition."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week.  This is my first Korean restaurant experience in my 5 year Madison life.  Usually Korean restaurants are overpriced than other restaurants especially in small cities.  I ordered 14 dollar Pork bulgogi which is the most expensive pork bulgogi in my life.  I do not have a picture but if you browse the restaurant pictures, one can be found.  What I  got was nice cold dish with the 3 pieces of flattened meat.    First, Korean bbq is not a cold dish.  They should be served in hot sizzling condition.  Second, I have never seen that weird shaped pork bulgogi in Korea and US combined.  It is like I ordered a spaghetti and I was served three huge lasagna in spaghetti sauce.  How to cut ingredients really matters in Cooking.    All I can say is, please beware."}
{"text":"No it's not up to par for Seoul, LA, New York, or even Chicago. But it's here, it's Korean food and I appreciate it."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian bibimbap. I am not sure but it seemed kinda plain to me but I have not had much korean food to compare it to. Is it supposed to have a sauce?The seating is very cramped and some of the seating is strange like next to where people stand in line but the service is friendly and fast. Prices are fair. I may try it again and see if it appeals to me more."}
{"text":"Who gives a damn about the interior? It's my stomach's interior I care about, and my stomach is happy when I eat here. Does Madison have a preponderance of Korean options? Nope. But does it matter when I can eat at New Seoul? Not really."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about Korean food but I thought the food was good. I like squid and I thought they cooked it nicely, not too rubbery. The service was great although our food did not come out all together.  The dining room was just ok. Clean but plain."}
{"text":"Korean food is not your typical ethnic restaurant in the Midwest, although there are a few in some of the larger cities.  Fortunately Madison has New Seoul.  New Seoul is a small space in a strip mall full of restarants.  Service was fine, and the food was prepared quickly and well.  You know its real because of all the Koreans who eat there.  Overall, an excellent find and a real treat to try something not often found in the midwest."}
{"text":"Nice little place for a few Korean dishes, I'm not expert but I can always find a couple of things on the menu. It's kind of small, and family owned so they can get overwhelmed yet there are many many worse places one could choose."}
{"text":"This is by far the most authentic Korean restaurant in the area. You want decor and Americanized Korean, go to K Peppers in Middleton, it's delicious and employs english speaking UW students. New Seoul has a lot of nostalgia for me because my mom and dad used to take me here as a young child. The owners still recognize me from time to time whenever I end up there.  If you think the bulgogi is expensive for what it is, get the galbi. Better quality meat and no rice just the ribs. Totally a bang for your buck.  The galbi tang and the kimchi jigae is worth having here soup wise. They make great mandu...errr dumplings, gyoza... they all come from Asia get the hell over it. I hear the dolsot bibimbap is great but I haven't tried it myself. Come in with a smile and the servers will reciprocate.   The entrance looks kind of shady but once you creep through the hallway that you're sure leads to a korean crack den you realize is actually leads to a restaurant. Expect to spend between 8 to 18 bucks depending on what you get."}
{"text":"This place is low on the list of korean places i've eaten at.  I am not going to say anything douchey like \"I lived in Korea...\" etc, because I haven't but I think this place can do better.  Korean places run the gamut from kinda dumpy to nice, but I've found with Korean food especially, the best food can come from the most hole-in-the-wall kind of place.  Service was good and fast, but the Kimchi seemed old and overly soggy.  The bulgogi was a poor excuse for bulgolgi and seemed just like beef shank.    Overall, it satisfied my korean craving but left me wanting a whole lot more."}
{"text":"You can claim best Korean in Madison because there are pretty much next to no excellent Korean restaurants in Madison. The side dishes were good, miso soup okay, your standard kimchi, sweet potato, and radish, the kimbap was better than everything else I ate after that. The bimbimbap everyone talked so great about wasn't that good. I'm sorry but the rest of you need to get your taste buds checked. The majority of the food was bland and unflavorful. The squid dish was pretty much squid with chili on it.  Overall I was disappointed with all the glowing reviews. I'm still looking for an awesome Korean place that serves spicy tofu soup where I can drop a fresh egg into it while it's still boiling hot with a great variety of banchan side dishes. Maybe Chicago will be my next stop if I want to eat Korean food again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food, great service, though kinda odd and small interior. We enjoyed the kimchi, radishes and potato appetizers and loved our entree. Huge portions at reasonable prices. We definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Everything was hot and delicious...pork won tons, the chicken stir fries were Amazon's and beef was great. Fresh and great spices. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food! Nice service and friendly staff~ Close to campus and fair price. If u like Korean food, definitely check out!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There's three Korean restaurants in Madison, and I'm loyal to this one.    I don't have a TON of experience with Korean food, though I have had home cooked Korean food, and have tried restaurants in Koreatowns.  For what I like to eat, I find this to be pretty good, but there are some other dishes I've tried (like the japchae) that I don't think are very good.  I pretty much stick with the bibimbap - it's a safe bet.  Their menu, however, is not very extensive and pretty basic.  I still prefer this over the one in Middleton (I find their food to be abnormally greasy), and Sol's (fine food but smaller portions for the same price, BUT more variety).  The service is decent, though I have had some strange experiences there that I'll just chalk up to cultural differences.  My only tip is that if you like spicy food, you have to specifically ask them to make it spicy.  Lots of people (wrongly, I think) claim that Korean cuisine is very spicy, but I don't find that to be the case, so if you like a little more kick you'll have to ask for it."}
{"text":"We ordered the kimchi-soup, galbi and tukmandu. Everything we ordered was pretty good. The galbi was marinated right and the portions are very good. The staff was very friendly. But I was disappointed  the only option for the soondubu (tofu soup) seafood and wasn't able to make it vegetarian or without the seafood? Most Korean restaurants have that option. I thought that was pretty strange and the banchan options could have been better (only had three). Other than those concerns, I would have to say it was a good meal and I'll come back again."}
{"text":"This is the new location for New Seoul.  Same owner. Same mediocre service. Same BEST KOREAN IN MADISON.    The new location is smaller than their former residence.  The decor will hopefully come. Their new place definitely lacks ambiance.  I loved the dirty dinginess of the old spot. It reminded me of Korea and yelling my order to the adjumma in the kitchen.    The stone bowl bi bim bop (dol sot bi bim bop) is the best in Madsion. I love letting the dish sit there for a good couple of minutes and letting the rice crisp up before i dig in. YUM. My girlfriend always get the bulgogi. She's addicted.    So the food is good but the service is under par.  They forgot the miso soup that comes with the bulgogi, They also served the meal without providing utensils. It wasnt the speediest stop either.    If you have a hunkering for authentic takboki, galbi, or bi bim bop look no further than New Seoul"}
{"text":"If you craving Korean food this is the place to go! The food is delicious the owners are so friendly, fast service, neat and organized. What else could you ask for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOT on University Ave in Madison anymore as we discovered on a cold night craving spicy soup. New Seoul has moved to a different location. 721 N High Point Rd., Middleton. There is a 8 x 11 paper sign pasted on the door. I liked the old place OK and will re-review after finding the new location."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good and the setting and decoration inside was comfy and homy. The server however seemed rushed and didn't help us pick out what we wanted since it was our first time there. We ended up picking the beef bulgogi and rock bowl bibimbop through the rushed order. Will come back perhaps in 1-2 months."}
{"text":"Hot Spot for Lunch.  It is definitely worth the price! The waiter was adorable. He made an effort to practice Korean with us. My Korean classmates and I plan on coming here after we ace our Korean exams every semester :)"}
{"text":"ordered tofu lunch special. it was OK?not too spicy. the potion was huge. i was only able to finish half."}
{"text":"New Seoul is hands down my favorite Korean restaurant in town. The food is good and the pricing is not as expensive as the other Korean restaurants in town. I am a regular at New Seoul and my favorite go to is the Rock Cooker Bibimbap, Kimbap, Beef Bolgogi, and Tukboki. When I'm sick, I love their Tukmandu soup!! The Tukmandu soup has soft slices of rice cakes in it, the broth is clear, and it has some veggies with meat. I'm a sucker for the Rock Cooker Bibimbap because I love their Gojujang(red pepper paste). Honestly, they have the best Gojujang in town. If anyone knows what the magic in that pepper paste, let me know. I've tried a lot."}
{"text":"I have tried this placed three times already with variety of entrees. I am really impressed with their Bibimbab and bulgogi, very tasty and spicy enough for me. Price range is reasonable for college town.  If you like Korean food in home made style, this is the place!  Don't let that look fool you, just walk in!"}
{"text":"From the outside to when I first walked in it was a dive with many Asian people inside. I know this was going to be a treat. Either good or ugly.  Started off with 4 banchans. Daikon radish kimchi, napa cabbage kimchi, caramelized sweet potato, pickled daikon & miso soup. The soup rich in flavor and not overly salty. Can have free refills on the banchan. Both kimchis were good put not much heat. The pickled daikon was sweet and vinegary and the sweet potato was a little weird cause it was like eating cold sweet potato fries.   The Tukbokgi was my favorite. Excellent sweet/spice sauce with chewy rice cakes & fish cakes. Yet again not as spicy as I would have liked it to be. You do get gochujang on the side in a squirt bottle, but that doesn't have much kick for me. Then I had the Rock Cooker Bibimbop. I put a little gochujang in it & mixed it all up. Love the crispy rice on the bottom & how the fried egg on top somewhat scrambles when you mix it up. Almost ends up being fried rice dish with spicy ketchup.   To drink I got Korean Corn Tea. WOW. Intense corn flavor. Nutty & sweet. There was actual roasted corn kernels on the bottom of the cup.   Service was friendly and on top of refilling the water & banchan. One thing I didn't like was that they give you wood chopsticks to use. When scraping the rice off the rock cooker they started to splinter.   If you want killer heat go to K Peppers. They also have stainless steel chopsticks."}
{"text":"Quick, solid Korean. No frills but good in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Good food with a clean and simple taste. Price and sizes of dishes was decent, recommended to those who never had Korean food before and wants to try."}
{"text":"My first experience with Korean food and I was blown away! The bibimbap with chicken was delicious and the right amount of spice at the right temperature. Excellent and speedy service as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. My favorites are Bibimbop, Kalbi or Bulgogi. The quality here is very consistent, and service is decent. This place always has many Korean customers, which to me is an indicator of a good ethnic restaurant.  You can find better Korean food in Chicago for sure, but it would be a big loss for Madison if New Seoul was not part of the local food scene."}
{"text":"Had the Bibimap. Excellent. Ginger tea was very good as well, and i dont normally like sugar in my tea."}
{"text":"Don't let the shabby looking storefront mislead you, if you're craving some Korean food in Madison, you've found the right place.   I ordered the dukbokki along with the tofu soup (pretty much soon doobu jiggae), while my friend had the bibimbap. These dishes are seen in just about every Korean restaurant across the US, so there should be little room for errors. When the appetizer dukbokki came, the serving size surprised me. I thought the appetizer alone was enough to fill one person up, and I was right. The tofu soup was also very generous in portion, bigger than what I've had in other Korean restaurants (NY and LA).   Now for the taste, everything was on par with what I had expected. The duk looked really spicy (it's all red and slimey, delicious looking) but wasn't that spicy at all. The soup which at first I thought wasn't spicy, started making me sweat as I had more of it. The degree of spiciness was just right, and by the end of our dinner, my taste buds were completely satisfied (imagine someone's expression after coming out of a hot steam bath or sauna or something).   The person who took our orders was very friendly and tentative, and the place overall gives a very casual and welcome feeling. I'd imagine on a cold Madison winter day this place to be the perfect spot to sit and sip the delicious, spicy, and hot tofu soup with some friends. I'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"finally made it out for some korean in madison. my expectations where definitely exceeded. incredibly homey. nice people. food tasted really fresh and good. maybe not the best that i've ever had, but beggars can't be choosers. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here with a party of 11 (called earlier that afternoon to make a reservation). We had a great time. The food is good. I had the pork bibimbap, and others had chop chae (jap chae), bulgogi beef and chicken, etc. I haven't tried other Korean restaurants in the area yet to compare, but I was pretty happy with the meal.  The servings were on the large side, the server was very attentive, and the casual atmosphere was great.  The only thing that made it a little difficult was the fact that there were 11 of us, and a bit of a language barrier. So there were a few mix-ups, but the staff took care of things immediately, and I was very impressed just the same."}
{"text":"What a great authentic Korean place on the west side!! This restaurant is very casual, bright, and clean. Service is friendly and always refills your water.  I thought everything tasted like very traditional Korean food. I especially loved the bibimbap in the rock bowl - came out sizzling, perfectly cooked beef and rice, and the egg yolk still runny, YUM! The jambong was my least favorite because it tasted a little bland but was a generous portion size. The kimbop was also fresh, nicely rolled so it didn't fall apart and was easy to take home for next day's lunch.  If you're looking for real Korean food that's fast in Madison, this is it!"}
{"text":"Hooray! Authentic Korean food in Madison!  New Seoul is an unassuming restaurant towards West Towne Mall that really does Korean food the old-fashioned way. No fusion nonsense, no weird Americanized Korean options - their food is something a Korean grandma would recognize and make.  I had to go with classic Korean fare - a pancake appetizer and stone bowl bibimbop. (The pancake is not pajeon, it's a one-person potato-based pancake.) Both were solid, and it came with three side dishes and bottomless soup. Again, A+ for authenticity. The bibimbop had all the right parts, and the mandatory hot sauce was both spicy and flavorful. Did I mention the banchan and soup?   This restaurant has solid food and fills a much-needed culinary void of Korean and in general Asian food in Madison. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food and service were absolutely fantastic! We had an order of deep fried dumplings as an appetizer (1/2 were beef & 1/2 were vegetable). We also had seafood bokum and jambong with noodles. All were perfectly done and very good sized portions. I must add that the ginger hot tea was the best ever. We are most definetly looking forward to going back again very soon."}
{"text":"I've had quite the hunkering for Korean food after moving to Wisconsin and after reading the raving reviews of this place, of course I had to check it out.  I went with someone else and we ended up getting the soondubu jigae (soft tofu soup) and the jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup.) I've been to quite a few Korean restaurants and jjampong can be a hit or miss, so I wasn't expecting too much. However, soondubu jigae is generally a pretty safe bet when you go to any Korean restaurant.   I have never tasted such bland versions of those dishes in. my. life. I'm not generally a picky person, but the broth of either of those dishes was nothing short of barely seasoned water. The spicy seafood noodle soup wasn't spicy in the slightest and tasted more like seafood water. The soft tofu soup, where I had the highest hopes, was severely disappointing in taste and depth. It tasted more like echos of Korean food than actual Korean food.   The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because the side dishes were palatable and free, which isn't always expected nowadays. Service was okay and PERHAPS I tried the wrong dishes. I don't know. There is a slight glimmer of hope that maybe some of their other dishes won't be as abysmal, but only time will tell."}
{"text":"There really isn't a lot of options for Korean food in Madison and this place has the staples. A decent Bi-Bim-Bop and decent Mandu.  The price was a little more expensive than you'd see in Chicago or LA but, again, it's Madison.  It's definitely worth it if you're craving Korean food."}
{"text":"I have lived on the same block for several years and have enjoyed having this place so close. It's one step up from a hole in the wall, and it's all about the food. On a recent visit we ordered the galbi (barbecued beef short ribs) and the beef tendon soup. Both were excellent. Their galbi is incredibly flavorful, with a combination of savory, sweet, and grilled flavor that is out of this world. (Often when I pass by the restaurant I smell it outside and it makes me salivate!) The beef tendon soup was delicious as well, with a generous serving of the gelatinous tendons and a great sesame sauce. (Not only is the soup tasty, it's very healthy--the gelatin and amino acids glycine and proline are great for joint health and aid digestion as well. Meat/bone broths in general are a great source of minerals and other micronutrients.)  With every meal, New Seoul serves 4 appetizer dishes: 2 of kimchi (1 daikon radish, 1 Napa cabbage, both just the right amount of spicy and tangy), 1 of mild pickled daikon \"spaghetti\", and 1 of sweet fried potatoes (my least favorite). Their kimchi is, of course, excellent, and our waitress gave us a second serving of everything on the house after seeing how fast we devoured the first. Yes!   Service has always been quick and friendly. My main quibble is that their new prices are a bit high. The galbi was $18.95 (used to be $15.95) and consists of only 4 thin strips of beef. It does come with rice and a small bowl of miso soup, but is still overpriced.  Though I'm leaving town, I hope to eat at New Seoul again. With the large new mixed-use development nearly complete across the street, I hope they get additional business and don't change anything about their food. Madison needs more authentic, no-frills ethnic restaurants like this."}
{"text":"New Seoul completely blew me away these past few weeks. I've been coming here for lunch with some people from work, and each experience has been so great.  Servers and staff are always accommodating and so sweet. Our server our past few visits is a kind Korean man who checked up on us frequently and was quick to get our orders, checks, and refills of water. Absolute turnaround from my first experience.  Dining area is pretty empty during lunch, which surprises me because the food is absolutely delicious. I've tried new dishes since my last review, such as the pork bokum, kimcheejiggae, jjambong, and fried dumplings. Pork bokum is delightfully spicy and flavorful, and it's been a favorite for my coworkers who are less familiar with Korean food. Kimcheejigae is a broth made from rice cakes, pork, and kimchee, and it's absolutely delicious. This one is more sour, spicy, and definitely more flavorful (so if you don't like the taste of kimchee, that is not for you). Jjambong is a noodle soup with seafood and another spicy broth. It's very tasty, but my favorite dish will forever be the ddukmanduguk.   New Seoul has become my new favorite lunch location. Service is attentive and quick, and food has been just amazing. I noticed that I miss my mother's home cooking when I dine here, which just shows me how delicious and authentic this Korean food is."}
{"text":"Came here early to this unassuming place and managed to snag one of the last tables in this small restaurant. It seems like an authentic mom and pop sort of place and I really appreciated the expansive menu they had. There were three small cold dishes to share in the beginning (kimchi, a sweet potato, and sliced radish) that were tasty and seemed homemade. Because the restaurant was pretty full, it took awhile for our food to come out (though we did get a Beef Jungol, which is a soup meant for two). The soup was authentic and the broth was tasty, with beef, napa cabbage, large noodles and chunks of octopus, which I really appreciated. We ate to our heart's content and still had a bit of leftover food for lunch the next day.   Looking around, the bibimbop looked delicious and we'll definitely come back sometime to try it! Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some authentic Korean food. I just wished that they had KBBQ too!  Edit: Also tried the chapjae and a seafood tofu soup. Both were extremely tasty and filling. The soup had great flavor and the little chunks of seafood were nice. The chapjae was perfectly chewy and well worth the highly steep price. Loved it!  Edit 2: definitely prefer the seafood tofu soup over the clear beef one."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about Korean food, but this food was super tasty. I had the korean fried chicken sweet, salty, and spicy; my Babe had the korean thin beef thing. Like I said, I don't know much about this food but it sure tastes good. Try it, it's fun that we have all these great ethnic foods to try in Madison."}
{"text":"I was prepared to be disappointed.  This place was surprisingly more authentic and better than what I had expected.  If you're ethnic food adverse, you can't go wrong w/ the Bulgogi, Galbi, or Rock Bowl Bibimbop."}
{"text":"I was under the weather and wanted to get some soup. The menu is limited, which is good because a restaurant that isn't that big should perfect the limited dishes.   I ordered the small Korean chicken ginseng soup. It took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. There were only 3 side dishes. The amount of rice they gave was rather large. The soup was so hot. I'm so glad that they provided a small dish with salt and pepper to add some flavor. Their menu is not too extensive. A lot of people popped in to pick up To Go orders. For one of the few Korean places in Madison (non-existent in this town pretty much)--- it was decent. I think some of their prices are overpriced, but they can do that because there aren't really any other Korean restaurants here.  Side dishes were limiting -- just potatoes, kimchi, and some radish. I wanted fish cake, spinach, broccoli, and some anchovies. This place makes me want to open my own Korean Restaurant...haha.  Anyways-- totally recommend for anyone who needs their \"fix\" of Korean Food -- just be aware that you'll be paying $$$ for it..."}
{"text":"I love the small local places! This cozy little restaurant is no exception. I was really craving some korean food in the Madison area and I think I've found my go to place. I'll definitely be coming back to try some more of their food. We had the two person pot thing and the flavor was awesome. Really recommend it to anybody who wants to try some good Korean food."}
{"text":"New Seoul will be at a new location starting Sept. 2014!  I came here one afternoon for lunch and when I walked in my fellow patrons were all Asians. Good sign!!!  I got my all time fav Korean comfort food. Kimchi soup with pork. I wish I could have tried more but there's only so much you can order when you are on your own.  As per protocol at a Korean restaurant they bring out mini side dishes before your meal starts. There was kimchi (napa cabbage) picked radish, and potato chunks (sweetened).  My kimchi soup was brought out in a stone bowl which kept nice and hot! I thought it tasted pretty authentic. I definitely think it's the most authentic place I've tried so far in Madison.  If you order Korean BBQ it looks like they do bring a gas grill out to your table for you to cook your meat. As far as I could tell from observing what another table was eating."}
{"text":"Warning: Non-Korean reviewer  I have eaten at New Seoul at least 20-25 times.   On my recent visit I noticed that they updated their decor a bit, with new tables and seating. A welcome change. The place has not had much investment in this area.  I have found their food to be consistently excellent, with nice portions and no variation in quality from one meal to the next. Their Squid Bokum is out of this world - tasty and full of meat. The Beef Bulgogi is wonderfully spiced and the portions are generous.  I have found the service to be always very attentive and accommodating, especially to little kids.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service: (5/5) The man was polite and kept our drinks refilled.  He also refreshed our sweet potato side dish because we all ate it so fast.    Dukbokki was soooooooooo delicious.  One of the best ones I've had. (5/5)  Kimbap - it was good but I usually like beef in mine.  This one doesn't come with beef.  Only crab.  (4/5)  Tofu soup: Really good. I love how the soft tofu melts in your mouth.  There was a good amount of sea food in this dish.  Yum! (5/5)  Fried seasoned chicken with sauce (forgot the name and don't have a menu on hand)  This tasted like orange chicken you would get from a Chinese restaurant, but better.  (4/5)  Thinly sliced beef: Aww yeah.  This well marinated.  I liked it. (5/5)"}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant at around 7 pm. The waiter was so unfriendly, probably because we were the only guests in that restaurant? I ordered a seafood ramen bowl. Shrimp was chewy. Too much cabbage. Overall, a big disappoinment."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch takeaway. I ordered pork bokum, asking if it came with a little bit of kimchi on the side. The dude said yes, but it's not clear to me whether that comes automatically.  The rice was the shorter grain sticky kind preferred in east asia, and perfectly cooked. The pork and veggies were perfectly seasoned with just enough sauce to trickle down and season the rice. It looked like the spiciest thing on the lunch menu but was just kind of \"midwestern spicy\". I like spice and this usually annoys me because I know that a Korean would make it much hotter for themself, but it was seasoned so well that it didn't need heat to cover it up. Kimchee was similarly spicy and not too funky.  This was a big lunch for 8 bucks. For weekday lunch they had three tables seated by Koreans.  I got my order in about three minutes.  I give 5 stars when I don't think there was anything they could have done better. The food here absolutely blows away any Chinese or Japanese place I've been to in the Madison area.  You'll need to pay attention to the explanation on the menu of what the star rating system for heat is. It's not done like most places. It's more to do with how customizable the heat is than how hot the dish will be."}
{"text":"PROS: Good portions, cheap, seemingly healthy CONS: Mediocre fare  They have all the standard selections a Korean restaurant should have: dumplings, kimchi pancakes, kimbap, bibimbap, etc., served with complimentary sides (banchan). The food is decent and healthy, but nothing spectacular. For Madison, this may be as good as it gets for Korean fare."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We came in at 6pm on a Friday night and got seated right away. It started to fill up when we were leaving at 7. Laaaaaarge portions. My 4yr old and I shared a small kimbap and small samgaetang and we were stuffed. There weren't many side dishes like I've come to except though. We only had 3 (sweet fried potatoes, pickled radish and of course kimchi). The kimchi was really good though the potatoes were too sweet. Overall really enjoyed. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Review is for the new location near Alisha Ashman Library.  I'd been to the previous location several times-- always good, always friendly service, but always slooooow service (they only had one person serving every time I'd been there).  Food at the new location was a good as the previous location (same owners, same everything).  Everything tasted fresh.  Still only one guy doing all the serving and ringing up the bill, but we managed to get in an out in under an hour for lunch (which I would have doubted at the old location).  They were plenty busy when we were there.  I'd probably give this place a 3-star rating, but good Korean food now 2 minutes from my house earns it an extra!"}
{"text":"Well since all the reviews got cleared out when they moved from their University Avenue location, I'll post another one for their \"new\" location (though I would guess they have been here about a year now).  I'll just say that as the weather starts to get cold, a big steaming bowl of the rock cooker bibimbap is pretty awesome.  The spicy sauce is served separate, so you can tailor it to how you like it (it's a bit bland without the sauce, and great with the sauce).  I'm probably not a great critic of Korean food, because I seem to like it every time I get it, wherever I get it.  Regardless, I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Great place to get some great Korean food .    Chicken Bibimbop!!!  Service was good.  Everything was delicious.   If you are in Madison come check this out!!!"}
{"text":"After going to the wrong location, we arrived just before they were closing between lunch and dinner. The server made sure we didn't feel awkward about the timing, which was so nice!  The food was tasty and reasonably priced! If it wasn't so far away, we'd be back for sure!"}
{"text":"While I am not Korean, the food at New Seoul has a certain homecooked quality that I imagine would come from a Korean household. I've dined here a handful of times and I always leave satisfied. In particular, their Tukbokgi, Chopchae, and Rock Bowl Bibimbap never disappoint. You get a few complementary side dishes like raddish, potatoes, and kim chee with every meal and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4 stars. Korean food in Madison is not as bad as you would expect, but I've never really had anything that excites me. They don't give much banchan - we got some glazed soft potatoes (which were fantastic), kimchi, and some seasoned cabbage.  The stone bowl bibimbap was a very large portion for its price, which was nice. We also tried the beef bulgogi which was good, but not anything unique.   Overall, a good place to check out, but I do think there are better Korean places in Madison, including Sol's on the Square (which is more pricey though)."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the most under-rated place in Madison. This place gets you the homey taste of Korea more than ultra fine Korean cuisine. I appreciated the down to earth feeling.  As someone else mentioned, go for the tofu soup ($10-12) - uber good on a cold night. My fiance ordered a potato-noodle dish. That tasted good, too.  I also heard that the food quality improved over the years. Is that because we have more Korean residents in Madison who demands the real-deal? Who knows. I found many Korean-speaking patrons last night, and took it as a good sign.  The decor is simple. Don't expect some exotic orient thing - you're not going to see anything like that here. More like conference table+chair type. The service was simple, but polite and thorough."}
{"text":"By now considered a Madison institution, New Seoul has been serving up as close to authentic Korean cuisine as you'll find in the area, unless you crash someone's dinner party. I recently grabbed a late lunch there while walking home from downtown Madtown. An unassuming storefront and simple decor will make you think the food is the sole (Seoul?) focus, which is fine with me. In all my years of eating there, I've only scratched the surface of the menu, because I just can't get past their Rock Cooker Bibimbop. A superheated stone bowl sizzling with rice, layered with sprouts, spinach greens, shredded carrots, and tofu, topped with a sunny-side up egg, this dish is one of the simplest, most satisfying meals to be had, and is a great demonstration of an evolving dining experience, as temperature, texture, sights and sounds change as you dig in. The egg yolk transforms from runny creaminess to rich, almost hard-boiled texture as it sizzles against the rock bowl, the crisped fried egg white in tow. The veggies, starting out cold, change from fresh and snappy to yielding and caramelized in minutes. Excavating  through the rice, the pillowy starchiness gives way to a crisp shell that's a great contrast. All through this, enjoy an assortment of the usual suspects- miso soup, kimchi, pickled radish and cucumber, and candied sweet potatoes- to complete the dining experience. And if that doesn't do it  for you, there's always that stick of Juicy Fruit gum that comes with every purchase. Service was prompt and cordial as always, and the food was amazing. The only reasons I have for giving 4 stars instead of 5 are personal preferences. I am a fan of spicy kimchi, yet the variety served here tastes \"younger\" and less fermented than I prefer. And, having tried such a small portion of the menu, I feel like I can't give a complete review. Next time I visit I'll try something new, and maybe we'll bump them up to a 5!"}
{"text":"Could this Madison foodie find culinary love in a non-descript West side strip mall?    Surprisingly, the answer is a resounding yes, as I found my Korean comfort food soulmate at New Seoul Restaurant.  It wasn't love at first sight as things got off to a tentative start.  Unclear if the restaurant provided table service, I ordered at the counter, paid for my meal and then colonized a table in the completely empty dining area. The cashier indicated my food would be ready in ten minutes, but I barely had time to remove my coat and get settled in when he arrived with a brown paper bag bulging with the contents of my lunch order.  Sheepishly, I mentioned I wanted to dine, and without hesitation, the host immediately brought out a plate, glass of water and silverware (he must have sensed my trepidation of exposing my utter ineptitude using chopsticks).  For the rest of the meal, the impeccably polite gentleman who fulfilled all of the front of house duties made sure my first experience at New Seoul was fantastic.  As the dining room started to fill with lunch patrons, he continually scanned the dining room, checking for completion of a course, empty dishes to whisk away and beverage glasses in need of refill.    With its bright yellow walls adorned with Asian artwork, the restaurant provides a cheerful venue to consume a meal.  The interior is tidy and well maintained, with uniform dark brown tables and chairs.  The restaurant gets a fair amount natural light from windows on two of the four walls in the dining area.    Because of the confusion over my order type, I did not receive the complimentary banchan appetizer plate that was supplied to the other patrons who elected to dine at the restaurant.  I did receive a lavish portion of the delightfully crisp, homemade kimchi that provided plenty of comforting warmth to accompany its bright clean flavors.  Speaking of warmth, my entrée, the spicy pork bokum, which consisted of marinated pork, sautéed onions and green onion, created a mini heat wave during my late January visit.  The dish was the perfect marriage of robust pork flavor and soulful Asian seasoning. While this dish is not for the timid, I enjoyed the heat this dish generated by the Gochujang after the first couple of bites.  (Side note: Props to the host for delivering an extra napkin to dab off the beads of sweat forming on my forehead.)  Though the dish was a touch greasy, the meat was well-trimmed and expertly prepared, featuring well-developed flavors.  For a mere $7.99, the dish was a tremendous value, considering the generous portion size.  While there are a number of intriguing options on the lunch menu, I sense that allure of the comforting pork bokum too hard to overcome.   During my visit, the dining room never exceed 30% capacity, which is a shame, given the quality and value of the food.  During my stay, I did notice that New Seoul enjoys a brisk carryout trade over the lunch hour.  I'm still mourning the 2014 closure of American Latina Mexican Restaurant located in the same strip mall - I'd hate to see New Seoul suffer the same fate."}
{"text":"This will do, but only because it is one of the three Korean restaurants in all of Madison.   The tofu soup that I ordered was...lacking, to say the least. For $10, I expected a decent assortment of seafood and other ingredients in my soup, but I guess I set my expectations too high. I've had my fair share of tofu soups on both coasts, and the New Seoul tofu soup didn't even come close to the most basic of tofu soups I've had. The flavor of the soup itself was pretty good. Not what I'm used to, but still acceptable. My major gripe was with the lack of anything other than tofu in my soup.   The banchan was below average as well. We had three different side dishes: the fried sweet potato, kimchi, and some sort of pickled radish. Nothing really stood out, and nothing seemed to have required a significant amount of thought or preparation. For a family-owned restaurant, it seemed odd that they didn't try to serve something more authentic or more 'homemade' to really get that home-cooked feel.   I think the only thing worth ordering at New Seoul would be the bibimbap, whether you get it in a regular or stone bowl. The portions are large and it comes served with a side of miso soup. There is definitely enough food for two meals - unless you are my friend. He inhaled the bibimbap like there was no tomorrow."}
{"text":"really really cold bibimbap.  super-ketchupy super-weak-ass chili sauce."}
{"text":"You want a real family style Korean meal? You come here. You are given kimchee, daikon radish, and other lovely typical pre-meal treats before your meal comes. Wide range of dishes. Friendly staff. Our favorite Korean place."}
{"text":"Slim pickings in Madison so if you're in a real jam and craving Korean then New Seoul will do. But if you're a true Korean food aficionado you will be underwhelmed.  On a side note, the new location is in a nice area but the interior is akin to a White Caste circa 1996... so again, it's only ideal if you're in a real jam."}
{"text":"This place is not very good. They only gave us three side dishes and they were not great. Kimchi pancake was not good at all. Pork Bulgogi was decent."}
{"text":"The beef bulgoki was incredible but not nearly enough for an entree at the price. The rice to dish ratio was certainly heavy on the white sticky stuff, but the food was delicious. This place is a 4-star restaurant at 5-star prices.. which brings it down to a 3-star rating from this guy. It's math.   I would eat here again and probably still order the over-priced beef bulgoki, it's that good."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant in town! Try their bulgogi or the stone bowl. The appetizers are also very good."}
{"text":"New Seoul was one of the first local Korean restaurant that I visited here in the Madison/Middleton area and it has a great selection of authentic Korean dishes. My favorites would be the kimbap (Korean sushi rolls), as well as the tofu soup and bibimbap.   Although, they don't do delivery, you can order food for takeout. With that in mind, I would recommend sitting in for the tofu soup and the rock bowl bibimbap. There's only a few tables available to dine in, but we've never had to wait too long for a table. I've come a few times with friends and it's accommodating for slightly larger groups as well. For instance, I've come with a group of 6-8 friends before and we were able to get a table just fine.  In terms of the food, the dumplings and kimbap appetizers are really delicious. In fact, I usually alternate between ordering kimbap as an entree (that is, I get 20 pieces instead of 10). Typically, I'd have leftovers, but I recall finishing it all for my last meal, so I'd definitely have to come back for some more again soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not the bastion of knowledge when it comes to korean food.  Frankly my exposure to this cuisine is limited to all my wonderful korean friends that bring the kimchi (I HAVE NO IDEA how it's spelled) based dishes to potlucks (aaahhh, to be a student... but better is to be a student and bring something other than the ubiquitous chips and salsa....)  So maybe I don't have the taste for this.   My friends claim it's very traditional korean.  Is this a good thing?  I don't know...  All I do know is that everytime I go there, it's meh...  Bonus, it's three blocks from me, so I can't complain too much.  Decor is pathetically bad though...  Not that THAT should be all that important, but hell, if the food is meh and the decor is clean and proper, i'd probably give it more stars..  Although I think I overstar anyway...."}
{"text":"The best Korean restaurant to me in Madison. We come here once a week. The taste is good while price is lower compared to the two other ones I have tried."}
{"text":"this place is a whack. we, a group six people with two kids came in on a Saturday evening and the owner turned us away! with an empty dinning room we were told to find another place to eat! I cannot believe this is how a restaurant treats  customers. local yelpers, be reminded, you may get the same experience."}
{"text":"So glad there is an awesome Korean restaurant on the westside of Madison.   We love the beef and pork bulgogi. Our 4 year old son devours the beef bulgogi and miso soup. I really enjoy the bimbimbop with beef. Portions are plentiful as well. The side you get are almost always the same but really good; kimchi, daikon radish, and potatoes is a sweet type of sauce. They will give you more if you ask; last time they asked if we wanted more which was nice.  Service is always pretty good. The same gentleman always works the front. He's pretty fast even when the dining area get busy. Will keep coming back when a craving for Korean food hits."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like New Seoul. I was craving bibimbap, so I was pretty excited to see that I don't live too far from New Seoul!  I ordered the bibimbap that came in the hot stone bowl. Sadly, the rice in it was too watery and never crisped up like it was supposed to. I also got a bad stomachache following this meal, but I'm not sure if it was the amount of oil that was the cause or something unrelated.  We ordered the tukbokki to start. It came with the flat fish cake. I don't remember much else in. The gochujang sauce was pretty standard."}
{"text":"We have been here before when they were at University Ave. Now they're at Old Sauk Rd. at a nicer, cleaner, brighter location. This place still has the best Korean food in Madison. The food is still the same and delicious as ever! We ordered the galbi, bimbimbop, and a stirfry tofu dish. It was all very delicious and that fed all 3 of us very well. Service was good and quick. The side dishes were good and they were willing to give us more when we asked. I would definitely return here again as I did today!"}
{"text":"Don't go here.  Service was lousy and I think we were forgotten about for a long time.  I ordered bulgogi but got something else.  Get it for take-out if you have a Korean fix."}
{"text":"Big fan of the chicken bokkeum lunch special. At $8 - such a great value!! Very flavorful and a nicely sized portion."}
{"text":"Overall great Korean food...in a forgettable setting with mediocre service.  I arrived with a group of five around 5:30 on a Thursday night and the place was beginning to fill. We were lucky to get a table...we watched many parties get turned away behind us. Very slow turnover, so come early if you want in!  The service was slow but not unfriendly. Our server spoke good English and was able answer my questions about the menu. If you are unfamiliar with Korean fare, deinitely ask questions and you will have a much more enjoyable experience.  The restaurant itself is small and it's easy to drive right past its drab exterior. There is a parking lot behind the building. The interior decorating certainly isn't formal or high class, but who's to complain when you can eat....  Good Food! I tried an appetizer with  Korean rice cakes in a spicy sauce (can't remember the name). The standard spice was fine for me but if you don't like things too spicy be sure to request a milder sauce. My main course was the bibimbap with tofu, which I loved. The rock bowl came out sizzling and all the ingredients tasted fresh and were perfectly cooked. I also sampled some of the tofu soup and a dish with potato noodles--both were tasty. The prices were reasonable.  If you're feeling a little adventurous and don't mind mediocre service, come to New Seoul."}
{"text":"We tried to go back to the Italian restaurant across the street for another pizza but the wait was too long. Across the street we noticed a Korean 'joint'. Different but, it had that 'look' that could be magic, could be gross.  We poked our heads in and it was full of Asians.  A good sign so, in we went. This is solid Korean cuisine. We shared a pancake appetizer. I had a Tofu soup, the Spousal Unit had Beef Bulgogi. Both were quite tasty. Looking for Korean food in Madison? This will do it."}
