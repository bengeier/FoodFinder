{"text":"After my Friday Workout, thought of giving myself a treat so i debated myself with different options and made my way to Jems jerk which is in the same plaza as my gym. This was my second visit and the same experience as before. The girl at the front desk is not that welcoming and was busy texting. I interrupted her and said 'Hi' and ordered my food. No Suggestions or Questions asked. My order was out in couple of minutes - thats fast ! I decided to eat in my car as the place was small and little low lit for me. I oppened the box (curry goat with rice ) and immediately could smell  the curry. The food was fresh and hot. The goat meat was very tender and had some good pieces. Rice and peas cooked to perfection. The food was not too spicy for me but it had all the flavours to make it perfect. You can tell by eating their meat that its been cooked with lots of patience. Coleslaw was bit sweet for me as i like tangy but i enjoyed it ! Overall, good food, pricey as compared to other jerk places but worth the quality. They can add little more quantity to their large sized takeouts. Must try ! - and dont miss their lunch specials to try different dishes at low price. Only Mon, Tue and Wed's."}
{"text":"I ordered their chicken roti for takeout, but after a couple minutes the lady at the counter apologized and said the chicken wasn't available did I want something else. I ended up getting the jerk chicken dinner instead and she didn't charge me extra even though it was more expensive.  I'm really glad I ended up with the jerk chicken. It is absolutely delicious! The seasoning on the chicken is so flavourful. There's a mellow heat so it won't be a problem for any spice wimps. The dinner was served with rice and carrot and cabbage slaw. Both side dishes were so good. The slaw had a pleasing sweetness to it. And the rice was seasoned well, fluffy, and studded with beans. They also give you an incredibly huge amount of food. This is easily enough for two or three meals.   This is probably more of a takeout place than a sit-down restaurant. They do have a few tables, but it's not a traditional sit-down setup.   I am definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Jerk and fried chicken is always good.  People are friendly.  Oxtail is ok, I prefer it with more spice.  Rice and peas is average.  Portions are decent, not piled on but not under filled."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving Jamaican this is where I come.  Really nice tasting jerk chicken and oxtail..portions are massive and they are not stingy. Whenever I need my fix I come here and it never disappoints me.  Whenever I come here this place is PACKEd!  Updated my review because I find myself comparing all Jamaican food to the kind of food I get over here"}
{"text":"Gems Jerk is another quick place around the block from me. Its a small dimly lighted place, jammin' to reggae. Normally with places like these, its better to order take out and eat in your car since people walk in and just hang out there waiting for their food so its kind of weird having people watching you hard. So the last time I went the lady taking my order was fast and friendly. I got the jerk chicken with oxtail gravy with plantain, accompanied by your basic rice and peas with coleslaw. One word, delicious! I love how fresh and meaty it is, since its not all bone like some Carribbean restaurants. I usually grab a Carribbean tropics mango carrot drink or cream soda in a bottle. Definitely a great restaurant to check out in Brampton."}
{"text":"Just had Gem's for lunch today.......Delicious.......go get some right now!  I will be going back next time I'm in town.  We had the jerk chicken with peas and rice and coleslaw and curry chicken with some Roti.............all of it was demolished in minutes........."}
{"text":"Peel Health shut this place down for pests and bad housekeeping in Dec 2016. Its such a pity. Who doesn't love jerk?,. They have since reopened but I would pass on this one as I don't think it's their first time."}
{"text":"This place is good if you are looking for a quick Jerk Chicken fix.  It will satisfy your craving and you may or may not be back for more.  However, it is one of the few places you can Jerk Chicken in the area and I can see why it does well.  The restaurant seems to be family run and the food is made fresh on a daily basis.  Oxtail, Jerk chicken, and delicious rice combo will definitely make you full. Service is quick when ordering something to go."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch from here a couple of times. Their daily specials are cheap and you get a ton of food (great value). Their jerk chicken and beef patties are delicious, not too spicy. Their coleslaw is just OK but it's not a deal breaker either"}
{"text":"Had stew chicken (Monday special) with rice and salad. The chicken was good, rice was OK and the salad was really bad - wilted/frozen letuce with a few frozen cuccumber slices. Seriously at $11 a plate they could do better on the salad. I asked if they had coleslaw but nope \"this is the salad we have today and that's all\". I asked for water and was given a bottle of water at extra charge. C'mon now. 3 stars and only because the chicken was actually OK."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The lady was very rude and gave one word answers. I asked for extra  sauce and once I received my order there was no sauce at all. The Jerk chicken  tasted like it was old and tasteless. Don't bother coming to this location.  I've had Jerk chicken all over GTA and this by far was the worst."}
{"text":"I have had better oxtail.  This place is not bad but there are a few other places in Brampton that the oxtail is better and cheaper - check out Betajerk or Portland jerk both on queen street."}
{"text":"Yummmmy! Great deals Monday-Thursday before 4pm! Delicious oxtail! Melt in your mouth!   Very welcoming staff!"}
{"text":"Got the large jerk chicken for $10.50 plus tax. Food came in pretty quick and had a LOT of meat.    CHICKEN: Probably 3-4 leg quarters (at least it felt like it). The seasoning was excellent, chicken moist and hot enough to have an actual kick but not too much that id need water. Though it was sweeter than most jerk chicken ive had.  RICE: The gravy they put on the rice was excellent, rice was perfectly cooked.  SLAW: Only downside is the slaw. It was not tasty  and lacked seasoning. Though it did give each bite a good crunch.   SERVICE: Im not much for this since I did not dine in, but the cashier didnt give off a friendly vibe, at the least.  Bonus: they do have daily specials ( M-Th I think) for $6.00+tax. But for almost double the price, you can probably get two or three times the amount of food (if you get the regular price large) and eat it for two to three meals, and itll save you a trip"}
{"text":"Meh.  I just needed my Jamaican food fix and I was in the area so I yelped around the area to see the best and I must say this place is rated highly for no reason.   I ordered the large size oxtail and stew chicken with rice and peas combo. Came up to $15- decent price I guess but definitely not worth it. Oxtail was mostly the fatty part of the tail. Let me not start on the \"stew chicken\" it's basically a drumstick soaked and cooked in spicy soy sauce. I mean I must've been spoiled because the stew chicken I imagined would be similar to Sunrise restaurant.   If I'm in the area, I'd probably look elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Out of all the jerk places on this side of town Gem's gets my top pick. The portions are the largest and the taste imo is the best."}
{"text":"Had there Jerk chicken its good. However there beef patties are horrible! The worse i've ever had. So everything is good but there beef patties. And if you ask the young woman working there she'll tell you she's doesnt know what there patties taste like because she's never had it. Another sign that the beef patties are bad. If the workers can't recommend it then why sell it? And update your register to take American visa and mastercards guys!"}
{"text":"The go-to place to get jerk chicken near my house.  Portion size is generous and satisfying.  They tend to be a bit heavy-handed with the spice and that sometimes makes it painful to eat. But I still very much enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Good Jamaican food. Ya mon"}
{"text":"Got a small jerk chicken taste like stew chicken with pepper for 9.61 not a rass not ever again"}
{"text":"This place man,... Just go there and eat. Proper food, amazing staff. Jerk chicken is on fire but has a beautiful sweet kick to it, very good and different, a must try. Coleslaw was just a plain and simple one, real thing that shines is the chicken and rice. Definitely top 5 I've tried."}
{"text":"This restaurant lacks focus about what it really is... Is it a takeout place or a grocery store or a catering company... The owners are trying to be everything for everyone and are missing their mark.   I came in here for a quick bite and picked this restaurant out of three or four available options because I felt like having jerk chicken.  The chicken was good, moist and flavourful.  Where it lacked is on the sides.  I asked the server that I will be dining in and don't want any rice and would rather have some salad.  I was given a take out tray with chicken and half full of coleslaw which is found inappropriate.  They also don't provide you with knifes unless you ask for it.  I would rate it a 3... definitely not a place where you sit down rather best to do takeout..."}
{"text":"OK I give this place a three star not because I didn't like the food but because it didn't taste like Jamaican ox tail. I ordered the large ox tail with peas and rice and the portion was awesome. It tasted absolutely fresh and delicious. My only issue is that it actually doesn't taste like the Jamaican ox tail stew that I normally get at other Jamaican restaurants. It doesn't taste Jamaican at all. The peas and rice were delicious and the coleslaw was meh. We also ordered Jamaican beef patty's which were some of the best that I've ever had in my life.. I have mixed emotions about this place based on the flavour of the ox tail but overall the food was absolutely fresh and delicious. Would I go again? Probably not because it doesn't taste like what I was hoping it would taste like."}
{"text":"If you've ate here, you cannot deny that the food is good. Gems is a bit further from me than many other Jamaican restaurants so whenever I'm in the area I have to have it! The food is made with love simply put. You know the meat is good when you are sucking all the flavours out of the bone. The oxtail is tender, moist and flavourful. The chicken is same. The food isn't spicy (most Jamaican places don't serve spicy food and have hot sauce available) for those who can't handle the heat. I would give this place 5 stars if the food wasn't so expensive. For two large meals and two drinks it came up to 30 dollars. The closer you get to Toronto the cheaper Jamaican food gets and the great flavours are still there."}
{"text":"I had been here once before with my daughter about 3 years ago. It was just as good this time. i ordered the large Jerk Chicken and was not disappointed. It was a little more saucy than I preferred but the sweet spicy taste made up for it. service was excellent."}
{"text":"Gems is not your average jerk chicken place you will find around town. They actually have several locations around Brampton. Their service is what you would expect from a Caribbean restaurant but the food is amazing.! Their ox tail is hands down unbeatable in town and its not just bone! There is sooooo much meat.! The jerk chicken is the traditional style and comes with rice and peas and coleslaw. You cant go wrong. The only reason why it lost a star is that it is more expensive than the other places. Roughly $5 but well worth it. If you havent tried it, its a must try!"}
