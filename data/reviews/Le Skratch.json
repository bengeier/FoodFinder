{"text":"Went there with four of my buddies on November 22, 2013 after a year or so and I have to say the place has become a major dive. My biggest problem though was a total Quebec separist came up to me and in French called me a \"Maudit Chinois\". Told the guy to watch what he was saying but all he could say was he didn't understand English. Anyway the manager came to find out what was going on. I told him exactly what went on and instead of removing the drunk he just said, \"Don't mind him he's just like that\" Asked if the guy was a regular and he confirmed this. Wow, no wonder it's a dive. The funny thing is the owner of the establishment is an asian. So instead of removing the trash they welcome it out of desparation for costumers. A street over to the east there is another pool bar Shooters which actually treats their costomers with a bit more respect. Avoid this dive at all cost. The one star I am giving is more than they deserve. (It won't let me put no stars) I wil never step foot into that place again."}
