{"text":"I grew up in Hawaii and this food is pretty dang close to the local food. We had kalua pork, chicken katsu, BBQ beef, Hawaiian noodles, and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Our 1st time here. 

Plenty of parking.

Quick + warm service.

Prices are competitive to other similar Island spots in the valley. Good value.

We ordered...
Teriyaki chicken bowl
BBQ chicken + beef with veggies
Chicken katsu + beef with rice
Chicken BBQ with noodles
Beef plate

All were tasty and cooked as they should.

We will be returning soon! ;D"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hawaiian food, the best I've had here in the main land. Very friendly staff as well. I would give them six stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great food. Takes awhile to cook but flavor and portions are amazing. Everything was good. Had the katsu and BBQ mix. Hard to decide which meat was the best."}
{"text":"I give this place four stars for the service and for the portion sizes.  But perhaps only 3 stars for the food.  Yesterday, I went and ordered the family meal with kalua pork, bbq beef, and chicken katsu.  Cost was about $40 including tax and a $3 upgrade grade for the beef.  The portion size was very, very good and I hope this doesn't represent only  introductory portion sizes due to them being new.  Even the rice and macaroni salad was plentiful.  I also liked the fact that they include not only saut√©ed cabbage as the veggie, but a little bit of broccoli too.  However, the kalua pork was bland -- not enough salt, nor liquid smoke, or fat.  When you make kalua pig in the oven or crockpot, you gotta use fatty pork butt or picnic cut and lots of liquid smoke.  The BBQ beef was also not very tasty - both the marinade and the fact that it was not grilled but put on the flat-top.  However, the chicken katsu was excellent.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Food was delicious, place was immaculate and service was great and prompt!  I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 100 stars if I could. If you want authentic Hawaiian BBQ this is the place to go.  I had the seafood mix combo and it was delicious. Th white fish and shrimp were yummy as was the teriyaki chicken. The rice was perfect \"sticky rice\" from Hawaii and the macaroni salad tasted like it was directly from the islands. Sooooooo.. good!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! I got the beef/chicken combo plate and it was delicious! You get so much food for a decent amount of money. The employees were very helpful and made for a welcoming environment. Can't wait to go back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Yup..that's the word.  I ordered their BBQ Mix and Crab Rangoons.  The BBQ Mix came with macaroni salad, rice, and veggies.  Everything was delicious.  The staffs were nice, welcoming, and helpful.  Will be back for more. :)"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the food. The building has a fast food feel and atmosphere. But do not expect fast food. Order takes about 10 minutes. 
I had a beef and chicken combo. Was a lot of food for the price.both the beef and chicken were tender and tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm so amazed with the amazing group of employees they have and the food they give you a generous amount! This place is gonna go big! I'm really satisfied and amazed with it!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian place I've found in the valley. 

I've been to Hawaii multiple times, this food is as legit as you'll get on the islands."}
{"text":"I'm not one of those people drawn to Hawaiian food, or BBQ for that matter. However, I was scrolling through Yelp for somewhere to eat and my kid saw this place and was dead set on going, so we went (despite my not being too thrilled).

Honestly, nothing really looked amazing to me on the menu. I ended up ordering a combo of chicken and beef, my son got a mini beef, and my husband got the katsu and noodles (which we ordered to go as he was home). We waited a bit and I observed the area. The people working there were super nice, attentive, and were very concerned with the cleanliness of the place. 

We got our food and dug in. Wow. The beef looked dry and chewy but it was in fact moist (sorry for those of you that hate the word) and tender. It had a slight sweetness to it, as did the chicken that was equally moist and tender. There was a good amount of cabbage and broccoli under the meat in both plates, which was a nice surprise. The rice was rice like (nothing special there), but it was especially good with a little katsu or teriyaki sauce on it that we got from their condiment station. The Mac salad was freaking phenomenal. Especially with a little bit of the sweet meats in the same bite. I'm salivating right now writing this review, it was that good.

So obviously I am now a big fan of Hawaiian food if it is made as well as it is at this place. I totally get the fuss and I'm super glad my son has such good taste in food. Btw, he ate most of it and he's only 7. He says he would give this place 5 1/2 stars, so I would say that means it's kid friendly, too."}
{"text":"YUM!!! This place was awesome.  My hubby and I snuck away to try this new place for a late lunch and it was really great.
We ordered the Katsu chicken, and Barbecue beef (Hawaiian style) with noodles. Everything was hot off the grill and huge portions. We took half home with us.  The service takes a few minutes more than other counter/order meals BUT it's worth it!! Fresh always tastes better.
I can't say enough good things about this place. I saw real owner pride (refreshing) We use to go to Teriyaki Madness but it doesn't hold a candle to this place (Sorry) Our total was about $21 with drinks
GO THERE!"}
{"text":"WOW! I'm not a fan of the other Hawaiian food place and was reluctant to try this one. Glad I did took a family of 5 there we all got something different.  Everything was amazing. Went back 2 days later and got the Fire Chicken again. Soooooo good. Service is a little slow but I thing will get better when the get more kitchen staff. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I got the Katsu and bbq mix. Everything was great! Bbq chicken excellent, grilled perfectly so tasty. Katsu great! Beef was phenomenal !!! Dangerously close to home!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy some good Hawaiiaj BBQ and this place nailed it. The beef and chicken were marinated and grilled perfectly, not overly dressed. Some places tend to serve a blob of beef which is not very enjoyable. The sides that came with the meal (rice, macaroni salad, and steamed veggies) were all good as well. They were quick with getting the food out as well. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I had the Big Island Fire Chicken and my girlfriend had the Fried Fish. We also had the crab Rangoon. The entrees were amazing. The crab Rangoon was the best crab Rangoon we've had. The staff were nice and courteous as well. They also gave us coupons and a menu, so we will definitely be coming back and adding this restaurant to our favorites."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Big Island Hawaiian BBQ opened up a location. So far the best local food, portion and taste wise I've found. Kind of bummed they don't have laulau though.

We went in on a Sunday and it was busy and we ended up waiting about 15min for our food. We didn't mind because the food was fresh and worth waiting for. I ordered the katsu and bbq plate and my husband had the short ribs. My girls shared an order of spam musubi (2 in one order). The portions were large and enough to have the leftovers for dinner. The flavors were good and I will agree with the other yelpers who said they have the best Mac salad in town.

This will definitely be our go to place for local food even though they don't have loco moco. Maybe they will add the two items that are a must in Hawaii!! Hint, hint!"}
{"text":"Thank God for some good Mac salad. Best Mac salad we had since moving to Arizona. Not all watered down like some other places. Chicken Katsu was good, the Teri chicken and beef was good, and the short ribs was huge and tasty. Can't wait to go back and try more! If there was one request, make some meat jun! Thanks for bringing a little taste of Hawaii to Arizona!"}
{"text":"First try here, and we liked it. Very clean, counters and floor are immaculate.
Counter service was efficient.
Took a few minutes to get the food, that's ok, know it was fresh cooked.
Wife got chicken katsu, was good. I had fish and shrimp. Shrimp were perfectly cooked, and crunchy, as was the fish. White rice was good.
I'm no fan of Hawaiian style Macaroni, so I won't judge it.
I guess price is in line. What's with the choose your tip, when paying, for counter service???
Seeing this more often, and it's obnoxious.
Anyway, food was very good, and they have a drive thru!"}
