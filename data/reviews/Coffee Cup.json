{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed their food! Yum! I had chicken sandwich and a strawberry smoothie. I really loved the food there. Good location, great service and very clean washroom facility."}
{"text":"I went to the Coffee Cup before it moved, the building was old, the sevice was indifferent, but it had charm.   The new restaurant in NODA  is in a very cool space .  We went in late one Saturday, it took them forever to get to us, they were out of menu items, but we still had a good time and good food.   Maybe they are more together when they are busy.   I will go again, slow service can be overlooked sometimes."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been but, when I did the experience was amazing. This place screams soul food. They use all real old style ingredients for maximum heart stopping goodness. One idea they should implement - have some defibrillators on each table - just in case your heart does in fact stop while eating this delicious cholesterol filled goodness. I felt like I traveled back in time walking into this place. The atmosphere - just great."}
