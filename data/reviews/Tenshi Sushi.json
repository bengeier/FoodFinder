{"text":"The best sushi place in Calgary. 
No other yam tempura rolls can compare."}
{"text":"This place is teeny tiny! Best to get there by 5pm when they open.  We had a group of about 7 and dominated the place.  Its a little hole in the wall type joint, nothing eye catching on the outside.  The prices were decent and we ordered a large variety of rolls and appetizers.  I really loved all the food.  The sushi was fresh and the rolls were delicious! Not too much rice. 

 Honestly I really enjoyed my meal here.  I really wanted to give a 4 star review.  However, it was really crappy service.  We got in sat down.   No one came to greet us.  One of the girls in our group got up to get us menus.  Considering this is a tiny place, there is no excuse for the bad service.  So, we had our menus.  We flagged the waitress down for some tea, and the flagged her down to order.  She never checked on us, refilled our water or tea.  Really now! There were two girls working, but they seemed to just stand in the back and ignore the customers. 

I would come back here since I loved the food.  Maybe it was just an off day for service."}
{"text":"Tenshi is my new favourite sushi place in Calgary.  The quality of the fish is excellent.  The sashimi cuts are actually too big.  The rice is good and well balanced to the fish.  

The restaurant is in a great walkable neighbourhood,  it's small and casual.  Great before a night out or a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite sushi place as they would always give you huge pieces of delicious fish. Last time i was in, i noticed the pieces of fish were cut in half as well as no substitutions for platters of sushi, i have allergies to scallops and they wouldn't change it for something else. When inquiring as to why the sushi is much smaller than before, the woman at the counter stated that the price of fish goes up every single week. No food goes up in price every week. Is that why my salad contains noodles drenched in lemon instead of actual vegetables, did the price of veggies go up every week too. Instead of doing the smart thing and charging customers more while keeping the quality of the food the same, they cut back on the portions and give you bad service. Well not my favorite place anymore."}
{"text":"Love tenshi!  Been here many times. Went here on my first visit to Calgary in 2010. Tiny restaurant but the food is delicious"}
{"text":"A good friend told me about this place.  I loved it.  Food was incredibly fresh, excellent presentation and the prices are very good comparable to others in the city.  I'd say this lands as my new fav sushi joint.  

The only issue is how small it it...but maybe this is not an issue?  I personally like a little more elbow room in restaurants.  I saw lots of take out orders - next time I'm doing take out, they're definitely hearing from me!"}
{"text":"This place is great for takeout. The prices are a little below average for Calgary (which is great), and they're extremely fast from order time to pick-up time.

Their house roll leaves a lot to be desired, but everything else I have had from here in 4 visits has been terrific.

You have to try their sashimi. Not only is it fresh and delicious, but it's huge. At $1.50 to $2.50 per piece, you're getting a great deal."}
{"text":"Great place, love coming here for lunch. The owner is nice and so is the staff, really appreciate the delicious food and awesome service!!"}
{"text":"This is a really cozy place, conveniently located and service is great! Prices are very reasonable for really fresh fish and decent rolls. They have sushi and sashimi combos that come with soup and salad as a complete meal, a fairly large variety of rolls and some specials like my favourite, the Stampeder roll. 

We discovered it on a Saturday afternoon when, after waiting for about 45 min at the Globefish we decided to look for another place and finally have that sushi dinner that we had been craving for days. All stressed out, we came into Tenshi Sushi and got a tiny table in the corner of the store; as soon as we sat down it was all peace and quiet! We ordered and were served within 15-20 minutes and ended up being a very good experience.  We are regular customers ever since."}
{"text":"Tenshi Sushi has been our go to sushi restaurant for the past few years and every time the sushi has been fresh, well prepared and tasty! The restaurant is small but cozy and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"Service was slow...had to be reminded of what I ordered (example: can you bring me my bowl of rice that goes with the teriyaki chicken?)...the food was bland...and honestly over priced...better to go to 16th avenue and eat at Shibuya or Shikiji."}
{"text":"I went with a couple friends to Tenshi for lunch. Heed the recommendations to go early, because it is small and therefore packs up quickly. I can also see why it's popular as they have some amazing lunch specials including sushi rolls, soup, and salad for under $12. 
I stuck with rolls. They have all your standard stuff, with a couple slightly different variations. The portions are generous and the three of us left stuffed for only $26 including tax/tip.
Will be putting Tenshi on my sushi roster from now on."}
{"text":"We ordered a Shark fin salad. This was disgusting! You can taste that it was \"out of the package\" jelly fish. Yuck! The jelly fish tastes like plastic and it was super crunchy.  It was more spicy than expected, and there were too much sesame seeds in the salad.
The lemon didn't help the taste either, just a TINY bit of lemon managed to cover ALL the taste of the salad, I think it made the salad even worst! Maybe because it was \"out of the package\" jelly fish.  This may be the WORST salad I have ever tasted!  I will never order this at Tenshi Sushi again

Gyu Tataki

This was actually decent. However, in comparison to the other restaurants, Sukiyaki House has the best beef tataki. The sauce was rather salty though. Overall, I liked this dish.

We ordered a few sushi and a few rolls. The Unagi was rather rough, but it tastes pretty good. Daywit's unagi was burnt, but mine was ok. The toro was really fishy, I could barely finish it...the reason why I never liked tuna was because of this taste. But if the tuna were really fresh, they don't have that strong fishy taste to it. Sushi Club has amazing toro, it doesn't taste too fishy and it melts in your mouth.  Literally.  The special scallop was amazing though, it made me want to order more. That was the second best special scallop I've ever had. The best was from El's, it was big and tasty. For Tenshi's, the scallop was fresh, there's not too much mayo, the rice wasn't too much. For the shark fin sushi, it tasted exactly like the salad, yuck.
As for the rolls, the caterpillar looks like the El's one, but the flavour isn't enough. The flavour of the caterpillar roll was really bland, no flavour standing out. The other roll is the spicy tako roll. The Spicy-ness was super over powering. However, the tako was amazingly soft! You can bite right through it when you're eating the sushi.

This place was horrible! The service was bad, the sushi wasn't all that great either. How did I hear about this place? My friend told me that it was pretty good. That was a little while ago, maybe that's why...sighh
I'm glad Daywit and I didn't order our regular amount. The service was so bad! The restaurant is so small, there's only 5-6 tables, there were around 15 people in the restaurant. She BARELY filled our water, NEVER asked how everything was, and doesn't clean the tables UNTIL there's something for our table from the kitchen. There were a lot of time when she had nothing to do but she just stands at the till and stares into space. Not going to be going back to Tenshi Sushi. Sorry.

{"text":"My favourite calgary sushi. 

That being said, I never order the actual sushi- I stick the the veggie offerings (of which there are tons). The taro maki, inari nigiri and the confusingly elusive oshinko are must haves. Any tempura is also a safe bet. Not greasy, perfectly crisp and cooled apporiately as to not sog up your rolls.

Reservations are a must but they'll usually take them on the same day. Looses 1 star for never picking up the phone to make said reservation (seems caddy, but it is seriously annoying. Get voicemail people)."}
{"text":"Pros:good portion, very decent price for what you get, good variety on the menu
Cons: quality of sashimi and rolls are average and not that fresh"}
{"text":"Consider me convinced!
I've been to Tenshi twice now and I realized upon my second visit that this is the perfect Japanese restaurant. What I like about it is that it's intimate, small, cozy, quiet, cheerful, colourful, woodsy and has nice details. I was really upset when the Take 10 Cafe disappeared and Tenshi moved in. I lament no longer. With only about 7 tables and two counter seats, it's small but filled with dark wood, bright paper lanterns, traditional noren (curtains) and having lived in Tokyo, I delight in their Japanese ceramic cups, teapots and plates. 

We started with the agedashi tofu (sans bonito flakes) which needed a lil more sauce but is a nice quantity, nicely done and the most reasonable in Calgary at $3. We followed that with an adventurous Gyu Tataki, only slightly seared thin strips of beef served on pebbled ice with stringy onions and a dipping sauce. For a girl who eats her steak medium well, I actually enjoyed this as it was the meat equivalent of sushi. A must for meat lovers. The spicky sake (salmon) roll is an enigma to me with its chili which causes a wonderful spice I have not had before. The eel & avocado roll was yum and the mango tango roll (tempura shrimp, mango and avocado) is just sheer ambrosia and simply stunning to look at. I also did my usual piece of nigiri salmon and it was one of the best pieces I've had. Oishi desu! (delicious!)

TOTAL thumbs up on Tenshi. I feel really at home there and it's wonderfully priced...far below other fusion places. There's some interesting things on the menu too such as Sushi Pizza. A wonderful addition to Kensington!"}
{"text":"I hope everyone writes 1 star reviews on this place so that way Gilchrist won't discover it, write a 5* review on it, and sluts to k-town like me won't get jaded by the lineups out the doors that occur every f'n hour. Look at what Gilchrist (bless his well intentioned heart) did to Globefish!

I like Japanese cuisine but I really like raw fish on rice in a nice setting. This place delivers. The value is very good although I am on the fence whether the fish is fresh or farm raised. The rolls are not very inspired. Half of them try to be Japanese yet western, yet the other half cater to our (bland) sensibilities. Places like this need FOCUS, y'know, either all inspired by western ingredients (which pretty much rules fish all fish other than trout out) or going 100% hard core 'KONBANWA GOIZAMAS!' overzealous Japanese waitress girl who opens the menu for you style Japanese service and (therefore) food (which is like creating a business model that involves swallowing gasoline: a few freaks will show up to witness this disaster, but your top business will go to japanese village or some bull shit.) This place, considering how intimate it is, should focus on something instead of trying to cater to the usual canadian lowest common denominator. Yet again, it's easy to yell about this while having zero restaurant management experience. This being said, it's a good place to get good sushi.

 There were 2 of us and we went for a sushi binge which involved 50 large pieces of sushi, 2 Asahis for $60 plus tip. I (6'5'', 210lbs) had to take 15 pieces home which made for a VERY delicious and filling lunch. Considering how everything in Calgary is a rip off, this is a very good value. 

On my second visit during lunch, my friend and I went for a very generously portioned bento that was $11 each. 

Each time, there was good service, and this remains my favorite sushi place in town, including Towa, because Towa is f'n expensive, as slightly superior it is.

I am by no means a huge Japanese food connoisseur. On Japanese sophistication, I am 2.5/5, the .5 because I actually like trying weird and new types of food (like cute lovable dolphin!). If you're hardcore about sushi, I'd go with Vanessa's review because I'm happy with mercury-poisoned salmon on minute-rice saturated with grainy wasabi."}
{"text":"Tenshi is a great sushi restaurant! Their lunch specials include a soup and salad. For soup, there is your choice of miso or egg dropped. I went with the egg dropped and it had a delicious chicken broth  with crab, green onion, chicken, and egg. The salad was pickled noodles with cucumber garnished with a lemon. My lunch special, which was under $12, included a california roll, salmon roll, and dragon roll. Enough to fill you for sure. It's quite small and the atmosphere is very casual."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think that the smaller a restaurant is, the better quality food and service you will receive. Tenshi is a great example! As a side note, when my husband and I go for sushi, we eat the real stuff (not just California rolls and Avocado rolls), so please keep this in mind when reading my reviews.

- Reasonable prices
- Cozy atmosphere
- Quality fish
- Good service

In particular, I'd like to talk about Inari Nigiri or tofu cakes. I don't usually eat this, but Tenshi Sushi's version definitely made this particular dish one of my favourites! Tenshi's Inari was not overly sweet and contained sushi rice, black sesame seeds and fresh slivers of cucumber. Yum! It was quite a hefty and delectable dish compared to the Inari I ordered from Sushi Ichiban on McLeod trail... ack, too sugary with barely any rice inside.... and no sesame seeds or cucumber! 

We also ordered Tuna & Salmon don and although the fish was fresh, the rice was a bit too dry for my liking. I won't knock off a star for this because their sushi pieces were just too good.

I was not a fan of the sketchy tenant-shared restroom which is located just behind the kitchen area in the unglamorous guts of the building."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi and great prices. The combos have generous portions. Location is great. The place however is very small and can be a wait to get seated and service is not the best, some servers do not speak english well and orders get mixed up but overall great food!"}
{"text":"Abnormally tough/fishy sushi. The gyozas had an unusual aftertaste and even the rice on the sushi rolls were tough and hard."}
{"text":"Take out or dine in, this place hits the spot.

Have been coming here for a while now, mostly for take out but dining in is good too. The place is small, like others have mentioned but it's cozy and nice. It's a good place to meet a friend for a bite. Just that kind of relaxed atmosphere. 

The service is always quick, take out is usually ready for pick up in 20 minutes but it probably depends on what/how much you order. Dining in, this place is smooth sailing. Dishes come out quick but it doesn't feel rushed. 

We always get edamame, and their unagi is off the hook.  I also love the rolls, not too much rice and everything is always the perfect temperature - so delicious. 

Consistency - quality of eats and service - is probably what keeps us coming back.

Review #2 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"At Tenshi Sishi size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it. Tenshi is small with maybe a handful of tables. The \"bar\" can seat 2 people tops. However, what it lacks in size it makes up for in both food and proportions. 

I though the sushi was very good. The fishy half of the sushi combo I found  delectable. What was surprising is that the pieces are quite large. Though this is usually a sign of bad quality sushi, Tenshi's fish impressed me. That being said, I don't think the rice that accompanied the sushi was great. After all Su-Shi means vinegar rice and what puts a good piece of sushi over the top is a wonderful vinegar rice punch ... at least in my opinion.

I found Tenshi's atmosphere, service and food fun and enjoyable. It isn't the best sushi I have ever had, but it does well and is reasonably priced. This would be a 3.5 star place for me, but round up for a good Chu Toro!"}
{"text":"Every Saturday afternoon deserves some well-prepared Sushi and on that note, I was happy with our experience at Tenshi. 

The restaurant is cute and the server was very sweet. 
We ordered a few rolls and some nigri during our visit and when it arrived to our table I was pleased to see how fresh and well prepared it was.

There are so many options on the menu that I didn't get the chance to try - so I will be going back for more in the future.

Accolades to Tenshi!"}

{"text":"Even though the restaurant was about to close the hostess was very kind and accommodating. The service is excellent. 

I had the sushi lunch special. There were a variety of rolls, all tasty, pretty standard for sushi. 

We also ordered a special mango roll and it was AWESOME... I'm obsessed with mango so I'm a bit biased. But it was mango on top with avocado and tuna and something crunchy in the middle. I love the mix of textures and mango on top. mmm mm. 

Great value too, everyone was pretty stuffed with their $12 lunch specials."}
{"text":"I'm not picky, I'll even eat some 2.99 express California roll in a pinch. Having grew up in Vancouver though and being spoiled by good sushi, its hard to find something similar elsewhere. (not specific to Calgary, I've been in Toronto for a long time!)

This place was recommended to me by a friend for a great casual sushi joint not like miku in Vancouver level. \"This is the closest you'll get to Vancouver-tier sushi in Calgary!\" and he was right! Maybe not about the ONLY place by all means I'm sure there are other places in town but this place does remind me of sushi back home - Big, fresh, generous pieces of fish, good fish to rice ratio in their rolls, and great value. Got the deluxe platter for two and for ~20 each we had so much sushi! So stuffed with yummy goodness. 

Will definitely be back many many times before I leave this great city."}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Decided to check this out for lunch after my bf discovered it while he was walking around in Kensington. Compared to other sushi places in Calgary, Tenshi is on the bottom of my list. We both got lunch specials which range from $10-$12; I got the sushi and sashimi lunch combo and he got the teriyaki beef or chicken/tempura/sashimi combo. 

Like most Japanese places the lunch combo comes with miso soup and salad. The soup was alright, a tad bit salty but I liked it because it was full of tofu and seaweed which is what I like in my miso soup. The salad was horrible! Instead of greens, they give you vinegar soaked cellophane noodles with cucumbers on top which had a very 'off' taste. I decided to stop eating it in case I paid for it later with a trip to the toilet. When my sushi/sashimi came I was quite disappointed. It came with 5 pieces of sashimi: 2 tuna which wasn't fresh and tough to eat (ideally it should melt in your mouth), 2 salmon, and a scallop; and 4 other dinky pieces of nigiri-zushi: red snapper, shrimp, roe (fish eggs), and shiromi (white fish). The nigiri had so little rice, literally about the size of a loonie and tasted plain (it should have a sweet vinegar taste from the addition of sushi vinegar). Like some places I've been to, I thought I would be getting at least one california roll or cucumber roll. Totally not worth the ~$11.25!

My boyfriend's combo came in a bento box, and I've definitely had way better; I really enjoy the lunch bento boxes at Shibuya which costs just about the same at Tenshi but is of better quality. The teriyaki beef was way too salty, overcooked, and the meat was of poor quality (very chewy, rubbery, and chopped up into small pieces). The tempura was just OK as my bf puts it. The shrimp was over-battered, but I did like the yam tempura which was lightly battered, nice and crispy.  

The service was quite good, our server came by to take our finished dishes away and refilled our glasses when it was running low. The restaurant itself is small with about 6-7 tables, hardwood floors, and cute lanterns above each table. The cost of the sushi here is the average price you find in Calgary, but the size and quality of it doesn't justify the price. Then again..  it is run by Chinese people and not Japanese.

Overall, I've had wayyyyyyyy better in Calgary and I definitely won't be coming back. I'm going to assume the assorted sushi you can pick from was of same low quality as the sushi I had for lunch, and I suggest you skip this place for someplace better. Now that i think of it, I feel kind of jipped and wish I had tried the other lovely cafes in Kensington."}
{"text":"Tenshi is that tiny sushi place in Kensington.  It's a pretty small venue (some would say \"intimate\"), with a well decorated and dimly lit ambiance.  Tenshi is good sushi.  Best edemame I've had recently (forgot the photo).   

As should be reasonably apparent, I've been to a fair few sushi restaurants of late.  I've noticed that some of these restaurants have \"Do it Yourself\" menus, which are lists of menu items that diners are meant to use to mark/tally/record their order.  Fine.  Tenshi has a sushi list (i.e. only the sushi is on the list), which doesn't actually reflect the whole menu.  When we ordered, there was a little confusion as some of the order was \"list based\" and some was \"menu based\".  The waiter came back once or twice to verify what we'd ordered and I'm reasonably certain that something was inadvertently substituted.  Oh well.  The food was good and I really had no complaints... more of a pet peeve.

In any event, I ordered edemame, salmon sashimi, tuna maki and avocado/asparagus maki.  The vegetarian rolls were a little loose, which was likely because they were of the \"rice on the outside variety.  My friend ordered the smoked salmon sashimi salad.

Tenshi is a \"strong good\"."}
{"text":"So before Tenshi Sushi was a Japanese hangout, it was small family owned cafe that served the best Curly Fries in Calgary (no joke) for over 15 years and holds many fond memories of my parents and I having brunch each Saturday when I was a kid.
 
Now that my parents have Separated and my fathers has taken ill and can no longer walk I try to remember the good days and when life was less complicated.

So Coming into a renovated, painted and completely different atmosphere it was very odd but also therapeutic. The owner seated me next to the cashier a paper wall divided me from seeing into the kitchen. And because it was a lunch hour they had a special menu that offered 6 different hot plate options and 1 sushi assorted plater. 

I choice their sushi/Sashimi menu instead.

Here are my findings:
Salmon roll 5/5
Kappa roll (cucumber) 5/5
Dynamite roll 4/5 (Roe is green & orange)
Smoked salmon roll (they forgot)

I will definitely give them a 2nd chance. By the way I love their paper lantern lights."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of casual sushi joints and Tenshi fits in that category perfectly. It is a small joint in Kensington with a very casual ambiance. I believe they can only fit around 20 guests. 

The menu has all of the standard rolls and sushi. In addition to miso soup and sea weed salad, we ordered a variety of roles and sashimi with a focus on scallop rolls. All of the items are very cheap compared to other sushi joints in town and what I really liked on the menu was the fact that you can order sashimi by piece.

 It took them a while to take our order and generally during the dinner it was not easy to get hold of the staff.  Also the wait time for the food to arrive was very long. So be prepared to spend a lot of time time sitting hungry. However, the food is excellent. I really enjoyed every item. My favorite roll was the red kamikaze (Scallop and Tuna).  The sashimi is fresh and tasty. I highly recommend the tuna belly. The least favorite item for me was negitoro (Tuna belly and green onion roll). 

Total bill for two including a lot of rolls and sashimi in addition to appetizers was 45 which is very reasonable . 

I will defiantly go back there in future, it is a mall restaurant so reservations are highly recommended. Next time, you are looking for a casual sushi joint, Tenshi can be a very good option."}
{"text":"The food is good, especially for the reasonable price. However, the service is horrible. My group were the only people in the restaurant so this didn't happen because the waitress was busy. I asked for my order to be on a separate plate because I was sick and didn't want to get the other people at the table sick. The waitress said OK, but then brought out my order on a separate plate, and again on the main plate (so she took what I ordered and multiplied everything by 2). When I told her that she made a mistake and I didn't want 2 orders of everything, she said that she was sorry. I assumed this meant that she would take the sushi off the bill because 1) I didn't order it and 2) No one ate it. When I went to pay, I noticed that I was charged for both the orders and when I told her that I never asked for 2 orders of everything, she said that it was already  made and refused to take the second order off the bill."}
{"text":"A sushi place in Calgary that is decent, not overpriced and doesn't break the bank. Finally!

Been looking for a casual sushi joint here in Calgary for the past 8 months since moving here from Vancouver, so I'm glad that I finally came across Tenshi Sushi.

This place is a bit small so if you have a large group, good luck. Reservations are recommended. We ordered a variety of different rolls and they were all delicious. Best yet, the bill came out to $22 for the two of us. What a steal.

Didn't get a chance to try the sashimi, but it looked delicious based on what other tables were ordering.

Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Parking is difficult here. The Unagi and a surf clam are good but avoid the beef tataki. On the plus side, the salmon portions are generous."}
{"text":"If there were a word like quaint, but that incorporated good food and nice decor with being small rather than just being cute with being small, that would be the word to use for Tenshi.

I was here with a group of 5 and we took up half the restaurant... okay maybe a third. But seriously, it's small! Considering the size of the restaurant, the staff do an amazing job of keeping the noise level down! There's a big open window into the kitchen which could be troublesome, but it's not. I don't think the kitchen staff said a single word to each other the entire time we were there. Maybe they've got their own sign language? They didn't even have a radio playing. Colour me impressed! This contributed a great deal to keep a zen-ish atmosphere about the place.

Tenshi gets the title of 'The First Place I've Ever Tried Sake.' I have nothing else to compare it to, so can't say if it was good sake or not, but it tasted good to me. It was a warm, but not hot, and tasted slightly sweet. 

The rolls we ordered were made fresh on the spot. My favourite one this time around I think was this yummy little roll with cream cheese, avocado and salmon (I think). 

Only downside was after we ordered a second round of rolls. We only wanted 3 more, but they took awhile to make it out to us. It wasn't enough though to stop me from giving them four stars.

Tenshi Sushi... you make good sushi!"}
{"text":"Sashimi quality is great! Sizes are very large
Small area for seating. 
To go orders can take a long time.
Rolls are not delicious.

We order there for sashimi to go and pick up rolls from globe fish"}
{"text":"We were eating here regularly because they sushi fish is very good quality until they gave me a dish that had wasabi that they recycled from somebody else's plate, complete with chopstick holes and fish roe.  The waitress actually admitted \"that they sometimes do that.\"  Gross.

It's a shame because they were our favorite sushi restaurant in the city.  They source out excellent fish.

Their health inspection reports on the city of calgary website show that they get in trouble for not having their hand washing sink available for use, instead filled with food, at every single visit.  This means their kitchen staff don't wash their hands.  Double gross!"}
{"text":"I am strictly reviewing this place based on their food and I believe Tenshi deserves a 5 from this sushi lover. 

My date and I ordered the deluxe platter for two and man oh man they do not cheap out. We got miso soup, ebi noodles, gyozas, tempura, 42 pieces of sushi and like 16 assorted sashimi pieces all for $40. Isn't that a great price? Anyway, I think the quality of sushi there is very high, perfect rice texture and fresh tasting ingredients. Plus the sashimi was the size of my palm, no joke. 

This place may be small, but it definitely puts some love into its food. I always appreciate more quaint, intimate places."}
