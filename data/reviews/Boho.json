{"text":"My first Speakeasy since I landed in Montreal. I loved The reference from a local Polish restaurant and then walking down the side street into it a coffee shop with a hidden bookcase. The inside has kind of a tropical feel to it. The wait staff is friendly and accommodating and the drinks are interesting. Supposedly there is a speakeasy within the speakeasy that is Mezcal focused but that isn't open until the end of September so I won't get to try it."}
{"text":"This review is for clandestino the speakeasy bar down the steps. If you're a mezcal or tequila fan this is a most. Service is great too. I only take away a star because it's super expensive."}
{"text":"Same owners of Venice - introduce this sister site with the same west coast/Hawaiian theme going on. They have their fruit bar/Popsicle popup in the front - as you walk past it you get into Boho.
 
It's a small venue, which was rather nicely decorated. A couple of elites and myself were seated at the back. We came only for drinks. Our server explained the drunk menu and signature cocktails that started at 12$ and included a frozen fruit bar. I loved the idea of a Popsicle in my drink so I ordered their rendition of a mojito - Berry maitai-which included a fruit bar- the taste of biting into frozen mint and limes in my mouth was unpleasant and too tangy! Although they had better options like the coconut fruit bar that came with the  Miami vice. 

Overall, not crazy about this place- Fits into the typical Poké theme hangout. Surfs down."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with good service but the drinks were only okay. I will say the humus was very good and overall vibe was nice."}
{"text":"Boho is a really fun and cool speakeasy bar behind an ice cream parlour !!!! They have some really amazing and creative cocktails not just your classic old fashioned. The signature cocktails have a popsicles in them and are very pretty :) ambiance is casual with beach vibe perfect for a fun night out"}
{"text":"Awesome fruity cocktail made with fresh fruits and herbs.  I had a watermelon margarita and another fruity berry drink.  The bartender that made out drinks was beyond cool I wish I could remember his name.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times, they have excellent drinks! The ambiance is nice makes you feel like you're in California. Can't wait to come here in the winter. 
You should get their mescal drink, can't remember the name but its dope!"}
{"text":"Fun summer decor that takes you away to copa cabana, refreshing drinks, delicious and cheap bar food and super friendly wait staff. A great hole in the wall bar."}
{"text":"Truthfully I never got inside this speakeasy. Why? Well, when we arrived, the person at the door said the wait would be 15 minutes for our group of 2. Five minutes later, a group of 10 walk in, and the same person said the wait would be 15 minutes.. 
I was offended when after waiting for 10 minutes, he led the group of 10 in even-though we were in line before. Go figure! Left a bad taste in my mouth so yes, I won't be returning, sorry!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place and I, of course, google searched it and was pretty intrigued at the design concept. I didn't even look at the menu/cocktails. Upon arrival, I was quite impressed with their execution. At first I could not find the place for my life and my gps said I was there, but with further investigating, it's a 'hidden' gem. Excellent staff, very catering, busy, bustling place. For young, or for even older professionals, you are sure to enjoy this place and their most exquisite cocktails, and knowledge regarding their alcohol. I was given quite a tequila lesson! Head downstairs to find a tequila/mescal only bar. A bit pricier downstairs but well worth a VIP feel night with purely great liquor and the art of their presentations."}
{"text":"Un quatre étoiles qui sera probablement éphémère.. 

Ah les speakeasys, on ne s'en lasse pas ! Et c'est ce pourquoi les propriétaires du Venice MTL, juste à côté, ont également décidé de se lancer dans la machine.

Le décor est senblable à celui du Venice, version nuit : des palmiers, de l'éclairage en néon très pinterest, du blanc, des petites lampes.  Bref, on ne réinvente pas la roue, mais ça reste cute. 

Lors de notre passage, j'ai dégusté un drink aux baies et mon ami y est allé pour celui avec de la chartreuse. Nous avons beaucoup aimé ! C'était frais, et la portion était juste. Les prix des drinks tournent autour de 12-14$. Le service était très gentil, drôle et attentif. 

Overall, c'est un bon endroit pour prendre un verre. Mais ce n'est pas très original. Selon moi, il s'agit vraiment d'une saveur du moment qui va durer le temps d'un été, et on aura rapidement envie d'essayer autre chose."}
{"text":"I went there for a drink with some friend, the service was great, the waiter explained the signature drinks and gave good advices. I took a cocktail with rum, coconut and pineapple with a coconut Popsicle in it, it was great super refreshing. There is a nice vibe in the restaurant, the decor is great but I did thought that the music was too loud."}
{"text":"This place is true to its name. Absolutely loved the boho vibe! The staff is very friendly as well. They served us drinks while we waited for our table."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars for the food that comes from Venice which I enjoy (some of it, not all, the shrimps poke seem to be made from frozen shrimps or something as the texture of the shrimps was very pasty)

I first came here to go to Clandestino downstairs, which was a quick visit because we were bar hopping. The hostess was a little \"strange\", had a condescending kind of attitude when we asked \"hi! Where is Clandestino?\" I shrugged it off because I figured maybe she was having a bad night and well, we all do sometimes

This time however, as Venice was full house, we came over to Hobo to have dinner. At the door, we were greeted by the same hostess as last time, now at coat check.

\"Greeted\" is hardly the word. She asked us to leave our (light spring) jackets. We didn't want to because we didn't think it was neccesary and her attitude was quite unpleasant. Already, there was no friendliness in the air, and the demand \"u have to leave your jacket\" speech is less than thrilling (ANYWHERE, not just here) Then there was a little bit of hostility \"u will have to keep your jackets on u at all time, ppl always get hot inside but you won't be able to take them off\" with lots of I'm-telling-you kind of face

Im not being difficult here, I assure you. We were four people and we all felt it strongly. I came very close to leaving but didnt want to be an annoyance to my friends so we proceeded inside.

Once more, the host at the door asked us to leave our jackets, I said \"No I am keeping it on me\" and he didn't say anything else, just simply led us inside. (Insert confused face) 

The place is well decorated. Same as Venice, in term of style. Because it is a bar, it is much louder and darker. We got our food, the waiter mixed up my order but I was ok with eating what they made instead & because he was nice about it. My friend had to ask for him to check the wine because the glass smelled really funky. That's ok, human error, he was very helpful and pleasant about it so it was awesome.

When we left, the hostess was now very nice \"how was your dinner? Very glad to have had you with us!\" Really? Because that's how you should make customers feel BEFORE entering your business, not AFTER you've made them decide that they are never setting foot into the place again."}
{"text":"I went their with a group of my friends to have a girl's night out. I loved the place. It has a unique ambience with perfect musoc playing in the background. The cocktails were perfect. The place was jam packed that night, and even then the service was quick and attentive. In addition, I loved the food - fresh, tasty and wholesome. I am definitely going there again and again."}
{"text":"This place is nice. I don't really find it's a speakeasy though. I mean yes it's behind what looks like a food takeout place but the door to the bar is wide open and it's not very hidden.

I showed up early at 6:20 pm and by 8 pm I think it was pretty packed. I had the Gjelina pizza. It's on flatbread and has prosciutto, arugula,  mozzarella and balsamic  vinegar. It was good ! It really tasted like balsamic vinegar though so if you don't like the taste don't order it. My friend had the salmon poke bowl but replaced the salmon with tofu. It was a big portion. I didn't get the poke bowl because I had already tried it at Venice next door and it's the same. 

The first cocktail I had was the Miami vice. It's not like the on the Ies you drink in Mexico at a resort. It had  rum, guava juice, like juice, coconut pieces and a slice of pineapple. There was also a coconut popsicle inside. Next time I would eat the popsicle first because i waited till the end of my drink and the popsicle was melting fast! It tasted good though.

Next I had the clandestino cocktail. It had mezcal with passion fruit nectar, simple syrup and sparkling lemonade. 

Then I had the basil smash cocktail. At first I didn't like it because it was very bitter but once I mixed it it grew on me.  The more I drank it the more I liked it. The cocktail contained vodka, gin, lime juice, ginger and cucumber. 

The service was good. My friend asked the waiter what sweet drink he recommended and he recommended the peach pisco sour but it wasn't sweet at all. So she returned it and the guy gave her the same drink for free and it turned out that the bartender was missing the key ingredient to make it sweet and it was actually good. 

I think this would be a cute date to bring a date."}
{"text":"Put this on your list of cool places to get a drink in Old Montreal right now! 

Once you enter through the takeout space that is Venice and past the sliding bookcase you'll find Boho, a beautifully decorated little bar with all the trendy items on the 'gram -large fiddle leaf plants, palm wallpaper, neon accents. 

The bartender, Julian, is a GENIUS mixing some of the best cocktails you'll taste. You'll want to taste them all! He really knows his stuff and if you are feeling adventurous, I find it fun to give him a list of inspirations and let him create a personalized drink for you! 

If you like sweet drinks, they are famous for their drinks containing one of the whole house made palletas (popsicle). Get one of those!"}
{"text":"boho is a tropical, southern california influenced bar with well made cocktails and the names to match (eg santa monica, venice beach etc) pro tip - go early if you want to sit at a table - we showed up around 930 on a thursday and there were only bar stools left."}
{"text":"Really good drinks and good service. I came here after Ribfest with some of my fellow Yelp Elites. It was a great choice for all of us to get to know each other a bit. I ordered a drink called El chapo which was somewhat spicy and smoky. It was delicious and I highly recommend it. Everyone left happy and satisfied. I will definitely return at some point."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review after having gone twice to Boho.

The first time I went, it was still a new and secret bar, and I remember it being hard to find because I went there so late. However, the mystery of it was what made it fun! We got in with a bouncer that brought us to the back of some food place (later realized it was the express Venice MTL). My friends and I grabbed delicious drinks and we checked out the speakeasy downstairs, which we found by accident and I love how private and secluded it was. We didn't stay long because it wasn't crowded that night, but I had a good first impression of this place. 

Now fast forward months later, where I went the second time for my friend's birthday at around 7:30 pm. She had called a few hours ahead to know if there was space for 10 people and they were kind enough to fit us all despite being last minute. When I got there, I noticed a lot more people than the first time I went. Walking in, I noticed how this place really sticks to their theme of tropical beach, from the wallpaper, the music, the drinks to the waiters/waitresses' outfits. The staff was nice and extremely accommodating. It's a pretty casual bar and the prices are pretty decent despite being in the Old Port. The food is the same as Venice MTL, and I had the mushroom pizza which was delicious. I must stress that the drinks are amazing, as much the first time as the second time! I had a lot of trouble deciding on which drink to get because they all sounded amazing. I finally decided on the Santa Monica which was so good, and I love the idea of a popsicle inside the drink. Throughout the night, the lights got more dim and the music got louder, which is expected for a bar on a Saturday night. However, I couldn't check out the speakeasy again since there was a private event. Although the mystery secret vibe of Boho is not there anymore, I still very much enjoyed my experience there.

I recommend to go here on any occasion and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cutesy Hawaiian/surf-themed space. Not super original but it was definitely what the doctor ordered for a chill date night: decent food and drink, intimate low-lighting, good tunes, oh and there's vegan and gluten-free options :)
While the spot overall didn't knock my socks off, I think it's a fun locale. Probably even moreso for a different clientele.

Prices were definitely reasonable for the area and cocktails; service was attentive though seemingly a little irritated (?) I don't know if that was on account of us or the loud suits beside us. Go figure.
Speaking of suits, there were a lot of them in this bar. Beware. Or go if that's your sort of thing.

While the original concept seemed to veil the speakeasy bit better, the little smoothie shack meant to cover the bar now has a large neon sign above it reading \"boho\". Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, when we entered the place the bookshelf entrance was just wide open- hardly speakeasy. Maybe they're reconfiguring the concept to be less subtle? I'd dig it more if the mystery was maintained."}
