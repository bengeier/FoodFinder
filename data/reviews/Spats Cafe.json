{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great daily specials and friendly staff.  AYCE fish on Friday is legit! Good game day specials too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Dirty, falling apart hole in the wall. Employees are rude and slow. Food comes out randomly and not all at once on top of being all frozen food thrown in a fryer. Nothing is fresh about this place."}
{"text":"Fair food very slow service
All meals not severed at same time one member of our party waited extra 10 min to get his fries"}
{"text":"2 of bartenders were very rude and do not know what they are doing! could not make a drink for the life of them! I guess they didn't mess up pouring a beer but that's hard to do! food was okay, after you leave I noticed I smelled like fried food! I would go back if they hired some real bartenders!"}
{"text":"Great place to drink and eat. Local feel with great food. My kids love to order soup and their soups are always fantastic. I love the mussels. We go here every time we visit."}
{"text":"I love the food, the wait staff and the location.  They have specials every day with special prices. Nice place to eat and meet friends and not a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Their pizza is cooked in a \"Quiznos Oven\" (waitress' words, not mine), so I wouldn't order the pizza. We sat down without being sure if it was a seat-yourself kind of place -- others seemed to be just as confused. 

Menu was typical bar food, draft list did not contain any craft beers except Dortmunder. I got the bacon cheddar burger, and it was more onion than bacon or cheddar! Very greasy, too.

I probably wouldn't come here again for food unless I was planning on downing ten Bud Lights first. Maybe then the food would taste good."}
{"text":"5 star for a dive bar.  Best bar food east of Cleveland with the best prices! They have the best deals in town and chicken parm thursdays are my favorite. Two chicken Parmesans with pasta, toast, and salad for $19. They're dressing is homemade and I always mix the hot and BBQ sauces on wings. Hands down go to place on east side!"}
{"text":"Went to Spats because they offered a coupon in restaurants.com. The environment inside was very busy with signage everywhere and the bar was crowded. The menu offered some interesting choices besides the typical burger fare. Two of our party of four ordered the lasagna and the other two ordered the strip steak. The wait wasn't very long and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. The lasagna was excellent and came in a large portion. The toasted bread that came with it was just OK. The strip steaks were very tender and tasty with hardly no fat or gristle. The waitress was very attentive, energetic and friendly. All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"It's a bar that serves food!!!! When I go here I'm not looking for a 5 star restaurant. I want a burger and labatts on draft, they deliver. I enjoy going here , talking to staff and relaxing.  They make a big boy burger that's amazing"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. Bartender is amazing and has been there for years. You can go in your sweats or Friday night attire. Owners always on site and very friendly. One of the best and most personable places around."}
{"text":"Great food at fantastic prices. Affordable drinks and fast friendly service.  Totally relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good. We love that we can both find something we like in the menu, from burgers to pasta to pizza to entrees and salads. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Especially love the veal Parmesan and the tuna melt and grilled chicken. I even asked for pasta Alfredo one night. It wasn't on their menu but the cook made it anyways and it was incredible. They go out of their way to serve you a good meal and all the waitresses are nice. Highly recommend."}
