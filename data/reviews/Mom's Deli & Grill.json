{"text":"They have one of the best gyros you will ever eat! They have great food and are very friendly. My family and I usually get take out from here once a week! Defiantly would recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I haven't been to Mom's Deli in a while but can only rate it as \"average\" from previous experiences there. I can't say the place is dirty or the staff unfriendly but it's just average. Mom's is, without question, the closest restaurant to our home so you would know that it's not noteworthy when we will travel further. We have probably used the take out service more than the dine-in and again without any complaints or fanfare. I do prefer smaller locally owned restaurants to chains but I think there are nicer places with similar food but better value and value is what I base my ratings on. Not a horrible place, not a great place... just \"average\" deserving of an average 3 star rating."}
{"text":"A gem of a  restaurant.  We're not from the area and we searched out a family owned breakfast diner and found the perfect spot for breakfast and more!  Perhaps the low ratings come from locals that want to keep this jewel a secret.   Great food, good price and top end service.  Glad we found Mom's!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the greatest, quicker, cheapest restaurants in the area.  After Church, it's a great quick place to eat.  The service is fantastic and everyone there is so friendly.  It seems as though the employees were trained to talk to their customers and be friendly.  Everyone should try here and not just pass it up...GREAT place to eat :)"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars but I'm I nice guy so I'll round up. Been coming here at least once a month for the past 18 years and the sheer nostalgia is hard to get past but this is the most honest review could muster. Love the food and all the options, but some of the options can get a little pricey. Nice family joint with very pleasant staff and pretty good food."}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. This is what they call a perch diner. What they served was glorified fish sticks. The potato dumpling soup had one potato in it and the fries were soggy. The only saving grace was the coleslaw. I would be embarrassed to serve this to a customer. I would recommend many of the other family owned restaurants if you want a decent meal."}
{"text":"First time there and I just had to walk out. Staff was rude and made me feel like I did not exist and my business did not matter to them .  Will never return."}
{"text":"As a family style restaurant they do a good job! This type of restaurant I judge by its service, cleanliness, price point and most importantly food quality. My first visit was on a Sunday at ten thirty in the morning. It was packed but only took a moment to be seated. The service was really good. The busser backed the server well and provided a comfortable experience. The food came out fast and was freshly prepared. The food quality was what you would typically expect at a family style restaurant. Remember this is not a chef driven kitchen, it's short order. The hashbrowns were done well, not dry at all, with saut√©ed onions mixed in. You could tell they made them in house not frozen from a bag. The corned beef was sold as \"made in house\" and it was decernably so, and good I'd add. The only drawback, and I'm being a little picky here, we're the eggs. At a short order breakfast place the cook should be able to temp the egg like a grill chef temps a steak; over-easy should have a runny yolk and a slightly loose white around it, over-medium a white that cooked through with the edge of the yolk starting to tighten. Our two plates had the eggs over-easy. I had to be a bit picky to find anything off about the place. Lastly, despite the Sunday bustle it was clean and orderly in the kitchen (I took a peak while checking out) as well as the dining room. At less than $8 per person it was well worth the visit.  I look forward to trying one of their corned beef sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great comfort foods!!! Nice waitress staff. Clean place. There is always plenty of parking and this place does beat out the fast food places. It's a great sit down lunch location."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. Great food and great service. I frequent this establishment regularly and they never disappoint. They have a great selection and large portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ehhhh....  Food is pretty good,  I don't really have anything bad to say, but it just seems a little overpriced and for some reason the atmosphere seems a little sterile. Again, no complaints,  this place just isn't for me. It was clean, and the food tasted good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been wanting to try this place out for a while, so today was the day.  We were seated quickly, the waitress was very friendly, and our food came out quickly also.  But......I was not impressed with their corned beef hash.  There were more potatoes than corned beef, and the corned beef was in thin slices that were fairly large........that's not hash!  It was basically hash browns with a few slices of corned beef and some onions thrown in.  My boyfriend's three egg sausage and cheese omelet was pretty packed with sausage, but the omelet itself looked like an egg crepe, so they probably use three small eggs for their omelets, though he said that it was still filling overall.  Nothing impressive at all, so we probably won't be going back, at least not for breakfast.  And.......the prices are higher than on the menu posted on zmenu.com, by at least a dollar for most of them.....just an FYI."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had, home fries were definitely the best yet! Service was a little slow but to be expected on a Sunday morning for breakfast! I'll definitely be back to see how lunch and dinner are!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the low ratings, but I have only been here once so maybe I was lucky. Had a gyro omelette and he wife had a standard breakfast, both good. Service was decent and the place clean. Will try again if our regular is too crowded, as it was today."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast this morning...we love this place and make it a point to stop when we are nearby. We both went with our favorites...mine is mom's hash and eggs and hers is mom's breakfast sandwich with home fries. The food was excellent as usual...I'm mad at myself because I had already desecrated my hash and eggs before I could take a picture...but I guess I couldn't wait. The service was a little laid back but we were in no hurry. Would definitely recommend for a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I travel a lot and revisit the really good places. Not sure if I will search for it next time I am in the area. This is not a knock on this nice restaurant, it just isn't my type. You should try it at least once if you haven't."}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service! On my way back from an adventure day in Brunswick I was starving for some good greasy diner food, and this place hit the spot! I just got a regular bacon cheeseburger and fries, it was a perfect patty, big enough to fill me up but not overwhelming, the fries were seasoned just perfect.

My husband got the corned beef sandwich, which he said was some of the best corned beef hes had in the cleveland area. The atmosphere here is very welcoming, homey, its definetly a local spot and they try to treat all their customers like family. Ill definetly be back because great food, service and pricing is my joy in the restaurant world!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by the number of poor reviews about Mom's.  My family and I come here every Sunday after church for breakfast, and we have never been anything but satisfied.  While it is definitely not a \"fancy\" place, Mom's feels homy and comfortable. The owner, \"mom\" greets everyone and asks us about our week and family... She's very genuine and caring. The food is very good comforting breakfast fare that tastes as if your own mother cooked it for you.  I always order the old fashion which is eggs, a meat (mmmmm bacon!), home fries, and toast or a bagel. It's delicious and filling so you don't need lunch later, and everything on the breakfast menu is very inexpensive (less than $4 for the whole meal). I really enjoy our Sunday tradition, and seeing all the rest of the \"regulars\" here every week, it seems as if others do too!"}
{"text":"We are regulars there, more take out than eat in. Ordered the fish fry and Greek salad  yesterday  for take out. The fish (walleye) was excellent, the perigees were good also, the coleslaw however was dry and bland. The Greek salad did not have the usual herbs and the lettuce was not up to par, that salad seems to being going downhill for some reason, we get it about twice a month. The staff is always friendly and phone orders are fast. We have gone there for about 5 years. The Philly steak is outstanding, so is the chicken wrap. We will be going back. kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"I love it! 
Have always had great food and great service. 
Prices are VERY reasonable and portions are more than satisfying 
Like my late Dad used to say \"different strokes for different folks\"
Can't please everybody! It would literally be impossible to try. 
I figure as long as me and my husband love it I really don't care what others think. 
Go someplace else or better yet stay home more room for me!!"}
{"text":"Great deli especially for breakfast. Attentive staff. If you're in a hurry, don't worry they're fast! Comfortable family style ambiance, quiet, great for breakfasts with the kids. Very affordable, great home style specials. Nothing fancy, but everything you'd want for prices you'll love!"}
{"text":"I am in town 4 times a year for a week at a time, and I have to eat here every day for breakfast and sometimes for lunch. The waitress remembers what we want every time we come back. The eggs are done perfect and they make a great Grilled Cheese with tomato sandwich. The fresh fish sandwich is great as well. This is a great place to take the family for either breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My meal was just awful! I ordered a gyro to go. No tomatoes or onions. No sauce! Who ever heard of a gyro with just meat. I could eat any of it. I tried to call the restaurant, but no one answered the phone Save your money and go else where."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch today. Was here for only about 30 min from start to finish. Sat, ordered, ate and tipped heavily. I like quick and friendly service when I'm on the go. This place never fails to deliver just that."}
{"text":"I love going out to breakfast, but not really here. The service is always 'meh' and it's always crowded in a bad way. Their menu isn't great, food is 'meh' also. They don't even have English muffins! There is no decor to speak of, but I guess that's typical :) basically if you are right by it, it's not the worst, it's always clean."}
{"text":"Saw the chef throw paper into my brothers mozzarella sticks while they were sitting on the food counter. Then they brought it out to the table. 

I didn't pay to have the chef throw garbage into my food."}
{"text":"We got seated quickly. I had been here before but didn't remember what I had ordered. Had the corned beef omelet wife had the skillet. The food was bland and nothing to write home about. It doesn't deserve a 1 star but also not a 5."}
{"text":"Mom's is a Deli & Grill...should I be surprised at food quality not being the greatest?  I guess not.  Service was good, but I was hoping for a more succulent taste.  Dried flaky fried fish, frozen pierogies.  The cole slaw was good and the pie looked okay.  Overall I was not satisfied.  Don't deli's cook fresh any more?"}
{"text":"Jesus christ. How many times do I have to give this place a chance and they get it wrong. I figure oh its been like a year since then, maybe it's different now. Nope. Fool me every 12 months shame on me I guess. Never, ever get our order right. Nothing special, literally order right off the menu. They screw up. Never again. 

Also, does the owner have stock in some sort of Big Onion conglomerate? I can't understand how anyone there thinks this is acceptable food. Maybe George Costanza chompin on a whole onion would love it but no normal person wants half a raw onion in a breakfast meal."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about...? The food is O.K. It's not great, it's not bad, It just... is. 

And the staff are not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Such friendly service!  Everyone goes out of their way to be welcoming.  We usually go to breakfast here on Sunday after church and the place is packed, but not overwhelmingly so.  The French toast is outstanding as is the side of gyro meat and sauce.  The omelettes are delicious too!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This local favorite is usually busy and with good reason.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  We've always gotten great service, especially if seated front and center of the restaurant.  The odd thing is getting a table.  There is no dedicated greeter so you just have to wait until a waitress who wants to seat you is free.  I have actually seen patrons wait and wait up front and finally leave.  Too bad because the food is great.  I've only been here for breakfasts.  The House omelette is probably my favorite but I do like to mix it up.  The home fries are truly great...the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food quality and quantity is above and beyond the price. Soups are homemade and always delicious. Staff is super friendly and fast. Couldn't recommend this family style restaurant more."}
{"text":"Went into this establishment one day when I was hungry for lunch.  There seems to always be a bunch of cars in the parking lot, so I thought it might not be a bad place to try out.  Walked inside and had to wait only 5 minutes for a seat.  The waitress staff at the establishment seems to prefer regulars rather than people that just walk in because it took them almost 15 minutes to come take my order.

The menu is very basic with not much variety; I decided I would try to play it safe and go with a burger and fries.  Once my order was taken, the food didn't take to long to come out.  The burger was completely bland; it tasted almost like they pulled a patty out of the freezer and grilled it without any seasoning or effort; at least the fries were half decent.

The prices at this restaurant are a COMPLETE joke only because the food is so terrible. Granted, I only went there once; however, upon telling my friends about the place, they all agreed that it was one of the worst locations for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner because of the service, price of the food, and taste.

STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this has gotten so many poor reviews! I always come here with my family on Sundays after church. The staff is always very friendly and attentive! The owner, \"mom\", always comes around and talks to everyone dining. She shows that she genuinely cares about us and the rest of her guests every week!  I usually get the old fashion, which comes with eggs, home fries, a choice of breakfast meat, and choice of a variety of toast or a bagel. If I don't order an old fashion, I order pancakes or an omelet. No matter what I order, I am never disappointed with my meal. The prices are definitely not going to break the bank- around $4 or less per meal!"}
{"text":"For the price and the nice friendly service, I'll give it a better rating. I think I may have ordered the wrong thing, my parents and sis didn't think their food was too bad.

This is a neighborhood place that's opened up in the last few years. I've always driven past but never stopped by, so one weekday morning my parents took us there.

It's a cute place thats obviously mom and pops. Lotsa people come here especially for lunch. We got here a bit earlier though so we beat the big lunch crowd. They had homemade desserts in the front counter where you pay (tiramisu and cakes which looked yummy) and I think a second room in the back for seating.

I got the philly cheesesteak on croissant, which wasn't good at all. The meat was cold and smushy like it had been cooked too long originally or something. There was tons of onions on top. The overall combo didn't work at all though...hahaha...I just thought it sounded good at the time. I can't remember what my family had, but they finished it all. Prices were really good here though, and they give you good portions of food, so I might really have just gotten the wrong thing.

It's a good place to get something quick, and their menu is decently sized. For no frills food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing to rave about.  Typical greasy spoon in the suburbs with no idea of what quality is.  We had breakfast here with the family and my mom actually vomited after  we got home.  She got the pancakes and the butter on top.  

Any chain restaurant in a suburb is usually the same crap, but you would expect a mom and pop place to serve you with the utmost courteousy and customer service.  Didn't ring my bell and I live a mile away.  Driven past the place for 10 years and went in once.  By the way, most of the restaurants in North Royalton are shin digs besides Jaipur Junction.  Go out to Beachwood, Tremont, or Westlake to get proper dining."}
