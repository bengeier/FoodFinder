{"text":"Great food, great service! Never had a bad meal or experience at this restaurant in all the years we've been going here and this is the only one I can say that about. Consistently excellent food, very nice, helpful staff.  They also deliver to me miles and miles away from their restaurant! 
Highly recommend for fresh, great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Either this restaurant is close to the address is wrong. Nothing in the surrounding area named panda buffet either."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst food I've ever had! I didn't have high expectations in the first place but is there anything worse than eating cold, mass produced Chinese food? This place really deserves a fraction of a fraction of a star but stupid Yelp won't let me do that."}
{"text":"We have only eaten here for takeout. The food has always been hot and delicious! Very friendly staff and the crab rangoon is the best we've ever had! Definitely recommend them--at least for fresh takeout."}
