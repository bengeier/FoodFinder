{"text":"Great Peking Duck, love their BBQ lamb skewer. So far they haven't disappointed me..."}
{"text":"Walking in to many empty seats should've been a warning sign. The service was extremely slow and food was generally below average/very salty. We ordered the first Peking duck item. Should've ordered the second cheaper option instead. Ended up paying 7 extra bucks for a handful of craisins...even then the portion was tiny/duck was not seasoned. The lamb skewers were ok but the meat was not tender. Overall, I'd say this trip was a waste of money. Go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Peking duck tastes good. Yes, maybe that is the only one I like.
But it seems a little bit expensive .
Anyway,this restaurant is clean, because it's new. Hopefully they can keep it clean,and I will try it soon. Because they have promotion now, buy one duck and get one duck free for next time. I like this deal."}
{"text":"This part of town (Yonge and Finch/ Steeles), doesn't have many good Chinese restaurants (I think there's only a few congee places and maybe one or two others), so this is a nice change. 

The food at NCE is quite good, especially if you live in the area (saves a drive to Markham). Tried a couple of things:

-the Peking duck was nice. I believe its one of the specialities here. It's one of the better Peking ducks that I've had in Toronto 
-The skewers are okay. Not as good as other places (eg Yang's, or even 3 Guys at Yonge/ Finch), but still decent. 
-Noodles were good, and with a decent amount of meat 

If this place was in Markham, I'd probably give it 3 stars. But given the competition in the immediate vicinity, I think 4 stars is fair. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers Northern style Chinese food. We came here for Peking duck. The service was really good. During the time that we went, there was a promotion running where you could get one free Peking duck on your next visit. We were also given complimentary soft serve ice cream. I personally prefer location over the other Peking duck place (Dayali). You will tend to find their skewers to use a strong spice (cumin I believe), which might not be for some people. I didn't enjoy it as much as the others. I found that the other dishes were relatively mediocre. I would recommend gettingr the veggie dish that we ordered along with the Peking duck. 

Overall, the place has nice decor and there is greet service. You may have to park a bit further from the restaurant given how busy the plaza is.  I would consider returning for Peking Duck."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service when I ate here. The business had just opened reccently but that was no excuse for what happened. 
My family came here for dinner. The restaurant was busy but was slowing down gradually. We ordered a few items including their specialty peking duck, skewers, dessert soup, soy drinks and fried rice.
We waited for 2 hours and only got our luke warm lamb skewers and horrible dessert soup. I saw that our fried rice was given to the table next to ours as well. 
Still hungry, we asked the server about our missing dishes, she mistakenly thought we wanted the bill but not even remembering what we ordered. She was not even clear about that so we showed her a picture of our order and told her we did not get all the dishes. After she left, we were still wating for food that wouldn't come. We finally decided to leave then and called for the bill. The waiter was really surprised that we didnt get the food we ordered and said they could get it now. We told her no, we had enough. 
We left hungry and angry and to top it off our bill was incorrectly calculated as well.
We got a cupon for free peking duck however, apparently everyone was getting this. Not much of a compensation for this disaster. 
The restaurant's name has changed to chef Quan's however, I think it is still managed by the same people. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday (Feb. 13th)  to avoid the crowd during Valentine's Day (tomorrow).

Ordered:  
-the whole duck; their specialty.
-lamb skewers.
-Dan Dan noodles.

The Peking duck at, $40, is rather expensive, however, it tasted delicate.
 
The noodles & the skewers were a bit salty.
Like in most Northern-Chinese style restaurants, the Bbq is authentic and rich in Xin Jiang-style spices.

Go for the Peking duck!"}
{"text":"If you love Peking duck, you should definitely give this place a try!

Pros:
Very good Peking duck
Plenty of seats

Cons:
Other dishes just average

We spotted this place 2 weeks before Chinese New Years and thought right away we should try it out.  The place is really big with plenty of seats and was near by for us as well.  

We of course ordered the Peking duck.  A stir fried broccoli and shanghai thick noodle were ordered as well because those are some of out little one's favourites.  The dishes came out lightning fast.  It wasn't too busy at the time we ordered but it was still very quick.  The Peking duck would come a couple of minutes later.

The Peking duck here is nothing short of amazing.  It was one of the better ones I've had in the city for sure.  It's not as fancy looking as some other places, but it makes up for it with it's taste.  I have to commend whoever roasted this duck as he or she definitely knew what she was doing.  The wrappers here are much thinner than other Peking duck restaurants.  I think this is a better thing as you really taste more of the duck and fillings with every bite.  Just be sure you're using only one wrapper and not any more before you start.

The other dishes were just average and nothing to write home about.  I don't have too many qualms about that since their specialty was done perfectly.  You're going to be coming here for the Peking duck and they do an amazing one here.  

This is definitely going to be one of my go to's from now on for Peking duck.  It might be a little bit pricier than what I'm used to but it's well worth it if you ask me.  My only regret of the night was not knowing Johnny L was there at the same time I was.  LOL"}
{"text":"Food is ok..

Lamb skewers are good!!

Been here 4 or 5 times, to check them out when they were grand opening and to come back for their Peking duck special..

Took them like 4 or 5 months to get a liquor license.. So we went back to have lamb skewers with beer 

The Peking duck special doesn't really make that place cheap even tho it sounds like a deal..

For 3 people, we spent $160 over 2 separate occasions, because the Peking duck is free on the next visit.. So we had to go twice..

Usually go for the dumplings, lamb skewers, beef brisket noodles, Peking duck, cabbage skewers, and fried rice or fried noodles.. The brisket quality varies, cabbage skewers are always over seasoned, Peking duck meat is ok but the wrapper is 3.5 to 4 stars, dumplings are good..

Probably won't be going back often.. But don't kind going for a lamb skewers snack and beer.. Only cuz you're stuck going back twice within 30 days.."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I ever seen mess ups this terribad at a restaurant until dining at NCE BBQ (which stands for Northern China Eatery BBQ). 

We came here for dinner at around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. The restaurant was very well lit, and the furnishings looked very nice. It almost gave me a feeling like I was in some sort of a show room at a furniture store. The dining space was very large, and it was at most half filled at dinner time on a Friday evening. Looking around, the guests all looked very young, perhaps this is a popular spot amongst students.

So we were seated and we looked through the menus, which by the way, were re-used/worn-out paper take out menus... A bit disappointing that they don't have a proper presentable dine in menu to look at. We definitely wanted to try the Chef Special Peking Duck, since this place specializes in this dish. The print out menu listed each extra on its own \"extra bean sauce; extra onion strip; extra cucumber\" each one originally priced at $3.99, but then there were pen markings of \"0\" where the 3 was, so it looked like each extra was $0.99... later we found out that these extras are actually free. Very confusing, why not just include it in the main peking duck special...?

We started writing out our order on the small piece of paper at our table. Fifteen minutes had passed and our waiter was busy running around and still had not once checked whether we were ready to order. He was pretty much the only waiter at the restaurant and he was bussing tables too. We eventually got his attention and he took our paper...but he did not recount the items on the list to confirm what we wanted to order...which caused a lot of headaches later into our meal.

We waited ONE WHOLE HOUR for the first item to arrive at our table. We got the lamb skewers (4 skewers). The meat was not hot, but room temperature. An absolute let down that we waited one hour for the first item to get to our table to be luke warm. The taste was very strong in cumin, well seasoned, but it was just average in my opinion. We were pretty much sitting and waiting for the rest of our order again (we still had the chef special peking duck, dessert soup, fried rice with shrimp, and sweet and sour pork). And we noticed that the guests at the table near us had paid their bill and left half an hour ago but no one had cleared the tables yet. It was so disorganized and messy.

At hour and 10 minutes into our visit, we were still waiting on our soy drinks...We didn't understand what was taking so long. We asked for someone to check on this for us, apparently they didn't have enough soy drink (maybe our serve should have mentioned that to us before we ordered it). Then the lady (she looked like the owner?) gave us what they had left over for free, which I guess nice of her to do. It was still a little frustrating that we had to tell our servers to continually check our order...

So 15 minutes later after getting our drinks, the next thing that arrived at our table was the dessert soup (glutinous rice balls in osmanthus soup). The server brought a ginormous soup bowl to our table and I thought this was not what we ordered. It looked like a savoury soup for dinner for a large group. So okay, we got our dessert soup before our entrees... weird, but okay. We all tried the dessert soup and were appalled that this was called a dessert. The dessert soup was sour and smelled like vinegar!!! There was egg in this soup, so I am guessing they were making strands of egg with vinegar and poured the vinegar into the soup, like wtf. The only thing sweet was the filling in the glutinous balls, which also had black sesame inside... Needless to say we did not finish the dessert. We tried to finish the glutinous balls, but the soup was totally inedible.

At around 9:00pm we still did not have our main entrees. We waved for someone to come over to our table. The lady who got our soy drinks earlier came over and started to ask what we ordered, which is odd since we gave them what we ordered on a piece of paper. We again told her what we ordered, and told her twice that there were three items that still did not arrive at our table. She then told us the the fried rice and the sweet and sour pork was sent to the wrong table. Great, I thought. She explained that they were having difficulties with the printer/machine. Five minutes later she comes with the bill. We were charged for the peking duck chef special, extras wraps, lamb skewers, and the dessert soup. It was so weird that she gave us the bill before our main entree (peking duck chef special) had arrived. We waited for an additional 30 minutes after which we asked her where the peking duck was. She thought we finished our meal and asked for the bill. Just awful. She gave us a coupon for a complimentary NCE Chef Special Peking Duck for our next visit. We won't be coming back next time. I think our \"meal\" we had should have been free tbh."}
{"text":"Authentic  peking roast duck and northern chinese cuisine in Thornhill. Spacious,quite and friendly.10?off during newly opening period."}
{"text":"Excellent Peking Duck!  There are two options for the duck on the menu.  Both options come with pancakes, sauce, cucumber, and green onion. The only difference between the two options is an extra plate of crispy duck skins (the best part of the Peking duck).  For $3.99, you can also ask them to make a big bowl of soup with the duck bone. Very good deal. 

I tried their lamb skewers and sausage skewers. Lamb skewers were okay, but the sausage skewers were bland.  I wouldn't go to this restaurant for skewers.  

I also tried a spicy pot dish and a noodle dish.  They both were very good. 

The restaurant is located next to Sleep Country. There's an over flow parking lot at the back."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for lunch after seeing an ad for it on CCUE. I expected the restaurant to be at least pretty busy given that it was a Sunday afternoon for lunch hour, but there were only three other tables. Service was alright, the waitress finally gave us tea when my dad asked for it. We only wanted peking duck, so we got the NCE Chef's Special Peking Roast Duck ($38.99). Their menu style is similar to AYCE-ordering style, giving you a huge piece of paper to mark down what you want, but keep in mind it's not ayce lol.

I didn't expect them to give us four Korean side dishes though - kim chi included. They place the meat on a raised plate, and decorate the edges with some cucumber and carrots. There were extra little plates with seasonings and sauce for us too. It was delicious and satisfying.

They have free soft-serve ice cream for dessert! It was so good. The restaurant is a pretty spacious place, but hard to find in the plaza (look for the Dollarama). It is still a new restaurant at the time of this review, so they're doing a special BOGO coupon for their peking roast duck. The coupon is really ghetto - the woman hand-writes it only in Chinese on a piece of recycled paper, then signs it with her name and date.

Restaurant was really clean, bright, lots of nice lighting fixtures with 3 huge LED televisions. We will be back! =)"}
