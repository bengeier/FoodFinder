{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and had the Toston con pollo (combo 4). It was very good!! The empanadas are the best and the people who work here are super friendly. I can't wait to come back here again"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Finally a Colombian spot in Markham where you can get great tasting empanadas. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"La bandeja paisa estuvo muy sabrosa, especialmente el chicharron. Muy buena la comida Colombiana y en Markham, bien por esa."}
{"text":"Finalmente! Hay un restaurante Colombiano en este Barrio. Si quieres comida tipica de Colombia venga a Toston! Los jefes Christina y Alex son amistoso, personable y awesome. Porciones son sufficiente y comida de casero! Tienen especiales del dia y combos.
Tuvimos empanadas de carne, estaba may rico. Por plato principal comiamos Bandeja Paisa: carne, chrizo, chicharron, avocado, arepa, huevos con arroz y frijoles.....phew no ma's por favor lol. Para tomar, tuve gaseo se llama Postobon (manzana).
En la final, fue un buen experencia, comida casero, buen precio, porcion y servicio.
Hasta pronto mi amigos!"}
{"text":"So happy that I can finally get Colombian food without having to travel far. The owners of this resturant are so friendly and it's got such a cute vibe to it. The food is amazing and super filling. One combo was enough to fill two people up! So glad I found this place, I tell all my friends about it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Loved the fried cassava and pork belly. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"This place is really cute! I'd never had Colombian food before and decided to come and try it out. Yum!

Location:
In a strip mall plaza chocked gull of different businesses! Lots to see here

Parking:
I came after work during the week so it wasn't so bad! There were a tonne of parking
 Not sure what it would be like on the weekend though 

Decor:
It's teeny tiny and super cute! There's 5 tables inside and one outside as well as 6 or so bar seats.

The walls are red and wood and it is decorated with art and photos from Columbia. It's very cute. Things are made to order, when I was there the owner  was working. He's nice!

Food: 

I ordered the traditional Colombian big meal. Beans, sausage, steak, rice, pork belly, egg and avacado. It was ok. I don't think I'd get it again. Nothing really stood out for me as really good just ok. 

I really wanted to like it because I like finding new hidden gems. There are a lot of restaurants in the plaza that was busier. I should have realized by that and when I checked in a couple of yelp friends messaged me to tell me where to get better Colombian food."}
