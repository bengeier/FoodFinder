{"text":"The food is worth it. However if have even the slightest hunger pangs you'd up killing someone."}
{"text":"Don't bother - waste of time and the food sucks. They mashed a bunch of menu items - expensive and not even close to being worth it."}
{"text":"~I would this place a 4 but the service was extremely slow~  I took my whole family to check out Kara Mia and Desi Eh! both combined into one restaurant. One brand servers Italian cuisine and the other Pakistani Punjabi cuisine. So we got a spot and you have to order at the cashier and the food comes to your table. The cashier and server although high school kids were very friendly and happy but the kitchen staff was quite slow in sending the food out.   We ordered a bunch of dishes:  Fettuccine Alfredo - Fettuccine in a rich creamy garlic and parmesan sauce. This was not bad and we went with the chicken option, so they had breast meat.  Peppercorn Steak - Grilled, tender AAA Striploin steak topped with peppercorn sauce wasn't the best and I would get a juicy stack some where else.  Spicy BBQ Pizza  - Grilled BBQ chicken, red pepper, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, onion and mozzarella cheese was quite surprising good and nicely done.  Meat Lovers - Grilled AAA Striploin steak, grilled chicken breast, jalapeno peppers and mozzarella cheese was my favourite one of them all and I really enjoyed it.  Meat Lasagne - Ground beef, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella cheese,served with Caesar salad was just average.   Chicken Dhaba Karahi - Succulent meat from the whole chicken cooked with onion, garlic, tomatoes, green chillies and dhaba spices, finished with fresh ginger and green coriander. Now this was awesomeness at its peak and we really enjoyed this dish. We ate this with naan, their naan were extremely good.  For dessert we when with Khoya Kheer and Malaee Kulfi both were average.  Over all foodwise it was a good experience but the service was extremely slow.  For my Muslim Bothers and Sisters - they serve halal meat at this location."}
{"text":"I used to really like going to Cara Mia / Desi Eh because their food was really nice. The last few times we have gone the food hasn't been good at all.  They need to clean their restaurant more often. The tables are all sticky, and the floor has obviously not been mopped in a very long time. If that's the state of the dinning area I don't even want to think what the kitchen would look like! I ordered the lasagna (which I have ordered many times before). It wasn't as flavourful as it used to be. There was zero salt or flavour in it at all. Also, I'm white and can't handle 'desi level' of spice so when I say there was no flavour there really truly were no spices used at all.  If you are considering eating in this area you are better off to check out one of the other amazing restaurants in the same plaza!"}
{"text":"The food was good taste wise ,very authentic. However worse service that's for sure. Also don't order the kheer. It was like rice pudding."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the chicken kharai was really good. I was not a fan of the mango lacci but other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Just came back from Desi Eh!, and were completely blown away by the authenticity of subcontinental cuisine served here (mainly Pakistani). Many may know this location as also the home of delicious halal Italian food, Kara Mia, but today we were introduced to another aspect of this gem of a place, completing the fine balance between Eastern and Western cuisine.   Lucky we got there just before dinner time as it got busy within 20 minutes after our arrival. The decor is simple but I smiled at how the mirrors on the roof were placed, allowing us to see the food on people's tables if we decided to look up. For appetizers we had a serving of Dahi Puri, a perfect mix of chickpeas, yogurt, tamarind, Potatoes and secret spices in a crispy hollow flour pocket (make sure you don't wait too long and put the whole piece in your mouth, to experience the flavours as they were meant to be tasted). It was a fitting appetizer, just enough to make sure we got a perfect start for a great meal, without making us feel it would interfere with the main course.   We ordered three types of chicken karahi, which can safely be classified as the specialty here.  Each of them was tasteful and yet different from each other. Chicken Hari Mirch (green chili chicken karahi) had a nice flavourful kick to it, and Chicken Dhaba Karahi had a spicier flavour found in more traditional restaurants in the subcontinent (Dhaba: A roadside small restaurant). Traditional Chicken Karahi will satisfy any cravings, for people seeking a little reminder of \"food back home\"; and hence is the main attraction. These are served in deep woks; and if you get a chance, I highly recommend saving a piece of your bread (be it a crispy roti, soft naan or a buttery paratha), to wipe off the rich gravy inside. That piece of bread was treated like a prized possession at our table.    Chicken-bin-tandoori (literal meaning being \"chicken, son of tandoor\") stayed true to its name and had spices that were just right (I initially required a little raita (yogurt with coriander) but got used to the sharp taste and started enjoying the spice (you may want more once finished). It was served sizzling in a griddle which was hot 20 minutes after it arrived our table too, with spiced meat easy to take off the bone.   Chicken seekh kabab (ground chicken with herbs and spices) was also good, soft to the touch and sumptuous, served sizzling in a hot griddle. They unfortunately ran out of Bihari Boti (perhaps really popular) but I didn't mind, I knew I would be coming back to try it out. A good side dish with kababs may be \"Lahori channae\" in case you are not interested in just meat as your main.   All said and done, the focus was on quality of food and not quantity, and was worth every penny. The menu offered more affordable options too (i.e. Platters which come with bread, rice, salad and famous Lahori channae (chickpea gravy); and option I may prefer if making a quick trip or in mood for simpler but still fulfilling tastes). Most impressive aspect was the excellent service provided. We asked where we needed more explanation and were recommended what would work best with us. Good part is that you will want to come back to try other dishes, and our first visit definitely heightened our faith in how good this new eatery is."}
