{"text":"Quick service ... Tasty flavourful food... the chicken kabob is great and tender, tandoori special gives you a nice mix and the beef kabob is also very flavourful and tasty. 

Salad could use a little extra something something but is fresh ingredients at least for now. 

Great place if you need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Tandoori Chicken kebab is so delicious! It is spicy but very tolerable. I have had it with rice and without rice, more than enough food to skip the rice though. The salad that it comes with is standard (cucumber, tomato, iceberg, dressing; coleslaw on the side). I ask for more coleslaw usually and they're happy to oblige.

The hot sauce they give you is unlike any I've had elsewhere, it is more of a salsa but don't let it fool you, it brings the heat! Ask for the white sauce as well (I think it's the salad dressing but I noticed a lot of regulars ask for a side of the white sauce), it helps cool down the spice. 

The Afghan naan is so delicious, I've gone in and had it as a snack before (only .99). Fairly pricey but knock the rice off the menu and my meal is under $10! Not bad.

As others have said, you will wait approx. 10min for your meal during weekday lunch hour."}
{"text":"Yummy food...and decent potion size for a v. decent price... I really like their salad as it felt extremely fresh.."}
{"text":"1st time in a Afghan restaurant and it was AWESOME!  
Good service, a lot of GREAT and SPICY food, an tasty bread.  
Price is OK.  If you don't want to eat much, just ask for your meal without rice... it'll save you some money.  It's a clean place and nice people.
If living or visiting Toronto, I will definitely go again.  
I really will visit Afghan restaurant from now on!"}
{"text":"I've gotten various meats (chicken and beef) prepared in different ways and I've loved every single option on the menu I've tried so far. I still skew towards the shamie dinner with rice though.

The meats are so flavourful and tasty. But let me tell you about the rice and naan. I never knew rice and naan, which are usually just secondary and never the main attraction, could be so good. The rice especially, always get the rice! You don't even need to mix in sauces or the meat like you do at other places that offer rice as a side because the rice has its own distinct flavour. I would pretty much go down there just to have the rice, to be honest. 

And even though I work midtown, I still make that trek over to Pamier Kabob for lunch. It is just that good."}
{"text":"Dined in at the 119 Spadina location on April 6th, 2015 and ordered two platters of the Tandoori Special with a Mango Lassi

1) Raw/Uncooked chicken was served and when notified to the staff about the chicken being undercooked, all I got was \"sorry\" with a smirk

2) Mango Lassi had rubber/chewy chunks and tasted sour. When I showed the staff the chunky material, they said \"YOGURT HASN'T GONE BAD! IT'S OKAY!\"

Another staff member then says we don't have a blender so the yogurt doesn't get blended finely which is why you're seeing chunks.

Clearly tasted sour so we ended up throwing it and serving raw/uncooked meat is absolutely inexcusable.

They have a long long way to go as far as service and attitude towards customers goes. They're lucky there isn't much competition downtown for this cuisine else with their garbage attitude and serving raw food, they'd be out of business really quick.

If the owner wants to reach out to me with any questions, I'm happy to talk but I wouldn't recommend this place unless you want to be subjected to crappy customer service and served raw food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food!  The staff are also courteous and eager to please.  In such a short period of time, Pamier has become a local favourite.  For an authentic Afghani experience, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Clean, good food. If you think the portions are inadequate, you may be fat. I had beef chunks with naan. They forgot the rice but I didn't need it. Too many huge tables. It seems the smallest table is for 4 people. A little weird is all."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is open with the restaurant oriented around families (as apparent from the long tables). I ordered the Chapli Kabab platter (be warned it has two red chilli pepper symbols next to it on the menu). The patties were flavourful and soft, with the rice having a nice texture. Sure, the salad was decent, but let's be honest, who is going to a kabab place for salad!! Only warning, the kabab may be too spicy if you're not used to it. I ordered a buttermilk along with the meal so that helped as well.

My review is biased because I was offput by the hotness of the meal, but I mean there was fair warning on the menu. This is an afghani restaurant and I think Chapli Kabab is one of the most authentic afghani foods there is, so do try it for yourself.

Also, if you hail from a foreign country, you can bring money bills from other countries to have them display it besides the cash."}
{"text":"I for one love afghan food and I'm always looking for afghan restaurants when I'm in town. This place had amazing food and was definitely afghan."}
{"text":"My work place is right next door to this place. I would strongly recommend that you try to skip breakfast and come here straight for lunch as the portions size is Huge! I would recommend the wazir dinner with rice and the hot naan with the red hot sauce. 

Price was average $12 not bad for big portions food!"}
{"text":"Great food, I always try and make it here when I'm working in the area. The Lamb Tikka was awesome!"}
{"text":"Another local place for dinner when we don't want to cook.  Usually we gravitate to the salmon kabob plates -- tender, fresh fish that is pleasantly spicy -- and Qabilee rice -- which is just heavenly. 

Occasionally we eat there -- if we're meeting up after work and are starving. It is often very quiet in the evenings, especially near closing time. Since we don't go there for lunch, we were amazed to learn from the staff how much business they do at lunch since we see a mostly empty restaurant.

The staff is very friendly and treat us well as regulars. So excellent service, pleasant experience, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Middle eastern food doesn't get enough loving! Delicious food at a good price, I'm shocked its not busier for dinner. That is why i'm giving it a pity five - really this place is a 4 - more people need try the deliciousness! 

We had the chaplee and karahi kebabs. Both were full of flavour and spice, but we preferred the karahi for its fresh herb flavours. 

While the food is great... the service is pretty terrible. Service and cheerfulness is clearly not this man's strong, but all is forgiven, he makes a mean kebab."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the place has decent ambience. I like the fact the place is open near till midnight some days because having a healthy grilled option at that time is a nice choice to have next to McDonalds. The food was mediocre really liked the chicken kebab but the Shamie kebab did not do much for me. I also did not like the fact there was no dressing on the salad. The pita was half cooked on one side and did not taste great. Good quantity of rice."}
{"text":"This is a great place for an eat-in dinner. It's slightly on the more expensive side than fast food but cheaper than restaurants. The quality of the food is phenomenal and is more delicious than most restaurants. The Chicken Kabob platter is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food. Decent Environment. Stressed Out Staff (Not Rude but Not Happy For Sure)"}
{"text":"We went in on a Sunday night. The place was not busy there was one other table waiting for a take out. We go in wait by the til to place an order and don't get any acknowledgement. After 5 minutes of waiting the staff behind the counter asks if we were there to place an order? I say yes. She goes ahead and takes our order. Takes about 15 minutes for the meal to pop up which is a decent time. We go up pick up our order from the counter. The food was very bland and lacked favor. The naan was over cooked to the point that it was crispy instead of soft. This was our first experience of Pamier Kabob."}
{"text":"The owners are liars.  They are advertising their meat being HMA and I work for HMA at no point has ever certified any of their locations.  Big time liars.  Check their website, I don't quite understand why they would put false information and trick the muslim community."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekday lunch.  Ordered the Beef tika kabob with rice and it was delicious!  Salad, rice and naan were pretty standard but the beef was really.  Juicy tasty tender beef chunks!  Worth the $10.72 after tax.

There was a steady trickle of people coming in around 2pm, but plenty of seating as the place is pretty big.  

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is over credited with other good reviews. I got a lamb shish kabob with chaplee. the meat was very dry inside and burned outside and the side salad was not fresh, dull without any type of dressing. Naan was not baked well enough, the bottom was white. The atmosphere of the restaurant has nothing special and turned down my appetide even more. Khairi kabob was too oily."}
{"text":"Stay way unless your white. Where to begin I will start with the good. There is an older gypsy looking woman that tried to listen and offer to resolve a mistake with our order. The bad, both my friend and I stopped in for some take out. We paid an extra $4 for rice and when we got back to work surprise surprise they omitted our rice. We went back and they gave us 2 big tubs of rice and we started to enjoy our meal. Just as we started my friend found a staple in the chicken and we went back to the counter to ask what happened. We were greated by an man that said it is company policy no refunds and what do you want me to do about it. At this time there was a line up of white people and the owner came out and said they aren't offering a refund. My friend took 2 bites and wasn't trying to get free food. Since we weren't backing down and there was a line up they offered to refund 1 of the 2 meals. That is when I said that isn't good enough I ain't eating my meal either. They then tried to offer a reduced discount and after I demanded a full refund or else no one from my work will ever go there they offered a full refund. This place is a joke they have no quality control and are rude. The cashier is dumb and was over charging other people while we were waiting as an attempt to make up the money they lost on our food. There are other middle eastern places within a 5 minutes walk and I felt in addition to their ignorance they also treated us bad because we aren't white. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"So i have been a customer since this place opened to the day I moved out of the country a few months ago. As a Pakistani, I miss the barbecue and proper kababs and proper naan bread, this stuff is amazing and authentic. The naan is fresh, the rice is flavorful and man the chapli kabab is almost as good as I remember from home and authentic! I am a super fan of all their red meat kababs, lovely food and the portions are generous. Another favorite of mine is the potato bolani. I just wish they start selling mantu soon too."}
{"text":"We discovered this place while driving by and decided to give it a try since Afghan cuisine is one of our favorites. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. There was sufficient seating but i think they were understaffed because many of the tables were dirty with rice strewn about. When we got the food it was a little above average, nothing to write home about. There are definitely better options around town if your in the mood for Afghani food."}
{"text":"Really good food!! Quantity and quality way better then Bamiyan!! Been a regular since 2009"}
{"text":"If you're able to look past the kitchen's disorganization and sit down to try their food, Pamier Kebob is definitely a hit!

To begin, I'm going to compare this to Watan Kebob, which I tend to frequent a bit more (only because it's closer by). 

I ordered via phone a Tikka Chaplee Kebob with rice as my post-cardio meal. I figured the protein and carb content should be plenty to keep me full for a while. When I got to the counter, they punched in my order wrong. I think this has more to do with how unprofessional my conversation on the phone with them was (not expecting much given a take-out order, but at least an ETA and a price would be nice; maybe take my callback number). I ended up getting a Tikka Kebob instead. 

It came with a decent amount of rice, some cuts of lettuce/cucumber/tomatoes with some dressing... not really colourful or appetizing all things considered, but no big deal. The bread it came with is about the same size as Watan's. 

There were 7 pieces of meat on top of the rice. I tried both the rice and the bread, and it's nothing special to be honest, standard afghani fare. 

The meat however - holy hell the way they cooked this brought this review up to a 5-star review! It was lightly seasoned but perfectly cooked. Watan tends to overlook their meat for whatever reason but the way it was cooked at Pamier was spot-on!! I genuinely love the taste (not of the spice but of the fresh-cooked meat); the taste of veal itself is so delicate and I was so happy it was preserved while still having it light crusted with spices!

I won't be coming back to Pamier for its service or it's excuse-for-a-salad, but the Tikka meat... that, I will come back for. 

This is a 5-star review for the food, but service brought it down by 1 star. The cashier at least had the decency to apologize about the mixup. That's a lot, given this is in Brampton. 

Quantity-wise, not as much as Watan but I was still satisfied after my meal."}
{"text":"This business most likely survives by word of mouth, because it is tucked away in the corner of a small neighbourhood plaza.  Inside is spacious and  very clean.  There is a fast-food vibe but the food is much better than fast-food quality!  We had the grilled fish with salad only, and barg kabob with salad and rice.  As  true authentic Afghan rice, it was very buttery and rich.  The two orders also came with a basket of two naan, perfectly baked onsite with seeds added to the centre for flourish.   

One thing we noticed was that we were the only ones who stayed to eat!  Lol, all other orders that night were take out (telephone orders or walk-ins).  Just gave 4 stars because the cashier was kind of neutral/ borderline unfriendly.  Oh well, maybe she had a long day.  Won't deter us from coming back!  :)"}
{"text":"I just had my first meal here.  I ordered the Lamb Tikka to go.  The meat was delicious and tender cooked to perfection.  I enjoyed the style of flat bread and the salad that went with the meat.  It was so good I just ordered another by phone to pick up for my husband.  It is a lovely new addition to our neighbourhood.  Thank you"}
{"text":"The food is okay but the customer service is utter trash. Bought around $70 of food and asked for more sauce (as anyone typically would)-- the food is pretty dry on its own. The lady there gave an attitude and denied. Don't compromise your standards and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Everything you've read is true. For \"fast food\" (if you can call it that), this place is spectacular. The meat is expertly spiced, perfectly cooked, and just plain delicious. The standard combo comes with salad (meh) and Afghan bread (like naan). The bread is fluffy and warm - a perfect combo with the meat. You can also add rice to the combo, but that would be too much food for me at lunch (since I get a 2-meat combo)

I've been twice. First time I got fish and chaplee, second time I got fish and shamie. Everything was delicious.

Mmmmmmmmmmm

One thing I have to point out - the kitchen is absurdly clean. It's as if it's a front and there is a greasy kitchen somewhere in another room. I don't know how they could possibly keep it so clean."}
{"text":"Good food. Good staff. I liked the chaplee kabobs and chicken ..... The only thing i would like to see is better interior design which was missing. Yet the food is no doubt good to eat n in huge quantity!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing which I normally order the chicken chaplee or the tandoori chicken.   This place really needs to have two people working at the cash.  I always call in my order to be picked up since it can be a long wait."}
{"text":"SO SO many options here! Its Kabob heaven - literally!

I had the chicken breast kebobs - the meat was SO SO tender, flavourful and melted right in your mouth and thats a great thing! 

The potato bread (starts with a b) was good - kinda like a flavourful potato quesadilla. I prefer Bamiyan Kebob house' potato bread however.

The Afghani naans were so fresh - made right there. I'd go back just for that.

Priced slightly higher than most other similar places but makes up for that in flavour, venue and location! Fantastic location right in the middle of all the action and the place is a good size, good seating and clean.

a MUST try! 

ps: Its Halal!"}
{"text":"I did delivery take out for this restaurant since i saw so many good reviews on this but i was very disappointed. I ordered a chicken and mixed meat combo. The delivery took a while , at least 30 min to get to my place which is in Toronto. When we got our order, it was missing items! They totally forgot to put rice in my mixed meat combo so i only had just a salad, naan and meat. The meat was slightly burnt.  I ordered two cans of ginger ale but they gave me two cokes instead and one of the cokes were defected (mangled). I don't think i'll want to order from them again."}
{"text":"I've been several times and the food is always excellent.
I've only had afghan food in Europe and this is on par,"}
{"text":"Hours on yelp are outdated and inaccurate. Update for a better review. Drove from far, not impressed."}
{"text":"I've never had Afghani food before so I have no idea if this place is considered good compared to others in the same category.  What I do know is that we ate delicious takeout from there and we would go back again in the near future.  

We ordered a dinner for 2 special set meal and it was enough for 3-4 people.  The girl helping us was very helpful telling me that the dinner for 2 was enough for 2 large eaters and 2 smaller ones.  She also recommended extra  naan and she proved right for our family of four.  

It did take a bit of time waiting for my takeout meal...about 15 minutes so maybe call ahead to order if you're in a hurry.  Also we were there on a weeknight at around 530 pm.  After I ordered there was a lineup behind me of about 6 people deep."}
{"text":"Poor service coupled with decent food. I usually do take out from here.

I love the keema kabob combo, good value for the dollar. Sultani Kabab is great as well.

Decor is out of place but practical.

Overall, good fresh food coupled with minimum wage service. What else can you expect? Owner is probably not close to the day to day operations."}
{"text":"Service is good.  Quick to get the orders ready.  Clean place.  Best of all food is excellent chicken is perfectly cooked and very tender.  I will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Urf, gotta update this one.

From my very popular and wildly successful previous review, you'll know that one of the biggest draws to this place was the price.

Well, they raised the price. By $2. That's a 33% increase. Dal Sabzi w rice is now gonna be over $10. I don't know, the food's pretty good, but in the (deliciousness * amount of food) / cost equation, it's just not looking as hot anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and lamb kabobs and naan. Rice has an interesting flavour - very yummy!"}
{"text":"Naan bread was hard and the portions were smaller than Bamiyan's. Overall, the food was average at best, but the staff could be a little friendlier."}
{"text":"Not that great.  Service was slow and the food was blah.  Cheap cuts of meat used and nothing really stood out in terms of taste or quality.  We paid a lot and the value just wasn't there.  We won't be going back.  Time to find another Afghani place to try!"}
{"text":"Kabobs! Salad! Afghans! This Kabob joint is very good, although it looks like a fast food place from the mid 90's on the inside. I bet it's very popular for lunch on the weekdays. I tried some Tandoori chicken and rice. Enough for two people. Probably the best cooked chicken kabobs I've tried."}
{"text":"For a quick meal this place is a hidden gem. Great Afghan food. Perfectly marinated and grilled meet and the naan is freshly baked and delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. I saw a guy who was handling other stuff at a point handling my bread with his hands, so I merely suggested to the waiter who bought my order that he should wear gloves. I was then accused of lying and wasting their time, and was told to take the order if I want or leave it, and that nobody cares. I then asked for a refund because I didn't like how they were behaving with me, and he said I can't give you a refund, don't waste my time. Will not be coming back because I have no wish for being insulted for stating the truth and expecting basic decency."}
{"text":"Pretty big portions. Ordered the beef for 10.99. Came with bread, sauces, salad, rice, and coleslaw. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Normally I really like the food here but after today Im done eating it for good. The asian lady that is in charge of serving the dishes is a wreck and not only took about 15 minutes to prepare my to go, but also didn't even check to make sure it was accurate resulting in me getting back to my desk only to realize I had no rice. 

at $13 a pop, the least you can do is make sure that 1. when someone orders a chicken kabob you actually put one on the grill (yes, I saw you do this AFTER you checked my ticket as you noticed I had been waiting a while) 2. If someone spent the extra, near $4 for rice, make sure its in the container. 3. when someone asks if both sauces are in the bag, don't lie and say they are only for me to point out they aren't.

I'm sure my business wont be missed as this place is always busy but make sure to check your orders."}
{"text":"Worst service of all time, prices on menu are lower then the actual prices and the cashier was arguing about a ride home for 3-5 mins with another employee in front of line making us all wait and watch. Clearly they have no clue about good customer service BUT...the food is real good nonetheless"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place just when they opened up for dine-in and take-out but over time food quality went way down. On several occasions, I got served with half cooked food. Their Chapli kabobs are the worst, you can taste the raw beef taste. After about 2 years of avoiding this place, I went their again 2 weeks ago and noticed some improvement with quality of food. I only order chicken breast kabobs because of my past experience and it was actually ok. Today I made the mistake to go there with family for lunch. What a horrible experience that turned out to be. I order Shahi Kabob which comes with Chicken breast kabob and Chapli kabob. Chicken breast kabob wasn't cooked properly and was barely eatable but Chapli kabob was worst than ever. I took it back and they told me that they will replace Chapli kabob only from the plate. After about 15 minutes they either warmed up the same Chapli kabob or gave me new one with simile uncooked beef taste. I threw it in the garbage and will never be going to this place again. What a waist of time and money.

Final verdict, one might get away with ordering chicken only dishes but stay away from any beef dishes unless you want to get sick."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2.5 stars on an overall bases as everything except the food was not at par.

First impression when getting in... Tables dirty, service station was very messy and unclean. Walking in, we found a table and had to clean it ourself and then I went to use the washroom which was not the best of conditions. 

I think the staff could not handle the crowd coming in as one person was talking orders on the phone, in person and also serving the food. Whereas, 2 other people were cooking the food. 

The service was was quite poor as I came to order and instead of taking my order the staff member started taking the take out orders on the phone which rang after I was talking to her. I had to stop her from taking an other call so my order can go in as I was waiting for 10 mins to just place the order at the till. 

After a long long wait the food can one after another. The menu is similar to other Afgan place but its more spicier then others. Our order included bunch of various chicken kabaab dishes, one lamb kabab dish, Qabilee Rice and lot of naans. The food was hot, rice was cooked nice and meat was well seasoned, juicy, tender and spicy. We had to do our own work as get all the stuff and had to ask for the white sauce. The food was good!

Over all the service was poor, restaurant was not clean but the food was quite good.

P.S. For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat and state it on their site as well."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. Both times I left quite impressed. The portion was generous to say the least and the food itself was delicious. Well-spiced, fresh and presented very nicely alongside a gigantic piece of fresh Afghani Naan. With the overwhelming amount of cheap Falafal joints in the area, it's nice to have a Middle Eastern option that's a bit of a step up. Sure, it's not necessarily a cheap lunch, but for what you get, you certainly won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"For those looking for something a little more Afghan for lunch options, Pamier Kabob manages to give you a dose of authenticity right in downtown Toronto.

The large slab of Afghan flatbread that they give you is moist and tender, and is perfect for going with their kabobs, or in my case, the spicy chicken qorma.  The bread is easily better than the one at Bamiyan, and the portions are generous.  The chicken qorma was spicy, with the spice coming from what looks like green chilis, which makes it spicy without going crazy.  My meal also came with a side salad, which was on the spot as well.

This place definitely makes my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Bad service
Messed up my order 
Arrogant owner and management 
Forks were dirty and had black stuff all over it.  When I said he forks were dirty they just said oh it's smoke from the grill don't worry.  
Got a take out order and double checked with them before I left.  I get home and low and behold the order is wrong.  I called them and they didn't even care they were so arrogant.  Will boycott this place for sure"}
{"text":"We've also tried the shamie kabob and beef qorma. Both were nicely spiced. They come with naan and salad at a reasonable price. The mango smoothie has a nice texture and tastes great. The seating is not so busy, but lots of people visit for take-out."}
{"text":"I decided to order take-out from Pamier Kabob one rainy day after reading the various positive reviews on Yelp. Unlike most Middle Eastern places I've gone to, this place looked new and clean. There was only one other couple in the restaurant ordering ahead of me. I ordered the Lamb Tikka with rice and the total came out to a bit over $13. I whipped out my Mastercard to pay when the clerk, to my dismay said he would have to charge a $2 surcharge! His reasoning was because the credit card fees are high. He also went on to say that if I ordered $20 or more, he would waive the charge but $2 is outrageous! Step aside Asian restaurants with a $0.25 charge for totals under $10, hello Pamier Kabob! I could also see the look on the guy in front of me's face when the same guy gave him $10 in loonies because they had no bills. Pitiful.

After about a 10 minute wait, I finally got my food (a bit long for takeout considering it was just myself and the couple). The food was a bit pricey but plentiful. The Lamb Tikka was actually quite delicious although there was much more rice than lamb. The flat bread that it came with was quite good.

All in all I'd say it's an OK place if you're in the area but I've had better Afghan food for the price. I was also extremely appalled by their $2 surcharge and will refuse to do business with them in the future."}
{"text":"I don't normally write Yelp reviews. In fact, I had to download the app just to post this one. However, I must say, upon entering this place, I was stunned with the decor and cleanliness. For a takeout place, it's extremely well put together. 
They have plenty of vegetarian options, and the portions are very generous. 
Most importantly, the food is absolutely delicious. I've never tried Afghani food before, but this place definitely turned me in to a fan. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I kept passing this place at lunchtime wanting to try, the Afghanis  definitely know how to do kebabs/grilled meats.  It's squeaky clean and looked promising. The smell that came from the kitchen also had a distinct 'come hither' quality. I was struck by a bit of sticker shock so I got a wrap for around $6. I got the hot/spicy variation on my wrap but I think the hot sauce they apply is a little too on the vinegary side which overpowers the taste of the otherwise gloriously tender meat. Also I would like them to state that the tikka wrap is infact beef.  The word 'tikka' refers simply to a style of cooking  and doesn't say much else. People who aren't familiar with Afghani cuisine might find the menu a bit  of an enigma. 
I would go back ( maybe on a pay day) but I would get something else and avoid the hot sauce. They do have a good selection of meats and combos. I also like the carb free option. I just wish the signage gave you a bit more info and I wish it was lighter on my wallet."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff and fast service. Salad in the shawarma is never fresh but the meat is tasty. Opt for salad-free shawarmas and you're good"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but they close the store down whenever they feel like it. I have come by many times at 12pm-1pm on a Saturday to see the store closed with someone in the kitchen. So you're better off calling ahead to see if they are free."}
{"text":"Worse service ever! Be careful! Worst location! The said sauce cost TOO MUCH and they don't care what there customers think. Very much deserve 1 star I wish there was something lower."}
{"text":"This is healthful middle eastern soul food at its finest! Mounds of crunchy fresh iceberg lettuce, slices of tomato and cucumber, tossed with just enough creamy white dressing the way salad should be eaten. The basmanti rice drenched in cumin is nice too as well as the naan which is more of a flatbread style rather than the fluffy white Indian naan. Then there are the kabobs, with many different styles that it will take a few visits to try them all unless you go with a large group (recommended!). They are charbroiled to perfection with the chicken spiced delicately and cooked so that it is still juicy and tender inside and dry on the outside. The most impressive thing was the sauce that came with the Beef Qorma, outrageously good! With a depth of flavour rivaling the best curries, yet spiced Afghan style, and different than any other sauce I've tried, it is something to behold. Their menu is extravagant with fish, potatoes, and tandoori, all looking incredibly attractive in the pictures and I'm so sure that they will delight you that five stars is the only choice. Add to the amazing cuisine, a dining area with an elaborate modern ceramic tiled wall and... space. There's tons of room between tables so you can swing your coat around without hitting anyone in the back of the head or get up and leave the table without everyone else having to shuffle their chairs back and forth. With space at a premium in restaurants, the layout is exemplary. There is no table service, so you have to go up and get your order served in plates on plastic trays. Proving that I would suck at serving, I slid a heaping plate of Afghan rice over the counter onto the bench in front of the counter guy. He gave me a blank stare and promised me a new plateful. Excellent service and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times on my own and have always liked the food, today I'm here with my wife and she agrees, this is the best place for a kabab"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible place. Placed an order over the website and waited for an hour and a half only to be told that they hadn't checked their website. Really rude and unapologetic. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Pamier is a great Afghani style restaurant. I used to drive far and wide to get to a Bamiyan Kebab for my Afghan fix and now I am glad I do not have to anymore. 

My favourite item is the Chaplee Kebab, it consists of two round patties of beef riddled with freshly grated spices. As you are eating it you can taste the excess of spices they put on it. Similar to Bamiyan, Pamier produces an extremely well seasoned and near perfectly cooked end product. With your order you can opt for naan and salad, or pay a couple more dollaz for long grain basmati rice. Future patrons need to realize Afghani style naan in the GTA is not Indian style naan which is large, oval in shape and cooked in a tandoor. Afghani style is smaller, harder and a different dough mix. 

The only drawbacks:

-The wait time can be up to 15 minutes at times, even when they do not appear to be that busy. 

-The price point is slightly higher then what I would like to pay, you are looking at $12-15 for a proper meal. 

Overall I am always impressed with Pamier and will continue to return in the future."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Lunch or dinner there, takeout or eat in.  They make all food to order, so it takes a few minutes, but since the seating is plentiful and clean its not an issue.  The lunch portions are easily enough for dinner too, unless of course you can't stop eating it because its so good (which may happen, be warned).

They do a brisk lunchtime business on Spadina, but dinner is only a little slower.  So get there a little before 12 or a little before 6 and you should not have a long wait.  They do know the \"regulars\" and when they see them coming often just start the order, which does help speed things up.  

If you are in the area, and are interested in trying something new, this is a good place to stop in."}
{"text":"When your regular Afghani take-out goes from $12 to $16 to $18 in less than a year, its time to find another take-out. This isn't fine dining, prices should reflect that. This place gets a lot of customers from the nearby offices and it looks like they got greedy. They've lost my business."}
{"text":"I ate dinner there last night, and it was really good!!

We tried their lamb tikka dinner with rice, beef kabob, and tandoori chicken kabob. All of the meat was very flavorful, the rice had some flavor, the salad not so much (although maybe we didn't notice it because the meat was so tasty), and their naan tasted like something in between pita bread and Indian naan. 

Their portion sizes are pretty big, and meaty, and everything comes with salad and naan. So we should have just ordered two things, with no rice, and gotten drinks. We were pretty thirsty by the time we finished, because of the spices from all the meat, and using the chilli sauce as a dip for their naan."}
{"text":"This review applies on to the takeout meal. I will update when I have had a chance to dine in. I had passed by this place numerous times but thought that it was just another run of a mill spot then the decent reviews started to rake up so had to bookmark it for a visit. 
On a cold evening after finishing up at the movie theater nearby we decided to hit this spot for a quick take out. 
The menu is too the point and is separated by the kind of meat you want grilled. We ordered the mixed chicken combo but since they were out of certain parts of that mix we ended up substituting and I also got to try the chapli kebab (flat kebab which is fried) as that region is known for it. So with in 10-15 min out food was ready to go.
Upon arriving home once we open the container we found out that there was enough food to easily fill up two people. The salad was forgettable. The rice (generous portion) was decent. The main attraction of meat was seasoned well though over cooked IMO. 
Again to be fair a better was to judge the grilled items is when they are hot of the grill. Still its a decent version of this cuisine. I will be back to try it again.
3 Stars."}
{"text":"Best Afghani in town! 
Succulent pieces of meat always. Hard to resist fresh naan always! It's pretty busy during lunch so either come early or use Ritual to order."}
{"text":"This place is always very quiet in the evenings.  Every single time I've walked by, there are very few (if any) people inside.

We decided to go by the Yelp reviews and take a chance.  We ordered the mixed kebab dinner for two.  It was really good!

There was a whole container of rice (tasty), one container of salad (iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, coleslaw, and dressing), and a third container of 4 types of kebabs.  All the meats were seasoned differently giving each a unique flavour.  They were also very tender and cooked to order.  The meal for two was very generous.  Three people could eat and be full.

I'm quite surprised this place isn't busier at night for dinner.  Given the quality, quantity, and taste of the food, it's a great place!  

BTW: Service was friendly and very informative."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great if you want a quick lunch. The food is great, filling and nutritious.

At this restaurant you order at the front, wait for your number to be called and then pick up your entree. If you work in the area I highly recommend it. The portions are also huge. You might have enough left over for dinner or the following days lunch. 

You should definitely check burnout if you are looking for a balanced and healthy meal."}
{"text":"I'm drooling just thinking about it... I can't get enough of this place. The meat is seasoned so deliciously, the naan/bread is the perfect compliment, and I honestly don't know how rice, yeah RICE, can be so tasty. I don't really know what I've ordered most the time but I know damn well it'll be great."}
{"text":"2.5

Points for the clean front of house. I was expecting it to be a little seedy, but the decor was bright and inviting. Now, to be fair, I've never had Afghani food before. So perhaps I'm not a fan of Afghani food in general-- but I was unimpressed.

The menu on the wall is a bit confusing and doesn't offer any description of what each dish is. Thankfully, they have a printed menu to help you out a bit.

My boyfriend ordered the Vaziri Lamb and really liked that lamb chop kebabs, and was less enchanted with the ground lamb. I ordered the Chaplee Kabob, because it was the spiciest thing on the menu and with two chili peppers beside it, I was in. 

But when our food was ready, all of it kind of looked like dog food. Honestly? Zero points for presentation. Every kebab that came out of the kitchen was brown. Brown, brown, brown. My Chaplee Kabob was two brown patties with a salad and rice. No sauces to accompany the meats, except for the watery, bruschetta like red sauce that they told me was 'hot sauce' when I asked for some. The white sauce tasted like bottled ranch dressing. I think the dressing on the salad was the same thing. So definite loss of points for not making their own sauces, or if those sauces were homemade-- points off for tasting like bottled sauces and/or just bland.

I should say that while the Afghani Naan was hot-- it was quite delicious, but it quickly cooled into a miniature surfboard with sesame seeds.

The spices in the meat were nice, but nothing spectacular--definitely tasted better than dog food, but not especially tender of mouthwatering. I just wasn't too impressed with this lunch--especially with the great reviews it receives from Yelpers whom I know and trust.

Like I said-- maybe it's just not my thing. I normally love new types of food because there are so few that I haven't tried. But I have to say that I was very let down by this experience. Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"The food has always been amazing! My favorite dish is chicken Tikka.   The staff has always been pleasant and the food proportions have always been more than adequate."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. You're treated, and spoken to in such a disrespectful fashion. I ordered over the phone for pick up, and thought maybe the person on the end didn't have great phone etiquette and proceeded to pick up my order. Upon arrival, she said I called to order but didn't say for what day. Of course, that's absurd. I ordered again. Upon trying the food, it was not even what I ordered. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I love their kabobs and rice. I have been to Pamier many times; alone, with friends, and even with family. It's a three minute drive from my home. I wish it wasn't tucked away in the corner of a plaza otherwise people would know about it more. The service is not waiter style rather order at the counter than sit down, so I can understand that. I find them to be quite attentive because they have never messed up on my orders and even have substitute things for us if its a reasonable request and when needed. 

I personally find their naans and pitaa much much better than Bahmyan Kabob in the North Mississuaga/ Brampton area. Even their meat I find is a better quality.  They also have some sauce dishes rather than just dry dishes with meat cutlets. You can tell them how hot you want the food.

Overall,  the food is hearty, fills a good craving, and I think is my home away from home. I actually like this Afghani food a little better than some of the Mediterranean food I have had- and that's my favorite cuisine, so it's saying a lot. I'm not over-rating this place, it's just my personal take on this place from being here many many times and feeling extremely fulfilled afterwards. 

You can't make a judgement after going once. A lot of their dishes are different, and I think a fair assessment can be made if you have been there at least twice. 

They now have a American/ Italian cuisine sister restaurant next door, but since I can get that cuisine in a lot of places, I stick to the Afghani yummy-ness offered at Pamier Kabob."}
{"text":"I came in here with my boyfriend on a Saturday evening around 5pm. My overall first impression was good. Nice decor, clean and most importantly, friendly staff. We ordered the chicken quorma, kabuli rice and barg kabob. The food is some of the best afghan I've had in a long time. Well definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is a generous 3 stars as the wait time for my food was eternal. I've been to their location in Brampton and they pretty much put of the food identically here - notably well-seasoned, high quality meats freshly cooked over a flame.

I could see the place was busy, and I should've known it was going to take too long, but I still didn't plan for 30 minutes plus to receive two take out wraps. Shortly after I ordered, one person asked for a refund since she wasn't told how long the wait was and couldn't stay any longer. The explanation was that \"it's prepared fresh\", that's true enough, but having gone to the other location at a quieter time, I know it shouldn't take this long. I think there were literally 3 people working, and we're talking about lunchtime with orders being placed constantly, with a mostly full seating area of at least 20. There's just no excuse for that, and they really should be bringing in more help. They've also been open for several months, so they shouldn't be surprised.

Still, I can't deny that it's very tasty, good quality food for right around $10. I'd just say to avoid lunchtime from my experience, unless you don't have to be back at work in a timely way."}
{"text":"I love this place. The kebabs rolls and plates are average price, but it's yummy. The food is pretty quick, and the environment is fine - I mean, it's not beautiful or anything, but it's fine. It's a good lunch with colleagues kind of spot more than a date spot - if you get what I mean. Expect to pay about $12-15 per person for a very filling meal (or even 2 small meals!). 
Solid option for people who aren't able to make it to the suburbs for better Afghan cuisine."}
{"text":"Poor service, mediocre food
Have been here twice, and its clearly below average. The meat is not great, not that flavourful, a bit overcooked. Salad's are one of the only decent parts of the package. The naan bread is the biggest disappointment, yet included with every meal. The food made one person in our party sick for a day.

Service was disappointing too, as a party of six we were hounded to leave, 45 minutes before closing time. Really gave the impression they did not want us back. 

Would not recommend, would not return"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place, and even arrived at a niche hour of theirs - 11:30pm on Saturday.

My wife and I split one dinner (the mild beef skewers) which comes with seasoned rice, salad, and warm naan, and  i ordered another a separate tandoori chicken skewer. 

The meat is cooked to order over a flame grill (so don't complain about the wait time). The beef was nice and seasoned. I'd prefer something spicier, but that's not my wife's thing - still tasty however. The tandoori was flavourful, and actually a bit spicy which was nice, and a nice char on it. The sides were all good - albeit a bit unspectacular. They provide a pretty good hot sauce, though I feel there could be something else for the naan.

The price-range is listed here in the $11-20 range, but it's on the much lower range of that scale for a platter, and they do have wraps for around $7. Beyond that, (and here's the cheap side of me coming out) is that since you order at the front, you can dine-in without having to tip. So that makes your meal about 15% cheaper than if it were regular dine-in.

As others said, the decor is very average. There was a lot of unfinished dry walling - so hopefully that's a sign of renos...but it was hard to tell.

Overall: the meat is the star here, pretty good value and open late when you need it."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were correct, this is one of the greatest places in Brampton. Plenty of seating and the prices were reasonable for such huge portions. Tandoori special is a must order along with sharing the Quilabi rice over the straight basmati. The raisins, carrots and nuts really add to the flavour. The tandoori chicken was white meat with lots of flavour, the beef (shamie) kebab was also very good. I wasn't a fan of the flat beef patties (chaplee) made on the grill because it contained more fat. Going with the skewer meats is a healthier and less greasy option. Will have to return in the future."}
{"text":"Wonderful flavours with all the kabobs. Lamb is also very delicious. The salad that is served with the meal is great but I didn't care much for the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends tonight for a casual dinner based on a recommendation. 

The restaurant was extremely clean and well kept, which is a plus for any restaurant. One thing I did not like was the fact that they did not have any pictures associated with any of their menu items on the wall. Especially for a non-frequent afgan/kabob foodie like myself, I wasn't able to easily decide on what I wanted.

I ended having the tikka chaplee (sp?) kabob with rice. The portion was huge and was worth the 13$. Although the meat was a little dry, the meal itself was decent."}
{"text":"I tried 2 Afghan Kabob places in Sauga and think both are better than Pamier. But I'd have to settle for Pamier when I'm in Toronto because there aren't many Afghan places here.

I had the Shahi Chicken which is chicken breast kabob + a beef patty (shami), with rice and salad. It's a decent amount of food for $12.99. I live near many Iranian eateries so I find this price on point in comparison. Taste wise, it's good. The chicken was very tender and flavorful. The beef patty was also flavorful. 

There are a few minor strikes against, but none of these would rule the place out for me. In combination it's only minus 1 star. I would have given this place 4 stars otherwise. a) The rice I found a bit oily. I came late so maybe I got the rice at the bottom of the pot with a higher concentration of oil than expected. b) Secondly, I thought the chicken pieces were a bit small. Naan & Kabob in Sauga as i remember has massive pieces of chicken breast. c) The last little thing that erked me was that the bread didn't feel fresh, which I suspect again is because I came very late. 

I had take out so I can't commend on the service. Restaurant looks fine. I don't think of middle eastern restaurants as service restaurants. As long as I get my delicious food, I'm happy. I was happy last night. I would consider coming again."}
{"text":"Not good at all. I wonder why I revisited this place, I won't in the future.

First of all, they are very slow, I waited more than 15 mins for my tikka kabob.

Secondly, they forgot to put SAUCE in my meal. My tikka kabob cost 13.5 dollar,  which is not cheap at all,  and they forgot my fxxking SAUCE! 

Last but not least, their spoons and forks are quite dirty and disgusting."}
{"text":"I love Afghan food and Pamier does it really well! I had the Shahi lamb and beef with rice and bread. So authentic I thought I was in the Shahikot Valley or the Hindu Kush! Fresh and tasty. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Pamier Kabob.  The Brampton location is SOOO good!  So when I found out there was one in Mississauga, I was psyched.    So I came here a few months ago and got the Shahi combo (I think that's what it was called) without salad. The meat was cooked perfectly and quite tasty.  

So why the 3 stars vs. 5 stars for the one in Brampton?

A) The naan bread wasn't as crispy or as hot as the one in Brampton.

B) I wasn't given any salsa or tahini (I think that's what the white stuff is called).  

I know docking 2 stars for those two little things seem extreme, but it's what makes the meal perfect for me.

Verdict: I will give them another shot, but I find the Brampton location to be much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely blessed food. Terrible service. Need to fix their attitude. But food is great. I am a regular from utm, I wish they'd hire new service staff."}
{"text":"So i wanted to give this place another try and here is what i experienced couple weeks back.

Extremely rude staff.  

The food tasted very bad. Their chaplee kabab dinner was a disaster and they did not have the waziri dinner available as they ran out of mince. I asked if they can substitute it with something else and they gave me an attitude.

Place is filthy dirty.
the girls at the counter do not bother cleaning out the garbage once people leave the restaurant. 
So all the customers had to leave the garbage/leftovers on the bin which was piling up more and more (i should have taken a picture and posted here)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience the staff is very friendly and the place is kept very clean. They offer exact same menu as Bamyan on Dixie Eglinton and I find the taste more authentic than Bamyan.  The place is not busy at all and you get your food fairly quickly with a good quantity same as Bamyan. 

They accept the credit card and offer lots of free parking in the plaza which is a good plus. There are tons of shops around the area this is the best for halal eaters.

I would ditch Bamyan over this if they keep the quality of their food same."}
{"text":"Pamier Kabob is a restaurant chain that serves Afghani food much like it's more famous competitor Bamiyan Kabob. I have a love for Afghani food because it's healthy, hearty and it's reasonably priced for the food you're receiving. I was in the downtown core and i wanted to see if Pamier Kabob was as good as Bamiyan Kabob or Naan and Kabob.

I ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob with rice ($10.75 plus tax). The meal consisted of  one grilled skewer of marinated boneless pieces of chicken breast with basmati rice, tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, coleslaw and a naan bread.

The dish was really good, the salad was crisp and fresh, the basmati rice was perfectly cooked, moist but not too moist and lightly seasoned. The chicken breast kabob was perfect, juicy, flavourful, perfectly seasoned and tender. The naan bread was fresh, lightly toasted and soft. The only thing I don't care much for was the coleslaw which was essentially just shredded cabbage without any dressing.

If you like Afghani food and you're in the downtown core, I definitely recommend Pamier Kabob, the food is healthy, delicious, reasonably priced in comparison to it's competitors. The place also has ample seating and is very clean."}
{"text":"Great food, you must try the lime juice.  The customer service is pretty good.  Tandoori and Chapli kabob are really good."}
{"text":"We ordered food from them our Chapli kabob was burnt. When we called them to tell them they did nothing to help. They basically said we cant do anything \"it happens sometimes\". After requesting that they should replace our order they said they don't remember the order sorry???? Poor service! Poor food quality. The owner is rude and arrogant! Don't waste your money here for to bamiyon or watan kabob where they care about customers and service!"}
{"text":"I have limited experience with Afghan food and my last experience was not good at all.  About 3-4 years, we walked into a restaurant in Scarborough at around 12:15 pm or so for lunch and the guy starts looking at us like \"what are you doing here?\" And I say, \"uhh...are you open?\"  He goes we only serve breakfast now and we close at 1 pm. Weird.  So that scared me away for a few years. Working downtown though, a lot of the food is semi North American-ized, so I figure if I want authentic food, Mississauga and Brampton are the places to go for Indian and Middle Eastern food.  

And so I decide the venture straight north (no seriously, I just straight on Hurontario, no turns whatsoever lol) and once I enter Brampton, I'm like \"I better stop now and find food\".  

Anyways, I ordered the tandoori special w/rice, which comes with one skewer on tandoori chicken, one skewer of beef, salad, rice and naan.  Both skewers were absolutely delicious.  They were moist and juicy and I've had my share of problems with places grilling meat too dry.  The tandoori chicken wasn't too spicy, but it had a nice kick to it.  Really tasty, though a bit drier than the beef. The normal beef skewer was so juicy.  It was so soft and moist, I felt like I was in heaven.  

As for the sides, these were all good too.  Naan was fresh and hot with a bit of sweetness to it (Afghan naan which is more like a mix of Indian naan and a pita) and the salad had fresh ingredients.  

Excellent meal.  However, the price isn't cheap, but it's well worth the money. Excluding taxes, it is $11.49 even though it's not full service.  I still felt that I got my money's worth though.  

Service and atmosphere is also pretty good. Clean area.  There is a numbering system up on the wall (like a deli), so you know when your food is ready and you just go pick it up at the counter. Simple idea, wish my non full-service restaurants would do this.  Food is anywhere between 5-15 minute wait.  

Verdict: Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The food here was really flavorful especially the chaply kebab. The regular beef kafta kebab was really good minced meat beef kebab. 

 The portions were on the average side meaning to people could not share one entrée but the food was quite flavorful and we did finish our plates I would be back next time and I might order something else I got a combination plate with one chicken and one beef chapli, so I like the fact that I was able to do sort of a combo and tried both things. 

The atmosphere was decent and the tables and such were nice to but it definitely would not be considered fine dining by any means they also were not quite prompt about coming and cleaning your table which was a little bit of an annoyance but the food was good so it's OK"}
{"text":"The food here was really good and I'm actually pleasantly surprised how even though the location is not in the suburbs the downtown location was just as tasty if not more. I would definitely come back here next time I was in the city and will continue bringing friends here as we did this past time when we visited. The nice thing about the downtown location is that it's a nice size facility and it's not super tiny. The food was delicious and our friends had a great time. Thanks for having such a delicious place in the central location of the city."}
{"text":"I've never had Afghani food so can't say how authentic it is but it surely is delicious. Lots of rice if you order rice and it's tasty, all the meals come with salad and naan (it seems Afghani naan is somewhere between Indian naan and bread), and the chili sauce it's served with is absolutely delicious. It's almost like a home-made salsa. I didn't know such interesting food was in Brampton and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummmy! Delicious kabobs!!! One of my favs that I've eaten in the GTA! I love afghani food and this one is the best around! The Chapli Kababs are a big hit and the tandoori chicken boneless is amazing as well. They have combos so you get to try both things! Yummmy food, always busy location but will definitely be back again and again!!!! Their ground kababs are really flavorful as well! Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever received. Order $125 worth of food at 11:14am, when arrived at the location an hour later - the staff was CLUELESS. They were asking me what I ordered and started preparing my order then. I will never ever go to this restaurant or order from them. It's not always about making good food. Customer service is key!!"}
{"text":"This place needs more reviews and more customers!! :)
I've only been to this place twice and was recommended by YELP. Both times I've been there they are always quiet. While we were making the order/waiting for our food there were customers coming in for take outs. 

I do have to say the wait time for your food is quite long. But once you dig into your food, it will all be worth it!!!!!! I ordered their Karahi Kabob (beef) yesterday and it was perfect. The meat cubes were not too chewy or tender, it was just great. My friend ordered a chicken kebab and it was wonderfully made as well! Not dry at all!

And did anyone mention their NAAN???? HOLY SMOKES it's by far the best naan ever!! 

YUMMMMM! Definitely worth the try and money and wait."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of afghan food here, it's a little more on the pricey side compared to the others I've tried later but honestly the food was very good.   The dining room is very spacious too for large family gatherings."}
{"text":"Best kabobs I've had in my life.  Incredible spices, flavor and the meats are tender, succulent and charred perfectly.  This place is on a completely different level.  Get the tandoori special, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I ordered the tandoori meal with rice, salad and naan, through Ritual. First, there was no rice. Second, the salad was abysmal. It was soggy and warm and covered in a strange white sauce. Third, the chicken was awful. It was totally rubbery and chewy. I don't expect the world from a $12.99 meal, but come on. I had to throw the entire thing out."}
{"text":"Authentic Afghani food! 

My husband heard about this place from a missionary who formerly worked in Afghanistan. He was so excited to go that we took a 45 minute drive to Brampton just to try it and it surely did not disappoint!

We ordered a combination of chicken, lamb and beef kebobs served over rice and vegetables. We also ordered a delicious mango drink (mango lasi?). All the meat we had were wonderfully flavored with fresh spices that brought out the best in the meat.  The meat can be considered \"gamey\", i.e. without much fat, quite lean while retaining its juiciness.

Prices were not cheap (anywhere from $10 - $20 per plate) but well worth it.

The staff were courteous and is a place I would go again."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  The regular restaurant has no ambiance, but they do have a party room!  
Which can be decorated quite nicely
Booked a party in the party room, food was good and the staff most helpful. I was most pleased with the service.  Sad to hear they are closing down, hope they open another place with a party room in west mississauga or oakville. I would definitely recommend.
Washroom was very clean."}
{"text":"No impressed at all with the food taste, but it is not that bad. I had a take out of kabobs with salad and bread.
The bad rating is for the Huge Bug that was in my salad... and I mean huge!!!"}
{"text":"The veal chaplee dinner with salad and naan was delicious. It does take longer because everything was made fresh to order so don't expect fast food times. 

The server and cook behind the counter was friendly and patient with our order. 

The salad was basic with the white dressing drizzled on top, it wasn't over dressed which is great! They had an amazing coleslaw on top which was vinegary goodness. The bread was warm and fresh and the vinegar red dressing was refreshing. 

The veal chaplee was flavorful, lots of different spice profiles and 2 large patties came with the meal. The chicken tandoori was also really good but I definitely would go back just for the chaplee.

They also have daily specials :)"}
{"text":"I like their chicken kebab ask for kebuli rice its extra charge but worth it!! Last time  their AC wasnt working too good so i was being grilled too! 3 stars down cuz of customer service which they lack! The cook shud stop talking loud on her cell while there are customers sitting out! The other day she was arguing w a coworker and I could hear her even thou I don't understand afghani but I could say it was an argument!! This woman is ruining this business for sure! Like the food but 0 for service!"}
{"text":"Good value with decent serving size! Chicken Korma was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. My husband and I often crave Pamier. We usually get the tandoori special and the sultani kabob and mix and match. Generous portions, meats are always tender and the rice is delicious and long grain, their naan is also very good. 
We had unexpected company one evening and ordered the mixed kabob for 2 and it was perfect for the 4 of us. Everyone had ample to eat. 
Do try their chaplee kabobs, my personal favourite, tender and well spiced! If you like spice then get an extra container of their red sauce, I love to eat it with my rice or dip naan in it"}
{"text":"The food at Pamier Kabob is really quite good but the portions are not overly generous so to get a good quantity of food the price really starts to add up. This is really why we don't visit as often as we'd otherwise like. The value really isn't there."}
{"text":"First tried a bit of this place's food from its Brampton location, and when I saw the same place downtown I had to get some because the food was so good before. This location did not disappoint and is comparable from a food perspective. 

For group of 4, the mixed chicken kebab dinner is plenty! for $30.95 you get tandoori chicken, half roast chicken, chicken korma and chicken breast kebab. This also includes two naan, rice and salad. For an extra $2 the rice can be upgraded with almonds and raisins. Let me tell you, the extra cost is so worth it as the raisins and almonds are so delicious!

I'd really like to know how they get the chicken breast so tender cause I cannot reproduce it at home. My favorite is the tandoori chicken and then the chicken kebab! The Afghani Naan is not as soft as Indian naan, but it's still got some chewy texture.

This location is really for walkers. Driving here is a bit difficult cause there is no stopping in front. Walking in there aren't many people and the staff didn't appear to be doing much as my order was all ready by the time I got there. The staff could do with a bit more pleasantries, but perhaps they were bored?

in hope they get more business cause the food is delicious and dinner for 4 at $37 tax included is a steal!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  For some reason they despise customers.  Good food.  But a miserable experience.  Cheer-up people!"}
{"text":"We ordered Chapli kebab and chicken Korma with Naan , found chapli kebab to be mildly smelly due to warm weather , 
Korma was average as cooked in tomato gravy . Best part were the Naan , best in GTA.
Would try once more time ."}
{"text":"Great food, nice and clean environment. I was there during lunch time with my colleagues and had tried \"Tandoori Special\" - combination of Chicken Tandoori and Shamie Kabob (made from ground beef) which comes with Salad and Naan. Chicken tandoori was a little bit spicy but tasted awesome. Shamie Kabob tasted great too. Both were very tender and juicy. If you can't handle spicy food ask them to make it less spicy, or try it with Mango Lassi - this will help you cool your tongue. I will return soon to try the Fish Kabob (skinless and boneless salmon marinated in crushed chilli tandoori spices) - it looked delicious. During lunch time it gets busy very quickly. Try to make it just before noon to avoid the long lineup."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I highly recommend it. Every time we come here it's fresh and tasty. Plenty of parking in the front, although the place is a bit small. Worth the wait for take out!"}
{"text":"As for the dinners, they are also good but pricey. The food comes with a salad and nann, you can add rice to any meal for 2 dollars. You get a pile of rice for that 2 dollars.I usually visit here a couple times a month. I also love their curry chicken. The lamb chops are great but you only get 3 small ones. Check her out because I like it."}
{"text":"It's good. Nice seating area. Food is similar to bamiyan. However, Yet nothing beats bamiyan. Service is fine."}
{"text":"Pamier Kabob is an Afghan restaurant. Considering the fact that your previous choices for getting Afghan style kabobs consisted of (the amazing) Bamiyan and not much else, the fact this place opened up shop right downtown is more than a little awesome. The place has a little bit of a fast-food lunch time restaurant vibe. (It's very clean and very bright.) I've been a few times now, and it's been great each time. The food is very tasty, and the portions are gigantic. It's a tiny bit pricier than some of the other lunch options in the area, but not by much. If you go, get the Chaplee, which is a little bit spicy and a little bit wonderful. Also get the Bolanee. (You should always get Bolanee when you go to an Afghan restaurant. It's a potato/bread dish that will change your life forever.) This place is well worth checking out. It is definitely one of the best places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This is the worst salad I've probably ever seen in my entire life, honestly, this is mind blowingly bad

Putting a bunch of dehydrated, wilted, preservative laced dried out lettuce from a bag into a styrofoam container, laying 2 slimy tomatoes on top, and squirting it with nowhere near enough \"white sauce\" on top is NOT A SALAD.

Why do you even put this in the meal, honestly?  Would it kill you guys to use normal lettuce, chop your tomatoes, and actually DRESS your salad in a bowl before slopping it into a container?

This is the laziest shit I ever seen, I swear to God"}
{"text":"The place was somewhat empty. When you walk in, you won't see any signs on the wall to order. Do not fret! They have a brochure of food by the cashier. I walked in pretty confused, but we found out way to order. 

The place is pretty big, great for a big family coming in. The food is made fresh and the Shamie that I got was so juicy and tasty. I really enjoyed it and it was a good portion. The food came in about 10-15 minutes later, you order and pay right away and take your tray to your table. 

I would go back here again and I recommend it. It's a good place to hit up if you're craving Afghanistan food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken arugula salad is simple but amazing (chicken, arugula, olives, garlic vinaigrette with a side of maan). The naan is delicious, the chicken is mouth-watering and well-seasoned, and the price ($7.90) can't be beat in downtown Toronto. Everything I've tasted on the menu is delicious. The bolanee, for example, is a spicy and scrumprious, greasy potato pancake. Worth it for a treat! But I keep coming back for the salad."}
{"text":"So I have to revise mu review as after a while ai went back for some boulanee. The place has changed, amazing service the place is small and cozy with about 6 tables for some quick tasty food! The place was crazy busy at 7 pm on a Wednesday night! i had the boulanee, pudding dessert and a gigantic portion of the chicken soultani! Everything tasted incredible and the portions are very large for only 11$ per entree that comes with rice, salad and naan! Will definetely be back!!"}
{"text":"My work has ordered here a few times. The food is very good. But the service is usually anywhere from \"meh\" to very bad. 

Our orders more often than not are missing items. Our orders are never marked to distinguish what is what, and when we ask for clarification we can rarely get a clear answer.

Also the prices on the website are less than what you are charged when you are at the restaurant. So order online if you can. 

TL;DR: Great food. Lousy service.

Also, for those commenting on the dining room, this place used to be a Harveys."}
{"text":"Love their food!  A bit on the pricey side, but good portions. Food is cooked well. The staff are so-so. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"Update: I ordered takeout, they gave me bread that was not just stale, it had mold on it already."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the service is terrible.  I went here for lunch and was one of a handful of customers in the restaurant.  I placed my order and was given my order number of 20.  The first number that was called after I ordered was #17....  great, only a few more orders!  By the time order #26 was called it was clear that something was wrong, I understand that some orders take longer to cook and won't be called out in sequence...  but six orders and counting before mine is cooked?  Then, finally, #20 is called....  but I quickly realized that there was some sort of mix up and the woman had called my number to check if someone was waiting - clearly they had forgotten to put my order in.  Mistakes happen, I guess.  

You would think that my order would now be prioritized.  Another five orders came out before I asked the server what was taking so long.  She gave a lame excuse that they didn't have lamb marinated (why is it on the menu, then?) - clearly from my previous observation it was a lie.  No apology until I - giving them the benefit of the doubt - asked why they didn't tell me it would take so long when I ordered....  just a mumbled I'm sorry and another staff member franticly bringing my order out...  as they called number #32.  My entire time in the restaurant, on what was supposed to be me grabbing a quick lunch, was 30 minutes.  And after all that, the sauces that typically come with the meal weren't in the bag.

The meat was tasty, though...  from being marinated overnight.  So much for the excuse of not having marinated lamb."}
{"text":"Got denied at the Princess of Wales theatre for the Book of a Mormon lottery so was on the prowl for something delicious to sink my fangs into (I mean teeth)...

Ordered the chicken tandoori kebab - To Go. I was first in line so it couldn't take too too long to receive my food. 

Firstly, the place is quite modern. Clean and ample amount of seating. 

Bathroom was spotless, which is a nice touch. I used the accessible 'suite' - they take care of this usual issue. 

Food arrived - minimum 15 min wait. That means it's fresh...but wait. 

Arrived to my post order destination, opened the take out container, andddd...was disappointed. 

Firstly - way too much rice. Second - too little meat. Third - too little salad. 

Rice was under cooked. Abrasive to the bite. Usually I look forward to the salad but the salad was sloppy and disappointing. Tons of lettuce, little veg, and too much dressing. 

The meat - I've had really good BBQ chicken. But have you ever bitten into a chunk of chicken and questioned whether it was cooked or not. That's what I went through tonight. The left side of my brain said don't eat it - but the right side said eat it you fat pig. 

Honestly, I won't go back which is a shame. I've been here before and the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"I passed by this place a few times and dismissed it as a new location for some franchise.  Then I realized, there are no Afghan chains (at least, not to my knowledge)... so, given that I usually correlate deliciousness of cuisine with how wartorn a country history is, I figured I'll give it a shot... (What?  Too soon?)

Grabbed a lamb tikka (kebab) plate - which came to about $12 and came with rice, salad and sesame flatbread.  The lamb was nicely spiced and well cooked -- and the flatbread was very nice, fresh addition.

Pretty tasty - but don't like the fast food like exterior fool you.  Takes a while for them to cook the kebab and the cashier is the surliest dude I've met in a long time."}
{"text":"The food here is good quality.  It's clean (not much fat at all), and fresh.  The food doesn't have the 'fatty ' taste like the Nora stuff just up the street from here. The small salads are also quite fresh.  Nice use of herbs on the rice etc.  Can't to wrong with any of the dishes really.

It's only real flaw in my mind is this:  price.  It's rather expensive for what it is.  I think they could drop the ripoff hike on rice (+2 bucks for a bit of rice with seasoning on it?) and perhaps lower it a few dollars... then it would be considerably more viable.

This place tends to get very busy at lunchtimes (~12-2pm) on weekdays, so best go outside those hours during the day."}
{"text":"MUST TRY
Chicken Tandoori
Lamb Tikka

Delicious! Carnivores unite. I like the chicken tandoori and lamb tikka much better than the ground meat kebabs. 

Order the Tandoori special and/or Shahi if you want to try 2 types of kabob on the same platter.

The naan is good. I generally prefer other types of naan, but this one is soft. If you have leftovers, fry up the naan in a pan later and it's arguably better.

The food is even better with a garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I work nearby and this is my place of choice for lunch. I am a big guy and for me neither quantity or quality is a point I can forego. This place might have THE best fire-grilled meat I have ever tried! It's always juicy and the spices are ridiculously delicious! Best of all for $13 I can get a big meal and actually not end up hungry like I do in a lot of other places. If you haven't dined here yet you're really missing out!"}
{"text":"Good portions here so you will definitely be full after eating one of their plates. The taste is really great and the fresh flat bread or whatever it is called is great. I was almost full just eating that."}
{"text":"Customer service is really terrible at this place and the staff is not friendly. I would rather go to Bamiyan instead"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new, interesting joints to try during my all-too-short lunch hour and so it was that I spotted Pamier Kabob whilst walking up Spadina.

As one might've guessed, Pamier Kabob boasts a lot of kabobs on its menu. I felt like a wrap, though, so I got the Chicken Tikka Wrap. I was asked how spicy I wanted it (always a good sign) and then the wait began.

It seems like the restaurant favors orders fulfilled via Ritual over those placed in store, as they put out a whole lot of takeout orders before I received my food, but the wait wasn't too bad so this is a minor complaint.

The wrap is just okay. It contains several chunks of dispiritingly dry chicken (ie expect to do a lot of chewing) and a generous portion of lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. The sauce is too bland to even mention, and the spice level was just barely adequate.

But it's cheap and filling, at least."}
{"text":"Let me disclose I am from the States, specifically Philadelphia and Doner kebab places like this and the ones in Europe are non-existing so just getting one of these and satisfying my fix warrants this place 5 stars.  It may not be the \"best\" kebab out there but it was actually one of the tastiest, affordable, quickly prepared meals that I had in Toronto.  A kebab, potatoes and a can of soda for under $9."}
{"text":"i came here with friends on an outing. food is good. meat is really fresh and you can taste the grill.i order beef which is very flavorful and not dry at all.  naan is delicious, soft and a bit chewy which perfect for me.
 it has large dinning area which would be great for groups.  price wise i do wish it's a bit cheaper but it's worth of the quality.
my friend told me their rice used to be better, but i think it's quite good. 
service i would say ok, i am not picky on service as long as the server are not rude or ignoring me. 
if i live closer i would go back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and will definitely keep coming again and again. I savour very delicious and healthy cuisine at Pamier. I love their sumptuous Mixed Grill Platter; enables one to enjoy a variety of succulent meat items all in one plate. The young Afghan lady order-taker is very courteous, cheerful, and efficient. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. The interior is immaculately clean. Plenty of tables. Prime central location just off Hwy10, plenty of parking, bus stop shelters at doorstep for many frequent routes. Just one thing, the staff don't bring the wonderful food to your table if you dine in; you need to place order at counter and return to it when it's called out. The food is very yummy. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of Pamier for making my visits very enjoyable and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"This is my first eat at this place & likely won't be my last. Certainly not a fancy spot. In fact I got my entire meal for around $10 bucks. Not bad considering. I ordered the Chicken skewers w the beef paddy. Good size portion for the entire meal. Came with a delicious side bread as well. Very tasty BBQ flavour profile."}
{"text":"This place is located in a shop strip, so I did not expect much.  That being said....delicious.  The prices are appropriate for the quality and amount of food you receive.  The service is relatively quick for freshly prepared food.  The space is large and clean."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant each time I passed by this area and always wanted to try it 
The restaurant is clean with polite staff
The food is average  Chapli kebabs  are not that good 
Rest of the food was ok too"}
{"text":"I went here after reading the reviews.  I ordered the lamb tikka kabob and chicken kabob.  I think the lamb tikka was great.  Chicken was OK.  Nothing special.  I'll be going back for the lamb tikka at least once more while I'm in town for a few more weeks."}
{"text":"Great food. A few Afghan places I've been to, I found the meat was dry. These guys cook the meat perfectly and it's not dry at all. Rice is also amazing, I don't know what they put in it. Kind of pricey for a fast food type place but worth it. 

Definitely the best Afghan place I've had in the gta."}
{"text":"Of all the places me and my buddy Tim have tried in the Mississauga region we have unanimously agreed that this is the best Afghan food. And after years of asking they finally accept credit cards. Lol. Try the Karahi kabob with rice...you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Very similar to Watan Kabob in terms of taste and menu, after all both are Afghani.  Duh.  Atmosphere is much quieter, tucked away, and dimmer, so a bit more relaxing than the bustlin' Watan!  

There are some different items being offered at Pamier Kabob, re:  Shami Kabob, and the fish are filets of salmon, unless it's the \"kabob\" which appears to be some sort of filet white fish, but not a HUGE sea bass as Watan serves.  The price is more or less the same or $1-2 cheaper.  Still a really good value as you'll probably have leftovers, at least with the rice dishes.

We ordered a side of Bonalee which is described as \"pan fried stuffed with potatoes, herbs and spices\", but it was more like a roti/dosa with mashed up potatoes on the inside and it was spicy!

Pamier Kabob also offers both the Red/White Sauce.  White Sauce seems thicker, but tastes more or less the same.  Red Sauce is on the hotter side, so be aware.  The side salad at Pamier is slices, as opposed to diced tomatoes/cucumbers.  No biggie.

Not in my 'hood, but a great alternative if you find yourself near the Costco on Ridgeway/Dundas area of the border of Miss/Oakville!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, cooked to order and really good. Rice cooked to perfection. Naan needs to be upgraded but overall a really good value."}
{"text":"Very good quality and quantity of kabobs. I have been to other afghani place, and this is on top of my list for Afghani good.

Do try there Beef Platter to get to taste various kabobs"}
{"text":"The most terrible service ever. My wife and I visited this place and eat only chicken. They don't direct you to a table and don't give a menu - so we stood in line. 2 Afghan ladies were extremely chatty that we were not given any attention while trying to order our dishes. I found it extremely rude. And when I asked how Tandoori Special tastes - she is like I don't know. I retorted saying well you work here. She didn't care and went back to chatting with her friend. In the end, she didn't take down the order for Tandoori special but only took the order for Half Chicken kabob for my wife. Later we inquired and were told you guys were chatty and confused while standing at the counter. WOW! These Afghans have no concept of customer service. Moving on, the overhead menu says CHICKEN in big but some of the dishes underneath have beef. We weren't told - I accidentally found a copy of the brochure menu and then asked them to change. The cashier lady was vehement is saying \"you should have checked\"? I am like \"No, should not be writing combo dishes under a chicken menu\". She continued to argue in bad tone and threw $2 back at me. I have to say that's the most disgusting service I have even gotten. Lastly, the food was not even good. The dishes were not even spicy with they say are spicy and the naan was made in haste. Bamiyon Kabob is wayyyyy better than this sick-ass place. F- for them."}
{"text":"Came here for take-out during lunch break.

The food was super oily, but it tasted fantastic. I don't remember what I got but they put a poster of it on the wall, it was a stir-fry with onions, tomatoes, peppers, and a meat of your choice.

The wait was surprisingly long, which I guess could be considered a good thing - they grill the meat as it's ordered, rather than cooking it ahead of time. The bread also tasted like it was fresh out of the oven.

I like this place, will come again.

EDIT: Had to come back to edit the rating, had a bad experience on the toilet just now. The food was worth 4 stars, overall experience 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazingly simple bit delicious food. CHICKEN CHAPLEE KEBAB is just amazing. Great pls e. Highly recommend ."}

The staff is nice and fast its a plus ... Very good for take out, generous portions !"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Afghani/desi joint in this part of Toronto. The food is amazing, the rolls, the kabobs with REAL basmati rice - cooked to perfection. The food is very authentic and the portions sizes are very decent, I was unable to finish mine. If you haven't had Afghani food before - you will fall in love once you try this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shahi Chicken kebab. Very delicious...a little spicy but I like spicy. Comes with salad and naan or rice. Chicken was very tender and not dry."}
{"text":"I think about this place as Premier Kabob, because the kababs are definitely very premier quality!

It's a pretty small, clean, no frills establishment. Almost feels like ordering at a food court counter. They have a paper menu but also have everything written above the cash counter, you order, go back to your seat and return to take your food on plastic trays! The meat combinations are pretty extensive; my eyes watered staring at the back lit board trying to figure out what to order. I finally went with the lamb kabobs, bread and salad. My friend ordered the fish and rice. It's not as cheap as you'd think it would be, given the whole set-up.

We could smell them cook our food, the spices they use are flavorful and very fragrant! I loved the meat: juicy, tender and flavorful and the bread was amazing: warm, crisp and with the right amount of sesame! My friends salmon was really, really good: crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and so flavorful. You could feel the excess spices hit your tongue as you bit into the fish! The rice was super delicious as well. The garden salad was just meh in comparison and felt like an after thought. 

We were plenty full and satisfied after our trip, though a bit smelly on the subway ride back home. I bet that the other riders probably thought,  \"Damn, that smells delicious!\"

The food strictly is 4 star worthy, rest of the restaurant space is very sterile, no-frills 2-3 stars worthy. Much better for take out than for a dine-in experience."}
{"text":"I work close to this place and frequent for lunch and dinner.   The food is good especially the chicken. The team behind the counter is dedicated and friendly. I usually l get my order in 5 min or less even when it's busy. I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"All I have to say is wear a bib because the mouth watering juices do tend to fly off the table at this joint!!I walked in here, on Spadina, without any expectations and what I received was uber satisfaction :-D 
Came around lunch time ordered Beef Chapli Kabob, Beef Karahi, and Beef Sultani kabob, was advised all meals come with salad or Kulcha bread and or you can add rice for extra price, I also ordered Firni (dessert), with tax and all total came to $42.00 not bad.. I got my ticket number which said #61 and at the moment they were calling #25, so I grabbed a seat with my friends...Did I mention this place was packed...and waited patiently...

So now the verdict:

1) Chapli Kabob: ahhhhhhhmazing flavourful, Chapli Kanbob were like beef patties but grilled and cooked minced stacked to perfection. They came with a Kulcha bread with sesame seeds, nice warm salty/sweet (difference between naan bread and kulcha bread is naan is made in tandoor, is bland, while kulcha bread is baked and is a little sweeter)

2) Beef Karahi: OMG GOOD! Like mutton Lahori Karahi (desi Yelp readers you know what I am talkin about) extremely tasty, I ordered it spicy, flavours were bursting out of my mouth, great chunks of beef, with sweet melody of tomatoes, oil, green peppers and spicy, taste ahhhmazing with Kulcha bread.

3) Sultani Kabobs: juicy juicy flavourful juicy tasted great with rice!

4) Firni: OMG you could taste the 100% cream and milk in this sweet custard like cold dessert, no 2% dairy milk in this perfectly sweet concoction of east meets west!! Tastes amazing if you dip your hot Kulcha bread in it...trust me you will thank me for dipping your bread in it!!

Ahhhhh am stuffed :-D"}
{"text":"I would like to give this location 0 star.
We ordered a bunch of grilled meats for takeout- we specifically asked them for no beef, and were assured the items did not contain beef.
When we got home, we realized the person at the counter had sold us mostly beef kebobs!
This lazy behaviour is completely unacceptable and we def won't be back."}
{"text":"Good place! I like the selection of good food options. Ordered the kabob plate. Came with a lot of rice, good quality beef, and a small salad, and a piece of Naan. I didn't like that they don't give you any humus with the food...every middle eastern restaurant needs humus with their dishes! Hey we're able to provide hot sauce and some garlic mayo. I also had the freshly squeezed lime juice, a delicious add on. I would return to this place again."}
{"text":"We only discovered this place last year even though we've lived in the area since way before it opened. A friend recommended it, so we gave it a try.

You have to order at the counter and then wait until your number is called. There are plenty of seats and tables if you want to eat in and the place is very clean and tidy.

The portions are fairly generous, especially the rice and salad. The rice is delicious and the salad is always very fresh.

We've had variations of lamb, beef, chicken and fish and all have been good. The food is tasty although the kabobs can be a bit on the dry side.

The beef qorma is just okay, not too bad but not as tasty as it could be.

We haven't tried the wraps, but I've been with friends who have and they say they're delicious and very generous portions for the price.

All in all, it's a great place to pop into for take out when you haven't thought of what to make for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here twice already, and highly recommend it for the regular carnivorous diner! Pretty much everything on the menu is worth raving about, but the beef kebabs and lamb chops are especially nommers! 

The food is fairly priced ($11-12 can get you a decent sized meal), and the large and spacious restaurant provides plenty of room to move around. A few sets of extra long tables make it an ideal environment for a large dining group.

I've only ever been here for lunch, and the restaurant has never been that busy....so can't say what dinner service is like. Still, the kebabs are worth the wait.

There's no waiter service, so make sure you keep an ear out for that bell!"}
{"text":"Chicken Chaplee kebabs are hard to find. Mouth watering, delicious and sizzling ones are a plain rarity. Fortunately, we found a place which serves them with buttery flavoured rice with freakishly huge portion. And for the price they charge, it's a damn good deal.

There is no table service which is quite alright since it's not a huge establishment. But, despite being an open kitchen, there is no odour or greasy edges to be found anywhere. Place is as tidy as it can be.

Now only if I could muster up a will to try something else on their menu, that would be something!"}
{"text":"Good food just like bamiyan. A little overpriced just like every other Persian place.
Chaplee kabob is good"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and baby for a quick dinner as we were out with our 3 month old.  I typically get the tandoori chicken wrap when I hit up afghan kebab shops and today was no exception. Now, when i say tandoori chicken, don't think Indian food, the spice combination is totally different, unique and delicious. The wrap is topped with lettuce, cucumbers, red onion and tomato. There is also the sauces they put on it which is a creamy cool sauce along with a spicy pepper sauce (optional).  All in all a delicious quick home cooked meal I would suggest This spot"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong on the menu here.
The Nan is very good as well.
I usually go with Lamb options just because ... well, it's lamb.
It's a simple set up and you don't wait too long."}
{"text":"Delicious M-E-A-T

Pamier Kabob is a new Afghan restaurant that just opened up on Spadina near Adelaide. Apparently they have a Brampton location too.

I have no freakin' idea if this is authentic or traditional Afghan fare, but the food was really tasty. The menu consists mainly of kabobs. I've never seen so many variations of kabob on one menu - chicken kabobs, beef kabobs, lamb kabobs, fish kabobs and a few vegetarian selections. You can buy them as wraps ($4.99) or combo plates ($8.99-$11.99)  that come with salad, rice and Afghani naan bread.

Bonus points for having a very healthy menu - lots of salads and grilled meats. Plus the combo plates are cheaper if you don't want to include rice, which is great for carbo-phobes!

I tried the Tandoori special (1 skewer of tandoori chicken and 1 skewer of the ground beef kabob). The meat was very, very tender and not overcooked. Not too spicy but some sauces were served if you wanted to spice it up. I really like the Afghani naan bread - it's paper thinand not too filling, good for wrapping up bits of meat.

Portion was absolutely huge. I took a full half home (next day lunch!)

Considering this place just opened, they have the kitchen and service NAILED! The server clearly knew what she was doing and the kabob-maker guy wasn't messing around either.

They have a nicely renovated interior and very clean bathrooms. You order from the front cash and sit to wait for your food at a table; they bring it out. So more of a lunch spot destination than for dinner."}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite with a love for kebobs, then this place is for you. Although a fast food style/cafeteria type restaurant, the food (and the portions) are great!

Prices are also very reasonable for what you get. Meals automatically come with a small side salad and a large piece of Afghani flat bread. For an extra $2 you can add rice to your dish. Not recommended if you're on lunch and have a busy work schedule afterwards, as you'll want to take a big nap after this huge meal.

Service is fast, efficient, and friendly for the most part. If you're new to Afghani food, and have questions about the dishes, it's best to go for after the lunch crowd, or for dinner. 

They have a wide selection of kebobs, with different ways of prepared meats (lamb, beef, and chicken)."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the portions are generous but it's hard to find a clean table as they never seem to wipe them when people leave. And there's always a new cashier (high staff turnover usually means the owners are nasty) so it takes them forever to ring up the order while you're staffing at the cash."}
{"text":"Excellent food, order st the counter and then take a seat, but completely made to order. I had the lamb kabobs, they were excellent!"}
{"text":"I got the sultani kebob dinner and it was quite good. Fresh, cook to order meats seasoned perfectly.  As good as this is I still like Bamiyan Kebob more though."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Probably the best deal for lunch downtown. Everything is super fresh! Good, affordable prices. Staff are super cool and friendly. Rice is killer! A definite go to when on Spadina."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef kabob. It was delicious and mostly tender. I got to try a bit of the chicken too, which I didn't like as much. It also came with salad and a lot of naan bread. I also ordered rice as the add-on, it was pretty tasty too. The prices are higher than other fast food places, but the portions are huge too."}
{"text":"When I hear \"kabob joint\" I usually think of a hole in the wall with years of painted over walls, missing floor tiles and indifferent service. Pamier Kabob is something different. It's clean and well-decorated (dare I say, almost classy) and has quality customer service. I was impressed by my visit to this shop at Spadina and Adelaide.

Though I ordered my meal to go, it's quite splendid inside by kabob-shop standards. The floors are large-format porcelain tiles and there is stacked stone on the walls. There is PLENTY of seating here too, which makes it a reliable lunch spot for those working nearby.

There are a jaw-droppingly staggering amount of options. Can we get a nerd to do the math?[1] You can choose your protein (chicken, beef, lamb or fish) and your style of kabob. Most come with sides, and give you an option to add rice for a few bucks. I ordered the Shahi Lamb Kabob ($10.99) which comes with naan and salad. As a special bonus it also came with a spicy beef chaplee kabob -- like a round spicy burger. I devoured it with reckless abandon. I was impressed with how soft the afghani naan was and the meat was really flavourful and tender.

If I had restraint[2] and saved the rest for later, it would have doubled the value proposition of this place. As it is, it's still a great value for the quality of service and fare you'll get here. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: KABOB'S your uncle.[3]

Menu Readability: Overwhelming. There are some 50 types of kebob to choose from.

Need to mention: I ordered lamb, but got a beef surprise with it. This is worth checking up on if you are particular about this kind of thing. (I am not.)

What this place teaches me about myself: I have no idea what \"Pamier\" means. It could mean \"death to infidels\" and I'd probably still eat here.

{"text":"The best chicken kabobs I've had. Perfectly cooked and tender. And the bread is delicious and fresh. So happy I found this hidden gem. It's usually been quite empty when I've come by - deserves more publicity!"}
{"text":"It's my first day in a new office in downtown Toronto and where do I go? The food here is pretty good. I had the chicken kabob tandoori. On their menu, the spiciness level goes up to 2, and the chicken kabob tandoori has a spiciness level of 1. This is easily a 4 on a 5-star spiciness level. The meal comes with salad and a large piece of naan. I thought that the naan was the best part of the meal, and I'd consider ordering only the naan. They're baked fresh right on the premises. It's $2 extra for rice and I feel like there's enough food to not justify ordering rice. I wish there was an option to substitute the salad for the rice."}
{"text":"Was here end of Nov 2011 and it seemed like the had just finished renovating - the place looked brand new!

We ordered and the food took a while to come (not too long) - a good sign if you ask me. A sign that they're preparing it fresh.

Food came and everything we had was delicious! The chicken would melt in your mouth, the rice was perfectly cooked and we were so full - the portions are big!

I'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was perfect. A good balance of meat carbs and veggies at a good price. One of my friends only complaint was a the lack of a waiter or waitress but I think it's a good thing because it helps keep the prices low. Only real problem here is the bad attitude the short slender woman at the cashier has. Today she got into an argument with a customer and they started cussing (f words and Afghanistan cuss words) back and forth very loudly. Great place minus that woman."}
{"text":"Good kebabs. fresh salad. Can't comment on the rice, however the kids loved the naans.

(Good place to visit if you're maintaining a low carb diet)."}
{"text":"The meat here is very good, dare I say ... \"delicious\".   Just based on taste alone, I'd say the meat is 4 / 5 stars.  Unfortunately, there are other considerations for a restaurant, and I have to rate this place 2 out of 5 stars.  I would never come back.  This is why.

What do you get with your delicious meat?  You have two options: a \"high option\" and a \"cheap option\".   In a weird twist of fate which would make even Hugo Ball burst out, screeching with laughter, the low option comes with \"Naan\" while the expensive high option comes with rice.

Yes, you read that right, biatches!  The rice option is more expensive than the naan option.  Put that into your peace pipe and smoke it!

I went for the low options since I love naan.  Not this naan.  This naan is disgusting.  It's nothing more than a tortilla.  A stale, tasteless tortilla.  Really disgusting.

The salad is nothing more than some iceberg lettuce and tomato.  That's it.  Not much of a salad.

The girl who took my order was more concerned with her cellphone than taking my order (she was telling her friend how to tell if a guy likes her or not).

Hey, Pamier Kebob, I have some suggestions for you:

1. Honestly, your food is a bit too pricey for what it is.  Add a bit more meat.  $12 for a few pieces of great tasting meat is unreasonable.

2. Ixnay the \"naan\".  It's awful.   Or improve it.  Seriously, it's terrible.

3. WHY IN THE WORLD DO YOU CHARGE EXTRA FOR RICE?!?   If you want my advice, get rid of the \"high option\" and \"low option\".  Just offer your great meat, some rice, and a little salad for $12.  Then your food would be well priced and a good value.  And more delicious.  Rice would add what, a whole extra 10 cents to your bottom line?

4. Tell your cashier girl to get off her cellphone when she's serving customers.  We are tired.  We are hungry.  While her conversation was amusing, after a full day of work, I really just want to kick back in my hotel room.

5. Would adding some extra stuff to your salad be *that* costly to your bottom line?"}
{"text":"This is a just-opened location of a small chain, and everything looks absolutely new and fresh. Wondering for how long would it hold?

Prices are a bit elevated for a \"ten bucks take-out lunch\", and portions are not that big. Sides are enormous, though. Kabob without side will leave you hungry. Kabob with side will fill you for the rest of the day (making your order fourteen bucks instead of ten). And there are lots of kabobs to chose from - I liked the menu.

Quality of food is decent - I absolutely loved the flatbread, and kabobs, sauces, rice and salads are on par with the rest of lunch places around this block. Not a restaurant level, but a good lunch take-out.

Dining room is reasonably spacious, so you can drop-in with a bunch of friends and still find some place - just not in a middle of the day.

Service is friendly, though I've noticed in two occasions that cashier girl was clearly a trainee. Still, positive and helpful one - and there is nothing wrong with someone learning. It is a newly-opened location, after all.

Waiting time was quite noticeable for the times I've been there, so if you are in rush and need your food immediately - that might not be a good choice.

But overall looks like Pamier is a good competition for a well-proven Nora shawarma on the corner of the same block. That's good - more choices available."}
{"text":"Food was good but staff was rude and it was a bit chaotic and very slow. Didn't get utensils and everything I needed. I had to keep getting up to get stuff. Overall, wasn't a good experience. It was fast food, grabbed while shopping so it's not like I had huge expectations. But unfriendly staff just sucks and can ruin any dining experience. So many other restaurants around, I would just choose something else next time. There was also a big leak in the fridge where the drinks were and no one seemed concerned about attending to it, even after we notified them. It was right by where I had to stand to order, so it was just not a great experience. Meh isn't even really accurate, I would say this was full on ugh."}
{"text":"I am going to rate this place in comparison to Waton Kabob and Bamiyan Kabob.

I had their shahi kabob which was a skewer of chicken and one chaplee kabob. Both were good. Only that the beef had a very slight distinct smell to it. Most people might not be able to distinguish good quality meat, I can. 
The chicken skewers were good but could've been just a tad bit more juicy.
The white dipping sauce could definitely use more flavoring.

If Waton kabob is a 10, Bamiyan is a 9.5, this place is an 8.0/8.5

The service was quick. The pricing and portion size was good."}
