{"text":"My go-to fast food hamburger joint. Much as I love Fat Boy's pineapple-packing Hawaiian burger, or a good Fatburger on the char (always order on the char), Freddy's hits the sweet spot for me in price, distance, consistency, and drink selection (I like Wild Cherry Pepsi; your own mileage may vary). I can say that some days are better than others, but overall it gets my highest marks. I very much love the maillard crusting along the skirt of the thin double patties; it's good proof that you don't need a flame grill to make a great burger."}
{"text":"Came here with my kiddos while my husband was shopping in Harbor Freight and I have to say I was surprised my how delicious their simple grilled cheese was. The burgers are great too... I love this place."}
{"text":"The burgers are too thin and too boring to be so expensive. Don't really want my meat to crunch either. I gave it two chances but now I'm out."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their burgers and fries, they are so good. The people behind the counter are very nice too."}
{"text":"Got order wrong. When I brought it to the counter, the manager decided to debate me (fyi, always best to just please a customer so they don't have to come on here and leave a poor review). Finally tbey corrected it even though I paid more than I should have due to their mistake."}
{"text":"Im OBSESSED with the concretes!!!!!!!!! It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Had a great hamburger there and service was excellent would highly recommend. And be sure to try the ice cream shakes."}
{"text":"Burger was just ok. A little greasy. I'd still pick In-N-Out for a fast food burger.  

BUT, lets talk about their concretes. I had the peanut butter concrete and that was just soooo good. 2 days later, I was still thinking about it. 

Good place to stop in for dessert."}
{"text":"I'd give this shop zero stars because they always are very slow and find hair in my food and custards. it is disgusting and wastes my money. Not going back to this one."}
{"text":"Great first meal at Freddy's, the burgers and chicken fingers are truly awesome!  Everyone loves the fries.  Since Freddy was a WW2 veteran, I am proud to say we are customers for life.  Chris the GM IS FANTASTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"Good custard and steak burgers. Chicken is a tad small on sandwiches. Have gotten home and had to lift the bread several times to see if chicken was even in there. Not on my list of places to visit when hungry."}
{"text":"First time I came here I had a cheeseburger. Very good but will order a double next time, patty was very thin. Next time I had a hot dog. O....M...G!! Fantastic! They serve it on texas toast which adds to the flavor of the hot dog. Next visit I ordered a chili cheese dog no onions. WHOA!!! I didn't think the hot dog could taste any better but it did!!! I like the shoestring fries. I tried chili cheese fries but they not only use shredded cheese but also the cheese sauce, I could do without the sauce. Overall I love Freddy's!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Come for the custard, steer clear of the rest.

Location was clean  = 1 star
Staff was friendly and prompt = 1 star
Food execution = 0 stars

Burger patties are thinner than the pickles., they missed adding cheese to my burger as ordered. The only thing thinner than the patty was the fries.

Chicago style dog did not fit on the bun and and fell apart while trying to eat.

Do yourself a favor and eat at Five guys around the corner and just come for custard."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place and so glad we did. It was clean, service was great, food was very good,  and every staff member was cheerful and genuinely looked like they were happy to be there. I was also impressed to see the manager working alongside his staff. I saw him working in the kitchen, helping customers at the register, and then saw him walking the floor and greeting customers. He even checked in on our table just to be sure everything was alright. Had a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our trip to Freddy's was awesome! We came in about 25 min to closing and being from the Bay Area, we had no idea what to expect. Camille, the associate at the register, recommended numbers 1,3,5,6 as they were the most popular amongst other customers. She was super patient and courteous and gave us her honest opinion when asked questions. She and her colleague Javier were such nice people! You don't find a lot of those traveling.

Overall, the food was delicious! It was like an In n Out away from home. We were a party of 5 and we each enjoyed our food. We also got the concrete frozen custard and that was the cherry on top (pun intended because they came with cherries on top)!

Camille, Javier, the manager Gaby, and everyone that worked tonight that were great to us and definitely made our experience in Arizona a great one. :) Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we have been to a Freddy's. We decided to stop here after searching Yelp for a place to have a hamburger in Henderson. We were not disappointed. The  burgers were fabulous, the French fries were awesome and the custard was just as great! My favorite part of the meal was the fry sauce. I covered every inch of my large portion of fries in the sauce! The cashier who took our order was helpful and friendly and helped us first timers out. Someone stopped by our table to check on us and came back with a sample of custard since we told her this was our first time."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Freddy's, first time trying the actual food not just custard, and it was very good! The burger was great; it has a buttery sort of taste on the bun, which makes it delicious! It was very busy though, but still didn't take to long to cook the food. Overall this was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is totally awesome. You can go in there and pay as much as you would at McDonald's but get so much better quality food. The hamburgers are delicious, thin and crispy with a taste that leaves you wanting more. They have a french fry sauce that is divine and a must when eating their perfectly cooked skinny fries. All I can say is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"What can I say? There food is excellent best  ANGUS BURGERS I've had ever! With that being said I've only got the correct order 2 out of 15 times, through the drive-thru so far. 

   Obviously with me continuing to go back, that tells you how good their food is! Be aware though you MUST check your order before pulling off. Oh! Their Root-Beer floats are also Bar-none."}
{"text":"Good place for yummy custard.  Like the turtle concrete. Beowulf recommend the fries with Freddy sauce.  It's really good together."}
{"text":"Ordered the #1. Burger was delicious. Patties are super thin...... never had a patty like this before.....loved it! Shoestring fries were were crispy and well seasoned. Root beer was not mixed properly, but who cares since the food was so damn good! I definately  recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL!!! This place contracts with a private towing company to tow cars that they deem are \"illegally\" parked. We were parked legally and when we came out after eating dinner, our car was towed! We tried to straighten it out with the towing company, to no avail. We got nothing but attitude and had to pay $300 to get our car back. Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the single cheeseburger, double patty melt, Hawaiian, and peanut butter cup with banana sundaes.  Sandwiches were very tasty and flavorful. The fries were cooked to the perfect crisp, and the custards were delicious and smooth. The entire staff was polite and helpful. We felt very welcomed and comfortable during our visit. Thanks for the hospitality and good food. We'll be back if we pass through this area again."}
{"text":"After posting my initial review I received a message from a Freddy's executive.
We had a great chat.
I have to leave my rating the same, as I have not been back yet, but the exec asked me nicely to return, as they have fixed purveyor and employee problems... hope so!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, good custards, the drive thru is sometimes slow even when there isn't many people in the drivethru.....Maybe busy inside...."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here are ok.  Personally, I prefer Culvers, but they are very similiar.  
My problem with this place is that I had to return my food due to finding a big black curly hair stuck to my food.  I know it happens, no biggie, but I do expect someone to offer an apology.  The manager came over to assist with the refund, but failed to offer any sort of an apology.  Actually, he failed to say anything to me at all.  I don't know about anyone else out there, but after spending $40 on burgers and fries for 4, I like to know that my business is appreciated.  And in this case, they did not do that.  And for that reason, I wont be back."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned American food! Had the California steak burger, the way they grilled it left a delicious crispy crust on the beef. The custard is very delicious too!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Worst burger ever!!!! Paper   thin!!!  Tasted  weird also!! Didn't realize you have to order a double or triple in order to get some beef the single burger also gad something all around it??? I believe these rave reviews are fake either that or a lot of people in Henderson don't have any taste when it comes to burgers I will stick with in and out burgers!! At least they are juicy and flavorful and you can taste the beef lol"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is one of the very few places I can find a great steakburger. Being from Illinois, this is where I go when I'm craving Steak-n-Shake since there are none in AZ."}
{"text":"I guess I was lucky my first time at Freddy's. Got the #3 - Chicago dog with everything. Fries good, pepsi a bit wet on outside (yeah was overfilled and wiped), but the dog's bun was split. Is that normal? It's not for me then. Onions were cold, not room temp, so that just helped the dog cool down by the time I got to it. Shouldn't have to rush to eat a dog to get it hot. Of course, then the fries would have been cold. Thin fries cool faster then normal sized ones, so that was my first choice. I'll give it's burgers a try sometimes, but won't prioritize. If I want a good Chicago dog i'll go to Sonic or Tom's BBQ both in my area."}
{"text":"The cashiers are really nice. My chicken tenders were cold but they fixed it for me. I hate complaining but they didn't make it weird haha. The dining area is clean and while it did take them some time to make our food it was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"First,  I would like to say that the staff was exceptional ..,there customer service was amazing. 
Anyways.... we order the double steak burger California style with chili cheese fries. The burger was by far one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The chili cheese fries are to die for. ..
Overall great Service and Amazing Food and Good Prices cant beat that!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to eat chili there on my break and take it to go and they forgot about my order and it took basically my whole break waiting on the chili and then after I ate it I was throwing up and now I feel like shit. Thanks .."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries. Their milkshakes are awesome! It is just as good to go. Way better than Steak and Shake!"}
{"text":"Very salty burgers! Overall it's a nice place. A bit more expensive than their competitor Steak and Shake.  Steak and Shake won't charge you for toppings you don't want either."}
{"text":"I had never had a steak burger until I came here. It was different but I was impressed. The food was great! Especially the fry sauce. I like the atmosphere. It had more of a \"diner\" kind of feel to it rather than being at a fast food joint. The staff there was friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back. It would be awesome if Freddy's open up another location near the Summerlin area or somewhere on the west side."}
{"text":"I had a hamburger fries and a coke it was really really good it was a nice change from the usual hamburger chains the burger was nice and juicy and I like shoestring french fries again its a nice change I recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Freddy's, I go to the one at concord mills pretty often. So when this location opened so close to my house, I was very excited. 

Sadly, every time I've gone the service is incredibly slow, even when no one is there, and the food is just okay."}
{"text":"Me and my buds come to Freddy's often and are NEVER disappointed! We love the service and the burgers! I got to recommend the California Burger. I really stress that you give Freddy's a try, it is probably the best chain restaurant in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Um good .com .org .net! The meat is really flaky (that's a good thing) so get a double of whatever you get! The shoe lace fries are really good and you get a lot. Customer service is top notch too!"}
{"text":"I came for the custard. Being from Milwaukee, the unofficial custard capitol, I know what good custard tastes like. 

This stuff tastes like frozen yogurt.

At least they aren't as bad as Luv-It, which doesn't seem to understand that frozen custard is only supposed to be 3% egg yolk, not 30%!

I'd flip right now for some Leon's or Kopp's or even omega or gillie's. Freddies doesn't cut it. 

I'd rather drive to st George to pick up some Culver's than come back here."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place no matter the location.  It's a must that you get a double because patties are thin.  Order it like they serve it...stop being picky anyway!  The fries are amazing...thin shoe string fries!  Order an extra basket of fries to share with your table.  May as well order a cone to go for the ride home.  In PHX you gotta eat that fast...frozen custard to go in 110 degrees.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I want to say this is a travesty to say the least I ordered a burger number 1 with everything and asked for lettuce . Guess what the charge is ( 15 ) cents for lettuce go figure . The price is 749 for a burger and fries , no senior discount or courtesy cup or veterans discount. They profess that there veterans of the second wwar in the franchise with pictures I'd like to tell veterans to GO to IN and OUT for a better buy withe everything on it plus onions tomatoes LETTUCE and a great taste . I told you at this Freddy's I've got a big mouth and u hope someone is listening . I have it one star because they had the airconditioning on . Save ur money"}
{"text":"Went here the day they opened, expecting something at least on par with In-n-Out. Boy, was I disappointed. The burger was falling apart on the bun, and not in a good way, a la the meat being tender. No, there were small bits falling off from the burger, which itself was dry and lacking flavor, even with cheese and bacon on it. The fries? Whoever thought shoestring fries was a good idea needs to be fired. Worst fries I ever had, overcooked and under-seasoned. I would understand this if they were insanely busy on opening day, but they weren't. Aside from a couple other families, we were the only ones in the shop.

The only thing saving this place from one-star purgatory is the custard. Got a lot of it for the price; cone was huge, custard was delicious, but I suppose that's hard to screw up. With two other great places on Bell to get a delicious burger, I'm never coming back here. Very disappointing waste of money."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard a lot about Freddy's and decided to give it a try. On our arrival the dinning room was busy adding to my anticipation.

I ordered the #1 which is Freddy's original double burger with cheese. When it arrived I was disappointed with the portion.  Where's the beef! Although the burger was flavorful the patties were similarly sized as cold cuts. There was way more bun than burger.

Freddy's is a good choice and I would return if I was on the area. However, with that said I would not drive out of my way as I was disappointed."}
{"text":"excited that they came to the high desert (victorville) however not immpressed with burgers.Service  was good (NO IN & OUT) but unorginized.Orders kept getting messed up -but will go back for hot dogs and custard. Watch out! Edges are sharp in sitting booths too!"}
{"text":"Good service and the food is good. The french fries are great. The food was out fast and correct. 
The only downside would be that they have Pepsi products (preference)."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good haven't had a bad experience yet always gets the food out and the employees are very polite burgers are delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time in had a burger and fries. They were ok. The second time had a hot dog here. It tasted ok but made me feel pretty sick later. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The burger I had was a little dry but the fries were great.  I didn't try the ice cream but it does look really good, I will go back to try that.  The prices were very reasonable.  It was about $13 for my son and I to eat.  He got a double cheese burger meal.  I got a single burger fries and no drink because they don't have a sugar/caffeine free option.  I can't handle caffeine late and I really don't need the sugar in the evening either so I had water."}
{"text":"Solid little sit down spot, when you feel like dining in for some decent food but want something better than a fast food joint.

I've had the steak burger, a little thin on the patty, but great flavor and prepared well.

The chili cheese dog was ok and the chicken tenders are solid.

Custard was pretty good, think it's something that I'll have to get used to.

Now to my favorite item, the chili cheese fries, they're awesome.  Great tasting chili with nacho cheese sauce on the top of some shoestring fries. Could eat just those for a meal, great portion size.

Staff is great. Saw manager and assistant manager walking through bussing the tables and checking on  customers.

It's a \"go to\" spot for me."}
{"text":"One of the best damn burgers in the Phoenix area. It's right there with in-n-out and 5 guys! The fries are awesome. I didn't know they
 made shoestrings that thin. The only problem is that there aren't a bunch of Freddys all over the place."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! Love that they season the fries! A new go to place for fast-food!"}
{"text":"Burger: Excellent
Cheese Fries: Addicting
Turtle Custard Sundae: Best reason to go back!  

Arrived around 8:00 PM, food was ready in minutes, ate outside, and will now have to roll myself home!  Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"1st visit was very pleasant. The staff were all friendly and made sure we were taken care of. And of course the food was great! Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Fries were very good & they give you plenty of them.  Hot fudge sundae was tasty. I'd return."}
{"text":"Very good food and I love how this place gives young workers experience :) I'm a dessert LOVER and I had the mint concoction and it was so yummy!  

Not a fan of their fries but my kids enjoyed this place.  They have so much to choose from and overall make good food.  I seldom eat eat burgers but when I do I like burger joints like this.  Nice place and big enough for the family..."}
{"text":"Food could have been better. It was all pretty much what you would expect from a chain burger joint. 

My problem was the service. Chick working the drive through had an attitude, which isn't a huge deal to me except that it took forever to get our food. And you would think \"well, that should mean its fresh off the grill\" except it wasn't. It was borderline cold."}
{"text":"This fast food spot reminds me of a cross between In 'N Out and 5 & Diner based on appearance and was great for the large group I came with. Even though they are known for their steakburgers, (which people around me said was yummy) I highly suggest the Patty Melt. It was certainly one of the best patty melts I've had in a long time. Equally yummy were the seasoned shoestring fries (incredibly addicting).

Definitely recommend. I will be returning to try what they are known for --they're frozen custard!"}
{"text":"If you don't like the burgers or fries here you better just stick with your favorite, Burger King right? By far the best. Even a tad better than In n Out."}
{"text":"The food is pretty ok. I love when fries actually taste like the potatoes they once were. They gave me a free pint of custard for our 20min wait, which wasn't all that long considering they were busy however they didn't keep up on cleaning the tables or sweeping...dirty."}
{"text":"we love Freddys food.. however tonight we went here and my husband ordered pattymelt the #8 which is fries and drink included and \"side of cheese curds\" when we got the order there were no fries just the cheese curds.. they charged mind you full price for the #8 which was 8.59 and extra for the cheese curds my husband went up and said no fries? no manger said its 2.00 more the cheese curds! what? never offered to give him the fries just said way it is.. So im giving Freddys a bad review for customer service not the food. Shame on you the manger.!!  I WAS NOT HAPPY! :(  I ORDERED A KIDS MEAL OUR MEAL COST 17.00 BUCKS. COULD HAVE WENT TO A RESTURANT FOR THAT.  Just ticked me off. 
Cindy K."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Especially if you love steak, but are on a hamburger budget.  The Hamburgers come on a soft bun, and are cooked well.  The paddy's are thin, so if you are hungry I would start with a double at least.  The fries were well-seasoned and the onion rings were crispy.  The prices are very reasonable and you will definitely leave satisfied with the main course.  And then...  there is the frozen custard.  Be advised that your eyes will be bigger than your stomach here.  The small is probably plenty for most and too much for others.  The selection is great as well.  So far, I've had the Turtle and the PBB&C sundae, both were delicious and are highly recommended.  This is probably my favorite burger place in town and is a must try."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger joint. TOPS IN N OUT!!!!!!! The steak burgers are delicious! and the fries with the Freddy's sauce is divine. I wish California had a Freddy's!! You have to try their frozen custard if you ever come in! Dang it now I'm getting hungry.."}
{"text":"i've been coming here for years, since it opened....it is consistently excellent....i do think they have improved their burgers since it opened...bigger & more substantial now than in the past...their root beer float--vanilla custard and root beer is as good as it gets...custard beats ice cream....good fries, but i really prefer the onion rings...and the hot dogs are a nice change someimtes, when i'm not quite so hungry...when i get iced tea, i like that there are always lots of fresh lemon slices avail...also like that it is real brewed tea...not from a mix...

i still like in 'n out burger....but freddy's is more convenient....."}
{"text":"Just went to this Freddy's and not the best service. I pulled up to the window after they took my money they literally shoved the bag of food in my hand and slammed the window shut. I was trying to ask to add more sauce and she ignored me and shut the window. SO RUDE. Not acceptable Freddy's"}
{"text":"It was purely by accident that i found this place! Especially the fact it is a mile from home! I had never heard of the chain but decided to try it!  I like this place tons more than their local competition!!!  The burgers, fry sauce and frozen yogurts are perfect!!!! Thank you for my new addiction!"}
{"text":"My husband really enjoyed the steak sandwich.  I had chicken tenders and some of his fries.  It was pretty tastey. Quick service and hot food.  I think we will stop in again if we are in the mood for fast food."}
{"text":"Freddy's burgers and fries hit the spot.  Always.  The concept and food is very similar to Steak n Shake - but I think the burgers might be better here!  

In a twist of burger irony, we tried to eat at In-N-Out burger on Easter Sunday night  around 6pm, but they were closed. So we headed for Freddy's because burgers and fries were calling our name.  The California burger has a sauce similar to thousand island dressing - which is my favorite burger.  The fries are shoestring style.  

If you don't want too many fries, then share a plate.  Each burger comes with a gazillion fries - you can easily save money by sharing one order. The kids meals also come with a gazillion fries, so skip the kids meal and just order a  solo burger and share your fries with the kiddos!  

For my 3-year old and myself, we walked out feeling very full for a mere $12.  Freddy's is a very family friendly place.  The staff is always super nice!"}
{"text":"i have ate at freddys many times and it is usually good..the food was great today,we got there when they just opened the door at 10:30..the floors were dirty and we were the first ones in and the lady taking our order was a little cranky especially when we took more than a second to decide..then she had to correct me on my verbage on the menu..i made the mistake and called it a meal( meaning with fries and drink) i was sternly corrected and told it was a #3...lol forgive my ignorance!!! probably wont be back for a while..foods is good but not good enough to put up with attitude from staff!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep beating my head against a wall trying the frozen custard joints in town.  They all taste like Dairy Queen and get too sweet after the first few bites.  Anyhow, I made a coffee/brownie concrete and I thought it wasn't too bad, although my friends didn't like the shake and sundae they had ordered.  I guess it was too sweet, but I still made it through it."}
{"text":"Maybe for some its good. I found a single burger to be paper thin, over salted, but otherwise tasty in its own right. Not my thing though."}
{"text":"Had a regular cheeseburger deluxe. Loved the steak burger. Had I known it was so thin I would have opted for a double. The tiny minuscule fries were cute. They came with their signature sauce which reminded me of oh....Artic Circle fry sauce. Family environment."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today.. Have to say it was amazing... The food and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Freddy's and we ordered a steakburger and fries. The shoestring fries were good tasting and crisp. The burger is lower fat, I think and pressed very flat, which takes away the juice which would add flavor. It also lacked proper seasoning. I like that we had it served on grilled rye bread and I had swiss cheese and sauteed onion on it which was flavorful. I would have liked it better if it had lettuce and tomato, but the only burger that I saw afterwards with that combo on was the California burger.
I finished with a Mini Turtle Sundae which was a very satisfying helping of ice cream, caramel, hot fudge, half pecans, whip cream, and a cherry on top. There was another sundae which looked great which had pineapple and coconut. The staff were very friendly, but didn't keep all of the tables cleaned often enough. This restaurant is a national chain, but doesn't have nutritional data online nor was it available when I asked for it at the store. Freddy's should consider making that information available."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. Never had the custard because we are usually pretty full with the food itself. Booths are fairly large and could probably fir between 6 and 8 people, depending on size. Dislike how parents always let their kids stand in front of the soda machine tasting every soda (I know that's not the establishment's fault and it does not affect their rating)."}
{"text":"This place was very good!  It reminded me of steak and shakes which I frequented while I lived in Texas!  Their burgers were good and I loved the turtle frozen custard! I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! I surprised my husband and myself by choosing Freddy's for my birthday dinner. Normally I would pick something a little fancier but it was very late and I was very hungry. I am glad those two factors alone led us to Freddy's. It is a fun restaurant with a southern-50's charm. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. I loved the single patty steak burger with extra pickles. Get it California style to ensure you get tomato and lettuce! 

Normally I don't care for thin-sliced fries, or shoe string fries, but these ones were great. They have seasoning to add to the fries as well as sauce. 

It is a fun place for adults and kids!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream for a drive through and the burgers are pretty good too. Love the fries, just eat them while they're still hot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and cheerful staff! I have only gotten a drive thru order but it was perfect! Definitely will be back MANY more times!"}
{"text":"Nice old school burger and shake place.  The burgers are juicy and they taste even better with Freddy's special sauce on them.  The ice cream is delicious as well.  It would be nice if they also offered thicker fries but I get that thin fries are basically part of their signature  meal.  Their prices  are a bit high but it's still fun to go every now and then when you are in a  \"diet be damned, I'm eating something tasty!\" mood. Oh, and props to the employees for always being cheerful and helpful."}
{"text":"during my visit the gentleman on grill made my patty very flat, and dry. when i brought this up to the manager Paul he did nothing and when the manager Micayla came up she fixed the problem in a speddy manner. during the time i was forced to go staving and cold becuase the lobby is like -13 degress c
 overall: food 5/10 spicy thang
staff 7.3/10 spicy thang

will happly come again"}
{"text":"I'll have to be in agreement with most of the other reviews posted here about Freddy's. Middling, nothing truly outstanding. They are definitely taking a page direct from the Steak N Shake enterprise, almost a direct clone.

We had lunch there on Saturday morning. As with practically any restaurant in their Concord Mills general location, the store was relatively busy. The counter service as we ordered and picked up our selections was good. The dining area was spacious and clean, with a faux 1940s decor.

We both had the #5 special, a double patty-melt with fries and drink. Our food was cooked to order and delivered in a very reasonable amount of time.

Both in agreement, the sandwich was good. However, to call it a double is a misnomer. As others have mentioned, these patties are hammered so thin that a double may possibly equal 1 normal burger patty. I'm sure the crispness of the thin patty edges is a signature to Freddy's.

The fries are very very thin, almost reminding one of fresh cut potato sticks (like the out of the can type). They were good, but just not very filling.

When our meal was finished, we decided to try some of their signature frozen custard. As the line at the counter was very long now, we decided to just go through the empty drive thru to order. This was where our visit went slightly awry. 

It took four attempts to order two frozen custard cones, even with very clear explanations of each being given. And on pick up, one was still wrong.

Will I return to Freddy's? Yes, for at least for one more visit. I noted while there a Chicago Dog listed on the menu, and with a Vienna Beef wiener advertised. As these are not easy to find in the Charlotte area, I do want to try one.

Concluding: 
Freddy's is OK visit, but one that I would not necessarily go out of my way to select. Perhaps others will be more impressed. This location is in too competitive of a market to be uninspiring. Good luck!"}
{"text":"NOTHING SPECIAL about this place..their fries are stringy..burgers are small and flavorless..I brought my kids and they wouldnt eat..I hate Mc donalds and burger king but I would have rather eaten there..and my bill was $30 bucks!NEVER AGAIN!.In & out is way better and cheaper..sorry Freddys try again..your burgers are over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"Went here because I saw as I go to work. So I took the family after church Sunday (10/26). Never had a steak burger. Was not greasey, fries were cut small, and had a hot dog with mustard, onions and chili. Loved all of it! My wife is Asian and she said she liked the place because the burgers are not greasy and loved the fries also. Plus they have fry sauce...Custard was great also. Try it you will like."}
{"text":"Excellent service, tasty steak burgers and great concretes. They are more than happy to make your order perfect! Try them out!"}
{"text":"I would drive across town for the french fries and turtle sundae alone.  Manager is extremely friendly and helpful.  I just witnessed him personally bring a food order to an elderly woman at her table.  His momma brought him up right!!"}
{"text":"The burger and dog combo is a winner. I'm not usually a fry guy but I definitely get them here. I am never disappointed at Freddy's!"}
{"text":"I been here a few times and although I love there pattie melts they can never get the order correct. The patties have either WAY too much salt on them or there leaving and item out.. It's disappointing. My recent visit actually was last night to Freddy's  I received crappy customer service and a manager ( I'm assuming he was a manager because his shirt was different then the other workers, more of a dressy shirt and with a collar) was being extremely disrespectful towards 2 of his employees. Needless to say I won't be back to visit after that."}
{"text":"Fresh stuff always taste best and the nice thing is even on Weight Watchers you can get a burger loaded with veggies, no sauce and cheese that tastes like you ate a burger! Fries and onion rings are awesome. The only con's in the kid's at the drive through, they barely allow you to get through your order before interrupting you when your telling them what you want. I can get past it, if they were a little more patient I would give it five stars. Food is five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"We just moved to surprise and found this place. The stake burgers are good but we now go for the frozen custard. The mixers and all. We usually stop by at least once a week for family night. 
If you get a chance stop by."}
{"text":"First try and I took the cashier's recommendation, the #6 and it was fresh and tasty. It is a little on the expensive side and the meal will sit with you a while, but it is a nice alternative to the big fast food burger joints."}
{"text":"This Freddys is always good. Friendly quick service and they always keep the place clean. Burgers are great. What they call California Style is your standard burger to most people. Just try Freddy's, you will like it."}
{"text":"After working down the street from Freddy's for a year and half and wanting to go, I finally went with a coworker who raved about the place.

I ordered the # 1 combo, burger, drink and fries. The meal was just under $7.

The burger is fresh and very good and enjoyed my burger. I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger, but it's in the upper echelon especially in the Phoenix Area.. 

One thing that stands out is the pickles that are served on the burger. I've never had  long sliced pickles on a burger, usually just pickle chips. I wish ketchup came on the burger, but you can add this yourself.

Fries were good, could have used a little more than the small scoop I received. 
 
I will definitely go back and maybe next time opt for a custard or sweet treat."}
{"text":"I really loved it, I prefer a thin hamburger to a giant meat puck. The only thing that was not good is that they forgot my fries. I just ate my boyfriend's instead.  However, for the coast of a combo it's pretty pricey to miss out on them."}
{"text":"I thought this place would blow Culver's outta the water...but eh it's pretty much the same. I hit the drive thru & ordered the following: #1 w/onion rings & a Dr. P, another #1 but make it a single & no onions w/fries & a Dr. P & a regular sized concrete with chocolate frozen custard, cookie dough & marshmallow. They messed up & gave us 2 fries, I need to always remember to check the bag! But hubby wasn't too disappointed, the fries were really good. The burgers were good too but our food was barely warm, ugh. The frozen custard was bomb! But I think Culver's burgers & frozen custard are just as good (they do beat them in the fries category though), plus they are way closer to us, so I will just stick w/them when we're in the mood for that kind of stuff!"}
{"text":"Pretty freaking good, the only reason it is not a full 5 stars is because it was a little messy inside due to how busy it is. Other than that it is fantastic."}
{"text":"We love the fry sauce here !! the fries are super skinny but the food is good and the atmosphere is fun -you can totally picture a 50s restaurant when you go here and enjoy a meal :)"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! and Yummy!  The patti-melt was perfection, the shoe string fries will have me coming back for more especially beacuse of the Freddy's French Frie Sauce- did I say Yummy yet?  Do not leave without getting a frozen custard, even if you are full, Look out ice cream I may never come back!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms were clean, resturant was clean and the staff was so patient and poliet! And Avery (I think he was the manager) was just the BOMB, fun guys and gals there. So glad I stopped!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, super friendly staff, really good burgers, awesome custard. Good place for laid back family dining."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever eaten. And I've eaten quite a few. Every aspect of the meal was perfect to the maximum. Ignore the bad reviews, they are probably just bitter over something. You will not regret eating here."}
{"text":"I love Freddy's but this location has terrible service! I've been there multiple times and everytime there is something wrong with my order or service is slow. The last time I went, some pecans inexplicably found their way into my oreo skake! What if I had been allergic!!! Luckily, I'm not however it was extremely irritating to get excited thinking I got a chunk of oreo only to find out it was a pecan! Not cool bro!"}
{"text":"I LOVE in-n-out, and maybe it's because I'm partial to it since I grew up with it and have loved it since I was a kid. But as much as I hate to admit it.. I think Freddy's is better (but shhh I secretly don't want to admit it). I don't know why people compare In-N-Out to the likes of shake shack, five guys, etc. I think those are unfair comparisons because In-N-Out is much cheaper than those places. However, I truly believe that Freddy's is the best direct comparison because of the price point of the burgers and the staff is just as friendly.

As for food, I usually get the California style single steakburger with grilled onions and fries or upgrade to onion rings for a little bit more. The burger is as good as in-n-out or better, but the fries are hands down better! The onion rings are really good too (and that's not something In-N-Out has)!

Also, if you have room or want to share dessert with someone, the concretes are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Was brought with the entire family to this location, and it was a pleasant surprise.  The food is great, patties are delicous, and the custard options are fun.

The staff was very courteous and said nothing when I did something quite inappropriate at the time.  I am sorry to say I passed gas repeatedly in their establishment.  I could tell that one of the employees could smell a more serious one by the look on her face (it was silent but violent and it was just the two of us standing near the soda machine.) I thought that the amazing smell of the food would win out, but somehow it didn't.  It surprised me then, and it still does.  The way the worker handled it has made this a lot easier for me.

This employee stayed there in the offensive conditions I'd just created, and somehow managed to complete her tasks without bringing further attention to what I'd done.  She handled the experience very professionally, and even though I was nervous I was also really impressed.  I would have thanked her and told her manager that she was a good employee, but I didn't want to bring shame to myself and my family.  I didn't even see the name on her tag, just got my refill and sort of scurried off in what I thought was considerate respect.  Now I see that it was shameful, running from my responsibilities like that.  If I could go back and apologize,  I would. I guess I could, but I know that I won't.   I'm just typing it here.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for what I did to you. 

Thank you for your professional discretion and patience, mystery employee.  Would dine here again."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have been a big fan of Freddy's for years (frequent the Mattoon location) and I was excited to have one in Champaign.  I have been to the Champaign location twice now and both have been awful experiences. This store is brand new but it was extremely dirty. Tops of tables had not been cleared, the backs of the booths were dirty, the counter was dirty. There were THREE girls standing behind the counter just talking to each other when there was clearly some maintenance that needed to be addressed. The lady taking our order got it wrong after I corrected her multiple times. She was very rude. The food was sub-par. I only got a handle full of fries, when every other Freddy's you get a plethora.  The burger was hard. I gave it two chances, I don't think I will be going back. Freddy's really needs evaluate the staffing."}
{"text":"Had driven past this restaurant for a while and decided to give it a try a few weeks ago.

Had a burger, fries and a soda and was pleasantly surprised.

It's a pretty typical burger joint but the meat was generous, cooked just right -- and everything was tasty.

Have been back a few times already and the people are friendly...and the last time I was there the manager gave me a some frozen yogurt to try.

Man I was already full and I should NOT have said yes to that -- but I shared it around and we all agreed it was pretty good on a hot day.

Anywho -- when I'm in the mood for a burger it'll be nice to have another good place to go."}
{"text":"One of the best burger stands in Las Vegas. Good service, food and atmosphere. Looking to stop in sometime soon."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite!   Freddie's Steakburger and Custard is hands down the best hamburger to hit Surprise az yet!   We have one suggestion, the oil needs to be kept hot for the fries otherwise they get to greasy!   That's why I give them 4 stars as about half the time we eat their the fries are good and the other times they are soaked in greased, which means that the temp of the oil isn't hot enough."}
{"text":"This place is The Bomb! The Burgers taste fresh. Unlike all the other joints. Hope they bring one to the Centennial Hills area."}
{"text":"Pretty much a Steak n Shake clone.  The burgers have a little different flavor, they're leaner, less greasy, maybe a tad dry, without the gristle you sometimes find in a Steak n Shake burger.  Fries are a little drier too.  Didn't try the custard.  You can dine in without tipping as there is no table service."}
{"text":"The first time I went here they messed up everything. I called them and the Manager told me to come back in. We got free food and Whatever else we wanted off the menu. This Place has great customer service."}
{"text":"I did not like the food here i think its overpriced for the veggie burger you get cause there shore isnt any meat on it . Our burger patties was so thin  it looked like the crust of the burger that sticks to the pan after you flip it like they scraped it off and slapped it on a bun. My five year old boy was still hungry after eating it. Although i am impressed by their custard! It is the best thing they got going!"}
{"text":"I love this place the burgers are great I love the custard the PBC&B is the concrete I get most often that is vanilla with peanut butter cup and banana Hawaiian Delight is also excellent also funnel cakes that last visit I did I had the nutter butter custard cookie sandwich loved it only thing I do not care for are the shoe string fries I like bigger fries so I always get the onion rings instead over all I recommend this place"}
{"text":"You can tell the food is good when there's always a crowd! They have great chili dogs that come on Texas toast. I was skeptical at first being the hard core Chicagoan I am.( hot dogs are a big deal to me!) that skepticism melted away with the yummy toasty goodness that accompanied that first bite. They've made a mistake or 2 in the drive thru so always double check. Even with the mistakes they're very good at making sure customers leave happy.  I recently tried their hatch chili burger and it doesn't disappoint on flavor. They dice the chili peppers and mix them with grilled onions so it's an even distribution unlike Carl's Jr.'s whole seeded pepper."}
{"text":"Discovered Freddy's while waiting for my wife to get off work.  Their steak burgers are delicious!  I have never had burgers done the way they do it here. And their string fries are perfectly done, paired with their own fry sauce!  Freddy's is my favorite burger place from now on!"}
{"text":"Really good! My family decided to grab a burger and it was really good. The fries are so yummy with the fry sauce. Great customer service from all the staff. Dining are is kept up really well. We will he back real soon. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"My one and ONLY regret about moving from this side of town is that there isn't a Freddy's close to me anymore. I am so obsessed with the BBQ Bacon cheese burger that I will make the drive from centennial to come down here and grub. I have to have this burger. I mean even the fry sauce is amazing. Everything here is amazing. And the employees are so sweet! Every time I'm here it's a really good experience."}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember from Kansas. The burgers are delicious and so is the custard"}
{"text":"Great customer service, poor food quality. I stopped in for lunch because I heard that the milk shakes were great. Liars! My shake taste like warmed melted ice cream, frys were cold, and burgers way to salty. So disappointed about my milk shake, Sonic here I come."}
{"text":"Went to Freddy's this hot Sunday afternoon for a custard - JUST A CUSTARD! Ordered said custard and was informed where I could pick up custard when my number was called. I waited, then took a bathroom break, then waited some more in sight of the grill area, while watching and hearing other orders being delivered. Then I just happened to glance back to the area where the server took my order and saw that she was just beginning to scoop chocolate custard into a bowl. (I thought that must be my order.) Then I saw server top the custard with the toppings and knew it was in fact my order. Server's eyes and mine met, and she started walking toward me, with my sundae. She then apologized for the wait. By that time it had been 10 - 15 minutes - on a not busy at all afternoon. I don't know what caused the delay (she forgot about my order?) and I ate my sundae. It was pretty good but when I was almost finished I looked back up at the order board where pictures of sundaes were displayed. There I noticed that the sundaes displayed were topped with whipped cream and a cherry. (Mine was not!) I happen to actually like those artificially flavored cherries and whipped cream but by that time I was on my way out the door. Service was definitely not a \"10\" but the sundae was good (would have been even better with the whipped cream and cherry!)."}
{"text":"Don't ask me why or how, but their Pepsi tastes different and better than any other place I've ever been to. Their fries are thin unlike typical fast food places and their hot dogs have kind of crispy skin texture that I've never had before. If you're ever in the mood for a hot dog and soda, this is your place."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Very fast service and the food was great. Ordered the Double-Steak Cheeseburger California Style, the sauce used on it was delicious, served with Shoestring Fries, yummy. For desert ordered double cone chocolate custard, scrumptious. Grandson had the Dirt and Worms, he loved it.A great family restaurant, atmosphere great!"}
{"text":"We love Freddy's.  Their shakes are awesome.  We take the family here often.  Their burgers are good too."}
{"text":"Why have I never heard of this place? Definitely the best fast food burger in town! It is a steakburger,  not just hamburger, and you can taste the difference. The super skinny fries were perfect! Other places with fries this skinny are too oily, but not here.  The chocolate custard was very chocolaty,  and a single scoop more than enough. The staff seems to really enjoy working here also. Great prices, great food, great environment! We need more Freddy's in town."}
{"text":"What an amazing blessing!!!!!  After ball practice we took the kids up for dinner.  We ordered our meals (two adults and two kids) and it was on the house!!!!  The cashier said, \"This is your lucky day.  Its on us.  We appreciate your business and thank you.\"  We were so surprised and really didn't get why.  How terrible that good customer service is so shocking!  But it was.  What a great thing!  The managers were beyond great, the staff was awesome, the food was good, and its so amazing when customer service is a valued part of business.  Especially in this day and age.  It made our night and its a great feeling to know there are still good managers teaching their staff good values.  Thank you Freddy's!!  We will be customers for life!"}
{"text":"The hours posted on the door for today are 9am to 10.pm yet we get there at 920 and cashier proceeds to tell me we can order to go because the restaurant is all clean and ready to close. He made a face when we entered and he had an attitude. Bad judgement on the hiring managers part. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to come here almost everyday. Now a bunch of dirty teens work at night laughing and pushing eachother around in the back. Fries were soggy and cold and were covered in sticky red stuff. This stucky red stuff also on my drink. I was so discussed I wanted to puke. Threw it all out and will NEVER be coming back. You could not pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"In the world of burgers, Freddy's is pretty great. Their patties are on the thin side and they like the salt pretty heavy. (minus one star for that.) But don't get me wrong; the damn things are tasty. And for the low-carb or Gluten Free crowd they happily lettuce wrap.  The frozen custard is absolutely devilish. If you ever feel like torturing someone ... let them have a little taste and then eat the rest in front of them. Gitmo tactics wouldn't hold a candle to that. The staff always seems pleasant and energetic, which would lead me to believe they might treat them well. I've never had a bad meal here and never been disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Freddy's is the type of place you want to drive out of the way to go eat! I love the burgers and the shoestring Fry's are in my top 3 fav to eat! 

This is a must go restaurant! If you think Smashburger is good then go get a real burger at Freddy's and experience a burger worth talking about and savoring! 

The custard, although sounds kind of weird to eat, is awesome! Just try any one of the flavors and you will see why this place gets a 5 star rating from me!"}
{"text":"If I could a 0 star rating I would.... The girl working in the window needs to find a job she actually enjoys. You can tell she hates her job... She's aggressive & not pleasant. Ripping the money out of my hands & tossing the change back. Literally couldn't get the order right. Just so simple. Let's just say there was NOTHING on my burger. I specifically asked for lettuce, tomato and onion. BUT NOTHING! Go to 5 guys instead. WAY better quality and you are taken care of by people who actually enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this Freddy's opening at warm springs because I know it was good. I was shocked when I got my food... Thin steak patties and were really salty, buns are squished and the fries were limpy and is not hot. The custard ice cream tasted fine but was overfilled; spills everywhere. The one on Eastern is so much better. Hope they can do a better job and keep up to their standards. I cant believe I paid $34 that the food looks like dog food."}
{"text":"This place has the best burger I have ever eaten. The burgers are always fresh here. They have a very nice inside too. The decor is pretty great."}
{"text":"This place deserves some credit. At first I thought the price was a little high but the mountain of food made up for it. Great crispy fries and the steak burger wasn't half bad, it actually tasted like steak. Didn't get a chance to try the sweets but my sons hotdog was great as we're my wife chili cheese fries. The cherry on top for me was having Code red as a selection in the fountain drinks. Freddy's = The best fast food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've only had the single cheeseburger and fries here but they're amazing. I like the thin patty with crispy edges. If you don't like the reg burgers at other places that have hard and chewy fat pieces, this is the burger you should try instead. The fries are good only if you like shoestring fries and the fry sauce really makes the fries better. If you live further than 10-15 min away I suggest eating there bc it starts to get soggy after a while but still well worth the purchase. I have yet to try any deserts."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this location on Friday night cruise in.
I like the California double, but most of all love the custard waffle cone. It's a nice sweet change from the norm of ice cream. Give Freddy's a try!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and was super impressed!! Love everything! Even the cats that chill outside."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Person on speaker wasn't rude but also not friendly. Waited a long time at the window. Two staff members were standing talking & although I realize they weren't \"cooks\" it didn't help my patience. Got home & everything smelled & looked delicious. Chicken strips were hot and decent sized. Double steak burger had great flavor. Buttered buns! Hot dog was decent size & taste great. Fries were thin cut & a lil salty. Very impressed with their fry dip made of mayo & ketchup & pickle juice."}
{"text":"Just had a hamburger at Freddy's. The pickle was thicker than the patty!
Yelp wants a longer comment. Have nothing else to add."}
{"text":"Comparing their quality of customer service and food to most other fast food joints is like comparing the Ritz Carlton to Motel 6. Seriously. Not to mention it's virtually impossible to go anywhere else that offers a military discount these days. I got the chicken sandwich combo which was very tasty. It filled me up to the point I was too full to try that thing called a turtle, but gosh it looked so tasty! Looking forward to coming back and trying it another day."}
{"text":"Freddy's is the top choice burger joint. I love the variety and the sundaes are killer yummmm.. The chili fries are delish and the fry sauce mmmmm mm m.. The hot dogs are theee best. This is one place definitely worth your while and the price of a meal isn't that bad compared to getting great quality food. The staff is friendly and Craig is awesome!"}
{"text":"I came in just now and ordered two orders of three piece chicken meals through the drive-through. I got home and open the bag and there was a burger and fries. I just paid $16 for a burger and fries rather than my 2 orders of a chicken. Just what I needed after a long day at work! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Freddy's is what Steak n' Shake aspires to be.  The burgers are better and the fries are perfectly cooked.  Bonus points for ease of access as opposed to Steak n' Shake(inside South Point Hotel)."}
{"text":"Customer service is back!  This place is awesome. Good food, friendly and courteous staff, clean restaurant. 

The young men at the counter were very helpful, friendly, and answered questions I had about some menu items.

During the meal, an employee went from table to table asking customers if they needed anything. Another was wiping tables and straightening chairs. The employees here really do care about the customer, and the restaurant.

The burger was great....they couldn't have done it better. Shoestring fries aren't my favorite, but they were prepared very well. Their fry sauce is to die for!

Think I'm about to become a regular there."}
{"text":"First time here!  Great food. Atmosphere and employees. Definitely coming back. The double steakhouse California style with a chocolate waffle cone for dessert."}
{"text":"Wanted so badly for this to be good.  Prices....Not bad .  Atmosphere....What you would expect.  Beyond that it was a Fail!  Literally could not find a clean table in the place.  Floor was slippery of grease and food .  Fortunately my wife keeps wipes with her , because we had to clean our own table and seats.   \"Double burgers\" is a bit misleading.  The burger patties are so thin, that 2 together barely make One.  Flavor was  bland...Not much going on to write home about. We order drinks and pay for them, only to approach a drink machine with none of the Sodas available.  Fries are extremely reminiscent of Potatoe Sticks (not a good thing).  As we ate our disappointing meal, we spoke of how we wanted to enjoy , so.....as a last shot we went for the Freddy's Frozen Custard.  I ordered a \"Turtle\"....The response....\"Sorry, we are all out of vanilla custard\".

Sorry....Don't think we will be back.  Way too many places to go around the Mills."}
{"text":"Freddy's is near our home-we eat there about 1-2 times a month. The food is consistant.  The employees are friendly.  The steakburgers are paper thin. The chili and chili dogs are really not that good in my opinion.  Pattymelts are decent.  Sundaes are really good!"}
{"text":"I just happened to be in the area and decided to try Freddy's for lunch. I had high hopes for this place, I really did. The aroma in the parking lot was enticing. The restaurant itself is clean and neat. I ordered the patty melt and my daughter had the kid's burger. I thought the burgers themselves were great. The fries looked delicious,. I was sorely disappointed. The sheer amount of salt used on these fries rendered them inedible. My little girl is a french fry fanatic and barely touched hers. They were almost painful to eat. I was approached by a server and asked if I would like to try the fry salt. Um, no. I feel like I'm already dipping chunks of a salt lick in ketchup. The concretes and other goodies looked yummy, maybe next time we'll just go for treats and not lunch. The staff seemed very friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at Freddy's.  I don't eat alot of burgers or fries anymore because I love to cook.  I stopped in to try their burgers and fries to hold me over til dinner.  I loved the fries by themselves but they have an incredible fry sauce that must be tried to be believed.. .  It matches their seasoned fries so well...  And the burger.   I got the original double.  It comes with onions sandwich sliced pickles (long) and mustard.  Sooooo good, fresh and the meat was of obvious quality.  I'm impressed...."}
{"text":"Serious problem with accuracy of orders, although the staff is very amiable and the burgers are good. CHECK your sandwiches if you are ordering to-go or drive-thru! Just about half the time (18 orders total), my order has been wrong. Hard to believe, given that I always get one plain burger as a treat for my dogs. Today sadly was the last straw, as the plain burger wasn't plain, and mine included dairy, to which I'm allergic. Back to Red Robin for takeaway!"}
{"text":"I thought that this place was pretty good. The store was very clean and the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Everything came out really fast as well. I really liked the milkshake, you could make it however you wanted which was nice. The fries were also good. The burger was good, I didn't really care for how thin the patties were. It was good once but I don't think I'll come here again, stick with smashburger or in and out."}
{"text":"OK, my fist five star review!  What can I say, I liked it a lot.  Any time I can feed the two of us for a 10 spot or so, well, need I say more?  Freddy's is, \"The Now!!! !\".   Tasty Too!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I'm not a big fan of the small frys but that won't stop me from coming back to try the hot dog."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove past Freddy's yesterday, not really realizing it was there and open. There seemed to be a pretty decent amount of people coming and going, and I decided I would check it out the first chance I got. That first chance was earlier this afternoon, as I needed to get some lunch.

I wanted to try a few items, so I ordered a singe hamburger, a Chicago hot dog and fries.

Service: The guy taking my order and working the register was friendly and efficient. It was kind of difficult to hear him over the noise of the restaurant, though. Other workers came to my table to ask if everything was okay and to take away a tray and some garbage.

Atmosphere: The restaurant was crowded and loud. It seemed like a good place to go if you were going with kids.

Hamburger: Similar to Steak 'n Shake: a steakburger that was smashed thin and flat. I found it to be kind of tasteless. It wasn't bad, but just seemed to be lacking flavor.

Fries: Again, similar to Steak 'n Shake. They were thin and crispy and good. I especially enjoyed dipping them in the jalapeno Freddy's sauce that was available.

Chicago Dog: A big disappointment. The bun was too big for the thin hot dog and the fixings just didn't seem to blend well. It didn't have the steamed poppyseed bun of a Chicago dog, there were no sport peppers, not enough tomatoes and too many onions.

Verdict: It was okay. I'd be willing to give it another try, especially since the frozen custard selections look very enticing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. From the environment to the location. Food and the employees. It's always a great time here at Freddy's. Definitely a must place to eat at."}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot when on the west side. I had the California style burger and it was really really good. The seasoning on the patty is perfect and I like that the buns are buttered and toasted. The fries were also really good and loved the fry sauce they have to dip them in. Had an oreo chocolate ice cream sandwich to top off the meal and it was the perfect ending. Restaurant was clean, reasonably priced and the service was quick and friendly. Fingers crossed they open a Scottsdale location in the future."}
{"text":"Order two of the single combos.  The steak burgers come with mustard, pickle and onion on a plain toasted bun.  The burgers are smashed flat like we would do at home, a little crispy at the edges, moist but not greasy, made to order and piping hot.  The shoestring fries are worth a trip back.  Hot, crispy and I could eat a basket of these alone.  Our order came to just over eleven dollars for the combos and that includes medium refillable drinks.

Had to try the custard, so ordered the turtle sundae.  The small cup looked a little well, small, at the counter but is very adequate.  The turtle comes with caramel, pecans, hot fudge and the richest creamiest custard I've had.  

Definitely worth a trip back.  The burgers are good, not great but good.  The custard is outstanding.  Four stars."}
{"text":"Great food, quick and friendly service. Low prices but not low quality.
The turtle sundaes are fabulous!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was a bit skeptical about this place, mostly  because I had never heard people talk about it the way they do about in n out, but wow.. am I glad I chose to eat here tonight instead of chipotle LOL. I decided to try something new and it's safe to say Im obsessed with this place!!! The flavor of their burgers are indescribable, way better than any other burger joint in Vegas imo. LOVE IT !!! Definitely coming back next weekend YUM!!"}
{"text":"Another burger joint! Not so fast!
Unlike some of the other places that have been popping up that have really limited seating and getting served takes 30 minutes, this place is a dream. Huge seating area, multiple drink stations and a killer menu. Fries and onion rings are outrageous.
Best sandwich in my humble opinion is the Patty Melt - da bomb.
Gives you an excuse to either go to the mall or an excuse to leave the mall!! HAHAHAHA
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was very clean inside. I'm a mom so I inspect mostly everything. As we walked in, I explained to the cashier that it was our first time and to please give me time to look at the menu. He was so nice to explain everything to us. I have 2 young kids are they are pretty picky eaters. My son had no problems finding something to eat. My daughter, I've never seen her eat with such gusto. It was nice to have a nice family meal together. The burgers themselves are a different story. I really enjoyed the fact that the meat was skinny. It made feeding the kids easy. The taste was good. A bit on the messy side, but in my opinion, that makes a better burger. The shakes, I says have one to start with and a custard to end!"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because as far as fast food goes, it's good. However, they employ kids and people who do not take the job seriously and do not pay attention. As a result of goofing off in the kitchen, they did not put a bun on my burger. I don't know if it was an accident or if it was intentional as a joke because who forgets to put a BUN on a burger? I'm hoping it was an accident because it's seriously not good if there's a bunch of kids working in the kitchen who don't take the job or customer service seriously."}
{"text":"Great place...good food and friendly staff. We stopped in one day, my daughter just had a birthday and asked if they would sing to her. They said by policy they do not do this. Well, while we were eating out came 5 or 6 staff members and they sang happy birthday to her with a free birthday custard!!! Needless to say she was very happy!!! 
GREAT job to Freddy's!!"}
{"text":"Food here is not bad but the wait is atrocious. Literally in drive through for fifteen minutes now.  Pretty sure this place is considered a fast food place. Key word is fast"}
{"text":"Steakburgers are AWESOME.  Love this place!!  the FRIES are PHENOMINAL!!!!!!!!!   FIVE GUYS BURGERS???????  Please!!!  Freddy's tops five guys."}
{"text":"The customer \"service\" here is awful. They hire incompetent people to take your order. You repeat it three times to make sure they have it correct, yet they enter it wrong. Once you get home you discover you have the wrong food, and it is so gross to you that it goes in the trash. You try to call over and over to get your issue dealt with and Freddy's can't even be bothered to answer the phone, they just have on an answering machine. For what they charge ($20 for one kid and one adult!) they can answer the phone."}
{"text":"Super delicious frozen custard sundaes!

The (Hawaiian Delight) frozen custard sundae was so good, my husband and I came back the following day and brought along my in-laws along to try it!

I did knock a star off for the patty melt and chili cheese fries that I had tried on our first visit which I thought were just \"meh-okay tasting,\" but like I said the frozen custard is so good it didn't stop us from coming back. 

Our kids enjoyed the Dirt 'N Worms sundaes (vanilla custard, Oreo crumbles, gummy worms, whipped cream and a cherry) and Chocolate Shakes. 

The Hawaiian Delight sundae consisted of yummy vanilla custard, pineapple, strawberry, coconut, macadamia nuts, whipped cream and a cherry. I also tried the PBC & B sundae (vanilla custard, Reese's peanut butter cup pieces, bananas, whipped cream and a cherry) which was tasty as well but not as great as the Hawaiian Delight."}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for. Great burger, lovely skinny fries. We were greeted by a friendly young lady and the service was fast. 
I loved the crispy edges on the burger"}
{"text":"Good Burger. Bad fries. Better price. My one and only complaint is the fries suck. They're like hash browns that grew up. Not at all a good compliment to an otherwise great tasting medley of meat and cheese. I would suggest that you convert the fries to chilli fries. The price is great, fries aside, so I don't feel cheated by the complete lack of effort in the fry department."}
{"text":"The custard is very good but that's the only thing that I would go back for. I've been there 3 times and the food is good but it always seems that I'm short on something. I had an order of fried pickles and I only got 10 small pieces and my order is fries was only half full and don't even try to ask for a onions or tomatoes removed from a sandwich, it'll get messed up. 
I'm only giving it 3 stars because of how great the custard has been."}
{"text":"Desserts are amazing here! I've tried the one that had gummy bears and a Hawaiian ice cream sundae. Both were delicious. I've tried there food I just didn't like the string fries."}
{"text":"Fries were great- very crispy. Fry sauce not much, but if you are a fan of mayo and ketchup you might like it. Custard is top notch! The burger tasted exactly like Steak n'Shake- which is not a problem, I love that place. If you are looking for a thick burger, this is not the place. These are thin steak burgers so maybe get a double. All in all, very clean and good customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The best hamburgers I have ever had. I hate that there isn't one closer to where we live, Scottsdale. But whenever we are on this side of town, we always come here. :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this location of freddy's and I couldn't have been more pleased. I was picking up lunch for the entire office and they were so helpful and separated each order and checked to make sure everything was right. I have never been so pleased with my service. Alexis was incredibly helpful. As well as Craig!! They even offered to help carry my order to my car!!! :)"}
{"text":"If you like steak burgers and actually know what that is 
Don't hesitate.   Freddy's is a better version of Steak & Shake 

The Chili Fries are on point and the Burger is everything 
A Steak Burger is suppose to be 
But the Star of the show is The Turtle Shake 
Even if you just order Shake its worth the trip 

Customer Service is awesome 
Good alternative to In & Out
K.I.S.S."}
{"text":"The burgers were decent, I still prefer this over McDonald's, Wendy's, or burger King. But however I like In N Out better. The Fries tasted okay by them selves but with their seasoning and Freddy's Fry Sauce they were really good! The custard was pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"The best burgers and fries anywhere. And don't forget to try the Freddy's fries dipping sauce. And the staff are friendly and take good care of you. Excellent management. I have been going there once a week since they opened."}
{"text":"First visit: service was nice and fast, quick sit down, close in an area that is booming, and don't forget delicious. Yummo!"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOSH. I'm from San Francisco so we don't have anything like Freddy's anywhere and I LOVE frozen custard. My husband and I drove by on our way to the Nike Factory and I freaked out a little bit cause well, custard. After shopping, we walked in and ordered one vanilla frozen custard and fries, not knowing the amazingness that is Freddy's. I kid you not, my first bite into the custard and my eyes lit up. I immediately gave my husband a spoonful for him to try, same reaction. Long story short, he bought another custard and ended up giving it to me cause I loved it so much. also. Shoestring fries are my absolute favorite soo there's that too. The staff are so friendly and helpful, it's super clean, and I LOVE the vibe of the dining room. 
I WILL BE BACK TOMORROW."}
{"text":"We were hot & tired from a day outside and wanted a quick bite.

Unfortunately the grilled chicken sandwich is the only remotely \"healthy\" options though no wheat bun option.  The chicken was an actual chicken breast, not processed chicken.

My hunny got the beef hot dog and ate it in 3 bites.

I would have rather had the turtle sundae!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Freddy's, all the food is delicious and the staff is always very friendly. I love the atmosphere and the retro theme, they always have the best music playing. It's a very family friendlyor date worthy environment."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim as i was visiting family in Concord. I had never had frozen custard before so we stopped in to try it. They have it in shake, sundae and concrete form.  I had no idea what a concrete was lol but the associate behind the counter explained it to me. I got a concrete in the PBC&B flavor (which is peanut butter cup and bananas) and it was DELICIOUS! I especially liked that Jamie, the general manager, came over and talked to our table. He's doing a great job and would definitely come again to try the food."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, food was great and all the employees were nice from the front end,  to the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"So i have ate here a couple times the food is okay. I don't have any real positive or negative things to say about freddies. It is just okay burgers and okay deserts. I would come back if i came with someone who wanted to try it for a first time but not sure that i would go out of my way to come back on my own.  Again its okay."}
{"text":"I was told that they were over priced and tasteless burgers, so I decided to try it out  and sure enough got a burger with paper thin patties no flavor and they charge extra for every additional item on your burger, I would avoid this location. There are plenty locations more reasonable and better tasting food."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious and the concrete was amazing. Best onion rings I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Very clean. Fast courteous service and great food. Plus the custard is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Not too far from my office. The place had a few customers, but was not very crowded.

The burger was ok, the hot dog was good, and the fries were crispy, but thin. Not my thing. Prefer the thicker fries.

All around there are better choices - Five Guys, The Habit, and Smashburger."}
{"text":"Decent food and wait times but I really live Freddys for their French fries and sauce."}
{"text":"This is NO regular fast food burger joint!  Their staff has great character and are quick to take care overall, their humble service was awesome!  Their whole environment was pretty nice! clean bathrooms (yay!) and a well kept up parking lot! I was surprised to see a drive-thru! then again... this is Vegas! how awesome is that!  but I'm not lazy, I like to take my time when I can and enjoy what I paid for! lol!!!

As far as the food went:  YUM-O!  I love the lil fries and to top it off that crazy sauce!!! lol  the fries had MY right amount of salt! (I'm downing lots of water tonight! lol)  so, if you don't like too much salt, hey! mention it!!  you'll get fresh fries I bet!
the steak burger single was what I ordered. it was just right for me, but now I know when I come back hungry: double it plz!!  I got all but the onions... usually I don't do the pickles... but I figured, why not!  and boy did that make a yummy difference! it was snappy!  I like the clean counter access of big humongous over size foster family size ketchup to top my burger any which way possible!!! :-)  lol!!  

I like the variety a lot! Since I am cutting back on my splurging, I didn't try the custard... but! that means another reason to go back!  momma always said, ice cream never goes bad in the winter, I'm assuming that goes for Custard!   
so, when winter comes, I will be swinging by!  hopefully, they'll be playing some 50's rock n roll to change the mood!  thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Love the food and the service is great!! Philly cheese steak and the steak burger both were great for sure we will be back for more wish there was one in Vegas"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat fast food. being new to the neighborhood my family went to try. and we found it is really good!  It is always busy but delivers speedy and yummy food. The prices are a little high for fast food - but worth the occasional treat!"}
{"text":"Ok ... I have to admit, first, that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years ... then I stopped into Freddy's one day, and haven't gone to In N Out since!  The service is great, the food is AMAZINGLY good, and the atmosphere is fun and fresh.  You will not be disappointed!  I do the California Double Combo ... give them a try!"}
{"text":"Such a good burger and hot dog! Plus you cannot beat those skinny fries mmmm and the fry sauce!! The onion rings are also delightful!!!! Just like in Austin Tx"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  They have the best french fries of any restaurant!  I'm generally not a fan of thin burgers, but I do love these.  Onion rings were terrific.  I tried the new mushroom / swiss burger which was fantastic (order it with easy sauce).  Some of the best, most friendly staff you'll ever meet in a restaurant.  My only complaint, get rid of Pepsi and bring in Coke! Otherwise, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Probably one of the strangest places I've eaten lately but good.  The burgers are the strangest things to me with thin over cooked patties on ho hum bread.  Was chuckling Over the fact that they offer \"California style\" (trying to copy In n Out) burgers hat again aren't all that good.   French fries are shoestring and not great portions.  I do however highly recommend the custard.  It's smooth, silky and have great great flavor."}
{"text":"My absolute fav place for burgers and fries. I love the thin patties (get a double or triple if you like thick burgers) and the skinny fries are the best fries anywhere!  Love the seasoning and the fry sauce. Yum. Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and delicious Custard!!! Best fast food burger in Vegas much better than In and Out... Don't forget extra freddy's Sauce"}
{"text":"If I'd known my burger was going to be so sloppy I couldn't have picked it up I would have ordered differently. My hatch green chili burger sounded delicious. As a matter of fact when hubby told me I could get green chili on my burger at Freddy's that is what convinced me to eat there.  His number 7 burger was as it should be. Mine?  Not so much. The bottom bun was so soggy it soaked the paper liner in the basket. Trying to pick it up found me with a gooey mess with grilled onions falling out and green chili mess running down my wrist to plop in the basket. I found knife and fork. Shortly after an employee asked how everything was and I shared with him my dissatisfaction, I nearly vomited when a bite gave me a little something .... Extra..... Ewww gross! Chewey woody green Chili stem... I hope... I HOPE that's what it was. Maybe??? It was pale amounting to about the size of a cashew.  My stomach turned over!

Hubby's burger was lovely! 

He's gonna have to sweet talk me to get me any where near Freddy's any again this year. Yuck!! 

One star for nice fries which remind us of our beloved Steak n Shake. One star for hubbies nice burger."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant anytime I am near here I have to stop for a burger so I can have their fry sauce. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmm. Delish. Staff is friendly and pretty timely. Their concretes are legit."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger was great, I dipped it in jalapeño fry sauce and fell in love instantly. The patties don't come pre-shaped so I don't feel like questioning whether or not it's real beef(which it tastes like it is real. Juicy too). The restaurant was clean and brightly lit, and the staff was friendly. I don't normally write reviews, but seeing as this place was pretty empty at night is nothing short of a shame. Eat here ASAP."}
{"text":"We love Freddy's and were so excited to see a location open up right at Lake Pleasant and Happy Valley! Went through the drive thru the first week they opened. It was quick, the order was accurate and the food was delicious! I tried the jalapeno fry sauce and while spicy, it was very good! Fried pickles were delicious and the burger was fantastic! I know some of the other Freddy's offers cheese curds like the one on Bell Road, but when I asked this location they said they didn't offer them. Hopefully it's something they can eventually add to the menu! Overall very happy with the service and food and will return!"}
{"text":"I might have found a new addiction - Freddy's. Not sure why I have never been here before but I will be from now on!

We drove by this place over the weekend and I didn't know what it was, so I came back in for lunch. Their food is great, service is fantastic and it's very clean.

I had the patty melt, which was a tad too greasy, but it's a patty melt so you're basically asking for grease. It was good though. The fries were awesome - I don't normally like shoestring fries, but these were cooked perfectly. And they have fry sauce. Yes, fry sauce. That I think clinched it for me. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but for a person like me who normally mixes ketchup with ranch dressing for her fries, this stuff was YUMmy.

I was too full from lunch to try any of the frozen custard - sundaes, concrete mixers, or anything else - but next time i will have to plan things out so I can have both. Maybe just a basket of fries (with a ton of sauce) and a sundae."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Good Chicago dogs made with Vienna hot dogs. The custard is awesome. Great family place to eat at. The employees love their jobs and treat you very well."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Freddy's.

I ordered a double patty melt to go. The staff was very friendly, but he food was so-so.

A patty melt done right is a 'party in your mouth'.  My tongue is instead mourning...

The rye bread was _nicely_ toasted, but it was obviously not toasted using butter.  That was sin #1.  

The \"double\" patty turned out to be a single patty of thin shoe leather-like meat. Sin #2.

Every good patty melt I have enjoyed in the past includes yellow mustard to cut through the richness of the double cheese.  No mustard detected. Sin #3."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're from the west coast and have had In n Out this is similar. Super yummy and affordable food. I love the shoestring fries and the thin patties. The custard is amazing as well. A must try place the staff is always nice and helpful. I go once a week it's so good. Try the Freddy's fry sauce and the seasoning salt."}
{"text":"Freddy's has become a great place for my son and I to stop in after soccer practice and grab a burger, fries and shake. Very friendly customer service. I didn't give 5 stars because the food can get pricey. Oh and they have yummy Fry Sauce!"}
{"text":"What can I say, if you absolutely love a good burger with cheese, bacon whatever this is a very meaty burger. A type of burger to indulge. No nonsense and also the custards and hot dogs are fantastic. So come and have a real cheat meal because you only live once. The fries are piping hot shoestring btw and there's this fry sauce that is basically like a red pepper aioli that taste fantastic on everything. I would say this is just behind in-out burger and ahead of Shake Shack with its own authenticity and that's saying allot with five guys, habit and other chains getting in on the burger market."}
{"text":"Wow, what a bummer. I was expecting SO much better than this -- been on a major burger trek lately throughout mesa trying to find the best places, and this one is at the bottom of my list.  I had one of their steak burgers, and it was disgusting.  The taste, and consistency were WAY off. The patty is thin as can be to save on cost, but I didn't even finish the burger !  A few of the staff members looked like they were on drugs, and not practicing basic hygiene.  Gross.

Looking around as I was trying to eat --- I realize this place is full of the older generation ; possibly because of the \"retro\" styling.... do they have any taste buds left? I sincerely doubt it.  I was the only young person in there on a Friday afternoon during the lunch period.  Very strange, and telling... 

Fries were the best part of the meal , and with pricing that high -- I expect a lot better service and food quality.  I will not be back here again, if ever.   I highly recommend steering clear from this place because the food quality is null and the pricing is totally overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"We have visited twice since they opened.  Both times the staff has been friendly, service has been promt and food tasty. I like the hamburgers have a \"'crust\" on them, obviously cooked on a flat top. Fries are very good and I like the Pepsi products they offer.  Nice to have a fast, tasty place to eat in this part of town. 

We will return"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint. Besides having great burger combos, the fry sauce is delicious. The frozen custard is so smooth, and dare I say yummy. The history of Freddy is worth a read and is an added bonus. A must try!"}
{"text":"I waited in the drive through for a good 15 minutes I was the only customer in the drive through then they messed up the pricing of my order ended up charging me more then and I couldn't even get a refund back."}
{"text":"Burgers- good. Shoestring fries & fry sauce- awesome. Custards & cones- awesome. Staff- great! Worth the drive across town. Open more please."}
{"text":"Went to buy one of there custard cakes for some co workers for a nice little treat. And by far had to of been the most embarrassing/worst things I could of done... Talk about all whipped cream barely any of the custard was in the cake... Spent about 30 bucks.. Too over priced for what I was given... I've had way better from Freddy's but man are you guys going down hill lately not to mention I've been coming there since it first open and it just seems to be getting worse...."}
{"text":"Pros: Fairly quick, but fresh food. Wide variety in the menu. Good tasting burgers.

Cons: Location is a bit tricky to get in to and out of. It can be busy.

Details: I have been here a few times and found the burgers above average. The service is really what I like about this place. The staff is very friendly and quick. I am not a big frozen custard fan so I cannot speak to the taste, but it looks good."}
{"text":"The Bacon burger was big and juicy and the fries here are really good. They go great with the shakes/blizzards here which are called concretes. I've only tried one but it was awesome. Last time we went through the drive thru and we thought it was pretty quick but the lady at the register apologized for the \"wait.\" That's good customer service in my eyes. I would highly recommend this location to everyone!"}
{"text":"For me, Double Steakburger California Style is the best item on the menu. Love their string fries and fry sauce. Great customer service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place. It's up there next  to In n Out lol 
First lets start with the customer service since they are always so nice and cheerful when I walk in like they missed me or something. On our first visit there they gave us a free custard and they come around and take your trash, it's the little things that matter. 

Second the steak burger is quite amazing I leave it original and love my fries crispy. The fries my just be my favorite they are thin and crispy and not greasy. I also like their hot dogs they are amazing I can't even describe. 

Then finally their custards are like little cups of heaven. Something like ice cream but smoother and with tons of extra toppings. 

Overall a great place to eat and take the family."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food. A great treat!"}
{"text":"Went to Freddys for the first time tonight, now I'm asking why did I wait for so long?!?!??  Got the double bacon steakburger with regular fries. 

The fries were just okay by the time I got home.  The problem with them being so thin n' crispy is that they get super cold super fast if you get it takeout.  Still good though.  I DEMOLISHED them once I tasted them with the fry sauce.  Goodbye Ranch, we had a good run...

Now, the burger.  It was hot, fresh, and BIG, with crispy bacon and a nice soft bun.  The burger had just enough grease to give you that \"oooooohhh yeeaahhh\" feeling when you bite into it.   The taste was great with the umami being balanced with the mustard, bacon, and onion.  Then I had the probably-not-original idea to pour the rest of my fry sauce onto my burger, and that was it.  All other fast food places (except for Five Guys), can rely on other unsuspecting, clueless folk bc THIS FORMER unsuspecting, clueless patron is all about Freddy's!

I can't believe this, but I'm gonna go get another Freddys burger.  I promise, I'm only a size 10...lol!

**LATER:  yes, I went back and got another burger...yes, it was just as good as the 1st**"}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience at this little burger spot! The staff is seriously friendly and accommodating. I don't usually eat at burger places like this but I was trying to avoid a cop seeing my dead tags and I turned in here unexpectedly. When the staff realized it was our first time they offered us 4 free custards, and they were actually great. They put a bunch of extra sauce, ketchup and napkins in the bag without being asked and the food hit the spot!! Eat here!!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers and meat! This place is so unique and delicious. Hands down one of the best burger drive thru. I get the California style burger and it is sooo yummy, love how the meat is crispy at the ends so unique. We also get their custard when we are wanting some dessert, it is amazing! This place has it all"}
{"text":"Not impressed!

I decided to try this place one night; I ordered a burger , fries , and a small custard. The burger was greasy and the flavor was dominated by their mystery sauce. Fries were too thin for my taste. As a result of being thin, they soak up a lot of oil. The custard was good, but too heavy after the feast of grease.

The meal cost me $12 bucks. Do yourself a favor and go to in n out, your wallet and taste buds will be better off."}
{"text":"First time eating at Freddy's I was immediately greeted by the staff very welcoming!! Ordered Chicago dog with concrete and it was delish! I highly recommend their hot dogs. I will definitely return- very clean atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Just visited the drive thru and double bacon burger was awesome! Onion rings were great and so was the Turtle Concrete! The excellent customer service is a deep breath of fresh air here in Vegas! Thank you! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Freddy's has amazing burgers!! Their steak burgers wrapped in lettuce are full of flavor I personally love jalapeños in mine... The service is just as good as the food and on top of that they have custard! The custard is a dessert I recommend you leave room for.. The only thing I dislike are the fries I am not a huge fan of the shoestring style French fry but their burger  is so good I can look past the fries :)"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Scottsdale to here just to try this place out. Great recommendation! My husband and I loved it!! Will be back again and again! Goodbye size six pants! Haha"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this place tonight. I paid $11.36 for two small concretes and a child single scoop of vanilla. I asked for Oreo and cookie dough in them and I was mega disappointed when I got home to find that they were basically just vanilla. 1. They were tiny! I know I ordered small but I expected something the size of sonics small not this baby kid ice cream. (See size comparison to a water bottle in picture) And 2. They charged me an extra $1.20 for topping in them and there was practically nothing added! I waited through their obnoxiously long line and would not have complained about it, but this was just a waste of time and money! So I paid $11.36 for some baby small vanilla ice cream! Thanks Freddy's"}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona from the east coast a few months ago. We thought we'd never find a family restaurant we loved as much as Friendly's BUT once we tried Freddy's we felt like we were at home. Freddy's has been consistently great, with friendly and outgoing staff to compliment the food we love so much. 

Tonight they made an honest mistake with our order on one of the Concrete custards. Not only did they recognize the mistake and fix it right away, they went above and beyond. We would have continued to patronize them based on the quality of food and friendly service alone but the staff, all the way up to the manager made us feel like we were THE most important customer they ever had. 

Kudos to you and your staff for excellence in service and providing an exceptionally fun and delicious food."}
{"text":"Freddy's is not bad at all and the prices are reasonable. The burger is acceptably good and the shoestring fries are also on par.

Some of the employees were not that excited to be there when we went, but that didn't take too much away from the experience. Freddy's has good cheap food and for that I shall return!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best fast food restaurants around. The food is always fresh and hot. The service is always friendly and helpful. From their burgers to fries to their custard (ice cream), , it's all good!"}
{"text":"Their Chilli cheese fries are sooo so so good!!!! The fries hardly get soggy even til the end! Loved it! Would go back! Maybe tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Not sure where to start really. First off, the thin burgers with crispy edges are awesome. Definitely go for the double with bacon and jalapeños.  The manager we talked to is Avery, and our experience with him was even better than the food! It's my son's 9th birthday, and he definitely made it a special one. We're blessed to have crossed paths with Avery, and would definitely recommend this location!!!"}
{"text":"Be sure to grab the padded part of the doors leading to the dining room!

Interior is quite large for a fast food place.  Decor is red and gray/chrome.  Like a fast food diner, or quick-serve version of Red Robin.  The cashier was competent and cordial.

I ordered a vanilla shake with Mint syrup.  It's very \"fluffy\" and less dense than ice cream/soft serve/yogurt.  I also love the extra large super wide straw!  It was very creamy, but not too thick.

I've yet to try their food, but I can definitely endorse the frozen custard.  Price was about $5 for a large shake."}
{"text":"Let me just say, as a Midwesterner I've really missed Steak N' Shake. This is my shining salvation. The customer service was amazing! It was quick and easy on my wallet. The shake I got very nearly compared to the ones back in my home town. I've only got one complaint though. My fry's were super salty. If I'd been a slug I would've died. Other than that amazing food!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this location, the service was slow and the burgers were over cooked. It was only a week after opening, so I just assumed the staff were still training. 
The second visit was pleasant and the staff were very friendly. The service was still a little slow, but several people in front of me also ordered custard, so it wasn't a big deal. The custard was delicious, and is definitely recommend. I got the concrete mixed with Reese's and hot fudge, and it was worth the wait.
I finally decided to try their burgers again, because the location near concord mills is always good. The second burger I got was a lot better than the first. It was juicy and still crisp around the edges like a good steak burger should be. I will definitely frequent this location and recommend everyone give it a try for the burgers and custard."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite burger places. Everything is fresh. The he buns are warm, and the fries are the thin fries with just the right amount of crispness. For dessert, if you have room, you can't beat the turtle sundae. If you have your own fries and don't split, you probably won't have room for the sundae. The chocolate cones are also delicious."}
{"text":"had to hit freddy's after my disappointment with culver's
love this place! great steak burgers and custard!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this visit. I've gone to Freddy's on trips to Cali and was excited to take my husband. It wasn't very clean and the people weren't very friendly. I'm all about customer service and you can tell they only did what they were told. Didn't much appreciate the manager doing a team meeting in plain sight while several of us were waiting to place our order. I didn't look like a good meeting either. The stars are simply because it's a Freddy's in general."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time by recommendation by a coworker. We couldn't think of what to eat and he came up with this place. Located right across from Krispy Kreme in the huge Target Plaza on Silverado Ranch & Eastern, next to Freed's Bakery. 

They offer a drive-thru option, which was what i picked. The idea of steakburgers reminds me of Steak & Shake in South Point Casino & Hotel. Thin, flat-topped cooked burger patties and shoestring fries. Made my car smell very yummy ! 

The fries, you actually get quite the bit. Both orders were full to the brim and falling out into the bag. Lightly seasoned and salted. Pretty yummy ! Quite similar to what you'd get from Steak & Shake, but much more in quantity

They don't have a lot of burger options but they are fairly simple burgers, without all the fluff. No chili cheese or guacamole or BBQ sauce. Only simple original single/double/triple, bacon and cheese, California style, and patty melt

We had ordered a Double Steakburger California Style which includes two steakburger patties, cheese, full slice of onion, Freddy's sauce, lettuce, and tomato served on a toasted bun. 

Overall a fairly simple burger with the normal fixings. Lettuce was chopped up vs the usual leaf of lettuce you'd usually see. A full slice of onion is not a ring or two of onion, but literally a centimeter cross section of an onion with all the rings it inside. Patties are pressed quite flat with cheese in between. Not sure what Freddy's sauce is as I couldn't really taste where/what it was. 

Can't compare to the nearby places like Red Robin or In-n-Out or Shake Steak. Completely different. Closest thing is Steak & Shake and i find it quite comparable to each other. Great to have another place that offers steakburgers outside of South Point. Much more easily accessible. It is a pretty decent size burger in comparison to what you'd get in Steak & Shake. Prices are comparable, if not better pricing than Steak & Shake."}
{"text":"Fast food that is fresh and done well will be my undoing!

Freddy's is our new drive-thru go to. Everything is made fresh and the menu has so many things you could want. I've tried the Steakburgers, cheese/chili fries, chicken tenders - all really yummy. Fries are shoestring and always so excellently seasoned. Drown me in their fry sauce.

I've yet to try the hot dogs but they look pretty good as well. They also have tons of fresh custard creations and funnel cake too. I'll probably be back for another round soon, god help me...

Maybe a buck or two pricier than McDonald's etc but at least the food is fresh, real, and not hours old. I still have love for what McDonald's used to be, but can't roll the dice anymore with their terrible workers and old stale food. 

Glad there are places like Freddy's that is doing fast food right!"}
{"text":"I would recommend Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers for a tasty burger combo. 

I tried Freddy's tonight for the first time using the drive through. The line was short and it moved quick. The employees were friendly on the intercom and at the window. 

I ordered a Double Steakburger California Style combo (#6 on the menu.) 
This was a great burger. The burger patties were smashed thin on the grill and covered in cheese. Toppings on the burger included onion, tomato, lettuce and Freddy's sauce. 

For some reason, I didn't get a top bun. I had to check pictures on Yelp to see if the California Style option was supposed to be topless, but no, it appears to have been a mistake on my order. I really didn't mind the error too much because the burger was still pretty amazing how it was (and I probably don't need the extra carbs... how did they know?)

The combo included shoestring fries and the employee at the window offered fry sauce and ketchup. The fries were thin, crispy and plentiful, and the fry sauce was a very tasty addition. 

I look forward to trying Freddy's again. Their dessert menu looks very tempting."}
{"text":"Shoe string French fries, need I say more?  Thin, crunchy little delights.  oh, and the burger isn't bad either.  Stop by on a Friday evening, and there are usually some old cars to check out in the parking lot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner, this was the first time here. I had the #6 combo and my girlfriend had the #5 combo. The food was good and the staff was very polite and helpful. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Up until a few years ago, the only thing I had ever known about this place was that they served custard, and the thought of Frozen Custard had always been intriguing to me. I was never sure about their burgers and such until my best friend exclaimed she wanted Freddy's one day. I thought it was pretty good, but it was never on my radar because it isn't exactly close to home. 

Fast-forward a few years, and I introduced Freddy's to one of my school friends and he LOVES it. Every Tuesday and Thursday, you can find us there, in our favorite booth, both eating the Single Steakburger California Style (California Style is basically their version of an In-n-Out burger, and WAY better) with fries and extra sides of ranch."}
{"text":"Good food and service just a slight problem me and my friends came here to get a bite we all had 100s and they basically said they couldn't help us seems like they never seen a 100 dollar bill or don't appreciate people that actually have money and not paying with change"}
{"text":"Great burger & fries the custard was lacking something. Nielsens custard is way better."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place. but it's steak and shake food with 5 guys prices. I LOVE thin burgers and hate big huge ones but the patties here are as if they sliced a mcdonalds patty in half, they are SO thin. 2 barley makes one normal patty.
For the taste and price I'll stick to five guys."}
{"text":"For fast food burgers it is very good and the service was excellent. Very courteous and friendly. Food was tasty and They even have real bananas for the shakes! 

Military discount on Mondays."}
{"text":"Oh Freddy, where have you been all my life? Obviously on a side of town I rarely frequent, but I am so glad I did. Your fries are amazing.. your jalapeño fry sauce is to die for.. and this burger? LIFE CHANGING. Please open a SW location and I promise to visit you more often."}
{"text":"I was told about this place from my sister who lives in Denver and she raves about the hotdogs, but also loves the burgers and fry's. So I went to give this place a try and fell in love, after my first visit I have decided that this is my favorite new burger place, not only is the food and the price point great but the customer service was outstanding, every one I encountered there was very friendly and helpful especially one of the managers Olivia who told me all about the company and where they were from and made me feel at home there. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and world class customer service. 

Thank you to all the crew at this Freddy's"}
{"text":"Decided to pull through the drive-thru on my first visit; the double drive thru was pretty busy on a Friday evening at 7. I ordered Chicago dogs and a Freddy's original double steakburger. I love that they actually offer a burger that contains almost exactly what I request at other burger joints: onion, mustard, pickles - I usually request lettuce too, but Freddy's standard option was fine.  I took a drink of their pretty good unsweetened tea. Score!  As for the Chicago dog, I tried it, it wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't like a Chicago dog I used to get at deli formerly in Waxhaw -whose owners were actually from Chicago.   As for the Original double steakburger - \"Where's the beef?\"  The \"burgers\" were hand patted no doubt and crispy on the edges which made them really good. However, the patties were almost see-through thin - think White Castle or Krystal Burgers. \"Freddy\" is really proud of his food - it's not cheap: Chicago dog - $4.19, Double Steakburger - $5.29."}
{"text":"Pretty great food but a little pricy for what it is. We got a couple of menu items and wound up spending almost 30$. That being said the burgers fries and concretes are all great. The staff is REALLY friendly. On a slow day the cashier chatted with us until our meal came out and double checked to make sure our order was exactly how we wanted. 

Now to the important thing: the food. Smashed steak burgers that are reminiscent of cheese steak sandwiches. The paties are thin which means that every bite is browned and yummy. The fries are just regular fries but they are great holders for the Freddy's fry sauce which is addicting."}
{"text":"Crisp edges, sweet onion, thick cut pickle slices, yellow mustard and melty cheese... perfect. 

Onion rings... yes please. 

Don't be turned off by the typical red and white 50's style decor... or the fact that a guy named Freddy didn't start this joint... This place serves up the Best Fast Food Burgers.  And they have fried pickles and onion rings... what's not to love?!  Get a Freddy's Original Double and eat happy...


** I was informed they no longer carry fried pickles?!   Tragic**"}
{"text":"Loved the Kansas-style burgers, very unique and tasty. It's hard to describe them, I would say the best way is if you took a steak, chopped it up very fine with a knife, and somehow were able to put it back all together. It's not the greatest description so you will have to go there and find out for yourself. The meat itself could have used a tad more seasoning. Shoestring fries were perfectly cooked. Thin and crispy, again, just a little bit more seasoning. All the employees were very friendly and even the manager came out to see if everything was OK, I liked that. Those milkshakes looked amazing, gonna have to try some next time."}
{"text":"I was completely miss led when i was brought here by my brother.  IN N OUT is a million times better than this place.  and frankly im not a huge fan of in n out i mean its good but nothing to get excited about.  dont bother coming here go somewhere else. shoot go to the mcDs on 59th an bell"}
{"text":"Food and service were both amazing.  Loved the jalapeño fry sauce and my husband said that the fudge concrete shake was the best he ever had."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for lunch.  The outside is so appealing, and we thought it might be kind of like Steak n Shake.  I ordered a single burger and was surprised that it came with pickles, mustard and onions.  I did not care for the burger.  The texture was strange.  It was kind of chewy.  The chili was okay as were the fries.  I can't think of any reason why I would return."}
{"text":"this place is fantastic.  good burgers that really are a step up from the regular fast food or burger joint.   great fries and amazing concrete.  not the place to go if you are trying to drop a few pounds but a nice treat every once and a bit.
great food - simple menu - great prices - fast and friendly service and clean.
what else is there?"}
{"text":"I don't know what to think. I've been going here since they've opened and always had good food and good service. Then I see they got 4 major health code violations. They were told to clean up or could get shut down. OH MY !"}
{"text":"Get your Burgers when u eat them they moo at u . The bread on the buns look like Beyoncé bounce a hot topic"}
{"text":"Make sure to indicate you are ordering a sundae or shake.  I ordered a PBC&B three times before they finally gave me the sundae not a shake.  Perhaps they should ask \"Shake or Sundae\" when something they offer has the same name for multi items."}
{"text":"We asked Google tp find us a fast food place with a drive through, I then read  the reviews , the distance of which it was located  from where we're driving & lastly they were open till 10pm...bonus!!!
For the record we were hungry from bowling league and just wanted something different & Freddy's delivered, so much so we called after hours to say the burgers we're on point!
Thank you"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Freddy's.  We started going when we were in Texas on vacation and then the opened this location and WOW...we had a favorite.

We have been to this location several times and the location in Gilbert twice.  It used to be that EVERY time we went it was AMAZING!!  Now, it is hit or miss.  Last visit to this location the fries were WAY overcooked...quality control would tell you not to send out burnt fries, but no they sent them right out to us.  I think the little burger has shrunk and it was small before.  

Ouch, why is it that when you start to really love a place it goes downhill?  Well, at least In & Out burger stays consistant and since I now live in SoCal I guess we won't be missing Freddy's anymore."}
{"text":"I first found Freddy's on a family trip to Texas.  Now I am able to enjoy it on business trips.  This location is easy to find and has the same quality of all their stores.  Unique high quality fresh burgers, great fries and try the custard."}
{"text":"Very good double steak burger and I must say the fries were really good, food was still hot when I got home!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been to this location and it is worse than the first. 

The onion rings were disgusting they tasted like they were cooked in really old and dirty oil. The color of the onion rings were gross too, they looked extremely burnt but weren't, just really really dark.

The burgers are nothing special either. Over cooked flimsy patties trying to be an in and out rip off (not even close btw)

The service also leaves a lot to be desired.. 1:50pm, only 3 cars in the drive thru, and it took over 30 minutes waiting in line from ordering to receiving the order.

I'm all for giving places a second chance but that's it for me, first time was an awful experience and so was the second. Food is edible but subpar and service needs a face lift. That's all the info I need to never go back."}
{"text":"If you want your food fast, don't go through the drive-through. If you want your food fresh, definitely go through the drive-through! The fries are delicious thin cut, hot and fresh and the steak burgers are fantastic! I ordered my steak burger California style.  Don't forget to get your shake!"}
{"text":"Things I love about this place:  frozen custard, amazing delicious burgers, fry sauce.  All of those made my stomach very happy.  Replace any fast food place with this one and you will never be disappointed"}
{"text":"Not bad but not amazing. Be aware that their hamburgers are super thin just like their shoestring french fries. My husband said his burger was rather tasteless. Service at this location was probably the best thing about the entire visit. All the employees were friendly, happy, and accommodating.  We enjoyed our first ever visit to Freddy's, I'm sure we'll try it again, however I would have rather driven to Culver's instead."}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars, but our Freddie's has changed there buns.  We went about 6 weeks ago and the buns were different.  Smaller.  So we waited just to be sure that the restaurant hadn't run out of buns and ran to the local store for more.  Well, yesterday we Tried again.  Sadly the buns were still small.  The taste just wasn't the same as it has been.  The meat hanging out of the bun is flavorless, and hard to hold with such a small bun.  The fries were great!  We probably will not be going back nearly as much as we did.  Hopefully we will hear that they have brought back larger buns."}
{"text":"Didn't hear about this place opening, just happened to drive by and decided to try it. I ordered a California style single steakburger. The California part is the thousand island like sauce they call Freddy sauce. 

The patty melt is amazing!!! I recommend getting the freddy sauce on it. 

Every time I've been there, the drive thru people are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Not sure where these high ratings are coming from but if I were to compare Freddys to Wendy's I'd put them on par. They certainly don't compare to In&Out Burger especially on the price point, but I do give then the edge on the fries at Freddys. As you can see from this pic the steak burger is...well should I say, not so much a steak more like sliver. The burger is sooo thin the sliced onion was thicker. Flavor again just ok, but of course I love gourmet burgers. The custard was tasty. I had the turtle sundae, but if you want really good custard stuck with Rita's. Although my first visit feel a bit FLAT, the service was GREAT and the restaurant CLEAN. I'll visit again if I'm in the area and taste for a quick burger. In&Out still remains my quick stop burger spot."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and at different times and have received great service. Tonight I walked in and there was one person that was taking orders bussing tables and doing drive through! I appreciate her hard work and she is great with customers. Stopping whatever she was doing to assist me. Chanal or shanal you are doing great. Back house always has the food on point. It would be great if the supervisor on the shift would recognize the hard work. Thursday 5:07pm"}
{"text":"This place was aight.  The burger was too salty and the fries are shoestring.  Boo hisss"}
{"text":"Very courteous and efficient staff. Absolutely appreciate it and go out of my way to stop by for a treat. Thanks again, I've seen many shifts and you this location is consistently timely and kind!"}
{"text":"The fries are perfect.
I don't eat meat but I love their milk shakes and frozen custards.
My husband can't have enough of their steak burgers."}
{"text":"This is not my type of burger. I'm not even sure it was beef.  It comes out with a weird beef/grease netting like texture. That is incredibly thin and dried out. I guess they get points for being different, just not my cup of tea.  The food is incredibly salty and greasy. Which I guess can be expected, but it seemed overly so to me.

In didn't try the ice cream while I was there, but it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Everything went well on my 2nd visit(my first to this location) until I went to get my frozen custard which I put \"on hold.\"  They said it was \"coming right up so I waited and waited.  Then I got the item that wasn't my dirt and worms.  So they said they'd get me another and I said \"just get me a cone.\"  I can understand being busy but how do you mess up prepaid custard?"}
{"text":"Love this place; great food and they really care about keeping their customers happy :)"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in all of vegas! 

These people are extremely nice, and go out of their way to make everything right. The hamburgers taste like they are home cooked. The cajun fries are great too! My kid loves coming to this place, as do I! The prices are really fair and it's a frequent place in my book."}
{"text":"First time here, only went through drive through. I only had the hot dog but I was thoroughly impressed. Perhaps the best hot dog I have had in quite a while."}
{"text":"Love , love , love this place !!! The food is amazing and at a great price!! Love when they have hatch green chile burgers !! The service is good and everyone is nice !"}
{"text":"Went through drive thru to order floats and not one but 2 cashiers couldn't understand that I wanted a coke float. Drove to the window and the cashier acted and looked at me like she don't know what a coke float was but she knew what a root beer float is. The reason why I came here is because they have a sign that says shakes, malts and floats. Cashier tells me they don't have coke but they got Pepsi...ok...so can I have a Pepsi float then? Geez! They should change the sign to just root beer float then. And when I received my regular size coke float that cost $4.59 it was such a rip off! Cup was only filled half way. I can only imagine what I would've got if i ordered a small. I should've followed my gut and went to a more professional dessert place and get more bang for my buck at Nielsens."}
{"text":"my review is more like a 3.5. My attempt to find the best burger in Las Vegas continues. I am still at heart, an in-n-out fan, with Five guys coming in at a close 2nd. Freddy's has only one location in the entire Las Vegas. It just happens to be down the street from my dentist. I got the #7. which is a double steakburger with bacon. unlike Five guys, in-n-out or even smashburger, their burgers are pressed, flattened sort to speak.  It was good, but i prefer my burgers thick and meaty.the flavors were right and overall it was a good burger. The service was fast, the place was really nice. It was busy, i dont know if it is because this was the only location in town, or because the area is just really busy. They serve shoe string fries, really thin, with very light seasoning. different, but good.. but nothing amazing. The highlight was probably  their custard. Again, not too sweet, and they had fry sauce. which was basically a thousand island with a little less zing, not bland, but mild. I would go again, but only if i am on that side of town,  I wouldn't drive that far, for a burger."}
{"text":"Just got a strawberry vanilla shake and strawberry cheesecake shake.... Sooo yummy. First time here and it was great. I look forward to coming back and trying the food!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru and ordered dinner for my family. Including my elderly grandmother who has a very strict no salt diet. I asked them to make a burger with no salt. When I got home they had made her burger patty with salt. So I was really upset and I called. I spoke to the manager and he apologized and said that he would drive the new order to my house!!!!! I said that wasn't required but he insisted! He was at my house in ten minutes with the freshly made order and coupons for free Freddy's!!! There is still customer service left in this world! This place deserves 10 stars! Not to mention the food is good too."}
{"text":"Low prices, classic flavors, I'm a fan. I pop by more often for dessert (the mini size is where it's at!) than meals but the service is consistently quick and friendly. Their burgers, when I do have them, are okay, but the patties are thin and have been dry at times. They use a lot of cheese though, so it kind of balances out. Their skinny fries are pretty standard, appreciate the pumps of fry sauce in the lobby- dine in to take advantage!"}
{"text":"The new cheese curds are awesome!!!
Best I've ever had and I know my cheese curds... being from Wisconsin.
Love the burgers, patty melt and chicken, too.
Staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place to eat I recommend the the California burger! The fries are sooooo good! I like to eat there often as I can!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great. decent price, enjoyed my lunch"}
{"text":"I had Freddys in San tan valley. I was excited for it to open so close to my neighborhood. I went to this Freddy's back when they first opened with my two sons. The place was packed and there was no where to sit. One open table was closest to the counter. I've not been back since because of it. 

Their food execution really is horrible and made me wish I'd gone to 5 guys in the same plaza. My burger was so greasy the bun was soaking wet and I couldn't understand why bc the burgers are so thin and additionally my party was so crispy I felt like I was eating a beef chip between two buns. My son doesn't like like hamburgers so he had chicken and he said it tasted like fried frozen chicken. Maybe it was. My other son had a hamburger but he cursed me for not going to the other place so I told him to eat it and I'll get him ice cream. He did and we did. 

The flow of foot traffic through this place is irritating. The table we had to sit at since we ate in is next to the line and  it just so happens I had direct scent and sight to everyone's below the waist. I wanted to move but then I saw the staff bus the tables. Let's sweep up the floor with the broom and oh there's stuff on the bench let's use the same broom to sweep off the bench. C'mon! 

I know what it's like working in food service my first jobs were in fast food and waiting tables and many front and back end restaurant jobs. The places I worked at had video classes you had to take on restaurant work etiquette and take a test to pass. 

Food: fail greasy burgers overcooked patty
Cleanliness: with a glance it's clean but spot checking fail
Staff: some were nice and some appeared clueless or angry that you ordered food.
Restaurant in general: I want to like Freddys Butts in my face is not cool. Let's fix that? 

I gave them two stars because the kids loved the custard. 

I'd be more than happy to visit when I see consistent positive yelp reviews on this place. Otherwise I'll skip the drive thru and make a phone order to 5 guys."}
{"text":"Most people would've considered this a BAD experience, but I am going to give five stars to this location for their customer service. I walked in to place my to go order of two cheeseburgers and one order of fries, and waited for what I thought was a little too long. (I was mumbling to myself a little as I was tired and ready to go home). When the manager handed me the bag of food, she also handed me 2 complimentary coupons for 2 future combos and apologized for the delay. I was impressed. That's not all. I got all the way home, only to find that I had two grilled cheese sandwiches in my bag instead of cheeseburgers. 
I called the store, and came back to make the exchange. The same manager, her name is 'Heaven', was clearly mortified of this second error, not to mention the people who got my cheeseburgers won't be happy either. By the time I got back to make the exchange, Heaven had  refunded the entire amount back to my card, apologized, and thanked me for being so kind. 
Did they make a couple of mistakes and give the drive thru people my order and vice-versa? Yes. 
Did they do everything they could to make it right? Absolutely. I'll definitely be back. And besides, their food is delicious! Kudos to Heaven for making a potentially angry situation into a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Love this place . Food is always fresh and hot . Drive thru moves quickly . Store is clean and everyone is super friendly . 
This is definitely a place to go to anytime ."}
{"text":"These are my favorite burgers right now! Great flavor in every bite, and the shoestring fries are a great addition and stay hot throughout the whole meal.

Don't forget to save room for dessert! I like to get the Turtle Sundae with butterscotch..so good!
Finding a seat can be a problem at times, but that's to be expected when the burgers are hat good!"}
{"text":"Great burgers...amazing onion rings..excellent service. 
I was being indecisive and changed my mind 3x at drive thru...as I apologized the employ said change your mind as many times as you like...refreshingly sweet attitude. Drive up to get my Order and the employ reached her hand out to shake mine and said nice to meet you my name is heaven ...I have never had a drive thru attendant shake my hand and introduce herself. And then after all that which was a great experience ....the manager gave me a comp chocolate custard...which was delish! ...crazy cool fast food joint. If you havent been...GO 
Another bonus...there is no tip jar at the drive thru window (-:"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Literally had the rudest interaction with their staff. It was to the point where I seriously wanted to get out my car and do something about it that instance. Will never come back here or advise anyone to come here."}

{"text":"I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service is an easy 5/5. I have been to this location frequently, sometimes with young children. The staff is especially patient & amazing with the kids!!  The food is always fresh, and fast. The custard is great-especially love the new funnel cake sundae.
Also, I wanted to mention I observed 2 different staff members in the restroom and they did a very thorough hand washing. That was nice to see based on things I've observed at other restaurants..."}
{"text":"Excellent. Food is stellar!! If you have to wait any extra time, you'll get a coupon for next time. Incredible management too."}
{"text":"Best hamburger & ice cream place ever . They have delicious cheese hamburgers and ice cream, they do serve you with fries with a drink also. I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"This was a different experience. I can't say I have ever had a burger like the one I had here. I can't say I ever saw one that looked like it either. The burger didn't look appetizing when I first opened it. The burger just looks different. I went with the hatch green chili burger. It had grilled hatch chilies, grilled onions, mustard and cheese. The burger tasted pretty good. The grilled chilies and onions tasted nice together. My wife had a chili cheese dog and we split an order of chili cheese fries. I took a bite of the chili dog and liked it. The chili cheese fries were just okay, it was more like chili and cheese soup with a few fries floating in it. 

The dude that took my order was nice and the place appeared clean. They have bathrooms but I didn't visit them.

There is a drive thru."}
{"text":"Oh my it has been a busy crazy hectic end of the year.  I am waiting for the new one to start.  I will start off saying I love this place.  The food is always good and the French fries are always yummy.  I wish the fries were a little bit longer, but they are still good.  This place is good.  I always get a double hamburger with out cheese and it is yummy."}
{"text":"No matter what branch I go to even know it's fast food it's not like fast food it's absolutely delicious and the shakes are amazing and handmade"}
{"text":"Went here for our weekly family Friday night dinner. It's another 50's style hamburger joint. It's a pretty original concept actually(sarcastic grin). I ordered the #6 California burger meal. It's a double cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The burger was very tasty and to me very similar to in n' out. My wife mentioned that this place reminded her of steak and shake. Same vibe and the food taste similar. There fries weren't bad and you get a huge amount per meal. Good size drinks but stay away from the brewed ice teas. I couldn't taste the tea, it was just water really. This will be another one of our go to places. They also have a drive thru which is a big plus. I almost forgot to mention that most of the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The good: the food is very good, the frozen custard is incredible. The employees are always friendly and professional.
The bad: the drive thru is so slow..... Plan on being a while, even if you are the only car there.
The bottom line: great family dining at a reasonable price..... Just save fuel and go inside."}
{"text":"Are you f'in kidding me. We ordered 2 mini ice cream sundaes and I have to pull around front and wait. As I write this, I have been waiting for 15 minutes plus. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"First time at Freddy's, not sure if I'll return mainly because of price point.  Went through drive-thru, and you know what they say about drive-thru.  Oops.  They almost got it right - just the California burger was opposite of what we ordered (everything, no onion).  Darn!  They read the order back correctly too, so I had such high hopes.

The patty melt was good, and I enjoyed the super skinny fries.  Ice tea seemed fresh as well.  Kids ordered a mini sundae and concrete.  My husband kept announcing the price with surprise each time we added another item - it really was quite funny.  In the end, after three hamburger meals, a chicken tender meal (regular), and two mini desserts we spent $43.  I guess that's a bit higher than most other fast food joints.  What surprised me was the price of the mini desserts ($3.50 each) - guess I don't get out much.

All in all, not bad but not great.  Have to say I do like being able to get a patty melt in the drive-thru.  Ok, maybe I'll go back for another patty melt someday."}
{"text":"Cool another burger joint! That sells custard to boot!! It's what distinguishes this Midwest franchise from I&O, S&S and 5G's.

Ambiance - Whole area surrounding Freddy's looks new, from the repaved blacktop in the parking lot to the modern stylized 50's diner interior of the building which used to house Fazolis. The dining area is pretty spacious,airy,open ceilings. There is also a drive thru, didnt see any cars go thru during my visit. So FYI there is drive-thru service Yelpers. BTW the address is listed wrong..should be 9809 (see my photo) 

Service - Hard workers!!! Minute you walk into the place you are greeted by smiling faces eager to help you. In fact one of the employees saw us walking up from the parking lot and opened the door and greeted us. For being so new it was nice to see staff was confident when giving descriptions of their menu items. You place, pay and pick up your order at the counter when your number is called. Our wait time was less than 3 minutes.  Tables were cleaned up pretty quick.  Eagle eyed workers also came around and continuely cleared our table as soon as dirty napkin,empty straw wrapper hit the table...no kidding! 

Food -  Ordered their Orig Freddy's Dbl Steakburger which was their plain burger just pickles are on it..cheese was xtra.   If you want the lettuce, tomatoes whole bit upgrade to the Cali Burger . We also got Chili Cheese fries  to share and the Mr. got the Triple burger + a hot dog combo.  Our order came to $20 for all  food and drinks! 
 Everything was cooked to order,  so food was still hot when we sat down to eat.

The burger patties are pretty lean, no greasy oozing out mess here. They are smashed thin so the texture of the edges were pretty  brown & crisp on the outer part and cooked well done inside.  They're evenly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic.(that's what my tastes buds detected)  The bun was buttered and toasted. If you're a big eater the portions might be small for you, but it was perfect for me, it satisfied my red meat craving and  I didnt feel guilty \"super sizing\" it to a double burger.

The fries were the shoestring variety, still hot and still crisp with all the chili and velveta like cheese poured on it.  Their chili is a tad salty for my taste.  Mr. B said the hot dog was okay, I thought the buttered Texas toast was a different and cool take for a hot dog bun.  

The custard I ordered was a Vanilla concrete, similar to DQBlizzard. I dont get why it's called a \"concrete\" though, I was thinking it was going to be served up as brick..lol  The custard concrete is like a real thick ice cream but more dense, creamier..and felt very  rich & fattening ..the mixin I chose was caramel.  The custard was good but I only had a few spoonfuls since I was stuffed as it was.(so note.. order it to go next time) .  

Overall we enjoyed our meal, food was good, service great! I will probably choose this place over 5G's for my go to fast food burger joint when in the area because the prices are more reasonable and Freddy's got the custard!!"}
{"text":"Freddy's on Warm Springs Road doesn't disappoint! They may have a few fuck ups but the we can easily remove them ourselves.


Freddy's and In-N-Out are our top two places for a great quick bite. No matter what hour you go, you great fresh 'fast food' that's hot and ready! I love going during their 3-9pm hours via drive thru because their staff does exceptional work.

My guilty pleasure is a vanilla concrete with peanut butter, cherries and whip cream along with their double cheese burger meal and a Sprite. Any lady with period pains or starting to PMS it's heavenly!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food burger place in Henderson. I love the patty melts, and the cheeseburger are also excellent. The onion rings are amazing! I am not a fan of the fries- they are too shoestring for my taste."}
{"text":"I'm normally not into sweets, but I must say the Hawaiian Sundae that I ordered hit the spot. It was just what I was looking for to cool me down from this heat! It wasn't too sweet at all compared to other sundaes at other places.  This sundae consists of vanilla ice cream, pineapple cubes, shredded coconuts, macadamia nuts, whip cream, topped with a cherry! The small was a good size for me!

The second sundae I tried was the Dirt and Worm Sundae. It had crushed Oreos, gummy worms, whip cream, topped with a cherry.  It was also good, but you got to watch out with the Oreos getting stuck between your teeth.  

Another sundae I tried was the Turtle Caramel Sundae and that one was waaaay too sweet for me. I felt like I was going to get a cavity after eating a few scoops.  For all you caramel and Pecan lovers out there, you would probably love this one!"}
{"text":"Freddy's has a really great environment and the food is almost always good. There have been a few visits where my food was waaaay too salty.. but the fries are my favorite! The price is a little expensive for what it is and it would be nice if they had a combo option that includes the dessert at a cheaper rate. Other than that, it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing extraordinary that would make me rush back. The guy at the counter asked if it was our first time at the restaurant, to which we replied that it was. He was upbeat and very friendly while he explained the concept and different menu offerings. I opted for the California burger with cheese fries. The burger was very bland. The cheese on the fries was the cheap melted cheddar cheese that reminded me of old high school cafeteria lunch cheese. I wouldn't opt for this place again. The price was higher than average burger joint like In N Out. The stars are mainly for the friendly employee and clean/spacious restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our First time trying freddys.... steakburgers and chicken sandwich were made fresh, shoestring fries and a drink (we split a sundae just to try their ice cream).... the staff is friendly (manager even took a tour around to make sure every guest was satisfied).... very clean and organized establishment.... we would recommend you try this place out for yourself...."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The cheese burgers are tasty, custard (concrete's) are awesome and their french fries w/fry sauce **yes i said fry sauce** are DELICIOUS! 

Food - 4 stars
Service - 5 stars
Desserts - 4 stars

If you are in the area and are looking for a quick yummy burger than go no further. 

(Tis the season for Pumpkin Pie......Freddy's has an out of this world Pumpkin Pie Concrete that i would highly recommend.)"}
{"text":"I adore their burgers. It's the frilly, crispy edges they have - lacey bits of beefy goodness! Their seasoned shoestring fries are fantastic too, if you happen to get a fresh batch. 

I'm only dinging them a couple of stars because service can be slow, and their frozen custard is just OK. Admittedly, I was spoiled by a fantastic small custard shop in my old East coast neighborhood. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This location is not up to par. My first experience at Freddy's was traveling from VA to NC, after stopping in Burlington and finding Freddy's, I loved it! I was lucky when they put one up in Rock Hill, so every once and a while (on cheat day), I run over for my Freddy's fix. I was in the Indian Land area this Friday night and saw Freddy's. I was super excited to grab a delicious burger. Let me just say....the experience here is not great! The staff in Rock Hill have it down to a science and are the most friendly people I've ever met! In Indian Land...not so much. Upon entering, I ran to the rest room and after I walked in, a male worker opens the door and yells \"hey, can you check that trash can for me and let me know if it's full?\" Ummmm...Can you let me go pee please?! Yikes! Then, I go up to order my burger (still super excited) and the girl had no clue. I can tell this location just opened and there's kinks but c'mon now! She charged cheese to my burger, after I explained more than twice that I didn't want cheese. So I mention this again and point out there's a small price difference. She calls another worker over and this girl says \"nah you're gonna have to cancel the order and re-enter it\", so the cashier then swiped my card (she grabbed it from my hand as I was telling her about the change for a third-fourth time) and prints my receipt saying \"go over to the kitchen counter and yell back to them that you don't want cheese on it and give them your order number\"......sooooo, I guess we forgot about the price difference? Did you want me to go back and put my burger together too? The male manager walking around just looked pissed and disgusted at the same time. Never once did he smile or greet anyone while walking around. This is a change compared to Burlington and Rock Hill locations where the managers greet you, walk around and see if anyone needs anything, and strike up conversations to get to know their customer base. 

I am a fan of Freddy's and I WILL return to the Rock Hill location and Burlington if I'm ever traveling but WILL NOT return to the Indian Land location. Their issues isn't just lack of training...it's lack of customer service, lack of personality and laziness. I totally understand the food service industry (was in it for a decade) and the stress it brings...but you can't teach basic skills such as customer service, friendliness and attentiveness. This location needs to \"clean house\" and try again!"}
{"text":"Very unique burger. For fast food in out is great and my favorite. But this is a close second. Fries are thin and crispy and the dipping sauce is killer. The wait staff is friendly and proficient   Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great burger and even better seasoned fries and special dipping sauce for the fries.  The frozen custard is good and a must have if stopping in.  Personally I like the \"other\" chain's frozen custard better."}
{"text":"They are some what friendly but they are the slowest Freddie's in the valley. They seemed to forget half of the food, oh it was in the bag, it's just normally me and my other half can split a chili cheese fry and  patty melt and be full and happy this was like half the portion we have ever received at other locations! Out melt was ok... I was underwhelmed by the experience, unfortunately I can't say I would recommend this location to satisfy your Freddy's needs!"}
{"text":"Eh. Just, eh.  Freddy's is trying soooo hard to be Steak and Shake, from the 50's motif and furniture, the black, white, and red color scheme, the nostalgia on the walls, and menu.

It's counter service instead of being waited on by a server.  Service speed wasn't fast but not terrible.  Its real short coming is the burger.  I don't need to be able to read through the party, meaning it doesn't have to be so thin.  It gets burned that way.  Had two burgers and each was burned.  They carry Pepsi products (vomit).  It is clean but that may be due to its newness.

I will stick to Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"Service is really good. Lots of choices and they are very accommodating - you can customize.  They will also lettuce-wrap your burgers if you are trying to cut the carbs.  Shakes and custard are awesome, and the burgers are really good, too."}
{"text":"Think of it as an over priced steak n shake with better service.

The food wasn't bad. I order the no. 1 which was a double chz burger, fries and drink, but it was $8.23.  In my opinion it wasn't worth it.  The burger was thin and crisp but the bun was noticeably soggy.  The fries were shoestring fries and they were very fresh. 

The customer service was on par with chicfila.  I was impressed & it was very clean on the inside. I did not get the custard they are famous for.  The combo itself was more than enough.  

I can say I've tried it now. But for what it is, I doubt I'll return when steak n shake is across the street and half the price."}
{"text":"It's a steak burger so it's a bit different then a normal burger. It's thinner but pack with great flavor. The hotdogs & onion rings are both great as well. But the real difference here is the service. Awesome customer service!!"}
{"text":"Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers has a drive thru! That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.

I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.

Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now). Yum!"}
{"text":"Best steak burger place ever!! Go there get buger and ice cream is custard but so good the people there are so friendly and the food is really good"}
{"text":"I like the food but this last time I was here the place seemed a bit on the dirty side. The pickup counter looked as if hadn't been wiped down for at least a few hours and seemed to have a greasy film on it. The floor looked the same way. The food itself isn't bad but I'm not sure if I'd return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I relied on yelp to help me decide where I would eat lunch today and Freddys seem to be top of the list so we tried it and I am more than satisfied with not only the grill chicken breast sandwich we had but also the medium strawberry concrete shake that they offered. And the workers at the counter was more than helpful & Considerate & on top of all the good stuff, they have free Wi-Fi here and it works. Prices are $1 good. Great job Freddy's."}
{"text":"I love frozen custard and this place is no exception!  Very tasty custard with lots of different toppings. Loss of star because I think their prices are high and the food is just OK. I do not like their shoe string fries. Onion rings are huge and greasy."}
{"text":"Place was fire!! I love the burgers, the way they cook the patties are awesome! I'm from Cali and in & out is my comfort food, but these burgers will be my new home food! And the fries...... psssh hella good"}
{"text":"Got a Chicago dog and a regular sized \"concrete,\" which is essentially soft serve ice cream  in a cup. Hot dog was not even quite as good as the gas station nearby. The \"concrete\" was fairly good. But, it came out to over $10. Which could have gotten me all you can eat steak a mile down the road. 

Definitely overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"These burgers were really good! Way better than your typical fast-food burger. They have thin shoe-string fries which aren't my  favorite, but they had different seasonings for them and FRY SAUCE! I haven't found many places in town that have fry sauce. Their custard shakes are also delicious. Perfect place to go if you want a good burger and a milkshake."}
{"text":"Love this place, Come here usually late night summer when I want to have something cold! I love their turtle sundaes"}
{"text":"Never heard of it and friends took me there.  Liked the joint. had a 50's feel.  The hatch chili burger was fantastic but didn't care for shoestring fries.  Friendly people and was clean.  Will go back but there's only one in the valley."}
{"text":"The deserts are delicious. This is my second time here in two days. Nothing skimpy about it. For the money compared to the other custard places I think this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Yuck!! The place was dirty. Both the floors and tables were gross. and there were bugs crawling on my feet and legs and when I told my husband what the bugs looked like..he said \"like those crawling on the Windows. :(  not going here again. Yuck!! I should have taken a picture of the bugs crawling on the Windows. Saw at least 50 black beetle looking things. Killed the 4 that were crawling on me. I did tell the manager who said..we have had extermination done."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Freddy's custard. It's the best! Make sure you get the mini size, they are regular size in the real world. I would highly recommend the turtle sundae. Loss of star because I am not a fan of their regular food, always just come for dessert. This place is right across from Teakwoods, go there for dinner and come here for dessert :-)"}
{"text":"I can only review the custard. But, it was fantastic! So smooth and creamy. We got the peanut butter cup sundae and the Hawaiian. I love fruit and would normally say the \"anything with strawberry\" was my favorite, but the peanut butter cup sundae that had bananas in it was definitely the winner. Bought these two for our family of four. Little guy refused any, so the elder and my hubby and I spooned them down. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Onion rings and fries were the best part of this meal.
Hotdogs were kind of over cooked or really crunchy.
Fish was stuck together while frying and mushy as well as oily."}
{"text":"I found the perfect Freddy's burger - a regular single patty with everything, but add lettuce and green chilies.  Wow, it melts in your mouth!  Some of the best burgers I have ever had.  Fries are very good, but IMO, not as good as McDonald's (which are my all time favorite when they are piping hot).  Prices are very reasonable and the service is \"over the top\"."}
{"text":"The food was very good but in all honesty, a little pricey. The burgers and the fries are exactly like Steak and Shake but a little more expensive."}
{"text":"When I rolled up to this Freddy's the parking lot was empty and I couldn't see anyone inside. I figured - location, location, location and this poor little buddy went down because it didn't have a good location or something. I stammered in anyways and to my dismay they were indeed open - the workers all kind of looked like they were bored out of their mind. I was thinking, maybe they are indeed hurting for business.

I ordered the #1 and it was delicious. Their fries were little shoe-strings that were browned just right. Perfect. I generally like the opposite end of the fry spectrum - big meaty potato wedges, but these were really, really good. I was impressed.

The burger was equally good. I am a big fan of \"old school\" hamburgers that feel like they were made out of raw meat and thrown on a grill. These may have not been made out of raw meat, but they seemed like it. I will warn you though, even the double patty deal was about the same thickness as a single 1/4lb patty elsewhere. So yes, these patties are thin, almost crumbly. So if you're hungry you might want to order a second or just really concentrate on the fries (which they seemed to give a lot of). This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle. I love pickles so they won my heart on that front.

I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left. how bad could it possibly be? I already love ice-cream, gelato, fro-yo, and shaved ice so how could I not like frozen custard? Well, it too was a win. I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full. We got the Chocolate Brownie Delight.

On a total random note I really liked the \"fry sauce\" which I think was just ketchup and mayo mixed. I reminded me of the middle-school days when we would mix up the two and eat it on everything on our plate.

I'll give this place a 4.5/5. It was good but I really wished that the fries were a little more beefy. I felt like I had to go grabbing 300 times to eat my portion and I'd rather be lazy and rach 15 times and eat the same amount. LOL."}
{"text":"Average burger, average toppings, free refills on drinks. This is a similar burger to Culver's. Everything toppings = 2 pickle slices, a smear of yellow mustard, a couple onion rings, and some melted butter on a toasted bun. Somewhat boring actually and nearly identical to Culver's. I think the burger is somewhat overpriced based on it's perceived value.

Place your order and sit at the table, wait for your order number to be called. Or you can sit forever in the drive thru since they dont pre-cook burgers.

Their fries are 100% worth missing. Tiny stringy oily fries, about the worst I've had, worse than In & Out fries.

Location is right out in front of Winco just off Power Rd, just south of Southern Ave.

Hours are roughly 10-10."}
{"text":"Must have passed this place a hundred times driving up Eastern and always wanted to try it. My wife was in the mood for a burger so we were on the way to Red Robin when we saw Freddys across the street. Good time to try the place. She got the double burger and I opted for the chicken breast.
This is really a fast food place (along the lines of a McDonalds) rather than a sit down (like Red Robin). The double burger had two really thin paddies (where's the beef??) and a bland bun. Very unexciting. She got onion rings with it. Now those were tasty. My chicken breast sandwich was OK. Big piece of chicken, very bland bun. Came with a big side of fries. The fries were really good. Skinny fries, crispy, and not too salty. Yummm.
Since custard is in the name, I wasn't gonna leave without trying one. Got a cup of concrete. Now that was really good. I'm not running back for a burger or a chicken sandwich, but I will certainly return for a custard dessert!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service here.  A tad pricey but the food is great.  Better than In N Out and Fatburger, in my opinion."}
{"text":"How nice for people on this side of the valley to have a Freddy's location.  This restaurant is in a nicely remodeled stand-alone building.  IMHO, it's a welcome addition to the other chain eateries and fast food drive-thrus in this shopping complex at the southeast corner of Decatur & Charleston. Just look for the bright red signage and accents!

My recent visit was during the typical lunch time zone and my drive-thru order was taken promptly, with friendly service at the speaker and window. I appreciated that they moved that drive-thru line quickly, it did not seem at all to be a long wait.

In hindsight, I should have tried the menu items that Freddy's is known for--like its steakburgers or frozen custard.  But their basic hot dog combo drew my attention. Am glad I went with that selection as the all-beef hot dog was served hot off the grill in a split-top bun that was buttery toasted on the sides, with the dog drizzled in just the right amount of mustard. The combo came with a drink and crunchy shoestring potato fries, crispy on the outside with a light potato interior.  Mmmm, very tasty and thankfully, no resemblance to the canned shoestring fries that our mom used to buy.

I was happy enough with this experience that I think there will be another visit.  And next time, I'll try one of their burgers and if there's room, might even order a frozen custard dessert.  I feel an updated review coming on soon."}
{"text":"My easiest description... Dairy Queen meets In&Out Burger.
However, Freddy's has earned their own category.

The frozen custard alone is worth the trip! 
There is nothing that comes close to the richness and creamy texture of their frozen treats.
The shakes come with with a straw big enough to launch a cashew through (when you are done drinking).

PLUS, they have hot dogs and Philly steak sandwiches too. 
If you order a burger, make sure to get a double or triple. 
The single patty burgers are great for the little ones.

Did I mention that the frozen custard alone is worth the trip???
If you have a soft serve ice cream fetish, this is your place!
Caution! This place IS addictive."}
{"text":"These burgers are kinda like Smashburger in that they seem smashed and cooked fast. The fries are very thin. The ketchup portion cups are crazy small.

The burgers are good and you have lots of optional add-ons. The fries are also good. 
Customer service was very good, I'd say these folks care!!"}
{"text":"I tried Freddy's yesterday when I saw it was open and I was not disappointed.  I got the double California burger (cause I knew the burgers were thin) and I think that was a good choice, cause it was just the right size.  It was seasoned just right and very tasty.  I got fries and they offered me ketchup or fry sauce and I said \"oh, I'll try the fry sauce\".  LOVED it, could eat it on a flip flop.  The fries are very thin so not my favorite but they were good, especially slathered in fry sauce :). I can't wait to go back to try a dessert.  I saw one that was vanilla custard with peanut butter cups and banana that was calling my name."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews here. We had a really great experience. Food was really good and so was the custard. I had the original double with cheese fries. My son had a grilled cheese. The place looks bee and clean. Fast service. This was our 1st time and we will be back for sure. You should get the double because the patties are really thin."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill. We used to love going here. A week ago or so, they forgot one of my kids food and gave us 1 fry sauce to split between 6 people. Today they didnt give us any fry sauce and the fries tasted like they were last nights leftovers."}
{"text":"Very good.... I had been craving good chili cheese fries for a long time and these were very delicious.  They are enough to share. ..trust me! The burgers are full of flavor and very good all around!"}
{"text":"Yum yum. 
Kind of like a hybrid between in n out and Baskin-Robbins. The burgers were delicious and the ice cream was really good. 
Win-win"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always delicious.  I love the shoestring fries and the fry sauce.  If I could drink it I would, ok not really but its yummy. The hamburgers are always cooked to perfection, the fries are always hot and we get our food quick.  With a family of 5 that is always a plus!  The staff is always friendly and very helpful.  They will clear your trays when you are done.  The custard is delicious.  I like the chocolate, it is rich and creamy. This is our families go to burger place!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I went through the drive thru thinking it would be another greasy burger. WRONG...its was a dry crispy flatted out peice of salty road kill. Try the Chicago dog Yummy!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy!! I wouldn't go if you were on a diet but it's a great place to eat when you want something tasty!  The people were super friendly and the manager was working with his people, which was nice to see.  They did get one item wrong on our order but quickly corrected it and were very apologetic, hey we are all human right?!  We will be going back!"}
{"text":"They take forever every time I go through the drive-thru and they got my order wrong several times and the girl at the window was rude. I'm not coming to this location any more. Worst fast food service I've ever had and that's saying something. Fast food places are supposed to get you in and out in a snap and this place fails miserably each time."}
{"text":"I love Freddys. Friendly staff. Fast service. Clean facility. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah they also have some of the best burgers in town. Five star is for all of the above plus their prices. Considering how great the experience is the price is good. If you're looking for a good restaurant with reasonable prices then look no further. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Really, REALLY long 20 minute wait in drive through line with only 2 cars ahead of me. I asked the girl at the window about the wait and she gave me a lame excuse that the car in front had ordered a triple stack burger which this joint serves......lame, lame! And there were at least 10 employees inside who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.....total lack of synergy. My patty melt was mangled and discombobulated inside the serving box and the fries were tasteless and almost stale. Won't go back unless management comps my next order."}
{"text":"Sad excuse for a Chicago dog. Tasteless fries that thus require the odd mayonnaise dipping crap...I lived in the Midwest 40 years and have never heard of fry sauce. And they use the pervasive evil styrofoam."}
{"text":"We tried Freddy's on vacation and were so delighted. The fried pickles are the best I've had. They are crunchy and still taste like pickles. The burgers are so yummy and have that great little fried edge."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great burgers and love the green chile! The custard is good, I like the turtle custard. I used to eat at Blake's lotaburger when in new mexico, and then switched to in n out, but Freddy's takes the cake!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries, great shakes. I ate here three times in on week. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Loved the green chile burger.  My daughter got a patty melt that she enjoyed and my son got chicken fingers, he liked. They actually forgot to put the chicken fingers in the bag and luckily didn't get too far to go back bit when i returned they apologized sincerely,  upgraded the order (no extra charge) and gave us a free pint of chocolate custard!  They made it right and we were all happy! Definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"Actually 4.5 stars. I ate there on a Thursday at approx. 11:30 a.m. It was maybe 3/4 full (and was full by the time I left). The counter help was polite and professional and the restaurant was clean. I had the patty melt combo w/fries. The food was hot and fresh. The  melt was very good and the fries were of the shoestring variety which I prefer. Recommended."}
{"text":"I usually do not review chain restaurants because they're a dime a dozen but Freddy's always seems to set itself above the competition. I recently made a visit at the drive through where my order was messed up. I called into the store and they were really kind and told me to come back into the store to make up for the mess up. Well needless to say it was 5 days after that visit when I came back and Craig who I believe it a manager took care of me. He was so kind to me which I greatly appreciate. He went out of his way to make sure I was satisfied and comped mine and my sisters meal. I frequent Freddy's because I feel like they're not looking at me as just money, but they treat you like family. This is not the first time I have had this treatment. They are a very kind and giving company with top notch people. I deeply appreciate the kindness from this company!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru of my life. Literally took 15 minutes to get my food that I couldn't even eat BC it took up so much of my lunch break I had to race back to work. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Fun, soda shop feel. Good food. Great music. Friendly service. Shoestring fries. Fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"Hubby invited me last night for an ice cream,  end up getting 2 sundaes  there were absolutely delicious!  Fast service and awesome taste.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I came to Freddys the first time today. I have lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and have driven by this location multiple times, just never stopped. I read an article where they are known for good hamburgers, so here I am. 

I entered and read the menu. The cashier was nice and pleasant. After my order I sat down. All condiments were stocked, place was pretty clean except for a couple of tables. 

My burger was very good. Reminded me a bit like steak and shake. The fries are shoestring which I personally am not a fan of. They were hot and portion size was big. They were a bit salty.  I tried the jalapeno sauce which was good. 

Kitchen looked clean, bathrooms were clean too. All in all, great experience. I wanted to try a milkshake but was too full. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went and got two concrete's. One was a regular mint oreo and the other was a large oreo. The smaller sized mint concrete actually cost 70 cents more than the large concrete that inly was missing a pump of mint flavor . A little odd, you would think they'd be the same price or the regular size would still be cheaper.

It looks like they barely put any oreo topping in the $5 large concrete. The larger size should have more topping in it. Almost seems they put the same amount as in the regular which did seem to have the right amount of oreo. Mint stuck on bottom. Tip add some custard first then mint then more custard. Would turn out better. 

Overall it was decent but expensive for the mistakes made. Total bill for two ice creams was $11.51 a little high. May or may not go back..."}
{"text":"Kind of pricey for a burger but not bad. I've never had a steak burger before and it was pretty tasty. I especially enjoyed the crispy ends of the burger. The fries are really thin, not really my thing but they weren't bad. Clean in the eating area and condiment area. Next time I'm trying one of the ice cream sandwiches made out of nutter butters!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and great food . Always fresh and close by my house. The chicken fingers are amazing good."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was delicious. I recommend it for the whole family. The burgers were fresh and seasoned well. The chicken tenders my daughter had were tasty. The custards were amazing as well. Great place for a burger friendly service and a great meal. Can't beat that"}
{"text":"Freddy's is a great find!!!!!! 
It wasn't crowded when we went, the food was great, the kids that work there were alllll polite & respectful. They didn't seem like it was a chore for them to actually work!!!!!

Ended my meal with Pumpkin frozen concrete, which I did forget inside & the cashier ran it to me outside !!!! That was delish !!!!! My hubby got a jalapeno type burger, he really liked it.... 
Make the trip, it'll be worth your time !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good all around place for pleasure (bad) eating. You got your burgers, fries and then custard all in one spot.

Burgers are tasty and have the nice flattop type char. Meat is super thin so you gotta do a double at minimum and the triple is really just about a normal double. But the flavor of the burgers are very good with the normal pickle/onion (grilled or fresh) lettuce and tomato toppings (depending on which type of burger you choose).

Fries are the skinny shoestring type fries which are actually really good and crispy. They are also great as chili fries as well. They have a nice seasoned salt you can put on them which adds extra flavor. They also have fry sauce (mayo/ketchup kinda deal) which is good.

Then come the custard which is really good. Chocolate or vanilla in all the variety you want: cones, sundaes, concretes etc. The turtle sundae is awesome.

Fast food type joint kinda fashioned in the old diner style."}
{"text":"Everything in this place is great. Reminds me of shake shack but even better. Amazing custard ice cream. Very friendly staff as well. You should try this place you will not be disappointed in any way."}
{"text":"Just opened today...came about 8pm and no one was there and got our food in 5 minutes. I have been stopping at Freddy's in Victorville for years and is one of my favorites for burgers.

All the food was served hot and looked perfect."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open since they started construction on it last year. It's the first shop to open in Marley Park Square and we hope this will help everyone else follow suit and fill the empty space. 

We went to Freddy's during their opening night. It was very busy, as expected, but they handled the lines well. We love their skinny fries! Their burgers are just okay. I'm not sure what's missing from it...I may have just ordered the wrong one. Mine didn't come with lettuce or tomatoes, so I'll be sure to look at my options better next time.

The owner came by and asked us how we were doing which was nice. The place is new and poppin'! We're glad they're finally here."}
{"text":"Great food and desserts! The shoestring fries are something different than your usual cut of fries. Burger was cooked just right and tasted great! Nice place to take your family for lunch! Will definitely come back for a second and third run. Customer service was great and overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Cracker jack concrete is really good. Went through the drive thru so by the time I got home in this heat it was half melted. No problem I used a straw and spoon. I also have to say every time we have come here the food has been great from the fish, chicken and burgers to the custard. Love the fries and that fry sauce they give you OMG! the best to me its better than ranch :) The employees have always been nice and helpful and they even gave us extra straws to take home to our cat who LOVES to play with them!!!
They are open 7 days a week from 10:30 am to 10 or 11 pm.
Give it a try I think you will be happy."}
{"text":"Did they change management? It's been a while since I've been here and it's always been good. I went today around 5pm and the Freddy's original tasted good but wasn't very hot. The french fries were awful. They were cold and rubbery. How long were they sitting there before they gave them to me?? Of course I went thru the drive-thru so I was already home when it was discovered. I couldn't eat the fries, they went in the garbage. Very upset."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not great.

They have a lot to offer and a lot of potential, but there could be some improvements.  I had their cheese burger which was good, but not anything special necessarily. Reminded me of In-n-out because they also have their own sauce. If someone I'm with wants to eat there I'd have no problem with that, but I don't think I'll necessarily go back just for myself.

Something to note if you do go: they have a horrible line area.  We got lucky and seemed to go during a lull, but about 3 minutes after we got there the line got incredibly long and it was uncomfortable because people didn't know where to stand, it was kind of funny.  Also, there are WAAAYYY too many workers walking around and standing idly.  It made it super awkward when my family and I were trying to eat and every few minutes someone asked us how our meal is..not gonna lie but in 3 minutes nothing is going to change from our answer haha And at that point we were kind of wondering if they're going to have that many workers why don't they bring us our food instead of calling numbers and we go up and get it? Just a thought."}
{"text":"We had our very first trip to Freddy's 1 week ago, on our way to Great Wolfe Lodge. I cannot say enough good things about our experience.. The burgers, fries, fry sauce, and frozen custard were all awesome! Equally as good as the food, was the customer service. In a world where everything and everyone is rushed, the staff at Freddy's took the time to make us all feel important and welcomed. The manager on duty, Avery, was exceptional! 
We will definitely be visiting Freddy's again soon."}
{"text":"Burgers, Hot Dogs and fries... Oh my! Love this place and the service is always friendly! Great for taking the kids."}
{"text":"We came in to try it the ice cream is great the customer service is on point and the food looks good it's always busy in here you can say that's a good thing very clean and me net"}
{"text":"People love my fast food reviews, so here is another at a fairly new establishment in the far reaches of the valley. I'm not sure that at $3.19 for a single burger, we can call it fast food, but it has a drive through, so it qualifies. My only purchase was the single steakburger on what seemed to be a very buttered bun. The patty was thinner than a wafer and was hand formed and a tad on the greasy side and not really comparable to any other fast food burger. It falls below In and Out, when they are having a good day and basically in its own category. Nothing wrong with this place on occasion and the burger is dressed with a few slices of onion and sliced pickles.

UPDATE: Grilled Chicken Sandwich belongs in nastyville. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Needed something quick and there was Freddy's. The main issue here is the prices. The burgers are wafer thin and well done which is what I enjoy, but the lowest priced burger is about 4 bucks with tax. A double will almost cost you 6 bucks without any soda or fries. I was lured inside by the green chili poster and I did get that burger as a single which apparently adds another dollar to the cost. The burger was great as the bun was soft and the green chili and grilled onions and Freddy's sauce all melded together for a nice taste. The employees seem nice and I would return if craving one of these burgers. I think the green chili option is only temporary though."}
{"text":"This area can't get nothing good!

Freddys finally opened and we hit up the drive thru.  The drive thru took FORever.  We only ordered a burger combo with a root beer float, fish n chips, and a chili dog.

There were about 4 adolescent girls standing in the drive thru window.  Literally just standing there staring at the monitor.  The window must be on a motion sensor because it kept opening and closing while we were waiting there forever.  One of the teens said to the other \"What is taking so long?\"  TELL me about it. Why don't two of you go help the boys I can see struggling in the back to make food.  

Finally the food comes up.  I asked if there were vinegar and tartar sauce for the fish n chips.  She said yes and handed it to me.  I check the bag and nope no sauce.  She went back to get some taking even more of my time.  She comes back with one tiny packet of vinegar and one tiny packet of tartar sauce.  Really?  I have 4 pieces of fish here!  Rather than wait longer and have her slowly walk back over there I cut my losses and drove off.

Got home and the fries were cold and stale.  I rationed the vinegar and tartar sauce over the four pieces of fish like I was Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  

The chili dog was a sloppy mess and not good.  Four bucks for some chili, a bun, and a hot dog doesn't go a long way apparently in the quality department.

The root beer float was excellent and so was the cheeseburger.  I guess I'd say to stick to that.  What a nightmare the food options are over here.  All this money and we can't afford quality food.  If someone were to open a good place around here they would make a killing."}
{"text":"Thanks to Beth G.'s review today we remembered that we'd been here once before and liked it, so we returned for dinner tonight. 

I had a California steakburger. What makes it \"California\"? Classic burger veggies? Strange. It was tasty, though. The beef was well-seasoned and crispy on the thin outer edges. Yummy. Hubby had the patty melt on another Yelper's recommendation, but he found the heavily seeded rye \"distracting.\" Both came with a vat of shoestring fries. Delicious and crispy, but frankly, way too much.

We both got some custard- we drove 20 miles to get here, so we might as well. I had a regular sized Hawaiian sundae and Hubby had a vanilla custard with peanut butter mix-in. Very smooth and peanut-buttery. Mine was also tasty, but huge- I would hate to see the large.

We'll make the trek to Freddy's again- there are so few places around here that are even close to Steak-n-Shake (Midwest fave)."}
{"text":"Huge fant, one of the rare places I will eat at that is fast food!
The burgers are great and actually taste and look like meat, the french fries or always crispy (even when you take them home from the drive thru) and the custard is simply amazing.  I went their once and waited for a prescription at Walgreen's and when one of the staff found out I was sick she gave me a free custard to go.  :)"}
{"text":"We were in the area and it was a pleasant surprise. Burgers are very tasty and reasonable prices. Kids has the fish and liked it, good flavor and filling with the fries (chips)... oh, and try their fry sauce is good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Has that diner vibe. The music is not too loud. The burgers are reminiscent of the food we used to eat in the good ole days. And the place is pretty dang clean. The workers are real friendly. Too friendly. Haha. My only gripe, although not a big one nor a deal-breaker, is that I'm not really a fan of matchstick fries.  I haven't tried the custards, so..."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here, so I only got to try a couple items. I had the patty melt which had melted Swiss cheese and grilled onions. The flavor was good and very filling. It came with shoestring fries and a drink. The fries were just okay but much better when dipped in the fry sauce.

My two girls joined me and they are eight. They didn't want a kids menu item but an adult meal which was a hotdog, burger, fries and a soda. To my surprise, they are all of it! The verdict was they both enjoyed the burger more than In and Out (not my opinion but theirs). One told me the hotdog was just like at home, so nothing special. One loved the fries and the other did not eat hers at all. 

It's a little bit of a drive for us and we only visit every once in a great while. We did skip dessert, so not sure how that is. Staff was friendly and fast. They also have fry sauce there to purchase if you like it."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, Freddy's is my overall favorite.

The burgers and hot dogs are better than most chains, and the matchstick-thin fries are quite good.

The frozen custard is quite good (but doesn't hold a candle to Seridan's in Vancover, WA), and Freddy's offers many different add-ins for making tasty concretes."}
{"text":"$2.59 for five onion rings kinda high since two were stuck together and gummy in the middle. This side item is not worth the price. Quality is not there we got a lettuce wrapped burger but it was dripping grease??? What's up with this burger joint.
Save your money, quality has gone down, not the same as in the past."}
{"text":"The burgers tastes like they're home cooked. Fries are crisp and delicious. They're special sauce for the fries kind of reminds of of Canes special sauce except here there is two versions. A regular and a jalapeños flavor which I love. The double patty melt on rye bread is my all time favorite here"}
{"text":"The burgers are really good with good choices. I really love their custard concretes. The store is always clean."}
{"text":"This location seems to have taken a dive downhill. It's still a-ok, but it's sloppier and less good. 

The best part is the concretes. You now have to specifically ask for whip cream and only the first topping is free. And on my last trip, they didn't even mix it up. There was a bunch of heath toffee at the bottom with a bunch of vanilla custard sitting on top of it. Poor form. But at least they do have a slew of toppings and mix-ins to choose from. And the custard is tasty.

The Chicago hot dog is fine. It tastes like a hot dog. Nothing special. But it's a safe bet.

The fries are shoestring fries, which are enjoyable. They are usually always cooked just right too.

The burgers are ok. Kinda meh. I ordered a double California. The toppings were of poor quality. Wilting lettuce. Can pickles go bad? I think these were bad. Why is the tomato and onion so icky? Something went wrong here. And the California burger was supposed to include 1000 island dressing. There was absolutely none on the burger. There were, though, two sauce cups of some sort of bleh ketchup and mayo combo. So was that the 1000 island dressing? Or was it fry sauce? Was it both? Either way, it was a rip off.

So, in sum, the concretes are usually worth it (perhaps you now need to request they mix-in the mix-in?). But the non-dessert items aren't really worth it. And it's way overpriced. I spent $15 on a combo meal (burger, fries, and small drink) and small concrete. Not worth it."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES Vienna hot dogs and this is convenient and excellent service. Everyone at this location is always so pleasant. I hosted a World Series dinner with my family and they were able to accommodate a bunch of hot dogs and sides specially packed for everyone's needs. What place spends the time to do that?  Don't want a dog or sandwich - that's ok.  They'll make you a healthy grilled chicken salad (not on menu).  I will go here any day!"}
{"text":"Just wanted something cold and good. Hello frozen custard! where have you been hiding? Actually used to get frozen custard on the east side with the family when I was young and it brought back so many fond memories.
Great little place, fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"Not a big burger fan but this place is close to my work and I just needed to pick up something real quick one day so decided to check it out. I must say I was pretty impressed. The steak burgers are sooo tasty and they look homemade not your typical commercial patty. I went back and took a chance with the hot dog and it was good too. I love the grilled onion they put on it. 
I am not big on sweets but decided to try their frozen custard one time and I must say it was pretty damn good. Better than any ice cream I have ever tasted. I like the texture and consistency... It is very creamy and not too sweet. 
Oh and their fries... Can't get enough of them... I get them extra crispy and the seasoning they use it awesome. It's not just salt... 
Definitely a good place if you need a burger fix.
I always use the drive through but the service is decent. Nothing special for a drive through. They have never got my order wrong."}
{"text":"It's like Johnny Rockets and In n Out had an incredibly gifted love child! The burgers have the fresh, homemade quality you expect from a classic American staple. They have a variety of styles they serve their burgers, all loaded with high quality garnishes; I always add grilled onion to my California style! They have so much more than just burgers too- chicken sandwiches, hot dogs and more! 

But let's talk about the real pièce de résistance... their super skinny fries!! They are a showstopper when they're piping hot, complimented by their traditional or spicy fry sauce. I could eat a whole basket! 

They also have an amazing frozen custard selection with signature sundaes and concretes. The brownie sundae is sinfully divine! It's the most iconic and nostalgic old school soda shop restaurant I've been to in a while, especially for what is essentially a fast food/fast casual style place."}
{"text":"Don't go at the end of the night.  The hamburger,hot dog combo with fries was barely room temp.

Glad I didn't get the deep fried pickles I ordered and paid for. Cold deep fried pickles yuk.   Onions I didn't ask for on the hot dog.  Nothing I asked for was on the burger.  The Meat patty had bits of hard things in several bites."}
{"text":"I don't get the great reviews.  Steak 'n Shake is better and cheaper.  This place even charges for lettuce!  Lettuce - which should automatically come with burgers.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"No thank you greasy burger...I would much rather drive down the street to In & Out to grab a hamburger that doesn't give me a stomach ache and then up the block to Nielson's for 5 star frozen custard! 

I do have a friend who enjoys coming here, but I can't comprehend why...it is family friendly. It's another steak and shake to me, which also have me a stomach ache and made for a regretful evening. 

Bottom line: not worth the calories when there are so many better options within a 1/2 mike radius."}
{"text":"Kind of similar to steak and shake but definitely a five star steak sandwich. Also how do you say no to frozen custard. Both were delicious and I could stop shoving the small shoestring fries in my face. Had a bite of my moms hot dog and it was also very delicious. Chili on top of any hot dog just adds the right American touch. Also if you love thousand island then you'll love the \"Freddy's sauce\" and if you decide you love it and can't live without it.... good news for you, you can buy a bottle and take it home."}
{"text":"My new favorite place.. I have been waiting for a chili burger like in LA.  Must get the chili added to anything.   Shoestring fries are awesome... I prefer the original over the California burger. The bun is great.  Place is clean and customer service is excellent.  I will be back."}
{"text":"\"I tried this place again and the food was and services was very good. Glad I did!\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Employees always have a great attitude, special attention toward the customers. When I find a place with great fast food and great customer service. I'll rave about them. Freddy's you got a lifetime customer 
Plus their custards are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"So...I've been just sitting here...reading the reviews. And the 1star reviews? Gotta be kidding!  I think there was one comparing Freddy's to Fuddruckers. No comparison. Quality versus quantity. I'll go quality every time. 

I'm originally from St. Louis. The reviews comparing Freddy's to Steak 'n Shake are right on. It's that same burger that I used to watch being cooked (as a kid in the 60's.)  

But the really cool surprise was the frozen custard. Oh my gosh!  Again, the St. Louis tradition was Ted Drewes frozen custard. I used to wait in this  super huge long line to be served. They owned the market. And I've never had anything even close... Until now. Freddy's nailed that one too!!

Yeah... An easy 5 star review. (Wish I could give 6 stars as a bonus for the super friendly staff)"}
{"text":"Burger was very salty, fries are good.  Overall not impressed - will only go back to check out the desserts."}
{"text":"Best drive thru burger place ever! Even better than alot of sit down burger places! Loved Freddy's Original Double
 STEAK BURGERS. ... AMAZING!!!      The service was fast, friendly, and courteous.    Thanks Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Other reviewers are spot on in their description of Freddy's. Great burgers. Really good fries and chilli fries, hotdogs, and chicken.. And the frozen custard is awesome. Combine that with super-friendly staff and you've got a recipe for successes. They are head and shoulders above In n Out and 5 Guys. I don't know of another burger place in town better than Freddy's. We stop by this place nearly every time we're in the Silverado Ranch area and will continue to do so. If you're anywhere near Freddy's, you have to stop in and try it."}
{"text":"These guys offer a large fast casual burger menu and give you a ton of thin-cut fries when ordered. The burgers are reasonably big and full of flavor for the price (even the basic ones are real good), and that doesn't even get into their signature custards. I'm not a burger addict, but if I want one and I'm near a Freddy's, it's certainly near the top of my list."}
{"text":"THE BEST! And I'm soooo happy they opened one 2 minutes from me! We go there all the time. Delicious burgers, FANTASTIC hotdogs and I adore skinny fries! I love the salt they have to put on the fries, I know that's something small but I really appreciate the flavor it gives the fries. 

Custard is delicious. You can order it ''on hold'' which means you let them know when your done eating and they make your dessert. Fantastic! 

Customer service is usually good. The people working there are really friendly and the restaurant is always clean!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious food, incredible prices, and everyone in there was super friendly! The shoestring potatoes are really good, hot and crispy. My daughter loved the ''fry sauce''. The staff was so friendly, greeting us when we entered and left the place. They had a young man going around the dining room picking up your tray as soon as you were finished with it. All in all a very pleasant and delicious experience, without dropping $35 for a lunch! Two Double Steakburger combos and $15 out the door. Wish they had one closer to me. I would go back in a minute."}
{"text":"OK so I had to go see what all the hoopla was all about. Good burgers and really good fries that is what all the hoopla was about. There is a unique taste to both so it was an interesting meal. I like the atmosphere 9usually). Freddys sauce for the fries is good (. I think it is ketchup, mayo and pickle juice.). Anyway good enough to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, sister and I came to Freddy's last Saturday for a quick meal. It was our first time eating there and heard great things about it from the couple standing behind us in the Jcpennys line. The burger and shoe string fries were excellent! The meat and pickles were fresh and tasted great! I got a pumpkin slice concrete shake. Everything was fantastic. Coming back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Freddy's was terrific! My husband and I enjoyed everything.  We ordered from Mya who was so nice and great to talk to. She explained enthusiastically everything that we asked her about.  So we ordered 2 turtle sundaes, a steak bacon  burger  double cheese  and a chili  cheese fries. Oh wow everything was incredible!  Highly recommended! The bathrooms were clean and sinks were modern.  This location has been here since only January and it is packed! Certainly deserves all the great reviews and so does Mya! The custard was delicious the shoe string fries are amazing and the steak burger was terrific and cooked perfect!"}
{"text":"*This review is just for the custard* They have sundaes, shakes, malts and concretes all made with either chocolate or vanilla custard. You can build your own, or choose one of their specialty creations. They had a Dirt N' Worms one, and I was intrigued. Dirt N' Worms is fun take on a childhood favorite. The \"dirt' is crushed oreo cookies and the \"worms\" are gummy worms. I was driving and didn't want the mess of a sundae so I chose a concrete. A concrete is a sundae, but blended. For a small, it was a little over $5!! Ouch. I was really disappointed with what I received. There was hardly any \"dirt\", and only a few worms. The custard was vanilla and it was okay. I will be back to try the burgers and will update my review then."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times, and it usually is a nice treat( as we typically don't eat fast food often). Today I was out running some errands with my sister and 5 yr old. My little one was getting a little antsy, but had been extremely well behaved during our outing, so I thought I'd surprise him with a lemonade and small fry. I entered the drive thru and there were a few cars ahead of me and a few had pulled in shortly after I (so they were decently busy for a Saturday afternoon). I ordered a small fry, small lemonade, med soda and a large fried pickle (for my sister and I to share). We weren't in line long, and then we were at the window and had received our order(so far so good). I'm already headed towards the freeway when my sister pulls out my sons things and hand them to him and the pulls out the pickles, and that's when I realized they had charged me for a Large but gave me a half full small... now I've worked in service so I realize sometimes things happen when it's busy. That being said, it was extremely frustrating to not receive what I paid for. Sure it's only $5 In The grand scheme of things and we were fine sharing what we got but still extremely disappointing. Lesson learned. Check your bag before you leave the parking lot."}
{"text":"New to Freddy's & I love it. So far no issues with our orders or with customer service."}
{"text":"This location just opened today!  We've been looking forward to it.  Freddy's totally surpassed our expectations.  The California Steakburger was a gourmet burger, French fries were crisp and hot; and, we made room for desert!  The vanilla frozen custard with Butterfingers and whipped cream - OMG!  
Staff was well trained, courteous and pleasant!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in ages.  I took my husband back...he's not a burger person, but he really liked it too.  The burgers are thin and a bit crispy on the edges.  The fries were good, and the fry sauce was great. The turtleneck sundae was excellent. Now I'm having trouble NOT going there every day!"}
{"text":"I have been to Freddy's multiple times through the US and the food is always good and fresh. When I eat their burgers I don't feel like I have eaten a pound of meat and suffering afterwards."}
{"text":"THE BEST burger in any fast food joint hands down.

Best tasting
Best fresh cooked
Best seasoned
Best bun
Best service

All other chains - pay heed = this IS the future of fast - fresh food."}
{"text":"Ive driven by this place for years and finally decided to try it today. Im upset I didnt come in sooner! The burger I ordered was nothing crazy but I like the fact i can kind of build my own burger to my liking. The meat was tender And juicy. Grilled onions were grilled to perfection. I tried the chili cheese fries and they were delicious. I was also super happy to see that they have other options other then soda like sweet and unsweet teas. Personally I hate soda and usually have to drink water so this made a difference in my book. The thing that makes this fast food restaurant different is the atmosphere and friendliness of the crew members! Everyone appears happy and wanting to help clients. The establishment was fairly busy but it maintained clean for the most part. Will definitely be back mostly due to the great customer service we received from the crew! Thanks for an awesome first experience."}
{"text":"Customer service- 5 stars 
Food- 4 stars 
Prices- 2 stars 

Overall-3.6

I personally think the prices are too high for the quality of food. I paid roughly $12 dollars for a combo with a small milkshake... I understand that increases the price but I was better off going to cookout. The combo alone was $8."}
{"text":"Pros: excellent burgers and I love super skinny fries. ( even though you have to eat them really fast so they don't get cold ) cost for 2 with burgers, fries, onion rings, shake and mini sundae was about 23.00. Pretty good deal. I loved it but my husband preferred 5 guys but I am the one writing the review,   Cons: when we got there at 6 on a Friday night there were 10 or so people in front of us. So we were standing next to booths with people eating. Nothing like a butt in your face while dining ! That is poor restaurant design and should be fixed.  Smashburger does it as well as fuddruckers. So fix this part and you will have a successful place. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Not really frozen custard...more like just soft served ice cream =/ the burger is okay -- the California style burger is like a single cheeseburger from In N Out but I do like their fries...crispy and very thin. The menu is mostly ice cream and sundaes. 

Nothing very note worthy of this place...kinda cheap, has drive thru and big sit-in area and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a solid place for fast food and reminded me a lot of In-N-Out with a variety of frozen custards available. 

The burgers are shaped very thin but also are spread wide. The fries are thin cut. The appearance of the meal gives Freddy's a unique characteristic to remember it by.

The frozen custards come with a large variety of toppings, which is the main draw. However, if you are just looking for frozen custard and not the burgers, I would recommend venturing down the street to Nielson's for some frozen custard that will make your taste buds explode."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have had in years. Food was stale and dry.  Total chaos with the wait staff.  Totally overpriced.  I would not feed this junk to my dogs.  Would never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Freddy's SteakBurgers are the best. Always cooked perfect with that great fresh grilled fresh beef flavor.
French Fries are skinny style and super tasty especially with their special fry sauce.
Kids combos are a good bargain that includes a huge order of fries and a drink.
Service is consistent and the restaurants that I have visited are well maintained and always clean.
Great place for families and kids."}
{"text":"Staff is horrible. The food was great don't get me wrong but the completely forgot about my order after I got my shake. After a good 10 minuets of waiting I finally went up to them only to be told that they haven't even started my order. Not only that but the girl at the register was speaking so quietly I didn't even hear her say that the half and half shake meant half chocolate half vanilla. I'll try a different Freddy's because the employees in this location doesn't seem to care enough for their consumers"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for over a year now  Last week i ordered griled chicken breast on rye bread. They brought it to me on regular bun. I noticed human hair on the chicken. Thats gross! I could have a big seen but i didnt in front of his customers.
Today it was brezzy do i took my mccaw, into store. Ordered the same sandwich as last week again they could not get it right the first time. Then the mgr comes to my table and says my bird cannot be in the store. I told him i wanted my money back. And that i would never return to his resturant  . This owner discrimated against a 2.5 lb animal that brings smiles to countlesss people everyday. He wasnt hurting anybody. 
This proprietor, was extremely condensending,rude & obnoxious. 
Shame on Freedies Custard on Eastern Ave Las Vegas, NV."}
{"text":"I had the Freddy's Double Steak Burger. AMAZING! Their frozen custard is also amazing. This was my first time here and I am now a fan! This is where I eat every time I come to Arizona."}
{"text":"Great food, reminds me of home. A little pricey but the food is good. The place has been clean every time I have been there. Some workers need to grow up but over all I give it a 4.5 but no option for thay so I out 5"}
{"text":"I don't go here too often -- usually for lunch with a friend that works in the area -- but when I do go it's always a pleasant experience.  Both times I got the fries and I ADORE them.

Customer service is great!  Everyone is friendly, and they'll even clean your table for you.  I know some fast food places are picking up on that and it's a cool feature.

This place reminds me a lot of Steak 'n' Shake, but seeing as I lived in Texas for several years I do like SnS better.  However, Freddy's is certainly nothing to shake a stick at.  Easier location to get to and plenty of seating for all!  Their prices are higher than SnS but they also have a drive-thru (huge plus).

Taste-wise, I enjoy it.  I've had the fries, fries sauce, and burgers.  Those three are pretty darn tasty.  I definitely could NOT eat here every day because the meals are heavy (I ate around 2:30 pm and now 6 and some change hours later I still feel it in my tummy), but it's great to relax and get a bite with a friend.

Want to try their chili cheese fries... Perhaps next time.  Mmm I love chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I work at the Skechers in the same parking lot and I go here almost every day I work!! I love them!! The burgers are WAY BETTER than any place I've had in a long time! Even better than Fatburger! And everything is made to order. Sometimes I'll only get their fries because I'm broke, but still hungry. Wish they were closer to my house! I'd eat there even more often. So I guess it's a good thing they don't!"}
{"text":"This place takes me back to home. The first time I ever had Freddy's was in Edmond OK. 
When I knew they opened up in Henderson I've been making the travel from Aliante area to get a Chicago dog/burger combo with the shoestring french fries. And afterwords getting one of many choices of a concrete custard. I always get a regular size and wonder why I didn't get a mini lol. 
If you haven't had freddy's frozen custard stop in you will be very pleased. 



Build one on the north side of the valley!!!!!!! 
That's what will make this a five star rating. :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but the burgers are kinda small. The meat is smashed and grilled to smitherines sometimes. Great fry sauce though and great seasoning for the fries."}
{"text":"This Freddy's is great! I'm 9 months pregnant (due yesterday) and was craving burgers and fries. We got lunch and one of the employees gave us a Concrete on her out of sympathy  The custard is soooo thick and good! The burgers are yummy and the fries are delicious, even though they are tiny. But I think they are fun. I'm one happy lady!"}
{"text":"Best service, best burger hands down. They Just opened love this place. I got my food fast every one is on top of there game here. A+"}
{"text":"Last few times we've been here the foods been horrible and terrible Customer service. Today my burger was old and the cheese was all crusted on."}
{"text":"My child absolutely loves this place. He is in love with the burgers. Every time we drive around here and he sees the signs we have to stop. Service is hit or miss. Most hits but I've seen some misses. It can get busy and your order might not be perfect. I've had to repeat my order a couple times only to revive wrong anyways. Mistakes happen. Sometimes some employees might not be as friendly and approachable as you might like. Overall. 4 stars for the food. That's it. Could've been 5 if the other minor details were taken care of."}
{"text":"Best place to get a burger!! The California burger is awesome! We also tried the patty melt which was really good. My kids loved the chicken tenders. They also have fry sauce! After dinner we got custard sundaes and concretes. They were delicious! Kids love the dirt and worms, I tried the turtle sundae and my husband got the Hawaiian. Amazing customer service to top it off. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Freddy's. I had the Original Double Steak Burger and must say it was really good. There were plenty of fries of the shoe string variety. Good with their special Fry sauce. According to my wife, the PBC&B Custard Sundae was a reason to rate this place a 5. Frozen custard instead of the usual ice cream is an interesting twist. I'm not much of a fan of sweets so I left it a 4 star rating. The ambiance is similar to Steak and Shake only I like this place better. Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I was with my husband when suddenly we got starved. So we decide to eat at Freddy's. The food was very delicious. Especially the shoe string fries. My favorite.!"}
{"text":"I love their shoestring fries! The hotdog was awesome too. Not very fond of their burger buns but the patty is juicy enough tho. 
Also kudos for their service, they clean my table as fast as a Formula One race car tire changing team."}
{"text":"A coworker and I stopped in and had lunch around 12:30 a couple Thursdays ago. I had never been here before so I wasnt sure what to expect. We were greated by a cheerful and friendly young lady who helped me with the menu. We both ordered burgers and fries. Our food was ready quickly and was cooked as ordered and looked yummy. Freddy's food comes in a plastic basket and the atmosphere is kind of retro burger joint. Seating and tables were comfy. The place was busy, but not super packed. I wasn't sure about the extra skinny shoestring fries at first, but they're really good. My coworker had ranted about about Freddy's special sauce and it is good! I think you'll be happy you ate here! This is not just another fast food place! And when we visited a crew from the fire department and public works were there too! That to me is an extra star those guys know good food places! We're definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is a better-than-average fast-food restaurant.  The service is good, friendly, helpful, and consistent.  The steakburgers are good, as well as their frozen custard.  Food comes out in less than six minutes, usually.   It often gets crowded between 12-1."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Decor has a vintage look to it. Got a sundae and chicago dog.  Chicago dog bread was very crispy and crunchy.  Really unique."}
{"text":"2 or 2.5.  Eh....I don't think I can do it ever again.  I've tried Freddy's 3 times just to be sure and give them a fair shake.  The first bit is some social commentary.  Feel free to move on down to the meat of the review.  (See what I did there.  I did it twice).  

Are you bored?  Lonely?  Needy?  Well the new captive audience for you folks can be found in the nearest drive-thru.  Feel free to pull up and order 4 or 5 combos with TONS of modifications, and then add a few more random, single items just to prolong the conversation.  All told, you should be able to get someone's undivided attention for at least 20 minutes.  If you are really feeling in need of attention, please ask the person at the window all kinds of questions about when the mall opens, what stores are inside, and if they have ever tried Famous Dave's.  You could probably stretch that out to a full half hour of attention.  

Please ignore the blonde woman behind you mocking you and yelling out, \"Are you sure you're finished?  There are 2 items on the menu you didn't order!\"  OK.  I've only fantasized about doing that last part, but it's bound to happen if I'm ever in the perfect vortex of PMS, bladder capacity, sleep deprivation, and hunger.

Anyway, I've tried the burgers and dogs and shakes 3 times.  All have been a disappointment for the most part.  The first time I got the patty melt and it was really really greasy, but I was really, really hungry and I ate it anyway and boy oh boy did I pay the price.  Lost 10 lbs. that weekend.  I also ordered a chocolate malt and it was watery and had very little flavor.

Second time I ordered the combo with the regular hot dog and it was ok.  And Mr. M ordered the Freddy's Original double.  The fries were very greasy, but the dog was ok.  I thought about going back for a hot dog, but not a burger.  The burger was so greasy it was inedible.  Mr. M ended up getting a burger from Wendy's.  

Then I went back for the 3rd and final time and ordered a dog again with a little mustard and a little relish.  There was a huge amount of relish under the dog and the bun was hard and crumbly.  That didn't stop me from eating the wiener.  You know it.  The ice tea was ok.  The staff has always been friendly, but I just don't think I can do it again.  I have had better."}
{"text":"Ok so finally had the chance to try out their burgers. As I predicted their food wouldn't disappoint me. The double steak with cheese burger was Awesome... Yup im going to start coming back..."}
{"text":"Third visit here. Every time they have gotten my order just right. Even in drive-through, the car after a $45 order (wow, big family!), they got my special order patty melt right. No grilled onions, on sourdough, and with fry sauce and bacon.

Yes, that is my main attraction - FRY SAUCE! Love the stuff. I agree with the Yelpers that say it is like Steak N Shake, also with the Yelpers who say the burgers are a bit dry. Since I dunk every bite in the FRY SAUCE, I really don't care. Their onion rings have been outstanding. (Dipped in FRY SAUCE), perfectly golden brown and crunchy just the right size for soaking in...yeah, you got it, and beautifully crunchy. Personally I love the shoestring fries as well.....need I say what ladens each crunchy bite? 

Kudos on having more than one diet drink, though I wish it were Diet Mountain Dew rather than Diet Dr. Pepper. 

Haven't had any of the custards since my combo lasts me at least two meals. The combos were all a little strange, but I will try a cone or dish sometime.

Overall, Freddy's is a welcome change from the prior Fazoli's and I will probably be back for, at least, the onion rings and......FRY SAUCE!"}
{"text":"Came here to get dinner one night. Had never been here before but thought we'd try it out. The food was excellent (everything is made fresh to order) and so was the service. The frozen custard is so delicious!! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Currently pregnant and have been craving a Chicago dog so I opted to stop by Freddy's for one. The fries were good as usual but when I opened the box for the Chicago dog I was extremely UNHAPPY. I'll just post the picture of what I got. I understand it's fast food and all but really..."}
{"text":"Pretty good steak burgers. Especially if your in the mood for a burger. 

I got the double steakburger California style. My brother got the bacon & cheese steakburger. Also we got the Chicago dog & cheese curds. Everything tasted good. 

The California steakburger comes with onion, lettuce, tomatoe, & Freddy's sauce. It came with fries which are really thin. They have 2 sauces for the fries. One with jalapeños. 

The Chicago dog didn't feel like a lot on it. Not a lot of onion, not enough relish, no tomatoes on it. At least there was a pickle on it.  Ketchup, mustard, & mayo I put on myself. I guess I was suppose to tell them what I want on it. But no one told me.

The cheese curds were good. Cheesy! 

It's a pretty pricey place. For a meal is about $10 I guess depends what you get. They also have custard."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! This place was sooooo good. Came here for lunch with the hubby today and we will back. We both got double bacon cheeseburgers with fries and drinks and it was under $20. Fries were thin and super crispy just the way I like them. Burger patty was fresh and nicely seasoned. We didn't try the custard this time but we'll definitely be back to try them and the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Freddy's has some of the best frozen custard in the valley. Their custard is rich and creamy. They also have very good burgers. Don't care for the shoe string fries though.

This location is a good one to go to. I ordered a sundae and it was a good portion size along with good amount of nuts on top. 

Don't go to the location on Gilbert and Williams Field - I ordered the same sundae at this location and they really shorted me. My ice cream cup was not full and they only gave me 5 or 6 nuts literally. 

I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"I generally like freddie custard, but after going to this location today I will never go to this one again. My husband and I bought regular Sunday's which were almost 4 dollars. When I looked in my bag, the cups were not even full of ice-cream. The serving was extremely skimpy and it seemed like they just were trying to put as little in there as possible. 

I would not recommend thus location. I have been to 2 others and they were both better. I would suggest the location on baseline because I never had that issue there and have been many times. 

Overall, the ice cream is good, but not a great value for the money."}
{"text":"Kind of like Steak and Shake but much better. And they have FRY SAUCE! After living out west, and then moving to the midwest, I've really missed fry sauce. And this isn't just any fry sauce, this is PERFECT fry sauce. As for the burgers, they have perfectly crispy edges and very good onion rings. Their onion rings + fry sauce made my day. Yeah, it's busy because it just opened but go! It's delicious."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times we like it, staff is friendly and helpful! My food has always been hot! Not a fan of skinny fries but I like them every now and then! The burger is never dry but a but greasy! I personally did not like the fry sauce but they have ketchup too!! We went today actually and hubby got the chili hot dog, he loves home made ones but he said this one is not bad! They have Luzianne ice tea which is our favourite so can't beat that!!! Have not tried the custard but will one day!!!!!"}
{"text":"Their exterior made me want to go in. The red and yellow made me salivate. 

The guy at the counter looked tired. I ordered a california burger. The beef was very flat. The lettuce was 14 times thicker than the beef. 

The french fries were shoestring-like which is a good thing but overly salted which is not..

I went home with a mild tummy ache.

Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"In town visiting and was told that I needed to try Freddie's. I live in an area of SoCal with lots of In-n-Outs, a good local chain (Farmer Boys) and a recent invasion of Five Guys. I didn't think this place would be anything new. Happy to say, I was wrong.
The menu can be a bit overwhelming but it has a nice variety of food for everyone's taste. Yeah, the burgers are a bit thin and the fries probably will get cold before you finish them but, overall, the food was very good. The burgers had a good flavor and include a wide range of toppings. Freddie's has their own seasoning for fries that can be a little salty but does enhance the flavor. But what pushes Freddie's over the top is the frozen custard. Very good and they give you a wide range of options of toppings and mix-ins. Such a fantastic way to finish up your meal. 
Looking forward to seeing Freddie's in SoCal sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from southern Virginia and would often go to North Carolina and every time I did, I always made sure to stop at Steak n Shake which serves my favorite steakburgers!

Unfortunately AZ doesn't have them. :( But Freddy's is just as good!

Their burgers are awesome, very flavorful and fill you up quickly! I've read reviews saying that the burgers are too thin and I just go \"...Seriously?...\" They're SUPPOSED to be thin!!!!! What did you think a steakburger was, a slab of steak between a bun? They come with pickles, onion, mustard, and cheese. What I like is that they always ask if these toppings are okay and they'll gladly alter it to your liking if you don't want all that stuff.

The fries are delicious!!! If you love shoe string style, then this is the place to get them. Always hot and cripsy with the right amount of seasoning. Make sure you get some fry sauce, which is pretty much like Big Mac and In N Out sauce (but without the chunks of pickles or whatever it is that's in those) to dip them in!  Sauce also goes great on the burgers. 

I've only ever come here for the burgers and fries, but I've heard some good things about the custard which I'll have to get next time I'm in. 

So next time you're over at Chandler Fashion and are debating on the numerous restaurants all around, give a Freddy's a try!"}
{"text":"Good selection. Great customer service. Food is really good. Had a lot of food from here would definitely suggest it."}
{"text":"I thought I already wrote a review for Freddy's and thought it just got filtered but nope.  Even thought I had a picture and a tip but nope.  Was I imagining my whole Freddy's experience?  Anyways I am a fan of their good.  It seems like more of these amazing burger spots are coming here. 

Their burgers were mighty tasty.  You can order singles, doubles, and triples.  As originals (pickles, onion, cheese and mustard), in California style (onion, tomato, lettuce, cheese, and thousand island sauce), or however which way you wanted it.  Just expect it to be a little messy when you eat it.  I've had the Double Steakburger California style and the Original Double Patty Melt both very very delicious.  Not a fan of shoestring fries but they were well made.  It should be more of a topping added to the burger and piled with fry sauce that's at least how I do it.

It gets incredibly packed during lunch, good luck finding a seat.  A bunch of us from work came here and we ended up seating at random table that freed up.  We probably sat at 4 different tables scattered throughout the dining area.  There are a lot of seats but it just gets busy.  They do have a drive thru. I don't like their booths they are long and can fit a bunch of people but everyone has to get out for if the person closest to the wall needs to get out.  Because it gets busy during lunch, this one time they must have mopped but didn't place those caution signs and I slipped but didn't fall.  I was holding the food tray and my food was sliding freely on my tray.  Try balancing your food on a tray while not falling on but sliding all over the place on a slippery surface.  Would've been one hell of a mess.

I still have to go back for their custards and milkshakes but it is getting warmer so maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"Fair prices and delicious food. Not to mentiom short wait times! If im ever craving a burger and fries, I go here. Theyre milkshakes and custards are to die for. The fries are thin and always crispy."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place to go, I'm not sure whats happened, new management, budget cuts? Theres one car in front of me and it still takes over 10 minutes to get food, then I live 2 minutes away and my food is cold and custard is melted when I get home. I thought I was waiting so long because you were making my order hot off the grill. I also noticed the produce isn't as fresh and it's scarce. I NEVER had this problem here until recently and its been this way every single time. My family, who lives down the street, has also noticed, and sadly, I don't think any of us are interested in returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My chicken strip was still frozen in the inside. Nasty! This location doesn't have their stuff together. Be aware."}
{"text":"We just moved here from CA and decided to try this place. We all loved it so much that whenever family or friends come into town this is one of the first spots we take them! I have gluten issues and found I can eat here with a burger wrap and have no issues! I am even able to eat the fries as well as the custard!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of these griddled thin patties with crusty edges, you can have the thick burger.  Freddy's is a no frill burger with basic toppings which suits my taste just fine. Order the double steak burger with cheese and you wont be disappointed. Great  thin cut fries and don't forget the Concretes made with custard style ice cream which is creamier and richer than your standard ice cream. It can be expensive but look around at other burgers joints and you will see high prices there as well, I mean beef is expensive.

Freddy's is clearly better than Steak and Shake and you don't have to leave a tip since its counter service.

{"text":"Went in on June 29th and heard a roaming worker that they opened 2 hours ago. The place was packed with workers training and everything ran smoothly. Everything is new and clean, even the parking lot. As advertised food was cooked when you order it and served quickly.

I never had a steakburger so I don't know if this is typical. The patties are very thin, smashed down and well done. So get a double. It's not messy at all (darn) and dry. You have to pay extra for lettuce and tomato- I was like whaaaat. The \"butter toasted\" buns didn't have that satisfying buttery taste I expected. We also ordered the patty melt. The bread on the melt was some herbed variety that I found more jarring than harmonious. The fries are shoestring fries dusted in seasoning. It was a generous amount of fries. They did give me ranch without having me pay for it, but it was warm from a box. Good thing it was loaded with preservatives.

I know people have a cult mentality for this chain, but it didn't feel it. I'd return to try a concrete. I guess I imagined a messy drippy burger."}
{"text":"Shut the front door!!! This place taste like Steak & Shake crashed into In & Out, Yummy!!!! The burgers are \"Real\" beef patties, pressed paper thin:) And the fries are paper thin:) OMG and the special dipping sauce!!! This is my new favorite spot for burgers! 

The inside was very busy and the drive through was slower than normal... But it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We came here because our 5 year old was hungry.  She got the kids meal hot dog and fries.  WOW, the hotdog was huge for a kids meal, maybe quarter pound and a ton of fries.  Its more than adult size.  I ate most of her fries, lol.

The shake was extremely thick.  It comes with a straw about 3/8\" diameter and you can't get the shake through it.  It was chocolate and quite strong.  Very good.  

I look forward to next time and maybe I'll try a sunday.  Mmm.  This place beats McDonalds or Wendy's across the street."}
{"text":"Time to update my review!  Our family still continues to frequent this location.  Great food made fresh and we love that they have vegetarian options.  We had Hailey assist us on our last visit and she was so friendly and helpful in making suggestions.  Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all.
I had someone in from of me that took 10 minutes to order.
Then it took another 10 minutes to pickup there order.
So now I've been here for 20 minutes.
I had a double cheese bacon steak-burger with Frys and a Pepsi.
The steak burger was so over cooked that it had no taste at all.
So maybe others like to not taste anything at all but not me!
So maybe I had a bad experience so in the future I will try it one more time.
I hope I don't waste my time and money."}
{"text":"My and I visited during its opening day at noon, and it was slammed packed. The staff handled the crowd very well, and the wait was very minimal. My wife had the Veggie burger combo, and California double cheeseburger combo. The Veggie burger (black bean based) had a nice consistency, very similar to a good frozen beef pattie. It was very tasty and moist. She loved the extra thin fries with the delicious seasoning. Fountain Pepsi was her drink, and it was good. My California burger was fantastic. Temperature, taste and texture were unbelievable. I loved the seasoning of the fries, but the extra thinness was not a favorite of mine. We both loved their famous fry dipping sauce, which kind of reminds you of Zaxbys  Zax sauce. I had a fountain Barq's root beer, but it had too much carbonation. We didn't try any desserts on this visit, due to the crowd, but they all looked great. Pricing was in line with the quality. Service was excellent as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"That's some bs we told the cashier that we wanted chilli cheese fries and I get home and the f*** fries only has cheese like where is the chilli???? Very disappointed I mean it's some bs!!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves the triple steak burgers. However I hate the custom service, I get the general impression I have bothered them in some way by ordering. I usually always go through drive thru, and it never fails that I have to repeat my order at least once. I only ever order the triple burger by itself, no frills, and no special."}
{"text":"On my way to Freddy's again. My first time around I came twice in one day (once by myself and again for the family and I). I've mostly tried the burgers but I have explored the menu and will be trying the fish sandwich and a coney. I've had the chili cheese fries which is why I rated a 4 star. They weren't the best, but I know if I special order them they'll be like all the other. 

Anyhow, headed there for the works I want a Double Cali with shoestring fries.

Can't wait."}
{"text":"I had the chili cheese dog.  It was delicious.   They bun was grilled which made it extra great.  I loved the seasoning that they had up by the registers for the fries!!  Made the fries literally perfect.  Can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Dare I say it? This is a step up from In-n-Out. The burgers are comparable, the fries are stringier and imho just a little bit better, and they offer a wider menu selection with things like hot dogs, chicken fingers, and many dessert options."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Everything is seasoned great. Skinny cut French fries. Good price. Just be prepared to wait a little longer for your food because they cook it to order. Worth the wait for sure!"}
{"text":"I told my son that he could pick anywhere he wanted to eat dinner last night because he had a good week in school. He wanted some Freddy's action which I was not about to argue because I wanted to try the Chicago dog and chili cheese fries. I didn't care too much for the Chicago dog but not because of the quality, turns out it's just not my thing but I'm glad I tried it. The chili cheese fries were frickin awesome though. For $3.30 you get this huge basket with the perfect amount of chili, cheese and onions. Certainly not a heathly choice but c'mon you don't go to a place like Freddy's for a salad
I love their double California burger and the Dirt and Worms custard. Two grabtastically thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars just because the staff was super friendly....
The burger patties were on salt overload! Geezuz, I think mine was just salt with a side of beef. That special sauce on my burger wasn't good, nor were those fry sauces. I guess when you're used to In-n-Out spread nothing compares....
Those fries were hard, cold and salty as well! Someone cooking just had have been salt happy. 
Finally tried this place and I'd rather suffer going through a casino to eat at the \"other\" steak burger joint. This place is even pricier than the \"other\" place. Waste of $20 for 2 people. Blah! We couldn't even eat our meals, garbage it was!"}
{"text":"burgers overcooked. chicken tenders very dry.  custards too thick. cant wait for a better custard place to open soon. overall just a blah experience. every employees takling over us while we were eating like we werent there."}
{"text":"Burger has good flavor and like the crispy fries. I think for the price there isn't much better."}
{"text":"Went in this evening to see what all the hype was about. That's just what it is, hype. Tasteless burgers, soggy fries and greasy onion rings. My husband said the shake was just ok. I spent $ 38 on mediocre food at best. I could have spent half the amount and made it better myself at home. Oh, and don't waste your money on the cheese fries. They look NOTHING like the picture on the menu ( see attached photo). They maybe put two teaspoons of cheese on the fries. Save your money or go to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Extremely courteous staff! Delicious hamburger and love the skinny fries! The custards are excellent."}
{"text":"Freddie's is great! The burgers are always hot and fresh and tastes absolutely fantastic. The fries are delicious and the season salt goes with everything. The custard is something I wasn't familiar with but after trying it it is a definite must have. Everything is always made fresh and the staff is very pleasant. A very good value I come here with my whole family."}
{"text":"I love the thin fries and the burgers are good too.
Another decent fast food chain.
This store is clean.
Staff is friendly.
Have never wronged me by shorting me an item in drive thru.
Great chain."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time in this junt. The steakburgers are ok. They got my burger wrong please see my pictures. Everyone is kind you don't have to wait all day for your food. But attention to details is everything to me. They say they treat each order as if it is a special order well they need to prove it to me. Because each time I've been in here to eat they got my order wrong. The place looked pretty clean I seen flies in the place so I choose to eat in my car. But I guess they can't help the flies. Over all I will return the husband says he would give them 5 stars but this is not my husband's review I proudly issue them 3 stars total."}
{"text":"I had just moved to Henderson from out of state and I was looking for new places to try. Freddy's looked like a fun place so I put it on my list .
This place is awesome! Great food, love the skinny fries, great service, very friendy, great prices. This place is now on my Saturday afternoons must do list."}
{"text":"Last night we tried Freddy's for the first time. At first glance you can see the obvious similarities with \" IN AND OUT BURGER\".  Lots of staff. The kitchen area is open, so you can see how the food is prepared. You order and you are called up by your number. You also notice the menu is more extensive than IN AND OUT BURGER, and Freddy's has frozen custard available for dessert. The bun for the hamburger is very fresh. Now let's take a look under the bun. Two smaller hamburger patties, grilled crispy on the edges, tomatoes, lettuce, Freddy's famous sauce, ( a hybrid of thousand island dressing) mustard and cheese if you prefer. Very fresh tasting and served hot. The French fries are a \" shoestring style\", very thin.  You get more than enough French fries with your order. For my wife and I to have 2 burger combos ( burger, fries and a drink), and 2 small frozen custard desserts, it was approximately $25.00. The food was all very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot.  Seems like this area's answer to Culver's.  Good if you want a change from the typical burger chains in that they're steak burgers have more flavor in the meat and its crispier on the outside like the fried charred endings you get off the grill.  Shoestring fries which are overly salted and they have \"freddy's sauce\" which is just like thousand island type Big Mac sauce.  Careful coming on a Friday night as it's riddled with annoying high school kids. Typical meal is around $8"}
{"text":"Went there like 1 week ago Amazing customer service I swear!!! On point with everything! As we walk to the door there a worker opening the door for us and as we sit and eat our food employees are walking around to ask us if we needed anything! Will b going back soon!"}
{"text":"Before I could write this review, I had to put on my pajamas with the elastic waist.I affectionately refer to these as my \"fat pants\" ,and break them out for special occasions. Truth be told, I overate tonight. I wanted to stop midway through my meal, but it was too damned good.

I love all kinds of burgers! Sliders, turkey burgers, green chile burgers, and of course steak burgers. Freddy's has perfected the steak burger-sorry Steak n' Shake. I chose the Double Steakburger (California Style), which consisted of 2 patties,cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a thousand island sauce on a soft delicious bun ($7.29 for the combo). Wow! The burger was so juicy and tasty on it's own, I didn't even need anything else to go with it. 

However, the burger came with a pile of shoestring french fries that were seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.I never eat all of my fries as I usually save my room for the burger and soft drink. Until now! I put those things down and took it as personal challenge to finish every last one. 

Then, my wife had to mention dessert. Hah? No way! Oh, OK! Did someone say PBC & B sundae? Vanilla custard , Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, banana, whipped cream & cherry-sounds good right? My wife and I split the mini sundae ($3.59), and it was plenty. But then again, I was full long before the sundae arrived."}
{"text":"For being a fast food restaurant Freddies is very good. The service is very good and fast. Custard is excellent."}
{"text":"Really amazing chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!

Since my sister came with us on this trip I knew she would be yelping stuff for dinner! However by the time my mom and I came back to the hotel we were exhausted so I knew we wouldn't be going out to a restaurant! 

My sister found this (its literally 5 minutes away from the hotel) and we came around 8ish, it wasn't crowded and we had a super friendly cashier! Normally I get looks because I order off the kids menu but she even asked me if I wanted to upgrade my drink which I did LOL! 

My sister ordered the chili, a hamburger and we shared a hotdog! We got all this food for $17.00! I knew this place was different than most fast food spots because we waited about 10 minutes for our food and it came out extremely FRESH!! Also they gave us a extra burger and fries on accident! We ended up taking it back to the room for my mom and she loved it! 

The Freddy sauce is crack to me! As well as the special seasonings they use! The burger tastes super fresh and homemade as if your mom made it for you! The hot dog was on this amazing hot dog bun not your typical white bun! 

My sister took home a Oreo cookie sandwich and she said it was delicious just like everything else they made! The chili is amazing as well even though it didn't have beans I still loved it! 

This is one of the upsides to moving out here! Freddy's could get me into trouble!

{"text":"My Daughter and I decided to try this place out since we had been shopping at Audio Express because we wanted to try the custard. The Staff was very friendly and helped us out since it was our first time eating there. I had the Double Steak Burger meal and she had a Grilled Cheese Sandwich. When the food arrived they gave my Daughter free fries to try and both our orders were delicious. The manager, Joshua, stopped by the table to see how everything tasted and asked if we were going to try the custard for dessert. We told him we were and he said to tell the cashier it was on him. The custard was awesome and we think better than Culver's. That was a very nice thing to do and we were impressed with the whole staff and our experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"So it's super quick, really inexpensive and the people that work there are awesome, I mean they are always walking around wiping tables and asking people if they can clear the baskets when you are done eating. The food was good I had a lettuce wrapped cheeseburger (lame, I know I know) and my kids had kids chicken fingers and cheeseburger and couldn't finish their baskets. My kids loved the shoestring fries!

We had sundaes after, we all had minis which were huge! We had dirt and worms, Hawaiian, and the pbc something? The one with bananas and Reese's.  I thought the toppings were plentiful, I thought the custard tasted a little artificial (or something? There was a weird taste) but I am not a frequent custard eater so it could totally be me. So I was eating and happy until I found a hair embedded in the custard which was super gross but they remade me a new one real quick. 

It was good, I would go back but skip the custard for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! Everyone here is super friendly and helpful. They all had smiles in their faces and were genuinely engaged in conversation. I've been to other Freddy's and this one is the one I go to. It's a little further drive for me but I don't mind it. Thank you guys for your positive vibes."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars \"A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for helping me expect the potential unexpected.

As others state, this isn't your typical savory, juicy, meat loaded burger. This is a burger has a much thinner patty, is a bit crispy (on the outside), has great toppings, and in all honesty, is one of the better fast food burgers I've had. Decided to go with ol' #1 - because if a #1 can't be done right in a fast food restaurant then they can't do anything right. Burger included two patties, 2 slices of cheese, onion, pickle, and decided to have them substitute the mustard for Freddy's sauce. Excellent choice if I do say so myself. The burger was cooked perfect, crispy outside, not overcooked inside. The Freddy's sauce made the burger & fries spectacular. My order was to go, but I was happy to see that they had Freddy's seasoning salts right at the to go counter available to use prior to leaving the restaurant. Great service, got the food quickly, and I definitely plan on going back.

The decor inside the restaurant is great, very 50's looking - and more importantly it's CLEAN. How often do you walk into a fast food chain restaurant and see tables that look like a flock of 4yo's dominated a smorgasbord? 

I can't wait to go back and try some of their custard. If they taste half as good as the pictures look I may be checking back in with a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Beautiful new building with energetic staff. We went on opening day so there is room to grow but it was very well run for an opening day. 

Custard was good, but Rita's is better. Freddy's is more ice cream consistency and the flavor was refreshing though. It is piped down a long chute and is then scooped versus a softer serve style like they have at Rita's. The sundaes are pretty creative. Kids had the dirt and worms, brownie sundae, and their signature Turtle sundae. For me, I prefer to start out plain because if you can't get the basic, it doesn't matter what toppings you put on it. So, plain-Jane custard cone for me. All were tasty but again, more ice creamy than custardy. 

Fast service though considering how packed they were and the drive thru seemed to hustle through pretty well as well...way better than at Culvers. 

Looks like we've got a winner! I'll be back to try the burgers and will update my review from there. But, a good solid start and a welcome variety to Surprise."}
{"text":"Tried the Freddy's in Vegas. Fries were great especially when you added their fry sauce. Burger was tasty but the single didn't have enough meat. Next time I'll get a double. The custard dessert (costs extra) was very good but a bit overpriced. I'll try it again if they open one near me."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  From opening the door to picking up our trays!  Very friendly staff, clean, and good burgs.  5 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to this Freddy's several times and love it. The burgers, fries and hot dogs are all delicious every time. They always give a large portion of fries and non-stop pop. Service is always very quick and employees are friendly. Great old rock and roll music always playing inside. This is by far the best fast food place anywhere."}
{"text":"This is why I like yelp.

Driving around hungry I looked for a hot dog place and found Freddy's Frozen Custard Steakburgers, the reviews looked good so I ventured out and heading there.
Bigger building than I thought, and very quick at taking your orders, I went at a lunch time and only had about 4 people ahead of me which was a 5 min wait.
Upon getting my hot dog \"a chili cheese with onions hot dog\" and string fries, I went over to the condiment station.  I recommend the fry sauce next to where you pick up your order, it's a wonderful blend of mayo and ketchup (well that's what it tasted like to me) but it goes great with the hot fries.
The hot dog was perfect, no way you can eat it with your hands you have to use a knife and fork, but the pop you get from the hot dog when you bite into it was great and the chili was beefy and very tasty it was not spicy but with the melted cheese and fresh white onions it went great with the dog.
I will be going back to try their Steakburger as they looked great as well.
If your in the area I would highly recommend this place for a good quality meal for very few $$$$$$"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I've been here twice and both times I wasn't very satisfied. The #1 meal - The Freddy's Double - should be the best they have to offer. I found the meat dry and over cooked. I had a few bites I thought were going to damage dental work I've had done. I really don't care for the fries. They are too small and bland. If I wanted a crappy burger and tiny fries I already had the option of going to Steak N Shake down the street. The staff has already become less than enthusiastic. There are 11 people in here and the employee calling out orders is talking loud enough that patients at CMC Northeast can likely hear my order is ready. I've had the custard and didn't think it was that good. If I can come in again and pass on it, it can't be that good."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, quick service, and great customer service. We usually order hot dogs and chili cheese fries. (:"}
{"text":"I discovered Freddy's a few months ago, and it has since worked it's way into my lunch rotation since it is fairly close to where I work.  The burgers are unique compared to the norm, if not a little greasy.  The staff has always been more than friendly, especially during those early days when I wasn't quite sure what constitutes a \"steakburger\".   On every visit an employee walks by asking how our meal was and clears our trays for us, which isn't  service you don't get at many fast food joints.  Maybe one day I will leave enough room to try their famous frozen custard!"}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time here! I had the signature turtle custard and it was soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Uhhh, In-N-Out who? I loved this place! When it comes to burgers, I like mine to taste home-grilled and sloppy. The more ketchup, mustard, pickles and onions, the better. This place reminded me of my dad's burgers - they were delicious and juicy and oddly comforting. There were plenty of condiments so I could pack on the flavor and not to mention the fry sauce is to die for. I would take that over animal sauce any day. As a true burger lover, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great fast food joint for hot dogs and hamburgers! I tried the chili cheese dog and Chicago style hot dog and I have to say my favorite was the Chicago hot dog! The staff is very friendly and nice! No complaints at this place 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My families favorite burger chain restaurant! Food is solid, they use ground sirloin and make the patties thin, you need at least a double. I like the original and the California style (similar to in-n-out style), get the chili cheese fries if you're feeling hungry!!! Ps: they now have fried cheese curds and they are amazing!"}
{"text":"It's pretty rare for me to write fast food reviews. But considering I have always have superb experiences, it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve. As far as I know, until now, Vegas only had one Freddy's location. I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them. 
They serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a \"Freddy's sauce\" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc. 
They also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts. 
The service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people. 
Do yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is probably in my top 5 fast food burger joints. Their classic burger includes mustard, pickles, and onions. Basically, they won me over right there! 
Oh, and a regular burger is a double- be warned. For those of you who aren't feelin that-, they have a California burger. More classic style with a fry sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. 
You can tell everything is fresh, and they use a good quality beef. The also offer hot dogs, shakes, malts, and fries. 
Usually I don't even review fast food- but this is one place I can go when I don't want fast food, but I still want cheap and convenient. 
I have seen them do specials too, like a green chile burger. And they will customize, want grilled onions, just ask. 
This is how fast food should be. Why people still eat Mcdonalds when there is Freddys, baffles me!"}
{"text":"The main reason my husband and I go to Concord area is the mall. We decided to eat a Bad Daddy's before going to the mall but when we got there they have such a huge line and the waiting time was at least 45 minutes. Forget it! 20 minutes is the longest I can wait so we decided to try Freddy's instead. This was our first time in this place and it looked like an old fashion dinner.
The staff was really nice an attentive, we couldn't figure what to order and the cashier explained the menu and gave suggestions. I went with BLT, my husband patty melt and we shared a chilli cheese fries. Oh my gosh! They have slim fries, I love them because normally they are crunchier than regular size fries. Also the portion was pretty decent and was good!
My burger was good, I loved it. I am not a fast food kind of gal but those fries and hamburger were amazing! The hamburger was a little bit dried around and juice in the middle, to me it was perfect but I bet some people would not appreciate the dried border of their meet.
They have a interesting selection of custards too and we could not go home without trying one. I had a Hawaiian (something), vanilla custard, macadamia, coconut, pineapple and strawberry, it was simply amazing! My husband had a chocolate custard with brownie that he said was good. 
They have different sizes of cups you can choose from and even the smallest one comes loaded with custard and toppings. 
We really enjoyed our time here and will be back."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is super crackin' so either order to go or send someone in to get a table.

I got the bacon burger combo(number 8 I think?) and it was pretty good. It tasted fresh. And the cheese fries! Lord! #slapcity so bomb. I had to dock off a star 'cause the burger completely fell apart and it basically turned into a salad. But all in all, fresh.

After dinner, ordered the turtle sundae. The custard was very good. The other ingredients mediocre. The only downside is that it literally melted right away. Lol.

The staff is VERY attentive, not sure if they're allowed to take gratuity but it would be nice if they did. Very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Portion is great for 8 dollars i go there two times a month. I typically get anything with bacon so i go for the number 7 combo which is a double bacon cheeseburger. The sundaes are great i havent tried any other one but the turtle. There is vegeterian options since my sister goes for meatless mondays its worth a try. I have recommended this place to many others"}
{"text":"I have been to Freddy's many times and it's always consistent and delicious. I like that there are a lot of options from which to choose from burgers, hotdogs, chili fries, etc. I'm a big fan of the California burger (with extra sauce) and their fries are always perfectly crunch. Take heed, they're food is rather greasy but it's worth it."}
{"text":"From their sandwiches to their burgers I've got to say they are really good and tasty , if you want to try something new Freddy's has fry sauce and different custard combinations . It is absolutely to die for!! So many sweets and meals to order . I know you will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad Freddy's opened a branch closer to us!  Had a Double Steakburger Cali Style Combo (added bacon cause you just have to) and my wife had the Single Steakburger Combo.  Solid meal at a solid price.  Wanted to split a custard after but, as always after eating here, was way too stuffed!  Burgers are really tasty - better than Shake Shack, IMHO.  Not quite equal to In N Out but delicious nonetheless!

Tasty burgers, fast service, genuinely friendly staff, and super clean restaurant - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, you get it right away and the French Fries are crispy they are one of the best in town."}
{"text":"I love their burgers fries and custard. If you are in a hurry go inside don't go in the drive thru. It takes a while because it's fresh made to order. Friendly staff. Delicious."}
{"text":"Wow first timer here and wow pure yummies!!! Their custard is the closest Ive had since being on the east coast."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a new burger joint and this is the second time I have eaten at Freddy's and their burgers are bomb. Very tasty, juicy and very filling. The sauce they have for their fries is really good too. I got the number 6 this time around."}
{"text":"Highly recommend dine in only here. Ordered drive thru last night and once again once we were home which is right around the corner the food was cold! Especially the fries which is a bummer. Had the burger and hot dog combo, was tasty and filling lol hawaiian delight sundae was ok. The macadamia nuts tasted old. The cherry and strawberries were delightful. Expected there to be pineapple in it. Bummed there wasnt."}
{"text":"Food was fast and tasty, custard was delicious and creamy, my only issue was the fries were ice cold and when I let a manager know they were pretty much like oh well..."}
{"text":"i absolutely love the burgers here. I have also tried their custard, and enjoyed it. The only minor complaint I have is that the tables inside tend to be dirty when I go in."}
{"text":"I love Freddy's the location on 51st and bell and up near 75th and bell. They have the best shoe string fries. And all around good American food. Deserts and their fry sauce are to die for. Don't forget the cheese curds, they sound gross but they are just bite size cheese sticks."}
{"text":"They seem to do everything right. Great fast food! I get the number one and haven't ventured far from there except to try the patty melt which was great. 
The wife loves the Veggie burger and the custard is legit.
One afternoon I hit the drive through and when I got home I was missing an item. Next time I mentioned it to the manager... My whole lunch was free. So I'm loyal now. If you haven't tried Freddy's your missing out."}
{"text":"This isn't Bachi or BurGR so not fair to compare to other great burger places we have in Vegas.  They are not mind blowing or innovative and that's ok.  These are fast food burgers.  The burgers are small, kinda smashed thin and a little greasy.  All of which I like.  They remind me of an old school burger at the frosty I would get as a kid.  They are similar to Steak n Shake and In n Out.  The custard is good too, tons of flavors/options to customize your concrete or sundae.  I don't crave burgers often but when I do it is usually Freddy's."}
{"text":"Running errands and missed breakfast and lunch. Freddy's happened to be the closest place to  eat. WOW! The burgers are amazing! Freshly made, well seasoned and full of deliciousness.I do not eat french fries but my husband says Freddy's are really good. 
I typically avoid fast food but....once in a while we get so busy we need something fast. This will be our go to fast food place!"}
{"text":"delicious for a quick burger joint! get the double though, as the parties are thin. awesome sized serving of fries. and the concretes can't be beat by any ice cream place around."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious, juicy burger, Freddy's has got you covered! I've been to this location a handful of times before, but I wasn't fully convinced that I was a fan of this place until tonight. (4/17/17)

My family and I stopped by for dinner and as soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted by an employee. I wish I would've gotten his name because he provided excellent customer service throughout our entire visit! Anyways, one of the first things that caught my attention was how freaking clean this place is! I mean c'mon, I don't expect much from fast-food joints, but this place is spotless! From the tables to the floors, to the windows, to the walls... I was really impressed. 

Freddy's is well-known for their Steakburgers. I personally like the steakburgers because the patty is thin and it becomes crisp when grilled. It's not hard to tell that the meat is of good quality either. After a few visits to Freddy's, you too will agree that this place is up there in the rankings with In-N-Out. I paired my Freddy's Original Double with fries because why would I choose applesauce? The fries are shoestring style and perfect for dipping. Freddy's offers an unlimited supply of their extra secret Fry Sauce at the counter where you pick-up your order. The Fry Sauce also comes in a spicy version which I prefer. It's tangy and adds a little kick to your already flavorful meal.

Freddy's is also well-known for their frozen custard dessert. I'm not quite sure what the difference is between ice cream, frozen yogurt, and frozen custard, but they all taste the same to me. Freddy's frozen custard is no different than the custom bowl of goodness that you put together at Yogurtland. The Dirt n' Worms Sundae is a winner with me. I just like it because it brings me back to my childhood days... Pure nostalgia!

Overall, a great place to eat with the family! Good food, clean establishment, and the atmosphere is fun. I get that 1950's diner vibe... I love it! Thanks, Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Good food. Finally a place that offers fry sauce. Family had single burger, hotdog, patty melt, fries, strawberry concrete, choc brownie concrete, lemonade. Place was busy on Saturday night, but handled crowd ok."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, the food is always great. Most recently I ordered food to go, a double cheeseburger lettuce wrapped. They didn't do it, they put it on a bun. Not a huge issue, I just ate the patties and cheese a little more savage-like than I wanted to. I've had their Hawaiian delight concrete, amazing stuff if you like tropical fruits. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location! The staff are always very friendly, knowledgable and clean! We usually get our food out fairly quickly and fresh. I usually get their delicious Freddie double which is always cooked perfectly and the fries OMG the thin shoestring fries are my absolute favorite! Moving on to the selection of custards and flavors, I definitely  rank them very close to Culvers!!!! Creamy, rich and flavorful!!!  Food wise I have nothing but great things to say, the price is really affordable, not as cheap as McDonald's but you are getting quality food! What tips this 4/5 star was the employees, I know it's hard to work in any customer service some days but I love to see them greet customers and being genuine, I applaud to great customer service and the team for keeping this place very clean and fresh each and every time we have visited! Kudos to your team for excellent leadership!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm jealous. Usually when I come visit the fam in AZ, I get jealous over SOMETHING. Pink Taco (RIP), drive-thru Panda Express, Saddle Ranch or whatever. On the way to g-ma's house I see \"frozen custard\" on the sign and HAD to stop...and I'm glad i did. 

The burger was pretty damn good, but the custard was DY-NO-MITE! Oh, and the fries....best fries I've had from a \"fast food\" place. If you live in AZ, you owe it to yourself to try this place. If you're not in AZ, u might wanna make a visit just for Freddie's. I know I will...until they get sense enough to open one in S.D."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a review for a fast food joint. This location is across the parking lot from Discount Tire. I never had a steak burger, and was very surprised how good it was. The staff was very friendly, and visibly working very hard, and the order was ready in a few minutes. Give it a shot. It's a good burger. The only reason why 4 out 5 stars is because of the fries. They remind me of the shoe string fries in a can. Clean restaurant. Clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru, and service was very slow. I only ordered a small scoop of vanilla custard. The cashier could not multitask. I saw my custard sitting on the counter for at least 10 minutes. Horrible service, but really good custard. Similar to Joe-Latti in Anaheim. I'd come back if I have the patience for the lackluster service."}
{"text":"This was my first time going so I didn't know what to expect but the burgers were thin as pancakes. I ordered a patty melt and I had bread, meat, cheese and onion. No sauce but I don't know if it comes with sauce. The pancakes were so thin the edges were hard. I won't go again."}
{"text":"Only my 2nd time there. Horrible service at the drive thru! The female was rude & spoke too fast. When I asked her to repeat she was short. A male came back on & responded instead. He was just as rude. Not friendly at window but they were touchy & playful with each other after they closed the window. Lol teens? 
Again only my 2nd time here so I had questions & I don't think \"what kind of tea do you have\" should create a rude impatience. Especially when they were not busy. Oh the food was good enough."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS I love this place! It's pretty rare that I say I love a place but man was this place good! 

Not only was it a good atmosphere and cute decor but the staff was nice and we got our food quickly! The portions of the food are pretty large as well- fries portion was enough for 2 people!"}
{"text":"I'd had Freddy's before in a different city and was OBSESSED. So happy they opened this location close to home. The staff here were very friendly! The burgers are delicious!!! And the Freddy fry sauce is absolutely addicting!"}
{"text":"FIRST TIME TRYING.

I went through the drive through.
Best customer service.
I'm usually hard on drive through because usual drive through employees are lousy and  a bit prude, but NOT FREDDYS.

Fast and 100% customer service even through drive through.

EXPERIENCE:

Drove up and was greeted right away with a friendly and welcoming voice.

I told the girl that it's my first time and I asked her which was better, the number 1 or number 7? She told me number 6 with bacon. She did not hesitate to tell me what and enjoyed and to be honest I'm glad she told the truth! 

I also ordered a mini chocolate milk shake and OH MY GOSH, best
Chocolate shake I ever had!!!

Got my order quick and they greeted me goodbye! Definitely coming back!

THEIR STEAKBURGERS ARE THE BEST AND THEIR FOOD IS NOT OILY AT ALL.


No regrets. I'll be back for great service!"}
{"text":"Why eat at In-n-Out when there's Freddys?  They may not be able to steamroll I-n-O on the milkshake factor but their burgers are better, the fries are tied, they have hot dogs (big bonus points) and the clincher is the frozen custard.  They have great little sundaes and they are always nice."}
{"text":"We used the drive through on our first visit here about a week or two ago. After I went several blocks away (finding a place to park in the shade...not so easy in the Vegas area...), I discovered that instead of my teen son's favorite burger of all time aka a Bacon Cheeseburger, we received a grilled chicken sandwich. Definitely not the same.  lol  I had to go back and get the right burger or it was going to be a LONG day!  (He has Asperger's and although he isn't as stuck on certain foods as many are, he definitely has a real THING for Bacon Cheeseburgers!)

I had to go in, because the line had gotten really long since we left. The manager (who did NOT take our order initially) was really nice about it and apologized sufficiently for the mix up. She also offered us a small container of their frozen custard because of the mix up. After that, I told her that I really appreciate how she took care of the situation, mentioned how my son with Asperger's (which was why it was so important to get the right kind of burger) was waiting in the van with our dog (with the AC going), and that it was our first time ever at a Freddy's. Then she looked even more upset about the mix up and I was like, \"No, you did a great job.\" See thanked me and apologized again.

I didn't say a thing about being on Yelp and the fact that I would be leaving a review. She was just that concerned about leaving a great impression and providing a positive experience for her customers.  I do wish that I caught her name, though. It was on a Wednesday just before noon and she is a bit on the short side and I believe wore glasses (it looked like there may have been another manager at the time, too, and she was taller).

Since I had to go in after all... I got to see the cute interior. It looks like a cross between In and Out, Steak n Shake, and Dairy Queen Brazier. I believe that their burgers are better than Steak n Shake (at least our local one up north) and they have a menu that is more extensive than In and Out along with quite a few frozen custard choices.

We will definitely go again if we are in the Vegas area and in the need of a burger!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Freddy's in Indian Land.  It was brand new but the staff training must have been pretty good as the place ran smoothly, was clean and they were able to get  product out in good order.

I strongly disagree with people who throw out five star ratings on a first visit.  How can you have tried everything at different times of the day to so judge?  In one visit can I go 4-stars as a \"fan\"?  Or can I go 5-stars saying that Freddy's is as good as it gets?  Absurd.  Three stars = A-OK.  Over time and repeat visits they just might get 4 stars.

In my case, it was a first visit and it was A-OK.  I just had a double burger meal with fries and a soda.

Freddy's model is similar to Whataburger, In and Out Burger and Steak and Shake.  The ordering is done, you wait, and you pick up the order when your number is called, a la Whataburger/In and Out Burger.  The product is a sh-mushed beef patty, tasting like 100% beef, and you can specify what you want on the burger.  I do not like catsup, so want it deleted.  I was happy that they paid attention to that.  Their steak burgers are very much like Steak and Shake.

There is \"fries sauce,\" which is a mild 1000 Island tomato infused mayo and that can also come on your burger.

I had an issue with the salt-laden fries.  Shoe string sized they are perfectly cooked and are pretty much fresh out of the fryer.  BUT...they were close to inedible. Way too much salt.

I mentioned this to the counter boss and they suggested that I ask for the fries to be unsalted.  I interpreted from that answer that the fries I received were how they made them, so the customer has to decide.

Will be back to try their custard and other ice cream products.  Glad to see something new in Indian Land.  

I would suggest that you do ask for unsalted french fries.

May 9, 2018

Wanted to do an update but ended up in edit mode.

Wife and I returned to Freddy's.  Wanted her opinion.  She agrees with 3 stars A-OK with comments.

I did order my fries unsalted and they accommodated that request without comment.  Yea!

Each of us had burgers and both thought them good like Steak and Shake.  Iced tea was good, as it should be.

Wife had onion rings and they were not so good.  Greasy and out of a package.  Reminded me of the greasy glob one can get at JJ's Red Hots in Ballantyne.  Will give them a pass and recommend you do, also.

Discovered that their \"fry sauce\" comes in regular and hot.  Regular is a catsup/mayo mix and the hot is darker and contains jalapenos.  It really is not hot in the least and one would not know you had the hot upon tasting it.

Did try the custard.  Our airport driver told us that it was the best she ever had, so...

We split a cup of half and half, chocolate and vanilla.  It was very good, dense and tasty.  And it did not taste eggy, a common fault found in cheap versions of custard.  Highly recommend you dig into one of their sundaes as there are varieties of toppings and combos for the custards.  Yum!

For peak lunch time it was not crowded, so wonder whether people are voting with their feet already.  

Worth a visit if you want good burgers and excellent custard.  Just beware of the salt-laden fries...go salt-less and you can add regular or their season salts later."}
{"text":"Amazing frozen custard. I love and always have the Hawaiian delight. The Chicago dog is always so good, and their hamburger is very delicious and flavorful. Love this place. The service was fast also."}
{"text":"You can tell that these burgers are not frozen. The french fries are also good especially with their fry sauce. Great place for kids too."}
{"text":"Probably as good or better than the rest of the fast-food burgers around here.

I ordered the patty melt combo.  I like my bread with a little character, and this was pretty decent rye bread.  The burger itself, with the cheese and onions, was juicy and flavorful.  A different style from most burger places, I guess that's where the \"steakburger\" concept comes in.

The fries were tasty as well - shoestring fries, which I prefer.  I don't know why - maybe it's the fact that there's more fried surface area than normal ones, but these were just plain good.

For dessert - I have to at least try their signature dessert - I went with the turtle sundae.  The custard tasted pretty much like normal soft serve ice cream, and it was loaded with walnuts, with some chocolate and caramel topping.  Nothing really special, but it was pretty decent, probably as good as you'd get at DQ or Tastee Freez.

I'd say this is definitely a winner in the fast food market."}
{"text":"The food was good, so was the custard but I'll will probably never go back due to the price. I got a number 1, a kids hamburger which is 5.95, kids grilled cheese 3.99, 2 mini custard with m&ms and a medium custard with snickers that was just thrown on in a big clump. Total 28.99"}
{"text":"Freddy's is always a solid 5... never disappoints. Service is always very friendly, so glad we are lucky enough to have Freddy's!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this new burger joint in Concord Mills. We decided to take our lunch to go, because most of the tables were occupied. Short line, long wait, but they were busy so it wasn't too bad. There was a woman clearing table, and she overheard me reading Yelp reviews to my Wife. One of them mentioned the fry sauce, and the woman told us that it was similar to 1000 island dressing. I ordered a bacon & cheese double steakburger, as it was (mustard, pickles & onions). My Wife ordered a single steakburger plain with bacon. We split a fries and onion rings too. When we got home and opened the bag the onion rings were missing. I guess we should have eaten there. The burgers were ok, mine almost tasted like it had been pan fried a little too long. I didn't care for the consistency of the burger either, Alina thought it was fine. The fries are really thin, and were good when they were hot. Because we got ours to go, they had cooled off by the time we got to them (after sampling a few in the car) and they weren't very good anymore. Lunch for 2 (without beverages) was $17, kind of expensive for so-so burgers. 

Overall, we probably wouldn't go back again. There are too many better choices in the area, including 5 Guys and Steak & Shake."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I have to knock off a star from my other review.  I have been here several times.  The last time I went, it was a late Friday night, and I wanted a concrete.  I decided to go inside, we were the only ones in the place.  Didn't get that overly welcome feeling I always get when I come here.  I got the Turtle concrete and hubby got the M&M concrete.  When we came home, it was hardly blended at all!  The yummy chocolatety goodness, pecans on mine were at the bottom, same for the M&M's in hubby's concrete.  I told the cashier it was to go, but we got the overflowing cup and had to ask for a lid.  Not cool at all.  But, since it is tasty, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to an off night."}
{"text":"So I didn't even realize we had these in Vegas but glad we do!  I first had Freddy's in Orlando. I am mad for their custard the best!  I actually like the dogs I got in Vegas better than Orlando. So I will definitely return very soon!"}
{"text":"Overrated and our first time trying this place out. The prices were high for what you get. The double burger patties maybe equaled the size of a regular burger any where else. The steak burger tastes like regular hamburger. They forgot an order of our fries. We noticed when we were already home. I'd go again if someone requested but I wouldn't go here.  Smash Burger and In n Out are better"}
{"text":"First time hearing about Freddy's and it was good. I liked the burger and the shoe string fries were great. 

Good customer service and our cashier joked along with us when ordering. The food and value matched up. 

We ordered the California burger and double burger combos. I like the burger was messy, juicy and the meat was bigger than the bun. The special sauce reminded me of In-N-Out burger from the west coast. Sorry guys my heart is there with the special sauce. 

People seemed to be happy working there which is always a good sign, especially in fast food. Came out quick and hot. I did want extra crispy fries and they weren't as crispy as I wanted, just my preference. For a burger joint I would return."}
{"text":"This place is hell a busy, the staff seem very eager. It is the grand opening there is allot of staff here  make ing sure the tables are attended to . It's nice to see the economy doing well. The food is pretty good and they have a great selection of desert. The burgers are decent and I love the shoe string fries"}
{"text":"Burgers & Fries are awesome!!!!  Frozen custard is very good too!  Every time I've gone here....employees are always cleaning floors & tables.  Place is kept clean & in order.  Employees are friendly and check on you to make sure your satisfied.  Nice for a change!  Not one complaint about this place!  Clearly they have a great management staff!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a patty melt here because I wanted to compare it to the patty melt I just had the night before... from my hospital cafeteria.    Unfortunately for Freddy's, the hospital food actually won this time!  

My patty melt at Freddy's came sliced thinly with cheese and caramelized onions with the bread being a little burnt on the edges.    We also ordered a strawberry funnel cake, this place's definite saving grace.   I would go back when I have a funnel cake craving.

Little things about the service also detract a star from me.  For example, along with the kid's meal chicken nuggets, we clearly specified to have ranch dressing.  When we pick up our food, no sauce whatsoever.  

I'll definitely give this place another try sometime.   Due to their extensive types of burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why it's called a steak burger. There's no meat in it at all.......just some very porous fried blood about 1/8\" thick. The fries were nice and crispy the way I like them but they are so small if you eat them one at a time you'll be there awhile."}
{"text":"I love this place more so than steak & shake! Burgers are great and I love that they give my pup icecream  when we come through the drive through."}
{"text":"Great burgers the way they should be made onions pickles mustard cheese.  Fry sauce, fry salt outstanding.  Custard is creamy and outstanding.  Crushed ice in the soda machine."}
{"text":"Good ol' burgers. Taste homemade not like those chain restaurants. Fast drive through line and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Four stars for the amazing custard!!! Very flavorful custard and affordable price. I'm don't usually eat fast food but since this place is close to In and out, I feel like the burger needs to stand out for some more differentiation. The patty was thin and lacking in flavor, bread was flat and oily, and there was lack of lettuce tomatoes or onions. For those reasons I give four stars instead of 5. Without the amazing custard the burger itself is a 2.5-3 star."}
{"text":"What a waste of calories!

Came to this new location on a Sunday afternoon with my 12 year old son. Not my preferred type of place to have lunch but the boy wanted a burger so being the outstanding mom that I am I obliged. 

We were NOT impressed. It was VERY crowded in the small dining room to the point where I started immediately getting claustrophobic. It was literally shoulder to shoulder standing room and all seats were taken. We finally made our way to the counter and ordered. My son didn't want onions or pickles on his burger so I said  \"I'll just put them on mine, that's my favorite part!\" To which the kid behind the counter replied \"Those on on your Fish sandwich already.\" I said are you sure? He said yes. 

They were not on my Fish sandwich. It was very bland and a bit greasy. Very little fish and a lot of fried whatever & bread. A teensy dab of sauce soaked into the middle of my bun. Yuck. 

My sons \"Steak burger\" was paper thin and not very good. Neither were the straw Fry's. I can't figure out why this place is so popular!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My girl and I went on a Saturday night and to our surprise the drive thru was empty. I ordered a classic Freddy's double steakburger combo w/fries and a drink, and a pbc frozen custard. My preggo lady had a bowl of chili, a chocolate shake and a large fries( sounds like a pregnant cocktail to me). Came out to $19.30, kinda pricey but it was worth it. Their burgers are juicy and all the toppings including the classic burger bun were fresh to def. they gave us a lot of fries and we both ordered regular size. The fries were probably the best fast food fries I EVER had. Yeah I said the best I EVER had. The frozen custard was great as well, I'm not a big fan of FC but they made it amazing. The PBC had bits of choc. Chips and peanut butter and real banana in it. My girl couldn't eat the chili, it was to much for her, but she said it was great and I agree with what I tasted. Real homemade chili not any processed meat or sauce. I'll be back to Freddy's to try the Cali burger. Also ask for fry sauce, there's is amazing, homemade! And the service was fast and friendly. If You have a love for steakburgers, you will come here. Great place and personally I think in n out has some competition."}
{"text":"Not bad but reminds me of in and out. Burger is since it is thinly sliced and crispy. And fries are a hit since if is thin. That is if u like them that way. My kids just love them and fries alone will let me eat in peace and enjoy the burger. I can't really say anything too bad about it since its downright homely with the fried stuff. Not spectacular but certainly not bad if u want a quick fast food type food comparable to in and out."}
{"text":"Burgers were outstanding. Patties had a wonderful texture/mouthfeel and all the toppings were very fresh. I thought the serving size might have been a little small for what you pay, but you're definitely getting quality ingredients. The shoestring fries were very crispy and served hot, made to order. Spot on! I've gotten them to go as well, they're still good but definitely best eaten as soon as the order comes out (as with just about any french fry).

The custards and 'concretes' were great as well. Velvety texture with a great flavor. I got the turtle style concrete and my girlfriend had one of the ready-made ice cream sandwiches.

Restaurant is brand new, so unsurprisingly the place is clean and everything looks in order. The ordering was a little slow the first time around, but it appears they're still training several people all at once. Food came out perfect so no complaints there.

A great new chain for the area, looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting, The first time we went we were way to full to try the custard! The burgers we had were amazing! My bf hates mustard and pickles on burgers and he loved the original double burger! Also That jalapeno fry sauce is sooo good! We put it on our burger. The second time we visited we shared the turtle sundae and again we deffinetly Will be back! 2 visits and 2 homeruns in my book! 

Also the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely good.  WHY ARE THERE NO CUSTARD BURGER JOINTS IN L.A.???  The original Freddy's special with everything on it and fries hits the spot every single time.  

The service here is some of the most energetic and friendly that I've ever come across, too.  I mean, yesterday the owner himself was going around talking to people, making sure they were content.  You don't find that every day."}
{"text":"I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.

Burgers were very tasty and fresh.  More than a pleasant surprise, to be sure.

Custard?  I had the Turtle Pecan thingy, and it was awesome.  Just wish there was a larger scoop of custard.  The folks were nice, helpful, and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Tried the chili fries... its an all meat chili which was good because i don't like the ones that are full of beans. Also tried the chicken strips and frozen custard. Overall food was good. We didn't eat inside we went through the drive thru and the service was great and speedy. I still prefer Steak n Shake better."}
{"text":"Purchased a Freddy's original double burger combo substituted the soft drink for a Hawaiian Delight concrete. The drink was great! The burger was dry and the fries are horrible! These skinny shoe string fries are hard to chew, swallow, and get cold very fast, making them even worse! I suggest, since you serve steak burgers, why not Steak Fries??? They would be better quality! This is my second visit to this restaurant in Orland Park, IL. Im willing to try their Chicago style hot dogs, but the fries gotta go!"}
{"text":"I am disgusted with the fact that I had a metal object in my food! I am literally sick to my stomach and refuse to eat there again."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast!! Hands down the best fast burger spot anyone can ask for!! With every bite in the burger soo juicy and flavorful & fries so fresh and crisp. Staff super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This is a new location, and they are getting better as time goes on....  The drive thru is a little slow, but they are making orders as they are placed.  Inside, the employees are working hard to keep up with the constant line of people and orders.  Everyone has been very nice, and the food is good.  One night we waited 15 minutes for our food, and they provided us with free dessert coupons.  Give them a chance--they are getting better every visit!"}
{"text":"Lucky for us, Steak and Shake was packed so we decided to try out Freddy's....so glad we did! We ordered , got our drinks, and sat down to wait for our number to be called. It was a little longer than I thought it would be but still less than 10 minutes. The food is made to order. The crispy on the outside-juicy on the inside patties hit the spot. The fries were also delicious, crispy and hot. They give you an insane amount of fries! I couldn't finish them. My kids split the kids burger and it was perfect for them. We also had to try the frozen custard and of course it was creamy vanilla goodness. This is my new go-to burger place in the Concord Mills area."}
{"text":"Im glad I didnt have high expectations based on the 4 star average rating. I ordered the Double California Steak Burger Combo. It came with shoestring fries and a drink. The burger itself was not as big as I thought since there were two patties. It's about the same size as an In n Out Double Double, only In n Out's has a little more veggies. The patties themselves were a bit salty and just a tad overcooked. The fries were your average shoe string. The Freddy's sauce and special seasoning is what probably allowed me to finish the fries.

What is making me give them 3 stars instead of 2 is the dessert they are known for! Frozen Custard! From their menu you can have it either as a Sundae or Concrete (milkshake form). I ordered the PBC n B Sundae. Comes in mini, medium, or large. Im glad I got the mini cuz I could not finish it! The PBC n B consists of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, Sliced Bananas, Frozen Vanilla Custard, Whipped Cream, and a single Cherry on top. (refer to my pic!) They have other tantalizing flavors as well which is probably the only saving grace in coming back here.

Service is friendly as evidenced by the smiles and attention I received at the counter. Prices average about 7 to 8 bucks if you want a decent meal to fill you up. The overall size of the place is very spacious with enough tables and booths. The bathrooms are a nice size and is actually pretty clean.

Overall, its an ok burger place. For you peeps with a sweet tooth, the desserts will always hit the spot here. If anything, make this place as your go to dessert place after having dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't live on this side of town but decided to check it out since I was in the area. Very satisfied with that Steakburger! Amazing portions and cooked to perfection. My cashier was a younger white lady, Wasnt too impressed with her but as long as she makes me a GREAT burger im happy haha. Anyways, ill be back when im down on Eastern again. cheers guys"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here and hey, this place is good! The burger patties are super thin but very tasty and the buns, burger sauce and toppings were very good as well. No soggy mess or dry nastiness here! The drive thru took for-ev-errr and their fries and fry sauce are just meh. I fed them to my garbage can instead of my face. The burgers and concrete mixers are so very good though, I'll just get onion rings next time.  This place reminds me a lot of Culver's, but better!! Now if they could just get some tasty cheese curds on the menu..."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area. 

We did not care for the location we previously attended in Goodyear. 

We thought we would give them a try since its a different location. 

Service and staff were amazing. Friendly and went out of there way to make sure we were having a great visit. 

Food was great, was happy with everything we ordered. Dinner for 4 people with dessert was around $50.00 and we all left very satisfied."}
{"text":"One of my top 2 fast food burger spots in Vegas, side by side with smashburger. Better than In n Out. Really flavorful. Writing this review makes me what to go back for another. Drool."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, the Double Bacon Steakburger is my favorite so far. Burgers here are very customizable to suit your taste buds. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Only received a wrong order from here one time, however it was resolved with ease, and I received a coupon for the mix up. One time I received a free sample on their caramel turtle sundae out of the blue. All in all it's a well rounded burger joint. I Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our usual go-to fast food burgers are at Wendy's or Sonic.  But I noticed Freddy's on Yelp and we thought we would give it a try.  Well, next time it's back to Wendy's or Sonic.  The Freddy's burger was over-cooked and dry.  Mine was a bacon cheeseburger, and it didn't have much bacon flavor or cheese flavor.  The fries were fine, but no better than the typical burger take-out joint.  (One of the things that I like about Sonic is that they have tater tots, which I like better than fries.)  So my verdict on Freddy's is \"nothing special.\""}
{"text":"Tried them this weekend and i was rather impressed. The burgers were good, and i would definitely try getting something other than a single. Fries were tasty, and well salted.  Personally i prefer thicker fries, but at the moment the shoe string fries did the trick.The dining area was nice and clean. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and their menu was pretty easy to get thru. 

My wife had the custard and she said that it was great! One gripe is that they do not offer a No Sugar Added alternative.

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan. This was my first visit and I only got the #1 combo. It was all way too salty. My kid loves this place and all of my friends enjoy it as well. I do plan to give them another try...for the chili dog. At this point, 5Guys is still my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is or the draw to this place to be honest. Came here on a Tuesday night and it was packed. Mainly older couples, nothing against them, seeing as I'll be older someday, but the demographic was couples over 50 and large families.

Order a couple of regular burgers and some fries and fried pickles. Came out to about 15 bucks. For that price might as well go to Red Robin and get the lunch specials.

My burger was lacking. Flavor was just ok. Patty looked like it was a decent patty to begin with but in order to cover the size of the bun it was smooshed down. The add a slice of pickle which is cool if you like pickles. I'd recommend getting a double if you're hungry and want something satisfying. Fries were ok. I'd rather do In N Out fries all the way. They give you access to as much of the \"frie sauce\" that you want. My friend had the patty melt. It was ok. Meat needs more seasoning and the overall size was lacking. 

The fried pickles were by far the best part of the meal. We went ahead and got the vanilla concretes for dessert. Once again... just ok.

Good overall was 3/5."}
{"text":"The burgers are great. I do not generally indulge in fast food but my daughter convinced me to try Freddy's and I was very pleased. The turtle custard is awesome!"}
{"text":"I just went to the drive thru and ordered a chicken sandwich (lettuce-wrapped) and a six patty (lettuce wrapped) steakburger.

When I got to the drive thru, the associates could not believe that I was ordering a six-patty steakburger. They upgraded me to ten patties upon my request calling it the, \"Freddy's Challenge.\"

I took it home, although I told them I can eat it there. They insisted next time I come by. 

Pictures are posted."}
{"text":"Freddy's is fanastic!  My first ever Freddy's experience.  Prior to zooming on over to Freddy's I just had a small cup of gelato at Angel Sweet, prior to that I just finished up a great and filling meal at Big Buddha in Surprise RIGHT AFTER eating sooo much food at Surprise Stadium during the A's and Royals spring training game (some sort of bbq sandwich, french fries, ice cream, hot dog, etc.) !  What a great day topped off with some Freddy's.  (Hehe)

On the menu for two:
1.  vanilla custard with gummy worms (We originally wanted a mix-in but the lovely cashier told us that the machine was kind of iffy at swirling the gummy worms so he suggested a cheaper option of just getting it as like a sundae with gummy worms on top.  Helpful worker!)
2.  chocolate custard with almond mix-in
3.  chicago dog
4.  regular hamburger.. I forgot the name.. whooops
5.  patty melt

To be quite honest, for being famous for their custards.. I wasn't really feeling it.  Just tasted like a little more premium soft serve, but whatever.  Just not my style really.  Sweets are one thing, but a good 'ol greasy savory thing of meat is definitely more appealing to me in the first place!  Chicago dog was great.  Burger was great.  Patty melt, also great.  

I think I first found Freddy's online at the mall's website.  Freddy's is actually not inside the mall, but just right on the outside of it next to the movie theatre in a stand-alone building.  Clean looking facilities.  Great service!  Shout out to our great cashier for looking out for customer's wallets.  

Oh and also, they have one order pick-up for the desserty custards and a separate one for the hot food!  Definitely would want more Freddy's if it were available to me!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place out since it opened. I ordered a  double cheeseburger combo. I love the shoestring fries and the sauce. The burgers are like homemade patties. Not that frozen round patty from other places. The patties were seasoned just like the fries too! The drink comes in a reusable cup, so it's like a souvenir! I'll definitely be back! Oh there drive thru window opens from left to right, not right to left so don't pull all the way up...lol"}
{"text":"I go here 2-3 times a year and I'm always reminded why I dont come here more often. Overpriced.  Slow service.  Waited 20 minutes for 2 burgers and a fry. No drink. $14.

Concrete chocolate brownie is good. But its $5."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype on this place, went for the first time last night.  Ordered a single to split which is what I do everywhere and the meat was reminiscent of \"where's the beef\"  I could see through the supposed steak burger.  The frys were great and staff was very good and it was clean ant eh milkshake was to die for but to have to order another single to split was something I do not do anywhere else, they need to uses more meat and not require the purchase of a double.  Also MSG sends me up the wall and by 9pm I was UP THE WALL so I am assuming they use a lot.  And with so very many people allergic to nuts and tree nuts why not have a separate area and frying bin for them because it eliminates those people from going there.  If they are that successful that they do not have to worry about the allergens I wish them luck , my daughter is highly allergic to tree nuts and I texted from there to stay away, which means where she cant go I don't go. Amazing, people worry more about gluten than a death causing allergin.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"I've had Freddy's about 3 times now. I did not like their burgers at all. I;ve tried them differently each visit and thought there was nothing remarkable or unique that made it stand out from other burgers. Their custard is pretty good... rich, thicky and creamy but again not mind blowing. Only thing I thought was really good were their fries. These are crispy, well seasoned, shoe string fries and they are great with some of their fry sauce."}
{"text":"Kind employee, wrong prices on drive-thru board, overpriced (over $6 for their basic burger), super greasy meat, soggy bread, didn't try the fries because they're shoe-string and I'm not a fan of those in general. 

Bummer, since I live very close by, but I'll continue going to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"My friend told me she really liked the fries from this place so I decided to try their burger and fries. To me, everything was too salty, even for a fast food place. I did like that the burgers were thin and the fries were thin and crispy. I will give this place a try again; perhaps the cook on this day just went overboard with the salt."}
{"text":"We have struggled a few times with ensuring the person at the register entered our order correctly, just double ch can the screen. No biggie, they are young teens, super friendly who try hard and are getting great work experience and they have a great work ethic. The food is always delivered fresh hot and correct. Their Sundaes are Amazing!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is delicious!  Burgers are tasty and the bun is light.  The thinly cut fries dipped in their \"fry sauce\" is oh-so-good!  Plus it's super convenient being next to the Harkins Theatres."}
{"text":"So far so good. They were quick, friendly, and accurate. Can't ask for much more from a fast food joint"}
{"text":"I love the food but I have never got what I ordered. I'm not sure how hard that is.  I don't have the time to order and wait twice. I give up"}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, frozen custard - oh my!! Deliciousness!!

Their burgers are fresh and yummy! Always made just the way you want them! 

The fries? To die for!! I'm not really a big french-fry person, but the shoestring fries here are too good to resist!

My kids got the t-shirts and get free frozen custard every visit now.. Kat, who's the manager there, is kind enough to remember us and told us we didn't need to drag the shirts in each time. We are so spoiled by the wonderful service and warm hospitality. 

You can't go wrong here. We go almost weekly (even getting lettuce wrapped burgers on my healthier visits ;))."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I was nervous because of the reviews stating that custard is the only reason to come here, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
The food was delicious. The burger is thin, which gives it a nice crispy texture and their special seasoning makes it savory. The fries were amazing. We always order extra crispy fries but they have perfect thin crispy fries that don't need to change at all. 
The service was awesome. Very friendly people at the register and the grill. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great steak burgers and addicting thin fries!! 

I found Freddy's purely by chance when I decided to make a \"burger run\" to Vegas from San Diego via motorcycle. Departing  SD at 0530, I pulled up to Freddy's at 1025 just as they were opening.

I was invited in by a very friendly manager and discovered a very clean restaurant with abundant seating and a delicious looking menu.

I finally chose the limited edition, spicy jalepeno and onion ring burger. I addition, I selected a soda and fries. The customer service was great and my order was quickly delivered. The burger was hot and juicy and perfectly prepared and the fries...pure fried goodness...try them with any of Freddy's sauces...you won't be disappointed! 

Now, I'm not suggesting everyone head out on a 350 mile ride for a burger (and then turn right around and head home) but if you find yourself in Vegas or anywhere else Freddy's has set up shop . . . it's definitely worth checking out. 

Next time I've gotta try the frozen custard!"}
{"text":"Took the kids for burgers. They said the burgers taste like Steak and Shake Burgers. 
They have what i called \"shoe strings\" French Fries, they are good and hot. They have 3 different dipping sauce for your fries, my favorite was the Freddy's Special sauce. I had the veggie burger in which i was not a fan. It was just OK. 

Inside reminds you of a 70's cafe. Staff was ok, no \"hello welcome Freddy's\" but they was kind. 
There is also a drive. 

I like the fact that they have ice cream with a LOT of topping options!!"}
{"text":"We figured we would try them out, since they are the new kids on the block. The business is super busy so that's usually a good sign.

I mean who doesn't like steak burgers. It's smells pretty awesome as soon as you walk in. The fries are the tiny cut ones, and they packed with flavor. The burgers are well prepared.

Other than the wait or the lack of seating this is a really nice spot."}
{"text":"This place left me with a really good first impression. The burgers are the bomb! The patties are juicy with a well-seasoned flavor and have this nice crisp around the edges. The interior is clean with large booths and ample seating. Much nicer ambience than your run-of-the-mill fastfood joint. The custard was good but not the best I've had. Nevertheless, it's a nice finish to the meal."}
{"text":"I know Freddys is an acquired taste for some but I really enjoy the food there. The burgers are good, the fries are great and the custards are delicious. Get the fry sauce, its really good. They have season salt and two different fry sauces. I prefer the Jalapeno one than the regular but I lile a little spice in my life.

The staff has always been friendly for each of my visits. The location is always clean and has a 50s dinerish vibe. It is a bit confusing on how to turn into the parking lot but not that confusing. 

Officially, they have a 10% discount on Monday for the military but they usually give it to you on. Any given day."}
{"text":"Okay, so I know this seems to be a great place to others and I'm not dissing what they had to say.

I'm just saying my personal thought on my experience.  Went here for the first time ever after seeing they just opened.  I got a single steakburger while the hubby got a original double, no fries, and a plain chocolate double scoop dish.  Total price just under $12.  

Let me say that now I've tried Freddy's I'll just go across the street for McDonald's McDouble and drive back across the other way for a Wendy's frosty for less than half the price.  I only say this because the food tasted exactly like these or worse.

Not very original tasting.  I would go to Smashburger, Culver's, In-n-Out, and Five Guys before going here again.

I saw someone also got no lettuce on their burger.  I also don't know if I missed something, but our burgers came with pickle, onion, and mustard.  It tasted.....boring.  The custard really, really, really just tasted like a thicker Wendy's frosty.

I gave an extra star because the food seemed to be of fresh ingredients which is a good thing.  But I have had better.  This just didn't stick out as WOW to me.

Also, don't park around the drive thru.  We went through the drive through and the line blocks several cars from trying to get out.  People had to wait a long time.  Park more in the southern area of lot. :)  I also agree with another who posted......let's get an In-n-Out on this side.  Then I think we will have all the burger joints, too!."}
{"text":"One of the worker had his partner and baby by the fountain drink area. He was touching his kids snot then going back to work. His significant other was wearing pj covered in animal hair. I thought it was gross."}
{"text":"Leaving North Carolina and kids wanted to eat here and I must say it was worth it.  The restaurant was clean and the people were friendly. The food was fresh/hot and out in a timely manner.  Hamburger was delicious and they even made a spacial salad upon my request. Wish there were more of these in the South (South Carolina)"}
{"text":"Freddy's fries are bomb! Would've never expected a fast food joint boasting frozen custards to make such a mean fry. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, all packed into a little shoestring morsel of happiness. And they have a signature fry sauce to elevate it to the next level- definitely try the spicy one!

Fries aside, our turtle concrete was a tad disappointing. It was way too runny to be considered a concrete. Received it half melted, and by the time we got halfway through we were left with a soupy mess. Still pretty tasty though! Can't really go wrong with any caramel/nut combo

Clean restaurant, gourmet menu items, and fast and friendly service makes you forget you're in a fast food place. And in such a convenient location as well! I definitely will to come back to try their burgers and hatch chile dogs"}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here. Thank you to the young lady for taking care of us! Always a great place to eat & get desserts!"}
{"text":"This place underwhelmed me. The frozen custard was really small and sub par. The  staff was friendly and kept the place clean. But the food was below  average."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a few times.  I noticed the sign said steak burgers.  I have never heard of this burger and custard place.  I went on an adventure with my friend Google to do some research.  This is a Kansas based franchise chain.  It was a Sunday night and we decided to assemble the family and try this place out.  It was pretty packed but we didn't wait in line very long.  They have hamburgers and hot dogs.  I ordered the original double and my wife got a hot dog with the chili cheese fries.  We got my daughter a grilled cheese.  The order came out pretty quick.  The service was great.  the dining room was pretty clean for this place being so packed all the time.  I was bummed out that it was a Pepsi establishment, but that just my individual complaint.  They do have Dr. Pepper though.  Overall the burgers were good.  It didn't blow me away.  I think there are better burger places out there in the same price range.  This is definitely worth checking out for lunch.  The fries did disappoint by themselves.  I ended up eating some of my wife's chili cheese fries.  If you get the fries don't get them without toppings.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I got my hair cut at Roosters, and those folks told about this place because the owners at Freddy's were smart to invite the neighboring business around them a day before this open to a free event.    To business owners, this is a very smart idea, because you have a attentive client who listening to them for at least half hour....but just remember to win them over, which Freddy did.

Freddy's got it right with their name, and it's all about Custard, and Steakburger.    I forgot to bring my carb blockers, but doubled up on fat trappers to tackle the #7 combo of a double steak burger with Bacon.     Ordering was painless, but watching the them put together a Hawaiian blended custard was painful...it's looked pretty killer!    

My order was done in four minutes, and I was very happy with the appearance of my burger.   It had a caramelized finish like the old snoop burgers ( I really miss that place)   but I was not too happy with the old bacon, but what the heck, the burger was done right.    These folks nicely season their burger while it's cooking, and this what separates them from Steak n Shake.  

The manager does take his rounds in the dining room, and checks on how your doing,    I always feel this what makes or breaks a new business, and listening to your customers feedback is going to be your biggest tool for success.    Good luck Freddys,  you're on the right track."}
{"text":"Greasy goodness.  Don't want to eat here if you are watching your weight or being health conscious, but boy does it taste good.   The fries are very addicting and the service was pretty fast and friendly.  Just thinking about the fries as I write this making me wanna drive over and get some."}
{"text":"Everything was real good and delicious. Only thing that didn't make it a 5 star experience was the fact that they didn't have any spicy peppers for my tasting. Other than that great place to get a burger."}
{"text":"Last night, after wasting 15 minutes of our lives at Bachi Burger,  my friend insisted we try this place out, since it's in the area and we've driven by it alot.

Even though the place was quite busy, we were greeted immediately within seconds of going thru the door(literally!). I've got to say that for a fast food place, I was very impressed with the service recieved here. Everyone was rediculously nice and friendly.

After reading the reviews, I had somewhat lowered expectations. Alot of the reviews compare Freddy's to Steak N Shake, which is fair to a certain degree. Living near South Point, I've been to SNS many times, and Freddy's burgers are definately a notch better. The burgers I had last night had a lot more flavor than the burgers I get at SNS, but than again, you will pay a bit more here too. The prices aren't as bad as I had heard, but for 3.19 for a single patty and 4.29 for a double, they aren't exactly cheap either.

Still, though, I really like this place. The great customer service really goes a long way with me. I will definately be back.


4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is ok to go nothing to crazy special than other fast food chains. Stick to the burger and hotdogs I had a beef sandwich and it was not good at all. The fry sauce is ok nothing out of the ordinary.  The fries are like tooth picks and have a good flavor. The lady behind the counter did come up to me and give me a free ice cream. I would come back but would go cheeseburgers all the way."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't even go on. For the price this food is fantastic. I had patty melt and fries. A turtle Sunday. I'm so loving everything I ordered. There is 6 of us at one booth. Tons of room. Great service."}
{"text":"Really good burger chain, a lot like culverts and smash burger mixed together with a slight in n out feel. Burgers are really good and there fry sauce is the bomb, even the jalapeño fry sauce is amazing, the only problem I had was that the fries didn't seem to be as flavorful, there wasn't really any seasoning on it"}
{"text":"For a \"Fast Food\" style place Freddy's really impressed me. The food was tasty, the service was friendly and fast, the only thing I can even think of nitpicking is the open tables were a bit dirty but there was an employee there to wipe it down before we could sit down. 

Into the regular rotation for sure."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place so I agreed and went with her. In my opinion, the burger was on the greasy side. Their French fries were tasty and had good seasoning along with the Jalapeno seasoned dipping sauce. Other than the burger patty was bigger than most fast food burger joints, it would be a good idea to drain the fat or grease before serving them on a bun.

I still think In-N-Out burger or even Smash Burger is still better than this place. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious! I decided to write this after waking up from a Freddie's Food coma. The remnants of fry sauce and what I believed to be a splotch of chocolate concrete laid smeared on my shirt. 

Now for those of you who really enjoy a burger, good fries, and a chocolate thick shake you will be familiar with this type of food driven debachary. 
Their burgers are not the traditional type. They are a bit heavy tasting for this lady. I am an \"In and Out\" burger fan so this is your heads up. The burgers taste like they are cooked on a grill then flash fried in something that resembles fair food. (You know! You go to the fair and they fry just about everything. Twinkles, corn dogs, and things on sticks) 
The French fries are amazing! I told my son that a rainbow riding unicorn just ran into my mouth as I shoved in a crispy delicious fry. He  just stared at me in stone cold 4 year old flare said,\"I don't even know what that tastes like! At that point, his dry humor was oblivious to me because I was gorging myself on the chocolate heaven known as \"the concrete.\"
Holy custard chocolate, marshmallows, and whip cream mixed within a thick heavenly delight. BEST SHAKE like desert EVER! My 4 year old entered into a chocolatey dirt and worms trip that must have been good because his face was smeared with chocolate, gummy worms and Oreos. He passed out on the ride home after emptying his bowl.

Don't even get me started on the fry sauce! It's like magical sauce made in a magical place by small little fairy like creatures! I occasionally follow the 5 second rule but not with anything liquid... HOWEVER... I have now made an exception to this policy for Freddie's fry sauce. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Shhhh  don't tell but I had Frozen Custard treat and it was very rich and tasty . I can tell you from my wide range of ice cream tasting ability that my frozen Custard was chocked full of rich butterfat.   I might go back to try there burgers but I know I will be back for Custard.  If you like culvers you will enjoy Freddys"}
{"text":"Stopped by after my flight - never been here and I was too tired for anything but fast food. 

I had Freddys original double - basically a dbl cheeseburger with pickles and onions, no lettuce or tomatoes. It was pretty sloppy, fell apart fairly easy, but it wasn't bad - tasty. The fries are of the shoe string style- a little bit bigger maybe, but nothing to go back for.

I would probably hit the In N Out next time, but this wasn't bad. The only thing that bugged me a bit was the drive thru was empty, and the dining area was fairly slow but it still took a while to get my food - maybe they were short handed...I dunno."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The nostalgia is real! The 50's-60's tunes makes it a feel good place. 
The service was friendly and fast. 
I had the double burger California style combo which came with fries and a drink. The food was fresh- made to order. The burger was delicious. The burger was cooked perfectly, crispy on the edges from the flat top. It was almost like having bacon on my burger! Amazing! 
I also ordered the Hawaiian concrete- custard with pineapples, strawberries, coconut and macadamia nuts all mixed up like a blizzard topped with whipped cream and a cherry on top!

Definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food burger and fries! Honest burger with crunchy pickles fresh onions. The shoe string fries are awesome with the seasoning. You can add seasoning when you pick up your food at the counter. On top of the great food, the service is awesome for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Needed a milkshake and every other ice cream spot within the vicinity was closed! So I found Freddy's on Yelp and decided to give it a try. If you like your milkshakes incredibly thick... This is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Steak burgers are awesome along with the fries and custard, it makes the perfect quick meal for lunch or dinner. The general manager has been there every time we have eaten inside and goes table to table to make sure everything was prepared perfect. Definitely the best place to go for quality burgers and hot dogs anywhere in the North Charlotte and Concord area."}
{"text":"The service was awesome..because they were making my burger fresh the staff feels a lil obligated to talk to u in the drive thru...interesting.  I told them I'd yelp...welp here ya go..the burger was great even tho I asked for grilled onions the raw ones were good.  I hate skinny fries...that is until now...yours were pretty good.  I'll be back.  Gotta try the custard huh?"}
{"text":"Just a tip for the store/franchise owner. When your team member can't hear what your customer is ordering through the drive thru, please don't tell them to say,\"you need to speak up!\" That to me comes off really rude and disruptive, especially when they're shouting back at you. 
I'd prefer a more calmer and pleasant approach like, \"I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Can you please repeat that?\" And maybe we'll raise our voice just a little so you can hear us better. If your intercom can not pick up normal talking decibels, then maybe that is what need improvements."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this chain new to Champaign and was pretty disappointed.  Although the food wasn't horrible it was ok and extremely over priced.  My burger looked like that had literally thrown it together from 3 ft away. Their worms and dirt concrete was pretty awesome.  Staff was rude as well, won't be going again, I can get better food, service and value at Steak 'n Shake."}
{"text":"I been to this place at least three times now. I can only write a review on one item on the menu because every time I go there, I get the same thing. Why? It is because I am in love with that burger and I can't let it go. =)
My favorite at this joint is the number #6 combo, double steakburger california style (you can request grilled onion and with or without cheese) with drink and fries. The steakburger is tasty and juicy. The fries are thin sliced and crispy, perfect way to eat it. The drink that I always get is the passion fruit iced tea, I like the flavor and taste of the passion fruit. The only negative about this iced tea is that it's warm, I had to put a lot of ice just to drink it and a little sugar to add a little sweetness to it."}
{"text":"After greasy foods.. this place will rock my stomach..here for my frozen custard.. overall its good.. been to the one in Victorville.. will be back.."}
{"text":"It is difficult to give a fast-food burger joint five stars, so I hesitate, but my family would easily do so for Freddy's.. 

Freddy's was easily worth a second visit. On the first trip I had the double California and it was very good, my wife had a single steak-burger. The patty, although slightly thin,  has some nice char which we both really enjoyed. My son had a hot dog and he said it was better than Nathans. He gave it 5 stars.The bun is loaf style, buttered and toasted. The thin-cut fries were excellent, and we used the special sauce for dipping which was far better than the usual ketchup. The meal ended with a shared Turtle Sundae which was first-rate and very tasty.

The second trip called for a Patty Melt, it was delicious. The onions were perfectly grilled and tasty, the bread toasted and buttered. A nice meat to bread ratio. I added some of the Freddy Sauce and it made the sandwich even better. The meal ended again with a Turtle sundae.

The price is reasonable along with an ample menu selection to warrant future return visits. I would not say that Freddy;s is better than Two Guys, Smashburger, In-n-out, they are all on the burger radar, but Freddy's offers a great alternative and excellent custard creations for dessert.The dining room is large and has a welcome ambiance, the self-serve drink station, Freddy's Sauce & Ketchup dispenser are a welcome change to tearing open 10-15 small packets plus the amenities are well-done. The staff is helpful and friendly plus eager to answer any questions.

The only reason to go to Micky D's is if you only have a dollar in your pocket."}
{"text":"We have gone here many many times. My kids love it and we love it too. The food is great, always great service, clean, fast and the custard is very good. My only complaint is I'm not a huge fan of the old fashioned music they play rather loudly. However, my son loves the music so I guess it's just me. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Overall, above average experience so feel more like 3.5 stars, but hard to move it up to a four star.  Went with wife and two kids.  We order double burger california style, large fries, kids hamburger and kids grilled cheese.  

Value - The burger was similar to Steak and Shake even down to being able to see them smash and grill the burgers on the flat top.  Cost for the Double California Style was $5 and change without the fries.  With the fries and drink I believe it would have been $7.50ish.  One could get the same things at Steak and Shake for $4 plus cost of the drink (probably $5.50 total).  The quality of the Steak and Shake burger IMO is better.  The burger uncalifornia style looked to be about $.50 cheaper.  The $0.50 is definitely not worth it for a couple slices of tomato and lettuce piece (like one gets from a salad bar).  HOWEVER the fries (shoestring style like Steak and Shake) was a HUGE serving size, twice or 3x what is provided by Steak and Shake.  My $2.10 large order of fries was a heaping basket loaded with fries, enough for me and my wife and still have leftoevers.  The side of fries were also very generous (again 2 to 3 times what is given as a side at Steak and Shake).

Custard - We got a large Dirt Concrete snowstorm ($4.99).  Kids enjoyed and my wife and I thought it was on par or maybe a notch below that of Culvers.  It was not as milky and rich as Culvers and several notch's below that of Kopps.  The lack of a flavor of the day also makes it less interesting as a custard restaurants.  The ingredients looks high quality and saw giant tubs of Reese's syrup.  Saw a custard making machine, so looks to be made in-house.

The fry sauce appears to be a mayonnaise based sauce and went well with the fries and good on the burger.  The spicy (jalapeno) based sauce was far better than the regular sauce.  Will probably return when I'm in the area for the custard, but better food options in the area."}
{"text":"Birthday girl wanted to celebrate her 9th at her favorite restaurant. Introduced Family from out of town to Freddy's too. All 8 of us enjoyed the delicious Food!  Fast and Friendly Service as always! Birthday girl felt very special with the Wonderful wishes from  the employees. Thank you so much for making this very special for her as well as all of us."}
{"text":"Freddy's has the best steakburgers and patty melts in the country. Their milkshakes and ice cream products are delicious. I was pleased to discover that this small chain recently opened in my son's town, Fairfax, VA."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: 50's style, shoestring fries requires their fry's sauce, yummmmmmm.  Delish burgers and the Oreo Custard Cookie. 

Frozen Custard you might ask?  Smoother texture.  Just like ice cream  but made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar.  Ah la gourmet as if it was hand churned, much richer. Smiles all around. :)"}
{"text":"I think the food is great - especially their fries sauce. Their sundaes are delicious as well. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because a couple weeks ago I went to the drive thru and the girl filled up my soda and handed it to the guy to hand to me and he said to her how it was too full because it was actually spilling on the lid and he proceeded to hand it to me anyway and it overflowed out of the lid big time and all over my pants. I had to hand the soda back, ask for napkins and then wait a good minute before they even handed me some all the while with freezing cold soda all over my pants. They apologized but just was very turned off spending $15 to have my soda all over my pants. Accidents happen but he saw it overflowing on the lid as he handed it to me. Easily could have been prevented or comped a sundae. Chickfila forgets to take off your tomato and you get the meal comped - awesome customer service there."}
{"text":"I LOVE steakburgers!  And thank you to my Yelp app for this find!!!  If SoCal wasn't so saturated with burger places, I think Freddy's would do very well due to how good these burgers taste! If you haven't, look up a steakburger recipe and give it a try yourself! 

Anyways, located in Henderson next to Sunset Casino, Freddy's is visible on Warm Springs Rd.  Walking in, we were met warmly by the staff, and got our grub promptly. What I liked about Freddy's is their small menu, and they have combo options to include eating a hot dog with your burger if you don't want fries.  They also serve various custard desserts and milkshakes as well. I have always been a fan of the concept of being AMAZING at a few things on a menu then being average and/ or crappy at 100 things (taco bell UGH).

I give their steakburger 5 stars.  Seasoned perfectly, not too greasy, and it's made somewhat plain--it's on you to tell them what fixings you want on the burger.  The size of the burger is perfect in relation to the price, and we were very impressed since this is fast food. French fries were hot, and we were just happy as can be! 

I think there is more than one location out in the LV area, so if you are in town give Freddy's a shot!  Thanks!

{"text":"Shanna (sorry if I didn't spell it correctly) was so welcoming and helpful.. and funny :) great first time visit and it won't be the last! She let me sample both custard flavors. Yuuuummm.. I picked the Vanilla it was great.. oh we also planned to share well she split the meal for us.. I didn't know people did that thanks!"}

Food was delivered fast and looked exactly like the menu pictures this never happens... special thanks to Lamar and Santana  for making this a super experience.....the pride that is shown by the employees here should be an example that all service industry needs to work by.   AAA  5 STARS FROM US"}
{"text":"The service was very nice. They messed up my order at the drive thru gave me a burger instead of the patty melt but I received an extra burger out it. So that's a plus. But the Patty Melt was very greasy and messy probably because they had to rush to get out my order and the fries were lukewarm. Not terrible but definitely not worth $9."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, wife loves it because of their hot dogs. Burgers or steakburgers as they call it, is pretty good. This location always have a great environment, and is always clean.    Seems like they are always busy and always have a lot of high school kids working there, so patients is needed at times.
Now for their hot dogs:
Wife likes them, buns are buttered toasted. Dogs are a all Vienna Beef hot dog. And they are pretty good.
Steakburgers are actually very good, they look very thin, and smashed. But the flavor are very good. Should at least try them!
Our experience has always been positive, and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I also work right by Freddy's. I have eaten here many times and the burgers are great! I also love the thin cut fries, not a fan of steak fries, etc. The custard is great too.

If it werent' for Lenny's I'd say best burger in the valley. But sorry folks, Lenny's is better in my opinion. I'd call In N Out a distant 3rd."}
{"text":"I don't come here often enough and I'm kicking myself in the butt because of it. Just had the Cali burger with green chili and onion rings. My god. The chat on the burger is excellent it really sets itself apart on that alone. Just like in n out they use way too much onion but hey to each his own, I still inhaled it. Also had a hot dog with sport peppers, the Texas toast hot dog bun with buttery grilled yummyness slayed my whole entire life. Soooo delicious. I'm obsessed. The dining area was clean and they have wifi for the guests, also my phones gps is odd but I was able to hit up the freeds pokestop wile munching on shoestring fries (all the reviews say they're legit, it's true) so was even able to set up a lute and caught a charmander. I am not mad. Lol great place, great food. Need to come here more!"}
{"text":"Austin took our order and he was really a great help. Everything he suggested was amazing. My first time eating there was a success I loved it."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and they keep up on keeping tables clean.   Employees are very nice and helpful.   It's shoe string fries, so if your like me and like those, they're great.   If you like thicker fries, you probably won't like these.   They're onion rings are also very good.   Burgers are very greasy.  They are ok but great.   My tummy paid about 5 minutes after.   Custard is average. Overall it's a normal freddy's greasy but ok.   Clean but kinda small inside and drive through line is always packed and slow."}
{"text":"okay soooo I hate ice cream and everything that comes with it...but when it comes to Freddys custards its a musttttttt before leaving Arizona! Its amazing beyond amazing! Always welcoming staff and great food. Simple and clean."}
{"text":"First timer and have to say it is yummy!!!! This is what I imagine a 50s diner burger would've tasted like. Now all I need is a chocolate shake but decided on the Dr Pepper. Great flavor and great service!"}
{"text":"I went to Freddy's and got into the drive thru at 9:59 and they didn't answer until 10:02 saying that they were closed even though there were still cars in the drive thru and we got there before the close time. I'm highly unsatisfied with Freddy's"}
{"text":"Food is ok, I prefer the custard.  Service is pretty decent they're always coming around to make sure everything is ok, asking to take your garbage & cleaning the tables."}
{"text":"The food is about what you would expect from a steak burger restaurant. The meat is a little on the dry side, but the burgers are still tasty. The fries have barely any salt on them, but I prefer that over them being over-salted. I have not yet tried the custard items, but I will.

My only real complaint is that depending on when you go the place can be very loud and crowded."}
{"text":"Wow. The slowest fast food ever. Waited 40 minutes for food.When we get to the window she hands me our ice cream and we wait at the window for like 12 more minutes as the  Ice cream is melting.  Total wait for 2 burgers and fires and ice cream 45 minutes. Ice cream is totaLLY melted. Not sure how long it sat before we got to window. And price is ridiculous for OK burgers."}
{"text":"I think In n' Out has met its match, but one step better is Freddy's. I had the Double patty melt, it was fantastic, my wife had the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich it was OK, not fantastic, our friends had the Double Steakburger California Style also fantastic. The Shoestring Fries and Onion Rings were great. But wait dessert!!!! Signature Turtle Sundae (1133c) with creamy vanilla custard, hot fudge, hot caramel, toasted pecans, whipped cream & a cherry and Hawaiian Delight Sundae(850c), creamy vanilla custard, pineapple, strawberry, coconut, macadamia nuts, whipped cream & a cherry on top. Three different size sundaes, recommend to start with the mini-sundae, unless you plan to share, then go bigger. The regular size was a lot of sundae.
I'm back in California, going to find a Freddy's in my neighborhood.

{"text":"Favorite burger, chili fries, and hotdogs! Service is fast and consistent, already can't wait to come back. 

My only complaint is that the fried pickles aren't very good, stick with their shoestring fries"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger in the city. Seriously considering going back today for more. I just wish they had a quadruple burger. 

The burgers & fries look like Steak & Shake...BUT the taste is so much more robust. Not overbearing. The buns go great with the patties and the fries were done just right. Not overcooked like some thinner cut french fries tend to be. 

I'd recommend this burger joint 5 times out of 4."}
{"text":"Usually this Freddy's is great- but it's gone downhill. My burger was cold and service was terrible. Disappointing coming from such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great tasting steakburgers and delicious frozen custard...My fav is Hawaian Delight Sundae or Concrete (blended)"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but the portion sizes are way too small for the price. It's kind of a rip off for the price."}
{"text":"What am absolutely horrible experience. I went through the drive thru to grab something fast. I will not be returning to the location. I was the only one in the drive thru, and after waiting 15 minutes for my meal, I finally went inside. I tried several times to get employees attention while in the drive thru, but nobody ever responded. Once inside, I waited another 3 minutes for my food and when I asked why it took so long, the employee said she needed to get the manager. I continued to wait, and when the manager finally came to speak to me, his response was that \"this never happens\". End of the day, I waited almost 25 minutes to get my meal."}
{"text":"It's like eating in the 70's. . . Has awesome Custard, and it's original. I am not  a fan of the burger * the patty is not my style * but it's still tasty. . . The hot dog was a  normal hot dog, but it's like something I would cook at home, so it's got that comfort food feel to it. I enjoyed the home feeling from the employees, it's a joint that serves up some fast food. I don't often eat at these types of places, but it was for a good reason, and im glad I did."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the frozen custard. I had brunch earlier and driving by couldn't resist my fave crave-custard. Really good and flavorful wasn't expecting a huge cup when i asked for 2 scoops but not a bad thing right? I devoured it all. 

Burger review next time."}
{"text":"First timer here. we ordered our custards and had eaten half of them when my friend found a long black hair nestled in his. They made him another, but neither of us wanted to eat anymore. The manager did refund our money. thus the two stars."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in line on a Friday evening.  Their burgers are a little unique and while I liked mine, I've had better.  They have shoe string fries, which I'm not a fan of.  I thought the meal was priced well at around $9 for my combo meal.  And the staff were all polite and friendly. But afterwards we decided to try a mint Oreo concrete mixer. We purchased 2 small size and they were$4.59 for a small!  When I received the order the smalls looked like junior size, so I asked if that was really a small that cost $4.59?? It was true...I thought the mixers were way over priced for their size.  Taste about the same as a dairy queen blizzard."}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru today.. staff didn't seem too happy to be there today. Food came pretty quickly. I like the fry seasoning but feel like meal portions are small for the price."}

Atmosphere: Attractive!
The red decor definitely stimulates my appetite. There is a modern yet classical feeling with this restaurant.

The cashier answered all of my questions promptly and gave me a few recommendations as it was my first time on the establishment.

Food: Disappointing
The burger was not flavorful. A very generic find for a burger. The fries, although fried nicely, had no flavor nor seasoning. Their house sauce for fries did not contribute much to the experience, either. Not a bad price for the quantity of food, however.

Summary: Good for a quick bite
I weigh many of my restaurant reviews on the food. Unfortunately, the make or break of this chain was the food, which in my personal feelings, broke the review. Nice place in a nice location, however. Stop by for a quick bite, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Not a happy customer! So I've been dying to try this place out for quite sometime. I was craving a delicious burger with bacon. So i ordered the double bacon and cheese steakburger with only one patty. Just got home to see i got a burger with pickles no bacon or anything else.... Really? I should've kept the other patty because what they give you is a joke. I got cheese fries which were ok probably because i was still hungry after eating my bread sandwich. What a waste of money. Next time ill stick with smash burger or in and out. This place us way too over rated!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a first time for us, we were in the area and decided to stop in and try it out. 
It wasn't crowded at all, we must of just beat the lunch rush 
The staff was all so friendly and welcoming made us feel special, haven't had a great service like that in a fast food restaurant in such a long time  they even came around to check if everything was ok .
My wife tried to jalapeño burger, she requested no sauce, I was afraid it would be to dry for her but she said the burger was juicy  she loved it! 
I got the double California burger   I loved the shredded lettuce in the burger I know that's something weird to appreciate in a burger but the shredded lettuce holds the sauce better in my opinion , I also loved that the meat patties were smashed. 
Also the fact that they have shoestring fries  gives me life 
All in all we are happy we made a great choice and look forward to return"}
{"text":"I've never had such a crappy meal.  If there wasn't so much screwing around by the employees, maybe our meal would have been better.  And to think we drove two hours for this nonsense."}
{"text":"Wanted to give a shout out to Aaron. Great customer service and very friendly. He made our time at Freddy's very enjoyable.Thanks Aaron for the wonderful service.

The steak burger was awesome and really enjoyed the chocolate ice cream with brownie concrete ."}
{"text":"Had the patty melt. I am a patty melt snob and they did not disappoint. Our First time here and we really enjoyed the food and service. French fries were skinny, crispy, hot and delicious. Wish they had coke products. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love Freddy's!  We have been there 3 times since it opened and love it.  The first time my kids ate their entire burger and my daughter ususally doesn't heat burgers at all.  On our 2nd visit they did give us the wrong order but quicky fixed it and checked on us 2 times after."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger and i was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. The fries however I am not a fan of.. some were stale as if they just mixed old fries with the new ones.. I might give this place another shot but honestly there are so many other places I can go to for a veggie burger."}
{"text":"I just ate at Freddy's for the first time. We've always seen it every time we come to Vegas. I'm so glad we waited to come this location. Danielle took our order. She was AWESOME! She helped me customize our order. Different cheeses, onionsstyle buns etc. I loved that she is  still loves the food and her job.

 The patties on the burgers are lunchmeat thin! But have good flavor. All and all it was a good experience.

Thanks Dani for the recs!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! It is very nice and comfy.

Their custard is amazing! I definitely recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"Creamy creamy creamy! Perfect place to satisfy any ice cream craving! Many topping flavors to choose from. Burgers and fries here, too!"}
{"text":"I drove through. It was about 9:40pm. It was late. I was hungry. I ordered a Triple Steakburger and a Regular Concrete. The sandwich stank so bad that I thought there was literally manure in my car as I drove home. When I arrived home and ate it, it was still hot, but the patties were fried to a dry, grizzled crisp. No flavor, no juiciness- just crunch and tasteless carbon residue on a former burger patty. Worse still, this \"triple\" was supposed to contain a slice of cheese per patty, which I'd asked for. There was one bad tasting cheese slice.

The concrete custard cup was decent, but actually somewhat less frozen than I'd normally expect.  Still it was at least tasty.

I won't be returning. Next time, I'll choose Wendy's or something else. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had to average this experience out. The Vanilla Frozen Custard alone is 5 stars incredible! I tried their other known items to fellow Yelpers and well I just don't get it??  A total PASS on anything else. I had the burger and it was so squished, dry and salty it was not right. The burger itself had no flavor other than SALT. It was extremely disappointing. Visually it was also unappealing. The meat is super odd and creepy. 
I also tried the shoe string fries and I couldn't even eat it. It was way too salty and visually salt throughout. YUCK. 

The ONLY thing worth it at Freddy's is their vanilla frozen custard without toppings. I think my 3 star is being gracious."}
{"text":"When I was in college, my roommates and I would play video games. A lot of video games. In between ditching classes and playing Halo: Combat Evolved on our super rad LAN parties in the dorm rooms, we would eat (because most humans require food to operate and we required food to operate our Xbox controllers.) The choices in the small town weren't plentiful, we had the choice of the student union, chick-fil-a, Wendy's or a little place called Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers. You see, chicken sandwiches and square patties got old after a thousand times, but something about Freddy's steak burgers and their thin patties hit the spot in a way the other chains couldn't. I'd like to say that many a study sessions were fueled by these delicious burgers, but I didn't study, studying is for nerds. 

Long story short, Freddy's on Eastern is everything I remember from college and is a welcome addition to the Vegas fast food scene."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Skip the burgers and fries, get the awesome tenders instead. Unreasonably expensive for the quality of the food, however.

Looking for a place to grab some food for finals studying, I was pretty bored of the usual offerings and decided to give Freddy's on Warm Springs a try. Service is friendly, drive-thru times were reasonable, a tad on the long side.

The food: I ordered a #7 that includes a double bacon cheeseburger, fries, a drink, and I also ordered a large chicken tender with bbq and ranch. The cheeseburger wasn't very good, the overall taste was bland and I didn't like how the cheese low quality (wasn't melted at all in some places). I was really disappointed as I was reading reviews while waiting in the drive thru.

The fries were also forgettable and a pain to eat. They're all in a million little pieces about 1 inch long each. Maybe I got all the left over fries? Fry sauce is just mayo and ketchup with a larger mayo ratio, which is gross. The soda was flat too.

I was disappointed in the price too...over 15 dollars for a combo and tenders? Come on.

I really, really liked the chicken tenders. I wish I would have gotten two orders instead of the burger! They were piping hot, and the sauces were pretty good. They give you brand name sauces which I thought was neat. The tenders were juicy and weren't 'cardboard'-y like other chains. Not rubbery when chewing and they breading was nice and crispy. I liked it! I definitely wont be back for the burgers but if I'm in the mood I'll definitely order some more tenders!"}
{"text":"This chain reminds me alot of Culvers. How could you go wrong with burgers and custard?? This place sets itself apart by adding gourmet hot dogs to the mix. Plus the burger meat is different. Instead of beef patties, you get flattened steak cuts. I wasn't used to the thin sliced steak patties but it tastes pretty good all the same. 

I really enjoyed the oreo dirt custard. I now have an excuse to enjoy oreo dirt cake, but of course, this time instead of cake, it's a mix in for thick, creamy custard. 

The interior of this fast food restaurant is more fun than Culvers since they take the 1950s vibe pretty seriously. It reminds me of being inside a 5 and Diner.

Overall, I like coming here as a lunch alternative to regular fast food joints. It's definitely worth trying at least once to see all that they have to offer,"}
{"text":"Upon entering Freddy's I was plesently greeted by the staff with hellos welcomes and how may I help you. The establishment is very clean with plenty of space. Menu items run around $8 USD for a combo.

THE FOOD:  I decided to order the A.1. Chophouse double Steakburger and my girlfriend had the Pattymelt.  The fries were really great. They were thin cut and cooked crispy with a remarkable seasoning.  The fry sauce seems to be a thousand island blend.

THE BAD: The Chophouse was a mess. The buns were soggy and the burger was over seasoned. I wasn't impressed. The patty melt was equally a mess. The melt was not even properly on the bun with barely any cheese  in it.  

OVERALL: Clean place friendly staff, made me feel welcomed awesome fries.  Burgers were nothing special"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was impressed! Good menu and options. I had the melt with cheese fries! DELICIOUS, honestly my new favorite burger place. My boyfriend had a triple he loved every bite. Love how thin the patties are. We also had onion rings which were good. I love the jalapeño fry sauce I put that on everything! We also ordered 2 regular custards Togo which were amazing too! The staff was very friendly and even took care of our tray, which was very nice considering how full we were. The portions are big for what you pay. We will definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu! Please come to Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the #7.  Bacon and cheese double steak burger, fries, and drink. 

Folks, I am in a burger quandary here.  I may have to move up Freddy's over my beloved Fatburger because it was that good.  

The fries are insanely good.  Why?  Super thin cut shoestring fries that are nice and crisp.  They are not shy on portions either.

Fast service in a packed location.  Nice job Freddy!"}
{"text":"Burgers and frozen custard are staples. The hot dogs are top notch!"}
{"text":"I'm 41...been to a grip of burger places in my life. This is it, my favorite ever. Sad cause I'm here on vacation and there aren't any near my home. Anyway, best ever.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting my brother. It's sort of like a steak and shake but better. Service was not super fast so allow some time but food was really good. 

I had the double patty melt on rye with fries and also ordered the Chicago dog. 

1) Double Patty Melt was awesome. Piping hot and perfectly done it has 2 beef patties with grilled onions cheese and on rye bread. Get it. 

2) Fries were good but just good not great. In all fairness I don't like shoestring fries. The jalapeño fry sauce was great. 

3) Chicago dog was loaded with flavor. Tomato, pickle, and peppers on a toasted bun. Super!

To end it I went with the nutter-butter ice cream sandwich.  Very good. 

I say try it. Better than steak and shake any day!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The workers and food is awesome! I love that they offer a veggie burger as well"}
{"text":"First time visit to a Freddy's, but I was not disappointed.  
My husband got the classic double steak burger with fries.  I stayed with cheese fries. 
If you love fries, go to Freddy's. They are shoestring fries!  
The general manager, I believe his name was Chris, was super attentive in bringing  over food and then when we were ready for custard he made sure to tell us the process for getting it after the meal. 
Now the custard is the reason for five stars. This stuff was so good!  I had a Reese's Concrete and the hubby had some dirt and worms. Best custard ever!

It's in a weird plaza that you don't know it's there until you've passed it, but it's worth the turn around!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but can we work on how you present food to your drive thru customers? Just throwing a burger in a box it is too small for means it will slip and slide and become a mess before the first bite.  Wrapping a burger in paper helps prevent it from becoming an unmanageable dripping mess after the first bite. Others do it, why can't you?"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Freddy's, I am always thrilled to be here for the staff, who are the greatest bunch of young customer service stars in town. I could not care what they serve me, they are warm, helpful, happy, and professional. 
But I do care about the food: excellent burgers, fries, oh so good onion rings, amazing black bean burgers, and of course, frozen custard.
The bean burger is seasoned nicely and has great texture. It has great fresh onions on the sandwich. I prefer to order the applesauce as a side, versus fries, for a healthy option.
The staff always check on you and they bring you extras you may have forgotten.
I really like that they support community schools and other organizations for fundraisers.
Freddy's is clean, reasonably priced, friendly, and while I have been here a dozen times in the last year, I did not review until today, for some reason.
This is our go-to meeting place when my husband and I are in different parts of town.
Sit in the cheerful restaurant, or drive through. Either way, I hope it becomes your favorite fast food place, too."}
{"text":"My first time here. Very busy at 1 pm. 
The onion rings were greasy. Tasted
Like oil was old, needed to be changed.
 Sundae was good. Not enough employees to serve the amount of customers. My give them another try in the future."}
{"text":"Got a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut French fries and a drink. The hot dog is really good and well-cooked and goes really well with their toasted bread which substitutes for hot dog bun. The French fries were really good as well as the fry sauce that they sell. There Sundays are also very smooth and if you get a brownie the variation in texture is a pleasant surprise to the palette I have been going to Friday's for a very long time and they have not disappointed me yet"}
{"text":"I believe that if the Pilgrims and the Indians had tried the Pumpkin Pie Concrete from Freddy's there would have been less scalping and more smiling. 

Yes, I did it. I ate it and loved every sinful bite of it. I did it for America and for Thanksgiving really. Now on that special day in November instead of sitting around a table with my family pretending to LOVE that kind of food I get to be home, alone grubbing on Thai takeout which I enjoy so much more. I might even eat it in my bed, and not shower and drink my Thanksgiving away. This will lead to several explicit drunk texts I will knowingly regret the next day, but my friends will be entertained. Yup, that's how I will give thanks. 

Back to the hotel...I mean the concrete. Charlie Brown would even agree it's the Great Pumpkin.  If you dig pumpkin pie at all they shove the whole shabang in there including the soft crust, pumpkin filling, nutmeg, whipped cream and crop dust it all with cinnamon. You don't have to wait until November to give thanks. Do it for your country and sweet tooth today and grub on this goodness!

Warning: You will look bloated after so don't eat one if you plan on wearing a slutbag Halloween costume right after."}
{"text":"Went back last night with the girlfriend to give it one more shot.  Lukewarm french fries, and again, I was not impressed with the burgers.

The people that work there are friendly enough, but I guess I am just not a fan."}
{"text":"I regularly visit Freddy's in other cities and consistently like the ice cream and fries in particular. However, this specific location was only ok. The shake I got was not well mixed and seemed somewhat melted when I got it. The service was very quick and the kid at the counter was funny and friendly. He is a good hire. We got our order quickly delivered to the table by the same kid. However, the general order taking process must not be well managed because every few minutes another order was mistakenly brought to our table (not by the aforementioned kid) and we probably told the staff 5+ times in the 20 minutes, while we ate our order, we were there that the order wasn't ours and then the employee would look around confused and call out to find the customer whose order it was. Very confusing. Other Freddy's has order numbers that are given to the customer for display on their table. By far the best part of this experience was the kid at the counter who was funny and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here on the hottest day of the year. Seriously delicious. Kindy pricey and the chicken was a little plain but the hot dog was delicious and the California Burger is better than a Double Double. (Sacrilege, I know) the fries are tiny shoestrings that are delicious."}
{"text":"Why is it every time I get the patty melt the meat looks like it's been whacked to no end and it's burnt to a crisp and taste like leather  I wish they would stop making their meat so thin and then burning the hell out of"}
{"text":"This place makes terrific burgers.  The fries and the ice team are just ok for me, but the burgers are great.  Restaurant was clean and the staff were polite.  Food came out quickly"}
{"text":"Nice little burger place with my son loves the custard. Staff is very friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place at least once a week, the reason I don't anymore is simply because I don't head down to Henderson like I used to, but I was a customer there from the first day they opened (literally) until June 2017, and they never disappointed, if there was a mistake on the order which happened once (they'd fix it no problem) and you can even order shakes on stand-by and pick it up when ready and you avoid the line. Keep it up #FreddysWS"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place along with the food that makes it better than other places is their passion, they genuinely care about the customer and have at times acknowledged birthdays with a treat! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love the cheese steak here. Super cheesy and loaded with peppers and onions. It really is messy so don't ever try to eat it while driving in your car or you will most definitely hate life. The fry sauce here is amazing and rivals chick Fila sauce and they will give yah extra for free if you ask. The peanut butter chocolate milk shake was incredible as well so give it a try."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Hopefully because it has only been open for a week.  Inside is very disorganized when trying to order and the noise level makes you want to go outside.  The Patty was paper thin  and beyond well done and lacking flavor.  Onion rings were so so . Decided to try a sundae and again was just average.  I think the prices are way to high for the quality. Seems like they tried to rush to open because it was lacking any leadership.  I would wait for awhile I'd you decide to try."}
{"text":"Great classic style atmosphere. Food was fast and hot. Employees were enthusiastic  and friendly. Family loved it and I'm sure we will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"My son absolutely loves this place!!! He went Sat and Sun  ... we go here at least twice a month. I go for the custard ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim today and was glad that I did.  It was nice that there were vegetarian options, and both myself and son ordered the veggie burger.  It was a black bean burger with actual piece of black beans, and it was very good.  The fries however were awesome.  Of course you can't have them with the fry sauce. 

The staff was a very friendly.  Not only was the cashier helpful and nice, she carried out her tasks with a smile.  The lobby attendants were very attentive, asking several times if we needed anything, and even held the door for us on our way out.  

Really nice lunch experience."}
{"text":"After taking my mother to her doctors appointments, we drive by this place over & over again. My mother loves chocolate custards & asked me to stop & grab her somethin.  So of course I did, this was my first experience with \"Freddy's\"... Didn't really expect much, but was pleasantly surprised. Ordered my momma a basic chocolate custard in a bowl, and myself a Chicago dog (Freddy's version) extra sports peppers of course! After paying realized Momma might enjoy a topping on her chocolate custard, asked how much for Almonds & not sure if they are free, but the cute girl working the register through them in for free! (Gotta love that) Also decided to order some frys to go with my Dog.. Soooo glad I did, the seasoning on those skinny fried taters was Amazingly tasty! The \"Freddy's version\" of a Chicago dog was pretty good too, hard to compare any Chicago dog to a Real Chicago dog, but would order there version again & Momma LOVED the almond covered chocolate custard... Overall very pleasant experience, will definitely stop again!"}
{"text":"American Food and Treats

I am not really the burgers and unhealthy foods type too much so this place I can see the appeal of to those who really go for that...

I just didn't find anything that exciting or exceptional...

Solid 3 stars means you will probably think it is good... It will probably not blow your mind though..."}
{"text":"Very good! Service was very friendly and answered questions without any problems. The burgers are old fashioned burgers with great crust and remind me of food from the past. They were served very hot. I loved  them. The custard very smooth and creamy. We had a concrete and a sundae and loved both. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The vanilla custard here is delicious, very rich and flavorful. I ordered it as a sundae with hot fudge and peanuts. I love that they serve whole peanuts not chopped.  I ordered a small sundae and it was a very decent size!  I also had a hot dog with sauerkraut and mustard. It came on a toasted buttered roll YUM!. Now I know why this parking lot is always full."}
{"text":"They just opened this location and it's close to where I live so me and the boyfriend decided to try something new. We pulled up and ordered the Patty melt combo and the burger/hotdog combo and a side of chili. When we got to the window the girl took our debit card and disappeared for a while. When she came back she apologized and said in the middle of our order the computers crashed and would we mind waiting so we said no problem. We waited a good fifteen to twenty minutes and the people behind us gave up and drove away. The manager came to the window and apologized and offered us a free pint of chocolate custard and some free frozen coupons. We waited a few minutes more and she came back and said they were going to comp our entire meal for having to wait so long. Excellent customer service and we were anxious to see how good the food was. We got home and dug in, everything was delicious and hot/fresh!  The shoestring fries are yummy and don't fill you up too much like other fast food joints. Their chocolate custard was on point as well. We will definitely be coming back!!! Thanks Freddys!!"}
{"text":"Its a cool old school spot great for kids and family"}
{"text":"Like a steak and shake. Good fries. Mediocre oreo ice cream bar."}
{"text":"Freddy's is similar to Steak and Shake only in the fact that they are steakburgers. Freddy's is delicious but the burgers need to be just a bit thicker as sometimes you can see through the meat patties. The flavor is addicting though and their bacon is thick and crispy and tasty. I like the tiny fries but they get cold too quick. The fry sauce and seasoning is a must on the fries. The portion is good for the price. I pay about $7 for a single bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink and sometimes I pay another $.80 to add a green chile. They don't charge extra to grill your onions either. The staff is always very friendly and the service is fast. They will come by and bus your table for you as well."}
{"text":"Why people are so high on this place is something I don't understand. The food doesn't stand out in any particular way while costing more than it really should. I think 3 stars is a generous assessment when considering the mediocrity of the food combined with the above-average prices."}
{"text":"Sigh. 
Another visit, another disappointment. 
Hubby and I went there yesterday after returning from a long car trip. Since we had a good second experience we thought this would be a good choice for something fresh, hot and quick. 
Well, it was all of those things but the problem was in the details. 
The food was overcooked. The burger, which before was at least flavorful was cooked so long it not only had no juice but had some black charred spots that were not tasty but tasted a bit burned. We also ordered the onion rings. Again, overcooked. They were crunchy but not in a good way. They had been cooked so long the onion, which should have been a tender and a warm soft counter to the crispy outer batter, had become itself hard and crunchy. Some parts of the battered outside were approaching the dark brown you get just prior to turning black. I would have preferred funyons. 
I really want to like this place. I really, really do. All I can think is that the owner is not on site or hasn't trained his staff well.
We were there at about 5 pm, what is normally rush hour. There was only one car ahead of us, so maybe not so rushed. 
May or may not go back."}
{"text":"Went to this new location for the first time and it was also my first time to go to a Freddy's restaurant. I grew up on Steak n Shake so I figured this would similar. I was correct. I chose to walk in instead of use the drive thru. I was greeted promptly and didn't have to wait long in line. I noticed the place was packed for about 2pm so that was a good sign. The lady taking my order was professional and paid attention to specifics I gave on my order. My food came up about 5 minutes later. Food was hot and fresh, everyone was professional and it's reasonably priced for the quality you get. This isn't some McDonald's or Burger King type of joint. Expect quality meat, better tasting food and more professional attitudes than other fast food. With all of that comes a price where the burgers average out to be about $3 a piece or more depending on what you get but it's definitely worth it in my opinion. I'll definitely be back to this location based on the experience I had."}
{"text":"Food here is always good. Hot and fresh. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. They are the mini Chick Fil a when it comes to service. Their custard is delish! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate here today with my kids and their friends the kids loved the French fries and the food was good, the fry sauce is good, I had a double patty melt is was good with the fry sauce I put on it"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I asked for catsup and salt in my to go order.  Was not provided to me.  Then when I opened the sandwich box I had a chicken sandwich not the burger I ordered.   Went back through drive thru.  Explained the problem. Asked for no special sauce on the burger.  I was told to drive around to the front and wait.   When it was brought out it had the sauce on it that I did not want and was missing the onions.  What a mess.  Last time there."}
{"text":"Great hamburgers and yummy fries...but that doesn't compare to the 5 Star service.  From the front counter to the bussers.  Always pleasant and service oriented.  I would go here just for the wait staff that cares!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"If you like Steak n Shake then you would be better off sticking with them. Same burgers same fries but at a higher price at Freddie's and YOU do the work."}
{"text":"Ok, so today was the first time ive ever eaten here. For burgers I usually prefer 5 guys, Smash Burger, or Fat Burger but Freddys is great. Also the shakes are hella good."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! 

They have steak burgers here!! I have to say not many places offer legit steak burgers but this place sure is trying to make a statement with its whole operation and the flow of things! Definietly one of a kind! If you have not yet checked out a Freddy's, you really need to! I didn't try the frozen custard this time, however I would like to visit them again here in the very near future to try it!"}
{"text":"I love their party melts and be sure to get heir fry sauce with their classic shoestring fries"}
{"text":"We came out to visit family who live out here in Las Vegas from Victorville CA hungry at 10:30 at night food was great manager Scott even came out to check on us to see how our food was... This place is excellent as the one in Victorville. Oh yeah veggie burgers are to die for and the custard ...well you just have to try it to explain it.. Love love love this place this franchise has got it together down to the Tee. Employees are friendly welcoming and treat you like family. Right on! 5 stars if you haven't try this place yet you will very much get addicted."}
{"text":"My son and I had driven by this location a number of times and decided today to give it a shot after church as we visited around 11:15am today and we both agreed that it was underwhelming to say the least.  

We arrived before the lunch rush as it was about half full at the time and only a couple of people ahead of us in line, so we checked out the menu while we waited.  We both decided to go with the #1 combo and my son went with chili cheese fries as his side and added a Dirt Worm Blizzard for good measure.  When it was time to order, we let the cashier know it was our first time there but she seemed to be less than excited to be there (definitely didn't give off the happy to be there Chick Fil A customer service vibe at all) as she asked what we wanted.  

After placing our order, we received our number (they announce order numbers over a loudspeaker) and went to get our drinks.  We opted to sit outside as inside was pretty dirty (more than a few tables were not cleaned which limited seating options, floors were very slippery with grease on them, trash was on tables and floor and flies were abundant).  Flies were in full force outside as well, and unfortunately the overhead fans were out of order, so we ended up eating in the back trunk section of the SUV.  The food wasn't bad, just blah.  My son did say that the blizzard was really good so that is a plus.  We also agreed that the shoestring fries were also very good.  As far as the steakburgers go, they were the definition of underwhelming with about as much meat as there was flavor (not much of either).  

Overall, we both agreed that while we were glad we gave it a shot, between the less than clean inside seating area and the underwhelming food, we probably won't be going back as there are just too many other 3+ star choices within 5 minutes of the area that it doesn't make sense to go back to a place that doesn't have the basics down, as being that dirty after being open less than an hour just wasn't very appealing to us at all, as you know a place is failing in that regard when a 10 year old points out how dirty they are inside!"}
{"text":"FROZEN CUSTARD? HOLY CRAP THIS TASTES LIKE ICE CREAM!

Actually...I dareth say, it was better than ice cream. Though I also heard a nasty rumor that it is healthier too. Anyway, down to the review - I had the Dirt n' Worms - vanilla frozen custard with oreos and gummi worms. The custard was so good, you don't even realize you're not eating ice cream! I'm definitely coming back to try the food."}
{"text":"ByOnce again I slapped with deliciousness. I can not stress the importance of the\"kiss\"when doing anything. Keep it simple stupid is just not a cliche. Sizzling tender steak patty onion pickle mustard on tasty bun is the only way to find zen. Slender fries and fry sauce you can't beat. Hush now we shall not speak of dessert for it sinful think of such thing!  I suggest you stop your doing make haste for they are waiting for you!"}
{"text":"Toasted Coconut Concrete with Vanilla Base. Period."}
{"text":"Best Fries Ever!  

I was driving by Freddy's and decided to go to the drive-thru and try their food for the first time today.  I've never heard of this place before, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I ordered the #5 (Original Steak Sandwich and fries with a drink).  

The drive-thru was a little slow (slow enough that I noticed, but not so slow that I got frustrated), but the customer service was great.  The guy in the window was super nice and quick to hand over my food when I made it up to the window.  I decided to try a few fries on my way home and WOW!  Perfectly crispy, salted just right, and not at all oily.  They didn't even need ketchup!  The sandwich ended up being just okay, based off others reviews I may have to try a steak-burger next time.  

Overall, very satisfying and I will definitely be going back for more of those fries!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a patty melt in years! It was just as good as I remembered! Love the skinny fries and they have Dr. Pepper! Next time I'll bring my kids!"}
{"text":"This place is great for some fast food and frozen custard.. great dessert,  good menu , and yummy! I mean I really can't find anything wrong with this for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service, food is not bad. I personally like bigger cut fries."}
{"text":"Wow, really good custard.  Love, love, love it.  

The burgers are pretty good too.  Don't let their thinness fool you, they are filling.  The fires are kinda a pain though.  Their so skinny, they are hard to pick up and dunk in ketchup!  

Sizes of the drinks and ice cream items are small.  But lets face it, do we really need all of those extra sugars?  However, given their size, I would have liked to see lower prices.  Matter of fact, prices are the only reason I can think of that this place didn't get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid. 
Uber thin burger that tastes like liver with plastic cheese topping.

French fries were ok, but small on portion."}
{"text":"We really liked this place!!! Food was good and workers her are very nice!! Will come back soon!!!"}
{"text":"So I was really skeptical since every review here was complaining about this locations service and taste, but I've never had a steak burger. This one is located on eastern in the same parking lot as office depot and krispy cream right in the center.  Can't miss it!  We went the drive thru option and ordered a double cheeseburger and single cheeseburger for me and shared a chili cheese fries.  The man was nice enough to tell us that we could have it with the  mean instead of having 2 fries.  Super fast, super friendly so I'm guessing the other yelpers just got unlucky or was also giving an attitude. As for the food,  OMG super good chili cheese fries with a great portion size.  And they distributed it evenly through the fries.  I hate when people rush and make my food lopsided. The steak burgers was an interesting style since they ate squished flat to cook faster and we order the original not the California style. It didn't taste like those fake McDonald patties which I can't stand.  I'll try it the other way next time.  Overall,  I will return for the chili cheese fries soon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and dessert on a busy Friday night, first time trying custard which was creamier than ice cream.  Burgers we're good and refreshing to have shoestring fries and onion rings as an option.  I love the classic diner feel and the staff was friendly and provided good customer service.  Despite it being a busy Friday night our experience was great, would come back to try again!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in years! I mean wow! I ordered the #4 the hamburger and hot dog combo and from first bite, I was in love. Even the Oreo ice cream cookie was perfect. I'll def return and I'm bringing everyone I know."}
{"text":"Average food. Slow service. Over-priced. 

I come here during the days I don't pack myself a lunch for work - which isn't very often. The food is good, however sometimes when I order my chicken tenders the meat doesn't look all the way cooked. Customer service is very nice, but even during their slower hours the food takes a long time to come out."}
{"text":"Ordered a California burger!  Won't be back.   Over priced over cooked. Meat is almost paper thin  had to hunt for the lettuce!   2 burgers 2fries $$18.55. Way over priced for the crap they served me !   WONT BE BACK. NOT EVEN IF IT IS FREE !!!"}
{"text":"I was soooooo excited when I saw they were converting the old Long John Silver's into a Freddy's! Freddy's has always been a treat for us on our road trips to Utah and it has been so great having their delicious burgers and shakes here in the Las Vegas Valley. The burgers and fries are always reliable and delicious.

I actually came back and edited my review to add that 5th star. I come here all the time with my friends from work. Always friendly service. Always delicious burgers and fries. Nothing like having a reliable burger joint right down the street!"}
{"text":"Took our niece there after a trip to the zoo. Never been to a Freddy's so i thought id give it a shot. Walked in and there was one family sitting eating already, one guy in front and a lady that came in after us. We got up to counter and I saw that a 16 oz cup of frozen custard was $6.49 each. WTH $6.49? Better be gold in it for that price. But we ordered two and sat down, awaiting our order. 20 minutes later nothing, i walked up to see why i had not received my order considering the lady behind us in line already was eating her hot meal. I stood for a couple minutes while waiting for help while they all ( including the manager ) were in the corner watching something on one of their phones. Finally manager comes over by that time i just ask for a refund she says ok and i say even the lady behind us who ordered hot food got hers when all we were getting was two frozen custards! She said oh and then said my money would be back on card tonight. Worst customer service ever! Needless to say i will never be back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been to a Freddy's where the staff was rude! We walked in and stood at the counter for 2 minutes before anyone addressed us and they only address us because I asked a question as to who was working the counter. The girl who took my order was rude! The food was amazing as always.
 
 An hour later we came back because my daughter was upset that we went to Freddy's without her. This time we went through the drive-thru and they were rude in the Drive-Thru as well! It must just be the store on Bell because I've never experienced something like that at Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Had the single cheeseburger and hot dog and was impressed. The burger was a bit different from what I'm used, but surprised me by how delicious it was. The fries were crispy and hot. Will come back here again."}
{"text":"These burgers are always good. Love the service as well as the skinny fries. And the fry sauce is yumm. My kids like the desert as well. Good place for a quick burger, fries, shakes and sundaes."}
{"text":"So this might sound a little crazy but I just found out this place has the good iced tea (you know fresh brewed and hint of flavor) It is hard to find the good iced tea in a drive thru! 

So far I've only had the Patty Melt (no onions) and it is really good. The sign is a little misleading. It kind mashes you think you are getting a double burger, but the steak burger patties are quite thin. Still very flavorful and it ended up being enough for me, but I'll need to double up if ever ordering for the bf. 

The girl St the drive thru was great. She informed me of what came on the burger, basically allowing. We to customize (remove onions, please) I ordered a combo with chili cheese fries because why not? And she also reminded me that they came with onions. This place lives their onions! 

Small issue, when I received my order the chili cheese fries still had the onions on them... Luckily I was planning to devour them on the Way home, so I was able to easily go back through drive thru. The girl was very good about making me a brand new order. She insisted that I keep the other order. All and all pretty good meal/experience... I'll definitely be back for some of that drive thru tea!"}
{"text":"Good burger, clean restaurant and fast excellent service. Heavy appetites should order extra meat. The fries are crispy, tasty, but once again I do not like those shoestring/angel hair french fries. We ordered our food and sat down, but within a few minutes a tidal wave of diners came in and the line was huge, but to the credit of the crew the line vanished within a few minutes, they got their routine down! When we were done someone even came by and took our tray for us! The prices are very reasonable too, just over $10 for both of us (we shared our fries). We'll try the ice cream and shakes next time. Good place good place!"}
{"text":"First thing - they are on Country Club not Arizona Ave.   Arizona Ave is in Chandler south of Elliot.  Second,  just don't bother.   They are over priced.   The burgers are tiny and the custard is extremely unremarkable."}
{"text":"I do not care for samll thin burgers or thin frys, but I love Freddys. 

The #1 combo is great. Double burger with cheese mustard and pickles and onion frys and a drink. (Mt Dew)

The people there are cool, the place was clean, and the food was good. 

Custard is 10x better the yogurt or ice cream. It is also worse for you...muah."}
{"text":"They have shoestring French fries and (the old Arctic Circle) fry sauce.....need I say more!!
It was good, the service was great and he place was very clean. I had the #4 which included regular cheese burger, fries, chili dog (I wanted to check it out).  The use long sliced dill pickles which I really liked on the burger. The chili dog met my picky expectations...it was on a folded toasted piece of bread...but was very good.   I will definitely be back.... :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I went in for dinner and the whole entire staff complimented my hair. I felt so welcome and at home at this store. Whoever is the manager should give the employees a pat on the back. Food is delicious as well"}
{"text":"Probably the best fast food burger I've ever had! Quick and responsive team, hot and delicious food, and a clean comfortable dining room. Very nice addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here is amazing. The onion rings are the best I have had in a long time. Centrally located in Henderson. Definitely worth the short drive to get there."}
{"text":"Frozen Custard is a MUST try! Whether it's a pint or a sundae, it's never a disappointment because their thick, creamy and flavorful plain or mix-ins. One of my favs is the Hawaiian because strawberries, pineapples, coconut flakes and macadamia nuts are great mixture. The burgers are different from patties, but good. They are drier and thinner due to being smashed grounded steak meat. Not your usual thick juicy patties used to eating, but flavor is good. Just don't expect to get fully satisfied with the meal, especially when the fries are the thin shoestrings. Room for dessert then!"}
{"text":"For a fast food burger joint, they are just great.  Delicious burgers.  Tasty shoestring fries and fry sauce.  They have probably the best fast food onion rings you can find.  All that plus frozen custard for dessert.  Also, they keep the restaurant very clean.  It's several years old, but looks almost new.  We're fans."}
{"text":"Wow !!!  I think their steakburger is the bomb.  Love this place.  And I love the shoestring french fries.  PLUS, the frozen custard is great too.  You can't go wrong here.  Just wish one was close to where I live."}
{"text":"For being fast food, this place is great...I honestly haven't tried the actual food, but the frozen custard is rich and delicious.  The chocolate is really chocolatey and the mix-in options are great."}
{"text":"This place was great. Came in here with my girlfriend, first time here. Ordered our food and sat down. Waited about 10 minutes, not too long. Got our food, and OMG it was really really good. Even though it can be sort of pricey (combo for their double comes out to about $8 something - not incredibly pricey but up there). The big thing I'd note despite the price, you're definitely getting quality for what you're paying for. We loved the burgers. Their french fries were good but a little too small (took me forever to eat each one and I started stuffing as many as I could into my hands). 

After eating our burgers and fries, we decided to get some custard. This was also amazing. I got the turtle concrete and I'm not sure what my girlfriend got but they were both really good. Not much of a complaint but I wish they were a little on the more affordable side.

Hands down this place is up there with In N Out, The Habit and Bakers (Bakers is a California company). Will definitely come here again!! :)"}
{"text":"**Read entire review...it is a positive review** :)

There is usually a line when we go (always use the drive thru). For the most part, they provide great service and delicious food. The 2nd to last time we went though they gave us cheese fries when we ordered cheese curds for my combo. Then the cheese curds that came with my boyfriends combo looked like he got a half serving size.

We didn't realize any of this until we got home. I called them and the manager on duty apologized. He took my name and address to mail me free meal vouchers. I was astonished that they arrived in the mail just 2 days later. I went back a couple days ago to use the vouchers. When I got to the window to pay and handed my vouchers, the woman called the manager on duty over. He rang up my voucher. Asked what was wrong with our last visit, and verified that this time there would be no problems. He thanked me for coming back and wished me a good evening. 
 
I felt like a VIP customer and really appreciated that they went the extra mile to make amends. 

I always order the patty melt and my boyfriend gets the number 1 (double hamburger). The cheese curds are so fresh and delicious. They make that sound when you bite into them. Yum!"}
{"text":"The hamburger patties are thin (so get at least a double) but they're delicious! The Chicago dog is great too. But the fries are as addictive as crack! These incredibly thin fries are probably the best I've ever had. They're all the \"crispy outside\" part!

I've only ever had Freddy's once before about a year ago at what I just discovered was their flagship location. So tonight's meal feels like kind of a rediscovery. I had the cheesesteak which was not my favorite but probably prepared exactly as it should have been.

At the condiment/beverage counter was lacking a bit of attention as the sweet tea was empty as was their famous fries sauce. They'll get a pass on that this time."}
{"text":"Sometimes, a girl has a hankering for a mean, juicy burger and Freddy definitely provides. Previously a Fazoli's (rip), this location has actually been thriving for awhile now, but it was only recently I was made aware just how good a fast food burger joint can really be. 

My bf and I decided to stop in for dinner, both ordering the #1 Original Double -- it was love at first BITE! Juicy and savory, and I liked how the edges of the patty are a little crispy. This cheeseburger is now on my top 3 with In-N-Out's and Shake Shack's. So good!

I'm not really a fries type to begin with, but their shoestring style comes out hot and shiny (shiny? yes, grease!) Don't forget to sprinkle some of that Freddy's Famous Seasoning on top, located to the right corner of the pickup counter. In terms of dip, the Famous Fry sauce didn't really impress me (mayo/ketchup/pickle juice concoction), but the Jalapeño version of it was okay. Its pale orange color can trick you into thinking it's Cane's bawse sauce, but don't be fooled.

We also tried the Chocolate Brownie Delight Sundae, which you can sub for your drink for $2 more. It's so incredibly rich that between the two of us, we barely put a dent in it. If you mine deep enough though, you will discover a brownie at the bottom. Personally, it was too much. Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate."}
{"text":"I find that I am not the biggest fan of steak burgers, but Freddy's by far has the
Best frozen custard in the area. Surprisingly, I find the hawaii inspired concrete amazing!!!! (Surprised because Im not a fan of pineapple with any sort of dairy product... even though I like pineapple! Go figure.) A definite must try in my book!"}
{"text":"The place was ok. Wasn't too sure about the burgers since it seemed like it was really thin and over fried. The taste is unique so I guess it is a good thing if you are into that. I prefer thicker patties.

A little pricey... not as good as In N Out in my opinion. And for the price, also not as good as Steak N Shake (which comes with fries with your order) for the same price."}
{"text":"The chili's really good. Not fond of how thin the meat is on the burgers. The concretes are wonderful."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. This place is tasty and has great customer service. My family loves burgers and this place gives us something a little different than the traditional burger. Great prices as well."}
{"text":"I use to go to the Freddy's at 51st Ave and Bell Rd, but when I moved to Surprise it became too much of a drive. I was ecstatic when they built a Freddy's at Litchfield Rd and Waddel in Surprise. 

Everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong ordering. The fries sauce is as awesome a the fries themselves, which are thin cut the way I like them.

The burgers are good and the meat is fresh. The frozen custard with lots of topping options is probably the best thing Freddy's has to offer. 

The dining area is always spotless and the staff is friendly. The food gets made quick and comes out hot. This is not just another burger joint it's something at a whole new level.

I would highly recommend this place and watch for many more check-ins from me."}
{"text":"Great service and very clean. But the burgers are average and I didn't care for the skinny fries - you don't taste the potato. I may come back to try the custard."}
{"text":"If nothing else, come here for the dessert! The frozen custard is amazing! 

I personally love getting a double steak burger with cheese fries on the side. I love that the patty isn't a traditional thick one, but thin and delicious. 

Also, they have great low carb options as each sandwich can be converted into a lettuce wrapped one. 

Definitely a higher end fast food chain."}
{"text":"Once again, one of the best burger places in town. It's review is focused on the new fish sandwich and fish and chips. Fish sandwiches are all the rave right now infant food restaurants. McDonalds started with the fish sandwich many years ago and others have followed suit. Without commenting on any other fish sandwiches, Freddy's fish sandwich is among the top of the list. Crispy, hot and full of flavor, this sandwich is two pieces of fish in a fried batter, served on a toasted white bun with a slice of cheese and a \"Freddy's\" sauce (tasted like 1000 island). 
On this day, I chose the sandwich and the fish and chips. I hope these two items become part of the regular menu. Both are worth the money and a great addition to the already amazing menu.
If I were to give one piece of criticism, it would be the pricing for the hot dogs. The dogs are pretty spendy. Although they a delicious, there is just no value for the hot dogs.
If you're going to eat at a fast food restaurant, skip the chain places and go to Freddy's. Simple food done well, good pricing, and some of the friendliest employees in Las Vegas. Keep up the good work Freddy's."}
{"text":"Tremendous excellent service.. And bomb food i highly recommend this place to eat, from the chicken sandwhich to the burger all great food... And ice cream .. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors to the Freddy's on Litchfield near Palm Valley and decided to go to the newer one on Waddell. This place is a franchise owned and was a bit different than the Corporate owned. The first thing they do not offer Senior Discounts, the food was very greasy and the tables all needed to be cleaned. As per usual burger joints there was no adult in view and the music was too loud even for an old deaf factory worker. I will keep going to the old Freddy's in Palm Valley, much nicer."}
{"text":"Shoestring fries, fresh custard shakes, and fry sauce. Freddy's is a \"Fargo's Favorite!\""}
{"text":"Soda machine is down. Girl at the counter waited until we finished ordering our entire meal to let us know, all of our meals coming with drinks. No carbonation, no ice unless you go to the counter and ask for it. Talk about frustrating, probably would have gone elsewhere had we known before we ordered everything. Very underhanded."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is apparently known for their burgers and custard, but I haven't tried either! The first visit I only ordered fries because I'm not into burgers and wasn't too hungry. I also hit up the drive-thru on my first visit so I still wasn't sure what Freddy' s was all about and since hubby was in the mood for a burger I suggested we go back and try this place again. Since Freddy' s promotes Chicago dogs outside their building and the fact that they use vienna all beef hot dogs, I figured they were based out of Chicago. Nope! Freddy' s started in Wichita, KS. The burgers are fresh, never frozen and grilled to order. Custard is churned fresh daily at each location. I will try the custard on the next visit!

This visit though, I ordered a \"Chili Cheese Dog\" priced at $3.89 and \"Chili Cheese Fries\" priced at $3.59. The hot dog, all beef, was topped with chili, cheese and onions. I enjoyed it! The chili cheese fries were much bigger then I expected. The fries are shoestring and covered in chili, cheese and onions. I liked that nacho cheese sauce was used and I love shoestring fries, but the fries were soggy from not being hearty enough to hold all of the toppings. I'm a fan of onions rings so I ordered some priced at $2.29 and found them to be pretty good. The onion rings weren't as thick as I would like, but they were big round-wise and cooked just right. Hubby ordered a double \"Hatch Green Chili Burger\" priced at $5.49 and he enjoyed it. 

The inside was clean and the employees friendly."}
{"text":"I know it's been a while since my last review, but I finally managed to snag some time to write for you guys! I went here with some friends and I was surprised it was so close to me lol.

If you guys are anything like me, you probably thought this was more of a dessert place because of the word custard in their name, but I can assure you that they also sell yummy American food like hamburgers and hot dogs!

I ordered the number 7 combo on the menu which came with a burger (2 thin patties, bacon, 2 slices of cheese, tomato, lettuce, and onions), fries, and a drink. The burger was alright overall, but the best part was the taste of the patties. The buns were kind of flat and flavorless and the raw onion taste wasn't very appealing to me. Also, the bacon slices were all clustered in one area so it was hard to get an even ratio of bacon with each burger bite. Honestly, I think In and Out still has the best burgers, but this place was a nice change of pace. I do have to say that their fries are skinny, crispy, and just delicious. Soggy fries are never a good thing and I'm glad I didn't have this experience here. They also have a fry sauce which you guys have to try, but I think it is just basically thousand island sauce lol. 

I also got the PBC and C sundae which was basically vanilla ice cream topped with pieces of reese's peanut butter cups, banana slices, whipped cream, and a cherry. One thing to note, you can get your dessert in two forms: concrete or sundae. Concrete basically means they will blend in the toppings with the ice cream which makes it easier to eat in terms of cleanliness. It does make the dessert look kind of sad though because it just looks like they used a bunch of ice cream and not as much toppings. The sundae form is messier, but you get to see and TASTE the toppings which I enjoyed when eating the reese's peanut butter cups. 

Overall, I'd say this place was decent and is nice to try out if you have never been here. If you really want delicious, cheap burgers, In and Out is still the place to go."}
{"text":"Drove by this place a few times and finally decided to try it. Glad we did, my wife and I both loved it. The ice cream/custard is to die for...very creamy! We also had some hot food, I got a hot dog and the wife got a patty melt, both were fresh and delish"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for the first time to eat vanilla custard & I absolutely loved it & everything about this placs
First of all I called to ask what is custard & the 2 different guys I spoke with were so so nice & friendly, I told them I'm pregnant & I was craving something sweet they said come on by we'll hold your own side of the restaurant for you they made me laugh
When we got there the staff was so warm & friendly I can't wait to go back & try everything else on the menu"}
{"text":"So I am shocked I have never had Freddy's Steakburgers.  I ended up ordering the traditional steak burger with cheese of course. Had the fríes with cheese a Pepsi to wash it all down.  The burger was actually really good with a soft bun and the burger itself was cooked perfect and very good. You get skinny fries which are good and the cheese on top since I ordered cheese fries made them great.  I also order the traditional Turtle Sunday.  It was super delicious with nice just the right amount of hot fudge and caramel with nice big walnuts. Will defiantly return when I want a good burger fast and easy. They have a drive thru."}
{"text":"If you like Steak Burgers... this is your place.

To anybody who is used to the typical hamburger, you might not be a fan of a steakburger... just sayin'.

Their custard is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"It was all fine and good we got there, and got our food. Than my mom wanted an ice cream and she CANNOT HAVE CHOCOLATE. She ordered vanilla with bananas. They gave her chocolate with chocolate chips. My step dad went to go and change it because IT WAS not our fault. They got annoyed sat there and went back and forth. Instead of just apologizing and fixing their mistake. Definitely will not be coming back did not deserve any of the rudeness. Don't know what her name is but she's a red head there seems no matter how many times you tell her something she can't get it right. Horrible service I will definitely be letting all my 87,000 followers on Instagram know to NOT come here."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  People that work here are very pleasant.  It's clean and great service !  Custard is to die for!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled Freddy's has opened a location in Vegas!  The burgers are flavorful and delicious.  The custard creations are heavenly.  The service is quick and wonderfully friendly.  This is the only place I've been to that has those wide straws that help you be able to actually drink their thick malts.  The only reason I left off the 5th star is that the prices really are too high for what you get.  That doesn't keep me away, though.

I wish you had pretzels to mix into your concretes!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Great place to bring the kids for lunch. Love the chili cheese dog and shoestring fries"}
{"text":"Considering I don't like fast food places or fast food in general for a variety of reasons, I have to say that I really like Freddy's. Maybe it's partly because that was my brother's name. Probably it's partly because I love Frozen Custard and can't get it in San Diego. Mostly it's because I always enjoy the food I get here, unlike most fast food restaurants. The hamburger is has really good flavor, the shoestring french fries are exactly the way I like them, the employees are usually cheerful, the decor is cute, the place looks clean,  they are kid-friendly if I want to bring my grandchildren here, I can get a kid's meal if I'm not real hungry, and the Frozen Custard is delicious. 

At this particular location I nearly slipped and fell because of a spilled drink on the floor but that was not the employees fault because they didn't even know it was there until I pointed it out to them. As soon as I did a nice young man mopped it up.  He didn't seem terribly concerned that I had almost fallen or that someone else might fall,  but at least he took care of the problem. I will return."}
{"text":"Ok place for lunch.  Prices are ok, the food is average.  Place is pretty clean and friendly.  There is a good food selection, food is greasy."}
{"text":"This is a new location.  Everything is clean and well kept. The food is Freddy's :)

I find the service to be excellent - always friendly and taking the extra step whether with special requests or bringing food to the table."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while, trying to find the trailer to vote.  We were going to just stop in and check out the menu.  OMG, the smell just captures your attention.  Before we even got in we decided we were going to eat!   It was really good!  The fries are thin, and the burgers are good!  They also sell shakes, and custard Ice cream or what ever custard is.   We will be back thats for sure, it was awsome, and the price isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Nice fast food place. I ordered the veggie burger and asked for it to be vegan so no cheese and no fry sauce (it has egg in it). After we placed the order, the manager came up to me and said that the buns are made with egg and offered to make it a lettuce wrap instead, which I really appreciate, definitely a sign of good management. 

Food was great! Good quality for fast food. I also had the fried pickles (which according to their allergy info online are free of egg and dairy) and the fries and both were delicious!

I do hope they get more vegan options in the future but all in all I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all I am a Angelino through and through. I was born and raised less than 3 minutes from the original IN-N-OUT. I've been eating and loving IN-N-OUT while still in utero. I've had many burgers some great some not so great.  IN-N-OUT is always the standard to which I hold all other burgers.
 Until today.... Today I ate at Freddy's for the first time and I felt both amazed and sad.  
First let's start with the fries fresh crispy perfectly seasoned strips of golden deliciousness. I almost have no words. They are perfect. 
Next the burgers is fresh nicely crispey edges. I am Amazed at the flavor and the freshness. Everything about this burger was AMAZING!! 
The party melt with green chilies was fantastic as well. I can't believe that after 37 years IN-N-OUT has been dethroned. Freddy's is hands down the best burger place I've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"Average at best. Steakburgers were overcooked and under-seasoned. The steakburgers at the other, more famous place are much better. On a positive note, the fries were tasty and the place is managed well."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I have wrote to corporate and they wrote me back offering a free meal, I wrote back but never got anything much less a response back. I emailed them again and still no response. When apologizing they should follow back up and not ignore there customers."}
{"text":"The Sarasota, FL. location has been open less than a week.  You would expect them to be on their best behavior, trying to lure in new customers.  We bought 2 Chicago dogs and a Chicago dog combo that was supposed to come with fries.  When we got home, we found that it did not, even though we paid for them.  The dogs were cold, the rolls were wet, and the meal was totally inedible.  They have two flavors of frozen custard-vanilla and chocolate.  Wow.  Culver's is just down the road a couple of lights.  The food is better, the frozen custard is better, and there is a flavor of the day.  First and last meal at Freddy's."}
{"text":"Solid place. I always get the hotdog hamburger combo. The buns are nicely toasted. The fries are a little annoying due to the fact that they are small. Custard is also good. Haven't had anything bad here. The fry sauce is decent as well."}
{"text":"For a first time run I was extremely satisfied. 
The young lady who took my order did take the time to ensure that I would be happy with my purchase by explaining various things before I ordered. 
The sweet tea was fresh, as was their ice water. 
I enjoyed a hot dog and fries with a few of my favorite toppings. 
If you LVE fries theirs are not quite shoestring but they are tasty none the less.  
They even have folks who come and bus your table for you. 
Nice nostalgic trip back to the days when service and your name were nearly synonymous."}
{"text":"What's this \"In N Out vs. Shake Shack\" nonsense? May I suggest throwing Freddy's into the mix too? This Kansas City institution deserves as much props IMHO...Why? Lemme break it down for you one time...ready?

 Burgers? In N Out, Shake Shack, and Freddy's are all good if you're comparing the double double, shack double and California. I like 'em all...equally flavorful, equally bomb! Freddy's just has that old school flavor which reminds me of the burgers at Shoop's(who remembers Shoop's???)that used to be tucked away in the Antique Mall of America waaay back in the day...Oh, Freddy's and Shake Shack got hot dogs and other varieties of burgers...In N Out dogs? No such thing...


Fries? Freddy's shoestring fries with their jalapeno fry sauce are just as bomb as Shake Shack's crinkle cuts dipped in vanilla malt custard shake(don't knock it till you try it) or
 extra extra well fries from In N Out...

Service? Freddy's has service on par with the other two...great service when placing your order, constantly checking on guests, and even bussing peoples tables...all 3 places have equally great service...

Desserts? In N Out has milkshakes...Shake Shack and Freddy's got concretes, sundaes, and other dessert creations on top of milkshakes...Freddy's Turtle Sundae or any of their signature sundaes or DIY desserts is a perfect ending to your meal , a bit cheaper and more generous than SS...Hmmm...at INO, you could go for a neapolitan shake...if you didn't already get it with your Double-Double, 3×3, or what have you...that's why this third party candidate should have every right to be compared to the other two....

Even better yet, I say let's just squash all this beef (see what I did there???) and be content in the fact that we have the best of three worlds?...how many cities can honestly say they have In N Out, Shake Shack, AND Freddys??? That's what I thought...;) ALOHA!!!

{"text":"This place was PACKED when we got here...Wifey placed our orders, I went ahead and snagged a table just as a party was on their way out. Perfect timing!

They have alot to choose from here-Wifey chose a cheeseburger combo with a chili-cheese fries upgrade and I went with a patty melt combo. Both were very tasty and well seasoned, but  the patties could be a little thicker. 

I love their skinny mini fries. they were all perfectly cooked and a generous portion too.
Give the Chili-Cheese Fries extra love by hitting them with some Cholula action...The staff and service is great here, and another cool thing is you can order dessert with your meal and put it on hold. When you're ready for dessert, go up and hand a cashier your receipt, or one of the staff will be nice enough to get it for you after bussing your table.

We shared the Turtle and PBC & B(Peanut Butter Cup and Banana) Sundaes. They were good, and the consistency of the custard was smooth and creamy. Overall, a good first visit and we'll definitely be back...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim and I was not disappointed.  Had the single burger and fries and they were fresh and yummy. Definitely will be trying them again."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Fast Food Hamburger is Steak & Shake - none in Arizona.

Freddie's is close! With that wonderful crust like coating on the Burger, which I have had in several iterations. My favorite \"Test\" of a fast food burger is how it holds up with only two simple additions - pickles and mustard. Only two until now can withstand this test and still deliver taste - Steak and Shake and Fuddruckers. Now Freddie's has become my favorite Arizona Fast Food Hamburger.

Want to go for the gusto? Try the Triple. More taste than one can handle!

Oh, the French Fries are absolutely terrific, if you like the really skinny kind, which I do.

Have tried the Chicago Hot Dog - nothing special.

The Custard? It is indeed richer and creamier than regular Ice Cream, but I seldom have room for it. 

Taste, Taste, Taste! WONDERFUL!

Nice friendly employees as well and every time (several by now) I have been, a Manager comes to ask if everything is to our satisfaction, in a very clean and nice environment."}
{"text":"We were in the area and my boyfriends mom wanted to try their frozen custard. It's much creamier than ice cream. I got one of their specialty custards, however you could also make your own with the toppings that they have."}
{"text":"Wow! Had to yelp this Freddy's location while it's fresh because of the AMAZING service I just received from kaycee and kimberlan (sorry if I spelled names wrong)! So in general I love Freddy's food and this location never disappoints based on the high standards and level of expectation that I have come to associate with all Freddys. That said I was delighted to find out that Freddys also accept Apple Pay... Especially when most of the time I am forced to go into another option because most places in the East Valley and Phoenix metropolitan area do not except Apple Pay... A huge inconvenience to all Apple Pay lovers. That said we all know sometimes Apple Pay doesn't work the way it supposed to... this was one of those times. Instead of sending me away hungry to an ATM or competitor, these ladies took care of my bill. I hope that The GM of this location and proud Freddys franchise owners everywhere take some time to give kudos to these two ladies who absolutely made my day and made me a Freddys customer for life! To all the haters giving less than five stars to this location please cease-and-desist... You're either too picky or just miserable people... I wholeheartedly recommend this Freddys location matches for their excellent food butfor their exemplary above average service!"}
{"text":"Great beefy burgers. They do have steakish flavor. Had the triple steak burger with cheese. They paddies are thin and almost have a crust. But definitely beefy flavor. 

Fries are the shoestring variety, not my favorite style but they are crispy and don't taste bad. 

The frozen Custer is best in class. The best frozen dessert in any fast food. 

Decor is traditional diner red and white. A bit cliche, but it is well done and the seating is very comfortable. 

Service is great. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 

Will become part of the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Loved it. The cashier was so helpful, this being our first time and all. The burgers were amazing and loved the amount of fries you get with the order. Even the kid's meal was a decent portion. It was yummy."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty little bit on the pricey side and took forever to get our food don't like the slow wait"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here. The last was about 8 or so years ago when I went with a friend for a burger. And I think I remember it was OK. Last night we were looking for a quick, light desert. Not sure how light frozen custard would be considered but with strawberrys on top it worked. We sat outside and watched the lightning as it seemed every city except Glendale was getting pounded with thunderstorms."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and I was very anxious to try this since I had heard it was better than Culvers...I thought it was okay...I got a Triple Burger and still thought it was too small...the frys were okay...personally too thin for me.  I don't know..maybe I was comparing it too much too Culvers....Culvers was better because it filled me up...had more flavor and it was more greasy.  So, in conclusion...I liked Culver's more but Freddy's is healthier."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru. They screwed up our order, food tastes like shit and it was some how $21 for two burgers and a kids meal."}
{"text":"Love the steakburgers, homemade/fresh French fries. A great place for a tasty fast food burger meal."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Yes this is a fast food joint, but you would never know it, every single one of the employees is extremely polite and helpful.  I even heard a few thank yous! I love excellent customer service!

I took my oldest daughter out for a mom daughter night out on the town, and she picked Freddy's for dinner, now I have never been here but was up for trying something new and pretty proud of her for picking some place she hasn't been before, she is the pickiest eater out of all my kids. So I went willingly and with a smile.

From the menu you can tell they have a lot of frozen custard desserts to choose from, I not liking ice cream/froze custard did with out but my daughter did try the Hawaiian delight, which did look appealing. She loved it.


For the burger I went with the double steakburger California style, its 2 patties, Freddy's sauce, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes side of fries and a drink.   Never had a steakburger before so I was unsure what I was getting into, the texture is different than a regural burger, and more on fried side then I like , the bun was fresh and held it  together. This burger was a messy but good burger. Maybe could have been hit with more sauce.   Well the fries, I didn't care for them, but its because I am not a fan of shoestring fries.  What are those? How can they even be called fries?  Personally my favorite fries are the steak fries, I like knowing I am eating a potato damnit! Shoestring is just a waste of time for me haha. But if your into them, then you will love them, they were perfectly cooked, not too fried not to soft.  

Over all, I liked it, I don't think I would get the fries again, but I wouldn't mind trying another burger."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and frozen custard selections! Service is fast. The staff provided good customer service and a clean environment. We were greeted and asked how our meal was. This was our first visit to this place. But will be regulars, and more familiar with the menu and ordering process."}
{"text":"I am not sure why the hype for Freddy's.  2.5 start at the best.  The burgers are ok (meat is so thin, you can  almost see through it), fries are good, frozen custard is ok.  Maybe I like my burgers a little meatier?"}
{"text":"First visit here! Customer 299 today! Excellent service and a very friendly crew!! Way to impress!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of  Culvers. Burgers, fries,  custard, etc. Can't speak much on the menu because I only ordered a turtle sundae. It was tasty. Made just like the one I get from Culvers. Service was fast, the place was clean, reasonably priced and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here yesterday for an after lunch treat and we were very pleased. Upon coming in we were greeted by the cashier, Mark, who asked if it was our first time and when we replied yes went through the whole menu.  At first we were a little disappointed about the custard options only being vanilla and chocolate but he informed us how they were able to mix up syrups and fruits for different flavor options.  We finally settled on a regular sundae and a concrete one. When we received our sundaes one of our order was incorrect, the young lady apologized and very quickly was able to make up a new one. The sizes were perfect and flavors were great. Great place for some ice cream your way. I'm definitely going to have to go back and get some of their homemade ice cream sandwiches and try their meals too!"}
{"text":"I didn't know that the \"double patties\" were actually double patties. I thought there was a mistake and was given kids meals by mistake...  and paid 8 bucks for each kids meal.. oops I meant double..."}
{"text":"This place is 2 miles from me and I've never been.  We finally went and tried it and it was so dang good.  And I'm from Utah where you grow up on fry sauce and no one here has it.  Who knew only 2 miles away i could get it.  Hubby had patty melt and it was really good and i has the California cheeseburger  and it was super good.  Grandson had a hot dog so we had to try that and it was good too!  Everything was super."}
{"text":"Have driven out to Henderson to enjoy Freddy's and have anxiously awaited one on our end of town. Looked here on Yelp and saw it finally opened today. The staff here are so friendly and helpful. I ordered my burger Wrap Style and kept adding items to my order. (Try the deep fried dill pickles) The Worker redid my order to make it a combo and save me $$. The food is great and the service is friendly. It's worth the short wait for made to order eating. Be sure to dust your fries with the seasoning....delish!
Stop by, you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"First visit was a huge surprise! I went on the Sunday after the new location opened and ordered 3 meals and 3 sundaes. Yes, there was a long wait but I expected that being that they were newly opened. What I didn't expect was to get to the window and the cashier to say, \"Sorry about the wait, your meal is on us.\" Made me day! The food was pretty good! We loved the burgers, and the hotdogs were very good. The sundaes were delicious:)"}
{"text":"Drove by here everyday for a month while they were building this location never ate here before had to try it the burgers don't dissapoint in the flavor dept I'm a burger lover but the size is lacking so if u like a meaty burger dont get your hopes up a single steakburger is the equivalent to a McDonald's cheeseburger but the flavor is on point just wish I could say the same about the fries if your gonna go skinny fries offer regular fries as an alternative all in all I will be hitting this spot again to try the hot dogs and concretes"}
{"text":"Cool new place. It's a lot like Steak and Shake except without the shakes. It's like Steak and Custard. (badum bum) We ordered the traditional California burger, the chili cheese fries, and a turttle custard concrete. 

The California burger is what you would expect a traditional California steakburger to be (it tastes just like the steak and shake california burger). It's got the thinnly sliced steak burger with the all the California burger fixings.

Now, I do love their chili cheese fries! I'm not a big fan of chili cheese fries only because it's so filling and I get full off it so fast. It's got the steak burger chunks in it with nacho cheese and mini cubes of onion on it. The french fries are also those thinly cut fries which makes it all the more better. You taste more of the chili cheese than the thickness of the fries which I loved.

Now, the turtle custard concrete. DELISH! The custard was nice and thick and super solid! It was rich and creamy. It had all the fixing of a turtle any thing. So the pecans, caramel, and chocolate just made that custard taste so good. If you prefer it premixed and you want to just sip on it, get the concrete. If you dig the helpings on top where you can eat the best of the best first, get the sundae."}
{"text":"Every time my family and I come here, it is amazing! The burgers, the fries, the frozen custard, even the hot dogs, they toast the bun even! Everything is so flavorful, juicy and super delicious! Oh and the Freddy sauce!!! Yummy! This place is worth every calorie!!!!"}
{"text":"I find myself eating here a lot more than the other burger places, and I go here first...so I must like it more than the rest."}
{"text":"I have only tried their steakburgers, and for a chain they are quite nice. They are fresh nicely sized not too big not too small and usually cooked well. I consider them a close follow up to In-N-Out on the fast food chain scale and much better the Tommy's."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second try when I went back to Las Vegas in December 2014.  I must say that I'm impressed.  

I had to order the double patty melt again because that is my favorite.  It was absolutely delicious.  

The service this time was A++++++ it totally made up for m y first visit.  I will definitely be back again I still need to try the frozen custards."}
{"text":"Listen, this has to be one of the most flavorful burgers I've ever had! I've tried the number 1&5 with extra grilled onions and they were equally as delicious  I wasn't particularly crazy about the fries, not because they were nasty but because I dislike shoestring fries. I also had a turtle Sunday and holy smokes it was the best!"}
{"text":"The chocolate custard gets 5 stars. It's what keeps me coming back. And how awesome is that little \"mini\" size so I don't get crazy and eat a HUGE Chocolate Malt (which I can, but don't want to!). Lots of malt, rich chocolate flavor--YUM-ME!!!

As for their burgers, just okay for me. They're the flattened out, cube-steak style, which is Meh but I do love the big pickle and onion slices. 3 stars.

Shoestring fries are also not my thing so I'll pass on those next time and try the onion rings. Maybe a Patty Melt is in my near future...'cause I know I'm going back for that chocolate custard!"}
{"text":"The patty melt and a chocolate malt. My favorite \"cheat day\" (or \"cheap day\") indulgence."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Have had Freddy's before. Line for drive through was wrapped around the parking lot so we decided to go in. Layout in side was awkward to stand in line as my ass was at someone's table while waiting in line. Cashier couldn't hear my order and had to scream. Then asked me to use a expo Marker to sign my receipt. Soda fountain area was a mess. Lid was off the ice tea and just exposed. All the trashes were full. Waited 20 mins for our food. Which was ok but definitely rushed and missing quality. 

I hope the owners read this and actually care about quality and customer service and make the appropriate actions."}
{"text":"The party melt was delicious! I loved the skinny shoestring fries. The chocolate malt was killer! It was so rich and chocolatey!! We will definitely be back again as soon as we are in that area. I wish they'd open one up on the North side of town near Craig road, we would eat here all the time if it were close!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best custards I've ever had. One of the best parts of being an adult is eating custard for breakfast! I definitely recommend them for your late night snack or morning custard like me :) 

The food was pretty good too, but I'd stick with what they're good at and that's cold delicious deserts."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm apparently not a fan of the meat.  They are too thin and dry yet amazingly greasy looking and tasting.  Now, the taste was not bad, just the overall product was not a good as we thought it would be as the burgers are cooked to order.  The fried curds were ok and the shoe string fries were ok.  It seems like they are targeting Culver's but they are not quite there.  The atmosphere is cool and while we didn't try it the shakes looked good.
We definitely want to go back to try the custard so we'll give it another go at some point."}
{"text":"I was in the area (my old neighborhood) and I had a hankering for subs.  But Freddy's doesn't serve subs, you say.  You would be correct.  I drove to my favorite sub place and it turned out that the power entire shopping center where the sub place was located was out.  So much for feeding that sub craving. 
 I consulted my trusty yelp ap for another option.  This is where Freddy's enters the picture.  I got the California style burger, which basically means it has their special sauce on it.  They grill their burgers really flat at the edges which makes the edges sort of crispy and charred.  It actually added flavor, but I can see how some people wouldn't be a fan of that. 
 It wouldn't be a meal if it didn't end with dessert, so I ordered a mini vanilla custard with cookie dough on top.  The vanilla custard was so creamy and delicious and you could tell that the cookie dough was top quality (and trust me, I know my quality cookie dough!)  I would absolutely go back, especially for a sweet treat fix!"}
{"text":"My first time to Freddy's. Drive-thru experience was excellent. The cheese burger was very good. The fries and dip given to me was the best I've had yet. Compared to other similar burger joints, Freddy's is it! They also seemed to have a diverse menu. Lots to try!"}
{"text":"We ate here during opening weekend. The place was packed with wall to wall people.
We ordered, steakburgers, chicken on a lettuce wrap( an option for those who don't want bread ) and fries. We got to taste free samples of the custard.
Consensus of steakburgers, very good but not exceptional, Chicken in a wilted lettuce leaf nothing special. Standard shoe string fries., onion rings, cheese fries etc. all good
Frozen custard was yummy.
Menu features a variety of steakburger sandwiches, , hot dogs,  chicken tenders, chili, a veggie burger, kids menu, malts, shakes, variety of dessert toppings.
For those who enjoy such fast food, probably a great place but not for me."}
{"text":"6/11/2018  I was in a hurry and wanted a quick burger and fries so I stopped in at this location.  The  place was clean and had the 50's look and the place had several customers.  My order was taken by a friendly person and my order came out in a couple of minutes.  They announce your order by \"guest #\".  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and large fries and a drink.  The burger was better than I expected and it actually had the old burger flavor that I was used to eating in the Mid-West.  The girl that took my order eventually came around to my table and asked if everything was okay and if I needed anything, which was a nice touch.  I would recommend giving Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers a try."}
{"text":"Just arrived at the nearby hotel and were soooo hungry..... airline food is a no-go for me.     

Saw Freddy's and thought perfect quick and hopefully good.   Not disappointed at all THEY WERE GREAT, 
Couple of burgers fries onion rings and they were tasty in deed 

Kind of reminded me of Culver's only better.    A great place for a quick meal!   Thanks"}
{"text":"Shame on you Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers! I went in yesterday for lunch with my brother. We both wanted to try the \"Original Double Patty Melt\". So you would think that when they say a burger or a patty melt is a \"double\", it's going to look like what you would find at In & Out Burger or Tommy's or Wendy's, etc, etc. You expect to see 2 burger patty's! So I get my order and look at it. I look at my brother and ask if what I had ordered was in fact a \"Double Patty Melt\". He assured me I had. I looked at my receipt and that's what I paid for. But I see a paper-thin poor excuse of a beef patty (Oh my god! You could see through the fucking thing!) laying inside 2 slices of bread smothered in grilled onions. Confused, I went to the counter and advised the cashier that they had given me the wrong order. She puts on rubber gloves and proceeds to \"finger my patty melt\" in order to show me that there are 2 beef patty's under in between the 2 slices of bread. Get this, they cut the sandwich right down the middle so that you have a patty on each half. But they make sure that the ends that are cut have the patty's over-lapping each other by maybe an inch. So as long as those ends overlap, they can call it a \"Double Patty Melt\". I'm thinking out loud \"Well that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. The sandwich isn't big enough to justify cutting it down the middle.\" So, it's not really a \"Double\". It's just two incredibly small and paper-thin beef patty's set side-by-side on even smaller slices of bread. Never again Freddy's! Very misleading. Oh and by the way... NEVER EVER PUT RUBBER GLOVES ON AND DISMANTLE YOUR PATRONS FOOD IN FRONT OF THEM AND EXPECT THEM TO EAT IT AFTERWARD! DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying Freddy's. We had great service but were disappointed in our food. We got the basic steak burger and perhaps we just don't like steak burgers but it was too tough. We then ordered custard. It was soooo good!!!! We shared a concrete but have decided to never share again. We each want our own!

After talking to many friends and neighbors, we have found that most people agree about this. Steak burgers aren't that great but custard and milkshakes are fantastic."}
{"text":"Godawful food.

I had been meaning to try this place out since it opened. I finally got around to it today, and it was just inedible trash. We ordered a steak burger and a chicken sandwich, neither of them are even edible past the first bite.

Save your money, you can get dumpster food for free."}
{"text":"I just want to say Freddy's is the bomb-diggity! Awesomely good Steakburgers. They are like no other!  They give you a ton of yummy crispy fry's. I haven't even been able to get to the treats. Great friendly service from Ryan this last time!  The service is consistently superb!"}
{"text":"The burger carton at Freddy's proclaims, \"To us, every order is a special order\". Maybe that explains the missing top bun on my burger. This wasn't a great first impression of their food after waiting about five minutes at the drive through window. Luckily, I planned on eating in the car and noticed before I got home. I headed back inside and approached the presumed manager (wearing a polo shirt), and he was friendly and apologetic.

Once he bunned me, I went back to the car and tried my double steakburger, California style. California style comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, raw sliced onions, and the typical thousand island-style special sauce. The burger is smashed and crispy, Steak 'n Shake style. It was tasty, but I felt it was a little small for the $4.69 price.

Despite the bad first impression, I will probably give Freddy's another try. The chili cheese fries are calling me..."}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly here. You can feel the \"Happy Days\" spirit right when you walk in. This is the first place I've been to in a long time where the business was overstaffed for the amount of customers there. I guess its a good thing for customers, but it looks too busy behind the counter. 
Anyway, I'm giving this place a 3 out of 5 because I went in to try their frozen custard. Their vanilla custard tastes like McDonald's ice cream. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE McDonald's ice cream, but I think I still prefer Mr. D's frozen custard. However, I do like that Freddy's has mini size options, so I may opt for this on my not-so-frotard-craving days. I must go back to try their steakburgers now!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! I'm a new fan of Freddy's! The Chicago Dog I had was amazing and the bread was oh so soft and fluffy. I also love their fries - super skinny and no oil residue. My wife had the Chili Cheese Dog and it was spectacular as well. Afterward, we shared a chocolate malt and it was awesome!

Sure, we shared our fries and the malt. Even so, we only spent $11 on lunch - now that's a deal!

I can't wait to go back and try a few more of their desserts and other entrees!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a good home made burger and custard shake. Very reminiscent of the 1950s small diner scene not like all the other regurgitated fast food conglomerates we have. I absolutely loved the food."}
{"text":"Man was the staff stingy on napkins, ranch and ketchup in the drive through! Great food with amazing dusted fries with seasoning. However, I felt the staff wasn't courteous enough to give a paying customer that wanted some freaking ketchup and ranch with their food and a napkin to wipe my face and hands! Oh get a mini desert instead of a regular if you can help it, quite a bit of food for me."}
{"text":"Fast and sooo good. Skinny fries good also. What's not to like about a steakburger! I had #1 original double steakburger OMG. My wife and I both said it was better than In & Out any day!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food. The tables were filthy, napkins were low, Dr. Pepper was out. While 4 people talked behind the counter, the dining area was filthy. We had trouble finding somewhere clean to sit."}
{"text":"What can I say other than concretes put a smile on my husband face that I can't.

The burgers are yummy, the hot dogs too.  The only thing I would change is the thickness of the fries.  They need more girth."}
{"text":"Yes, Freddy's is a fast food joint, but having said that is is probably my favorite. I grew up having frozen custard and so I consider myself a frozen custard expert! My dad used to own a frozen custard business and he is extremely picky and he is the one who first brought me here. On top of the fact that they have great desserts, their food is awesome too. I love that they have shoestring fries, and their burgers are really great too. Their menu is just different than other fast food joints. For example, they have a combo that includes a hot dog and a hamburger. If you are in the area you have to stop by and try Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream cake!! I shopped around and they have best prices, bonus is cake is so big!! Chocolate is the best, we didnt have a bday in the family but got another one because it was so good, customer service is amazing, venue is very clean and inviting, i went to new decatur and charleston location."}
{"text":"I think I like fries again! Shoestring fries, what a marvelous thing :)

The burgers are buttery tasting & the meat is REALLY thin. I like it, but if you are a ravenous carnivore, you'll need to order at least a few doubles ;)

I would recommend dinning in. The cool red & white diner is enjoyable for young & old. Also, you get bigger portions of fries and better condiment selections. 
Yes, I do believe you get punished a bit when it comes to the drive-thru. I got 1 ketchup packet (1!!!!) per order of fries.... When I ate there I had wonderful variety of fry condiments & as much as I wanted!"}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly. The food is delicious. I recommend their bacon burger. Also, don't forget to have their cheese curds. They are really good when you dip them in their sauce. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Good hot food, it's greasy but it's an old style diner so if you aren't looking for greasy food then this isn't your place haha! The service is always friendly, the wait time is mediocre but I won't complain since you wait for your food to be made fresh, definitely worth a short wait! Their fries are thin and crispy. The shakes and ice creams are AMAZING."}
{"text":"I'm NOT impress!!!! Very disappointing.  We had Patty melt,  the patty was thin crispy not juicy at all over cooked.  Onions inside the burger has onions skin not pleasant.  

No flavor. So not worth it. Waste of time and money. Over price too. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Meh...I wanted this place to be something special, especially because of it's odd placement in the middle of my favorite neighborhood shopping center. Everything was just okay. Pretty pricey for a basic combo with an average burger.

I get what they're trying to do as far as market comparison goes, but my allegiance still lies with In-N-Out for sure. Hell, Steak-N-Shake even.

May go back to try the custard on a hot day when I'm bored, but certainly no rush. Then again, I'd probably just get distracted by Krispy Kreme across the way & go there."}
{"text":"As far as a fast Burger and shake goes, this place is tops. The fries are thin and crispy but not overdone and their frozen custard is a dream. You'll know why the shake straws are half an inch thick right away, they work perfectly for the thickness of their custard shakes.

The prices aren't too high either, for the quality you get over your average fast-food place a buck or two goes a long way here.

If only they had more locations, I honestly just keep forgetting this place is around because every time I go I am immediately glad I did. 

Their hot dogs are pretty \"meh\" but it is a burger place afterall, so you should be having one of those."}
{"text":"Finally a Freddy's right near my house! Love their steakburgers & grilled hotdogs. Fries are great too. The best best best frozen custard in the east valley IMO. So delicious! Very friendly staff at all locations and good service. If you've never had a steakburger, try Freddy's first. If you've never tried Freddy's steakburger, what are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"So not only that they not give me my drink for my combo in the drive through they denied my dessert and the manager told me that she was sorry but I will not get my order I will go back to in and out after this not sure what this people are thinking"}
{"text":"The burgers are sloppy, the meat has almost no flavor, and whomever thought shoestring fries were a good idea needs to be slapped. I don't think that there was a single enjoyable thing to my visit here and I don't see myself ever returning. Even McDonalds seasons their meat....."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at a Freddy's. I was expecting to be waited on but you order at the counter just like in n out. The staff was friendly and the food was tasty. Not too expensive either. I had a double steak burger and chili cheese fries which were very tasty."}
{"text":"Finally I found real custard in Vegas! So good and they have concretes like I used to have back  home. All the way across town u but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and though I don't typically review fast food joints this one definitely deserves some kudos. The employees are ALWAYS nice and fast/efficient. I typically go here during lunch time when it is fairly busy and have never waited more than a few minutes for my food..pretty impressive considering this isn't like MCD's where everything is already made and sitting under a warmer. 

Even though it isn't on the menu any longer you can get a burger dog - delicious!

cheers!"}
{"text":"Perks: good food, good price, fast service!

This place has one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had from a fast food joint, or in general. My boyfriend and I had placed an order for a veggie burger and a hatch Chile steakburger meal. The food was out within 3-4 minutes of us ordering! Amazing! The fries were like matchsticks and so delicious. Like I said, the veggie burger was so tasty and filling. My boyfriend loved his pepper burger and the fry sauce that they have. We were both pretty stuffed, and by that I mean STUFFED, but we really wanted to try their frozen custard. We decided to share a mini pbc&c which is a peanut butter cup and banana (with cherry) concrete... A weird name for a really thick shake. :)

It was so amazing but I really wanted to barf by the end of it. Completely my fault for having no self control, but I blame them for having such good food.

The only thing that makes me sad about this place is how far it is from me. The completely opposite side of town but it is totally worth it. 

For my veggie burger and my boyfriend's meal together, the total only came to $12. Add that mini concrete and it came to $16. So worth it for the gorging and wanting to barf (aka me not being able to control myself with their delicious food right in front of me). We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Freddy's always has the best food! You will enjoy the food here if you like thin burgers. Their fries are crisp and thin. Each time we've come here, the service has been great. The food has always been hot and the restaurant is always clean. The staff is friendly as well. Their custard is the best. It's like Steak n Shake but better and so much better than Culver's!! Give it a try."}
{"text":"For a new twist--- try their burger. Smashed down meat, crispy edges, great bread. I was completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"A nice change from the traditional fast food burger.  Fry's are too thin for my liking but my wife loves them.  Next time I will try the frozen cusrard.  It looks great."}
{"text":"I only have a few things to say:
1. The fries are probably the most amazing tasting fries I've had in the state of Arizona.
2. The custard/sundaes are the bomb.

That's it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Loved the double steak burger with fries.  Fast and fresh.  Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I ordered a bacon and cheese steak burger and it came out delicious. I substituted their fries for onion rings and it's yummy although it's more towards the salty side. I ordered the dirt and worm custard which had vanilla custard with bits of Oreos and gummy worms. The environment is super cute. I feel like I was in the 60s at a diner. Will come here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Food is always hot and fresh!! Staff is always welcoming and nice!! Great selection with food and frozen custard!!"}
{"text":"I am posting this today, but can not remember what day I went. I know it was last month, but the place stays fresh in my mind.

The food was great, the service was friendly, but they forgot to make my food! I waited about twenty minutes, but eh, not  a big deal. I was out of town for work, as I often find myself. I was in no hurry to rush back to Motel (#). Before you start to make assumptions, they really did forget to make my food. There were no orders up, and no food on the grill. I'm not sure why is happened, but when I inquired about my food it was an endless stream of apologies.

The manager gave me a business card good for a free meal. I came back the next day and ate another good meal, which was only better than the first one because it was free!

I like how the manager goes table to table asking how the meal is going. This is something you normally see at places that are more formal or fancy like Olive Garden.

The place was so clean, it was hard to believe. I wish that there was a Freddy's near my home."}
{"text":"Ok frozen custard Sarah s it all. This place is great!! I think I have tried just about every sundae they have. Only a few I haven't but let me say they are all goooood. I also am a huge milk shake fan an they are very good here as well..There hamburgers an fries are great. The fries are so crispy an yummy. Hamburgers come with mustard pickles an onions but you can pick a choose what you want. I love the thin smashes patties as well. I love their onion rings as well. The  customer service is off the hook. Always fast and friendly. This place is always clean, an even if there busy their busting the butts to make sure tables are clean an ready. So I highly recommend trying Freddy's if your in the mood for some great shakes an burgers..."}
{"text":"This went to visit family and saw a Freddy's brand new. it seems they need time to get orders right. However, when they deliver your food it is surely delicious! The quality and flavor is great. The military discount is a nice gesture as well. People taking orders are friendly overall great place."}
{"text":"After very careful and considerate scientific study, it has been determined that Freddy's frozen custard is well, fantastic!

Yes, we think of reasons to visit the West Side just to have custard, and have been there quite a few times since first discovering it back in late November.  One scoop of vanilla and one of chocolate (side by side, please) - $2.50 - that is all it takes to make me happy. 

So what is better than just the custard?  When you have it with french fries!  That is a whole different level of artery-hardening goodness.

On our most recent visit, we mentioned to the man behind the counter (who turned out to be a manager of multiple locations) that we intend to eventually try a Steakburger, but since we always show up after a sizable lunch or dinner it just hasn't happened yet.  As we were enjoying our custard and looking at the photos that line the walls of the restaurant, he came up and handed us a Steakburger with cheese (neatly cut in half) to try!  He said he didn't want us to wait another day to try a burger.  Yes, we were stuffed with sushi and custard and yes we ate it anyway.  It was tasty - thank you!  :)

Established in 2002 by the sons of WWII veteran Freddy Simon and headquartered in Kansas, Freddy's currently only has three locations in AZ (with two more coming soon).  Anyone want to go in on the $25k franchise fee?  Then we can have custard anytime!  :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Freddy's many times and Just ate there again last night. 

I love the bacon steak burger, yum yum, and the fries are awesome and portion size also is great. 

Very professional staff, clean dining area, and what a way to end your meal with some awesome ice cream!  Mega Calories, but its Worth It!

Totally recommend this place for the family and friends, not really a date kinda of place to take your boyfriend or girlfriend,  unless your a cheap skate :) Funny Ha Ha

Great place to go after a sporting event.

Good Job Staff!"}
{"text":"Recently ate here for the first time and all I could say is YUMMY!  I went to the Warmsprings location and the staff was super friendly. I ordered the Single Steakburger combo and was not disappointed! The patty is thinner than your typical burger but it was packed with flavor and I loved the skinny fries! Make sure to try it with the spicy fry sauce!!  My sister ordered the Patty Melt and that was awesome as well! I finished my meal with a Signature Turtle Sundae which was AMAZING! In&Out watch out, your prices may be slightly lower but Freddy's is just as flavorful, if not more, has more menu options like hot dogs, chicken tenders, kids meals (w/full cup of apple sauce) and lets not forget the sundaes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Well the ice cream desserts are tops, but while the burgers TASTE fab, they are so thin that even a double doesn't cut it!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to eat healthier, but then I think about Freddy's! Easily the tastiest burgers I have ever had and the service is great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a long drive out of my way but well worth it! The customer service is out of this world dynamite! The restaurant is very clean and the atmosphere is just great! I have nothing but positive things to say! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Freddy's as I heard about it on yelp and decided to give it a try. I ordered the small Brownie shake and a regular fry which equaled about $7.00. I thought it was a bit pricey seeing as the shake was $5/6 dollars and smaller than 16oz.. The fries were good and crispy. They were similar to in-n-out fries and really felt fresh. They were practically steaming. The shake was great, I couldn't finish it cause it was so heavy but it was nice little treat.

Overall, im coming back to try some chili and cheese next time..."}
{"text":"OMG to DIE for! I highly recommend the original burger with fry sauce. Sooooo yummy! Prices are a bit steep, 11 dollars for 2 burgers but worth it to me. It's a treat though!!! Better than any other burger joint!"}
{"text":"Not that great. Good, not great. Looked awesome- and the malt was so rich it was almost inedible!"}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers and fries. I had the original triple cheeseburger and fries and was well pleased.
 I also had the Chicago dog, cheese curds, and a dish of vanilla custard and was not impressed. The dog was lacking in toppings and just average, the curds were very firm and salty, and the custard was a glorified soft serve.
I definitely would return for the burgers and fries, as well as the clean  atmosphere and quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go.  Their Steakburgers are really great with a good flavor and fast service.  Their fry sauce tasted a little different at first but then became accustomed to the taste.  Fries are shoestring fries with a really great flavor.

We tried their custard as well and it was delicious.  Overall a great place to go and convenient location."}
{"text":"I think I am a fan of this place. The steakburgers are amazing and the staff is great too. I always order the double when I come in and it never disappoints. One day I went off the beaten path and decided to get the patty melt. Bad move because it wasn't good at all. That's the only reason I am giving this place 4 out of 5 stars. Not sure if it was a bad day or not but the patty melt was meh. And to add insult to injury the Diet Pepsi tasted like medicine. I hate Pepsi anything but I could tell this was not just simple hate, it was just simply bad.

I will be back here soon because I love the burgers but when I do come back I have to try the chicken. I actually try not to eat a lot of red meat but the steakbrugers here are just awesome. They keep the place pretty clean too and there hasn't been a long wait all times I've come here. Oh and I must try the frozen custard soon too, right? This is one of my favorite burger joints."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had.  Better than sit down restuarants.  Much better than In and Out (whos got everyone brainwashed for some reason).  Fries were great hotdog is great even the veggie burger which I had a bite of was pretty good.  The custard there will put to shame any ice cream you can get unless you churn it yourself.  A+++"}
{"text":"I got to give this place 4 stars because they are always on top of it.. My brother works here and does a great job. They have a decent variety of sandwiches. They also have good service too."}
{"text":"Just as great as all the other establishments! Have been needed to do a review on this place since I have been here so much. The French fries with their special fries sauce is too addicting. My brother had recommended me trying the lettuce wrap instead of the bun. I usually do that at in n out and I was excited to try it here. I had their new jalapeño pepper jack Steak burger in a lettuce wrap, and let me tell you, it was money. The lettuce was wrapped tight enough so nothing would fall from the side and just tasted amazing. The steak burger patties just melt in you mouth! My brother had a burger wrap as well with cheese fries, which were delicious. Place is easy to find and the workers are quick and pleasant. Plenty of parking outside! Side note, if you military they have a discount! Thank you Freddy's, I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is freakin' awesome!!  I tried the Freddy's Original Double burger and it was absolutely incredible.  It didn't taste like it had been frozen and microwaved. The two patties both had cheese on them, which helped to enhance the already wonderful flavor.  The lightly seasoned fries were really good too. I can't wait to return to this place."}
{"text":"Wow. After the disaster across the way at Freeds Bakery I wanted something to eat to soak up the liquor and ventured into town for this gem! The only thing that would make this place 5 stars is Diet Coke! Why does everyone in LV have Pepsi products ?? Gross!! Anyway the double patty melt was so good on super toasty rye bread and the shoe string fries were perfect ! I wish they had this chain in OC !"}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  It was really good.  Reminds me of Steak and Shake in Chicago.  Food was fresh and tasty - staff was very nice!  Please build another store in Fountain Hills, AZ!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place! I finally got to go and it was so yummy! I definitely recommend it if you're in the area. Also the service was awesome! The employees made sure my trip was well worth it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"After trying lots of burgers in Las Vegas it's clear that  Freddy's stands out above the rest in the QSR category. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love In-N-Out, which has great burgers and fries that I've devoured with regularity for over thirty years. And I enjoy the outstanding burgers at Smashburger as much as In-N-Out, equally as good but very different. 

When it comes to Freddy's Original Double burger, it arrives seasoned and cooked to perfection every time, so juicy and flavorful with a crisp ring of meat candy around the outer edge. There is nothing like it in the burger world. The fries are mediocre but forgotten with each bite of the burger! 

Here is my ultimate testament. I only allow myself one visit per week to any single restaurant, especially burger joints. I do this to keep from getting tired of my favorites and also to avoid packing on unwanted poundage. You can usually find me at Freddy's on Monday because I just can't wait any longer."}
{"text":"Hmm... a Culver's / Portillo's hybrid that is more pricey and less good....  The plus side is they serve Vienna hotdogs here, that's an all beef best hot dog on the market.

The fish sandwich was ok. The Cheese fries are nothing special at all, in fact we didn't even want to finish them.

The bacon double cheese burger was a typical burger.

The onion rings were decent.

Their Nutter Butter cookie thing is not that great, way too hard and not enough flavor to it."}
{"text":"FREDDY'S STEAKBURGERS
The best Double Patty Melt I ever had! Thin slices of steak piled high between 3 pieces of rye bread, topped with grilled red onions & swiss. Portions of the meat hang over the edge of the bread & were grilled to well done. Yum!  (I asked not to make my sandwich greasy)  Be hungry or else split the $8 meal, which also comes with a drink. 5"}
{"text":"So much better then In & Out. The burgers are probably my favorite as far as fast food is considered. I really love the fry sauce as well. My kids love the custard but Neilson's is still my favorite for that but they have a close second. Next time you want a quick good burger go here"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for ice and went old school with chocolate sundaes and cherries on top. The ice cream here is so smooth and indulgent. We opted to eat in and glad we did the restaurant was very lively atmosphere. We needed to be around people . Freddy's friendly staff and customers and welcoming place hit the spot.

I ordered the Freddy's number one which was Freddy's original and it was fantastic. The price of the combo is around 8.00 but it is well worth it in the quality of the beef and cheese. The bread they use is just the right soft and for American food Freddy's is an original."}
{"text":"I was at the Galleria & I was absolutely starving!!! I didn't want mall food so I relied on my good old faithful Yelp to assist me. I ordered the double steakburger w/bacon & an order of fries. The cashier was friendly & got my order correct.. It took only a short amount of time & my food was ready. My Burger was good. It was very fresh & hot off the grill. It was prepared correctly also. The fries weren't good to me. I don't like thin shoestring fries. They were hard & not as fresh. The burgers are definitely worth the trip here. The fries are not!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are a little small, yes I know. But they're amazingly flavorful and really satisfying. Good service and of course, amazing frozen custard. I never try to eat too much there so I can save room for the delectable dessert!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and custard. Place is clean and the staff is super on top of things. I'd say at least four or five employees checked in with us to see if we were okay or needed anything. I'd say this could be annoying, but it was clear that this is a standard. Anytime an employee went in the floor, they greeted each customer. Was impressed that within seconds of a table leaving, an employee was on that table cleaning it and preparing it for a new customer. Friendly faces and clear that the employees enjoy their job! Thanks for making our lunch a great experience."}
{"text":"Okay...I have been here once. But I was in town visiting and heard from a few peeps that this spot was worth checking out. When we finally found it, we strolled in. Digging the old school atmosphere! Placed our order and we waited, giddy like schoolgirls. I had a patty melt, my lady friend had the PM with 'shrooms on it, and her mom had a burger. Everything looked AWESOME when it arrived. The meat is great, totally different from anything you get from any fast food joint. (Yuck). The little shoestring fries were GREAT! I usually prefer bigger fries, hell, even sometimes curly or smothered in chili, but these little guys were great. Matter of fact, I was here a little over 2 weeks ago and still haven't had fries from anywhere else. No thanks. All in our group loved their food. Next time I am in town, we are going back. Also, the worms n dirt was great as well. That frozen custard is a must-try."}
{"text":"MMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is SO good, and everyone is REALLY nice!"}
{"text":"Cedric and Gina were so friendly we were driving by saw the sign it looked so good.  We are here now and everything was amazing. Grey burger"}
{"text":"Must have come on an off night because these burgers are seriously off the chain!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers and this place is awesome! I don't know why it has taken me so long to try it. Every time I'm in the area I see the long line at the drive-thru here so when that many people line up, you know it must be good. 

This is my new go-to pre-movie quick dinner before hitting the Colonnade for a film. Freddy's is FAST. I mean, order and you'll get your fresh and hot order in 5 minutes or less. I don't know how they do it. I also don't know how they can have such low prices. Seriously! My husband and I had a soda, cheese fries, double bacon burger and a triple cheeseburger and our total, with tax, was around $16.00. Now you can't beat that for a meal of this quality!

If you are watching your carbohydrate intake or are an Atkins / low-carb eater, Freddy's is wonderfully accommodating! They will wrap your burger in lettuce or just give you the meat with a fork and knife. They don't act weird and employees actually understand that you want a lettuce wrap. 

The burgers are very small and thin but they are super flavorful with a nice little \"crust\" around the edge. I would compare them to a cross between Smashburger and In-N-Out. There are lots of free toppings you can add to your meal as well as reasonably priced premium add-ons like chili and bacon. If you are extra hungry, I'd recommend the triple patty burger. That's what I normally order and it's a good size and will take the wrinkles out of your belly (I don't eat fries or bread so I NEED that extra meet and cheese)! 

The chili here is kind of gross. I wouldn't recommend it. And if you order the cheese fries, beware that it's not real cheese. They are covered in squirt day-glo fake cheese (like Cheez-Whiz). Yuck. The cheese slices on the burgers are nice and melty however. Don't miss the fry sauce (much loved in Utah) available at the counter. I like to slather it on my cheeseburger (it's basically thousand island dressing). 

The menu is simple and straightforward -- burgers, fries, frozen custard and hot dogs. Be sure to ask about any special promotions so you won't miss out on a tasty bbq bacon burger with onion rings! 

I've never had the frozen custard here but the desserts and sundaes look super delicious. If you have a kid under 12, buy them a Freddy's t-shirt for $5 and each time they wear it to the restaurant and buy a kid's meal, they'll get free frozen custard. Luckily they don't have a promotion like this for adults or I'd weigh about 400 pounds.

The soda fountain has Pepsi products and Diet Dr. Pepper! The interior dining room has a red and white vintage vibe and is spotlessly clean. Ample seating and friendly employees. I love this place and I am fast on my way to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Weak burgers, melted \"frozen\" custard, and heavily salted fries.  The food her is carnival level cuisine without all the sophistication.  Pass by this place, the grease and salt alone will knock off a week of your life."}
{"text":"A hard working crew, serving quality burgers and hot dogs fast. The Chicago dogs were hot and loaded with goodies. We are looking forward to try the steak burgers."}
{"text":"Wow. How have I not gone to this place sooner?!?! My favorite fast food place in the midwest was/is Steak N Shake and this tastes pretty darn similar. The burgers are thin, but cooked to a crispy perfection & the fries are thin and awesome as well. On my first trip, I had the patty melt, which was awesome. On my second trip, I had a burger and it was amazing. And on my third trip, I went for the hot dog and it was outstanding :) Have yet to be disappointed by the food at Freddy's. 

Next, we have the customer service here, which is top notch. There are a bunch of young kids behind the counter, but they all seem to have an impeccable work ethic and great manners. I don't know how the managers go about their hiring process, but they're doing a great job. 

Lastly, frozen custard... just do it. You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Freddys hands down has some of the best shakes/concreates/custard is LV and NV for that matter.  That mind you, is comming from someone born and raised in Wisconsin which is know for their shakes/malts and custard, thinlk Leon's and Copp's in Milwaukee. I usually like to try the vanilla shake because vanilla is kind of a litmus test.  If the vanilla they serve is good all the other flavors will inevidebelty be good. I got a mino choc shake which was as good as anything you will find in wisconsin. Also tried the oreo concrete which isn't quite as good as dairyqueens blizzard, but still very good. 

  So now on to the food lol, I had the chilli cheese fries and a single steakburger w/ onoins ketchup and mmustard.  The burgers are very good the best part of it is the nice thin pattie which is crispy and kind of burnt on the edges which I really like. Reminds me of 5 guys patties. The bun isn't exaclty my fave, I prefer true german thin hard rolls.  But regardless the bun is stil fresh and good.  The chilli cheese fries are great, more or less shoestring(really really thing) fries with a cheese sauce which is pretty good and not artificial tasting at all likke a lot of cheesse fries from other places tend to be. All the other toppings seemed to be of good quality and tasted good.  Overall, I have found a new fave joint to go to 3 or 4 times a month.  I really like it that much.  Of and also they really have increible service and get your food out crazy quick."}
{"text":"This is one of our quick weekend spots when we're craving junk food. The shoestring fries are perfectly crisp and they have a great veggie burger for non-meat eaters. We've never tried the custard so I can't attest to that aspect of the restaurant, but their special sauce and seasoning salt keeps us coming back. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I'D GIVE IT 20 STARS.....

Freddy's was recommended to me by a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about how bad nearly all burger joints are.

Thanks friend, you've saved me.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. 

Thin steak burgers with a crispy edge.... assembled with care (unlike the Wendy's stuff that looks like a big girl just sat on it). Pickles were fresh and plentiful, placed with care across the entire burger. I stress \"with care.\" They do apparently and it makes all the difference in the world.

The shoe-string french fries are the best! Thin, so they get crispy (unlike the crap they serve and Raisin Cains... great chicken and bread but sorry guys, your \"steak fries\" suck). I LOVE FREDDY'S FRIES!

The service was fast and friendly. The young senorita at the drive through had a smile that made me happy to be there and her eyes sparkled like the Nile. Bless that nice young lady. 

These burgers and fries are good enough that they could eventually bring world peace. 

Great job guys! You're my new favorite eat spot for the blessed American burger."}
{"text":"If you're think that California based burger chain is the best, then you've not had a Freddy's burger.  Dear god, this is so delicious, so good.  Have one with hatch chills and your toes curl. Don't let em talk you into a special. Why? Because the classic Freddie's double classic is perfect. Have you ever had a burger so good, it's lacey? That's what smashburger dreams of. It's what in n out has forgotten.  But Freddy's has perfected it. Truly. 

Trust me. And this is just about a burger.  Totally the most underrated burger in Vegas.  In America.  Way better than Shake Shack if you're want validation.  Look. My first shake shack was great. Mind blowing,  my second a let down. Freddie's was perfect the first time, and has never disappointed. And it continues to be crave-worthy.   

Fries are thin, crispy, they're good. Only complaint is you have to eat them in the parking lot because they're cold before you can get them home. 

Onion rings! Frozen custard?  I love those things but the burger and friy combo is so good and so many calories, I can't allow myself to indulge in more.  But you should.  And let me know."}

{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or dessert.

Thier hotdogs are really good, served in split top buns (which are the best IMO). Along w/ their shoestring fries, its a great combo. I still havent tried their burgers, but my husband really likes them. 

Their custard is really good as well. And for those who are wary of trying it because its called \"custard\", relax its just ice cream. Its a little bit thicker and richer than traditional soft serve, but it is go-od. They also have a variety of toppings to choose from, so trust me youll never know the difference."}
{"text":"Went here for deserts.  Very wide variety of frozen custard desserts.  Not really a fan of egg-based products though it was tasty.  Need to try their steak burgers next!"}

We'll definitely be coming back soon!"}

{"text":"Burgers were great. Didn't have time for custard but we did have the fry sauce with our fries. This you have to try. Both fry sauces are great regular or spicy. I ordered the California style without thousand island dressing but added mustard and it was great! Will definitely try it again after it isn't so busy. Last visit it was super busy and didn't want to fight the line for custard after eating. Daughter didn't like the hotdog very much, bun was very hard and cold."}
{"text":"My people, my people, my people. Freddy's is a fraud! It is a knock off of the Midwest darling Steak and Shake and they ARE famous for steakburgers! It burns my buns that they copied Steak and Shake. If you have ever had both you know what I am talking about. It's like listening to your favorite song for years, and then some idiot does a remake and screws it up!

Little info on SNS: Steak n Shake was founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois. Gus Belt, the founder of Steak n Shake, was a quality restaurateur who owned a restaurant/gas station called Shell's Chicken. Central Illinois had plenty of chicken and beer restaurants so Gus soon realized he needed to be unique and different. With a little help from his friends, he started Steak n Shake in February of 1934. 

The Steak stood for STEAKBURGER sandwich. Gus would wait for the busiest time in his counter-only restaurant, wheel in a barrel of steaks (including round steak, sirloin steak, and T-bones) and grind the steaks into burgers right in front of the guests. Hence, the origin of the famous slogan \"In Sight It Must Be Right.\" 

The STEAKBURGER sandwich is still the finest burger served anywhere in the world-the finest of steaks ground into pucks, and through the art of grilling on a very hot grill, turned into a burger beyond comparison. 

Freddy copied the idea from Gus. When Steak and Shake franchised and moved east stretching from Illinois to Pennsylvania down to Florida. That is when Freddy decided to begin moving west from Kansas. At the time Steak and Shake was only as far west as St. Louis, MO. Freddy uses the same signature colors red, black and white. SNS standard steak burger comes with mustard, a slice of onion, and 2 long slices of classic dill pickle. FFC serves it the same except the bun is different and the pickle is a spicy claussen type. SNS serves skinny fries with salt. FFC serves them with seasoned salt. SNS has hand dipped shakes. FFC does custard. 

Now that steak and shake is making it's advancement further west, currently Dallas is the furthest, FFC will be toast! 

I have eaten at FFC, and they do make a decent steakburger. I love steakburgers and this is as close to the original as you will find west of Dallas. However having tasted the original from SNS I cannot be as excited as other yelpers about this phony. In my opinion Freddy ruins the burger with those over powering pickles and the fries are to skinny to support seasoned salt it is over powering. I am not into custard so cannot remark on that. 

I like In and Out better than Freddy's but not better than Steak N Shake. Also you cannot compare a Steakburger to and In and Out Burger. 

For those Steak N Shake fans out there, if you order a steak burger from Freddys, don't get the pickles and ask for regular salt on your fries. 

I can't wait for Steak N Shake to make it to Phoenix, I will be camped out at the front door!"}
{"text":"I've been to Freddy's three times in a week. The burgers are soooo good and the frozen custard is REALLY great! The staff is always friendly and makes ordering very easy. The restaurant is very clean as well. This is definitely our new favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of burgers this place is as good as any high dollar burger joint , but better. I like how it's not too expensive and the place seems like a 50's restaurant. Fries was great and the burger had enough flavor to know its not made with a lot spices. We'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Holy Salt Lick! My wife and I stopped at Freddy's after going to a movie.  We'd been passing Freddy's for a couple of months and thought it might be fun.  Walking in it has a kinda Retro-Jetson's meets Culver's feel.  Lot's of folks having lunch so we thought could be a good sign.  She ordered a burger and fries, I ordered burger, hot dog and fries.  Our order came up and we took it back to our table.  My wife started eating her burger and I noticed she wasn't too happy.  The burger (meat) was very thin and very very salty.  She also picking at the fries.  My hot dog was good, but I noticed the same level of salty flavor on my burger but I do like salt.  The patty was very thin and I could see through the grind.  My fries were tasty and I wondered what was wrong with my wife's.  I asked for some her fries and it was like a triple scoop of salt.  Generally, the flavors were \"meh\" but salt level way too high. Gave up on the fries and left some burger to toss.  We really wanted to like Freddy's but we probably won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"I didn't have a good experience here, although my Daughter suggest we try Freddies, cause she had eaten at the Gilbert location and said it was so good. This one by the Chandler Mall had cold fries, and since I was in a hurry I didn't ask for new one's, We also ordered Chicago Style Hotdogs and a Steak burger, well the Chicago Hotdog wasn't Chicago at all, I'm from Southwest MI just across the Lake from Chicago and know that even the Hotdog they used here wasn't the ones they use and the toppings were not authentic either. My malt didn't taste like it had any malt in it. The malt taste like a very chocolatly frosty from Wendys! Oh! I think the bun on the hotdog was to be toasted and buttery but since they used regular pickle relish it soaked the bread and was soggy. My Husband said the steak burger was way too thin to taste. I don't think I'll be back. I will however go and try out their sundae's maybe. They looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my husband and I were hungry and we aware on our way to Montesano's for pizza when I saw Freddy's in the old, failed Faziolis space at Silverado Ranch. Let me start out by saying that I DO NOT LIKE SNS AT ALL. So I would never compare Freddy's to them. Would you compare a watermelon to a grape?   No. In short we LOVED Freddy's! Service? Fantastic. Speed of service? Lightening. Food? OUT-EFFING-STANDING! I like Five Guys and In-n-Out, actually, I love In-n-Out. But here is what Freddy's does that Five Guys doesn't have or In-n-Out doesn't do...charge extra for a shake instead of a soda. A beverage is a beverage, end of story.  For those who gave Freddy's a less than exuberant review, I implore you to try them again! This doula will be feeding on Freddy's frequently! YUMMO,"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I wasn't impressed at all - the patties in the burgers are flat like at Smashburger which I love but here the patties don't seem to be seasoned and the burger was just - UMM - Boring. The fries are skinny - don't like that and the custard is watery - don't like that either. We had to return the chicken fingers cause it was fried too long so it was to hard to eat. The employees were all attentive and I was given a free meal comp. for the next time .The special sauce for the fries is good but nothing else really does it for me at all. I had a chocolate brownie sundae concrete which surprisingly wasn't very chocolatey at all and the other time I had a vanilla concrete with banana's and marshmallows - I didn't tast any marshmallows and the banana's were minimal.My daughter loves the free WIFI - but all in all I honestly have no desire to come back."}
{"text":"Freddy's was a treat. There custards look delicious and there Texas Toast hotdog buns was something fresh and different. There fries are also made fresh and the hospitality is up-kept . \"A cool spot, you may have seen it headed to work. Stop in one day and try em' out. You may be delighted.\""}
{"text":"Well run restaurant. I didn't know how good a steak burger was until I stopped by here for lunch. A must try! Very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Just had the Freddy's Steak burger and fries and the Hawaiian delight sundae and it was the BOMB. I am soo happy they are here in Las Vegas because the first time i ate this delicious burger was in Roanoke Virginia in 2015 attending my Granddaughter's graduation from College., and i was telling her when she took us there that i wish we had one here in Vegas. This is by far the best Steak Burger i ever had and being retired from truck driving i have had quite few in different Cities. Freddy, you have a customer for life. Love you guys, love , Lawana Hilt P.s The Fry Sauce is way better than Cane's"}
{"text":"Recently this place caught my eye. Tonight my family and I decided to give it a try. Kinda pricey but the food was good. My daughter is picky about the breading on chicken fingers she usually picks through it, but to my surprise she ate the chickens without picking at them. We got the patty melts with bacon and it was good and filling. The fry sauce is awesome. Once the food has settled and there's room to eat more can't wait to try the yummy ice cream we bought home as well. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is like is like Culver's though the burgers are a little better and the fries are much much better! 

If I am going to shorten my life with fried foods, it will be at places like Freddys,"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the frozen custard alone, we did not get any food. Just happened to drive by this place and my eyes grew wide when I saw the word \"CUSTARD\" oh goodness, need to make a U-turn.

We had a scoop of vanilla & chocolate on a cone to share, after the first lick I didn't want to share anymore, mine mine mine lol

So rich, so creamy, it wasn't soft serve either, but like ice cream that you scoop, very interesting. Love this stuff, they have a location in Victorville which is the closest to where we live, but still far, I can see it now, ROADTRIP!"}
{"text":"I just made my first trip to Freddy's and it was awesome! The burger was good, the custard was delicious and the atmosphere was easy going. I'll be going back soon. The only down side was the 80's music, if you like that, you'll be in burger heaven."}
{"text":"Ever eat at a Steak 'n Shake?  That's what Freddy's is: a Steak 'N Shake kind of burger and it's delicious! 

I liked the fries too: very thin, perfectly hot, not too much salt.

Nice people, the manager made it a point to get me my meal hot-off-the-grill, even though I came ahead of the \"call\" and again he met me while he was cleaning tables.  {See my review of \"The Habit\": their manager never greets customers, can't solve problems from behind a door, always hiding in his office.}  Freddy's Manager was OUTFRONT, ALL THE TIME, WORKING HARD!  

Great burger.  Next time I'll get the frozen custard.  I was too full from my triple cheese, CALIFORNIA STYLE-BABY!"}
{"text":"This is, again, a really good burger.  It's quite thin, once cooked, so a double isn't much, a triple is pretty close; 4 would probably be wretched excess.  I will say, this burger \"feel apart\" sooner than it should, but when that happens, bun falls apart, etc, I always wonder if it's the chef, the bun or me.  I usually think it's me.

On this trip, what impressed me the most was the chili.  Damn, that was a REALLY good bowl of chili!

Very nice staff, seemed really interested in doing their best job. 

You know what, recently I visited Steak and Shake in Tempe; these two burgers, to me, are similar.  Not at all like a Zinburger, which is thick, these burgers are quite thin.  But Freddie's, to me, is a better burger.  Just better.

So: Zin, Freddy's, Lucky Boy.  Stop.  Check, please."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. 
We had to try out this location since it is the closest to us. It definitely did not disappoint. It was a bit less chaotic here, compared to the location on Eastern. 

My husband had to get the double cheeseburger, as the patties are too thin for him to get a single. The single is a perfect size for me. We really like the flavor of the burgers here. They have that crispy flat grille flavor. Yes, it is a thing. And it is tasty. 

It is just a bit pricey for what you get, but not too much. The lettuce and tomato are extra, but in my opinion they are not necessary. I really like the onion rings, which are an additional 50 cents when you get a meal. The onion rings are real batter-dipped. Yum!Still have not tried the custard. But I will soon. 

The restaurant was clean, well stocked, and the workers friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Yum! Ok, this burger hit the spot, and well worth the drive. 

Decided to drive to this location because of the many awesome reviews, even though the one in Henderson is much closer.

Walked in, and it was SO BUSY! Of course, we chose to go on a Saturday around 1pm. I could barely hear the cashier, it was so loud. We had already decided on a double cheeseburger for my husband (thanks to all of the previous reviews talking about how thin the patties are), and a single for me. The cheeseburger comes with onion, pickles, and mustard. I just asked for ketchup and mustard on mine. For the double, we got a meal. For $.50 more, we changed the fries to onion rings. 

So glad we did that. The onion rings were some of the best we've had in ages. The burgers were really good. They had that nice flat grilled, juicy taste. Their pickles are sliced lengthwise. Love that! The single was perfect sized for me, as I didn't feel ridiculously full after I finished it. The double was similar to a decently sized regular burger elsewhere. 

I didn't care for their fry sauce, as it was kind of tangy. I like that they had both ketchup and mustard dispensers by the soda machine. This place was very clean, and all of the dispensers were full. Nice staff. 

We were very pleased with this place, and were surprised that we have not really heard more about this place. We are for sure coming back, and we also need to check out their custard. I fell in love with frozen custard while living in the Midwest, and am looking forward to finding a place as good as Kopp's."}
{"text":"I have seen many post from friends and associates that praised this place for the food. I had the double steak burger combo that was hot and fresh made to order with fries and a drink.  The meat is thin, if you don't mind that. Which I love my meat to be on a thinner side, the fries are very thin as well, but they offer a frie sauce for the fries. Then there's the custard that very flavorful and thick. I got a vanilla shake that is made with the custard (TO DIE FOR GOOD).

The place is an ok size while dining in and the staff are very nice and friendly. They even come around and take your trash once you've finished eating.  If you don't have time to dine in, there's a drive thru as well.  The food was overall satisfying and I will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, fries, and service!!!  Burger was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of juiciness.  $7 for a combo meal with double burger."}
{"text":"The service here....is incredible!! Kudos to the staff!! I came here on a Sunday night around 630pm with some friends who swore Freddy's was better than In-n-Out. I had never been to Freddy's and I was skeptical...boy did it give my nostalgic favorite a run for its money!

I had the California Style double stack steakburger with added hatch chiles (seasonal add-on) and a chili cheese dog with added hatch chiles. I was hungry lol. The hatch chile added a delicious heat to already great staples. I quite like the crispiness of the steakburger and the Freddy sauce. The chili cheese dog was great as well and the bun was interesting; it was like a split/folded thick toast instead of the standard bun.

The fries were really good--they were like crispy straws. I paired them with the Freddy's Fry sauce with jalapeno and it was heaven. They have seasoning bottles at the pick-up counter area so you can season to your heart's content. 

On top of having great food, the service was top-notch. The ladies that took our order were so friendly and fun. While I was hovering eagerly and hungrily at the pick-up counter for my food, I was offered samples of their custard since they knew it was my first time at Freddy's. If I hadn't ordered so much already and needed to catch a flight, I would have definitely ordered a custard. As the woman who handed me the custard said, \"[Our custard] is everything ice cream wishes it could be.\" Smooth, creamy and delicious...

Cheers, Freddy's! I have already looked up a location near home. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service great food yummy! Sitting outside enjoying the food and the day . My mom got the Chicago hotdog and she is very happy as well! Good job guys"}
{"text":"Freddy burgers are excellent however the fries are too thin so you have to put a bunch together to make a fry so you mostly get a fried shell and no potato."}
{"text":"First off let me say this! I loved the sundae! It was one of the creamiest and best tasting sundaes I've ever had! Okay now for the rest of the review. Freddy's is actually in Concord. It was roughly a 20 minute drive that I totally didn't mind. There was plenty of parking even though I went during the evening. The waitstaff was amazing. They were courteous from beginning to end. Since it was my first time I decided to go for their basic cheeseburger meal. I also opted to get my son a kids meal which was just about as big as a regular meal. The chocolate sundae was a mini size but it was plenty. The total came to around $16 which I would say is decent. This isn't your regular fast food joint. If you are looking for a $5 meal this isn't it. That being said Freddy's is worth a shot and I'm looking forward to their other menu options. Maybe a hot dog?! Lol"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries. Both were seasoned nicely and a decent portion. Husband also got a hot dog because he was bedazzled by the picture of it served on a folded piece of Texas toast. He thought it was also very good. Service was fairly quick (we dined in) and I like ordering at the counter and picking up when your number is called. Yes, the burgers are thin but they taste so good that way with their crispy little edges. They are very similar to Steak 'n Shake but a tad more expensive. 

I would've given them 5 stars had they not messed up my order twice. I asked for my steakburger without pickles and mustard and I paid extra for cheese. I got the exact opposite. Their second attempt was almost correct except they forgot the cheese again. I was so hungry I let it go and chalked it up to them being relatively new. Hopefully they will work the kinks out."}
{"text":"My goodness I had the best cheeseburger I've ever eaten in my life! Onion rings were tasty, the fries are good and the ice cream is amazing! The manager was super nice and cheerful!"}
{"text":"I love Freddy's! We go there a lot. Their burgers are good, hot dogs are good, patty melts are GREAT. But the pièce de résistance are their glorious little french fries. They are super seasoned, matchstick size bits of goodness. YummY!

I've never actually had their custard, but it looks pretty tasty. I've gotten it both to go, and sat inside to eat. The inside of the restaurant is super clean. The employees are very friendly.

If you do drive through, you have to wait for a bit - but that's because they are making your food fresh, it wasn't sitting under a heat lamp for 45 minutes. So...overall, 2 thumbs up. :)"}
{"text":"Steak and Shake with different wrapping paper... everything from the Chicago style hot dogs to the THIN steak burgers themselves screams that this \"Freddy\" guy was sitting at a steak and shake one day and decided that he could do the same exact thing except make his shakes a little different.... even the special secret seasoned salt tastes and smells the same as Steak and Shake's special secret seasoned salt does... if you don't want to wait in an hour long line at the South Point you can come to Freddy's and have the same burger experience... 

The burger I got was so  thin I felt like I needed to order another one... and the shoestring fries were a pain to dip with... I don't think i'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with the family after some shopping. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and attentive the entire staff was. Everyone was young and extremely friendly. Very welcoming! 

The restaurant was clean and we got our food right away. Everything was correct and delicious! I highly recommend the number one as well as the spicy chicken sandwich. You won't be sorry with whatever you get because everything is pretty tasty. 

Stop by and see what I'm talking about. We'll be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"The burgers are crazy good . The fry sauce is delicious too. The mint Oreo concrete almost didn't make it home! Love it here."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fries and Freddy's sauce is the Best!!!! Thanks for the great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Well, this place is great. Just opened close to my place and I was pretty pumped. Had it before when I lived in TX. I wouldn't recomend eating here every day, as it's not exactly healthy food, but comparing it to other fast food places? Yeah, this is a great place! Awesome burgers, crispy fries, and the sundaes are very good. Quick, not too expensive, and good flavor. Did I mention the sundaes?"}
{"text":"These are my second favorite burgers in the neighborhood. Their chicken strips and hot dogs are good too. They serve Pepsi products, so they have Mountain Dew here. The fries aren't so great, though. I recommend adding cheese to the fries for sure. I can't eat the fries without the cheese sauce. The onion rings are good though and you can sub if you want. They sometimes have a Hatch chili burger here that my wife really likes. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Freddy's started out really good yet after just a few weeks the store is dirty and the food is poorly made. Employees where loud and food looked sloppy and was not made as ordered. It's sad this place could be great but it's failing due to the help."}
{"text":"Old fashion steak and shake variety now close to my house? I'm in love:)
om trying the custard next time!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers to have. They have skinny fries which I love but they do get cold quick so they aren't that good when you get them to go. Their fry sauce is one of my favorite sauces ever I put it on everything from my fries to my burger. I would definitely recommend coming here for a tasty burger. And try dipping it in the fry sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week and will definitely be back! Their patties are made special, the ends have a crunchy texture that leaves you wanting more. Their shoestring fries are delicious, we tried the chili cheese fries and added grilled onions, it was a huge portion so make sure you come hungry! Their manager with a goatee made the experience amazing for us, to bringing out our food and then giving us a sample of their vanilla and chocolate frozen custard. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went here and ordered 6 chili dogs 3 no onions some fries and fry sauce . Checked the order and all dogs had onions. Told then they fixed the order, so I thought. When I checked the second order the top dog had no onions I assumed the rest didn't either. Once I got home my husband opened the other two
dogs and they had onions also.  So my husband had to eat something else since we were not going back and he is allergic to onions. My 3 year old daughter and I had the fry sauce and her and I got food poisoning from it.  We will never try this place agian."}
{"text":"Ugh, shoestring fries.  Why?  Why?  Why? What's the point?  They don't taste like potatoes.  They're impossible to dip in ketchup.  I hate it.

I got a patty melt to go with my fries that tasted nothing like potato.  The bread was very buttery which is awesome.  The onions were thoroughly grilled.  Cheese was nice and melted.  The patty was unimpressive though.  Beef was super thin and then smashed even thinner for good measure.  Similar to how you can't taste the potato in shoestring fries, you can't taste the meat in the super thin smashed over cooked patty.

Ice Cream looked good, but I didn't have a chance to try.

Restaurant was clean and staff was friendly.

It's a bit more expensive, but Five Guys is still the king of trendy burger joints.  They have real french fries and juicy patties.  Also, Red Robin is quite excellent (AYCE steak fries!) if you are okay with being non-trendy and can deal with the annoying kids running around."}
{"text":"I've been here a hand full of times and couldn't be happier with the service I'm given! The staff are friendly and often give suggestions if you're not sure what to get. The fries are amazing, not soggy or over cooked. My favorite is the California style burger and of course the ice cream selections are to die for!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fast food Burger I've ever had even my family loves it the chili cheese fries is the bomb"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Parking was easy. They have plenty of tables and some booths to sit at. Delicious cheeseburgers and their fries are amazing (shoe string fries) what I call them. I absolutely HATE thick cut fries. So this is definitely a winner for me! Their custards are soo freaking good! I say Go for it! plus it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Yum! Good burgers and the spicy fries sauce is excellent. The Hawaiian concrete is sooooo addicting and hard to stay away from. The hubs loves the chocolate shakes."}
{"text":"Seriously, people? Maybe if your only comparisons are McDonald's and Burger King, you might think Freddy's is in a league of its own. But if you've actually eaten at some of the far superior fast food chains like In-N-Out or The Habit Burger Grill, you'll probably be disappointed with what they offer here.

My girlfriend and I have eaten at Freddy's several times over the years. Each time, our opinion drops considerably.

First of all, if you're going to get a steakburger, ordering a single patty just isn't logical. You must order a double. The reason, is because they smash their patties so flat that the meat is void of any juice or flavor. It's just an ultra-thin slice of what I'm assuming was actual meat at one point.  

The French fries, with the addition of their sauce, are admittedly not too bad. However, they are very thin, which is very similar to what you'll get at the similar Steak 'n Shake chain that is more commonly found in the Midwest.  

Their frozen custard is a complete disgrace. I've ordered turtle sundaes on two occasions. Both times, the custard was so runny and milky that I would have been better off drinking it with a straw. If you've ever been to Culver's, you'll know that frozen custard is supposed to be creamy and dare I say, not much different than traditional ice cream.

Prices are too high for what they're giving you. Strangely enough, they seem to have quite a few fans, as the place was jam packed with the post-church crowd on a Sunday afternoon to the point where I was somewhat disturbed. Clearly they see something that I don't.

Trust me. If you want a fast food level burger, there are far, far better options available in this city. That is, if you're willing to venture outside of the bubble that is Bell Road.  

Not recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic hamburger, fries and ice cream. Clean. Staff had good attitudes.
We will definitely be back.
I took a picture of the double meat with fries which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed taking my kids here for a quick bite to eat.  Service is always reliable and most who work here seem friendly.  The burgers are above average and the fries are great.  You cannot go wrong with the custard afterwards...it's just amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a Patty Melt and fries. I was told by the cashier i may want to order double meat cause the patties are small and people complain. Really? I order just a single patty and she was right. Super small patty. Wierd. You go into other burger places and they don't encourage you to get a double because the single is too small. I found the patty melt to be mediocre. Fries were ok. Shoestring. $6.91. I could have been more fulfilled at in-n-out burger. Everyone was super nice, but the burger. Meh."}
{"text":"Buen servicio amigable definitivamente lo recomiendo la comida estuvo deliciosa y fresca y muy limpia nos atendieron bien"}
{"text":"I drove through and ordered a chocolate custard cone, and wound up with a MASSIVE two dollops of custard on a standard cone.

I was pleased with the price paid for the amount that they gave me (enough for two people, maybe three!), but found the custard extraordinarily rich, and not in the most enjoyable way. It was a little too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! First time at a Freddys. Nice,friendly staff. 6 minute wait for our food. Burgers remind me of Smashburger but thinner and less expensive. I like the season salt type seasoning on the thin fries and the thousand island-like fry dipping sauce. Burger size was fine for me but I would think many may want to consider two patties. Son said chicken tenders were \"ok\". They serve Vienna hot dogs. Best burger in the area."}
{"text":"I love their chocolate shake, fries and California single. .lots of juicy veggies and sauce.. I go there once every month or two"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! Spend $5 on a kids tee and they get free custard until they are 12."}
{"text":"I love Freddy's! Their burgers, fries (and fry sauce) and hot dogs are so tasty. The service is great. Everyone who works there seems happy. Good food and good service....perfect!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and Friendly customer service! I'm pretty excited that there is finally a good burger place in Indian Land. The quality of their food is very good. And they have a drive thru!  I'm a Cali girl so I really like their fry sauce; Reminds me of in-n-out's spread. Im sure I will be here many many times."}
{"text":"I had Freddy's for the first time years ago while I was visiting family in Texas. I was so excited to see they had come to Vegas!! I love this place for a good fast food burger.  I like it better then In & Out. Way better.  They have a better menu, ya know- I can actually take my kids here because they don't ONLY serve burgers. Their custard is yummy! I love the nice thin burgers- and I love the flavor they have. If you are someone who likes more meat- then add a patty.  I actually cannot believe someone said they had a better burger at Jack in the Box- gross! I love that my burger actually tastes like beef. One thing that does suck- they close at 10 on a weekday. How lame!"}
{"text":"Best customer service EVER at a fast food restaurant! Everyone was friendly and the manager was so nice, he walked around and made sure everyone was taken care of. Thank you to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently, it is like a Steak N Shake we had back in Saint Louis. The food was hot and tasty, the customer service was excellent as well. I had a shake and it was pretty good as well. Lots of room for seating and very clean as well. There was a line when we went there but it moved pretty fast and the food came out quick as well."}
{"text":"It was a long weekend so i dont remember exactly what i got, but i believe it was just a regular cheeseburger with fries and a turtle concrete.
I know i liked it all and will be back."}
{"text":"For fast food this spot works fine. It's not Haute cuisine, but it's serviceable and the staff is great. 

Make sure to get a double, and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow okay where do I start. Sooo this is my first time stopping by here after yet another day of gambling at sunset station. Yeah I might have lost, but let me tell you why that went straight out the window when I arrived at Freddy's.

I went drive thru, longer than some fast food places but moved at a good pace none the less. I ordered a double steakburger California style wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, with fries and fry sauce.

I was too excited to try so I ate right in the parking lot. Too many people inside for me, & everyone knows people love to stare you down even if you don't stand out. (Weird)

Okay enough small talk, let's talk about the food.

One word : LEGIT. & this is coming from a serious In n Out fan, like no one can tell me s**t about In N Out, I'll defend that place like I own it. The minute I stuffed my face with Freddy's gooey goodness, it reminded me so much of In N Out, just more topping/seasoning options.

The burger is very flaky, which to me was sooo deliciously good! Fries were plentiful, not too crisp, not too mushy, seasoned perfect. The burger left me wanting more, the double taste more like a single because the meat is thin, but after eating every single bite, not leaving a single piece of meat or fry, I was content. Not feeling overstuffed which is great. WOW is this place addicting...


I beat myself up about not trying this place sooner, but we have found each other now & I don't think we will ever part."}
{"text":"Have you ever ALMOST been somewhere? Like 5 times? Ok, I'll explain. I used to live close to Freddy's other location (Eastern) and would consider trying them but every time opted out for something else. Never really tried their food when they were close by, AND was also told that they were not spectacular. 
Well now, a Freddy's opens by my job and I'm not in a hurry to have them until my co-workers bring in some food and I'm craving ice cream. Oh fine, lets do it! Why not go, get a concrete, a burger, some fries, and a concrete for the Mr. 
OK! Who the XXX told me they weren't all that?!?!?! I can't be friends with someone who tells me lies! As soon as I remember who it was, we're though! 
The bacon double cheeseburger was pretty good! Freddy's offers shoe string type fries, they were delicious when eaten right away but may get hard if you wait. The concretes are freaking good! Star of the show for me. All the mix ins and their freshness will definitely keep me coming back. My honey loved his as well, he's been talking about Freddy's since then. Thankfully this place is by my job and not my house, I'd be on a concrete diet if they were.
Oh, the food here is on the salty side - a plus for me since I like my food more salty."}
{"text":"At first I thought another fast food restaurant... but its not. Its awesome. The burgers are fantastic, and I don't usually eat burgers. The custard is amazing.  The decor inside is adorable.  Yay!"}
{"text":"being from california, didn't think I was going to find a better burger than in n out, but I just did, burger was awesome, fries are shoe string crispy and delicious. really warm and friendly customer service, everyone here was nice and welcoming, smiles all around, especially Janay asked every customer in the restaurant how their meal was and how was everything! my new favorite burger place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yak! That was the worst burger I think I've ever had! I ordered the double. When I opened it, there was so much mustard it was dripping out and the burger. The meat? It was so thin and cooked to the point it was crunchy. Getting nauseous thinking about it. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Good fast food chain. The burgers and fries were goid. The fried pickles were good too, but amount was small for the price."}
{"text":"This is a throwback burger joint; you immediately feel transported to the 50's or 60's (not sure exactly which one; I was not around, but that's how I imagine it!). Service is very friendly, one of the staff came to our table to check on our satisfaction, and another one picked-up the dirty trays afterward! I didn't try their frozen custard, but their double burger is pretty good, available with grilled onions. The fries are skinny and done just right. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Drive thru service is terrible! Speaker is all static. Drive thru times are slow at best. The order was wrong, probably due to the bad speaker system. Inside service is great, thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Freddy's is a typical Midwestern style burger joint.  I'd say the closest comparison is Culver's.  The burgers although very tasty and not overly greasy, are wafer thin.  If you are hungry, make sure you go with at least a double because of this.  The fries are shoestring thing and seasoned well, but perhaps the saltiest I've ever had, EVER!  The thing that bumps this place up from a three star to a four is their frozen custard.  They have tons of varieties, and so far the ones I've tried are amazing!  As for prices.  The burger combos run between $6-$8, and although delicious, small frozen custard treats will cost you about $4.  All and all I like this place a bit more than the others, but just wish they would cut their use of salt on their fires by 50%!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood eatery - Although each time Ive gone Ive only had the Chicken Breast Sandwich and fries, it was all fresh, served hot and deelish. (Ok I'll admit I have stolen a few bites of the boyfriends chili cheese fries, which are insanely good.) The unsweetened passionfruit iced tea is really refreshing!! Was greeted by staffer Aaron S., during our visit, who asked how our food was, which was cool, that \"checking on patrons thing\" only usually happens at larger restaurants, so they really seem to care. Ive seen that a few times now. Great spot! And the custard ice cream rocks!"}
{"text":"Their steak burgers never ever disappoint! The fries are delish! I don't always like shoestring fries but theirs are crispy and very flavorful. The fry sauce is also great! Be sure to try a custard concrete (think thick shake) before leaving. 

The cashier today was super friendly and patient while my girls figured out what they wanted to eat. Then when I told her there was a bee in the window near our booth, she caught it with a cup and napkin and released it outside, what a superhero! I don't know her name but she has an accent and deserves accolades. Thanks for the great service as always Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Love the burgers, fries, and especially the custard!  The Hawaiian is my favorite.  The service is excellent!  Often they will bring the food out to you and are so kind.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"I love the fries and seasoning. Burgers were great! The Chicago dog was tasty, but not a true Chicago dog. The bun is a slice of bread.... lol"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for a fast food burger in Henderson. They make a tasty little burger with equally delicious fries. 

I would have originally given them a four star based on my first visit, but yesterday they were offering Hatch burgers and Hatch hotdogs. This definitely bumps them to a five star in my book. The Hatch burger was mighty delicious and the Hatch chile packed some nice heat. The custard sundaes and concretes are awesome. The turtle sundae was everything I've been looking for in a good sundae-plenty of tasty chocolate and caramel sauces with salty pecans. My husband loved his dirt n' worms concrete.

This little spot is consistently busy. They do their best to prepare food quickly, but don't expect to get in and out as quickly as a McDonald's stop. Good news- the food is much better than McDonald's so it's worth the wait. The only real negative is that this place gets very loud because it is family friendly. It is a fast food burger place so this is probably to be expected."}
{"text":"I was born in the Midwest and grew up on Steak N Shake steak burgers. Pressed thin and cooked on a table top grill, they were unrivaled especially compared to your traditional chains like McD and BK. Freddy's is very reminiscent of those steak burgers and skinny fries. 

The menu is far from overwhelming; they stick to what they're good at. Order a single steak burger and skinny fries. Don't count calories because you will lose count. If there's any room left try a custard concrete mixer (think DQ Blizzard) - turtle is their go-to flavor. 

Staff is friendly enough and drive through is pretty expedient. Prices are on the higher end for what you'd expect from \"fast food\" but it's worth the treat."}
{"text":"So glad they are finally open! We came in and it was already late at night and the cashier Christiana (I even asked her name to add her to this review) made sure our order was correct, brought the order to our table, and came back to check on us to see if our order was okay while also attending other costumers!. She always kept smiling and was always courteous!  She was awesome! Food was fresh and the store was very clean!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend and looked up burgers on Yelp. I was soo happy to discover a Freddy's in Vegas! I first had their burgers when I was in Colorado and I fell in love! I usually don't like burgers but I won't decline Freddy's."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! So pleased that it arrived in the Surprise area! This location has great employees and service and if they ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times I've been there) they are very quick to make sure that you are friendly and properly taken care of! Love me some Freddy's!"}
{"text":"pretty much better than ANY fast food burger. and the prices aren't that bad, I tried culvers once and remember spending close to $20 for two people. you can get a burger fries and drink meal for under $5, but you gotta try the custard."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! Frequent this location and almost always have a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some quick eats at a reasonable price then this is the place to go to. If you want a different alternative that's kind of similar to IN-N-OUT then definitely try this out. And don't forget to get some fry sauce and the custard for your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially  custard ice cream and steak burgers. It's next door to Freed's bakery in the Silverado center.  The interior is red - ceiling lamps, seats, etc. the staff are nice. The self drinks have diet dr pepper and cherry Pepsi which I normally don't see. The steak burgers are thin in patties and cheese w/ onions make it extra tasty. The fries are crips and thin. I highly suggest to try  custard ice cream cone, it's very smooth and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Very professional, kind and passionate staff. The burgers however are just not my taste. Thin, well done and free of any juices."}
{"text":"Shoestring fries!!! Hell YEAH! 

I rate their burgers better than Five Guys  and Smashburger.. but on a different level than In&Out. Single is big enough to look like a double-- the patty is bigger than the bun. I didn't get onions on my burger but didn't realize  that it doesn't come with LT either.. just huge slices of pickle. 

Half a burger is big enough to fill you with a few fries. I love the charred flavor of the meat (although it was a little salty). Bun was pretty good too. The fries though.. the fries and sauce. YUMMMM.

What I've licked of my Turtle concrete so far is delish.. only qualm is that it melted so quick on the 3 min drive from Freddy's to my office.

Service is nice and quick!"}
{"text":"I expected more. The burgers were dry, salty and didn't have anything special about them. Their supposedly \"addictive\" fry sauce is an over hyped 1000 Island dressing, that should be slathered on all their burgers if it's that special. The shoestring fries were good and generous portion. The restaurant itself had a Diner type feel. Looking at the diners will tell you that if you've seen the inside of a gym lately, you shouldn't be eating at Freddy's. Last night was about rebelling a little,  but given the quality and taste of the food,  I could have made a more satisfying choice of places to indulge.
Their service was very friendly, leading me to think they hired a good group and/or Freddy's treats their employees right."}
{"text":"I went to Freddy's 1/26/17 evening. I loved Freddy's grilled chicken until now. This sandwich was flat. I specifically requested no tomatoes nor lettuce. They gave the two without mayo instead. So pretty much a soggy sandwich. The chicken was not seasoned either. 

The only satisfying food were the fries and unsweetened ice tea. Those deserve the star. If those are the only 2 things they care to serve, sell me the meal with the fries and drink price."}
{"text":"Not a total stranger to a good ole steak burger since Vegas finally has its share with the Steak N Shake and Shake Shack but I was super excited to try this place! Looking up reviews prior, it seemed that the hatch green chili burger and the California were the most popular. So I ordered the California as is without onions. California - Tomato, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, double steak patty. The fries were shoe string style and cooked to perfection! A little on the salty side (no need for extra salt seasoning) the steak burger was super flavorful! Melt in your mouth goodness. For dessert we ordered the Concrete (Sundae turned into a shake) vanilla and caramel w/pecans. So delicious!! I'm so happy we don't live in Henderson because I would easily be here once a week. I don't need the extra calories. Haha. Nonetheless we will def be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite new ritual is our Friday night dinners at Freddy's. The staff is always friendly and accomodating. There is one gentleman there who is always just going over the top, constantly working hard. I hate that I can't remember his name to share--but I assure you if you've ever been to this location you've noticed him!"}
{"text":"I've drove past this place a thousand times and finally decided to stop. Did not disappoint!! Burger was hot and juicy! Fries were delicious! Drive thru was very polite and super fast! I'll be back and will bring my family with me!"}
{"text":"has become one of our favorites. always always always good service. never had a disappointing meal. burgers good, generous fries. mango tea is good. gotta have some freddy sauce (like thousand island, good on fries and i am sure it is healthy.) dont forget to try a custard, hawaiian, turtle and brownie are tasty. i prefer the sundae as opposed to the concrete except around thanksgiving they do a pumpkin pie concrete which is very nice."}
{"text":"Great place, the service was super nice. They got a little box to go, really helpful. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have never been disappointed after leaving here. The fries are so so good and crispy. The store is always clean (unless you hit they're rush but what do ya do? ) the customer service is exceptional here, staff is always prompt and curteous. My fiancé works next to this location and one time they had ordered to go and the entire order was wrong ( a mix up between customers I'm sure) well Freddy's remade all their food even the fries which were fine to begin with, they gave them extra fries with that remade order and gave them 4 free combo meal coupons!  Way to make things right! I definitely suggest eating here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food and desserts were really good!  The fry sauce and seasoning make Freddy's stand out from the competition.  Unfortunately, there were employees everywhere in the dining room, which was something I've never seen before. We had to wait in line behind employees at the drink machine because they were filling their drinks up and headed back to the kitchen.  There were 2 booths of 4 employees each eating and talking loudly to each other. There were employees visiting these tables and talking loudly to each other from the kitchen.  Maybe there was a group meeting going on? Anyway- it was very distracting. The place is very well staffed though :). The tall male cashier was funny and was working the whole time. Ice cream service was very slow though. We'll visit again after a few months when things settle down."}
{"text":"WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  The burgers are as thin as paper, a crape, thin cardboard that you would find on a spiral note book cover!!!!! (WOW)

IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A \"STEAK CRAPE\" THIS IS THE PLACE TO GOOOOOOOO!!!!!

$14.00 for two \"Double Steak Crape\" burgers.

NEVER AGAIN!!!!
$$$$$$$$

P.S.  Too bad - stars are not an option!  This place should change their name to \"Steak Crapes\" or \"Paper Steak\"!!!!!! PATHETIC"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Freddy's in probably close to a year...not because I don't like it, but my wife is a bigger fan of Culver's.  I had a meeting that evening that caused me to miss at home dinner time and decided to hit up Freddy's for my dinner.  This was my first time through the drive-thru, all other visits had been inside.  Drive-thru, even though there was a steady stream of cars, was fairly quick.  

I ordered a double California Burger, with fries and a soda.  Now, I'll be honest, this was a few weeks back, and the fries and soda weren't that memorable...but the burger was fantastic.  Seemed meatier than normal (maybe that is in comparison to the usual Culver's burger?) and the taste was great.  Cooked as good as a fast-food burger can be cooked.  

Oh Freddy's, I like you so, hopefully I can ditch my wife more often to dine on your delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Vegas gets another new burger joint. I really was never going to go out of my way to eat at Freddy's, but because I happened to be on the side of town where it is located getting my nails done with my sister we decided to go here. I just so happened to see it when we were driving around.

The inside reminds me of an Inn N Out with obnoxiously nice employees. I know, how can employees be so nice they are obnoxious? When while in the course of being there for about 30 minutes and we are asked how everything is about 4 times. Okay, I'm complaining for nothing... I concede to the fact. But I am assuming the niceties will only last for so long, until Freddy's is just the 2nd Steak & Shake in Vegas.

Okay food - I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a soda, the combo. My sister ordered a hot dog and a water. We shared the fries - it's a good thing we did. The fry portions are massive, which basically does not surprise me anymore. They are shoestring fries though, kind of refreshing... as far as french fries goes.

My sister said her \"Chicago\" dog was tasty and good. My burger was good too. Now I've had the whole \"Steakburger\" thing. I don't know... is it better than other burgers? I just can't decide. I mean, it was good, but... uuuhhh, I just don't know. I'm just not really impressed.

Would I go back? Isn't that what it comes down to? When I go get my nails done and on that day I feel like a burger, perhaps I'll stop by Freddy's. But to go out of my way to come here? Nah. 

PS - They have fry sauce. Obvi everyone knows this is ketchup and mayo, but yea, still... FRY SAUCE."}
{"text":"In my opinion, I think they are better than Five Guys. I got the double bacon cheese burger & it was hot and delish! The staff were all very friendly & took our trays when we were done eating. We decided to get a frozen custard to take home and the girl at the register suggested the pumpkin custard. She said they take a whole slice of pumpkin pie and blend it with the frozen vanilla custard. So glad she suggested it because it was amazing! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went here for lunch today.  It's sort of like In and Out sort of, but  less crowded and more selections.

The food is tasty.  They are friendly.  A person kept coming around to clean up any messes, but not too frequently.  The menu had a good selection of burgers, philly cheesesteak, hot dogs.  They also had ice cream stuff, but I didn't look closely at this.

The fries were like shoestring, which we prefer bigger fries, but they gave a lot (a little too much).  

My husband had a burger.  He liked it.  My son had a chili dog.  He liked it.  I had a philly cheesesteak and I liked it.  Though, I would rather have a better cheese with it as this tasted like Velveeta."}
{"text":"My kids have been begging me for weeks to try this place. Since we were in the area running errands I decided to run through the drive thru real quick. The menu was pretty basic..steak burgers, chicken, and custard. I ordered the regular steak burger and fries. My kids both got the chicken finger meals. We got our food fairly quick, but after seeing what it looked like I wasn't too impressed. To me it was quite pricy for a basic put together hamburger. The fried to me were the best part. Shoestring style and came with fry sauce or ketchup. My kids enjoyed their chicken and were happy, but for $25 for 3 of us including one kids meal it wasn't enough for me to be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The WORST hamburger I think I have ever had. The patty reminded me of what is left when the hamburger sticks to the grill. No second chances here."}
{"text":"For fast food I will give them a 5!!!!!


 If OC didn't have a shit ton of burgeries LOL, I would wish them a chance to open here. But moments ago, I just found out a place called Waybacks opened up in Tustin and their patties look like Freddys soooooooo I may have to compare :p So I drove the family to Henderson to get work down on their house.  I saw Freddy's was in the same vicinity as our hotel so we had to try. I never had the chance to try the one in Victorville so this was perfect for me.  


 My sister and I came in for dinner while my mom rested. We walked in and the look was kind of like a diner mixed with Rallys colors lol. I noticed that all the employees were teens galore. I didn't see an adultish person back there so I was a little hesitant since teens don't really give a F about working in fast food unless it's Chic fil la or In and out LOL. I was wrong, these kids were great!  I was feeling greedy and I wanted to try as many things since I don't have one local to me LOL

  So I ordered the classic steakburger with the fries, a hot dog with mustard and ketchup, a bowl of chili and to take home a custard oreo cookie sandwich :D YOLO HAHA. My sister ordered a plain steakburger combo. Funny thing is, when she came with the food I noticed an extra basket of burger and fries . My sister took it back and they said keep it. SCORE!!!! Free food for moms LOL. I did my taste testing and I was SATISFIED!!!! The burger was fresh. The patty was flavorful and shined on it's own. The usual steak burger is topped with onions, pickles, cheese and mustard. I would have ordered the Cali style which is kind of a play on an In and out burger with 2 patties. But I wanted to try the classic. Next time I'll get the Cali . No complaints at all about my burger. Very solid especially for fast fast food. The hot dog was BOMB !!!! They  toast the buns and it's all buttery and just toasty goodness :D The frank was fresh as well and damn good. I'm boring with my wieners ( the edible ones that is ;)) So I only like ketchup and mustard.  The chili was my kind of chili. Like a true Texan. NO BEANS!!!  My favorite! It wasn't super greasy and tasted so good with crackers . I could only imagine how much better it would be with chili flakes mmmmm I'm a chili flake fiend. We left fat and happy. Later that night I broke into that custard Oreo ice cream sandwich. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be super fresh since these are prepackaged, WRONG again. Super fresh and the cookie was nice and chewy. I hate hard cookie ice cream sandwiches actually. So this was perfect. No frost bitten custard. I can't wait to try the Nutter butter one :D


  All and all , for drive thru fast food this was probably the most satisfying fast food meal I've ever had. Everything was consistently good and I've been dying to go back ever since! Another reason to visit my fam in Henderson LOL"}
{"text":"Great fries and great burgers. Even chicken fingers are pretty good. Drive though is a bit risky though. They always forget my fries or part of my order. I stopped using their drive thru due to this reason."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant months ago.  The burgers and fries are delicious, service is superb and plenty of tables to dine.  Recommend this place to anyone who likes to try something different besides eating McDonald's or Burger King burgers and fries."}
{"text":"First time coming here but won't be my last...thin cut fries are excellent, burger patties are cooked to perfection...dining area has that comfortable diner feel to it...customer service is phenominal...recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We like Freddy's food very much!  ALWAYS fresh and HOT when you get it!!!  Their custard ice cream desserts are very yummy as well!!!  Glad they came to Concord!!!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is my all-time favorite burger chain. I like it even better than In-N-Out. I love the shoestring fries. I love their burger patty and how thin they are. I think this is what McDonald's tasted like before they went big, then again, I wouldn't know since I wasn't around back then. I wish they would have a Freddy's near where I live."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!Great burgers & fries. And amazing chocolate malts. The chili cheese fries are also vey yummy. Its always super busy but we never wait long for our food. And everyone is always very nice there."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite burger place at the 4 corners here at Happy & Lake Pleasant.  I've stopped in twice since their opening on Tuesday and the place is packed at peak time still, so avoid those times!  I like the single cheeseburger which is 2 super thin patties so I took one off and it was great. Their spicy fry sauce is really where's it's at. I put it on everything but just the fries. I also got the Chicago style hotdog which was decent even with the grilled bun. The fries are delicious but little hard to eat because their so thin. The place has a dairy smell from the custard I guess which isn't my favorite but the food is good and the place is clean. This is my first time to a Freddy's so I do like it and will continue coming back. Still got to try a desert"}
{"text":"If i can give them 0 stars i would. I absolutely love their shakes and that is prolly the only reason why i go back. But everytime i order food the kids they hire seem to mess it up. They need a completely different staff an older one at that."}
{"text":"Why only 3 stars?  Good customer service, messy dining area, and not noticeably better than other stake-burger places.  Price is also a bit higher than comparable restaurants.  Be warned: I didn't get any custard and that could have been an important factor.

I ordered a two patty burger and I instead got a one patty burger.  This was actually very good.  As a result of the mistake I got to keep and eat the single patty burger and I got the correct two patty burger.  What had happened is my dining companion ordered a single patty version of my burger with fries, and then I ordered a double patty version without fries.  I also think she said no pickles and onions.  I am not sure if they just gave her my burger with the onions and all, but I believe they didn't.  She didn't want a second patty but extra beef isn't really a negative.  They also made my replacement burger lickity-split and brought it right to my table.

Conclusion: the difference between 1 and 5 stars for this type of restaurant is narrow in my opinion, they are all very 'samey.'"}
{"text":"Holy Cow this place is good!!! The steakburger is so basic but perfectly done and the vanilla custard shake is pure heaven. Why the crappy fries Freddy?? Why???"}
{"text":"i have been coming here for a while now and every time i come the manager on duty is here and the food is very good and made to order, i came here  for dinner the other night  around 9:45 and the cashier a hispanic young lady asked if i wanted it in a to go box because they will be closing. only drive thru is open , even though there was people eating inside i felt like she was kicking me out!but to top it off when i got home a few hours later i puked all my food up! very bad i hope things change this use to be my favorite burger spot not anymore the cooks and managers are no good"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant staff.  Good food and a diner like atmosphere.   Being from Chicago, I wish it where a tad more like Ed Debevichs.  But it's good!!!"}
{"text":"My second fave burger destination. Love their burgers which are thin, have a nice crust/caramelization, and are juicy...just tasty!  Awesome shoestring fries. A little pricy, though."}
{"text":"This is our go-to burger and custard restaurant. Very clean, friendly service, including 50's rock and roll."}
{"text":"The fries here are to die for and the burgers definitely have a different taste and texture than you might find at another fast food type joint, but that's the appeal and they are good! Always make sure to get the fry sauce, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Great burgers and frys.  Meat taste super fresh and best fries in town.  Better to order a double or triple burger to get plenty of meat. Service is top noche for a fast food place.  Several times staff walked by to check on me.  Highly recommend this place if your a burger fan."}
{"text":"First time in here. Burger was done fast and was good.  Fries are now my favorite fast food fries.  Very thin shoestring.  Next time I'll leave room to try the ice cream but this place is a keeper. Only 4 stars because it is a little pricey. Not terrible but good is on point so I don't mind paying a little more for good food"}
{"text":"Blows In & Out out of the water. Burgers are great, their onion rings and fry sauce are phenomenal and their shakes are better than Mr Lucky's at The Hard Rock. Best overall burger joint I've been to in Henderson.

And yes, the drive thru is a little long.  BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY COOKING YOUR FOOD RIGHT THEN."}
{"text":"Some might walk into Freddy's and think.. \"Hey this is like Culvers..\"   Sure, they both sell burgers and custard, but I tell ya what..  Freddy's burgers are far tastier and the custard is out of this world.  How's that for an 80s commercial?

I got a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  I had no idea their fries were shoestring, but I loved them even more.  You can get carried away with fries and end up stuffing yourself.  These work just right.  I added some of their special seasoning on top and went to town. 

Only bad thing was when I have a good burger, I can usually inhale the thing in about a minute.. the burger was gone in about 90 seconds.  Sorry! it was good!!   My girlfriend leaned over and said to me after I ate it.. \"really??\"  I know..  Sue me. It was good.

If I had to compare it to anything, id say Smashburger.  Which I also love.  

For dessert I had a great medley of custard, caramel, chocolate and pecans.. MMmmm.. super good."}
{"text":"The 2 star is mostly for service mostly. While friendly enough, if you're gonna charge me for extra lettuce (yeah I know it's only $.15 but the point is you're charging) and you put only two little sprigs extra on the sandwich then there's a problem. And when I tried to bring this to their attention the woman just molested my burger saying there's lettuce underneath. Obviously but I asked for extra and was charged and you didn't put 'extra' on there. This has been an on going battle with them. While I've liked their food I'm kind of over this place and the comprehension of what extra lettuce is when being charged. The last straw was the woman molesting my burger. I was out done then. Doubt I'll be going back. At least not to this location."}
{"text":"Have now tried this place 3 times and have finally given up on it.  All 3 times they have messed up at least one item on our order.  This last time we ordered concretes; they were very slow to come out (through the drive- thru) and were more soup than ice cream they were so melted, and one was missing one of the ingredients that was ordered. 3 strikes and you're out!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I wasn't expecting much when I saw this place go up. Another \"specialty\" burger joint in Vegas... Oh,  yippee joy! 

What I found was an amazingly fresh burger (cooked to order). The pickles were a nice touch (long, bun length) and the bun was toasted just right! My only knock is that the bacon was just ok and you need to add some sauce to the burger as mustard was the only thing on there. But, Im sure if you play around with it you'll find your perfect way. First impression thought is that It still lacks in the signature taste department compared to In N Out, but this is the best #2 I've found... And that's saying a lot! 

The custard was to die for! Tried a turtle sundae and I wasn't disappointed at all. I think next time it will be the Hawaiian one... Actually, it will be up to the wife to choose the next one so who knows!

The place was clean, the people were friendly and very inviting. Way different then other \"steak burger\" places in Vegas located in or near Southpoint Casino. 

I will totally be back!!"}
{"text":"Ended up going here because it replaced Fazoli's. I ordered the double California burger. Pretty much the nastiest, greasiest burger I've ever had. The bottom bun was so soaked with grease, I had to take it off and eat it upside-down. I ended up throwing out three-quarters of it and still feel like I might vomit. The shoestring fries were alright but I was so disgusted by the burger, I could not finish them. My husband said that his double cheeseburger was also pretty gross. All in all, I can say that we were both very disappointed and definitely will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after hearing about Freddy's so I was super excited to see this new burger place in town. We came in and my friend ordered a double steak burger and I ordered their patty melt and a double steak burger to go since the boyfriend was stuck at home :)

The food was really good, I  thought their patty melt was tasty and I loved their fries. I actually tried the burger later that day when I delivered the BF the food and that was super tasty. Their fry sauce was just alright, sorta generic tasting but we LOVED that they have it on tap, like ketchup!! 

We did end up sharing their turtle custard cup, and I was hesitate to get custard from a chain restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised!! Yum! Plus, they had super friendly employees which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Seen this place while driving around the area looking at homes lol.. So glad we found this place! Burgers, Hot Dogs, straw fries w/fry sauce & frozen custard are all Smackin! Straight Grubbs & will come back for sure. Very clean new place & friendly service, lots of parking. Freddie's is a Kansas fast food treat in AZ!"}
{"text":"Veteran owned company 
Best food and service #1 combo DELICIOUS  I love coming here the lady at the counter is from Germany (super polite and professional) two Freddy's in less than month. 1st one in California this one in AZ. Hoping for one closer to Dallas TX !!  Thanks Freddy's God bless you and thank you for your service!!!"}
{"text":"The shoestring fries are fantastic! and I love the turtle or the Hawaiian Sundaes!"}
{"text":"Thank so much to Freddy's! You really know how to make a guy feel at home. I just moved here from St. Louis. There is this place called Carl's Drive in back home... No not Carl's Jr.. That I was sorely sad about leaving. Well your burger put that sadness to sleep. Tastes just like theirs. Thank you again."}
{"text":"Totally impressed! We aren't big on fast food in my family but we decided to try Freddy's burgers anyway since I didn't feel like cooking. I was pleasantly surprised that their food wasn't covered in grease and it tasted good too! Next time we will try the frozen treats! :-)"}
{"text":"This place continues to get my drive thru order wrong time and time again! Luckily tonight I peeked in the bag before pulling away.  Cheeseburger was supposed to be plain--had everything on it. No cheese sauce for the fries and well I should have looked close at my fried pickles bc they were a soggy mess. I've called the manager before and called again! I keep telling them I don't want free food or comps I just want to come to the drive thru and get what I order. I don't think it's that hard of a task yet it never gets better. If it weren't for the skinny fries and custard I would just stop coming here all together. Please get it together Freddys! Oh and when they corrected my burger my fries got cold waiting in the line for a new burger! Please stop failing me Freddys!"}
{"text":"ATTENTION MANAGEMENT OF THIS STORE PLEASE READ: 

We came here for dinner Saturday night around 7. Walked up to the register to order and the girl behind the counter was making ice cream sandwiches and putting them in bags to put in the freezer up front for customers to buy. She was wearing gloves and when she took our order she left her gloves on, took our cash and gave us change then went back to holding the ice cream sandwiches with the same gloves she was just handling the money with! She did this over and over as new customers came in. I could hardly believe my eyes it was so gross! Their food is normally hot and good and I love their ice cream but this ruined my appetite... I'd hate to see what goes on behind the scene if this is happening right in front of everyone. Maybe some people are clueless how dirty money is?! I won't be ordering any ice cream sandwiches from there anytime soon!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service provided by Jacob and Vanessa last night through the drive-thru! We had a large order and they took care of us so promptly! Once you have custard, you lose taste for ice cream and froyo, its flavor it unmatched and Freddy's always satisfies a sweet tooth! 
They offer a steak burger that my husband always order, me myself at more of a Chicago dog person but his burger always looks delicious! I love the shoestring fries with fry sauce. 
The Hawaiian delight concrete is my weakness. Hawaii in a dessert shake."}
{"text":"Really meaty and juice burger. I'd say it's better than Shake Shack. Lost a star because the fries suck since they are so thin. I prefer thicker fries that aren't like eating chips"}
{"text":"Had the A-1 burger with the fried pickles. Quick and friendly service and food was good. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Never been to Freddy's before but after today...Ima be coming here for my burger fixes! Burgers are bomb, fries be fire! & the fry sauce is bomb dot com!!! Lmfaooo can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and efficient staff. Ordered a #1 combo (double burger with fries and drink). To me the burger didn't have much seasoning and the fries were bland. Maybe I was just having an off night but was not a big fan of this place. Might be back to try the custard when we have time."}
{"text":"I often forget about this place. But a friend suggested we take our kids there while our husband's were out of town and we had the best time ever. The food was so good and I love that they have yummy ice cream options for dessert all in one stop!! It's very kid and family-friendly. Or perfect for an adult dessert night!! Everyone was so nice and friendly! I will definitely be going back more often!"}
{"text":"Little diner-style burger joint that I personally prefer over any burger restaurant that has a drive through. 
Also, Freddys is one of few burger drive throughs around that offers a vegetarian burger combo.
Steak burgers are thin and stacked to create a traditional sized burger, shoe string french fries salted and \"fry sauce\" for dipping. \"freddy's sauce\" (1000 island) and freddy's seasoning are always branded flavors of the reetaurant. If you're in the area, on a time crunch, give it a go! Good stuff indeed!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'd say this place is good, but not over the top good! The burgers are about average and the fries are really nothing special..kind of tasteless! I didn't try the frozen custard, however, but I did hear its pretty good!!! The staff at this location is soooo sweet! They always smile at me and make conversation! This bumped my 2 star rating to a 3!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here about once a week. We always get the single combo. Love it! Huge portion of fries and the burgers are fantastic! I love the fry sauce. Customer service is always great, they always welcome you when you come up to the counter. They walk around while you are eating to see if you need anything or if they can take your tray or trash for you. Wonderful. We will be going back."}
{"text":"After many attempts to give Freddy's Indian Land, SC location time \"work out their kinks\"; I just can't continue to patronize this location.  On two separate purchases through the drive-thru and getting home with an incorrect order - no bacon after being charged for it,  I went inside to place my order at the counter.  I was extremely clear that I wanted a  plain single cheeseburger  with  bacon combo and a chili hotdog with fries.  What was in my bag? A cheeseburger with all the fixing and a chili hotdog with onions.  I knew to check before leaving and asked that the order be remade.  The counter person didn't offer an apology or provide any type of customer service.  Since my fries were already in the bag and I had wait for my food to be remade, you'd think they would have atleast offered some hot fries. I'm done!"}
{"text":"Drove by and thought I would check it out. As mentioned by someone else in a review, the burger was very thin. Mine was crunchy. Not the kind of noise you wanna hear when you bite into a burger. The bun was ok. I like that they buttered it up, but a sesame seed bun would have been a whole lot tastier. 

The service was good. No complaints there. A lot of people clearing tables and delivering food. They keep the place pretty clean, especially with all the people going in and out while I was there.

For a fast burger, MUCH better than 5 guys. But nearly close to in n out."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries!!! I love the freddys sauce and the shoestring fries. The chocolate custard is amazing! One time I forgot my wallet and they gave me my meal for free... Overall great customer service and food!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here are pretty good, but the custard sundaes and concret mixers are amazing. The PBC & B i will go back for over and over again as well as try the other items. Great place."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've driven by Freddy's and thought about stopping there... only to keep driving. Well, that all changed a couple of weeks ago. Now, I'm wondering why I took so long to actually try it.

The burgers are awesome! They have a unique flavor to them that is really hard to beat (probably because they are steakburgers). I'm also a big fan of their cheese fries and their fry sauce is a must! It does take a little while to get through the drive-thru, but it's totally worth the wait. The staff is always super nice, which is an added bonus in today's world."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food burger hands down. I picked one up out of convenience, and was really impressed with the flavor and quality. I have been back plenty! It is pricey, but I would rather pay more for good quality beef which this is. I get cravings for this place! I haven't tried anything but the burgers but the burgers are worth it!"}
{"text":"With delicious steakburgers and custards that will rock you, currently Freddy's is the champion of fast food steakburgers in the Sunset Station area. This location is one of the only three Freddy's within a few hours of Las Vegas. The other two are on Eastern Avenue at Silverado and Victorville, California. 

  Freddy's menu says it best: \"The taste that will bring you back.\" Freddy's steakburgers have a deliciousness that bring my taste buds all the way above the stratosphere to Mercury. My food of choice has been the double steakburger California style with regular fries and medium coke for $7.79 and the bacon & cheese double steakburger with regular fries and medium coke for $8.19. This is a fantastic value for under $10 and has to be putting the competition under pressure. In comparison to some of the fast food chains, Freddy's makes the burgers fresh. In my opinion their steakburgers are just as good as the higher priced Five Guys Burgers. Everything from the meat to the onions tasted fresh. The fries are also good. Freddy's fries are the skinny style. The combos overflow with fries. I was also impressed with their peanut butter concrete. There was the right amount of vanilla custard and peanut butter topping.

  When I eat out I want it all and I want it now. Actually I appreciate friendly and attentive customer service. The kind of customer service that makes Freddy's a champion. All three times that I have dined here, they greeted me right away. The easy to understand menus with one size is another example of good customer service. I appreciate that Freddy's steered away from the practice of increasing quality with pricing tiers like Firehouse does. After paying, I took my drink to the beverage fountain and waited for them to call out my number. Customer service is so attentive here that they have volunteered to dump my tray as I walked toward the trash can. The ultimate customer service occurred tonight. I was enjoying my steakburger when a friendly woman who works here presented me with a complimentary peanut butter concrete. I never saw this at a McDonald's. Then again McDonald's does not offer the outstanding concrete and custards that Freddy's does. The staff is fast. They cook up delicious food very quickly. This is a kind of magic when you take into consideration that Freddy's was happening on Friday night. The menu ought to also say, \"The service that will bring you back.\"

   Freddy's has upped the standard further in Las Vegas fast food. They serve quality food made fresh with a smile and determination. Some of the fast food competitors that fail to raise their standard may get a sheer heart attack when their locations bite the dust. Freddy's just like In N Out and many of the newer fast food chains have raised the bar on fast food dining. Freddy's is the rising star. Just like the menu says, \"it has a taste that will bring you back.\""}
{"text":"This is basically a cleaner Steak n Shake! They do not have waiters it is a pick up order and seat yourself place (they also have a drive thru). The burgers are ok a bit salty as well as the fries. Didn't try the custard but the food was meh. Could have had a cookout combo for half the price!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm great custard,burgers are good and fries are my favorite!!! Employees are friendly and seem to enjoy their job!!"}
{"text":"A decent burger chain, the nice thing about this chain is that they have a good sized dessert menu.  They have a variety of custards, shakes, cakes, and malts.  But their main thing is still their burgers.

The Freddy's Original double with cheese is pretty good.  They do thin and bigger patties.  The flavor is standard and not too oily, nothing special in my opinion but a solid burger.  The fries are the thin type, which I like and they have fry seasoning you can add after too which is nice.

The new Philly cheesesteak is a bit dry for my taste and could use a bit more meat.  The cheese sauce on top is pretty good and helps make the sandwich.  

The turtle custard is yummy, a nice way to top off the meal!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place. Hamburgers are always excellent.  Custard out of this world.  
Fries, cheese fries when we got them they were COLD, way too much cheese in my cheese fries that they were soggy.  But I go there for the Hamburgers the meat hangs over the bun and they are always fresh the seasoning really good. 
Wish there was one closer."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm midday impressed with the impeccable customer service. Everyone is so friendly and eager to serve their patrons. I'm a business owner myself so I can appreciate great management skills and the hard work of their employees. As a consumer I very much appreciate the effort put into making me happy when I'm here. The wait is never long either. The food always comes out hot and fresh. All the workers have a smile on their face and a bounce in their step. All in all a total pleasure to eat here."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick meal.  Wish there was just a little bit more me to the burger.  Staff seems friendly and outgoing.  Even met the owners and they were very sweet.  Kids love the custard!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm yummy! This place is a slice of heaven! It has a 50's style theme, thing Johnny Rockets or 5 & Diner. Great service, friendly staff and a large fast food menu to choose from. THe portion sizes are HUGE so if you dont want to leave overly stuffed share with a friend. I had their philly cheese steak sandwhich and chili cheese fries...... mmmmmm! Lets just say my mom had to roll me outta there when I was done eating! Stop bye you dont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"We first encountered Freddy's on a trip to the midwest - somewhere in Kansas as I recall. It is great that Freddy's has made it to North Carolina, because they are some tasty eats. The burger itself reminds you of Smashburger or perhaps Steak and Shake, so if you're not familiar, it's on the thin side. Fries are also thin.

Even better, you can order Frozen Custard - you can get it when you order your burger (ask them to put it \"on hold\", then you just release it later) or you can get it later, but you'll need to stand in line and order/pay for it.

The downside to this location of Freddy's is that it can be a bit of a challenge to get to, since it's across from Concord Mills, and turning left in order to get to them can be a challenge, especially at certain hours, but one you're there, it is all good. Also, anything other than a burger may not be ideal - while they have chicken, hot dogs and even a veggie burger, the burgers are definitely the star here."}
{"text":"My son & I have been here twice and really appreciate the fine customer service and tasty custards! Fries are really dine perfectly too!"}
{"text":"In n Out and Steak n Shake fell in love and Freddies was born! Honestly Freddies is better than either. A very flavorful burger, fries with the seasoning and sauce were amazing and they have some serious portions with their thickest ever custards. Seriously the mini size is desert enough for most. My family and I will be back!"}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure. Sometimes you just crave a burger. A good juicy steakburger loaded with the stuff you like, a big pile of onion rings or crispy fries, and a shake or dessert to top it off. Freddy's takes care of your cravings, perhaps a little too well. 

Service: I always get service with a smile here, even at the drive-up window. 
Price: Yeah, it's not McDonalds but if you've lived in the Midwest, aka cattle country and you've got a craving for beef, you won't be disappointed coming here. 

If you're one of those people that likes concretes, you need to come here. They have them, and they are really good. Ok, it's not as good as Ted Drewes's famous concretes in St. Louis, but they'll take care of your sweet tooth quite nicely. 

3 Stars...almost gave them 4. Got kids? My kid and his friends never complain when we come here...especially when they know they're getting ice cream too."}
{"text":"My Freddy's experiences are like high school dating. The first time out was awesome. It was like she could do no wrong and everything was good. But the second date, or in this case a visit is the one where you quickly learn she's not a keeper and she's got some real annoyances that makes you glad when she gets out of the car and you can drive away. I like Freddy's...the hamburgers are flavorful and the service is fast, but things are not quite as they should be. The California steakburgers sound good but beyond the steakburger itself it's just lacking flavor. Perhaps changing the toppings might help. And the onion rings this time were hard to chew, and in one case didn't seem to be quite fully cooked as if the staff was rushing the orders. 

But as I write this I have to call out their concrete as a failure. When I think of a concrete for dessert my mind instantly compares it with one of America's standardbearers, Ted Drewes frozen custard off Historic Route 66 in St. Louis, Missouri. They offer a simple test for a concrete. Turn the cup upside down. If it stays put it's legit. If it starts to run and drip it's a pretender. My Freddy's cup maybe got to 120 degrees of rotation before failing miserably. And while the Hawaiian was supposed to have pineapple and macadamia nuts and other goodies in it, this concrete was boring. So much so that I dumped it in the trash. 

Will I go back? Yeah, but In-N-Out will likely see my car in their drivethrough ordering Animal style before Freddy's does. 

3 Stars. Sorry but it's the best I can give."}
{"text":"Just based on the frozen custard I have had here, I give them four stars. I haven't had any other food here, but hopefully will, some day.
The frozen custard is amazing! They have a lot of \"blizzard\" like varieties, my favorite being the Hawaiian and Turtle. The Turtle wins though.
Service can be really slow at times. One time we went in with our order for 4 custards and we were waiting there for 15 minutes. Not sure what was taking them so long but at one point we saw the girl making our custard dump everything out and someone else took over. It still tasted good though, so there's that."}
{"text":"Great staff and excellent burgers and fries.  I'm having a #5 today,  a pretty Melt and Shoestring fries that are delicate and thin, very tasty."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today. Had the chicago dog with fries and a few bites of the steakburger (Not that I wouldnt have eaten more)

The fries are awesome here! I love the thin shoestring fries. The dog was good, it was on a great bun. No complaints at all!

I had a few bites of the steakburger from my girlfriend. She wouldnt let me eat it all! HAHA

So I was done eating and was like oh what the hell lets get the custard.... I tried the brownie delight= Delicious. Very smooth and probably the best frozen \"ice cream\" I've ever tried. 

I will be back and will make a special trip to try more stuff!!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Freddy's! One of my favorite burger places, clean eating areas, friendly service, good hot food!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.   We would have normally passed this little gem right on by.   This is a fast food establishment in the land of fatburgers, in-n-out, jacks, Carl's jr., Etc...   none of these are in New York, but we love them all.   So, stopping into Freddy's was pure luck.  The burgers were delicious.  The shoestring fries tasty and fresh.  We finished it off with a sundae.   Everything was delicious.   We will be back here again before going home.   Also, if they still have the hatch chili burger, give it a try.   The flavors blend perfectly."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. First time here and the food is amazing. The food came out nice and hot. I was surprised, the food was ready within 3-4 mins of ordering.  Had the triple steakburger California style and the concrete with hot caramel.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just went with my husband and brother tonight for about the 3rd time-We LOVE this place!!!  Every time we go, the food is good and the staff is very friendly, and it's always very clean.  I'm pretty picky about my burgers, but even when I don't feel like a burger these always taste good.  I definitely recommend this place for their frozen custard or hamburgers and fries!"}
{"text":"For a fast food place it's good
I don't eat red meat, and it just looked so good I went for it
I ordered a double cheeseburger and it was awesome
I ordered the vanilla frozen custard with sprinkles and it was pretty good
But very fattening 
Glad we got one here in henderson"}
{"text":"Really? I got a concrete paid for extra Oreo, when she handed it to me I questions it so she took it back and asked the manager, who had it remade, and this is what I got! Less then before. The fact that they charge .70 for extra. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Freddy's to get some dessert. 

I absolutely love the frozen custard here. As we walked up, I noticed a sign for a seasonal item, pumpkin pie concrete! I decided that was what I wanted from the parking lot. 

Walked in and was immediately greeted by an associate who welcomed us with a smile. We ordered and browsed the pre-made cakes and custard cookie sandwiches while we waited. 

Noticed that one associate was sweeping up while another wiped down tables, keeping the place nice and clean. 

The pumpkin pie concrete was literally like pumpkin pie in a cup, complete with pie crust and whipped cream. It was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Our order was for 1 single patty melt, grilled onion, swiss cheese, 1 double cheese burger with bacon no pickles, 1 order on fries.  What we got 1no cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, raw onions.  2nd burger  everything okay but there was pickles on it. We got 2 orders of fries and a hot dog.   Obviously the gal with the braided pig tails DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO CKECK THE ORDER.  I bet the car behind us got our order.  Just adding a note they were not busy.  SO NOW WE WILL HAVE TO CHECK ALL DRIVE THRU ORDERS--- SAD SAD SAD  
:("}
{"text":"Terrible.  They call this a hamburger or a steak burger ?    It's a layer of grizzle with some ground beef in it.   Terrible.  I want to post pics"}
{"text":"So I've been back at least once a week since my last review for Freddy's.  Yes, you can say I am freakin addicted to this place.  I don't normally type more than one reviews for the same place, especially if the rating stays the same.  Unless, you give me that perfect exceptional experience each time consistently.

What prompt this five stars again besides their consistent A++++++++ service, quality of foods, cleanliness, price, etc etc etc.  is their OUTSTANDING chicken sandwich I had for the first time.

It was a nice treat after a horrible experience I had earlier this week at Arby's (read that one star review for details).  

Anyway, back to the perfection chicken sandwich I had at Freddy's. I normally go to Chik-Fil-A  for chicken sandwiches because they actually have the same quality taste and services.  However, now that I have Freddy's chicken sandwich, I will most likely be coming here now anytime I crave an outstanding chicken sandwich.

Personally, in my opinion, this place is so well deserved for a five stars that I would pay Steakhouse prices for a meal here. To be quite honest, they actually have better beer battered onion rings and best French fries than most Steakhouses.   

Tips: Just fyi, if you like your grilled onions lightly cooked, you have to ensure the cashier go out of their way to tell the cook.  Cause everytime I tell them I wanted my onions lightly cooked, they made it too well done for me.  I found out that it was like that because they are pre grilled.  The cashier I had today went out of her way to tell the cook and it made a significant difference and made our sandwiches 100 times better.  Didn't think it can be better.  See you next week Freddy's."}
{"text":"I hate to say it..... better than In-n-Out burgers. The fries are excellent too. The \"concrete\" deserts (kind of like a very thick milkshake) are awesome. The fry sauce and burger seasonings are a nice touch. The service is great with friendly helpful staff that give you their full attention. Give it a try! Don't pass this one up."}
{"text":"By now we've visited Freddys at least a dozen times or more. The staff is always friendly, the environment is always clean and upbeat, and the food is always consistently good. Fyi, we're pretty addicted to their fries, not sure why but they're so damn good. Maybe the seasoning is laced with crack, I don't know but they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food, service was awesome, and the chocolate shake, THE BOMB.. Prices we're great as well, and clean"}
{"text":"Freddys wins the award for best milkshake from a fast food restaurant! The chocolate shake was awesome. It had quality chocolate, not the cheap squeezy bottle kind. It was thick, but they gave you a nice fat straw that worked well. They also had appropriate cheese fries. They came with a cheese sauce versus melted cheese that gets too hard right away. The fries were thin cut and tasty. I tried the Chicago dog also. It was a quality hotdog with multiple toppings. Be careful with the peppers, they were very spicy. The relish was sweet so it was a nice offset. The patty melt had 2 delicious beef patties that were well seasoned. It came on rye bread with caramelized onions and cheese. If you are a fan of In-N-Out burger like I am, you need to try this place. It gives them a run for their money!"}
{"text":"Gotta say I don't care for, or eat, anything but the custard at Freddy's.  It is hands down the best frozen custard I have ever had anywhere.  If you love ice cream you will love Freddy's."}
{"text":"They have veggie burger!!! Although the textures kinda dry, but I would like to go back to this place for 'no-meat' burger!
The french fries was great!!!"}
{"text":"This Freddy's just opened to decided to go there today. It was what you would expect from Freddy's. It was good. The fries could have been a bit hotter, but I tend to like my fries to be burn your fingers fresh."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place JUST opened and the service is pretty fast considering. Came in on a Saturday around 1230 and had my food in less than 5 mins. Went for the single burger and kudos to this place for not putting ketchup on their burgers as a standard condiment! The group I was with also had the California burger and the chicken tenders (2nd favorite thing here). Shoe strings fries are crispy and a good portion. A welcome addition to Peoria!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The food is great and the service is as well. The steak burgers are pretty impressive. I only wish that the dessert browny was warmed up. The staff came over and asked us how our experience was and to help clean up. I love Freddy's!"}
{"text":"Fries, burger, dirt n worms. its all good. the burgers are a bit small but the taste is there. of course their sauce is on point as well. they have these nutter butter ice cream sandwiches also that i love, you can get it in oreo form as well."}
{"text":"Food was good as always and the cashier was bright and cheerful but after finishing my burger I ordered a concrete sundae and it took over 20 minutes for them to make it. 

Maybe if the place was packed I would understand why it might take a while but the diner was barely at 30% capacity so I'm not sure what took so long. Maybe the drive-thru was busy but still."}
{"text":"I Was Immediately Impressed With The Friendly Staff and How Clean the Restaurant Is!!

 Our order was placed with the friendly Janay who patiently waited to take our order, and even offered up some good suggestions for us newcomers. I'm pretty picky so I told her how I wanted my burger to have this, but not that, yet California style etc. She kindly said, \" Not a problem, and said they can make it happen.\" Excellent Customer Service!! 

The menu offers cheeseburgers, double cheeseburgers, chicken fingers, chicken sandwiches and the basics, french fries, onion rings with the bonus fried pickles for those who like, as well as some cool desert choices.

Food was exactly what we ordered, another plus for me!! Burgers were cooked to perfection. The shoestring type french fries were warm and good. The freddy sauce was delicious, reported by many at our table. :)

During our meal I noticed the employee who took our order cleaning tables and diligently make sure the tables were actually \"CLEAN!!\" I appreciated seeing an employee actually  take pride in her work. Very nice!  5 star service!!

I definitely recommend this location based on Cleanliness, Friendly Service , Good Food and reasonable prices. Nice change up from the \"Other\" burger places.

 Hope you or your family are as happy as we were to give this place a try. :) We definitely will be back.  Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are decent, and the concrete's are great. I like that if you order a concrete or sundae they will hold it back till you are ready for it so it won't melt. Another thing about the concrete's are that they are huge. The few times we've been there I've needed to share the smallest size because it is too much custard.

The unfortunate side to Freddy's in my opinion is that their chili tastes canned (I know it's from a can, but not everywhere tastes like straight up Hormel chili from a can, which is nasty), the fries suck and are flavorless, unless greasy is the flavor you are going for, and if you order the chili cheese fries they come standard with a gross cheese sauce and in order to get real cheese you have to psychically know that real cheese is an option that you can ask for. 

Honestly this place is ok, not great, but definitely better than the other steak burger and shake place near it."}
{"text":"as far as fast food and diner experience goes, this place is paramount. just had the patty melt made with fry sauce and it literally melted in my mouth. the shoe string fries are totes adores. And if you are a connoisseur of condiments such as I am, the fry sauce will excite you! Also  the ice cream will help any fix."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!  Our first visit, and Chris, the General Manager, greeted us and made us feel at home.  The service is exceptional, and steak burgers are delicious!  Great restaurant and make sure you have the custard....it is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Frozen custard. It's in the restaurant's name. That means they must specialize in this menu item. I'm happy to say this place lives up to its name. 
This review and rating  is based strictly on their frozen custard dessert items because I haven't tried any other items. 
I've never tried frozen custard before but I love custards in their standard form so I figured It would be similar. It's not. It's SSSOOOOO much better! 
The custard is rich, creamy and the perfect balance of sugar and cream. Thicker than the soft serve ice cream  of DQ but still pliable on a spoon. It was delicious! Just writing this review makes me wanna go back for a second order. Treat yourselves and try some!"}
{"text":"There are some employees that are really  rude and disrespectful and my ice cream is always melted before I even get to eat it they have one job like honestly."}
{"text":"Good day friends! CFC here with YET ANOTHER restaurant review!

You all know by now that I'm a Chicago transplant, so when I saw a sign advertising \"Chicago style Hotdogs\" while driving down Eastern in search of feed... I immediately thought, \"Oh no. This is dangerous. If they screw this up I'm going to have go on Yelp and TEAR em' apart! Don't me do this!\" and I'll do it... I've done it!  

But, thankfully, this didn't have to happen.  :-)

I'll say flat out that the hotdog wasn't \"Gene & Judes good\", but it was definitely good. As soon as I took the first bite, a memory swept across my mind... leaving Hot Doug's on California, hooking a right on Addison, I was heading home again! The right toppings, which of course includes pretty much everything but ketchup (don't you dare), a nice buttered up bun and most importantly... the right kind of dog. You have to hear the \"break\"... and you do! Real Chicago Hotdog lovers know exactly what I mean by \"hearing the break\".

The fries were just alright. I tend to like a thicker french fry so I'm not going to dock them for that as it's a matter of personal preference. I will definitely be back for the dogs and I will be trying the steakburger and frozen custard next time. 

Regards,
CFC"}
{"text":"We arrived here before checking into the Hotel.
We ordered the California steakburger meal, chocolate shake and frozen custard.

I took a tiny bite of Randys burger and was floored by quality and tastw. The fries were crispy and piping hot, best frozen custard.ever.

They need to come out to San Jose."}
{"text":"Great food, brand new location and the service is super friendly. Very conveniently located next to a grocery store as well. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my french fries and this place does them right! The fries were thin and crispy.. Just the way I like it. It was my first time here a couple days ago and the place is super cute. It reminds me of a 50's diner. Friendly cashiers and there's always someone that walks around and checks up on you even though it's an order at the window and pay then pick up your food kind of concept. I decided to try the patty melt and added tomatoes and lettuce. The toast was crispy and soft on the inside with lots of flavor. Patty itself was juicy and the carmelized onions was the perfect touch. I couldn't really taste what kind of cheese it was but the cheese tasted more like mayo for some reason. Maybe there was mayo in the sandwich too. But definitely add lettuce and tomatoes. It made the sandwich tastes more fresh. I'll definitely be back to try their burger!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for several years and have yet to be disappointed with either the food or the service, so they definitely earn a solid 5-stars from me. 

My wife and I both absolutely love their dessert, in particular the Dirt N'Worms and the Hawaiian Delight sundaes, but just about every flavor of the frozen custard is out-of-this-world good. I have never had better and was surprised to find something so insanely good at a fast food chain (albeit a smaller, lesser known one). 

As for the rest of the food, I'm a huge fan of the Steak Burger and their #1 combo is a staple of mine when I'm in there. My wife and I have both enjoyed their chicken breast sandwich as well and it is hands down one of the best you can get at a fast food chain anywhere in Phoenix, especially for this price range. 

Definitely not your typical fast-food fare and well worth a try if you want something quick and exceptionally good, but still fast-food-ish. The frozen custard alone is reason enough to go there, but there's so much more to like about this place. I will absolutely continue eating at this location and cannot recommend it enough, it totally lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"As a burger and fries place I give it 2 stars.  Thin, over-cooked burger patties and fries cut too small.   I know this is their classic style but I don't like it.

Their frozen custard is first rate though.

My advice is just go there for the FC."}
{"text":"My family still visits this location on our annual visit....it has not ever diaappointed. Grilled chicken (lettuce wrapped!), steak burger, fried pickles, everything is outstanding....oh yeah and the custard, of course!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries!   A bit pricy, but once in a while it is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited the warm springs location 
On Sunday. The food was perfect,
The service was above par.
Thanks! See you soon."}
{"text":"I am sad to say after wanting so badly to try this place; we hated it.  The fry sauce was good though.  I would go back and buy a bottle of fry sauce, to use with fries from somewhere else.  

With \"steak\" in the name of the place, I would have thought the meat to be sooo much better!  Wrong.  Plain, boring, small, skimpy, meh. Fries were skinny and greasy, the end! 

I didn't order dessert, so maybe this should be a dessert place and not a burger place."}
{"text":"Good steak burgers. I would rate it a notch above Steak 'n Shake but I grew up around Steak 'n Shake and only have known Freddy's for about 5 years. They are very similar to me."}
{"text":"Super awesome food I get the cheese burger and the meat is great also the service is awesome when ever you need some thing they will be on it love this place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time. We just went through the drive through since we had looked at the menu available online beforehand. 

Ordered the CA double combo. Since I thought double would be too much I requested it be made a single. (Because no single patty burgers were options on the menu.) the patty had a great grilled burger taste and not greasy. BUT their patties are super thin and flat...hence why everything on the menu is advertised as DOUBLE. Which had I known I would not have requested for a single pattie burger. I know now... double burgers are not big!! Also they have show string fries which were tasty, but al the ones we got were tiny fry bits. Possibly because it was in the evening and those were the dry leftovers? To say those came up a little short, literally, the overall quality and food was good!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers and of course their fry sauce which I believe is mayo, ketchup, and their french fry seasoning not sure. Any how I wish they would make the fries bigger but other than that so good!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is a great place to grab a quick meal.  It has a retro-diner kind of feel, with black and white patterned tile and red vinyl seats, but it's fast food so you can order at the counter or through the drive-thru.

I haven't had their \"famous\" steak burger, but their veggie burger is delicious.  It comes piled high with toppings and accompanied by skinny seasoned fries (if you get the combo).

Their frozen custard is wonderful as well, and they have a huge variety of mix-ins to choose from.  I got toasted coconut!  Mmmmm!

5 stars easy!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this Freddy's because it's closer to my house. BIG mistake. The staff was incredibly rude and incompetent. I had to repeat my order 5 times for them and then had to remind them to give me part of my order. The service, if you even can call it that, was incredibly slow. The employees clearly did not want to be there and made it obvious. I will definitely not be returning. If you're thinking of going here, don't, go to the one on 77th Ave and Bell instead."}
{"text":"Walked in was greeted . always a good sign. 

First time here so the guy at the counter was very nice and gave some ideas on what was liked by the people.

Went with the double steak burger and chill fries. 

And had to have some ice cream :) 

Food was out of sight. I got the feeling as it was like the place steak and shake. But have this place so close to home. Its great will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Freddie's for awhile. This location does not care for customers . the management is bad. Heaven gebre is the GM here at this location. She needs to be let go. The training is poor. The food is always great but when you serve the food is such a shitty way you make the food taste bad. I will drive 8 miles to other location just so I don't have to go here. You let me down freddy!!"}
{"text":"I am not really impressed. The only thing that stood out to me is the burger patties. They have the thin fried webbing around the edges that I used to get from Schoops Old Fashioned Hamburgers in Indiana. .. you know just like you make at home. But the flavor was plain. Fries are mediocre just like the onion rings. And the biggest strike is that they don't have coke products. Boo. This will ALWAYS keep me from coming back. What place doesn't have coke these days? I didn't try any custard. But I don't know if I'll be back to try it..."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE  - cool, calm, fun mix with a lot of different age groups.. it has that \"Grease look\" with the red and white..

CLEANLINESS  - there was a lady that was cleaning and picking up our rubbish. She was also engaging the customers so that was good to see... making sure we were doing well .. asking us how is our food- was anything they could get us...

CUSTOMER SERVICE -was great..friendly and informative...this was my first time so..I asked a lot of questions...after we ordered our meals they asked ua for dessert and we told them when will see after our food... BUT they let us taste the frozen custard and OMG IT WAS BOMB!!! 

FROZEN CUSTARD- this needed a category by itself..it was very very  SMOOTH AND CREAMY...I had the chocolate one with nothing on it...and it was divine...worth getting...

PRICES  we paid abt $36.00 for 2 kids 2 adults and dessert...

FOOD- the French fries were shoe string fries...super thin and semi crispy...lightly peppered...
The sandwich looks messy but it's good. The Patty is a little on the saltier side.. but its tasty. The I ordered the #6 with sauce...  


I rarely give 5 stars so that is why u see 4 stars.  My experience for the first time was a good one.w
Hope urs is one too...."}
{"text":"Great food for a fast food place. Wish they had gluten free buns though. Glad they have veggie burgers."}
{"text":"I am so glad they opened a Freddy's here in town. My mom lives in San Antonio and she raves about how she loves Freddy's patty melt. Unfortunately the last time I visited her, we had so many other places to try and never got to Freddy's. I mean, when faced with the choice of a puffy taco in TX or a burger in TX, the taco will win every time. 

So I brought my family here a few months ago and we all enjoyed our food immensely. As my poetic husband wrote in his review (Ray L.), it was \"fat pants\" worthy. The meat in the burger is not like the other places around here. It just screams \"Hey! someone made me on a real flat top grill and I'm hella good!\". With the yumminess of the burger, the deliciousness of the fries, what else can a girl ask for? Dessert...Oh Yeah!

I get the PBC&B every time. I want to try the brownie sundae but can't get myself to switch. My fam and I always leave this place feeling overstuffed and super satisfied. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh, and prices a right.

I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to take a big bite of heaven disguised as a burger."}
{"text":"Great service. Cheerful staff. Steak burger was good. Hawaiian concrete was So tasty. Large booths."}
{"text":"We waited ten minutes for our food in the drive thru, with no apology, and then came home to open up our food and it was thrown together very sloppily. It just seems like we never get consistently good or decent service here. Disappointing because when we first moved here a couple years ago we loved this place."}
{"text":"I had a Chilli Dog with Frys and a Large Chocolate Shake and it was the best hotdog and milkshake I have ever tasted. The milk shake tasted real."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger and ice cream!!! Vegetarians, u must try the veggie burger (u can customize the toppings to your liking but even the way it comes is tasty)"}
{"text":"Best soft serve ice cream ive ever had!!! Best fast food veggie burger ive ever had as well.  It comes with lettuce, tomatoe, cheese, onions, and fry sauce by default which is nice n simple but if ur feeling adventurous Try the veggie burger with grilled onions, jalepeno cheese sauce, and fry sauce (or whatever condiments you want, they have a LOT to choose from). The fries r good but only fresh so i don't reccomend getting them to go..they will be cold and lifeless by the time u get them home. If ur a vegetarian or just love ice cream go go to freddys, u wont regret it."}
{"text":"Freddie's burgers are solid, love the thin fries, and custards are pretty good too. Freddie's is a nice alternative to Steak & Shake, if you don't want to trek through the south point to wait in line. Service is very fast and they have other menu items if your not in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Takes you back to a time when service was important and quality of food is even more important. Anything from the burgers the hotdogs and the custards are the best. All the employees seem to care a lot about their jobs and what they're doing for their customers. The custards are amazing all the choices you can have."}
{"text":"The service and food gets worse and worse every time we go there! Sat in drive thru for at least 10 minutes and only 1 car was ahead of us... food was cold was we got it  and when I got home and ate my burger the bun was stale  yuck! I think I'll drive out my way to go to the other location. Never had a problem there. 

Was asked to come back and give them another chance and received much better service and food quality! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Typically pretty slow service but the food has always been good and comes hot and exactly as ordered. They are very similar to In-N-Out and almost as good. If there's no In-N-Out near you, you will have no complaints stopping at Freddy's (except maybe the wait). If we're strictly talking fast food this one's better than a sonic, McDonald's, burger King, Wendy's etc without a doubt. Worth a stopping by"}
{"text":"A fun 50's throwback atmosphere and decor, with simple American fare at a very affordable price, interesting thin fries and in house seasoning.Executed well and with a friendly attitude - thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Yeah Freddy's!  This is a nice place for a burger and with the kids!

I have to say this is a nice place to try for Burgers and good place to come back to many times.  To me, it is a definite notch above the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's type of places and near quality of Inn and Out.

1.  Ambiance - 5 star - Nice amount of room, people always cleaning and keeping it up.  Even the toilet is very clean and fresh.  I say one of the best when it comes to overall appearance and ambiance.

2.  Service - 5 star - Everyone here, from the manager to the staff is top notch.  Helpful, friendly, open to giving suggestions and ideas.  I find them all to be very, very pleasant and makes coming here even better.  You know how some of these fast food places, they get what they pay for.  Here at Freddy's top class!

3.  Food - 3.5 star - The food is pretty good overall.

a.  Fries - 4 star - Best thin fries ever.  Great sauce near the cash register just for the fries and of course the huge ketchup dispenser with small paper cups to douse your fries in.  Very crispy, lightly fried taste, and you will want to grab a bunch. They give you a bunch.  Not like Five Guys, yet certainly plenty.

b.  Steak Burger - 3 star.  Actually enjoyable, easy to palm in your hand and eat, compared to some of the ones at Inn and Out or Five Guys where it is so huge that you have to create a logistics plan on how to eat it.  The taste is nice, nothing spectacular in my book, however, tasty overall.

c.  Hot Dogs - 3 star -  Actually I do like the lightly toasted bun they put it in, so that is a plus.  It is a hot dog and we did not get the chili dog or anything. However, I find that the hot dogs at Costco, in those amazing soft delicate buns are freakiin awesome and something like 1.50 with a drink, so compared to that, it is a good hot dog..... just not mind blowing.  

d.  Variations - 4 star - they have plenty of variations, doubles and plenty of your basic condiments. Not over the top and confusing, so that makes it nice for your all around all american burger and dogs.

e.  desserts - 4 star - Oh my, oh my.  you have to leave room for the desserts.  The Turgle, PBC & B, and Chocolate Brownie Delight are great whether as a Sundae or as a Concrete, which is custord mixed in like a shake with all the other ingredients.  Tasty for sure!


I really like this place, professional, tasty , easy to get in, easy to park, easy seating, quality, and nice for family, teens, adults.  Nice!"}
{"text":"I was in the area getting my fill of Freed's Bakery when we decided to stop in and try out this place.
Honestly I was blown away by the service we received upon entering we were greeted by various people. Once getting up to the register we were helped by a guy named Aaron. He provided service with a smile and answered all our questions about the menu, not only did he have tons of patience but he also made sure we got the best deal possible. After we were all rung up he realized we had never tried their custard and brought us some samples of the different flavors. They were all DELICIOUS . My Mother and Daughter loved the vanilla custard and my son and I were big fans of the chocolate. For our meals my Mom got a Patty Melt which I took a bite of and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious their burger patties were. I got myself a Chicago dog to try. It was so good not only was the flavor combo awesome the hot dog bun was cooked to perfection. Both my kids also enjoyed their kids meals which came with tons of fries. I would of gone back to this place just for the service alone but now I plan to come back to enjoy some more yummy food and next time I plan to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Went in last week through drive through, didn't have any issues and the food was great. Decided to come back just for ice cream and a snack just last night and one of the employees  Christina was audibly being rude about us to the other employees while we were standing right there. Not going back if this is how we're going to be treated."}
{"text":"In Vegas on vacation. Decided to give it a try for lunch. I must say we were quite impressed. Inexpensive but great quality hamburgers and fries. Wish we had one on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Didn't care for this place at all.. I gave back my order 2 times and they still messed it up. My fries were ice cold and burger was very chewy kinda gross only kinda good thing here is the milk shakes but I will not be coming back here"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and every time I order a custard turtle Sunday and drive to the parking lot to take the lid off,  it is melted and spills all over my clothes.  I have told the people at the drive thru window many times but they always make it before the burger so it just sits on the counter and melts.  They need a deeper cup so you can take the lid off with out spilling.  When you look through the lid you can see that there is no place for the custard and whip cream to go but in your lap when you remove the lid.  I Will NEVER
go back to Freddie's again.  They just don't care as long as the make a sale."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a lover of a good burger spot. These burgers are good but a little thin on the meat patties. However the frozen custard is delicious. I would go back just for the custard alone.The fries are super thin and I was not a fan. I like thick fries you can actually taste. That was the only downside to our experience.

Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best burger joint besides in n out. It's up there at in n outs level. Their steak burger are on point. Their fries and the seasoning they put on it is amazing! And their turtle custards are delicious!!! Was so excited when they finally opened one up here in Vegas. Wish they had more places in town. But def worth the drive considering we live in north Las Vegas. Def a must try! #goodeats"}
{"text":"Ran through the driveway late night to get some food. Ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a Diet Coke. Nothing to really write home about. The fries were good but I felt the burger was a little dry. I don't know that I would go back again for a burger. Being from Wisconsin I really wish I would've tried their custard so I could've compared it to back home. The next time I'm down in Arizona I will be sure to try the custard."}
{"text":"Freddy's lived up to the hype - bravo!

Loved the inside 50s style diner setup - very nostalgic (can I say that when I wasn't alive in the 50s though? :) )

A car show was going on outside, which was kinda neat.

Being a first timer I listened to the employee's recommendation on the turtle sundae. Just do it guys. Custard rocks, and caramel is da bomb. 

Can't wait to visit your east valley location closer to me!"}
{"text":"I had a incident that the owner personally took care of and my last several visits have been great good food good service Freddy's is a must visit"}
{"text":"Meh. Yelp let me down on this one too...  *eye roll* There was nothing wrong with the burgers; they just weren't that great. The patty has quality meat, but could use some flavor/seasoning. The same goes for their fries. I felt this was a poor imitation of In-N-Out and Shake Shack. I tried it. I didn't care for it. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"It's like In & Out only closer, not as busy, and DESSERTS!
 I love the original, the fries are OMG good, and they have onion rings!
 I haven't even gotten to the dessert menu, which is like a normal person not trying oxygen. I keep eating the #1, and it's so filling I can't do more. I've gone in twice to get dessert and found myself in a daze munching ol' #1 again with a greasy smile and my jeans unbuttoned. (It's just as hot as it sounds.)
 Plenty of parking, haven't used the bathroom, and seriously wondering if I should just drive over and get one real quick before bed."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try Freddies for a couple weeks now, since it opened up 2 blocks from my house. I went there tonight and ordered the cali style steak burger, reg fry and Chicago style hot dog. 
Service was friendly and order was up quick. My issue is I took the food home to eat it, only 2 blocks away, and my hotdog was cold, the burger and the fries were hot. 
Burger tasted ok and same with the fries. I will probably just go to Canes next time."}
{"text":"Tasty fast food.  Good selection - lots of options.  Great, friendly service. 

Management is professional. Place is clean and comfortable. 

They play decent music and it's loud enough to actually hear it (unlike some fast food burger joints). 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Freddy's a dozen times, at least. My mother introduced me and my daughters to it a couple years back.

I invariably get the patty melt and love it.

Their fries are almost matchsticks, and quite tasty!

The concretes are fantastic!

Prices are reasonable for the food you get."}
{"text":"This is a throwback to the 50's simple burger joint. I only came here for dessert and got their turtle custard. The ice cream is super creamy and dense. It came with fudge and walnuts and whipped cream. A perfect little sundae as dessert."}
{"text":"I love the shoestring fries, thin grilled patties, and frozen custard. I also like how I can have bacon on the burgers. You can also replace the drink in the combo for a custard."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I want a good burger and cheese fries. They are always consitant, even when I visit other locations. The burgers are juicy with lots of flavor. The cheese fries are so good! If you have room, try the custard, it is so creamy!"}
{"text":"Myself and my family love this place. Good food, great service! Clean! I love the burgers (YES more then InNOut) The hotdogs are great too. I love the fries with cheese sauce YUM. The custard is smooth and creamy!  5 Stars from us."}
{"text":"Great little burger place that a friend referred us too.  The service was awesome, as the cashier was helpful as we questioned about custard and food.  Also, it was prepared super quick!

The burgers were really good.  I had a patty melt, and it was piping hot and delicious.  Their shoe string fries were really good too, with whatever seasoning they sprinkle on them.  And don't get me started on their custard... er mer gerd.  So good.  And all at a not too bad of a price also!  Two meals with drinks and a small Sunday split between my wife and me ran just under 24 bucks.  Should definitely try at least once!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome, reminds me a bit of In N Out the best in the west but i like the dogs, the buns are killer, some sort of toasted white bread deal, the shoestring taters were kickass as well. didnt try any of the frozen custard but i imagine its great!  i gotta give props to the WWII memorabilia on the wall from freddy's career, especially the Philippines shot on the beach.  it would be nice if one of these were in Cali."}
{"text":"The place was crazy busy and loud but the service was great and the food came out very fast. I give the hamburger two thumbs up. If I had three hands it would get another thumb. It was good food at a good price. They do need to work on keeping the sitting area cleaner."}
{"text":"My husband & I tried Freddy's for the first time & enjoyed it. The burgers, hotdog, & fries were delicious! Especially with the fry sauce. We had family recommend this place to us & we're so glad we tried it & we were not disappointed. We'll definitely continue to go there in the near future."}
{"text":"I love Freddy's and driving to the one on eastern is a pain. Great food helpful staff and this one is MUCH cleaner. They were pretty busy but good was ready by the time I got my drinks and condiments. Now open one close to Nellis Air Force base."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger ive ever had. Fatburger used to be my favorite but now has been replaced by Freddy's! I got the single cheesburger with pickle, tomato and relish and my boyfriend got the double burger just as it comes with mustard, pickle and onion. Both were perfectly cooked in the middle with nice thin cripsy edges on the burgers. The shoe strings fries were also perfectly cooked! We each also got a make your own sundae....mine with vanilla custard, hot fudge, cashews and coconut, absolutely fresh tasting! My boyfriend got one with a large brownie at the bottom, hot fudge and heath bar. He loved that the brownie came in one big fresh chunk at the bottom and we both loved that we got a god amount of toppings for what we paid for. However i did not like that the second cashier was not clear on the extra toppings cost when building your own sundae or shake, he just said \"you can have as many as you want boss\" when we asked how many come with the make your own. Its actually 70 cents per topping :/. (We realized its on the menu after ordering but employees should be clear when asked in my opinion)"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger joint!! Great burgers and service!! I ordered a single patty with cheese and bacon and some fries.  Both were cooked perfectly and very quickly.  I will however order a double patty next time since they are very thin. Their fry sauce is a must!!  Had to order there custard for dessert and I wasn't disappointed there either! Very impressed with the quality of food and service!! I will most definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! Fry sauce is the best thing that happened to me. The bacon double steak burger is my favorite and the concretes are super yummy too."}
{"text":"12-8-17 My favorite burger joint in town. The staff is super friendly and always working hard. 
I'm sorry I didn't catch names to add to my review. 
One of the employees was cleaning and I was impressed with how good of a job she was doing. She was cleaning the child high chairs. She didn't just wipe the seats and move on. She cleaned them top to bottom. Good job!
Your staff rocks!"}
{"text":"The boys and I had Freddy's for and impromptu lunch today.  It was a bit overcast so neither of them wanted to get out of the van which forced me to use the drive thru.  I ABHOR using the drive thru when I am not familiar with the menu and am unsure of what I want to order.  I get completely and utterly flustered and my anxiety goes through the roof.  I hate being THAT person that holds up the line.  Thankfully, there weren't any other cars in line as I tried to navigate the menu and recite my kid's customized order (insert eyeroll here).  The girl on speaker was super nice, patient and upbeat.  She completely hid any disdain or aggravation while she took our order.  She obviously is descendant of Dorothy Mantooth because she was a freakin' saint!  I wish my receipt showed her actual name as I'm fairly certain it is not Term 3.  She truly deserves a proper shout out for her awesome customer service!    

As far as the food goes, we ordered a kid's grilled cheese meal with a Oreo mint concrete (milkshake), a patty melt meal with an unsweet tea and a cup of chili (at Term 3's suggestion since I just wanted to try the chili and the bowl was a much bigger portion).  She could have totally upsold me and I would have never known because I didn't see a cup option listed.  Again, nothing but love for Term 3!  The food was all pretty good, but the fries were the star.  They are shoestring style with a hint of seasoning that gives it a lil' kick.  We didn't get the special fry sauce for it, but we have in the past and it is tasty.  The unsweet tea was pretty solid as well.  Probably my third favorite after Cook Out and Jersey Mike's, respectively.  

The layout of the parking lot, flow of the two lane drive thru and quality speaker system made the visit very pleasant as well.  They completely put Cook Out to shame!  

I do agree that the prices are a tad on the high side for fast food, but you can absolutely tell that these are better meats and ingredients.  All in all, it is one of the better burger places around the area.  Well worth a trip for a quick, quality lunch if you are down by the Mills."}
{"text":"This place is so good for satisfying a burger craving. The meat has always been juicy and vegetables are fresh. The shoestring fries are the best though. The desserts/sundaes are okay, not too remarkable."}
{"text":"I have been to the Freddy's location in Gilbert several times and really enjoyed it so when I saw a Freddy's had opened in my \"hood\" I was excited.  My daughter and I went over for some dessert and they did not dissappoint!  The custard was smooth and creamy with lots of toppings to choose from.  I have not tried the burgers at this location yet but if they are anything like the other location they will be very tasty.  And don't forget to try the shoestring fries.  I usually like thicker fries but these are nice and crispy and delicious!  I'm so glad Freddy's took over this location."}
{"text":"Some pretty tasty burgers right here! I had a steak burger w/cheese. When I 1st looked at it I'm like \"that's kinda on the thin side for the patties\" but I soon realized (I think) that it was because it was pressed down like that when they cooked it. You would think that because it was cooked like that, that it would be dry, but that wasn't the case. As matter of fact there was still enough pink in the middle. I also enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and the little char taste of it. I appreciate how the onions weren't overdone in content like some places, so I didn't have to make a mess picking it off. I also liked the how they used long pickle slices that were not overly sour. I ate the skinny fries on the way home, which is my M.O. when ordering drive-thru and they were perfectly crisp with just the right saltiness. I don't know if I was trippin' or not, but I thought i tasted a hint of garlic in the background? @the drive thru, I saw an advertisement for a drink called the \"pumpkin pie concrete\" but decided to be cheap and passed it up, but by the time I got to the window,  it was more than enough time for me to contemplate and ordered a regular :) good thing I did because it well worth it! It had nice chunks of pie crust and the spice was an excellent compliment. If you're a burger connesiur and have found yourself in a rut, then this is the change of pace that you've been looking for!

Tip: whatever you're about to overspend on steaks n shakes @southpoint save it for Freddy's and while at Freddy's, eat the fries while still warm. 

P.S. thanks to bro. Bong for his recommendation to this place."}
{"text":"Brenda's new location although I've never been inside of the other Freddy's on Silverado Ranch oh the drive thru. This Freddy's was super busy maybe because they're new or maybe because us Henderson folk are tired of In N Out? Tired of In N out yah right. Never that. I've had their custard before but never the burgers or food. Torn between a chili dog and burger I went with the double steak burger with bacon. I added grilled onions which is an extra charge. I've heard of the New Mexico chili burger but didn't see it on the menu. I think it's a diy kind of burger just order it plans and add the chilies and grilled onions. The fiancé ordered a double California style burger. We both got combos and I got a strawberry milkshake with mine. Milkshake came first. Thick and delicious. Very rich in flavor and has strawberries throughout. I like that they serve it with the big boba straws makes it easier to drink. The food came out quite a few minutes later this place was packed and super busy. Overall I'd say the birders are similar to Steak and Shake but these are a little greasier. I know I'm eating a burger and it's not healthy but when my hand is covered in grease I don't really like that. It was pretty tasty but I think I prefer steak and shake or In N out. The fried were very thin and tedious to eat. Felt like forever when I finally finished them. The milkshake was my favorite part and is definitely come back for those but as for burgers I'm an In N Out girl for life. If only they weren't so greasy."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger ever; and the shoestring fries are better than the burgers! Now the custard, we get concretes with our meal everytime it's like a sundae all mixed together. Our favorite is the turtle but with chocolate iced cream...big chunks of pecans and bunches of carmel you need a very fat straw.

A friendly place with great food and great service. It's a winner every time."}
{"text":"I have been to a few freddy's locations and by far this one is my favorite! The service is always professional and courteous and very accommodating. They have messed up a few times on my order but I wasn't even upset because they are always willing to make it right when I bring it to their attention. I truly wish other fast food establishments would take note and learn from this sites operations and practices. Thank you to the crew at the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Always consistent and delicious. Very unique burger. Love the crunch. Normally I don't finish fries but so hard to stop. The special sauce is the best. Service is unique. Seems they have a way to find intelligent workers. Rare at most fast food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their custard is good but their concrete's are a bit disappointing. They hardly put any candy in the concrete so it's kind of like eating plain vanilla ice cream with a few small chocolate pieces in them. They don't compare to Culver's Frozen Custard."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. They are friendly and always smiling. The manager Avery is amazing keeping that homey atmosphere and knows all of the regulars names."}
{"text":"Freddy's is the burgers that I grew up on. Thin, crispy on the edges, ooey-gooey cheesy. The only differences are that they aren't as greasy (that's a good thing!) and the fries are vastly more delicious than the little stand that we used to stop at in IL. Love, love, love the burgers. The custard is very good as well and I have fond memories of treating my dad to a cup of chocolate. It always brought a smile to his face. While I don't often have room after a meal, and cannot seem to resist their seasoned salt on those crisp shoestring fries, I do recommend their specialty concretes, especially the peanut butter cup/waffle cone/ hot fudge/marshmallow they had this past winter. The chicken sandwich is okay and I have not had the hot dogs, but I can wholeheartedly endorse those crispy skinny burgers :-)"}
{"text":"The dining room needs a good cleaning. Greasy hand prints everywhere u look.
Food was fine, the staff were friendly"}
{"text":"went there today 8/21/2016 at 06:18pm. the girl named rachel at the drive thru spoke very fast and mumbled.  i had to ask her what? numerous times.  when we got to the window she got my order wrong and still couldn't understand her. i had to pay for the items she didn't get for me. i asked her to put her name in the recipe for me..she didn't come back to the window some other employee did.  this place needs to train all employees. ..especially at the drive-thru. ..will and have told my family and frienda not to come to this place ...its a nice place but employees need training . i will never go back."}
{"text":"Burgers, Fries, sundaes and ice cream this place has everything that any family needs when you're going out to eat. 

The double cheeseburger is one of the most delicious burgers I've had in a long time and I have sampled everything out there this steakburger is where it's at people you need to order that."}
{"text":"We are long time Freddy's customers and have sent lots of friends here for great burgers, fries and custard. Tonight's visit was a disappointment however. I ordered my single burger California style, and it was pretty much a salad on a bun.  The \"burger\" was quite literally a whisper of meat that was so thin and crisply fried that I couldn't even taste it. It couldn't have been more than 2 ounces of meat. I left hungry after spending $8 on a combo. Not good Freddy!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere, food and don't even get me started on the fry sauce - yum-o!!!!! I ordered a veggie burger which was good but the Freddy sauce really made the difference between a good sandwich and a really good one lol. I want to try the desserts next! Oh, but wait I don't think I can put fry sauce on that LOL!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! 

My review is based on my drive-thru service experience. 

11:00 am, Sunday morning (1/25/2015)  and no one is in the drive-thru. Perfect, I'm the 1st one here thought.... Not! They were packed inside! A parking lof full of customers pulling in to enjoy some goodness... I'm a mom on the run running errands with a toddler in the backseat since 7:00 am.. So  picking up lunch and enjoying it at home is always the best choice for me. 

The drive thru cashier was soo sweet. She never said anything when i added more things to my order as we waited for our food in the drive-thru. I considered ordering a shake and opted out when she took my order at the speaker...Then, as we waited i changed my mind. You only live once right? 

I get home and we dig in.. The best chicken fingers i have had in my life. Not greasy nor stale like other joints. Just simply crispy and hot all the way through the very last one. (This was 15mins after i left the drive-thru). I ordered the large order (6pcs) for about $7. It was well worth it. I would go back just for those. 

Their apple pie shake is to die for. That was gone by the time i was halfway home. Every spoonful had pie crust and filling along with creamy vanilla custard. Your tastebuds would go nuts with this one. 

I'm not a fan of their shoe string fries, those were cold and hard by the time I got home. But my son loved them. He gave them a 5/5 as he dipped them in ketchup.

The single burger was delicious. Like the ones dad used to make on the grill growing up. Delicious and well-done. 

Thumbs up for Freddy's, they are doing burgers right over there."}
{"text":"Hands down best steak burger and the custard is to die for. Amazing food, fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"When I was sitting in Freddy's enjoying my burger, I heard some criticism from nearby tables.  I think the overarching criticism of Freddy's - the thin, almost crunchy burgers - merely indicates that people seemed confused about what a steakburger IS.  A steakburger is MEANT to be thin and crunchy.  That's the whole point.  I guess people in this region just don't \"get it\" yet.  If you want your burger thick and juicy, you're at the wrong place.  In that case, I recommend Badger Cafe on Tropicana.  

However, if you're like me and just LOVE a steakburger, you've come to the right place.  I'm originally from the Midwest and went to college down the street from a Steak 'N Shake, the king of the steakburger (disclaimer: the Steak 'N Shake in Southpoint is NOT representative of what a Midwest steakburger is...they don't seem to know how to do it right).  I was SHOCKED to find that Freddy's does the steakburger BETTER than Steak 'N Shake!  The meat is flavorful, the cheese is very melty (sorta like In 'N Out), and the bun is light and buttery.  The fry sauce goes well on both the burgers and the fries.  Speaking of fries... I think the fries are the most notable difference between Freddy's and Steak 'N Shake.  Both chains are known for their shoestring fries.  However, Freddy's fries are fried to golden perfection and seasoned with this incredible seasoning salt blend.  SNS is known for undercooked, underseasoned, cold fries that I only find palatable if drenched in piping-hot cheese sauce.  

I haven't tried the custard.  I don't eat custard, but I'm curious.  I might make my fiancé order it next time so I can live vicariously through him.

Five stars for exactly what it is - a delicious, high-quality STEAKBURGER.  It isn't fair to rate it any other way.  If it isn't your cup of tea... fine!  Great!  More for me!"}
{"text":"Great burger for a quick stop. Fries are good too but eat them fresh as they do not stay crispy long in the bag."}
{"text":"I have already Yelped Freddys as being one of my favorite Burger Places. Freddys is much better than In And Out. I am writing today to show appreciation to one of the Managers, her name is Heaven. She went beyond excellent customer service helping us with a Birthday cake for our 2 year old girl. Thank you"}
{"text":"Terrible drive through service. Saw a customer ahead of me give there credit card to pay, then when I get up there and pay with a credit card she asked for my ID.  Who gets carded buying a burger!!"}
{"text":"Great custard, the vanilla is nice the chocolate can be a bit rich but delicious. They are dog friendly when you go through the drive through and provide a complimentary pup cup if you ask for one."}
{"text":"Freddy's is a great new addition to Las Vegas.  The food is good and the prices are reasonable.  The frozen custard is great too!!  Portions are pretty big so you could probably share.  The burgers are thin and come with everything.

The only thing is that they are seem to be a bit more greasy than other places. They just opened so they still have a few kinks to get out with the service but overall it's a nice change from bigger fastfood chains."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through on a Tuesday evening around 8:30. When I pulled in to order, I couldn't see any other cars so I assumed it would be quick. I ordered a dirt cup sundae (custard, gummy worms, Oreos). As I pulled around there were two cars in front of me. It took FOREVER like at least 10mins for me to get my custard and leave. Slowest drive through I think I've ever sat in. It slightly redeemed itself with the delicious custard. I will definitely go back for ice cream, but maybe go inside next time."}
{"text":"I had only tried this place once before on the way back home from California and boy was i pleased. Great burgers and a change of pace from the regular burger franchise. Delicious burgers, awesome chili fries and mouthwatering custard. Love the simplicity if the food, less is definitely more here! Drove all the way from the east side of town to get it."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the burgers. This is a personal preference but I like them thick and juicy. Freddy's makes them thin and crispy... like a meat chip. Not my thing. Second, I have to lament the cheese they use or rather: what they're using as a cheese substitute. The goop they used for the chili cheese fries looks and tastes like it came from a spray can. Yuck! What ever happened to the real thing?
Didn't try the hot dogs or custard, but I'm not sure I'll be back for those."}
{"text":"First time we have had Freddy's!

Not sure what the hype is all about truthfully...the burger was good, but I think I prefer In N Out myself!

What WAS good though....the Vienna all beef hot dog on a butter toasted bun + fries! Sitting on a delicious Raising-Canes-like butter toast...The bread was so good and the hotdog full of flavor, that I didn't even put condiments on it! It's good enough completely plain jane!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/freddys-frozen-custard-and-steakburgers-las-vegas?select=bC8jpNtxPAf_pUtBXxEQxw

We didn't get to try the custard, since I wanted to go to Nielsen's right down the street! Glad I did...it was excellent!

Good food here, just don't drive 45min like I did and expect anything better than InO :("}
{"text":"Great burgers. Not the normal fast food burger. The fries are small cut and sometimes are over done."}
{"text":"Excellent desserts and fries with good service

I had never seen a Freddy's until moving to Phoenix.  Turns out that it's a nice add to the list of faster food options.

While the burgers are good, they are indeed thin.  Compared to the big wad of food some places give you, it may even seem skimpy.  But, it's a welcomed change for those trying to not stuff themselves.

That said, our family is a fan of Freddy's dessert concretes/sundaes, chicken tenders, and fries .  Excellent on all, especially the PBC&C and Turtle concretes.

A bit pricier that your MickeyD or B-King, but we like it better.  They at least commit to not pre-cooking everything.  And the service is usually much nicer."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times to get burgers and drinks for lunch, and it's been good each time. Nothing amazing, but pretty good food for the price it just doesn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Went to Freddy's on Baseline in Gilbert today to try their brand new cheese curds. To our disappointment they were out of them. But one of their managers, Solomon, was so apologetic and kind that he made it right with us. I want to report great customer service here folks!!!!"}
{"text":"First off we were 5 guys fans. Good food but overpriced. Freddys is fantastic. The burgers are very flavorful. Also they do have shoestring fries which are good but wish they were a tad bigger. You get a pile of fries an they are great but they are small. The Fry Sauce is fantastic. It even tastes great on the burgers.  The customer service is great. They come around to all the tables an check on you, take your trash and make sure you dont need anything.  My wifes had the Patty melt and Ive had several different burgers and all have been very good.  
Now on to the Dessert. I have had several of the sundaes. All were very good. I am not a huge fan of the concrete as all the flavors are mixed together an find it hard to have the satisfaction of tasting different flavors separate. But it is very tasty nonetheless.  This is a great place to eat.  The food is always hot an very good. The custard is fresh and tasty. Customer service is great. I would definitely tell you to stop by and try some food. Its Good!  The prices are normal for this type of fast food. Comparable to In n Out but less than 5 guys."}
{"text":"I come to this location often and I normally don't have many issues, but tonight I went before they closed and the customer service was terrible and my order was wrong when I got home. I also had to remind them to put the cheese sauce I ordered in my bag before I left. I got home and to my surprise my order was wrong because they were to busy wanting to close up and go home to get my order right. I understand how it feels for a customer to come at the last minute when you're ready to go home, but that doesn't mean you just don't do your job the way it's supposed to be done. The girl in the drive through had an attitude and clearly didn't want to waste her last few minutes at work helping a customer that was the first thing that made my experience not so great, and then to have to correct them on one part of my order only to get home and see my order was made wrong made this experience pretty terrible. I still love the food at Freddy's and I normally have great costumer service when I go, but clearly you can't go right before they close or you'll be treated as though your business isn't wanted or needed. I'm very disappointed and very irritated. Should have given one star for this experience, but I normally don't have this terrible of an experience when I go there so I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Well, I must say the flavor is there but the flavor is ketchup, mustard, onion and pickle. Without them, there would BE no flavor!  The meat is so thin that there are holes you can see through...like lace.  Onion rings were okay but I've definitely had better.  Combine with the wait, I'm thinking it's not a place I'll return to."}
{"text":"Better than average burger.  I had the green chile cheeseburger combo.  I did like the crispiness to the burger.  The were a bit on the greasy side, but had good taste.  The fries are so small but have good flavor.  Not the best fast food burger but definitely ahead of most of them."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick bite after trolling around Springs Preserve. Shoestring fries are a favorite in our house. It was fairly busy for mid-afternoon on a cold, rainy Saturday. But the patriarch of our family was pumped to come here because it says Turtle Sundae on the side of their building in giant red letters... LOL. 

T Money and I grabbed a booth while he ordered for us- I passed this round, but T wanted a hot dog sans bun and plain with fries and a small lemonade. Typical. But it's kind of convenient for me because he orders the same thing almost everywhere we go so I get to view the quality of the same dish at various establishments. J ordered the sundae, as mentioned, and a Chicago dog combo.

The hot dogs looked great. They're actually pretty big and cooked just right. Not weird a wrinkly, not too skinny, and they were so nice to my husband when he mentioned that Tristan had food allergies and that's why he couldn't have a bun. One woman took it upon herself to ensure that his order was done right from start to finish. I really can't tell you how much I appreciate that. I know it's kind of a pain for an establishment, but when people understand (or even if they don't) and just take the time to make sure it's all good, we are incredibly grateful. I ended up sneaking some of the fries because, well, they looked awesome. And they were as delicious as they looked. I can't speak personally about the turtle sundae, but my husband killed it. I think I got one quick glimpse of it and then it was gone. Always a good sign in our house.

Even though we don't live too close, we do go to Springs Preserve (as afore mentioned) so I know we'll be back when we get another snack attack."}
{"text":"Okay, it takes a lot for me to give a place five stars. Especially something considered somewhat of a fast food restaurant. Walk in place was clean, immediately greeted, staff was extremely friendly and helpful, food was actually Damn Delicious. I will be coming back. Pretty impressive, I hope it's consistent."}
{"text":"This location needs some work with their so called CUSTARD.. i never had a custard where it took only a couple of minutes for it to melt..eating the same custard from the Eastern/Silverado Ranch Location it defintely is a big difference. This experience was still great as their food is still awesome but the custard was a big dissapointment it was not thick creamy and it melted real fast. i couldve spent $1 at mcdonalds and got a better quality ice cream. So much for my perspective on reviewing fast food chains for now it is necessary. Please get your custard back on track Freddys Thanks. (i hope i get a reply from the manager saying it was real custard because if it really is they need to check the difference from their other location)"}
{"text":"I gotta say this place was delicious. From Burgers to Hot Dogs and Chilli Fries and their Custard!! Was So good. The Sirloin Steak they used for their burgers gives them a unique taste and theres a nice crust from the grill so it gives the burger their distinct taste. Shoestring fries were different like super skinny mcdonalds fries. So i will be back to eat here for sure and i put this burger up there with In n Out. Still In n out has a slight edge with grilled bun"}
{"text":"Even though this eatery has been at this location for a number of years I for unknown reasons never tried it, today was the day. Ordered the number 4 combo, burger, hot dog and fries. The burger was excellent, the beef really tastes like beef unlike other joints. Hot dog was great, like the toasted bread they use with that. Very friendly staff, clean and inviting, we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a new burger place in Henderson by the Sunset station. Its fast friendly and rather tasty. I like their fries. Staff is courteous and good with recommendations if you are new to the burger. Custard was okay. not as good as luv it frozen custard but for a quick on the go refreshment it was fine. They have malts which I enjoy staw/banana my favorite. Five guys around the corner is better in my opinion for about same price. This has a drive through so bonus there i suppose. Can say I will go again. I had the burger and the hot dog combo. Filling and well put together. If you are in the area try it you may find a new burger joint to defer you from the standard fast food fair."}
{"text":"The WORST!  Terrible food, terrible service. We do not even understand how they are in business.  The staff should be trained or fired."}
{"text":"My husband, sister and I LOVE this place! The burgers are delicious and I am pretty much addicted to the fry sauce! The customer service is always amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Chicken strips, better than expected. 

I was expecting the food to be horrid, like In n Out, but it was actually good.

Nothing special about the Freddy Sauce. This isn't the 1950s, your sauce ain't that special."}
{"text":"By far best burger in Henderson. I use to pass this place a lot until one day my boyfriend and I decided to stop by.
I'd recommend the California burger. It has two meat paties with island sauce and everything else. The fries are a bit thin but I liked it. 
They have fry sauce on the side for free (no limit) yaaaasss
The peanut butter shake was good just wish they came with whip cream. They also give you a big straw to make it easier to drink.
Overall way better than inn n out."}
{"text":"Had dinner there a week ago.   The restaurant was fairly busy and tables were not clean.   I asked to have our table wiped off and the girl came out with a rag that looked like it had been marinated in mustard and ketshup.  I mentioned to the girl that the rag wasn't clean but thought it was funny.    I didn't."}
{"text":"Good food fair prices friendly service.
The drive through line moved quickly. I could see people including families inside the restaraunt enjoying time together. I was happy for something cool on such a hot day"}
{"text":"This is not my first time trying Freddy's. I first tried Freddy's in Wichita, KS and the food was amazing. I recently found this location and I am still in love with the food, service and customer service. Today a few Soldiers and I decided to have Freddy's for lunch. Graciously a Korean War veteran purchased our lunch for us. As a service member myself I'm so grateful. Later during our meal another Marine Corp veteran paid us for our service and our meals. The Freddy's clientele is always amazing and never lacks the welcoming feeling. I'll be back for my Oreo cookie sundae!"}
{"text":"Had these burgers when I was out in Omaha. And was wishing we had a Freddy's in California. This is the next best thing. I love the burgers because they are crunchy on outside and moist on the inside.  It never disappoints. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really sad to say that I was underwhelmed by this Freddy's location.
After going to the Victorville, CA location...and then finding out that this one is owned by the same person, I had really high expectations, that were not met.

The good:
The staff is SUPER polite, and very helpful:  welcoming us when we walked in, wishing us a good day when we left, etc. 
The fries were FRESH, and hot, and delicious.  

The not so great: 
Comparing to our visit last weekend to the Victorville location, the burgers were REALLY underseasoned.  They weren't bad, but it was definitely noticeable.  

They messed up my fella's order...a lot.
He ordered the original double steakburger, adding ketchup, lettuce, and tomato. 

He got a single steakburger, California style, including thousand island...and he hates mayo based sauces.  
He wasn't thrilled with it initially, noticing that it was a lot smaller than it should have been, but about halfway through the burger, noticed the thousand island, pulled the burger apart and saw why it was so small...

Now, we didn't send it back...mostly because he was already halfway through it, but he was super disappointed.  

I'll attribute this to maybe being an off day, and would still gladly go back...but I don't know that I'd drive out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Freddys is still one of my top  favorites here in Henderson if i have to have fast food. The service is always five star and the burgers remind me of my dads bbq burgers  ."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the Freddy's in Springfield for years and the taste carries over to the new location. Still has the \"new place\" crowd which I assume will slow down after a while, but we were lucky to even get a table.  The burgers are among my favorite of any chain, and better than Culvers in my opinion. Steak n shake is better on price but not burger. It has been a while since I have had the custard, they advertise a kids t-shirt that you buy to get free custard with the kid combo but i couldnt see anywhere how much the shirt costs."}
{"text":"Get double the bacon and pour that fry sauce on top of that burger. You'll die happy."}
{"text":"OK, I LOVE Freddy's. I go there a lot with my family. I always order #6. Get everything on it! They make their own patties too, you can tell they're handmade. I don't like though how a lot of the times its dirty inside and teenagers/kids are being so loud, and no one tells them to please be more quiet -- because Freddy's does seem like the teen hang out place - I noticed that when I was a teenager. Anyway, I love their food and desserts. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Ok this is my first time here and.....I could go back :) I compare the burger to In and out sort of on the small side for me.  That's why I don't eat at In and out a lot. You do get that fresh taste that In and out is known for from here.  

I did get the number 7 the double.  It comes standard with mustard, pickles, bacon, and onion.  The bun is soft and in fact I could see your fingers going through it if you held onto this burger long enough.  I did not have that problem, it was gone within minutes.

The meat is different in that it is thin and lean, yet mine had a crust on the ends from the grilling.  You either are going to like it or hate it.  I could do without, but I am sure it is the grease and fat from the meat that makes stuff taste better :)   I can say this must be a Freddy's burger thing. 

I wanted chili cheese fries, but they were out of chili? WT freak?  Oh well I settled for the .50 up charge on my meal for the cheese fries.  Not really as satisfying as chili, but it will sort of cure my craving for over indulgent fries.  

So far a good experience, it is really close to my house so it is just another option for me between all the fast food, not good for my diet selections.  In fact after eating all that I am going to the gym."}
{"text":"Alqays love having their custard and burger, me and my family always end the night off good with a dinner treat here. Food always comes at a good pace and never keeps us waiting!"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law told me that Freddy's Oreo ice cream Sandwich was amazing so I had to try it.  She was right!  

Please note that I later tried it pre-made and it wasn't nearly as good.  It was hard as a rock.  Moving forward, I'll only ask for it to be freshly made.

Freddy's custard is awesome.  It's as close to real gelato that I've tried in AZ.  This rating is ONLY for the custard and not the food."}
{"text":"Look elsewhere for frozen custard. The vanilla tasted like McDonalds & the chocolate tasted like Wendy's frosty. Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have to say about Freddy's has been said in other reviews here, so I'll make it quick and just hit the high points.

First, this place is pretty much a copy of Steak & Shake. The burgers are the thin patty \"smashed\" style burgers and the fries are thin and crispy matchstick style fries. Both the burgers and fries are very tasty IMO.

When you get sick of the large chain fast food burgers, Freddy's makes a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"This place has always been consistent and friendly. I do have minor issues sometimes with my order like ordering a large meal but was charged/given a medium meal. It's fine, and I know it could've been a miscommunication between us. But overall, this place has good food, and has a friendly staff. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not great either.  For the prices I paid I was expecting a better burger and a better Chicago dog (they get 3 stars for cleanliness and friendly service).  I haven't had the frozen custard, but there is no need when Nielsen's is just a couple blocks down the street.  Smashburger's burgers and fries are better than Freddy's, and they have a better menu selection (chicken as well as vegetarian options).  If you want the 50's diner feel with better food I would recommend Steak & Shake at the South Point Hotel."}
{"text":"Freddy's has finally opened!!! The place was very busy and as soon as you walk I'm you see a plethora of Freddy's workers  in the kitchen. The atmosphere reminded me of an In-N-Out with a mix of Five Guys service and a Steak N' Steak diner feel. Anyways, my boyfriend and I shared the #6 combo- double cheeseburger California style combo with the Chicago style hot dog. The burger had a piece of hair on my bf's hamburger patty! The meat tasted plain and dry. The fries were shoe string fries but had too much salt!!! The Chicago style hot dog was wrapped in a butter toasted bread with an all beef frank, peppers, onions, and some celery salt. The hot dog was overpriced for a small piece of meat, same size as your typical grocery store hot dog. If you take a bite of the hot dog itself, it is very salty...Overall, while the concept they were trying to create was cool, the food itself needs to work out some major kinks. Try this place out and you might get a different experience then we did!"}
{"text":"Clean, excellent service, good food at reasonable prices. Plenty of room. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was craving ice cream and Freddy's came up on my Yelp! b/c it was close to my location. Super fast drive-thru and my ice cream was amazing!! I got cookies-n-cream blizzard type thing and there was plenty of cookie in it and the ice cream was refreshing. Will return!"}
{"text":"My new go to spot when I want a burger. Their burgers are better and less greasy than Five Guys, but they have a better selection and their prices are better as well. The burgers have a nice flavor and I love the thinner crisper fries. 

Service is great as well. The person working the drive through was helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"The so-called steakburger is really a joke. Steaks are usually thick, the flat patty is so thin that I was able to see thru some parts. Fool me once, never again. The fries were so thin and hard that was it was hard to swallow."}
{"text":"This is our fast food burger of choice. I really appreciate the friendly staff with their positive artificers and smiling faces. There shakes, sundaes, and cones are fabulous as well.  In-N-Out who?"}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Surprise just opposite from Fry's.  It cannot be missed as there aren't really any nearby or adjoining businesses.  
Parking is plentiful and there's even a drive through if that's your desire.  
The restaurant is clean and well lit including their bathrooms as well.  Interesting thing, if and when you go into their bathroom, there's these miniature monitors attached to the faucets that flash these advertisements which I found to be really cool as I've never seen that before.


Menu - Their menu is large and it will take you a couple minutes to figure out what you want to eat so you'd better step aside for the other patrons, at least, that's what we did.  Menu is clear and above the cashier and staff are very helpful in answering any questions you may have.    

Service - The staff was very friendly!  There's staff at the order counter, staff at the pick-up counter, and staff that walk around and even clear up your table for you.  All of them were very helpful and friendly.

Food - I ordered the number 1 which was a double hamburger patty hamburger with all the fixings which came with their signature shoestring fries and I substituted my drink for a large vanilla milkshake.
The hamburger was mouthwatering and done just right.  The condiments and all the toppings tasted fresh.  The patty was thin yet still juicy and tasty.  The burger wasn't greasy or sloppy with everything falling out.  The buns was soft as if they just came out of the oven.
The shoestring fries was hot, crunchy and tasty.  I think I could could've ate 2-3 portions as it didn't feel as if it was filling.  It was that light!
The vanilla shake was a definite pleaser!  It tasted as if it was made with real ice-cream, it was very cream and rich, and cold!  I ordered it for myself but the wifesky drank most of it and kept apologizing!

Rating - 5/5.  Definitely will be worth coming back for their frozen custard which I'm kicking myself for for not trying but it's an excuse to come back isn't it!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is one of my go to place for burgers. The steak burgers and shoestring fries are great! The concrete mixers are really good to! The employees are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went here last week or late the week prior. The food was as good as ever.  My wife tried their green chili burger and it was out of this world. The best in Phoenix! 

In fact it was so good that I went there again last night with plans of ordering it. Unfortunately the promotion ended the day before and the burger was no more. I must say I was disappointed and ordered something else. 

What I got was delicious but it just wasn't what I'd set my sights on. I must implore Freddy's to bring that green chili burger back or at the very least allow someone to order the toppings ala carte.  

With that out of the way, the food is fantastic and the prices are well below what I'd expect.  You can't go wrong coming here for a meal."}
{"text":"I'm a bit bewildered that Freddy's isn't more well liked.  It's on the \"other\" end of town for me so I only get there where I have reason to shop at Arrowhead, which isn't often because to me that is one of the worst malls in America.  It's been so long that I guess Freddy's moved across the street, or at least the two of us seem to recall that it was in another building last time.  What I like about Freddy's is that the entire staff seems happy and friendly, unlike the more famous burger chains where you can hardly get a grudging \" ya want fries with that\" out of them.  I also like the fact that you can get things (like especially frozen custard) that 98% of the other places don't have, and if they don't show it on the menu, no problem, they'll make it for you anyway.  And, of course, I like the burgers. While they look paper thin they taste better than most fast food chains and that's what really counts.  I don't care for places that put so much crap on a burger that there's zero taste of meat left.

What I don't care for at Freddy's are the prices.  We had the smallest cheeseburger, one order of fries and two large drinks and it cost over $20.  Freddy's needs to do a reality check on their pricing structure.

So why isn't it well liked?  I asked a friend who complained that the burgers were greasy and thin and that the fries were so skinny they got cold fast.  Huh?  To me the quality and taste of the meat is more important than how thick the burger is (and besides, the burgers at Freddy's are bigger around than those at most places ... it's still the same amount of meat).  Greasy?  It's fried meat, how do you make fried meat not greasy?  And for the fries, there seems to be a misconception that any fast food ever in history served their fries hot.  If so, I've never been there. By the time fries are served they are always at room temperature. PS - I like Freddy's fries!

The day I was there was on a weekend and we were almost the only people there. I think the only other person was there for a takeout.  If I were Freddy's management I would be concerned.  Granted, their location sucks but there have to be other reasons people dislike the place. The basic concept is good, I hope they do something to improve their popularity before it's too late. (4-stars because of price)"}
{"text":"First time here and I was really impressed. I got the double steakburger California style and it was fantastic. The seasoning was perfect, it was cheesy and the beef was tender. The shoestring fries were crispy and tasty. The chicken tenders had a crispy and peppery crust and were moist.  My wife loved the frozen custard which is basically ice cream. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place.  The steak burger is like beef jerky on a bun.  They are supposed to be competition for In-N-Out but I don't think they are on the same playing field.  Tried a hot dog on another visit and was surprised on how expensive they are.  Especially for a dog that I can get elsewhere for less and tastes better."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Orders are always served correctly. Get phased on the patty melt."}
{"text":"Wow! I was not expecting to like this place as much as I did! I got the grilled chicken sandwich, and it was very good! The fries are great, too, especially with their special sauce. The frozen custard is the real deal. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"went to freddy's in victorville,  ca i had the classic double cheese combo the shoestring style fries are great the buger was not pink cooked perfect and the custsrd sunday was wonderfull im a fan will try the vegas store when i get home 4 stars."}
{"text":"For a chain burger joint, Freddy's is up there with the best of them. 

I typically get a Double California burger with fries and a drink. I like the California since it has veggies on it -- nothing \"weird\" like avocado or anything, just lettuce, tomato, onion... and pickle, I think. I don't know how Freddy's escaped the \"California\" = \"Avocado\" thing, but there you go. 

The burgers are VERY thin and the beef comes out almost crispy (I would say like a \"beef chip,\" but that conjures up something too close to \"cow chip,\" which is something else entirely). Anyway, that's why I get the double -- I do the same thing at In-N-Out burger since I feel it provides a better meat+cheese to veggie to bun ratio. 

The fries are shoestring-style and usually hot and crispy, which is nice. Don't forget to go get some of their fry sauce for dipping. 

The custard is good, too.

I haven't ventured too far away from the burgers, fries and custard, but I have been to Freddy's several times. The staff at all of the locations I've visited has been consistently friendly and helpful. 

Note that this location does not have Sweet Tea... you get to make your own with a pile of sugar packets."}
{"text":"thought in and out was the best.  freddys proved me wrong.  my new fave hamburger place.  the burgers are so tasty with the sirloin they use and the fries are thin and crispy.   plus their menu is a little more versatile for picky eaters."}
{"text":"I believe this particular place is a relatively new establishment at this location. After walking into the restaurant, we were greeted and directed to the ordering counter. The decor looked very much like a modern version of a 50s diner. The place was very clean with plenty of staff on standby if help was needed. 

Since this was the first time eating here we ordered the Freddy's steakburger and hot dog combo to share even though it is known for the Freddy's original double with cheese. We asked them to split the order for two people and they gladly obliged. We ordered onion rings, a Dirt n' Worms sundae, a Hawaiian Delight sundae, and a PBC & B sundae (pictures attached). 

The Freddy's steakburger was alright. I wouldn't rave about it but still good. There was a lot of mustard with some onions and pickles and not much else to the burger. The hot dog was actually very good. The hot dogs were served on buttered, New England style rolls. The onion rings were good. The batter and onion stayed together unlike many other places where the onion just slides out after biting into it. The shoe-string fries are very good with the Cajun seasoning. The dirt n' worms sundae (oreo cookies, gummi worms, whipped cream, and cherry) was alright but I was told the Hawaiian delight sundae (pineapple, strawberry, coconut, macadamia nuts, whipped cream, and cherry) was much more flavorful and fruitier if you like that kind of thing. 

All in all, I would say it's a 3.5 star rated place but give it 4 due to the friendly nature of the help always asking if we need help or if they can take our trash away."}
{"text":"1st impression \"IMPRESSED\" 

Upon our entry the place was packed! But we still gotta a good seat. Loved the setup it was clean and bright. 
It took a minute to place our order but the menu was simple and the prices weren't bad.

we finally decided, I got a double burger plain with cheese (of course) and the wife did also but hers had everything on it, the kids shared a cheese burger and a hot dog.

THE BURGER- it was ok... tasted like a real burger (not frozen or a patty) I'd give it 3/5 stars.

FRIES- deep sigh... unfortunately I didn't like the fries at all, they were too small I'd have to eat a hand full get a good fry taste.

OVERALL this was a good experience, good food, good prices and a nice clean eating area and the bathroom door opening system was genius!"}
{"text":"Freddy's has become one of my favorite fast food places in town. I find myself craving their steakburgers on a constant basis. Their fries are consistently good as well. That brings us to the custard which you can have straight, in a shake or in a sundae. It's a lot of pressure when you get up to the counter and have to choose one. You can't go wrong with the peanut butter, banana chocolate shake though. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"So I finally got to eat here after the rest of my entire family ate there.

Food was solid
All said it tasted good and fresh
I went with 2 Chicago's a d 1 plain
Wife went with Party Melt on Rye
Son had the #6 combo no complaints
Fries were 1/4 of standard cut, good for forking light for finger foods

I overall Great drive thru"}
{"text":"great food the burgers are super thin but still so good and the fries are good and the ice cream is the best part they should send out coupons or get in groupon tho maybe bc it ends up being like the same price you would pay at an actual sit down restaurant but other than that chad is the best employee and deserves a raise"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I tried it for the first time yesterday because my husband wanted something quick but different.  It's bright, roomy, and there's plenty of seating inside, and there's a drive through if you want to grab and run.  The service was fast and friendly.  The employees wouldn't even let us throw away our own trash! lol  The burgers were fresh and delicious.  I may like this place better than five guys for quick burgers!  The fries are shoestring and very tasty.  Especially with some of their seasoning.  The custard is smooth, creamy, and delicious.  And the prices are so reasonable.  I think of getting a frozen treat at a place like cold stone and, although it's like comparing apples and oranges, I enjoy custard SO much more and it's usually so much cheaper!  We'll definitely return and so glad we finally tried."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I agree with the sentiment that Freddy's is better than In-N-Out. It is good and I really enjoy their custard sundaes but price wise and taste (regarding burgers) In-N-Out has won me over.

The burger can be a bit on the dry side so I add extra stuff to it. Staff is really friendly which is always a plus. Love that they serve Vienna beef hot dogs here.

One thing I definitely recommend is their custard sundaes. The Hawaiian delight is topped with shredded coconut, strawberries, pineapple, and nuts. The creaminess of the frozen custard by itself is worth trying.

So if you want to have a little more variety than just burgers give Freddy's a shot."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here, passed by several times. It's an OK place, Average burger really.  What sets them apart is the thin grilled burger, but not to my liking.  They do appear to have a lot of interesting ice cream dishes.

This place is a head above Smash Burger which is real greasy.  So maybe give this joint a try if you like thin grilled burgers."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 2 hamburgers in Phoenix.  The patties are thin but wow what a taste the very essence of a drive thru burger joint.  Fries are also excellent.  Closet one to Scottsdale is about 20 miles but well worth the trip.  I get cravings for their double bacon cheeseburger.  Yuuuummmmyyy."}
{"text":"The food was good so was the service everyone very friendly but I didnt think there was a wow factor. Its way better than a burger king or a Mcdonalds. 

1. I tried one of there New mexico hatch chilli burger that was good and spicey (seasonal burger)

2. tried there regular burger they only put mustard on it, wish they put ketchup but you can do that yourself. 

3. the fries are shoe string but thinner, didnt care for then that much.

4. The frozen custard was good, didnt notice any difference from nielsons down the street.

Overall good but not great tasting, I will go again and try the California style burger next time."}
{"text":"Thank you for the wonderful guest relations department here!!! My peanut butter fudge crunch that I'd been longing for for 8 months was AMAZING!!!!! Not only did Freddy's take care of my past visit fail they exceeded my expectations! 
The hot food was great as well! Grilled chicken sandwich super yummy! 
Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. 

Part 1: 
I came here when it first opened & was excited to try a new place to eat. Upon entering on one of their \"Grand Opening\" days I was pretty impressed with the atmosphere.  However, the service there was not impressive. ---I'm not impressed :T 
I came up to the register ordered a patty melt & a hot dog.
  So, when i went to pay my order and made a comment on how there was a lot of workers/trainees; the girl that was helping me gave me a snide response back (whoa! ok lady calm down.)

When we received our orders and tasted it: the patty melt was just plain and gross. A The hot dog was okay, but i'd rather go to costco & i would get a bigger hotdog for a cheaper price. The quality of the food and for the price we paid at Freddys, wasnt a place we wanted to go back to. However, we did go back since our friends told us to  go try their steakburger & not some patty melt. 

Part 2: 
I suppose the service was better this time around, but the food was sighs, ewww. We ordered the steakburger and the significant other said, \"it tastes like a mcdonalds burger\" LOL. oh geez, i guess he wasnt impressed, either.  The steakburger didn't taste like anything and all i can taste was the bun.  

Sorry, Freddy's but you lost this time."}
{"text":"Freddy's Custard is fantastic. For fast food, it's very good at fair price. At every store I've been to there is always some confusion on timing the custard and the meal... but it always seems to work out.  They serve Pepsi, that's the only down side."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge \"fast food\" type person but I am liking this place. I've never been to a Freedy's, I'm glad I tried it because I will be back.
My only gripe was my cashier, first she said I couldn't get just a California Steakburger, I had to get a meal, when I said I only wanted a small fry and small side she said she'd get in trouble if she rung it up wrong, then said she'd ring it up as a kid's meal. I was so confused, I was worried I was not going to get my order, so I skipped adding an ice cream because I didn't want to complicate things.
I got my food, the burger is super thin, even thinner than In-n-Out but it was tasty and the cheese slice is way smaller than the burger or bun but they make it work. I may get a double next time. The fries are great too. Fresh and crisp, not greasy, love the season salt option they leave out to add and the fry sauce is a wonderful surprise.
I ended up going back up for ice cream or as they call it frozen custard. I got a Mini Turtle Sundae. It was super good, tons of toppings, the custard was smooth and creamy. I was a happy camper.
I will be back, I think my husband will dig it here too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Double Steak Burger California Style without the buns because I'm on a low carb diet.  It was good to know that they can accommodate you on that front.  So  my burger was kind like the protein burger from In and Out.  The only problem was, the patties were under seasoned.  I think this may have been the first time ever I had to salt my burger.  The patties were smashed so they're flat kinda like smash burgers' patties.  I was a bit disappointed about how, the only difference between my burger and whatever it is my husband ordered was that, mine had tomatoes.  I wish they could have made it more exciting like perhaps adding avocados to go with the title, \"California Style\".

I have yet to try the frozen custard.  I hope its worth coming back for."}
{"text":"The burgers are...good; they are definitely fresh. The chili dog is my favorite thing to order from them. I can do without the fries. I feel that I am eating the bottom of the bag chips. These little chips they call fries are not what I call fries at all. The custard is good but not enough of a selection. Not my first choice when thinking of a burger spot."}
{"text":"Took the family here for a quick lunch in between the wait of the DMV. Restaurant was clean, food came out pretty quick and customer service was great. We ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches. Everything was fresh and hot. Shoestring fries were my favorite. They give you a pretty good portion of them. The special sauce was a little too mustard tasting for me, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Awesome burgers and patty melts! The frozen yogurt with pumpkin pie is so amazing! Omg! Eat here you'll love it"}
{"text":"If steak and shake is a 3 or 4, this is a 5. The custard is super solid too. Just happened upon this place, but it would kick the shit outta every place in my home town. Love Freddy's. Outstanding burgers and custard.  If ya love a greasy burger, this is the place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant so much. The fry sauce is so addictive. A client of mine recommended it and I thank her every time I talk to her. The flat burgers are a delightful twist. The shakes are fantastic and the skinny fried with the sauce are off the charts. 

You should absolutely go try this fun burger joint a try. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Had the patty melt but should have just had a burger on a bun....and the hot dogs looked fantastic (will try next time for sure). The patty melt was good. The taste to me is similar to 5 guys. The fries were way skinny...not sure if made fresh or frozen... they were ok just not great. Now the custard !! That's a winner !!! I had a mini hot fudge sundae and I believe it came to 3.39 and it was quite enough for me. It was a good size and DELICIOUS ! The staff is very courteous and friendly and I think that is missing in many establishments. Very clean as well. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Late evening Saturday and this place is packed.  We look over the menu, place our order and found an open booth.  There are several large groups with sporting uniforms, the place is a buzz with noisy chatter.

They finally call our number and the burgers arrive.  The bun is fresh, butter roasted on the flat top, the burger moist and has great flavor, they call them steak burgers and they are cooked when ordered.   The skinny french fries are golden brown and crispy.  Overall, a good burger meal.  

Once finished, we decided on the custard.  I got a chocolate brownie delight.  The brownie was a bit hard and at the bottom of the cup.  The custard, whip cream and nuts on top made it difficult to get a bite of brownie, but I managed."}
{"text":"My first time here it was About 1:15pm drive thru had a very nice girl working it. I ordered the patty melt fries sweet tea a Hawaiian delight and cheese curds all the food was yummy  
The only dis appointment I had was it wasn't double the meat like it shows and says on the menu, another thing is the French fries are like a French style green bean lol very slim and small but taste good....but I will go back  I choose them over five guys any day  ty Freddy"}
{"text":"Delightful frozen yoghurt at at unbeatable price - a mini sundae for three bucks and plenty for two to share. I can't rave the same about the unfriendly service though...my cashier  had  crabby pants and  had the look of a snapper turtle. Oh well...Life goes on!

Their French fries looked fantastic and YES, OUI, SI - I will be back for those...and maybe a burger also..."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Burger's a little wimpy, so I'd get 2 patties next time. Turtle sundae is to die for!!"}
{"text":"The kids wanted to try out this location so we stopped in on a Friday night. The drive thru was wrapped around the building and it was just as busy inside. The line inside moved quickly as the newly trained employees were well trained and efficient. This was our first visit to this location, but we've been to the Eastern location multiple times.

The steakburgers are cooked to order on a flat top and are normally served with mustard, pickle, and onion which are the perfect accompaniments for me. The burger patties are less than a quarter pound with a nice crust. Onion rings and chili cheese fries are suitable options if you don't want just the skinny fries. The catch for me is the custard which you can have them hold your order until you're ready. They have the rich and creamy custard in chocolate and vanilla with options for concretes and sundaes.

I haven't tried any of their dogs or their Italian beef sandwich but I'll be sure to do so on future visits."}
{"text":"This place was tight! 

We came for only one thing \"Custard\" but what everyone else was eating around us smelled GREAT. 

Service was fast, fast, fast!  Restaurant was spotless! Even for late night there were plenty of staff available.  

Custard was fantastic.  Only request I have is when creating the flavored custard (i.e.: Hawaiian) start by adding flavoring on the bottom of the cup.  As it is now, by placing all the flavoring on the top there is no \"Hawaiian\" flavoring once your half way through ... Its just  custard ... but it's still GREAT custard!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The hotdogs are so juicy and flavorful, the french fries are seasoned just right - you cannot go wrong with anything you order here! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This Freddy's is top notch and my favorite! I usually go through the drive-thru but I've eaten inside a few times and it's very clean. Great customer service from all the employees! Food is definitely on the higher end of fast food restaurants. I've tried their burgers, chicken sandwiches and Chicago-style hot dogs - all are tasty. Fries are shoe-string and they have their own fry sauce. Save room for dessert! Freddy's is also known for their frozen custard desserts (sundaes, shakes, malts and concretes... LOTS to choose from!)"}
{"text":"THE BEST steak burger you'll ever have! If you are ever in concord, NC please do stop in if not for the burger try any of the desserts. Perfect for a hot day. I have the strawberry funnel cake and I was taken down by it !! Just amazing. The burger down to the pickles was phenomenal will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place the burgers with fry sauce are so good. I had a turtle sundae omg the custard is so good. The customer service is great also.  I highly recommend them for a great burger and dessert."}
{"text":"Went today on my weekly burger fix and I have to say this place rocks.  The steak burger was amazing I had a double California style with 1000 island and cheese.  Very yummy burger and then they have these shoestring fries to go with it AMAZING.  I recommend getting the honey mustard to dip them in.  I didn't try the frozen custard as I was full from lunch but I will be back for that.  

Freddy's you have earned yourself a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Updated 5/24

Manager contacted me after our bad experience in the drive thru and advised that they have expanded the lanes and that issue is resolved. And have worked on some customer service issues. So we went back to give the food a try this time - only got kids meal and custard las time. We ordered double bacon combo meal, steak burger combo and chicken tenders. Got custard for dessert. 

The burgers just aren't for us. They were way over cooked and very crispy. Not juicy at all. They have patties like steak and shake or smashburger but even more thin and dry.  Will not be getting hamburgers again.  The fries are ok. Very salty and thin shoestring type. 

The kids really liked the tenders so that will be the go to for the kids. Wife and I will stick to the custard only.  It's dense and good but they left off some fruit on one of the sundaes."}
{"text":"Regular burger house. The pluses are real butterscotch sundaes and shoe string French fries."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe this experience, but Not great. I'm certainly not gonna go out of my way to return. I ordered a steak burger and a chili cheese dog. The burger..meh..ehh, it's quite greasy...I mean drippy greasy....wrangling the lettuce and bun greasy. If it's your thang it's salty... too salty for my taste.

The Chili Dog however is where the trauma comes in. It certainly was not worth the $4.49 in portion to cost. The taste was confusing...buttery and bland. Now, I know where I'm eating...it's a chain and mostly located in the suburbs. I never thought a hotdog could be tough though, know I've experienced that. The big kicker is I just don't think the Chili that they were stingy with should also smell like Canned Dog Food.

I guess the only positive thing is that it could be judged as the pricey kind of Canned Dog Food. You know the kind that over privileged pet children get, or the brand you get pressured into purchasing by an annoying pet person.

Freddy's as a company you need to take this back to the focus groups. I mean come on...Canned Dog Food is the scent that slipped through or much scarier got approved. It also left it's scent on my hand finger filanges.

Freddy..Freddy..Freddy, at least strive to be the best mediocre you can be and do something about that Chili it's scary."}
{"text":"This place is pretty meh for the price. The steak-burger patties are VERY thin. I do not have a huge appetite and I could easily eat a triple-burger. Shoestring fries are OK if that's your thing. I prefer a little more sustenance. Frozen custard, same thing. Good for what it is, but too rich for my taste buds."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with the food here. I got the Chicago style hot dog combo and I honestly thought the hot dog would be bigger. It was just a regular sized hot dog... it tasted like store bought hot dog. The fries were ok... they were the skinny fries.

My boyfriend had the steak burger and he liked it, he also like their fries.

We went through the drive-thru and there was a long line but I think it's because they just opened a few weeks ago.

I don't know if I'll be returning but if I do I'll try one of their burgers instead."}
{"text":"Love our Pattie melts and the custard deserts were the yummiest!! Love the clean and quiet atmosphere and friendly service! Wished I could join the Kids Club just to get a T-shirt!"}
{"text":"The the place. Great burgers, hotdogs, custard, fries, etc...always really friendly and very clean restaurant.  I recommend for lunch anytime."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this chain before l tried it.  We happened upon it and noted that this place  looked very much like a Steak n' Shake.  And so it is like an upgraded Steak n' Shake.  

It's expensive, for fast food.  You will need to decide if it's worth it to you.  For me its a bit indulgent for fast food fare, but in fairness you can taste the quality.  I noticed the difference with the first whiff.  It was solidified with the initial bite.  

The shakes are creamy.  They are generous with the toppings and made with real ice cream, and rich whipped cream on top.  Their burgers taste of higher quality meat, seasonings and fresh buns.   Oh and the fries...  Just try them, and you can thank me later.  

I will update my review to include some photos at some point.   We made the food disappear so quickly I didn't get a chance to capture the moment."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. I'd come back if I was hungry and this was very nearby. I wouldn't make a trip out of my way nor would I pass up any number of other choices.

The place inside looks like a rip-off of In-n-Out crossed with a typical 50s diner. Clean top to bottom. Very attentive, very friendly staff. Table service is a nice perk.

I had the original double with cheese as a meal. Shoestring French fries? Hmmm. Not impressed. They were hot but also most of them were quite overdone and hard as rocks. The \"steak\" burger had evident quality and decent flavor. But, I doubt it's possible to make a patty any thinner than they do. Was it even an 1/8th of an inch thick? I doubt it. It didn't seem like there was much meat at all. The cost was $7.60 before tax. 

I think, maybe, since they are pushing their custard, that they look to Culver's as their main competitor. I'd rank the two on par with one another. The quality of the beef is better than a lot of other fast food burger choices. The price is a bit on the high end for the quantity. 

So, it's not that I would not come back but I can't find a reason that says I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, so I decided to come here and try a burger.  I had been to Freddy's a few times prior (dessert only) and was never that impressed.  I decided to go with the combo #7 which was a Bacon and Cheese Double Steakburger.  The combo came with fries and a drink.  Total was around $9.00.  Here is how it was............

Bacon and Cheese Double Steakburger-  Pretty solid.  They flatten out their patties on the grill so that it gives a nice char/crust to the burgers.  The flavor of the meat was delicious.  The patties were a tad too thin though.  It almost looked like a burger pancake.  Not sure how many ounces each burger is, but it seemed a bit skimp for a double burger.  The toppings were very fresh (bacon, onions, pickle slices etc) and the cheese was melted perfectly.  Taste was great, but value was just average. Kind of reminded me of a Wendy's Double Stack, but less \"beefy\".   Might want to go with a triple burger if you are hungry.

Fries-  They use super duper thin cut shoestring french fries.  They were just alright.  They were freshly fried at least (oil glistening off of some of them) and had good flavor.  It seems like you are getting more for your money, but they are so thin, I think you actually get less than what is perceived.  

Drink-  Pepsi products..meh.  I had some Mountain Dew.

Service was great!  The cashier was incredibly friendly and the guy who handed my food was chipper, too.  While I was leaving, they thanked me for coming in and wished me a good rest of my day.  The decor and layout of the place is pretty cool too.  I'm just not sure if I will be a regular customer.  A tad pricey for what you get, plus I am not a fan of their frozen custard at all (Culvers frozen custard is WAY better IMO).  I'm sure at some point I'll give their food another try.  It was good enough to satisfy, but not good enough to rush back.  We shall see."}
{"text":"So...I had been to a couple of different Freddy's throughout the Phoenix area, but had never been to this one.  This one is the closest one to my house, and I decided to come here for lunch.  I saw an advertisement for a green chile burger, and also that they had fried pickles as a side.  Sign me up!  Drove down to the drive thru and placed my order of a green chile burger combo with fried pickles as my side and a Mountain Dew to drink.  Here is how everything was...........

Green Chile Burger-  Freddy's uses the \"smush\" technique for their burgers.  They squash them down really flat with the spatula so the edges get nice and crispy and hang over the edge of the bun.  My burger came with two 2oz patties, some nice grilled onions, some mustard, cheese and a fair amount of green chiles.  The taste was very good.  The cheese was melted perfectly, the onions and green chiles were nice and pliable/soft and the patties tasted fine.  Maybe not the best green chile burger I have ever had, but for a fast food type place, it was pretty solid.

Fried Pickles-  These things were great!  They were little pickle chips, breaded and deep fried.  They had a great crunchy batter on them and were delicious!  I would definitely get them again!

Service in the drive thru was great!  The lady who took my order was extremely chipper and happy, and the guy that handed me my food was all smiles and thanked me for coming in (it was sincere, too...I can spot a bullshit reaction from miles away).  It was a good change of pace compared to other burger type spots, and I'm sure I will be back at some point in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and even better custard! Everyone is always so friendly and eager to help. Jazz was someone who has helped us multiple times while eating there. He's very sweet and alway ready to help us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast-food restaurant to sit down and enjoy a meal. The atmosphere is a little more upscale than a McDonalds or Burger King and the staff have always been friendly. The prices aren't the most reasonable, but the food is pretty good and the frozen custards are delicious."}
{"text":"Freddy's is definitely in the same league as In 'N Out and Five Guys.  This is a compliment as I love those places.  The bad news is that I'd rather have either of those, and they are both within a few blocks of Freddy's.  If you want frozen custard, then it's probably worth it (however I didn't try it - but I'm sure it's good based on the amount of people ordering it).  Personally, if I was really craving shoe-string fries, I'd go to Freddy's.  While it's not my favorite fast food burger, the steak burger is also very good and you will like it."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday afternoon because we had went to the Chandler Mall to look around. They had pretty decent burgers.... a little small but you could tell they were made there not rrozen, and the fries were really skinny and kinda crispy served with yummy freddy's fry sauce. prices were a bit higher than I would pay but not outrageous.... was going to have dessert cuz they have an amazing menu but didn't have room"}
{"text":"Faster service if you go in. They have fry sauce. I used to always have fry sauce when I lived in Utah . It's nice to have again. The steak burgers are good the custard is even better!"}
{"text":"YUM! My favorite place to go for a burger! Reminds me of steak and shake back in the mid-west. The onion rings are wonderful too. they also have the shoe string fries like steak and shake. Their custard is ok, but honestly, culvers has them beat there. Overall, great burger spot. No complaints."}
{"text":"D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S I obviously have a lot of time on my hands lol. I remember one of my friends was passionately telling me how awesome this place is, and how it's better than in n out. I couldn't believe had to try it for my own. 

Well I think this places is a little better than in n out. Possibly because they have a menu with more options than the standard burger. Every single time I've ate here it's been excellent. The burgers freshly made, and the fries still nice and warm. I love how they don't add seasoning to fries, and you could add to your taste. To top it off, Freddy's dipping sauce hmmmm goes so well with the burger and fries. Oh and can't forget they have custards too and they are a must try."}
{"text":"For a busy place they are top of there game. Food was just so so for me. The burger has this crust around it that kinda hurts the gums and roof of your mouth when you bite into. Pretty sure it was the cheese the melts over. Get by the crusty part and the burger does taste fresh. If you like skinny shoestring crunchy fries then you will love these. For me not so much it was like eating warmed up potato sticks from a can. I did see managers and maybe a owner going around asking what they thought they never did come by our table prob since most of the fries and 1/3 of the burger was sitting there untouched. If it was the owner he was sitting outside playing with his cell phone more then asking people what they thought and it was lunch time. Personally I'll stick with Five Guys. Little more expensive but you get what you pay for with Five Guys!!!!"}
{"text":"In need of awesome custard-style ice cream? Come here! Quaint 50s diner vibe and good service. Could wish for more custard flavors, even adding a Strawberry would be nice. But boy are they generous on the toppings!! You can order (when inside) & they hold your custard order until you are done eating your burger or Patty Melt or hot dog. How brilliant! No rushing to finish your food to get to your ice cream. I had the Hawaiian one and it was yummy!! My boyfriend had the chocolate one w brownies and MAN I wanted that too!!
Only drawback is seemingly a trend w places (started by In and Out I guess) of having SUPER THIN patties for the burgers forcing you to get a Double unless you barely wanted MEAT on the burger you order. The meat is supposedly ground steak but who can tell when it's thickness can be stated as the height of two stacked pennies? Taste was alright, it was a very charred piece of meat. My boyfriend's Patty Melt looked better. Fries are shoe string and you get A LOT; they even have Fry Sauce(hint: it's not exactly ketchup). 
They also have a freezer with ready to go treats like ice cream sandwiches made w Nutter Butters$1.99 right inside the door. 
Sorry no pics this time."}
{"text":"Goof enough hot dog and interesting burger. The hot dog consist of pickels, chiili, and onion. The burger meat itself is not a patty but rather ground meat fused together. The fries are thin but better tasting than most fast food. Well if you had to chose between fast food and this...pick Freddy's."}
{"text":"Great food and helpful staff, only gripe was the tables all needed a little bit of wiping down."}
{"text":"A great burger place. This Freddy's was recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I went. I got a number 1 combo with cheese and extra patty (I highly recommend the extra patty since they are quite small). Also, my friend got one of their desserts, which is served to you after you finish your main meal. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. The desserts are incredible as well. Taylor was a pleasure to deal with"}
{"text":"The menu in drive thru really needs to be updated. I've never been here and the menu was confusing, and it doesn't help that the drive-through person isn't helpful and rushes me through."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a long time since I had not been in the area. I am sooo glad that I remembered to eat here while I was in Phoenix. Best burgers I have had in a very long time. I really like the fresh thin patties as opposed to the super monster patties made out of question mark meat that gets served at so many fast food joints these days. I like simple, old fashioned tastes and this place is right on point with their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"That was the best burger I've had!! The cheese was perfectly melted topped with golden grilled onions.

My fries were hot and crispy!

The drive thru service was quick and friendly! 

My order was filled accurately. 

And they left a note on my receipt \"have a beautiful day\" 
--------

Returned yesterday, and another phenomenal burger and excellent service! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Freddy's has a delicious Patty Melt, and their shoestring fries are crispy and flavorful when dipped in a mix of their fry sauce and a packet of Chululu hot sauce.  Atmosphere is fast food clean."}
{"text":"The very first time I went to Freddy's everything was so good between the crispy fries and I had the grilled chicken breast with grilled onions. And they have the best concrete brownie ice cream, so good! Can't beat the sweet & salty!

So with that being said, I was very satisfied with my first visit to Freddys. So I went with my family the second time and again order the grilled chicken breast sandwich. And two bites into my sandwich the chicken is a little rubbery, so I go to the front & no problems asked they make me a new one. The sandwich is much better just as delicious like the first time I went.

A couple days ago my grandma & dad had a birthday so we all went out, and Freddys was our first choice. Repeatedly I got the chicken sandwich, and a couple bites in I could tell it was rubbery and just had a over cooked taste. So one of the workers could tell I was upset and came over to see how everything was doing, she was very apologetic and did ask me if I wanted a new one, but by then i was done. 

It's sad to say but I won't be back"}
{"text":"Delicious! We make sure to stop here when we visit from San Diego."}
{"text":"Got the Chicago style hotdog & fries. Was very good. Will def return to get more when I'm missing Chicago hotdogs."}
{"text":"Freddys is Awesome!  We love the food!  There is just something addicting about this food (ask for green chile on your burgers for an extra treat).  BUT the absolute best thing about this place is the customer service.  I have never been there that the service wasn't exceptional.  Happy staff, you just don't see that very often.  Spoke to one of the owners last night (Curtis) what a great guy. Also Asha, the gal at the register who helped us pick out some new items to try (yummy - chili cheese fries), so warm and friendly. Great job Curtis and Asha. Thanks to you two (and other great staff there as well) We will keep coming back and recommending this place to all we know!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing I live there food  and how u can order it to be cut in half and they will do it . They also let u try the custard to see if u like it . They have delicious fries and the manger is always nice I noticed that he goes by every table when u dine in to make sure your food is good and to ask if everything was to your liking . They never disappoint me . This place is now my favorite burger place"}
{"text":"Decent place with decent food. Won't be returning. 

Me and the boyfriend came here on a whim one night with our puppy in tow. The menu board states something about them not beginning to cook the order until you order because it's worth the wait. They truly weren't exaggerating. 

They have steak burgers, chicken sandwiches, chicken fingers, fries, shakes, etc. The menu is pretty simple and easy to order from. 

At the window, the girl offered us a \"pup cup\" which is basically a small scoop of custard. Our puppy enjoyed his impromptu treat. It really helped to pass the time because we waited so long. 

Upon getting the food, it wasn't bad but wasn't great either. If you want a meal plus a shake, it's about $15 which isn't bad but with so many other competitors on the same street, it's not worth it. At competitors, we can get the same exact meal for around $8-9. The burgers are of a smaller size, which isn't a problem for me but had the boyfriend furious. He got some type of double patty and was highly disappointed... we had to stop at a dollar menu spot for another burger for him on the way home. Also, the regular size shakes are kind of small in comparison to every other fast food joint that sells shakes. They have onion rings too that are a little smaller in circumference compared to standard rings. For the $0.50 upcharge I was expecting the bag to be stuffed with onion rings but they were good nonetheless. 

To me, this is the type of place where I'm glad I tried it but will probably never return."}
{"text":"Average Burgers and Fries, The Custard is Delicious and I always have to get the Passion Fruit Tea my favorite."}
{"text":"We love this place each of the 4 times we have visited!  It is a classic burger and shake place with no disappointment so far. The food is cooked to order hot and fresh. The seating is limited."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for the first time yesterday and had some good and bad experiences. To start, the custard and double cheeseburgers were delicious! Everything tasted fresh and was well worth the price. 

I also ordered a chicken burger but unfortunately the chicken patty was raw... The outside seemed to be seared but the inside was probably only 20% cooked. Not sure if I'd ever order a chicken item again."}
{"text":"Las Vegas locals you need to try out this burger joint. I have so many recommendations for other burger fast food restaurants but Freddy's stands out in its own way. I ordered the #1 which is the Freddy's double burger and the double patty melt. We also ordered two large fries on the side with no drink. 

I was really addicted to their really thin cut fries with their fry sauce ! The burgers i would give a 3/5 its delicious but they need to have a better bun for it. The patty melt i would give a 3/5 as well because its something that i tasted before. All in all this place is huge and clean, drive thru service was fast and friendly. I will definitely come back when I'm not feeling my other favorite burger joints."}
{"text":"This 2.5 had been *generously* rounded up to a 3, but no longer....

I went to Culver's, basically.

Now I get what Freddy's is trying to be.  Although Freddy's has a mythology that  lays claim to being the originator of the burger style, Culver's just does it better.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/culvers-phoenix#hrid:yDsMVl72kItXdkeWUKHLog

They do everything better.  From friendly customer service, cleanliness, to the fresh and tasty food; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate Greasy~Crispy Spectrum.

The basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping, so they aren't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras.  Very cool, Culver's!   Boo Freddy's for being so lackluster with customer service, overseasoned with food, and generally failing."}
{"text":"Wow x2!  My steakburger was out of this world! The fries with there fry sauce and there seasoning was awesome.  But the cherry on top was my turtle  dessert"}
{"text":"You want a great burger, this is the place. It slams In and Out and all the other competition. This place is as good as good can be. Their french fries are shoestring and very flavorful. They have fry sauce. Knock out. Chili, out of this world. Homerun!!! Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"I am revising my reviews of this place. Went back again tonight and was really amazed. The burger was good, the sides and the service was outstanding. I mean a burger place where people greet you and come around and ask if they can get you anything. Then, we finished eating and they were right there ready to clean up our mess. They had a minimum 2 people doing nothing but cleaning up in the dining room. It was impressive. McDonalds, BK, Wendy's take a lesson in customer service from these people. They do everything but park your car for you. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. Today was Veterans day. The cashier asked if I was a Veteran. Said yes, she shook my hand and thanked me for my service. Then she handed me a certificate for a complete free meal on my next visit. WOW....What a place.
Great job Freddy's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I know, I know, this is fast food... what do you expect? Answer - at least as good as McDonalds (which this really wasn't... eek!). I went with a class from work, and I will say, the employees were awesome... friendly, patient, and helpful. Additionally, they were having a fundraiser for brain tumor research, which is great. The food, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It reminded me why fast food isn't a good thing. I had a cheeseburger with grilled onions and the thing was a salt bomb.... from the first bite all I could taste was the salt. I should've gotten a hot dog... props for using Vienna Beef! I tried a fry and it was chewy and sad, especially for a shoestring, which is usually awesome. Probably wouldn't come back here, sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure it's illegal, but I couldn't purchase my food because this store has a policy not to accept cash bills larger than $20"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! If you live here and haven't come by for a great steak burger or a concrete then you are missing out. As much as I love the food here the staff is by far the best group of people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. The place is kept spotless. The green chili burger is Sooo good (real hatch green chili)!!! They even have military Monday's. Again, if you are looking for a quick meal for the family that won't break the bank make Freddy's a list topper."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! and would place it as one of the places I would visit if I was in the area. The steak burgers are a little thin, but pack big flavor. The fries are nice as well. 

The custard is outstanding and is a must after dinner meal.

Service wise, the staff is extremely friendly and compariable to chik filets...

If your in the area I would definitely make give this place a try."}
{"text":"Was excited try this new burger place! We went at lunch and it was packed. Since there are a couple of dining choices in this plaza, parking can be tight. We walked in and every booth and table was taken. This is what you want to see when a new restaurant opens!

The guy who waited on me was really enthusiastic and helpful. I expressed I had never been here before and he gave me a low down of the offerings and of course highly recommended I try the custard. I reviewed the menu and since they have a special sauce aka Thousand Island, I chose to have my steak burger San Francisco style (pickles, special sauce, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato). I made it a combo with their skinny fries and a drink. I wanted to save room to try their custard. It took a little while to receive our meals. They call you by number but a couple of gals were walking around cleaning tables and offered to bring me my food which was nice since there were so many people waiting. I don't think they took into consideration the amount of people that might want to take their food to go. They could have created a larger waiting area in the restaurant design. 

My burger arrived, luke warm....lost a star. Flavor was ok(not In and Out quality), nice big pickles and the fries were not bad. Not really anything to rave about except the good service. Not enough time to try out the custard since the line was so long so another time for that. I know this is only there first week so I will wait a couple months before I try them again to see if they have improved on providing a steaming hot burger."}
{"text":"They need to change the name to Freddy's Frozen Custard, Steakburgers, and Chili Cheese Fries! LOL - seriously the Chili Cheese Fries were the bomb! My son and I went with the double w/ bacon combo (upgraded the fries) and it came with a refillable beverage for about $8 each. Great portion size, quality, and service for a great price! It gets better, they also have a drive thru! My kinda place!"}
{"text":"I went to the chain before when I was in Oklahoma. When they came to North Carolina my husband and I was like okay that's what Im talking about. The come up lol. We went for like a week straight because we love their food on our cheats days. I wish they was closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious burgers!!!

Freddy's is my ideal burger spot. The patties are hand molded at the restaurant and they're super juicy and full of flavor. Beyond satisfying! 

The shoestring fries are perfect! Freddy's seasons their fries and very yummily, in fact. Get the fry sauce! Perfect combo, forreal.

I could eat Freddy's anytime of the day, no lie."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Big smiles with air brains....the window clerk screwed up an order ahead of us because she failed to read the slip three times in a row. The California Burger was like a cow pie sort of style, with an onion thicker then the meat slab.  The burgers were cold because the tomatoe and onion were so large, over powering the meat slab.  It was like a cold picnic including hard, cold, French fries.  I should have figured when the order was handed to me and the bag was not hot.  I am disappointed to see yet another business that will be short lived.  Sadly, I have already noticed the swing of business slowing :(."}
{"text":"Stopped at Freddy's off of 521 for a Late Lunch/early Dinner and to get our kid some Frozen Custard.  It was my first visit to the chain and I had no idea what to expect other than my wife telling me she got Frozen Custard there and it was good.  

The inside feels like an nicer Checker's - not quite a sit down place, but not quite a fast food chain.  The number of workers there was shocking - 4 people behind the registers, 3 people at the drive through window, 2 people at the food-pickup location, and random people in the cooking area.  We counted over a dozen - I couldn't believe it.  

The first thing I noticed after seeing the hoard of employees was the place was not very clean - it wasn't dirty, but for being pretty new, it should have been spotless.  The floors had trash on them from people dropping food and wrappers, and they must not use the right cleaner as the floors felt slippery, though no grime was on top of them.  

I ordered a steak burger with fries, and my wife got a hot dog.  The food came out in a few minutes.  The burger was like a good Steak'N Shake burger - much more flavor though and the beef tasted fresh.  The amount of fries was a little pathetic and they weren't very tasty.  

The custard is awesome, creamy, tasty, cheap.  It was a highlight for sure - they run a special every week.  This week was $0.50 cones - and they blow QT's away!  The week before was Custard in a collectible Baseball hat, the next week is sundaes and the week after are a blizzard like creation.  It's a nice addition to keep things fresh since the only flavors are Vanilla and Chocolate.  

The food and location are good, though not amazing.  The layout is nice, but cleaning and routine upkeep needs to be addressed - with a workforce like that it should be as clean as Chic-fil-A.  Not a bad visit - but definitely room for improvement.  We will visit again and I hope I can create a positive update."}
{"text":"I pre-ordered an ice cream cake for my son's eighth birthday and all of the folks there that help to put it together were extremely helpful and his cake was ready by the time his party happened. I am really happy with the way that the ice cream cake tasted and the service there was awesome! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"This Freddy's is great. The manager there (tall gentleman, he told me his name but I can't remember it unfortunately) is really friendly and courteous. Always asks me how I am and if there is anything else I need from him. I appreciate the friendly atmosphere. It's all about attitude, and this team here has a great attitude. I feel comfortable eating here and always have a great meal. The fry sauce is the bomb dot com. I love it! 5/5"}
{"text":"I was cruising down Williams Field the other night and Freddy's just kinda jumped out at me - had never noticed it there before, apparently because it just recently opened.  Brak loves a good burger, and being hungry at the time, I had to pull in and check it out.  I ordered some sort of double burger and fries.  It wasn't bad, but I wasn't terribly impressed either.  The burger patties were thin with some weird consistency that I can't even describe.  They were somewhat overcooked.  The bun & fixins were fine, and that helped somewhat.  The fries were super-thin and coated with some sort of thin coating of batter before frying, and while they were tasty enough, their thinness made them somewhat of a pain to dip in Heinz's finest and made for having to grab a bunch of them at a time to mow through them without taking forever.  I'll probably give Freddy's another go at some point, and maybe try something else on the menu.  This joint requires further study for a comprehensive conclusion.  Brak will be back!"}
{"text":"They have cheese curds!!!   Food is always good maybe a little more money than McDonald's but you don't feel like garbage after eating here!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our burger and fries.  The Freddy's seasoning is great and we plan on ordering it for the house!  Staff was nice, attentive, and they kept the place clean."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru tonight and was super bummed to find that my order was wrong when I got home. I've never had a problem with Freddy's before (and we've been going here since it opened) so I was disappointed :( The burger I got was still good though! Just wish I got what I had ordered."}
{"text":"This restaurant has friendly and helpful staff. The freshly made food items are unique and delicious. Every time I come, I notice something different to order  and am pleased with the variety of menu options. Very clean and attention paid to detail."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! The staff is always super friendly and the food is prepared fresh. I love the fry sauce that they offer and it even goes great on the burger after you finish all of the fries."}
{"text":"The girl in the drive-thru was an angel. The custard sandwiches were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Perfect for those who miss the fifties aesthetic. I didn't order anything since I'm on a diet but this place was right up my patient's alley. They have a lot of options so there should be something for Just about everyone in the group. My one tip is to maybe ask if there are any vegetarian options or dairy free, I didn't and I have my doubts about whether they do. That or don't bring that person you know who doesn't eat meat.
As for the service. I've definitely had better service, I would like to blame it on our coming in two hours before closing, but not really though. There were plenty of other guests in the diner and drive thru, and I didn't really didn't feel welcome in their cafe. 
As for the food, if you're looking for an alternative to in n out, I recommend giving them a shot; they aren't better, but they are comparable."}
{"text":"First visit. Was across the street at savers and saw the new place. Ordered myself a patty melt and onion rings, drink and custard. Patty melt came with fries.  Patty melt was greasy and fries were small and cold. Ice cream was okay. Didn't try the burgers I'll have to try that next time. So I can write a review about the burger. Other people eating the burger next to me looked like the burger patties are McDonald's hamburger size."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!  Good crispy fries.  Nom nom nom.  The custard was equally delicious.  Be sure to save room."}
{"text":"Were in the area and decided to try some local places. Went through the drive-thru for some dessert. My husband got a shake and I got a concrete. My husband was disappointed his chocolate cherry shake only had cherries on top and not actually blended into the shake. Although my chocolate chip cookie dough concrete was good, the price and size was not worth it. We would probably go again if we were in the area, but it would be for a special treat because it is a bit expensive for the small portion sizes."}
{"text":"Best Shakes in Town, sorry Steak N Shake Freddy's has you beat!"}
{"text":"A classic 50's style burger place. The steak burger and shoestring fries were good but the ice cream was the best part of the meal. Unique sundae options and fast service. They offer to-go ice cream cakes and frozen custard. One of the best vanilla custards I've ever tried! This was my first time at a Freddy's... I can't say I'd go back just for the burgers but I will definitely return for the desserts!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. My girls are up their kids meals no problem, which is good. One had a grilled cheese and the other a hot dog. I had the hot dog meal and noticed it was the exact same size as the kids meal one. (Note to future me to get a kids meal for me too next time since the only difference is drink size which doesn't matter because I don't drink pop.) my husband got the double Steakburgers California style. It was \"okay\" to me when I tried it but is oozed grease. My husband kept saying it's a hamburger (but I don't expect THAT much grease.) we also tried 2 sundaes, the peanut butter cup and banana and the dirt and worms. They were good, thank goodness each was shared between 2 people because we forgot just how thick custard is. We came around a 1pm on a Saturday and the place was decently busy, but not so busy we could not find seats. That shows the popularity of the place. We will probably be back because of the ice cream (always a great motivator to get kids to eat.)"}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with this place.  Tonight I ate the invitation-only training run preparing for the official opening tomorrow.  This place was packed.  Considering the inexperience of this new staff everything was acceptable.  You'd never know this staff and restaurant was brand new.   The line was very very long.  It wrapped around the inside dining room.  The cashiers moved people through as quickly as possible.  Some of the slowness was due to the customers not being familiar with the menu and having trouble what to order.  My food came out correctly.  I got the #4 combo consisting of a single patty burger and a hot dog with fries and a drink.  I also got a chocolate custard.  Every item was great.  The thincut fries were wonderful.  Even my son(Mr. Picky) enjoyed his meal(double patty pattymelt)  I look very forward to returning to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Great service and food. I can't have their seasoning and I still enjoyed their burger. I can't say that about any restaurants burger. My friend enjoyed their hotdog served on Texas toast. She was so happy she ordered food to take home to her family. I hope they get one open in my area soon."}
{"text":"Update - I never heard back from the Corporate Office which shocks me because of what it appears the co-founder Freddy stands for.  I read his plaques in his restaurants and it appears he is a man of integrity with morals and values however that is not what the Corporate Office represents when dealing with customers.  I spoke with Mike and he stated that the Corporate Office doesn't return phone calls even if the customer requests a call - they only refer the call onto the franchisee.  Lance at the Corporate Office stated that he didn't see a case started from my call so what Mike stated is supposed to happen apparently didn't or I would have already been in their system.  In addition, I have left two messages for Elaine at the Freddy's Corporate Office and have never heard back from her.
I did hear from Katherine (a district manager who was filling in for Carolyn) the same day that I complained to the store manager and she stated that she would look into the situation and call me back and of course she didn't call back.  Mike had her call me today after I alerted him that I never heard back from her.  When I asked if her phone number is the number I should call in the future when the safety hazard occurs she laughed and chuckled and of course I called her on the carpet for that and told her there is NOTHING funny about this situation !!  She back peddled and it took her about 4 minutes of conversation to admit she didn't call me back and when she realized I wasn't giving in to inferior customer service she finally apologized for not following through with what she said she was going to do.
I called Mike back to share my phone conversation with Katherine and he called me a liar and said that Katherine (or Kat as he calls her) would not have laughed.  I told him that I was appalled that he would accuse me of lying and he could have cared less.  It appears the reason for the lack of respect and inferior customer service at the restaurant level comes from the Corporate Office down - which is EXTREMELY sad because I like the food and respected the founder who served his country and started a business in his twilight years but they will NEVER see another dime of mine !!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place the staff was friendly, the food was great. I had the double bacon steak burger, OMG it was so delicious. I highly recommend this place. I will tell all my friends."}
{"text":"I've had many many many good experiences here... The only reason they got 4 stars is they have messed my order up several times but always very quick to fix! ( I get the patty melt which is sour dough and Swiss but I switch to Texas toast and provolone as Swiss doesn't sit right with me) other than that always nice staff and always fast service (does slow it down when they make it wrong but it's well worth the wait) I would get a concrete every visit if the small wasn't so expensive .. So sadly I do not get it often! 

In any case love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
Is this steak n shake's twin? Recently Champaign has a string of burger restaurants opening including Krekel and Oberweiss to name a few. I have been to this restaurant twice and I can honestly say it is on par with the other chains as noted per above. The nice thing about this place is that the food is prepared fresh and they give you ample amount of fries with your combo meal. There fries are the the tiny shoe string fries that you get a Steak n Shake and the freddy fry sauce is a great additiion, however the food is quite greasy and seating can be limited when it is busy. We got the frozen custard the first time we went and it was good, but again you can get the same at Culver's down the street as well. Overall it's nice to have options for fast food, but nothing too unique here.

Pros: food cooked to order, relatively fast service, large portion of fries wit your meal

Cons: very greasy, limited seating at lunch

Hidden deals:
Combo deal to add fries and drink

I showed up around noon on 1/17/2018.  Freddy's was pretty quiet so I didn't have to wait in line.  The cashier greeted me and after I said hello, I tried to place my order.  Here is the what transpired...

Me- \"I'd like the number one please.\"
Cashier-  \"No.\"  ... I smiled thinking it was a joke.
Me-  \"Oh, I forgot, no onions on the burger.\"
Cashier- \"No.\"
Me- \"What?\"
Cashier- \"No.\"
Me- \"Really?\"
Cashier- \"Not happening.\"
Me-  \"Okay, maybe next time.\"

I turned around and walked away.  The joke was on me and I was foolish to believe that Freddy's actually wanted my business.  Why didn't they want my business?  Skin color, religious beliefs, political affiliation...it doesn't make sense.  It was dead in there during the lunch rush.  Perhaps I wasn't the only customer that they turned away that day.

I called the manager to inform him of how I was treated.  He said, \"I can assure you that this is not an isolated situation.\"  How can you assure this?  You were sitting in the back office, not even knowing what was going on during the lunch rush.  He also shared, \"I wish there was something I could do for you.\"  Yeah, I wish there was something you could do.  I let him know that his employee is a direct reflection of him as a leader.  In my opinion his leadership is extremely poor based on his employees actions.

I will never go back to Freddy's."}
{"text":"After several visits to Freddys in Henderson I can honestly say the food is so very tasty with fresh greens to accompany there delicious steakburgers.  The branch on Warm Springs is so friendly from the everyday staff to the management and they always make you feel very welcome.

It has to be one of the most clean fast food outlets I have ever been in which is such a credit to the staff.  The food is quality and not greasy at all and is a treat to eat there.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"This place very has very good burgers and frozen custard, I miss some places from my hometown and Freddys is the closet I can get to it. The wait for the food is a little long but its well worth it when you get your food. Also they have an option of ordering your custard order and saving it until your done eating so that you dont have to rush and get your food. I like that option. They have a small average selections of burgers and fries, but they are like a steak burger. They are great for quick lunch places, or family dining. Every time I have gone here they have not been to overly business, there are always tables open for you to sit. Try them out if your in the mood for a good burger and dont want a chain regular place to go."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy yummy.  I have been meaning to go for a long time and I finally did the other day.  Burgers are delicious, shoestring fries are now my favorite, especially with the Freddie's sauce.  Save room for the frozen custard----good bye ice cream!  A great suggestion from Austin who was very helpful.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Freddy has pretty good burgers, but I like the hot dog with the butter toasted bun . I enjoy the hot dogs plain the way it is with this type of bun. The thin fries are yummy but I wish it was bigger. The dessert. are good, but after my meal I am too full, and no one wants to share with me. I might have to order dessert first or have my meal with no fries......... next review, if I come back."}
{"text":"Definitely a let down. The burger was not even steak and shake quality but was much more expensive and the fries were so seasoned and salty they could barely be eaten. The custard was good. I would only eat there again for the custard and even that is way overpriced. The restaurant was dirty and disorganized."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  I wish they had one in LA but unfortunately they don't.  Freddys Steak Burgers are amazing  taste great  prices were reasonable.  Cool diner atmosphere i would recommend trying it out for sure."}
{"text":"Freddy's in my opinion has an advantage for being the best burger joint than in and out burgers. Freddys burgers seems more juicer and more flavorful maybe becuase the melted cheese helped a lot or the steak that made their burgers? You can taste the quality in every bite if your order a burgers or their philly cheese steak sandwiches also their frozen custard desert grew on me. I wish Freddy's would expand in the SoCal or the Central Valley I think business would be very booming."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews about this particular location I decided to try it on my own and it was a total disappointment. My burger was over cooked to almost crispy and loud obnoxious kids who their parents can't control. Even though my two burgers were over cooked I managed to finish it all because I went shopping all day and picked up some great deals at the Las Vegas north & south outlets. I can remember the first time I ate at Freddy's at the Henderson location it was so good that blows away in & out burger any day. Would I probably return to this location again probably not but I would give another Freddy's location another chance."}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with Freddys.

Clean place great food good service, you can tell the crew works hard and maintain what they have. Its nice that they have Freddys sacue and Freddys seasoning which taste like Red Robins but what do you do...its still good.

Highly recommended if your ever in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoy my visits to Freddy's because they have great steak burgers, onion rings and frozen custard desserts! My favorite is the turtle sundae as I have always enjoyed the combination of pecans, caramel and chocolate! The staff is SUPER friendly and they are consistent in having a great attitude. 

This establishment is always clean and inviting so they get two thumbs up for cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Great burgers made to order with steak. The fries are miniature and crispy. Delicious. The friendly customer service is an added bonus. Walking into a fast food chain now a days you don't expect that. This would be the Chick-fil-A of burger places. Blows in-n-out out of the water. We are from the east coast so this is a nice treat! I didn't have room in my belly to try the custard or cakes but they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place many times and finally decided to stop in.  I had the \"Original Double Patty Melt\".

It was quite possibly one of the worst patty melts in the history of the universe (I'm being generous and leaving open the possibility that there might be even worst).

Each of the two patties was less than 1/8 inch thick. There were a few grilled onions in the center of the sandwich, and no attempt to spread them evenly. 

I also had a chocolate malt and it was just OK.  

For this type of menu, head to Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Had the hatch double cheeseburger combo. Burger over seasoned with their steak seasoning.  Way to much salt. Had grilled peppers and onions. Hardly any hatch green chili's on the burger. A nice large portion of shoestring fries comes with the combo. Nice clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food style burger joint. I'd fight a (small, tired) dude for their burgers. I've tried them just about every way, but the original double with cheese is best. Onion rings are the real deal, and although I'm not a shoestring fry kind of guy, the fries are always hot, salty and tasty and are perfect for dipping by the fist full in hot sauce (*hot sauce not included).

The deserts are great too, I love their custard. The Hawaiian sundae is a must have. I know, I know, you say you don't like macadamia nuts. I'm not a big fan myself, but frozen macadamias are something completly different than their room temperature counterparts. A crunchy, nutty awesomeness that I've never tasted in anything else.

The service is always great too. One time we did have a bit of a mishap, while in the drive through our shakes came out long before our food. Which obviously meant that they had melted by the time we got home. My wife contacted the manager, who showed genuine concern and was nice enough to issue us a gift certificate of a surprisingly significant denomination, sufficient for a few trips back to the drive through.

Contrary to what Curtis Mayfield has advised, I can assure you that Freddy is most certainly NOT dead."}
{"text":"Great fast food and service, awesome onion rings .Much better than steak and shake

Been back several times. Upping to five stars from four. Love this place"}
{"text":"First things first people... It's called the steakburger and shoestring french fries. It's not supposed to be a big thick juicy burger... It's cooked until the ends are caramelized and it's delicious.  Second of all nobody tows cars while you eat here.

That being said this is the best place to get a steak burger and fries in Phoenix! Spectacular customer service, great food and an impeccably clean environment. Every time I come here I am blown away by how nice the staff and management team are to the customers. When I bring my puppy with me they always give her a little bowl for water and come out and pet her."}
{"text":"I tried the steakburger with fries and a cup of vanilla custard.  The steakburger was good, as were the fries, and the custard was outstanding.  This is one of the better burger joints around."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it appears the entire restaurant is moving in slow motion.  Seriously, how long does it take to make a burger and fries?"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place! The employees are all so kind and helpful! The fries are scrumptious and all in all it's a delightful visit!!"}
{"text":"Complete waste of time. Went to the drive-thru to get the fish and chips basket only to be told they were out of fish. If you're out of something, why not put a sign up?! Had to wait behind two huge orders to get out of there. I'll gladly drive out-of-my-way to another location and give them my business."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised that I enjoyed the burger as much as I did. The ice cream is good as well. Not the best but not the worst food either."}
{"text":"I love their vanilla frozen custard! Add a topping and bam, you got a concrete. They have so many toppings to choose from! You can keep it simple with one topping or go crazy and choose a specialty concrete with lots of toppings.

I keep it simple and just add good 'ol Oreo cookies with vanilla custard. Delicious and way better than stupid McDonald's McFrankenstein-Flurry. I've also had a taste of the chocolate concrete with peanut butter added in and it was delicious! Way less sweet than if Reese's peanut butter cups were added in, but that's just me. 

Someday I'll have to try a steakburger. It smells pretty darn good inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good customer service, price was right, and  the food was out fast. Burgers were okay--I've had better, but also much worse. Fries need seasoning. My husband said the hotdog was terrible. But the custard is really amazing. Don't order a double unless you have a BIG appetite."}
{"text":"Our first time eating here. Been waiting for a burger joint like this to open.
We ordered freddys original double, original double patty melt and fries.
The freddy original double and original patty melt was so deliciously juicy. The fries, omg it so so good.
Can't wait to eat there again."}
{"text":"The double patty melt with pickles added at my request was very good. I love rye bread so I knew I'd get the patty melt. The fry sauce is almost 1000 island dressing which I also love. A solid sandwich choice and be sure to ask for pickles if you're a fan as they don't skimp on adding those!
Place was pretty busy, as expected since it's new."}
{"text":"Glad I made it here on my trip to Las Vegas. I saw the sign for the patty melt when I was at Raising Cane's the day before and knew I had to have one. Excellent patty melt, fries and fry sauce. I wish patty melts were a bigger thing in California."}
{"text":"Not bad! The shake was insanely delicious. I think it was the Heath toffee one. The burger was just okay. I'm not sure I care for the texture, and the patty is crazy thin. The chili fries were tasty. I'd go back for the fries and a shake, but it's kind of like Sonic- you don't really go for the food as much as the desserts."}
{"text":"No flavor what so ever?  Dont get the hype. Fries have no flavor either. I guess since they are an established corporation the sheep will flock. I hear their hotdogs are good?  Maybe ill try but for the price the possibilities are small unless I'm desperate."}
{"text":"I've never heard of Freddy's until I was visiting Las Vegas over a weekend, I saw it and thought \"wow, steak burgers and frozen custard sounds delicious.\".  I ended up going for lunch on the way out of town and ordered a regular steak burger with cheese, it did NOT disappoint, the meat was very flavorful and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  The fries were an interesting \"shoestring\" variety but were good.  I ordered a regular vanilla shake which I believe is made from the frozen custard and WOW it was delicious, tasted similar to how a larger chains shakes tasted back in the 80's before they changed them and made them suck.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas, or even in SoCal on my way down to LA since I see there's one in Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Great fast food! Great burgers - great fries - great friendly customer service!

Freddy's is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Freddy's until recently and having gone now a few times and having it be consistent I have to say it's pretty good. It's another fast food chain but, like all the rest, it has a very specific flavor - and in this case the food itself is a bit different from normal and it's definitely there in taste, texture, and look. If you eat a lot of fast food like I do it's always nice to add in another thing to mix up the flavors and textures your mouth deals with.

The burgers are really tasty and it's very confusing when reviews scream about how the burgers aren't giant patties when that isn't the point (I think, and some outright say it so I know, these people expect a T-Bone with a bun on it and get mad when it's not that) because you get even more than some of the other very popular big chains - for example the amount of meat you get here is definitely the same and/or often times more than you get in an In-n-Out double (also delicious though) so there's really nothing to complain about. They don't seem to understand \"steak\" is just a specific cut of meat, not a measurement of amount/weight...

It might look small but it's beefy and fills even someone my size up when you have it and large fries alongside it.

The fries though are probably why I'm taking one star off, while they are totally fine and compliment the burgers well I'm just not a fan of such super-thin fries. I sadly can't talk about the desserts they're apparently so known for as I haven't had any of those yet.

Prices are basically identical to every other fast food chain as well, so that's not really an issue. Glad to have this place so close by."}
{"text":"Im sorry, I just can't believe all the good reviews of this place. I am not a fan. Went for lunch yesterday and ordered the patty melt combo. For being brand new the store looked dirty inside and just not appealing. The girl taking my order did welcome me as I walked in but definately wasnt over friendly. 

The patty melt was not good. The rye bread was soggy and greasy and there was very little cheese. The shoestring fries were cold and soggy as well. Shoestrings should be very crispy since they are small. I did like the fry sauce though. They also have Pepsi which is a negative for me. For $9 In n out or Five guys blows this place away in food quality."}
{"text":"this is the most amazing food. high quality fresh made to order food. the customer service us amazing. they want us to have an amazing experience and go above and beyond to make that happen. they happily oblige special requests and thoughtfully cut my burger because they overheard me say I  eat my burger 1/2 at a time. the only people that treat me better than the staff at Freddys are my husband and my Mom. i love you guys!"}
{"text":"Freddy's is amazinggg! We had burgers, hotdogs, fries, chicken tenders & the dirt and worms custard were sooo good! Resonably priced too! And the staff in the Cornelious location were super nice. Comparable to Steak'n'Shake but 10 times better!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Indiana was the steakburgers and shoestring fries.  We were very happy to find this place when we were on the west side.  The food is tasty and the staff was very friendly.  LOVE the shoestrings!"}
{"text":"For a fast food joint, I don't really have much to complain about. The price is equal to the value of your meal, in my opinion. 

The patties are unique to other burger patties because they have this layer of what looks like a burnt top--hard to describe--but it creates a nice texture and the flavor is good for the most part. 

The only complaint I would have is that their foods are too salty."}
{"text":"Mehhh.... if you like Big Mac's you might like this place. I found the meat to be mushy and lackluster. I don't get the hype at all. I ordered a #1 combo (cheeseburger, fries, drink). I gave it 2 stars only because it was affordable and the girl at the drive through was very nice. I didn't try the custard, but I didn't really want to after I had the burger. I've had much better, even at Carl's Jr!... Sorry :("}
{"text":"Its fast food, so its hard to go above 3 or 4 stars.  In my opinion better than the mainstays like McDonalds, BK, Wendy's and just a bit below In n Out.  Burgers are different but very flavorful.  My wife was excited as she is a huge Steak and Shake fan, she said these were good too, very similar to her favs from the Midwest.  I liked the thin shoestring fries very tasty.  I didn't have a custard of my own my the wife did and it was good.  A great place to take the kids for an above average fast food meal, heck, if i was driving by and was hankering a burger in the middle of the day I certainly would be back."}
{"text":"For a fast food hamburger joint, I really like Freddy's.  It tastes and feels different than your normal McDonalds and Burger King. The hamburgers are really good but be warned the patty itself is super skinny.  Also, they have the skinny french fries which I prefer over the fat ones!   If you have room after your meal, try the frozen custard.  I usually have a mix of chocolate and vanilla, bet they have many options to suit your taste.

This restaurant (fast food) reminds me of a place from back east called Friendlys..not sure if they are still around."}
{"text":"Delicious steak burgers!!  Lucky for me, they also offer any of their sanwiches in a lettuce wraps!!  Oh, and you can get grilled onions by request. 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"For being the first time being here i expected more, first off it took a while to get the food,i understand its the late shift and the employees just wanna go home but quality should be precise. The meat just seems so dry and flavorless. We got no napkins and to top it off the fries were really stale, makes you wonder if they really \"cook before you order\". Overall place is decent, theres a slight chance ill go back."}
{"text":"I brought my littest Little here for a special treat after her recent doctor visit; she had to get immunizations in order to get ready for Kindergarten, and in my family shots *always* require post appointment ice cream....STAT. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries, lemonade, and a 'Dirt Cup' for us to share.  The chicken sandwich was hot, juicy and delicious.  The fries and their special fry sauce was really unique and yummy.  (We didn't leave a single fry survivor, we killed them all.)  And her frozen 'Dirt Cup' vanilla custard with gummy worms and chunks or Oreo cookie was creamy, smooth and perfect for curing post-shot frowns.

The restaurant was spotless and the employees that served us all displayed a high level of customer service and were extremely friendly and efficient.  We left there very impressed an will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"They butchered the order, unfortunately. Malt means malt not milkshake. You also cannot enter the wrong size and expect the customer to take the fall. I was charged correctly for what I got but it was not what I ordered. They just found it easier if i felt i made the mistake.  Sad. No problem solving skills. Food was horribly cold and generally sucked."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan at first, due to me ordering the California style burger. These burgers are meant to be eaten with just pickles and mustard, maybe a little bit of mayo. Once I ordered them the original style, I found out they are pretty darn good. The fries are great as well, matchstick sized fries. My girlfriend loves the concrete ice cream desserts."}
{"text":"For a fast food place this ranks very high. Went for the first time yesterday and through the drive through. Quick and very pleasant staff. Their patty melt is actually first rate. I always try patty melts when available anywhere and rarely are they very good. Freddies was excellent, good rye bread, grilled onions, Swiss cheese. Almost perfect. Wife had a regular double cheeseburger and was very pleased. Their shoestring fries are great,  well cooked and tasty . Lastly their shakes were very good too. All and all great fast food."}
{"text":"Their  chocolate and vanilla custard is yummy!
I preferred the hard to take home rather than the soft serveI. I LOVE the shoestring  fries!  The special sauce they give you to go with them is amazing. If I'm willing to wait  an extra few minutes, they are always happy to give me a fresh batch of fries. I like them piping hot!!!

After I watch the documentary What the Health on Netflix I choose not to eat either one but noT because  they are not tasty! 

I personally didn't like the steak burgers or the hotdogs even when I ate meat but they deserve four stars just for the custard and fries!"}
{"text":"Hamburger was yummy. The fries are the real skinny, shoestring ones which I do not care for as much. The servers here are outstanding. They even gave me a free sample of their custard which is delicious. Reminds me of a Steak and Shake with a smaller menu. Pretty good overall."}
{"text":"I have returned several times after my initial visit and I have to say, I haven't enjoyed really any of the food I've tried so far. Chicken sandwich was bland, veggie burger was bland, burger was bland, fries were bland, hot dog was bland. I see a common thread amongst the food. The only thing I really like and actually return for are the concretes and one in particular. I enjoy the Hawaiian Delight.  They have a drive thru so if I'm coming here, that's why.

I'll skip the food from now on."}
{"text":"I order a kids meal also order a meal that i thought would be fit for an adult my buger was the exact same size as the kids meal, they need to beef it up a little more than that."}
{"text":"I typically do not like shoestring fries but Freddy's are very good. Everything else on the menu is pretty good too. I like that the burgers are not typical of fast food places. The thin patties remind me more of what you get from a diner. Oh and the frozen custard shakes are much better than the ones at Culvers."}
{"text":"Dont mind the wait...its worth it. Patty melt did not disappoint! The fries can make you angry because they are \"shoestring\" style and you cant get enough of them in your face at one time! We will be back to try the frozen custards in the near future."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few more times since the review and their burgers and shoestring fries are some of the best (and cheapest) around.  Their Freddy Sauce is a newfound joy to my tastebuds.....now if they only served beer!"}
{"text":"My first time @ Freddy's.   Well.... I'll be coming back. Really good burgers and shoestring potatoes.  Love the Freddy's sauce with jalapeños.  Spicy but not over the top.  

Had the Single California style with grilled onions and it,  along with the fries,  filled me up.  

Cute 50's style diner with comfortable booths and 50's music playing over the speakers.  

Staff was nice and personable. Place was clean and welcoming. 

Just moved here and my family likes to come here about 7 times a month...  Think I'll be eating here as often now!"}
