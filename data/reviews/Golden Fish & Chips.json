{"text":"Golden Fish & Chips is doing everything right! Cant get much better that this for the price's offered and good portions! Used to be Cash Only but they got a Debit Machine a year ago and its so much more convenient! Can't get enough of this cute & homey restaurant! Great and friendly staff too! Definitely a place everyone should try!"}
{"text":"THE BEST FISH & CHIPS!!!!!! I love Goldens! Great staff and great food. Always fresh and cooked to perfection! If I could eat here everyday I would."}
{"text":"Best fish n chips in town. Won't go anywhere else. Nice white clean fish. Beer batter is awesome. Perfect chips every time. Also offers \"Newfie mess\" fries. Will talk phone orders so you don't have to wait in line. Extremely busy on Thursday and Fridays but so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Probably best fish and chips I've had in the GTA. Being from BC, I've had better and they could do a couple things to bring their rating up (better decor, serve beer, homemade tatar, etc...). That said, they're still very good. The fries are fresh cut, batter is nice and light and this fish is good quality. I think the owner always seems to be the one cooking the fish, so he has it just right and it doesn't come out very greasy or overcooked."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of options for classic English style Fish and Chips in Georgetown and this place shows it.  It's adequate but not great.  Adorned with worn tables, dusty fish decorations and a soaked in smell of oil, as a restaurant, this isn't somewhere you would go to enjoy a meal with friends or family.  It's an in-and-out Fish and Chips shack, nothing more, nothing less.  I like Fish and Chips.  I grew up in a town with 3 Fish and Chip restaurants that competed heavily both in price and quality for business.  Golden Fish & Chips obviously doesn't have this competition.  Their cuts of Fish are thin and the batter is glassy and crispy rather then pillowy and light.  The Fries are cut in a shoestring style and taste like they've been frozen.  When either the Fish or the Fries cool, you're left with a silken aftertaste and layer of \"something\" in your mouth.  While my comments on the food have been straightforward and honest, I have no problem giving this place an average, \"A-OK\" score because it's not bad - it's just not great."}
{"text":"The owner is great. I ordered my fish and chips on Good Friday, which was quite busy. They ran out of tartar sauce and he was apologetic. He then went to a convenience store and made some while I waited. Great owner. This is the kind of service that will bring me back. And the fish and chips were great!  Thank you, my family was very happy."}
{"text":"First time here and I very pleased.    Batter on the dish is perfect , not to thick like some places.      Halibut was delicious, not too greasy.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"One of the best fish & chips restaurants I've been to in awhile.  The oil in the fryer is always fresh and the fish does actually come out golden colour and not brown like most of the fish & chips places these days from over using the oil."}
{"text":"If you grew up anywhere in Ontario this is the way fish 'n' chips are made here. Light, softer batter with flatter thinner fillets of haddock or halibut. If you are from the East Coast or even England, this method will be foreign to you. Classic English fish 'n' chips have a crispier, darker batter and appear slightly thicker.   Both are great in their own respects depending on where you have them, but make no mistake, Golden Fish & Chips makes them the classic Ontario way. From the batter to the fries to the unique tasty gravy, their fish 'n' chips tastes exactly the way I remember them growing up in the 70s in many small towns throughout southern Ontario.  The decor might bring back some found memories too! But why focus on the decor when you're in the mood for fresh made, classic ONTARIO fish 'n' chips! Always hits the spot, don't change."}
