{"text":"A total gem, right here in Chateauguay!  My fave Italian place around these parts.  I much prefer it over Il Vincino..."}
{"text":"Their pizza is absolutely delicious. But during my last two visits there have been several issues related to service, or lack thereof. We waited over half an hour to find out that our waitress forgot to place our order. The food was good, when it arrived, so we decided to try it again. This time it took about 10 minutes to be served by someone from the kitchen. The waitress arrived, brought us a glass of water and took our order. Another member of staff brought us our salad, and pizza. (We ordered Pepperoni, but received All Dressed). And we finished our meal, and took our own pizza back to the counter to get the leftovers wrapped up and asked for the bill. No sight of the waitress. So we paid up, and left. Maybe we'll pick up our order next time, rather than dine-in. 

The design is a very retro-70's style Italian eatery, and it would have been nice if they had kept it that way, but they moved over the water fountain along the wall and placed in a huge flat screen tv in it's place. It sort of hurt the atmosphere this place once had. They did add outdoor dining, which has a nice seating area, where you can watch the cars and people go about their daily lives. (Just as long as the service staff doesn't forget that we're out there!)"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best place for pizza in the area. It's absolutely delicious. Their service is always friendly too. The only con about this place is the prices. It can be a little more expensive than other pizza joints. But, here you really are paying for what you get. It's worth every penny."}

Yet another gem from my childhood; no food poisoning here though.

     A great 'little Italian place' with delicious pasta dishes if you are eating in house and they have one of the two best pizzas, deliverable, in chateauguay.

     My Favourite is the Po-Potte, it's an all dressed pizza(that is green pepper, mushrooms and pepperoni) with bacon onion an green olives.

      Depending on what order you were in the delivery mans drop off, your pie may sog slightly due to the copious amount of toppings...throw her in the oven at 400 for 5 mins and she'll be right as rain...if you like a crispier crust...
