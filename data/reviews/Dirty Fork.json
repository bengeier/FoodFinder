{"text":"Do not waste your time! Inattentive staff and longer than normal waits for average but over-priced food. There are several better options in the area for both breakfast and lunch. In addition, the management is arrogant and rude. Obviously, we had a bad experience there and I hope that this post keeps you from making the same mistake. Please take your $40 to a place where they will be honored to have your patronage."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Eggs made perfect. Please try their coffee nice and smooth. We will return"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I can't believe anyone would leave a negative review for this restaurant. I'm so glad I didn't let that stop me from coming here. The staff was attentive and friendly without being over bearing. Our server KJ was very helpful and pleasant. The restaurant itself is decorated simply and beautifully. The menu, which is a French Hawaiian mix,  is creative and fun. I went with two other people for breakfast and we were all very pleased with our choices. I can't wait to go back for the afternoon tea, what an awesome concept. Definitely give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"I am glad I take negative reviews with a grain of salt. We really enjoyed our breakfast. I had the Fatty Burrito and hash browns. My wife had I'm Easy. Everything came out super fresh and tasted amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food. Family approved. But no kids menu. Ours did waffles and pancakes from the adult. (Around 12 bucks.) Thankfully we had a Groupon."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing service! The best fries in Vegas, and even the simplest meals like a grilled cheese or burger is packed with flavor. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Just had breakfast, egg white omelette was perfection! We will be back"}
{"text":"First of all, the young gal who waited on us was very nice and attentive.   True, it was a Saturday morning and there was only one other table besides us, but her service was nothing less than stellar.  Unfortunately, the food was forgettable and pricey.  Lots of breakfast places around to pick from...sadly, I'll be picking one other than the Dirty Fork."}
{"text":"Came to this place based on ratings..won't do that again.  The place was nice, but the service was very slow and the food overpriced and nothing to rave about.  It took like 20 min or so to get regular coffee  and the owner comes over to us apologizing and says that the coffee will be free and that he just opened the place 2 or 3 weeks ago and doesn't have enough servers.  When I ordered the crepes with nutella, one with banana and one without, I was told by the waitress that she wasn't going to tell the cooks that because they were so busy and it was going to make them mad, that she could tell them to put the banana on the side.  The place was not even at full capacity, and there certainly wasn't a crowd waiting for a table.   And they still didn't get the order right anyway!  My instinct was to get up and go but I decided to let it slide.  I ordered the Vegas Style Toast and it simply was not good.  The poached eggs were still kind of raw and were totally bland.  It grossed me out so I had the waitress take it.  I decided to only order a bagel instead of a new full dish because of how long it took to get our food in the first place.  Even that took like 10 minutes!  My son's hash browns with onions were burned and  he said that the crepes we make at home were better.  I tried the omelette my husband ordered and we agreed that wasn't good either.  When it came time to pay the bill the Vegas Toast had not been removed.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that her boss said we still had to pay for it.  I was obviously not happy with having to pay for a dish that was so disgusting to me.  I took my kids and went to wait for my husband in the car I was so pist.  When my husband comes out he says he told the owner that I didn't like what I got and the owner responded by saying that I didn't like a lot of things, that I wasn't in the mood.   What a professional!  Don't try to pin on me the fact that the food and service was so damn shitty!  This guy clearly has no experience in the food business and much less in customer service!  I doubt this place will be open for long.  Even the waitress told my husband that it wasn't right that we had to pay for the dish.  The one star for this place is too much!"}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation, great service and a great brunch! The Breakfast Burrito was fresh and delicious! Definitely recommend to both locals and those visiting!"}
{"text":"went here yesterday........ food was great had the french toast and  fried chicken with strawberry's was so yummy great twist on chicken and waffles. Waitress we friendly and service was perfect."}
{"text":"Ok. Where to start... been bookmarked for quite some time. Love all the #dirtyfork pics on instagram. Finally got here with my daughter. She knows her food.  We got: dirty fork lunch special: too much going on. Like wayyyy too much. Texture was strange. It was beautifully plated. It truly gave me the same feeling as the restaurant itself- confused. Too many \"good\" ideas. Mis mashed. How do I explain this... from the decor to the food. It just felt... confused is the only word that comes to mind.  turkey sammy: good... I think. I dunno, again- too much. Hard to get a complete bite. I like my sandwiches stable. I like them balanced. short stack of island pancakes: GREAT. all the syrups were yummy. They were fluffy, light, absolutely delicious.  Here's the bottom line- go. Try it. Make up your own mind. Support small businesses. My take is just that- mine.  (ATTN OWNER!!!)Last BUT NOT LEAST- get rid of the elevator music please. I think that was the worst. Waited quite a while for our food and the music in the background just made it feel like I was in a doctors office. Play some chill good vibe island sounds. Isn't that your \"thing\"?? Again- confused."}
{"text":"Food presentation and appetizing menu were fantastic!  Recommend going during off-peak times."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast thru Grubhub.  I was quoted 60-70 minutes for delivery.  I called after 90 minutes to learn that they 'were busy and were just working on my order'...I would not have recieved it for another 30 minutes.  They were not willing to make any accomodations for it taking two hours to get the delivery.  I ended up cancelling and will not order from them or go there to eat again... Dirty Fork - if you can't get the food out, then don't take the order!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to the Dirty Fork and if I didn't have a Groupon it would have been our last. We were seated,never asked what we wanted to drink ,waited for 10 minutes without a return by the sole server in the restaurant yet two tables were seated after us were served drinks. Pitiful.  My mom even went up to the counter to try and get someone one to wait on us and that did nothing. We ended up leaving and going to Norm's diner just down the street where we were seated promptly,drink orders taken immediately and a server over a few minutes to take our order. Much better experience there than the dirty fork.  If I didn't want to lose my money on a Groupon I wouldn't go back. The management needs to get a much better system in place and more staff on hand. If not it's going to be the same thing over and over again."}
{"text":"Food was good enough and looked pretty once it finally came out... it just took forrrrrrrever to come out (and they weren't even that busy)."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit Vegas about 4 times per year and always rent a car because we enjoy seeing more of the city than The Strip & Fremont Street. This new (opened early this year) breakfast and lunch spot is a little out of the way but worth the trip. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and the food they prepare is top notch at a reasonable price. My wife's egg white omelette and my bacon & scrambled eggs were both top notch. The service was quick and attentive. The owner pointed out that the hardest part of launching a new dining spot is making people aware you're there. From experience, I can say with certainty that once discovered, they will have no difficulty in seeing repeat business. Oh, and the forks are sparkling clean"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Vegas. Fatih, the owner is very friendly and attentive and that obviously carries over to his staff. The dirty fork special is my favorite. I may try some other items on other visits but it's hard for me to get away from that one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here - always looking for a good breakfast place and I think I found one! Interesting menu (both breakfast and lunch) - healthy choices with a Hawaiian flavor. Their omelette was delicious- light and fluffy, and comes with a small green salad if you want instead of hash browns. The dining room is open with lots of tables as well as a counter. Overall a nice addition to my breakfast dining choices!"}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon and decided to give it a try for the first time after church. It wasn't very busy but for some reason service started out supet slow about 10 minutes before we even had our drink order taken. This instantly had our minds made up not to come back. Then a gentleman from behind the bar came out and handled our drink order (I'm assuming he was the owner) very friendly and personable. Once the food came out we were sold! Avocado Toast with a perfectly poached egg was on point. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Highly recommend! Food presentation is great, and the food is super delicious! Owner is super nice and accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to have a tasty breakfast or lunch.  We ordered petite beurre panini and it was  delicious!  Their coffee is awesome too!  Cozy atmosphere, and friendly environment.  The prices are reasonable.  I got my list to come this place frequently. Must visit"}
{"text":"Aloha spirit on 10! Irma was an amazing server and very attentive! Food was delicious, coffee was bomb! Very clean and comfortable. Made me feel like i was on the island!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special and it was delicious! Such a cute spot. They have a variety of breakfast and lunch options. Pretty pastries in the refrigerator up front."}
{"text":"I am always for a new brunch experience!  FOOD: The presentation of their dishes are pretty. The Happy Hippie Kale Salad was a refreshing salad served with an avocado dressing. I was not a fan of the dressing, but the salad itself was refreshing made with quality ingredients. I was really excited to try the Ms. Lorraine Quiche. The bacon, cheese, and egg was cooked perfectly and literally melted in my mouth. My only thing was it was cold when it was served to me and I did not like the crust at all. I prefer my quiche to be more flaky in texture. The Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese is always a must order everywhere I go. But unfortunately, it was also cold by the time it was served to me. The soup was decent, but I was not too crazy about the grilled cheese, I think it was the type of bread used. The food is good, but I think they should work on their recipes a bit more.  BAKERY: The owners seem to focus on recommending customers their bakery items more than their menu items. The macaroons were delicious and I highly recommend trying them. Their croissants and almond croissants were okay, but I wasn't too crazy about it. They were a bit hard for croissants.  DRINK: They serve the basic coffee, latte, and tea items you would want for brunch. Nothing too special. Water is served in a glass bottle.  ATMOSPHERE: This restaurant is a cross between a casual and fancy coffee shop. I have to say the service was great. Our waiter was really friend and attentive. I love the look of the place with the bright blue walls and shiny floors."}
{"text":"Kj was a super cool server! Owner was really nice came over to check on us to make sure everything was tasting good. Beautiful presentation and everything tasted absolutely amazing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Not sure why it's more important to roll silverware than check on customers but it's not like it was super busy and short staffed. Specifically asked for no bell peppers since they make me sick and I open my omelet? and immediately bell peppers come out. The servers' response \"well I put no bell peppers, sorry\". Basically the server equivalent of \"not my fault and not my problem\". Would have been manageable if the omelet? had been good but it clearly wasn't mixed well since some parts had too much flavor and other parts were extremely bland. No in between. Tried to enjoy the toast since my omelet wasn't good but my first bite, I cut my gum on the rock-hard? crust. Fabulous. I'll deal with sub par food or bad service but both? No thanks."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, great service, awesome breakfast options and you gotta try the Hawaiian French toast!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, exceptional service. Great veggie omelet! It doesn't look like much food but I left full and happy. It was my boyfriend's first time and he loved it! Deffinaly will be returning. The best part is the have a Groupon available, always love to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Found this ittle gem on Groupon and loved it!  Excellent food quality and presentation.  The burger and chicken pesto panini were superb. Their almond croissants are incredible!   A good locally owned establishment that is definitely worth a try.  The modern, clean, and cozy decor awaits you."}
{"text":"Incredible. Absolute perfection for Sunday brunch. The staff and owner are lovely. The food is bursting with flavor. Can't skip the 9th Island French Toast with guava cream cheese!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: looks like newly renovated, upscale look, with authentic wood finishes, good for family breakfast  Cleanliness: 10/10 super clean  Food: 10/10 the taste is so tasty, i got the french kiss crepes with everything in it(nutella-my favorite, strawberries and organic banana) from scratch!   Service: Friendly  staff, i even met with the owner, he gave me a 25% discount which i wasn't expecting:-)"}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews of this place so I wanted to check this place out for myself. A friend and I visited here yesterday for brunch and I liked it. The staff was really nice and the place was clean.   I was craving something sweet so I ordered the 9th Island French Toast. It had several different tropical flavors on it and I liked it. My friend ordered the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and she really liked it. I had a bite of it and I really liked the fried chicken on the french toast with the strawberries. Only issue I had with it was it is a tad pricey for being a breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here with my mom this morning, and we were both so impressed! Everything tasted delicious! The coffee was nice and strong, and my cup never got more than halfway empty before it was topped off. All the food we got was obviously fresh as well! Plus, we thought the interior was adorable! It is a small restaurant, but with a ton of natural light, bright walls, and exposed brick, it didn't feel tiny. We will definitely be returning the next time we want to go out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but we had a great experience overall. The food was deliciously fresh! The breakfast was plated very beautiful and had s fresh modern twist to the usual American-Hawaiian fusion brunch food. I was definitely pleasantly surprised with the Vegas Style Toast with salmon, avocado, cream and fresh berries! I would definitely recommended to try Dirty Fork for brunch or even a coffee!    Can't to come back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Visited the Dirty Fork for the first time (used my Groupon) while visiting my brother in Vegas. Cafe was small, quaint and clean! Service was great! Food was yummy. Nice atmosphere for a couple or some friends meeting to have breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. We were greeted as we walked in and service was fast and friendly. The 9th island French toast is delicious. The guava cream cheese they put on it left me wanting more!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed in the service... I ordered food at 12pm for delivery and it's been almost two hours and my food hasn't arrived. I called the restaurant to see what the status was, and all they said is that \"they're leaving soon and it's on it's way.\" Normally I'm super super nice about things and never complain because I know the restaurant business is rough. But, I would've liked for them to be more courteous. I hope that when the food gets here it's worth the wait. :(  Update: When the food got here, it was actually a really great burger. I'm sure the restaurant was busy today, and I have a feeling they might have just forgot our order amongst their pickups, and dine-ins. The delivery man was apologetic when he brought the food so that was nice."}
{"text":"The menu selection is fantastic!the presentation of the food is excellent as well.i totally recommend this establishment!perfect for breakfast &brunch."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time! Food was fresh, delicious & nice presentation! Best croissant, bacon, egg, cheese & avocado sandwich. Clean restaurant & terrific staff. Will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and again I was not disappointed with the food nor service. Both times I came for breakfast. The food was fresh and presentation was nice. If you like Turkish coffee, this is the place for you- My husband had three cups. It's about a 10 minute drive from the strip, well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident as the restaurant that used to be here apparently moved to the next corner. Overall not impressed and from the crowd no one else was either as there was only one other table occupied on a Friday morning at 8 am. They appear to over complicate their food in an attempt to dazzle you with mediocrity and premium prices. They need to realize not everyone is looking for mixed greens with their eggs, I would actually pay a premium to keep the mixed greens off my eggs. So we chose to go to another restaurant that doesn't over complicate their food to begin with. Not sure what the intent is with this place but it certainly isn't good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Right when I walked in I was lost..I was here for Norma's breakfast restaurant. Lol. Decided to try it. Why not support a new business. In the initial walk in, wasn't greeted with a welcoming smile. Restaurant is silent. Very boujee style environment. Server Carisa didn't even introduce herself. She didn't smile once, brought my mood down.  Ordered the fatty burrito with chicken instead of bacon. Everything is organic. Served filtered water room temp which I like. -Overall:  This is a organic breakfast brunch with a fusion of island flavor with customer service that'll make you depressed."}
{"text":"The food is greasy, oily and unhealthy in every way. It was a big mistake to eat here.The place was essentially empty at 1:00 PM on a Saturday, which should ha e been my first clue."}
{"text":"Nice food presentation however; not my cup of tea.  The host lacked personality and for the place to be pretty empty the waited too long for a seat and service.  I can now take this spot off my bucket list.  First impressions are everything to me, especially  when I'm spending my money."}
{"text":"I happened upon this restaurant by mistake and boy am I glad I did! Almost 80% organic and the owner and chef Fatih was very very nice and hospitable! The food is excellent! The portions are perfect and the overall experience was great! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I had the dirty fork breakfast special.... Hawaiian sweet bread French toast egg in center, topped with fried chicken. OMG..so good.  The Coffee is amazing and loved the cool jazz in the background.  Too hot to sit outside but next time for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place through groupon... where I got a really great deal - pay $8 for $30 worth of food! (unfortunately I cannot read and it is not valid on weekends:( ) We had intended on using our groupon on a Sunday morning so we went a little overboard on ordering food... since the groupon was not valid I believe the total came to around $55 for 2 people for breakfast, but we did order an iced latte, gatorade, 2 breakfast entree and pancakes! The pancakes were out of this world! I could drink the coconut syrup (there were other unique syrup options as well!) The server was very sweet and had great customer service."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal.  Freas squeezed orange juice.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is such an underrated breakfast resturant in las vegas. We came in expecting it to be a decent place but boy were we surprised! I order the What The Fork Omelet, because I always order the house name dish, and it was one of the most delicious omelets I've ever had. I'm coming back tomorrow to try more deliciousness :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice brunch on the patio with my two dogs and husband.  Dog bowls and treats were complentary and a nice added touch. The menu I loved lots of healthy choices even organic options.  Very clean friendly environment. Right across the street from Desert Breeze park makes it nice to go to park with kids and or dogs then have breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Worst food and staff ever!!! No body there cares about anything they are doing. Dirty is the right word!!!! It's disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Ah I seriously don't like to leave bad reviews, and have only ever left one. This one just needs to be said. Came here after reading a great review and was really excited. Looks mostly cute and modern minus the very tacky ornaments and black curled ribbon hanging everywhere. Those IKEA lights would look a million times better if they didn't have all those extra frills suffocating them. I wanted to cut them down so bad! Please adjust this and let your restaurant be a restaurant and not a quinceanera who's favorite color is teal. Okay no that's not most important, the food clearly is.  We glanced over the menu and saw some awesome looking things. Lady at the table next to me had this great looking frittata style dish and I had to get that. But first I saw \"Scone with clotted cream and jam.\" I bounced at the idea of that, since I love European baked goods and the fact it came with clotted cream was epic! Well my waitress suggests to NOT heat the scone because the cream get gross on top. On top? Cream is not on the side as traditionally served I asked? No she said. Okay so I took her suggestion. Scone comes, with no clotted cream and jam, it's triangular and flat, and has a hard glaze over it. Ummmm wtf? This is zero like any scones with clotted cream and jam. So I try it and my fork almost broke off. Hard as a rock. Literally. I could throw this against the wall. I tell the waitress how this has no cream or jam and is hard as a rock and I want to trade out. She's confused. Says she can bring me cream cheese and jam. What?! That's NOT clotted cream. So now my dreams of a warm scone and clotted cream, which if you're wondering at this point what that is, we'll it's divine. Like a smooth, spreadable slightly sweetened marriage of whipped cream and butter. Usually served cold next to a warm scone. So now you can see why I'm so bummed. I ask for a chocolate croissant because now I'm really wanting to feed my pastry hankering and if a restaurant is going to have a display case of great pastries, well I'm trying. She brings out and then, only then, offers to warm it. Uhh ya, who doesn't want a warm pastry? It returns warm and I try to stick my fork in and yet again, stale, hard, gross. WHYYYYYY?????? You are offering such great pastries on your menu but they've been refrigerated and hard as rocks?! Then they are served nothing as described on the menu? Come on. Okay that was just the appetizer which at this point I've eaten neither. My dish comes out and is served with a small side salad which I like and can identify the yummy raspberry dressing from a local grocery store. Definitely not homemade. So that's three things I've eaten now that are clearly not freshly made at this restaurant. So what is made there? I go to eat my quiche/ frittata dish and hmmm, damn....no luck here. The egg is just straight up mush. Like full of liquid and I'm worried it's not even edible. I'm so hungry though and the favors are good, but the texture is just soooooo gross. Like not fully cooked. I completely struck out and will never return. Such a bummer because it seemed so cute and had a chic menu. They really gotta hit the drawing boards again before serving another dish."}
{"text":"My new spot!   Me and my doggies loved the service here.   There is no doggie menu, so bring your own treats, but there do bring out a water bowl.   The coffee was smooth not too strong or bitter.  I had the turkey sandwich which was fresh.  Love the avocado smash on the bread.  My friend had the Ceasar Salad ...it was generously loaded with cheese and he requested bacon rather than chicken and they accommodated. Also ingredients are fresh and organic.    While our service was great! I was more impressed by the owner coming out and asking if everything was ok and he warmly greeted my dogs."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the service was terribly slow. We waited over 50 minutes for our food. During the wait, I saw at least three tables walked out because of the long wait. They claimed they only have one cook but first of all, this is an excuse as it's not the customers problem and they kept taking in customers which they couldn't afford to help. Obviously the owner wasn't experienced in the business as he would try to seat 4 people when he wasn't even getting the table ready for them. A piece of advice: leave plenty of time for the wait."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Portions are on the small side for the price. Expensive for breakfast. My small omelet was $11.50 and it came w/1 piece of toast and a small salad. Another person had the waffle- yes 1 waffle cut into fourths. The fruit was extra so $10.50+. Nothing on the side unless ordered from sides menu. Coffee was great. The service was slow and disorganized-waited forever for coffee refill, our food sat on the counter while the chef tried to get the server's attention, took forever to get the check. The room had a very unpleasant smell- not sure what that's about."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out last week and we were not disappointed! We went on a Wednesday morning and it wasn't busy at all. Our server was so sweet and very attentive. The food was delicious and the presentation was clean and oh so pretty! I ordered the breakfast burrito and they allowed me to substitute the bacon for veggie sausage. So good! I definitely would suggest giving this place a try. Can't wait to go back and try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out since it says dog friendly. When we walked in the staff greeted us nicely and seated us by the door so the dog wouldn't disturb other customers. She was very friendly and patiently waited for us to make decisions on our meal. However, she messed up on my order, but it's understandable that people make mistakes. She was very apologetic about the mistake and asked several times to make sure I was fine with the order she thought I wanted. Overall, the staffs were great, there was a lot to choose from the menu, and the food was wonderfully presented. I would definitely go back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim at 7 am on a Sunday. We were the only table for the duration of our meal, and the food, ambience, and service were all fantastic! Delicious coffee and pastries. And the hash browns are the best I've ever had. The menu is lighter and more creative than many of the choices here; we will be back.  (The only improvement I can suggest is to add mimosas & bloodies to the menu!!)"}
{"text":"Definitely unique food that are very beautifully displayed. Will continue to return here until I'm able to have said I've tried everything on their menu! - also, a very chill vibe! Love it!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with sister here. It was very bright and we were seated quickly. Everything we ordered was delicious. Server had good recommendations. I was happy to see that there were healthy and organic options. My avocado toast was great. And the manager checked to see how everything was. Overall very good experiences."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, fresh, great menu, very friendly and helpful staff. As a vegetarian, there are many choices. I'll be eating here often.  I'm pretty much regular now. Always get the same thing - Avocado Toast, because they do it right. Lots of great healthy choices. No nutritional regrets when eating here. Everything is healthy, made to order."}
{"text":"Found this hidden jewel today. I had the waffle and it was so good. The fruits on top were so fresh and my hubby's meal was delicious. Coffee was great and the pastries look sooo good. Customer service was excellent. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Well we gave them a second chance and it went great. Food was great and service excellent. Atmosphere was very friendly and calm."}
{"text":"This is a really underrated bistro... you'd think it would be in Summerlin or Downtown in the kitchy areas of Vegas. Great place for breakfast, lunch or brunch. The coffee is amazing too! The Madame is my wife's favorite. The béchamel sauce on it is divine. The salads are great! You can tell the ingredients are quality. You can tell the difference between the Chefs and short order cooks... There is a lot of pride taken here! Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"I can tell you that the food DID NOT look like the photos.   Came in for lunch and being the only table in there raised some concerns. We got French toast and the madam sandwich. The sandwich tasted like cheap biscuits and gravy but maybe I'm just spoiled from Paris? But the bechamel had a really grainy texture and it was just basic ham. The French toast was good but nothing to brag about it, not to mention that there wasn't any guava cream cheese on it like the menu advertises.   The pictures really made me want to come in and unfortunately I most likely won't be coming back.   On to the next food venture!"}
{"text":"Unusual name and unusually tasty eats! Another cute new breakfast and lunch option in Vegas, with a creative menu with a Hawaiian influence. The Breakfast Special (riffing on chicken and waffles) and their Lunch Special (with salmon!) are unique options that have several flavors and textures to prevent food FOMO. If you're into sweets, get a side of their guava cream cheese, which was the tastiest version I've come across! Prices are a couple bucks higher than warranted but the food itself is solid. Avoid the acai and yogurt bowls.   Bring a friend to catch up with because, as other reviews mention, this place runs on island time and lengthy wait times are typical. On two different visits, there was just one lady serving as hostess, server, food runner, and busser, which is a bit much for any one person but especially difficult during their busier weekend hours. Check for a Groupon or Yelp deal before visiting to knock off a couple bucks."}
{"text":"Great place, good service, excellent food.  They allow dogs too.  Had a great time!!  Owner came out and chatted with us.  Nice guy.  Definitely recommend this place and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST BRUNCH I've had since moving to this beautiful city. I'd totally work here and accept their French toast as payment. I had the Vegas Style Avacado Toast topped with amazing. Fresh smoked salmon and a side of fruits/ berries. Great atmosphere. Calm. Gentle. Clean bathrooms and just an over all pleasant experience. Tables outside for outdoor seating. Pet dogs welcomed (they're greeted with doggy treats and a fresh water bowl).   Service was very pleasant, food was DELICIOUS. The owner himself walks around making sure all customers are good. My fiancé had the French toast which I had to try then confiscated the last few bites off her plate. Happy to see their accepted and listed on food delivery apps locally. I'm definitely making this place part of my healthy eating lifestyle."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. service was excellent though. Comparing it to other brunch places as far as food I wasn't very impressed. I had French toast with chicken and fruit on top. We used a Groupon $14 for $20 worth of food. So that was a pretty good deal. No problems when trying to redeem it."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch today to try this out with the family.  We actually tried going to a different spot but the wait was 30min and I didn't want to wait so we came her next.   No wait. It was actually really empty on a Saturday morning at 11:00am.  It doesn't matter but we got here and I wanted to try the dishes they are known for so I ordered their Dirty Fork Breakfast.  The kids had the blueberry pancake and my husband ordered their turkey sandwich.   Blueberry pancake: My kids didn't like the blueberries.  That was my fault in ordering it.  They said that the blueberry in the pancake tasted funny.  So, I tried it.  It was fine. I guess the kids don't like Blueberry?  My Dirty Fork Breakfast was AWESOME!   My son took the french toast bread and my daughters took the strawberry and eggs. I was left with some fried chicken.    My husbands turkey sandwich:  The sandwich was suppose to have sprouts but it didn't come with any. He also said that the turkey was too thin compared to what you'd get at other diners. So he didn't like his sandwich but he was so hungry he ate the whole thing.   Service: AMAZING.  But then again, we were the only ones in the restaurant. The lady was super nice and came back many times to help us out. I wished there were more people in there.    It's not bad. I am just surprised nobody was there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a cute and quaint restaurant . The staff is always pleasant and courteous. Food is always fresh and delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"1st time eating here & it was superb! Cute decor & friendly staff. I definitely enjoyed my breakfast."}
{"text":"Great location, catchy name... great presentation on there food... food was excellent and delicious ... very appealing choices of bake good. Staff very attentive and helpful... love the environment and decor... not to mention a very delicious strong cup  of joe... great surprises for eastern brunch..."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after hearing good things, and we were not disappointed. My fish and chips were crisp and tasty, and my wife said that her burger was the best she's ever had. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"*not vegetarian/vegan friendly**rude/unhelpful staff* I was really excited to try this place, a nice breakfast/brunch place near my home that's not an egg works branch but I was greatly disappointed in the service (he was a young man in his early 20s with blonde hair and of short stature). My mom and I came in for breakfast around 9am and the place had about 2 tables that were filled(expected because it is still quite new). The waiter brought us our menus and I realized there weren't any vegetarian or vegan options (I'm a vegetarian) so I opted to ask the waiter what my choices were and he told me \"a salad\" and that tone in his voice was so rude and insincere. In the end (without his help) I opted for a fruit bowl and hash browns. Now, when my hash browns came out they came out black (literally, both sides were black and burnt) and when I brought this to the waiters attention he played off the burnt hash brown saying \"hash browns are like this\" (????? At this point it's clear he obviously eats from the dumpster) so I asked if I could have it browned instead & the second time they came perfect. NOW, this waiter at this point knows I'm a vegetarian but he didn't think to tell me that the hash browns were cooked with butter... I took a bite of the hash browns and ~butter explosion~. The owner did come to check up on us once and he seems like he genuinely wants this place to flourish and the food is decent BUT TRAIN YOUR WAITSTAFF THEY ARE THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my wife and I's favorite breakfast stop for the weekends. Favorite items: Sunrise Sammy (croissant sandwich) and Vegas Style Avocado toast is to die for. Coupled with fresh squeezed orange juice. The owner has imported some special Turkish blend breakfast coffee which is absolutely delicious. Chill music and atmosphere, Staff is friendly, especially Irma in the front!"}
{"text":"My friend's brought me here as a brunch deal thing on groupon- and I remember that this used to be a Norm's breakfast place, with a weird wet hot rag smell. Well guess what? It was still hot (I peeked and the thermostat read 78 degrees,) and it still smelled like wet rag! The pastries didn't look too appetizing so I passed on that, but I did order their brunch special of salmon wrapped lettuce with mushrooms and other crap that didn't seem to go together. I must say, the best part of my meal was  the poached egg that was done perfectly and the whiff of air when we left. I saw my friends burger and he did not finish it, so I assumed it wasn't worth $13 as I know he is a cheap guy. The pancakes were pretty mediocre too, with some fancy coconut dressing. This place is not as great as it appears to be and I wish the owners do something about that smell! The other best thing about this place was their coffee, it was smooth and subtle. Like how coffee should be. Kudos on that."}
{"text":"Let's paint a picture...just under 30minutes to spare before one of only like 2 breakfast places in the area are getting ready to close. I saw a picture of the pancakes and read a review about how great the food was. I was so excited. As I walked into the restaurant at 3:08pm, I was barely greeted with one of the servers kinda of under her breath saying they were closed. The restaurant advertised online and on the front door to close at 3:30pm with 2 tables still dining but the CLOSED sign flipped on the door. The server asked the cook if he wanted to turn on the grill (which means they must have shut down early and cleaned it to not want to turn it back on; someone was ready to get out of work early today)   Fortunately, with all that is available in the area, I will never return to this place just on the laissez-fair attitude they have. How over-the-top could this place be if the ethic of the place is to shut down whenever they feel like it.   Good luck.   For those that read this, just a friendly reminder that just around the corner Mimosas Gourmet is scheduled to open until 4pm. Friendly & professional service. Check my next review for the upcoming food from them"}
{"text":"Awaome breafast and lunch menu with an island infusion. Food is amazing fresh from scratch, and the service is spot on. Try the bread pudding with the island sauce you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Just ok. Used a Groupon. Wasn't thrilled.        Maybe I just wasn't a fan of the flavors."}
{"text":"We just finished a late breakfast here at Dirty Fork and it was really good. Both of us loved our dishes. Croissant egg and bacon sammie and Belgium waffle."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now. I can tell they put a lot of effort into making the atmosphere pleasant. The food has been pretty good.  Bacon is very tasty and scrambled eggs are well seasoned.  French toast and pancakes are well made and dressed.    As a personal preference, I wish they would put cheese inside their omelette not on top.  Also, I wish they offered iced tea every day instead of just weekends. They did offer to brew me some, which was very nice.  I can understand that there isn't really a demand for it.   Staff has been very friendly and accommodating.  I will keep going back.    Based on previous reviews, it looks like they take feedback seriously and are constantly striving for improvement. I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for Brunch. We ordered the following: hippie kale salad, avocado toast, lunch special, fresh Oj's & side order hash browns. I would say the best was the hash browns they were perfectly well done with onions. All the other items tasted very bland not much flavor. I was amazed that there was only 1 Chef cooking for the entire restaurant he got everything out within 15-20mins for us! I wouldn't really crave anything at this place I may or may not be back because nothing really wowed me.  All in all this place was good."}
{"text":"This place is very good the food is awesome the service is awesome i like it that they have many selections breakfast lunch and dinner i will be back to try more of there food they also have vegan options"}
{"text":"My husband had previously eaten here sitting at the counter on a weekday morning.  Was satisfied with the quality of the food and the service. He enjoyed watching the cooks in the kitchen perform their cooking skills. We decided to both go on Sunday and sat at a table.  There were about 5 tables looking at the menu and only one waitress.  My husband remarked that the cooks were not the same as when he was there. We ordered a fruit plate that was just about so-so.  My husband ordered 2 eggs with hash browns, sausage with whole wheat toast.  My husband felt it did not compare to his first visit in taste and quality.  I ordered the omelet with hash browns and rye toast. I could not believe the amount of salt they used.  I could not eat the hash browns and only tasted the omelet.  I gave some to my husband who isn't as particular as I am to over salting foods. So my breakfast consisted of one slice of rye bread.  The waitress asked when she brought the check if everything was okay. I told her about the salt problem and she said she would let the cooks know. So not a good experience . I purchased a groupon we will return on a weekday only and be careful on what we order.  The bill with tip and no drinks was 35.00."}
{"text":"Talk about nice little breakfast/brunch spot off the strip. I always wanted to check out Dirty Fork because honest the name does peak one interest. More so close to the house for me and always looking for new spots nearby. My first impression was talk about REALLY really nice interior decor. I know the place before was also breakfast/lunch spot but am sure not as nice. The display case with the fresh pastries is on point! The different pastries all looked hell of tasty just had no room for any once realize the size of the 9th island french toast. Three different areas in the restaurant. The bar area once walk in that had all these different cool light fixtures hanging down, the main dining area, and in the back little booth area that has really cool framed artwork hanging on the wall. The whole Dirty Fork name and big Fork on another wall. I like the personality in it. They do have some outdoor patio available.   9th island French Toast was screaming at me for first visit. I know just cause from 808. Really when reading the description the key was \"Hawaiian Sweet Bread\". It something that not see often on menus in general. Who would have thought basic French Toast concept but use Hawaiian Sweet Bread. Brilliant! Not only the Toast but add the guava cream cheese and coconut syrup went tropical island style. I added fresh fruit (Strawberries and Blueberries) not only more filling but balances out all the flavors. Talk about nice portion size if carbs is the game you get your money worth on this one. lol. It was winnah!  I also ordered fresh orange juice. The only reason mention it is that they squeeze juice everyday. You can tell the difference. Super refreshing and perfect drink with my breakfast.   The service was five stars. The waiter told him first time explaining everything checking up  making sure everything was great. The owner is awesome. I love seeing small business owners out in the dining room asking for feedback on the food. Honest. Friendly. Grateful. Genuine. Someone that not only has passion for the food but cares about customers.   The prices are very reasonable. If looking for great spot start the day Dirty Fork is great spot! Or if any your plans involves Desert Breeze Park head across the street for food later."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place I could grab lunch with my puppy today.  Saw the tables outside and thought I'd give it a try! So happy I did!  The servers were nice enough to bring me a menu as I sat outside with my pup.  Honestly all the options sounded so good, it was difficult to choose.      The server KJ brought out a carafe of water, which tasted great! Not that vegas water flavor that I usually decline to drink.  I also started with a glass of orange juice, only because it is fresh! I usually dislike OJ, the one they've got here is delicious and frothy.    Burger with avocado and fries- Really exceeded my expectations. The bread reminds me of something from shake shack. So good! It's probably the first time I did not need to add any ranch.  The avocado was saucy enough on its own that the burger needed nothing extra.  The fries!! Such a nice crunch on the outside, super good all by itself. I can't think of where I've had this texture of fries before. Definitely stands out from other places.    Lunch special- took a bite from my girlfriend's plate. If you are looking for something light it's a great option!   It has salmon, arugula, mushrooms, pico de gallo, with a poached egg the yolk just oozing.  You can tell the thought they put into this menu.  Everything is so yummy!  I thought I'd have a super quick and casual lunch. I surprising enjoyed my afternoon here and decided to stay a little longer.   KJ told me about their afternoon tea offering.  Which I can't wait to try next time!  I didn't have much space so I opted for a cup of tea and macaroons. They were just the right amount of sweet to finish off my meal.   I'm looking forward to making this my social spot.  Afternoon tea is already on my schedule!"}
{"text":"Dirty Fork!!!!    \"Just Amaizing\" Best cozy place in town. Brought the hole family over and had a special moment. Every detail was perfect. I highly recomend this brunch for everybody that want to spend some quality time. Food delicious, place very clean, service excellent, good jazz music, very relaxing, without forgeting the fresh pastries. I don't know what's up with people writing bad reviews. We loved it."}
{"text":"Is this place French? Am I crazy? Dirty Fork doesn't sound like a french name but the vibes are definitely french, not to mention the menu has items that have clearly french names. It's just that the name \"Dirty Fork\" didn't make me think \"french bistro.\" Which also means that I was not prepared for the higher than average pricing. I ordered a Paris Panini and it was good but nothing special. I replaced the salad with hashbrowns and those were bomb! They cook them with onion and I didn't even need ketchup to enjoy them. My boyfriend got the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special. He liked it but I didn't even try it because I really was not in the mood for chicken.  I think the shock of thinking it would be something it wasn't turned off my boyfriend from it, but I will certainly come back. I enjoyed my time and learning about what this place offers. The portions are  smaller than other comparable restaurants but I thought it was perfect sizing. It was enough to eat everything and feel full but not so much that I felt sick or had to take some home. I was particularly impressed by their coffee! I am by no means a coffee snob, I can be equally satisfied by 7/11 brew as LavAzza but this was smooth and perfect even without creamer.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just bought a groupon, and tried this place for the first time. It's right down the street from me, great location. The decor is perfect, great ambiance, service was wonderful, and the food was amazing! We ordered the Dirty Fork breakfast special and the Angus burger. The chicken on the special was awesome, the burger was seasoned perfectly, fries were so good, and for me the biggest surprise were the eggs. I don't eat other people's eggs very often, but these were seasoned well, and tasted amazing. Also, the fresh squeezed orange juice was sweet and delicious, some of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to come and have brunch! It's is full of flavor and variety and I will always recommend the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special (my favorite) I also loved the sunshine Sammy, very good and savory. The whole menu is just phenomenal and I always enjoy coming here :)"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and was not impressed. They had no ice for the drinks cause the machine was broken. The service was poor and the food was bot better. Figured we would end it with dessert to save the meal. BAD idea!! Brownie was hard and did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Well before I start, let me say that with great fortune, I am able to dine at so many of the Michelin star places on a regular places from Rubicon in Paris to Il mullno in Manhattan to Providence in Los Angeles and so many in Vegas including Nobu, Gordon Ramsey ( EWWW) , Giada, Alize', SW, Guy savoy and on and on . It is also out of necessity cause my lovely wife do not like the sight of a cook top, I was told it causes a rash of some sort and I believe it as it puts her in a odd mood all day when she does enter the room called kitchen! She saw this place one day and suggest we go there and give it a try as that is our hobby living in Vegas to try any place we have not been before at home or when we travel. Sometimes it is a fantastic surprise and sometimes it is a disaster. The chef/owner came and introduce himself and told us he was at the Wynn for 10 years and that sets me up to have high expectations. I am pleased to say, it does not disappoints as the room is cute and pleasant with a nice park view, parking is abundant and the food is great! Fruit is fresh and the croissant is as good as any in Paris, all the little things are done right, the egg in my croissant is slightly browned and portions are good for humans but not gluttons so don't expect a feeding trough but a civilized portion! Tomato soup is note worthy, perfect balance of flavor and texture, it is common to be over salted and this one is not. Coffee is good and hot and the dessert which we took home was a very nice surprise for a breakfast place, is it as good as Angelina  in Paris? Certainly not as elaborate but for what they do make, comparable and that is a high praise if you ever been to Angelina in Paris. In finally, we will be back with friends and I honestly do think one thing they can do and that is to raise the price a little, for what they serve, they deserve a few more dollars, that is what I think of this place, enough said."}
{"text":"Not worth an almost 50 dollar bill for two people here. Came in the restaurant with a few occupancy yet it took awhile to get our food which consisted of a panini/salad and the dirty fork special. Ordered the 5 dollar fresh squeezed oj, it was the only thing that actually tasted good. Definitely will not order again because it came in such a tiny glass. Left unimpressed and wishing I ate somewhere else....."}
{"text":"A great find on my short trip to Vegas!  The scene is open, bright. Mid day during the week, no reservation required. We were there for lunch. Party of 8.   The menu is fun with a pretty wide range of choices including sandwiches, salads, bowls, wraps but also charcuterí and bruschetta.   Service was pleasant and quick.   VEGAS STYLE AVOCADO TOAST $11.50 The dish was meant to be made with smoked salmon which was not available and was substituted with Prosciutto. A bit of a disappointment but the dish was still fantastic. Fresh greens and Prosciutto piled on avocado toast and topped off with a glorious poached egg..   The coffee was fresh and delicious!   Other dishes had by our party looked equally yummy and were reported to be excellent. No one in this crowd would hesitate to return!  This is a great stop for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Waited almost 40 minutes for our food and never got utensils for my meal. So you're telling me within that 40 minutes of waiting, a server couldn't bring my friend and I utensils? Ok. But the chef was nice enough to give us free macaroons, however it didn't make it up because we waited so long. Food was alright, I feel like it's overpriced for what it is. I might return in the future when the business is more established since it's new and things still need to be improved."}
{"text":"Just went here for the 2nd time with my girlfriend. Awesome spot! The food both times has been perfect! Sat outside on the patio today and enjoyed the weather. Will definitely be coming back more!"}
{"text":"We just had an deliciuos lunch at Dirty Fork!  My wife and I shared the Bruschetta.  You get to pick three choices from a wide range of options.  We decided on the brie with apple and fig spread, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, and prosciutto and marcaspone.  Everyone of those choices were very tasty.  We also split the petit bruerre pannini, grilled chicken.  Again, awesome meal!  The freshly squeezed orange juice was the best and after lunch we shared a connoli which was on point (crispy shell!) and I had a cappuccino.  Excellent all the way around!!!  We will return on our next trip to Vegas.  I definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here today with family. Owner and staff very friendly and food was excellent. Service was a little slow but owner said, \" good things take time\". We will definitely return"}
{"text":"The Dirty Fork is twice the price of other local breakfast eateries.  They work hard at making the food look pretty and American but the taste is just off.     Go down the street to Norms and get a better breakfast at one half the price by people that speak English and have a very clean kitchen."}
{"text":"DIRTY FORK IS A GEM... GREAT FOOD..... Great coffee in a stout mug I had the sweet hawaiian french toast with fruit...just EXCELLENT Also the hash browns with onions are flavorful and fresh The fish and chips are excellent...done just right.... Portions are outstanding I would highly recommend the dirty fork....look forward to more visits"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this cafe. The atmosphere is so relaxed and along with the calming music.  KJ our server was great. He was very polite and approachable.  The Vegas Avocado toast is my favorite dish here.  If you need a quiet place for breakfast to start your day off right come to this venue. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I JUST HAD THE PERFECT BURGER!!!!! First off, the menu is amazing, so different from the basic breakfast places I've been to. So I decide on a burger with avocado and grilled onions:) It comes on a perfectly toasted sesame seed bun, when I bite down juice is drippin on the plate, the bacon was so tasty, and it had thousand island dressing AND cheese!!!! I've had burgers where there is more bun than burger so I trim off the sides, NOT this one, every bite was a perfect bite with plenty of avocado and all the fixins!! Not to mention the fries!!! They were perfect as well!! My meal here was not only a meal, it was an experience!! You can tell they care about quality at this place! Definitely worth a shot and I know I am for sure coming back because I'm leaving soo happy"}
{"text":"Wow!! Had avocado salmon toast............. Bomb! Also the 9th island French toast. Also delicious. Very fresh ingredients. Organic produce. And very friendly staff. The chef came out to check on us. I would come back as well as recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"very GOOD! I'm not one to rave about a restaurant. But the Dirty Fork deserves the accolades  of a 5 star experience. Fresh, cooked or prepared to perfection. Large portions. First visit and will definitely return. Happened upon The Dirty Fork when we stopped there to eat at a previous restaurant that used to reside at the same location and had moved. Decided to give The Dirty Fork a try and so glad we did. While you may think upon initially looking at the menu that the prices are a bit high, fear not, as you'll get more than your monies worth in quantity and excellent quality. As the four of us shared our food from our plates, when have you ever done that at breakfast, we noticed other diners eating there at the same time we were sharing their food with each other too. :-)  currently there's a Groupon, so get it while you can."}
{"text":"When a place has great food and awesome employees, I usually give 5 stars but this time I can only give 4 due to the delivery and estimated delivery time! Our food was almost an hour later than expected. Needless to say, our food was amazing! We got the panini and the fatty burrito breakfast! The delivery driver was super nice and vouched that the food was delicious and was very apologetic that it took so long but it was worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"1.) Staff is rude, unfriendly, unapologetic, NO HOSPITALITY  -didn't welcome us when we arrived  -didn't introduce himself  when we sat down, just asked if we were ready to order 2.) Forgot the bacon in the \"Sunrise Sammie\"  -didn't apologize for for getting it  3.) Saw a table of 4 that was seated when we walked in, they didn't get their food till after we finished eating. 4.) Saw a worker in the kitchen pull out his phone multiple times  5.) Eggs were HORRIBLE (not an understatement, it tasted like airline food)  6.) Didn't check on us once when we got our food    ONE WORD... TRASH"}
{"text":"I'm just moving into the neighborhood and thought I'd check this place out. It surprised me it was so good! The food was above par, the service was wicked friendly, and it's adorable. And the view of the park is nice. Good pastries, fresh squeezed juice! And macarons! Omg I want to come every day!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have really enjoyed the service, ambiance, and quality of items. The first time my boyfriend and I had the dirty fork lunch special and the dirty fork breakfast special. Both were fresh and the different flavors and textures compliment each other so well! They have Turkish coffee which is ! Everything left us feeling light but full. Not in an overwhelming way I which you want to nap or anything. We came again this morning and decided to get lunch. We got the fancy turkey sammy and the dirty fork burger. The turkey sandwich was amazing. It has pesto, avocado, onion, sprouts, and a super delicious sauce. I got fries as the side and they were a perfect type of crispy. The dirty fork was huge but also amazing. I don't even know what else to say besides amazing."}
{"text":"In my book, the company EAT 24 is mostly at fault.  But when you use a third party to deliver your food, the experience should be somewhat carried over.  Now I never ate here before. And i still haven't.  I ordered my food today at 1pm for delivery.  The app EAT 24 said the food would be picked up and out for delivery 10-30 min after food was ready.  My food was not delivered until 4pm.  By then i had to go to work and get food elsewhere.   It was quite upsetting.  When the food finally came, the delivery guy made it seem like because my roommate received the food 3 hours later all was forgiven.  I ordered food with enough time to have it prepped, delivered, and eaten. The food arrived inedible, old, and soggy. My roomie ended up receiving 3 hour old breakfast burritos and pancakes that were held in a sweat box of a person's car, who has no business doing deliveries.   Just because you have a car and a license doesn't mean you are qualified to deliver food or drive in a city you don't know well.  And because of this person's careless and disrespectful ways.  I am harshly reviewing EAT 24 and the Dirty Fork.  If you choose to have people deliver your food, better have them know the area. I spent 24$ plus tip and received a headache, and no food before work and i had to settle on fast food instead. By the time i could follow up.  We were promised 30% off but a full refund is what i am asking for from someone."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the Dirty Fork Breakfast special. The strawberries were fresh, the chicken, the eggs, and the French toast were all phenomenal. There was only one person servicing us. She was overwhelmed and could not handle us all. She needed help. But based on the food alone it was great. Service could be better, but I will be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and thing the food tastes great. Service is okay but not great because my food always comes back wrong. We say something but eat what we get so we don't waste it. This place is good but very expensive for what you get. I don't recommend eating here unless you have a Groupon."}
{"text":"Tried to go here for breakfast this morning since it's been bookmarked on Yelp for a few months now!  I'm not sure what her name was but she was very unprofessional and rude.  They had a specials menu, I decided to order the loco moco and sub fried rice for the $2 upcharge as stated on the menu.  She very rudely told me that I can not substitute fried rice and that it was a way bigger charge.  I showed her the menu and specifically where it said $2 upcharge for fried rice.  She continued to argue with me so I walked out without having breakfast. Friday November 3rd, 2017 9:30am"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on Wednesday morning.  \"What a diamond in the ruff\".  Clean, friendly and amazing food.  I'm so glad I went the few extra miles to try this out. It was so worth it!. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in venturing out to this quinky little restaurant. They only do  breakfast and lunch. There's a large variety to choose from on the menu.  I had the French toast. It was absolutely delicious.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for lunch after she received a DM on instagram from someone at Dirty Fork asking for us to come try the food (and offered a discount). My mom was interested after seeing their Instagram photos so we came in. As soon as we walked in, we weren't acknowledged at all and were standing awkwardly behind a table of seated guests. Two employees looked at us but said nothing; one of them even walked right in front of us but still said nothing.   Finally, we were acknowledged by someone at the cash register. She said it would be a few minutes until we were seated. There were only a handful of tables taken so we were confused as to why we had to wait when there were so many tables that weren't taken. Turns out, no one thought it'd be a good idea to clear and clean the tables after patrons left. Literally every table was still full of used plates and cups! Then one of the employees tried seating us at one of these tables when I noticed there was a table literally right next to the door that was clean so we told her we'd rather sit there than at a dirty table. She sat us down and then walked away. We didn't even get to place our drink order for almost 5 minutes because she took so long to come back to us.  After we were finally able to place our food and drink order, we got our drinks pretty quickly (I mean, it was a latte and orange juice). I was a bit confused because she placed our drinks down and left without asking if I wanted sugar (which is typical since some people like to put sugar in their lattes). I took a sip anyway and it was SWEET. I like my lattes sweet so I enjoyed it but for those who prefer a latte, well, to taste like a latte, this is not what you'd expect. I think they should have removed the sweetness factor and give patrons the option to sweeten it to their preference because not everyone expects their lattes to come pre-sweetened. Or, they should have asked if I wanted it pre-sweetened or not.   Our meals didn't create any sparks, so nothing to particularly rave about. We weren't happy with the lack of cleanliness and desire to clean up the tables after being used, the extremely slow and lackluster customer service, and food that didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps it was an off day, but the three things I just mentioned shouldn't happen anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome blueberry pancakes (though they could use more berries and perhaps some fresh whipped cream) and \"Vegas style\" avocado toast with lox and capers! Coming back with the girlfriend next time I'm in town. Congrats on opening!"}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure to expect from this place when I saw the name and then the chic-style updates the did from the prior restaurant that was in the same spot. I was pleasantly surprised to see an eclectic breakfast/lunch menu that includes both some gourmet touches mixed with a good balance of more traditional food options.   Deciding on the 9th Island French Toast, I was looking forward to a delicious experience. While good, the french toast fell short of expectations. It was not remotely as sweet or sumptuous as I would expect from standard french toast at any other breakfast place. The fruit offered at an additional cost was also nothing significant, though aesthetically on point, and was essentially room temperature. Particularly for the price ($13.75 with The fruit add), I certainly expected something more memorable. I also was not offered a glass or ice for my can of diet coke. Seems strange, but not a huge issue for me.   All that being said, the food was decent and I will definitely return to try some of the other intriguing items on the menu to see if I better connect with a different item. The service itself was fast and the food was attractively plated. A gentleman, who I assume is the owner or at least manager, did stop by after my meal to check on me. He seemed concerned with the flavor, which makes me wonder if they have had complaints. I will say that I did not raise my concern at that time because overall everything was decent and they may intentionally be trying to downplay the sweetness of the dish. He also requested a review if I used Yelp, which is always a positive sign for a brand new restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation to get away from the buffets; such a delicious brunch. Healthy and fresh, clean eats. Highly recommend  great service as well, the chef himself checks in on customers to be sure they are enjoying the meal!"}
{"text":"This place was a joke on the wait time when we went there. It was only two of us and we waited almost 2 hours for 2 simplest dishes. Food was ok, nothing special to have waited that long. Will not go back for it."}
{"text":"We were the only customers and services was slow. The menu options for breakfast is limited. Not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"This place was great, good service, very nice Staff, quiet atmosphere, I ordered Belgian waffles with strawberries and turkey bacon amazing!!!! But the only thing I wasn't to please about was that I found a bug on my plate under the waffles. Not sure how he got There but he underneath so idk if he was on the plate or in the strawberries but wasn't too happy about that, and I ate inside. Other than that it was an okay birthday breakfast minus the random bug ."}
{"text":"DIRTY FORK, CLEAN PLATE! Just finished eating here and it was delicious as always. I've had the What the Fork Omelette with veggie sausage the first time and it was amazing, this time I had the Vegas Style Avocado Toast and it was equally as incredible. I like that this food is focused on healthy options of delicious food. You gotta try Dirty Fork, and don't forget to tip your chef!  this is not a computer generated review."}
{"text":"Stopped by after going to the park. Had the pancake full stack with lilikoi with a side of turkey bacon. Very good. Service was great"}
{"text":"Went here after months of driving by and looking at the menu online. It's around the corner from me so finally decided to stop by on a random day off. I was really excited to try the Dirty Fork Lunch Special with the prosciutto wrapped arugula which is what I have been seeing on the YELP menu and the Eat 24 menu but when I got there they had changed it to salmon. I didn't even notice the change on their menu and proceeded to show the Yelp and Eat 24 menu to everyone working there because after months of anticipation I was disappointed. Well much to my surprise they brought me a complimentary plate of prosciutto to make up for the confusion. Apparently they changed their menu but Yelp and Eat 24 hadn't had updated it yet. I admit I was a tad bit dramatic about the issue but I take my food seriously lol. The Lunch Special was amazing both ways. Salmon and prosciutto. I loved the decorations and waiter was very good. I'll definitely be back to try the French toast and pancakes! Don't understand the negative reviews. The restaurant was charming and everyone was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good eats and a good bang for your buck, definitely give Dirty Fork a shot. American, French & Turkish inspired dishes that will knock your socks off. Staff & owner are very personable, attentive to detail & kind. Be sure to come with an appetite"}
{"text":"Don't think I'll be back to this place we waited 25 min (timed it after 5 min of no one coming to get our drink order ) to have our order taken. To only find out that they use butter when they cook. They are on Groupon btw."}
{"text":"Food and service were fantastic, and the owner took the time to check on all the customers! Portion size was just enough for my smallish appetite which was good because I don't like taking breakfast leftovers home.  I thought the prices were a bit expensive, but the quality of the cooking as well as the very attentive server do make up for it.  Eating out for breakfast tends to be an occasional treat for me, but I would certainly go back to this place and try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting....dirty, horrible service and the food is nothing to be wild about.....can't wait for it to turn over with people that know what they are doing"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, there was only one server on shift, but she still provided us with prompt, lovely service! Amazing food, the dirty fork lunch special was my favorite, all the food arrived steaming and fresh as anything. The chef even checked in on us multiple times to ascertain we were satisfied with our meals. 10/10 would recommend!! We will be returning"}
{"text":"Friendly quaint restaurant. Service was excellent and food even better. My daughters and I enjoyed breakfast menu items consisting of the Ms Lorraine quiche and scrambled eggs with bacon and cheddar on a croissant. Very tasty!!! I will be a repeat diner"}
{"text":"I was REALLY looking forward to dining at The Dirty Fork. 3 girlfriends and I decided to meet here for our monthly breakfast date. We had a groupon to use and were excited when we looked at the menu.   We arrived when there was only two other tables occupied so it was lovely and quiet. The server greeted us but immediately seemed frazzled just getting us water.   My 3 year old son tagged along as well and I asked for an orange juice for him, to which she replied, \"Well that will be a little while because I have to squeeze it and everything.\" Okkkkk....was she trying to convince me not to get it? Then I said, \"Ok, do you have kids sizes? It's just for my little guy.\" She started walking away and said, \"No we have one size. It's five dollars so, it doesn't matter who orders it.\"   Then came the ordering of other drinks. She came back and asked what we'd like. I told her I was fine with water. My friend across from me asked for orange juice, which she again told us it would be a bit since she had to squeeze it. Then my other friend ordered an iced coffee (which is on the menu), to which the server responded, \"We don't have cappuccino or anything, we're basically out of everything today. We didn't get our delivery.\" My friend told her, \"That's fine I just wanted regular iced coffee.\" She said, \"Ok I don't have beans or anything.\" So my friend said, \"So do you have coffee?\" and the server said, \"Yeah I can make regular iced coffee.\" ........?!?!?!?!?!?!?? Then my next friend asked for a latte....oh brother, the server was clearly pissed now. She said, \"I don't have stuff for lattes. Do you just want water?\" My friend said, \"What are your assorted teas?\" (Listed that way on the menu) and the server said, \"We have green tea and English breakfast.\" My friend told her she'd have English breakfast with lemon, and the server said, \"Not honey? Usually it comes with honey.\"   Ok, moving on to food. We ordered and had no issues ordering the food, all of which was fantastic. The saving grace of this place was the food was fantastic.   Now it's time to pay. I thought her head might explode. We told her about the Groupon in the beginning but she brought the check without taking it off, so my friend said, \"Oh you forgot the Groupon\" and she said, \"Oh well you know you shouldve reminded me.\"  She then looked at the paper printout my friend brought and said, \"Can't you pull it up on your phone so i can redeem it immediately? Otherwise we have to send it in and it's a big pain for him.\" (\"Him\" being the owner, i presume?) My friend tried to pull it up but was not getting service in the restaurant so the server (tapping her fingers on the table) said, \"Ugh I'll just take this. I just don't want it to kick back to him that it doesn't work.\" Then she took it and came back with the adjusted check and we handed her our credit cards asking her to split it 4 ways evenly. She said, \"Oh I cant Split the check or the Groupon won't work.\" I said, \"Oh we're not splitting it, we're just paying with multiple forms of payment. That shouldn't matter.\" She said, \"No I can't. You'll have to pay for it with one form of payment.\" As a former waitress, I was floored by her behavior and terrible service up to this point but this response was laughable. Finally I decided to just pay for it and we had to get it figured out how much each owed and how to Venmo it. All while my newborn was screaming.   Time to go. We said goodbye to each other and as I went to grab my son, the server snatched the paybook off the table which caused my keys to fall. As I'm holding my car seat in my arm and my sons hand with my other arm, she didn't even pick them up.   Bottom line, as a diner, I don't care one bit what you're out of or why, what inconvenience you might incur because of a coupon program YOU participated in, the fact that you only have ONE server and by the time we left there were 8 tables of people, or the mood of said server because she's dealing with all these issues.   They say you come for the food but you come back for the service. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE. For $5 per glass of juice, and $12.50 for 2 tiny Nutella crepes with one spoonful of whipped cream, you better be kissing my ass, and this was a joke."}
{"text":"very cute little place. decent service. got the avocado toast with lox plus poached egg. very delicious. $12 affordable. only issue was it was far away from the strip. but id say check it out"}
{"text":"so where do I begin? ok let me take a breath!  anyways, the dump we went to is called dirty fork??? you serious? who in their right mind associates the word \"DIRTY\" to a restaurant??  maybe cause who ever runs it like this old lady keeps dogs in the restaurant.  the place looks so cheap, so badly put together obviously immatures used clear tape to put this dump together  forget the guy with the long hair in the kitchen picking he's nose and teeth but the idiotic server lady just watching him and not even reacting to he's nose and teeth picking, of course they didn't realize we where watching them.  Our food came and of course we didn't touch it, much less pay, we wanted to let management know but supposedly there was no manager on duty, a few minutes later this old lady with some horrible lip piercing acting like a manager or something try to talk to us but my friend ignored her and so did I as soon as I realized she was the old lady with the dogs in the kitchen!!!!!!   hell no, this place should be shut down or be investigated, never the F*** again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, the place was clean and bright.  Our server was very friendly.  Why 3 stars?  It is overpriced. $67 for 2 adults and 2 kids.  They don't have a kids' menu.."}
{"text":"Great food. Natural Organic fare. I'm a red meat eating regular guy, and the Dirty fork burger was perfectly juicy and delicious. Nothing but good things to say all around the table. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast or lunch. And they have great pastries as well!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. The food doesn't taste any better than something I can cook at home...and I'm not a great cook. It's pricey here and not that great."}
{"text":"To start off the staff is really nice and accommodating however the food leaves something to be desired. I've been there 3 times and all 3 times I've been not only disappointed with the food but appalled by the price. I feel that they are a little expensive. One time I ordered the Belgium waffle which was more like an eggo waffle, bacon, eggs and coffee and I think I paid almost $20. Just now I went and got a bagel and cream cheese and I was not informed that the bagel would have homemade dill cream cheese and when I returned it the chef seemed a little perturbed and took almost 10 minutes to give me the bagel with plain cream cheese. Like I said they are over priced for the quality of food that they are putting out."}
{"text":"This place is so good and flavorful, Turkish Hawaiian food. The waffle was very pretty and nice and fluffy with a generous amount of whipped cream. Definitely going back for lunch, can't wait. The veggie wrap super tasty fresh ingredients awesome amount of avocado, dressing was tangy and sweet. And we can't forget about the hash browns what ever he seasoned them with was on point, a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Another car repair brought us into Dirty Fork.  This time I was able to meet the owner Fatih.  Also this time I tried something else: the breakfast special.  Completely enjoyed the meals I've consumed here so far.  Still love the interior of this place.    High tens to the new server.  He's still learning.  (You'll get it quick.)  Gave us huge smiles when we asked for honey and we got the gigantic bottle.    Highly recommend the breakfast special for salmon lovers.  Oh and the black coffee!  What is it?!  Nice robust and aromatic!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite local breakfast place!! Discovered this lil jewel a couple of months ago!!  I have frequented once a week since!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Lox Bagel through delivery on UberEats. I am a bit disappointed because by time it got to me, the bagel and toppings were a bit soggy which made it a little less enjoyable. In general, I am suggesting for future deliveries that it would be beneficial for any spreads or smears to be served on the side. Plus garnishes like tomatoes be served on the side because that also makes it a bit soggy.   I did enjoy the latte that was delivered. It was still hot and delicious.   I know delivery is a bit different but I can definitely see myself going in for the Hawaiian fusion food!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday. I had the \"Vegas Avocado toast\". It had lots of reviews on yelp so I gave it a try. I enjoyed it. If you are looking for a light breakfast or lunch item it is a good choice. It is just enough food to fill you up. My friend had the \"Im Easy\" with vegan sausage. I tried her sausage and it was my favorite part food item I had there. They also gave a Hawaiian style breakfast menu. I will give that a try next time. I do think the place needs more decorations on the inside. The ambiance is major reason why I like to eat out.  I will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Omg ! The best breakfast I had. avacado salmon toast was amazing. The ingredients very quality and fresh. I came with my wife for her birthday. And she love it she  appreciate it to  me. We will come back soon  for sure ."}
{"text":"Wow! 5 stars, eh? Not quite. First, we ordered two dishes. Blueberry Pancakes and the house special (french toast with eggs and fried chicken on top). Five minutes after we ordered the server notified us that they were out of blueberries. That isn't what killed it for me. Upon receiving the \"special,\" I immediately wondered where the chicken was. Oh, there it is. It was 2 oz of finely diced frozen, processed chicken strips. Let me remind you that this dish costs $13. The owner/chef came to our table twice to make sure everything was ok. The second time I attempted to explain to him that I was disappointed they had used frozen, processed chicken. He explained that they couldn't use fresh chicken because it wouldn't be crispy. Wow!! Well, Sir, I invite you to go to any place in Vegas and try something called CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!! You will certainly be served a hand breaded piece of actual chicken. One more place crossed off the list... shame shame"}
{"text":"My sister found this place got good reviews & since there was a Groupon for this place we decided to try it.  It was a cute well decorated place.  The staff was very friendly & made ypu feel welcomed.  The baked goods displayed looked yummy.  They had a nice selection for Brunch items & 9th Island (Hawaiian) menu.  Being Hawaiian it was nice to see that.  I ordered their 9th Island french toast.  Which was yummy made with sweet bread & topped w/fresh fruit serves with tropical butter & syrup.  We also ordered the 9th Island fried rice (which had spam).  It was all yummy & fresh.  I would definitely try this place again.  FYI ot is a bit of a drive from the strip."}
{"text":"This place was a new for my wife and I. First time trying it. We went around 10:30 am. There was only 1 waitress and a cook. The waitress was awesome. She sat us done brought us water and took our order. Was perfect. On the other hand . I order my steak medium. But it came out well done. She offered to take it back. But I said no cause I was so hungry. She told the cook. But he argue with her that it was medium. He is wrong. The cook needs a lot more training. I'm giving you 3 stars. Cause it's not fair to have only one person running your whole place. Get it together. The owners of this place."}
{"text":"Opening of door pleasant enough, clean and amicable surroundings, sat quickly by friendly staff (irma) and same as our waitress .....pictures are sadly better than the food itself breakfast special was overdone eggs and french toast waffle was good.  The tuna croissant  was too hard to palate, I can pass on any future visits  here as I have not yet turned into the millennial that likes to overspend just quite yet...."}
{"text":"We just tried the angus burger and it was the best we have had in a long time. We had it split in two and the chef and server went above and beyond to customize our request for a split dish. The french fries were amazing. We definitely will be back. Also try the almond croissant."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing breakfast the food was so bomb! I got the vegas avocado toast literally everything i want for a breakfast. It was so pretty too. The salmon was perfect a really good amount of avocado. The eggs were perfect just yolky and cooked to perfection can't wait to come back the only reason of the 4 star was the waitress was just really awkward."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious. We tried the Sammy and the Ms Lorraine quiche with side of hashbrowns. The orange juice was the best in town and organic. The owner and chef was also very nice to come greet us. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Good place and food is delicious, clean, cozy, the service is amazing, the food in time and rich, I love this restaurant and the name I like,Dirty Fork"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but I was very disappointed with the results.  I stopped by around 1pm with a friend. I had already looked up the menu and Yelp reviews prior to arriving. The place was empty except for people at a few of the two top tables by the windows. We ended up sitting at one of the bigger tables for 4 in the middle. The restaurant was warm. I'm cold natured so I'm figuring it was over 80° in there for me to even notice. All of the tables have the same kind of chairs, hard wooden with decorative designs on the back. They obviously don't want anyone hanging around. My back was killing me after just over an hour in these chairs.   We sat at the table for about 4 minutes before the cook came to give us menus (the waiter was focused on the few couples at the tables on the wall & cleaning dirty tables). The waiter came and took our drink order. I ordered a diet soda. It came in a can with a glass of ice that was melted into half water when presented to me. My friend received water no ice, no straw (she never asked for no ice and wanted a straw). We decided on what to order, a few minutes later we placed our order. I ordered a short stack of pancakes with coconut syrup. My friend ordered 2 scrambled eggs and a bagel(btw- they charge $1 extra for cream cheese on the bagel). While placing our order someone came in to sit at the counter. We waited and waited and waited for our food.  The guy at the counter got his food, ate, and left before we were served even though we ordered first. The cook was walking around, hanging out at the register, and certainly in no rush. It was about 30/40 minutes before we got our food. Finally the cook brings over our food. He drops it off with no silverware. We see him speaking to the waiter at the end of the counter (no customers/no register there, he was doing something by himself). The cook begins rolling some silverware. He brings it back to us 3 minutes after dropping off the food.  I was very disappointed that my item was not was described on the menu. Instead of coconut syrup on the pancakes, it had shredded coconut (which I don't like) and regular maple syrup. Either they are out of the coconut syrup (& didn't mention it) or their menu is written incorrectly. I didn't even feel like trying to get it corrected because it took so long to get this. I ate about a 1/4 of one pancake after scraping off the shredded coconut.   I asked for the check. The waiter brought it and took my debit card. After 10 minutes I had to ask for my card back.  He didn't have it in his hands and I was getting concerned that I saw him return one to someone that gave theirs a couple minutes after I gave mine. He was confused that he hasn't given it back and went looking for it. He returned it to me a couple of minutes later. I wasted $20 on 2 scrambled eggs, a bagel (no cream cheese), a canned soda, & 2 inedible pancakes.  TLDR: This place is over hyped. The service is incompetent in the afternoon. The menu doesn't match what you get. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here the other day and the food was really good! Seated & greeted right away, no reservation required, just the 2 of us. I got the egg sandwich & my boyfriend got the omelette. Good quality food, good size portions, decently priced, nice ambience & nice presentation. Service was good, very friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated, it's another Hawaiian business bolstering the city's claim as the \"9th island.\" The restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Norm's Eggs Cafe. They've done a great job making the interior more inviting with darker woods and turquoise paint to give it more of an island feel. There's a decent sized dining area and also a counter you can sit at that looks into the kitchen.   Their menu isn't very focused. There's some Hawaiian inspired fare that seems to be the main attractions and also shows the most creativity. Then there's some French and American dishes thrown in, along with a breakfast burrito. So, it's a hodgepodge of breakfast and lunch stuff that's probably good for their bottom line, but doesn't really show what they're about or where they want to take this restaurant.  On my first visit, shortly after they opened, I only grabbed a couple pastries. At the time they were outsourcing their pastries and the product was poor with the chocolate croissant soggy and limp and the almond croissant tasting like it was days old.  A second, more recent visit, showed much improvement. First, a thick, biscuit-like scone to start. Followed by their 9th Island French toast. Using a sweet Hawaiian bread, it's more like a dessert, but if you like sweets, you'll love this dish, especially when it's drenched in coconut syrup and guava cream cheese.  This place shows some promise but will have to re-focus their menu and improve their pastries."}
{"text":"We have been back several times and the food is still fresh and delish. I saw someone post that people giving good reviews must be related to the owner lol nope just satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Came here looking to try a new breakfast spot. We had to wait a little long for the food due to a larger party but once the food came I was super impressed. Presentation was wonderful and the food was so savory. Your taste buds will love it. Quite little place on the corner but super cute and delicious."}
{"text":"This is actually my second time here. I came when they first opened and the food was okay but not to die for and come back again. The prices were a bit more on the expensive then other breakfast places I've been to. The first time when I was here, the food came our really slow and the service was...slow and inattentive. The chef and the serve both came out to say sorry and that they just opened.   Second time, I came with girl friend since I saw there was a Groupon special. I wanted my Eggs Benedict that I had last time and the server let me know the menu has changed due to a change of owners. Well, basically everything REALLY changed because the food wasn't as good and the service was even worst then the last time I was here. We ordered a kale salad since my friend saw a picture of it and it came out completely different with mixed green salad and just a few pieces of baby kale. My friend also ordered orange juice and a cranberry juice for her and her daughter. The juice cups were the size of a kids meal cup and charging $3 for cranberry and $4 for OJ.  Needless to say, I will not be returning...."}
{"text":"Super cute little place. We ordered the spam musubi, ninth island French toast, avocado toast with poached eggs, macaroni salad, and broke da mouth burger. The spam musubi was delicious with the addition of olive oil and herbs. The guava cream cheese and coconut syrup were the perfect addition to the French toast. Avocado toast came loaded with greens, pico de gallo, and smoke salmon, it was a prefect light breakfast. The burger was huge and smothered in gravy, perfectly cooked. Mac salad was like a kicked up version of traditional Hawaiian Mac salad. The server was friendly and attentive. Looking forward to coming back and trying the afternoon tea"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited on a Sunday morning. The restaurant was cute and clean. Our server was friendly and the owner came out to ask how everything was. The food was made well and the only complaint we had is that the bread wasn't toasted. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fabulous. The staff was warm and welcoming. The menu had so many options with a yummy twist on certain dishes. The Hawaiian sweet bread french toast with guava cream cheese and coconut syrup was amazing. I will definitely make a point to eat here again next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Breakfast with a little Hawaiian flare. My two favorite dishes here (so far) are the 9th island French toast and the Vegas style avocado toast. Add extra fruit to the French toast and it really doesn't need any syrup added to it. After eating the avocado toast, I leave full, but not weighed down.   Love the small, family owned businesses because you can feel the love and pride from the owners. They are eager to satisfy your appetite!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast last Sunday. The food was amazing. I got the 9th Island French Toast and he got the Dirty Fork yumminess chicken French toast strawberry thing. Coffee was very good. Orange juice fresh squeezed. A bit of a bummer they don't have mimosas or bloody Marys. The reason for the low stars is I ordered 3 chocolate croissants to go. They were pricey but my kids love them. They were so stale my kids took one bite and tossed them. I even took a bite before the toss and it was not good. Stick with the fresh made food here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food gets 4 stars for me. It's a good solid breakfast and different from the many breakfast spots in Vegas, but really nothing special in comparison to the incredible brunch spots Los Angeles has to offer. I would say the uniqueness is on the higher end of the Las Vegas scale but dead center average on a Los Angeles scale.  The thing that stood out the most about this restaurant is the timing. It took quite some time to get our order in (15 min), 30 min from the time of ordering to get our coffees, an additional 15 min to get our food (45 min from the time of ordering), then an additional 5 min to get our silverware to actually enjoy the food sitting in front of us.    The problem with this restaurant is not lack of staff, but rather lack of organization and structure. Breakfast is not a hard meal to prepare and is rather quick. Maybe they don't have their routine in place or methods of handling a full restaurant but something needs to change in this restaurant.  At this point, although the food was good, I do not think I'll be coming in for a sit down meal anytime soon."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast and lunch spot on the West side of town. My most recent visit was during a 3 hour wait time at the DMV down the road and decided to use Yelp to try out a new place to eat at since I had so much time before the DMV would call me up. Dirty Fork was previously bookmarked in my profile but I left it in my bookmarked section for awhile and remember seeing a few delicious looking posts from various Yelpers.   Upon arrival, I was greeted by Maggie and was seated promptly and given a Menu. She was quite knowledgeable of what is offered. It took me some time to decide what I wanted but I ended up with an order of the 9th Island French Toast with fresh fruits. When it arrived, I was like, \"Aloha!\" It was so big and filing. The actual Toast is made with Hawaiian Sweet Bread and was paired well with the Guava Cream Cheese. Every bite was scrumptious and mouth watering. I would come back for this if I wanted to an order of carb overload, lol. Great to share with someone or needing a delicious cheat day. Kudos to Jose, the cook for the Day. I wanted to try a few items but they were out of certain ingredienta so I was quite bum. However, I will come back to try more of their delicious food and if im feeling home sick.

{"text":"First time here at Dirty Fork, I got the Fatty Burrito. It came w/a side of salsa fresca & some seasonal fruit. Overall it was alright, nothing that I'd say \"omg I need to go back for it!\". I do appreciate how they have outdoor seating to accommodate pets. Probably bc there's the dog park right down the road. Nice little brunch place, I'll definitely order something else next time."}
{"text":"The bakery items were excellent. Varied menu. The iced tea was delicious a special Turkish blend.  My husband really enjoyed the burger. Fries were delicious, seasoned and cooked perfect. My omelette was fluffy and delicious. The only hitch I see is after all of the quality fresh ingredient they use, both the burger and omelette had processed cheese. The Chef owner assured us it was a mistake. Chef was proud of 80% of the ingredients being organic and he bakes everything fresh. Soft opening and he wasn't cooking. Training new cook. We will go back, but I will be sure to let them know, no processed cheese."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. My panini sandwich was so very delicious and mty guest had the hawaian french toast and it was also amazing. The owner checked in with us and truly cares about the quality and service. I highly recommend this establishment and if you have any wait at all it is 100% worth it! Thank you Dirty Fork!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning and as always the food and service is great.  Maggi was attentive and very sweet, Jose cooked our food and it was delicious.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quiche, one of the BEST ever!  The tossed greens instead of potatoes was very fresh.  I look forward to returning for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Take this from a former server!!! Server was extremely friendly. Other than that, not impressed at all. Food was mediocre at best. Turkey Sammy was made without sprouts(check the menu), we weren't given side options, just French fries, and the dirty fork breakfast was disappointing. There was hardly any chicken on it, and the chicken was all breading anyways! French toast wasn't crispy, I cut through it like it was butter. Not to mention the prices are ridiculous for what you get. They will try to sell you higher because they use \"some\" better ingredients then most places, but the quality doesn't add up. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't think it would be possible to get better than this. Phenomenal food, generous portions, impeccable plating, off-the-charts customer service, gorgeous coffee and a reasonable price point.   I've eaten here twice, and will be back many more times. When you're at the Dirty Fork, you feel like family. Do yourself a favor and get the hot coffee - it's not your typical diner coffee. A turkish roast with phenomenal mouth-feel, each sip is a buttery treat for your taste buds.   The avocado toast will BLOW YOU AWAY with smoked salmon, fresh fruit, greek yogurt, sunflower seeds and the most perfectly poached eggs I've ever encountered. I didn't want this meal to end.   The french toast is a feast, I took half of mine home! French toasted Hawaiian sweet bread topped with scrambled eggs, chicken tender nuggets, fresh sweet strawberries, and fresh whipped cream. Holy moly.   My husband says the burger was one of the best in Vegas, and the fatty burrito was bomb.com - his words, not mine.   I'm super stoked the Dirty Fork followed me on Instagram one day (rocksteady81) because after cruising through their feed, we headed immediately down to check them out :)"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. The atmosphere is cozy and urban and the food was AMAZING. I ordered the Dirty Fork Lunch Special and was not diappointed at all. This was the best lunch I have had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"So yummy, everything was well prepared and just as I had ordered it. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Got the avocado toast and spam Musubi. So good. And the portions big. Full after my meal. The plates are delicately and beautiful plated. And the atmosphere has a tropical feel to it. Great place to spend Sunday breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Totally worth the drive off the strip. The food, owner and quality is awesome. If I lived here this would be my official breakfast spot. Why wait in lines, overpay and not get great food on the strip!"}
{"text":"Amazing service food was delicious!!!! The owner was very nice & always checking on us. Beautiful restaurant"}
{"text":"3 star only because Food was delicious. But service as far as service I would have given no stars...it was horrible. I waited at least 15 mins before even getting ask what I would like to drink. Then I had to wait another 15 mins before drinks came out. What upset me was 1. The place wasn't too busy. Maybe 3/4 tables tops. 2. How is it that I've been waiting to be served for the last half hr and the table next to me gets served first? 3. I guess I was served short on one of my plates. Half way through my meal the waitress comes out with a side dish and says \"here's an extra side dish because we shorted you on your plate\". Seriously?!?! Again food was great but service was horrible"}
{"text":"NO \"Aloha Spirit\" in this establishment whatsoever.... I will never return!  1) Walking in, no one greeted us. Not even a smile nothing, it took awhile for someone to notice, it was not until we were about to walk out they acknowledged us. Service sucks! Especially Fatih, the misogynistic fool aka manager.  2) The chicken panini's bread tasted stale & literally had only 3 small strips of chicken. 3) Hawaiian French toast was sad. The \"guava cream cheese\" literally was a teaspoon of flavorless junk. Bread tasted like it was re-microwaved & the fruit tasted overripe, overall totally dissatisfied with the food. .... totally dissatisfied, with absolutely everything the food & service, took one bite & we were done and decided to pack the food To Go .  .... we returned from our car to find out they did not give us the coconut syrup rather they gave us regular syrup.. so we requested for some coconut syrup.. here's where it becomes good. This arrogant, chunky, misogynistic fool starts yelling at us, saying that he's the manager/cook FATIH & that he did in fact place coconut syrup in our order. There was another worker in the back that told him that he in fact put maple & basically told him to shut up. At this point, we were heated, he literally started YELLING at us basically saying he's right & we are wrong. Now, we are just disgruntled & kindly asked for a refund, & returned the food. Now this misogynistic fool, FATIH starts yelling & saying NO REFUND (like an angry bulldog) & that only the owner can approve it. After arguing, his pettiness, on a business card, writes a note with the amount of the toast for \"store credit\". Now, I ask him for a # to call the owner... he gives me the same # on his card. Turns out the customer outside told us that him & his wife owns the place & and that customer ended up leaving as well.   As someone who's entire family is from Hawaii, this has place NO aloha spirit whatsoever. Worst customer service EVER."}
{"text":"This place is beyond cute and adorable. Upon entrance it almost seemingly appears that you are no longer in vegas. The aesthetic & decorum of the entire place was very alluring, although the service - not so much....   My friend and I entered the store around 1:02, we got seated and waited. It took about 10 mins for the someone to realize we did not have any menus and have been waiting for someone to come help us. We our waters a couple minutes later and order our food within 20 mins of arrival. It was extremely busy during the time we went. My friend and I literally waited almost an hour afterwards for our food (which I have no complaints about). There was only TWO chefs working and cooking all the food for everyone and it took extremely long. I was certainly not expecting to wait so long for average tasting food. This was such a hinderance on my time.   Not only that but my other friend order an acai bowl and it literally came out like soup!! with barely any fruit or granola or anything to mask the horrid taste. For $11.50 it was certainly not worth every penny. Although I do thank management for giving her extra honey, extra granola, and extra fruit - because girl let me tell you that acai bowl was well very bland.   I will most likely not come again. It was a very cute restaurant with a lot of potential, although they definitely need to work on time management and hire some more chefs!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here for brunch after I saw so many delicious pictures on social media  So we couldn't resist since we love exploring Vegas's favorite local spots.   I got their avocado toast (I can't go anywhere without trying any place's avo toast for some reason) & a 9th Island French Toast which were both delicious. The avocado was only 1 slice of wheat toast with a lot of greens, 2 poached eggs & the avocado spread of course. You can get it with smoked salmon & cream cheese if you'd like as well. The French toast was 3 slices of sweet Hawaiian bread with fruit & very yummy coconut syrup.   My SO got a side of bacon, hash browns, & 2 eggs & a Take Me to Belgian Waffles with fruit & he expected more than just 1 Belgian waffle..   We both got coffee & everything tasted great. But we didn't expect our brunch bill to come out to almost $60.. for it to fill our stomachs contently. I recommend to not order sides to prevent it from being costly.   Come to Dirty Fork, the taste & presentation is absolutely amazing! So if you're willing to spend a little more out of pocket to try everything, it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Good presentation was great! The food came out in a timely manner and was hot. I would come back"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the owner seems to genuinely care that you enjoy your experience here. Will definitely be back with my family!"}
{"text":"Food has nice presentation and was served quickly! They have a nice diverse Hawaiian style menu but the taste was average."}
{"text":"Horrible experience . I messaged the owner prior to writing this review and they didn't even bother to apologize for the bad experience at their restaurant. So here I am spilling the truth about this place based on my own experience. I bought a groupon for this place and was excited to try a new hip neighborhood eatery so I came there with my family one morning. We stood up at the door waiting for a waiter or a host but after waiting a good 7 minutes, we tried to get one of the waiter to help us but they were too busy running around serving others. Tables were dirty, this place is understaffed. We then decided to take a long table by the door but a mean looking lady at the cashier just yelled at us and said \"give us a moment\". A moment? We've been standing infront of her for now about 15 minutes and that's the respond we'll get? And still no waiter or waitress attending us. The excitement went out the window when we waited for so long for service so we got up and we all left to go to another breakfast joint.   Like I said I messaged this place on Instagram messaging hoping to be able to help improve their service but I was ignored. ( made me feel like I was on the wrong for giving my concern) No reply, no apology, no thank you for letting us know either.  If I can do a zero star that's well deserved for this place!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas! Wonderful atmosphere (which is always my favorite). Maggie (4th day on the job) did wonderfully in service. Prompt and courteous staff. GREAT COFFEE AND FOOD!! It is worth the trip to dine and enjoy the quaint, but amazingly wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Two items on the menu they didn't have and cooked French toast wrong??? Really who messes that up?"}
{"text":"Try getting seated rudely then getting served the north shore special out of half a ROTTEN PINEAPPLE. Which makes up the actual thing you're eating out of. Then when we complained to the cook, he argued that \"yes it's rotten but it's only the pineapple\" BEING FROM HAWAII I know the quality of service and food that islanders possess. This place is Shame and thrown together. No pride in the service or food they dish out. My whole family felt a bad vibe from the staff and WONT be returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Food is soooo unique and not at all expensive for what you get! We had the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the North Shore Special and both were amazing! Marco and Jose were the chefs and our waitress was Maggi. Service was good, place is cute and we had leftovers! Only downside for todays visit no Musabi for the hubby and they do not redeem Groupons on the weekends. However, because I checked in on Yelp they gave me a free soda! Sodas are in cans by the way and that is how I prefer them to be served! That way you always know they are carbonated! We will be back and will tell all our friends!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! I wanted to try something new and I saw this place a few days ago when I was driving by and then noticed they were offering a Groupon. My friend who's recently moved to Vegas found an apartment and I said we should celebrate so I took him to Brunch after he had signed his lease. I had the Dirty Fork Lunch Special which was delicious and came with fresh fruit. I actually ate the whole thing which is a rarity for me I'm usually one of those people with eyes too big for ones stomach who ends up eating several bites and takes the rest home. The owner (James? I'm apologize if you're reading this I'm horrible with remembering names) was what made my experience a 5 star one. He was friendly and sociable he must've chatted with me and my friend for 10 or so minutes and I really dig that about a place when the owner makes time for you to engage in friendly conversation. I will definitely be a returning customer. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we won't be back. Two of three times we've dined here, the service has been horrendous. The menu here is awesome, so my family of four gave it another whirl, but our most recent visit was absolutely awful. A table that arrived after us (another group of four) were seated, served, presented their check, paid their bill and left before we got our food. They sent food out for 3 of 4 people at the table with no explanation on the missing plate, which we had to wait another 15 minutes for. Of the three meals that came out, all three were wrong- one set of poached eggs were undercooked and tasted strongly of vinegar, another meal was doused in sauce we ordered it without, and blueberry pancakes were raw in the center and oozed batter when we cut into them. The waitress, who was very apologetic and moderately embarrassed, returned the bad meals to the kitchen. While waiting for the second round of food, the manager came over and we shared what was happening, asking about the still missing fourth meal. She apologized and offered a free dessert, which we declined. About ten minutes later, we got new pancakes (which were good), and replacements for the other two meals. Of these, one set of poached eggs was over cooked (completely hard). The fourth meal was still missing at this point, and my son was nearly in tears. His food showed up another 5-10 minutes later, and by now we were ready to just leave. The waitress checked on us again, and was sympathetic when we asked for our bill so we could go. Shockingly, after all this, the manager didn't remove or reduce any charges on the $70 check. Unbelievably disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast we had this morning!  The 9th Island French Toast was heavenly and the What The Fork Omelette was so fresh and delicious. The owner is just as delightful and great staff!  I definitely will return soon and try out more items on the menu and in the pastry case!!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS. I had the avocado toast with salmon on top, and my BFF had the French toast dish with strawberries and fried chicken on top...holy moly! And if you like fresh, their orange juice is straight from the orange. I'd never had it that fresh before! Cute decor, friendly staff, and yummmmmmyy food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! Portions were just right. The restaurant is clean and bright. Bakery items looked wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, short stack pancakes for me and omelette for spouse. Have to say the food was outstanding.  Might be the best restaurant pancakes I ever had.  And the omelette was excellent came with organic salad and avocado.  Didn't see potatoes on the menu for any item but lots of healthy food here. Service is wonderful and they serve purified ice water which tasted fantastic compared to what I get at other eateries. Also the fresh squeezed orange juice, while a bit pricey, was absolutely delicious.   Lots of organic food offerings, can't be beat for that.  Will return."}
{"text":"This was just a small little breakfast place. Nothing that really grabs your attention but I really enjoyed that you could sit at the little bar and see your food being cooked. It looked really clean and the food was tasty. Service was on top of it but there was only a few people in the cafe. Menu seemed limited but I guess pick one thing and do it right?"}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast! The best French toast I've ever had. Topped with the freshest fruits and an amazing coconut syrup(to die for). The avocado toast was perfect with salmon and poached egg on top. 10/10"}
{"text":"Food was sooo  yummy!! Service was amazing & the owner such a friendly guy!! The french toast with fresh fruits to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and quick service, beautiful atmosphere. Don't be tricked by the name as it was sparkling clean. I had the dirty fork burger which was HUGE and delicious. My girlfriend had the dirty fork breakfast special- French toast with scrambled eggs, fruit and fried chicken on top. Both were excellent. Will definitely be returning very soon."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I came to dirty fork I have never been here before I want to give a shout out to Irma she is the host and the server she did an excellent job she was able to recommend a few items off of the lunch and breakfast menu   also I want to give a shout out to the chef who did a fabulous job I actually went with the in  humongous juicy burger special sauce, cheese veggies and a fat bun thank you thank you thank you I will recommend and I will be there again  #PersianPrincess"}
{"text":"We tried this place this morning. The interior is attractive, and they also have outdoor seating. The food is really fresh, and a lot of the dishes are organic. They have vegetarian options, too. It's not the typical greasy breakfast fare. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I first found Dirty Fork on Instagram with their fabulous photos. Once I saw they are walking distance in my own neighborhood I knew they were a definite future dining experience. I'm happy to say we weren't disappointed! I got the Ms. Lorraine and my son got the Sunrise Sammy. Both were delicious! The service was fantastic, the restaurant was clean and has a pleasant atmosphere. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Delivery-  I ordered the Vegas Style Avocado Toast. It looked amazing, but the edges of the toast were so hard I nearly chipped a tooth. Plus, the avocado was far from ripe- very hard and not tasty. The lox, eggs, and greens were great, and the coffee was actually really delicious.   Left me wondering if the meal would have been better in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food.  Not typical breakfast fare.  Cute place with cheery aymosphere.  I will be bacj!"}
{"text":"Ok so, this place.... went in it was full House. Cute decor and we were seated right away. We were really excited about the looks of the Menu. As we sat there waiting for our order to be taken we watched beautiful dish after dish being served. Dish after dish after dish after dish after dish after dish.... no one came to take even our drink order. Finally, a bus boy brought us water. Then again we watched dish after dish.... finally about 30 minuets later our order was taken. Best fresh squeezed orange juice! But after 45 minuets later.... after the mad rush of 17 soccer players were long gone, and a second glass of the best orange juice had been delivered (hoped it was on the house at this point) we continued to watch dish after dish after dish being served to others. The Chef came to apologize. We then continued to wait. We almost walked out and then my dish came. I felt bad to eat because my boyfriend did not get his. Mine looked good ish. It was their signature breakfast. Way too expensive for that dish. We had a Groupon so I splurged to get it. Finally, my boyfriend got his food. But, for as long as we waited and the waitress said it was not her fault and out of her hands.... then why the hell did my boyfriend have to get up to get ketchup. I mean you had an hour and a half to bring us ketchup for the fries that was ordered. Chef came back with a piece of bread pudding as a good Will Offering. We checked out. My second juice was not charged and they did not let us use the Groupon for it was a weekend. We had check in on yelp but did not get to have the free soda. What a fucking waist of time and money. I gave them 3 stars, because I know they will reach out to me and offer to give me a $100 gift card to their place and show me how they could do better then today and earn five stars. I have faith in them."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, truly enjoy it come here often to get their breakfast both me and my girl love it. The fatty burrito is awesome. Also have some pretty good pastries and well, have a different variation of a bread pudding which is good.  Downsides, can be a bit pricey. The coffee is mediocre at best usually don't get it unless I haven't had any yet and need some. The orders do take awhile if they get busy to come out which I think is due to the one chef.   So this was bad awhile go but not up and down. So originally they had some pretty terrible servers but seems like they have hired some new ones which are better, but depending on who's there that day serving can be a bit slow to refill drinks and check on you."}
{"text":"Got a flyer on my car and stopped in for breakfast. The Fatty Burrito was delish...couldn't eat the other half.  The coffee was devine as well as the bottled water served...Ambiance was very nice with pleasant and attentive server & wait staff.  Will come again and bring friends. Reminded me of The Village in NYC..."}
{"text":"The food is great. The coffee is delicious, service was great.  It's a hidden breakfast"}
{"text":"Great new brunch place! The food, service and environment were excellent! I love that they offer vegetarian and organic options! Very friendly staff. The owner is also the Chef. He visited each table to ensure everything was good and offered us free coffee on our next visit! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing..Great food, great prices and great people and such a wonderful place!! I definitely will be back next time I am in Vegas!! thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem with Dad! What a great little spot for breakfast or lunch.  Great service and delicious food. I had the avocado toast with salmon which was delicious. Dad had the steak and eggs and LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and saw the good reviews today...   so for lunch we went.   I had the dirty fork special....mmmmmmm.   the salmon was spot on!    I even tried the desserts...    a litl mini raspberry pie.   Really good stuff."}
{"text":"Service was good, we were the only customers when we went. Food was good, cute inside. Diner with a modern healthy twist feel. Not a huge selection but they had items that catered to vegans and some items that catered to Hawaii locals which is right up my ally!. Worth a shot if your a breakfast junkie like us :)"}
{"text":"Came by today for breakfast with the fam, I saw that they had Hawaiian style breakfast, so I figured we should come and try it. It's also pretty pricey for such small portions.  I ordered my son a fruit cup with a butter croissant. I don't mind paying $5 for a fruit cup as long as the quality of the fruit is worth it, in this case it definitely wasn't. Fruit was soggy and didn't seem so fresh. The croissant wasn't that great either. I would've rather had a croissant from Starbucks.   I had the Hawaiian style fried rice (I think that's what it was called) for about $11, and I was expecting a huge portion for that price. But no, it was small and the rice was kind of hard. Didn't care for it. The mac salad was also unusual, I didn't like it either. We also got the Loco Moco, which was kind of bland.   The service was HORRIBLE. We had a good start when we came in, there was a guy with glasses, he was nice. But nobody came to refill our coffees, til we asked. If we didn't ask, I'm pretty sure nobody would've came. Nobody came to check on us to see how we were doing, literally not even once. I made my boyfriend go up and pay for our meal because I knew nobody was gonna come to ask us if we wanted the check. The man with the black shirt that showed his stomach hanging out and the beard, dropped off our food and he did not look happy to be there lol. I was watching him interact with the table sitting in front of us and he looked like he hated his job, I thought it was pretty funny that he had such a crappy attitude.   Needless to say, we left a really bad tip. And I probably won't ever come back. The only thing I really cared for was the coffee."}
{"text":"Yummy! I had the Vegas avocado toast.......so good and healthy. Will be back as I don't find many breakfast places I enjoy here in vegas."}
{"text":"Place is absolutely amazing! Pure perfection at its very core. Place has the best coffee in town!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast with my daughter this morning. The food and the service was fantastic. Jodi was a pleasure. Looking forward to going back next week for my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Dirty Fork for breakfast. Dirty Fork for lunch. Other Mama for dinner. Repeat."}
{"text":"We had 6 different breakfasts. All were tasty, plenty of food.  I had the LaRainne. Delicious quiche. Pastry light and flakey. The service was exceptional. We haven't been together for a few years. We sat and visited for two hours. Staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"What an amazing hidden gem! Dirty Fork opened in February 2017 and apparently I live under a rock. I brought my mom for breakfast and we were both very impressed from the moment we walked in. Great menu choices and the quality and presentation of food is wonderful. Will definitely return. This is a place that would do well in Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"I was craving food from home and looked up Hawaiian food. Looking for rice during breakfast can be tricky in Vegas. I took a chance on this place and I'm so glad I did. Had their loco moco.... and was more than satisfied. Ask for extra gravy!   Their oj was so yummy too"}
{"text":"The name is Dirty Fork, so I checked to be on the safe side and found the silverware to be clean.  My wife and I both went with the 9th Island French toast (Hawaiian sweet bread w/guava cream cheese and coconut syrup) and upgraded to include mixed fruit.  It was different and certainly tasty, but I thought menu prices were a bit unreasonable so it is not a restaurant I would frequent on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have had in a long time. First time I went I found them through groupon. Went on a Monday because the group on clearly states that it is not valid on Saturday and Sundays. The lady would not take it because it was Memorial day. It did not say anywhere on the fine print of it not being valid on holidays. We still stayed since we were already there and the tables around us were still dirty from their previous rush our. The server took a long time to take our order and we were the only ones in there at the time. I order a coffee and she brought that almost at the same time she brought the food out. Food tastes great. It was the service I was disappointed with. Second time I manage to go was on a Tuesday got there a little before 3 and the place was already closed. The sign outside said it closes at 3:30 PM. Will not go again. Unfollowed them from social media. I will just let the groupon go to waste."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place- my hubby and I are foodies so new places are always great to try. Service was extremely slow, I was never asked for a refill on my coffee and our food took about 40 minutes to come out. We were in on a Saturday morning but there was no wait and it seemed pretty slow inside, tables never filled to capacity. Our order took about 15 minutes to be taken after sitting down. Food was meh, nothing great nothing extremely poor. After we finished, I took the kids to the car while my husband waited to pay the bill. We waited another 15 minutes before he was dropped the check. Overall, I am sad to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem with delicious healthy food. Been there twice in one week! I want to try everything on their menu ! The service was great, the workers are pleasant . Their food consists of breakfast , lunch and some Hawaiian dishes ! They also have a bakery display with yummy looking croissants, danishes, etc. The whole atmosphere is welcoming, with some good jazz music playing in the background. It's a very chill spot. I will definitely come again to try the rest of their menu !"}
{"text":"This place is just a average breakfast, lunch place. It tries to be fancy with its food dishes, but it's not. Food is skimpy, boring and over priced. Don't waste your time or your money at this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place to come brunch, the prices are amazing and the food is worth it. They are very decorative and tasty . Its the place you want to take a group of friends to spend a few hours. Amazing service as well"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast and brunch spot! They have a lot of island themed dishes, as well as some French options. I tried the Ms. Madame. It was similar to the French croque madame with a few twists. The egg on top was cooked perfectly. It had a Swiss cheese instead of the traditional white sauce. There was also Dijon mustard which gave it a nice tang. The micro green salad included was fresh, with a multitude of dressing options. The island pancakes were fluffy and light. I tried their house made guava syrup, and it was excellent! It was light and sweet. Also there was a side menu which included some other dishes, like Loco Moco. I did try the Portuguese sausage that was on that menu. They definitely need to add that to their regular menu. It had a great texture that was soft and the meat was fresh and seasoned well. I definitely recommend coming here for a great breakfast that is upscale from your standard diner!"}
{"text":"Originally I came to eat at norms egg cafe Little did I know, norms wasn't there. Instead I found the dirty fork, at first glance it looked super fancy inside, but really they just cleaned up well and chose an exquisite color scheme, along with their decorative lights, and their succulents chilling in a vase on each table. I ask for a menu before I sit down, the menu had much to offer, I was honestly quite surprised, I was expecting to see overpriced classic breakfast dishes, like $15 for your typical pancakes sausage eggs and bacon this was not the case here. The menu consisted of what one would say \"exotic\" dishes. Lox on toast, Hawaiian bread toast with coconut syrup and guava or passion fruit cream cheese! They had this dish called the madame which is what I got, it was a surplus amount of ham and cheese, a spread of some mustard, and more Swiss cheese oozed on top of the sandwich and then finished with an Egg over easy as the cherry on top! The taste was absolutely indescribable, my partner had ordered the jade toast with the guava cream cheese, and I almost couldn't tell if this was breakfast or dessert for breakfast executed with perfection. The presentation, really made it difficult to want to desecrate such a beautiful piece of work. The best part was that it's all organic food, I'm sick of all these lard factories we call breakfast diners. If there's any place you want to treat someone to for breakfast, or just eat right, it's here."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic, I had the breakfast special. The OJ was fresh squeezed and delicious. She had the burger and fries.  The avocado and  the sauce on the burger was perfect"}
{"text":"Where do I begin...My friends and I decided to check it out and I was disappointed. Not only did our food come out after 45 minutes but my order didn't come out until they were done eating. Then, only half of my order was completed. For a restaurant that relies on word of mouth advertising, they need to get this customer service part down. Both the waiter and Manager did tell us how they only had two cooks and stated the next time I come in, I can get a free cup of coffee. The food was good but they have a long way to go. I don't think I'll be grabbing that cup of coffee anytime soon."}
{"text":"I honestly hate writing negative reviews.  I came here when they first opened with my boyfriend & got the Vegas style toast which was good (obviously multigrain toast, avocado, smoked salmon how could you go wrong?). The only thing I didn't care for was the yogurt on the bottom on the plate but NBD  We then went a second time & I decided to get the Dirty Fork Lunch Special without pico de gallo and replaced the bread to multigrain.  Absolutely loved it.     3rd time I went was with a girlfriend & I got the same Dirty Fork Lunch Special with my alterations.  The 4th and last time I went.  I had my boyfriend order since he arrived before me and I told him the vegas toast with no pico de gallo and multigrain toast.  But I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special & mixed it up.  So I received the Vegas style toast no pico de gallo (it doesn't originally have pico)  I'm aware that the order wasn't correct (honest mistake) but I do feel like the waitress should've known that the Vegas toast didn't have pico de gallo and maybe clarified that that was the correct order if she knowingly knew the Vegas toast had no pico.  When I tried to tell her I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special she said \"no problem let me try to alter it\".  THEN shortly came back and said she couldn't alter it and they would make the correct one.  THEN she came back again and told me I would get charged for both plates.    It's disappointing when you go to a business when they first open & then they start to be \"cheap\" & not accommodate.  The owner has even recognized me the first 3 times prior.  I liked going here because the food was decent and close by to work.  They're over priced for the amount of food you get, I won't be coming back.  Take care of your customers & customer service determines if people will come back.  Which from the looks of it you guys have lost a few people from your service."}
{"text":"My fork wasn't even dirty??? 0/10  Service was quick and friendly. The food was decent, I got the Dirty Fork Omelette which was smothered in oregano.  (the pumpkin macaroon and tiramisu was really good!)  They leave jugs of water at the table which is adorable. The afternoon tea set was super cute. The food itself was mediocre. I wouldn't return for brunch or breakfast but I would definitely come back for the pastries! 100"}
{"text":"Food was good but service took awhile to get served and checked out!   Has the 9th island French toast!! It's was awesome! Spam Masubi Rice was dry."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery and was excited b/c most places do not offer veggie sausage.  I ordered hard boiled eggs ---- I received poached I ordered waffles ---- I received a very soggy gross mess. (Even McDonalds puts the butter and syrup on the side).  I am giving two stars for veggie sausage and coffee. I do regret spending almost $15 on food I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"This is a cute clean little place. The avocado toast is good and filling. The service is slow. We had to wait 20 minutes when we sat down for someone to take our order."}
{"text":"This place has THEE best food. Everything they make they take their time on to make it look and taste incredibly amazing. I'm so happy I said yes to coming here for breakfast this morning. Also the customer service was amazing. We got checked up on many times during my visit. Nonetheless, the place is very clean and well taken care of. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've drove past this place a million times and finally was able to check it out. I got the 9th isl and french toast.. n it was amazing! Thick, buff pieces if french toast wuth the cocinut dyrup n guava cream!!!  it hit the spot.  So good.  Atmosphere is welcoming, clean, and in a odd way very homie. Ill be back for more goodies!!"}
{"text":"Really cute place! Great ambiance and relaxing music, nice selection of food. Service a bit slow...over 5 minutes wait for our waters. I've worked in hospitality a long time, and especially in Vegas, I take customer service very seriously. Otherwise delicious spot to go to here and there that's away from the strip. What local doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"The food was delicious however the HAIR in my food wasn't appetizing. I brought it to the attention of the chef and the server, by the way the chef was the owner and he refused to replace or refund my order. Completely unprofessional. I would have given this place a four stars on any other day because the food was pretty decent. The service was actually good as well. What killed it was the attitude of the owner who is a very hairy man and when I showed him the hair in my food he kind of brushed it off like he didn't know where it came from.  Sorry but I can't condone behavior like that! I. Now I understand why this place was on Groupon. There wasn't a soul in there! I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place was hands down amazing.  It's so good, I couldn't wait to write this review.  Irma was our server, and she was very kind.  The coffee, to start was the best drip coffee I've had in awhile.  The food was fresh. And the vibes were amazing.  I loved every part of this"}
{"text":"Omg! So in love with this cute me local breakfast spot in the Southwest! I follow them on IG but I had not been in yet. Today, I wanted to have a solo breakfast to clear my mind and BOY! What a great time! I had the Las Vegas style Avocado Toast and it's short of ORGASMIC! The flavors blend so well! It's DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"Cutest little breakfast/lunch spot! I have been here several times and never had a bad meal! The pastries are delicious and always so fresh! And the service is great!! If you live around southwest area I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The hamburger had such a great flavor. The breakfast special was delicious. All dishes are large."}
{"text":"Not sure how people are giving this place a good rating other than the fact that they may be friends/family of the owner?  We ordered the dirty fork breakfast special...Hawaiian bread, scrambled eggs, and chicken (or I should say what chicken?!) on top.. it was tasteless and overpriced (for $14?!) ..the chicken seems more like a sad popcorn chicken that is pre frozen.. my husband ordered a breakfast burrito..also very sad..he had to try to season it since it was again tasteless.    Sad place.  If I didn't have a Groupon, I would've been very upset paying for breakfast that was not worth it.   * one star for a nice presentation at least .."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was good.wish they provided tea pot when tea is requested. Also not a fan of soda being served in cans. Will be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Cute lil cafe type restaurant with a great atmosphere.  Service was quick and food was tasty.  Definitely adding Dirty Fork to my breakfast go-tos!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Very clean. Loved the choice of turkey bacon to accompany my eggs. Most places do not offer that. Had the pleasure of meeting the owners too. Wonderful hospitable couple. Thanks. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place was really yummy! We had the Vegas toast and the French toast. Both were very satisfying. The owner was very kind, and the way they decorated was super cute.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was finally time to try out this place, as I tour local restaurants for brunch. We ordered their Paris panini breakfast for our entree and the 9th island French toast for dessert.  As we're waiting, I had to ask the server to refill my drink; that's a pet peeve of mine. She comes back with the French toast. I pause because I was about to remind her, but I just couldn't hold it. She responded with, \"oh, sorry. Well, it's gonna get busy, so this is better\". In disbelief of her response, I just nod and start serving myself (apparently I'm in a rush!?).  She comes back with my drink and the panini. I set aside the French toast and start with the salad. The dressing was really good. The panini was good, but nothing special. By the time I got to the French toast, it was cold. And you know how sad French toast is. Any way, I don't think I'll be having a repeat visit.  Now, if you're down for diner-like venues, like Hawaii faire, and wanna try something new, in the area? You can try it out. If you want ono Hawaiian brunch, there's always Cinnamon's."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and only one server. She had to keep apologizing because it took over  45 minutes to get our food. There were only two of us. The coffee was good and I know they were hustling behind the counter, but we waited wayyyy toooo long to get our order. I don't expect fast food, but this was ridiculous.  I'll check back on Yelp before I go back to see if they service has improved.  Oh, the food was good, except maybe because my chicken and waffles took longer, my grandson's hamburger was cold...hmmmmm sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the owner is very personable and he  really pays attention to the quality and selection of food. There is free wi-if which is always a plus and the atmosphere is relaxed.  The food always taste fresh and the coffee is A+.   I don't feel like I am going to pass out after eating here. I always feel more awake!"}
{"text":"5 stars on customer service. Very nice young lady waited on us and she was very attentive. 3 stars for the food and coffee. They only have regular coffee no lattes or other specialities. They have a better breakfast menu than some places, but they didn't have what I wanted off the menu today which was the veggie sausage- were kosher so sometimes it's easier to eat vegetarian than to eat anything with meat. So I was also disappointed to find the only quiche they have here has bacon. I got steak and eggs and so the eggs wouldn't be cooked in butter I got them poached which I was happy they had that option even. I liked how the steak was served- they sliced it so it wasn't too hard to cut into bite size pieces. My husband got the avocado toast with lox which he liked but was still hungry after eating, so he got a chocolate danish. Over all good place- they just need to up their choices for vegetarians (kosher eaters alike) and get a proper latte machine. Also they should serve a homemade dressing for their salads perhaps, just an idea most French bistros and bakeries do this. I might be back not sure."}
{"text":"Dinned here for lunch with family. We ate outside since we had our dog with us. The owner came out with a water bowl and dog treat. A nice touch after a long hike!   My dad and I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and tuna melt. My niece ordered the chicken fingers. The pesto chicken sandwich was just the right portion size and didn't have too much pesto. The ingredients in the tuna melt and pesto chicken sandwich tasted fresh.   We had friendly memorable service! We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was better. The staff was very accommodating.  Ordered the breakfast croissant and it was delicious the croissant had a nice flaky crisp. The bacon had a nice thick bite to it and was not over cooked.  The French toast was very delicious as well. It wasn't too sweet tasting and went well with the fruits  The dirty burger was alright in my opinion the burger patty was slightly over cooked."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This place is overpriced. We ordered orange juice($5) and cranberry juice($3) and the cups were the size of the McDonald's kids meal drinks. I ordered the 9th Island French Toast. The menu stated it came with coconut syrup. When my order arrived, there was not one drop of syrup. When I inquired about the syrup, the waitress told me that I could just use the regular syrup. I told her that's not what the menu stated and I would like the coconut syrup as stated. She said she would check with the back. At that time I requested the manager and all he could say that the waitress should know the menu. He did ended up complimenting us bread pudding for dessert but I was already upset with the service I was close to walking out. Btw if you purchase a Groupon, they charge you a separate tax."}
{"text":"We came here last month and was quite peeved because they were already closed at 2:30pm, when their hours were until 3:30pm. We decided to give them another try.   We were the 4th 2-person table, with 2 at the bar, and a table with 7 people. Considering that Jodi was the cashier, the server, and the busser,  hopefully people can see it for what it is, a small eatery in a cut throat industry with a small profit margin, and give some consideration to the slightly slower service. It was very slight, 20 minutes from when we were seated to when the food arrived.   Bottom line, coffee was strong, our Breakfast Special was plated nicely with a lot of food, and not expensive at all. The chicken was quite juicy, as breastmeat aren't usually.  My 9th island french toast was delicious with yummy guava cream cheese, I wished there were a little more of it. I added the fresh fruit for an additional $2, which included. Pineapple, blueberries, and strawberries. The side of hashbrowns were cooked perfectly, crispy brown on the outside."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is the only positive thing for this establishment! The presentation of the food is totally deceiving! We were there for brunch. My guests and I waited over 25mins for our food to be served. I ordered the Vegas style avocado toast! The avocado already turned semi brown when it's served. I expected the eggs were going to be runny but they turned out to be rock solid hard?! The smoked salmon was on the salty side. From that point, my appetite was already ruined! My guest ordered a dirty fork burger and requested it to be medium rare but it turned out to be medium well instead! The service was very poor. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted refill on our coffee. Let's just say the visit was a complete disaster"}
{"text":"I would not have thought of this place as \"Hawaiian inspired\", walking in but that is until you look at the menu. They're special is select style chicken and waffles. This place is good for breakfast or lunch or if you're in the mood for something sweet, they have macaroons, cheesecake, or croissants and a little more.   I came here on a Saturday morning around 8:30, no wait, no crowd. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant and unfortunately hated it, the mayonnaise (or what lever spread) inside the sandwich completely ruined the taste of the sandwich. I appreciate the organic and turkey bacon options available however. It's a little pricey overall.   My neighbors French toast looked amazing and for that I might come again. The staff was friendly and served us well."}
{"text":"It's was okay food, place was cute but not really a place I would go back to. I had bought the coupon on group on, and was told after that I couldn't use it if I got sides, but the way they told me made me feel uncomfortable. They need to put that in the fine print on group on."}
{"text":"Second time having brunch here, service was extremely slow. We were sitting there without a greet or even start us off with water for about 18minutes. Food is could be better, don't remember the food lacking in freshness or flavor from my first visit. I got spam musubi to start with and it was falling apart by just lifting it from the plate and tasted like it was old. Entrees are okay, wished it was as good as the first time I came about six months ago."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had a Groupon for this place so I had no choice but to try it out. Upon first impressions the food server was a young kid that had a piercing in his nose. I have to met that that's something I have never liked when the person serving your food has lips or nose piercings. The kid came back with a picture of water and two glasses however one of the classes had pink lipstick on it. I got a blueberry pancakes which were average but my girlfriend hated her breakfast.  In their defense the manager/owner did come up to our table and asked how our meal was. We just said it was OK because we are not the type to complain we just write an honest review on yelp and never come back again. I'm just going to say that there are many other places to eat breakfast that are much better than this one as far as service and food quality. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing on flavor and presentation.  I can't wait to go back again and again.  I want to try everything on the menu. One thing I didn't take a pic of was the fresh orange juice. This is one of my favorite breakfast places. All organic, all the flavors meshed to this amazing eatting experience."}
{"text":"I had a very yummy Acai bowl and liked to see that they had a couple of other vegan options! Worth checking out! Menu is unique and everything sounds great! I can't wait to bring my friends here."}
{"text":"We found out about this place on Groupon, and so far the service had been a little slow, we weren't acknowledged after we sat for a little bit, it seemed there was something going on behind the scenes. We ordered sunny side eggs & espresso with cream and cranberry juice,  a lox bagel and a veggie wrap. We will see how it goes!!!  The food came out, and it is delicious. I was a little hesitant when I saw the wrap but I loved it. My friend said her eggs and sausage weren't  anything to write home about, but my other friend loved his bagel. I would come back and give it a try again, but I won't be in a hurry! Just because of the service."}
{"text":"I like what I like what I like. My better half raved about Dirty Fork so we decided to do breakfast at this place. My husband is into looking up new breakfast places and trying them out, supporting local businesses instead of the big chains.   1. Seating - We wanted to sit in a 4-seater table (at least 2-3 tables available) but we were advised that they liked to reserve that for big parties, fair enough. 20 minutes passed by and no big party that came.   2. Drinks - The person who sat us got our drink orders but it took them forever to get me a regular cup of coffee and they had no half-and-half which I found weird but ok.   3. Order - It took about 20 minutes as well for them to come in and get our orders. I asked for crispy Belgian waffle, side of scrambled eggs with cheese, and a side of crispy bacon. My husband ordered avocado toast. This took more than 30 minutes and i noticed a couple who sat by the bar and who came in after us get their order first. The manager/owner came up to our table and said he was going to give us free dessert 'on the house,' because of the wait and apologized profusely. When my order came, it was a waffle with fruits and whipped cream. I asked our server if it normally came with fruit and he said, he wasn't going to charge me for the fruit and the cook was new and 'hooked me up.' Though it is normally nice to be 'hooked up,' please do not mess with my breakfast. Needless to say, my waffle wasn't crispy as it was doused in maple syrup, my eggs didn't have cheese and my bacon was not crispy. My husband's avocado toast, he was happy with though he found it weird there was yogurt on the plate of his avocado toast. I really don't understand how people can eff up breakfast food. What really got me was if I didn't ask about the fruit on my waffles, it appears they wouldn't have said anything about getting my order wrong. I like what I like what I like.   4. Dessert - As for the promised dessert on the house, it never came. We asked for the bill and the manager/owner was nowhere to be found. I didn't ask for it as I just wanted to go.   5. Seating, part 2 - A family of 5 came while we were in the midst of eating but other than that no other big party came. I told my husband (and this is going to sound so obnoxious), if by 10-ish, you don't have a list of people to be seated, I highly doubt you're going to fill your dining floor. We have been to too many breakfast places on Sunday to know this.   6. Price - OVERPRICED.   7. Service - We are not above tipping (up to 50%) if we get exceptional service. Sadly, this is not the case.   My husband thinks we should come back and give it a try in 6 months, I nixed it."}
{"text":"Food is great... but the server is a lil slow....and the lady looks grumpy and looks also like she was sucking on a lemon all day....never smiling so serious...."}
{"text":"Literally sat down for about 15 minutes without even getting drinks from the waitress. Then after ordering drinks she walked by me 3 separate times without taking my food order. I got up and left, terrible service!! Sad thing is I really wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"I went to dirty fork enjoyed a good breakfast, service was very good. Mgr/owner \"Fatih\" he was very engaging and made you feel very welcomed. I have eaten there more than once with family and by myself. I have enjoyed each experience."}
{"text":"Portions were huge and the food was just absolutely amazing! The dining room is adorable and everything was just beautiful!"}
{"text":"The people were very nice. Tried the fresh squeezed OJ. Def would do again. French toast. Must try. Coffee was even excellent."}
{"text":"I talked a friend into meeting me here for breakfast this morning at 9 AM.  It's in my neighborhood so I thought I would try it.  Oh, and I also had a flyer on my car that offered free coffee with entree.    There were only about three other occupied tables of two - four at each.  The menu was not very exciting. The waitress was very slow.  When she finally arrived at our table we gave her our order.  I gave her the flyer and she said only one coffee would be no charge since we only had one flyer.  HUH?!?  Seriously??  Obviously this person has no background in the restaurant and/or hospitality arena.  Then we learned they actually serve a small salad with their breakfasts!  YUK!!  If we wanted a substitute it would cost a minimum of $2. The toast was not buttered as most (if not all) restaurants seem to do before serving.  Oh, and they only give you 1 slice of toast which was cold.  However the scrambled eggs, extra crispy bacon and coffee were fine .  Not great, but fine.    My friend agreed with me that we would not return to this establishment again nor would we recommend.  There are so many more that offer better service and pricing for what you get."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY through yelp. We were quoted an hour and a half for some breakfast sandwiches. We called to switch to delivery and they quoted us a half hour. Better but when we arrived, a half hour later, they said it would be an additional 25 minutes. Fine. We get the food and ask for the receipt to check that all items were there. Could not get anyone to give us a receipt so we decided to leave before the food got cold. Get home and we are missing a number of items totaling over $20 and we paid the delivery charge. Absolutely ridiculous. The food was okay but expensive for small portions. No customer service at all."}
{"text":"Never agian! I ordered delivery not only did I wait well over a hour and paid a rediculous amount of money but all these hyped up reviews lead me to a disappointment!   My acai bowl was more like acai soup !  My boyfriends tuna melt was burnt !  My bagel for the lox was saggy.   All around waste of money & time .    Not even enough time to actually go somewhere else to eat due to the fact that we both have work at 3 and this got here at 2:20 although my order confirmation was made at 1:09 .  The manager was contacted and blames the food being burnt and acai bowl being melted as a part of my fault for ordering it in such hot weather and being that I live far .  Even management is a disappointment , take responsibility for your restaurants action we didn't Fuck up our order you guys did !!"}
{"text":"We got a Groupon to check out this new restaurant. Atmosphere is quaint; tables are close together so you can hear the conversation next to you, but it's not too distracting. The cooks are out in the open & you can see the kitchen and the serving area, so you know exactly how long your food sits & waits once it is plated. Saturday afternoon, not too busy, & we were seated immediately. We ordered both breakfast and lunch items. The bacon was extra crispy. Burgers cooked well. Fries had an added herb/spice that made them savory over salty. Sadly, as we went to pay the owner elected to charge a \"Groupon tax\" after the fact. We use Groupon to test out a lot of new restaurants and we've never had to pay this fee. We contacted Groupon & they handled it for us, but it kinda spoiled the meal to argue with the manager over this random fee. Hopefully, they will fix this for their future customers."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there and it was Amazing... Customer service was spot on.. Very good experience we will be back for sure....!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. The food is great, fresh. The server was lovely.  Cute spot . Very modern.  I love the coffee and fresh OJ.  The pancakes were delicious and omelette was very good. I'm glad I found a new breakfast place , will be back soon to check out the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while and today I ran upon their deal on Groupon so I felt like that was a sign that it was finally time to try it out! We came in around 11:30am and were seated right away. I really enjoyed the interior and decor of the restaurant, I felt like it was very cute and quaint which is the perfect design for a breakfast/brunch place! :) The menus have two sides - one side for breakfast and the other for lunch. There were a variety of options which made it hard to choose but we decided to go for the \"Fatty Burrito\" and the \"Dirty Fork Lunch Special.\" I subbed the bacon on the breakfast burrito for turkey bacon and salad instead of fresh fruit on the side and my bf subbed his side for hash browns with onions (which was phenomenal!).   Our food took a while to come out considering the fact there was only two other tables in the restaurant but our server was super friendly and kept refilling our waters and reassuring us that our food would be out soon. I wasn't entirely impressed with the burrito and halfway while I was eating I noticed that I didn't get my pico de gallo that comes with it, but the server was able to bring me out a side of it immediately. my bf's entree was very delicious! It consisted of salmon, poached eggs, mushrooms, veggies, and butter on top of a whole grain toast - definitely recommend to try this dish!   Overall, it was a good first time experience. The owner came around making sure we were enjoying our food and at the end, even gave us a flyer that gives us two free coffees on our next visit, yay!"}
{"text":"The place is so nice on the inside I loved it. The food is very plain though. The eggs taste not that good. I got like the Hawaiian French Toast and it was so plain it had a little dab or cram cheese on top of it and ta da! Reccommend if you want plain food but other than that's it's not that bad ?"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place for a long time and I decided to come here for my brunch. Ordered Sunrise Sammy, Breakfast special and couple sides including french fries, hash browns. We also requested to put fried chicken on the side instead of combining into our toast ( Breakfast special).   As we shared our dishes, we got chances to try a bit of everything. So, it's weird to say but we actually like the side dishes than the main entrées we ordered!!! Toasts that were in the Breakfast special was too sweet and the fried chicken was dry and lack of flavour. Sunrise Sammy, which is a croissant stuffed with bacon, egg and cheddar, was very dry and not warm. Hash browns were the only dish we enjoyed eating...   Staff were not very attentive and helpful. We had to wave a lot of time before they could spot us, which was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The service is horrible...they mess up your order repeatedly and say its because \"they are busy\" ???  You should be its a restaurant!!....The girl Julin (How ever you spell it). Say's she created the menu and makes a point to tell every table she goes to that she lives in santa monica...so ..your headed back home so that gives you a reason to give shitty service???? Disgustingly rude.My order was literally taken back 4 times. If i could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed, everything lacked flavor and was expensive compared to other places in the area. Used a Groupon and they charged us a $2 \"groupon tax\" in addition to the tax we paid on the extra amount not covered by the $20 groupon. And believe me $20 will not cover your lunch/breakfast. I now understand why the place was empty, pretty sure it will be closed soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! So cute! Food is amazing,... cute lil bistro style breakfast lunch spot and reasonable"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fairly surprised by the Dirty Fork Breakfast special. A unique combo but works soooo good together. We also got the breakfast Sammy sandwich and that was delicious!!! Def will be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Small, friendly and clean environment. Nice background music.  Had lox--excellent! Hubby had fatty burrito--excellent as well. Delicious fresh fruit as well.  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a little bit leery on coming here for breakfast today based on all the reviews. But I'm glad I came anyway. My friend had the fatty burrito and I had the breakfast special with a side of Hawaiian rice. I feel the waitress was very accommodating  to all our requests . Everything came out delicious. My friend had a coupon for free coffee and when I checked in on Yelp we got a free soda, they honored both. I almost got some pastries to go but I was so full. The service was better-than- reviewed and my coffee never went empty. The waitress checked on us often. There was no wait to sit down, it was actually kind of dead inside. The only downside are the prices, they are a little higher than I expected but the flavor makes up for the price. If you are on the side of town I suggest giving them a try."}
{"text":"Second visit was more impressive--they do a nice job with their crepes, which taste fresh and come with a generous portion of the fruit of your choice (between strawberries and banana). For the serving size, it is a reasonable price. It's something I would order again."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago and enjoyed lunch here. Had the burger. Great bring your appetite though. Burger is hearty and very juicy. Did not have much room for the fries. I tried my best because they were crispy. Owners a buddy and very nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast by myself which is nice because they have a coffee bar area to sit at. Amazing food. I had the Belgium waffles with fresh fruit and it was great. A must go to!"}
{"text":"Rolled in here on a Sunday morning around 10am. Prime breakfast time, but fortunately no line here. In fact, only about 3 tables were filled. That had me a little bit worried.  It's a small place, maybe 15 or so tables. Very clean and well decorated. My friend and I sat down and ordered our drinks, coffee for me and water for him. Both of these cups were never empty. They even bring a fancy bottle with water for your table...nice touch!  Service was excellent. Maybe because it wasn't crowded, but our server took his time and let us check out the menu, answered all questions with accuracy and knowledge, and did a great job. No complaint here.  On to the food. I had the 9th island French Toast, my friend the Dirty Fork breakfast special, which was chicken and eggs on top of french toast. Both were well cooked, and delicious. Coconut, passionfruit or guava syrup. Very enjoyable meal!  I'd come back, as would my friend. Prices were very fair, I think $11.95 for the French Toast."}
{"text":"I ordered an avocado toast. Not only did it only come with one piece of toast. The avocado is really hard and isn't really ripe. Tried calling the restaurant to complain. Obviously no answer. If I could do no stars I would, worst $10 on a piece of toast. Remind you 1 piece of toast !!"}
{"text":"Got the breakfast panini ..... bread was soft not crunchy and it was drenched in oil . Not what I expected at all . No flavor and dripping in oil . Maybe other things on the menu are better but I don't think I'll go back for breakfast at least . My stomach is turning ."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at the dirty fork and I've got to say it made my whole day! I am just finishing up my coffee after a wonderful visit with Carissa She is super super polite  and warmed up the whole environment with your great smile and attitude Make sure you ask for Carissa when you come in and she's worth every penny of the bill and the Tip"}
{"text":"Food was good, but what would've made it better is the service. Irma never checked how the food was. After food delivery she was busy training a guy and teaching him how to make cappuccinos. I needed a touch more syrup on my French toast. Secondly on the picture on yelp there was more yogurt looking substance on the French toast than 2 squirts literally. And it states on the menu that you can add fruit well DONT! It already comes with fruit and I didn't want any. The Sunrise Sammy is good but croissant is way too toasted that the ends are so hard I left it behind. Like the croissant was toasted over and over. Honestly, server didn't deserve tip; she bought water with no ice which I never once stated I DIDNT want ice, she took order and delivered. Than I went up to register asking to pay. That was NOT service!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. All 3 breakfast dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious. Lox breakfast, DF breakfast special, and the What the Fork omelet!! Owner is very genuine and the place is decorated very nicely. It's a great place for family, business, or just because you're lazy and don't want to cook. Trust me, this place is worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today ended up ordering off the breakfast menu for the most part. Just a few other tables were occupied and 1 waitress to assist. We ordered a sprite and iced latte and waters to drink. We got an acai bowl, French toast, pancakes and tea sandwich. The acai bowl was alright, it wasn't as sweet as we hoped but still good. The French toast with fruit was tasty. The pancakes were a little on the dry side but huge portion. The tea sandwich came with tiramisu and macaroons. The spread on the sandwich we good, the tiramisu would've been better if it weren't so dry. Oh and fries which were awesome with ranch! The fries saved the rating! They were nice and crispy. Good thing we had a groupon because the bill was $60 and we didn't even have meat. It was nice to try someplace different. It's not close to home so we probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"First time visiting this establishment. Very clean, generous portions, great ambiance, and kid friendly. Breakfast and Lunch was amazing. Located right across from a soccer complex so it's a great place for in between tournament games!"}
{"text":"This is another breakfast lunch restaurant with a Hawaiian twist to it closing at 3:30 pm.  I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered so far this being my second visit.  The short stack with guava syrup was awesome, steak and eggs great size steak good value.  I would recommend this restaurant for the easy service they come by just the right amount of times."}
{"text":"The menu selection is fantastic!the presentation of the food is excellent as well.i totally recommend this establishment!perfect for breakfast"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and we're seated promptly. Unfortunately we got sat after a party of 8 shortly ahead of us so we had about a 28 minute wait to get our food.  One server attending to the floor so we had 1 coffee within that wait time and one croissant. Once the food arrived I pushed stop on my stopwatch and took a couple pictures of the food. This place won my heart over and I forgive the server due to my serving background and will still receive a nice tip . The food was incredible though...maybe worth the wait? You decide! I had the Dirty Fork Special! My wife had the sunrise Sammy (croissant sand which) which was Amazing. We can't wait to try lunch here one day !"}
{"text":"I would've given one star if the croissant wasn't yummy but it was. I walk in, no greeting. Service was below average. Food looked to die for, but it was crap, I could've made it better at home. The almond croissant was massive and way better than my actual entree. The price was not decent at all for that kind of quality food. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"It's always a treat to see new restaurants open up and offer their creative food adaptations to the typical menu.  Dirty fork delivers a tasty take on European and Hawaiian fare. I've sampled their Sunrise Sammy, Dirty Fork Breakfast Special and their pastries. I can say I was not displeased at all by any of my menu suggestions. Both main dishes were very tasty and fulfilling. I could not finish either one of them. And on both occasions my server was very pleasant and observant. The costs to dine here is just as laid back as the atmosphere.  They have tables outside as well if you wanted to do some street watching. Its nice to see local businesses offer delicious food and reasonable prices. They also Hawaiian sun drinks, just FYI for all the 9th islanders. Their sodas are by the can."}
