{"text":"Great little place on Kingston. We have only been here for brunch but the dinner menu looks good. For brunch I usually go for the Breakfast and those HP potatoes are amazing! Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Portions are a little small but perfect for if you're not feeling too hungry."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burger in the city.  It run on the smallish side but it is filling  with a small but satisfying portion of fries.    The bun is baked in house.  Its juicy and cooked perfectly.  Great staff and nice room.   They should expand the selection of beer though."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great staff, and food miles better than some of the most expensive restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I have been to the Beach Tree approximately 10x since it opened and it has never been a let down. The service is consistently excellent and the dishes on offer are a step above anything else in The Beaches.  It is absolutely a hidden gem and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Such wonderful attention paid to each plate.   Excellent wine pairings.  Casual but sophisticated atmosphere.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Beech Tree with two other couples with whom we meet up with and dine at a different restaurants every few months. Personally I was underwhelmed by my experience at this restaurant.  The service was outstanding with the wait staff being very attentive.  They all worked together with one picking up where others couldn't get to quickly.  The facilities were clean and the decor was okay. The washroom is rather inconvenient being in the basement at the far end but I'm sure most of the restaurants in the area are like that.  The meal was the most disappointing part of my visit.  I like a well rounded meal which I consider to be one with  meat, vegetables and potatoes/rice with the option of soup or salad.  There were no items on the menu I could see that were clearly discernible as standard type salads or soup.  My experience with dining is that as soon as I see a lot of items on the menu with names and/or terms I'm not familiar with I'm going to be getting a \"fancy\" meal that's more than likely lean on substance.  This visit reaffirmed that notion for me..    My inclination was to go for the hamburger platter since it was the only item that would clearly give me most of what I was looking for (plus it's hard to screw up).  I resisted that nagging and persistent urge because I believe in expanding my horizon by tasting and trying new things.  I asked about the Buffalo entre which I had hope was going to be a nice cut with all the trimmings but discovered that it was some sort of salad/meat combination which I felt would only be adequate if I wasn't that hungry.  Typically I find those entres are usually a little too light on the meat.  I decided to have the grilled steak ($24), the others had arctic char, ribs and the hamburger platter.  The presentations of all of the meals was very nice. My steak was prepared exactly as I had asked (medium-rare) however it wasn't what I would consider a steak.  It was sliced steak fanned out which probably would have amounted to about 4 or 5 ounces at the most. The waiter did tell me that there were two potatoes but he forgot to mention that they were about 1 inch in diameter. Vegetable portion was small. The quality of the cut of meat was my biggest issue with this meal - I was very unhappy about that considering the price.  I'm not a big eater any more but having said that I still found the portion size of the meal very small.  To balance the it out I had to have a desert which I don't normally do as I try to stay away from too much sugar.  (The desert was delicious btw...lol.)  For what it's worth, I do believe the chef did a very nice job preparing the meal. My feeling is and that their problem was simply a matter of \"quality in = quality out\" which may have been beyond the control of the chef.  As a final note, I think it's interesting to note that the only person that commented positively on their meal was the guy who had the hamburger platter. No one else commented on their meal in any substantial way and no one asked anyone else how they like their meals either.  I think we were all feeling a little underwhelmed about them."}
{"text":"Great food - despite being small portions - packs a super tasty punch. Small selection of good beer on tap, and service is - meh. But great small quiet place to go for dinner in the Beaches."}
{"text":"The food is delicious -- great addition to the neighbourhood. One criticism would be that the larger plates are meat, meat and meat (at least on the November/December menu), so my date and I had to make a meal of the small plates. Salads, gnocchi and warm olives were delish -- especially the gnocchi -- but the resulting bill at the end of the night seemed way to high for what we ate (for our little neighbourhood at least). Service and decor are lovely. Would definitely return for some fish or veggie main courses, or maybe just a drink and snack...."}
{"text":"Beautiful new spot in a lovely neighbourhood in the Upper Beaches.  The food was delicious (I had the burger).  I was most impressed with the scotch egg that came on the charcuterie platter which was the special appetizer of the night.  I haven't eaten a better scotch egg even in the UK!  Also had a nice selection of wines - try the Shiraz, it's amazing!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food or service. Recently had the lamb done 'sous vide' style: tender and tasty.     Reservations a must as it is small venue with little elbow room but then you're likely to meet a neighbour or make new friends."}
{"text":"This place is great. We got there (group of 7) and our table wasn't fully ready so 4 got seated, while 3 of us had a drink at the bar. It was much fun and the host was very kind, comping us 3 our refreshment due to the inconvenience. That was a brilliant touch indeed. It was very cozy on a cold winter night and once we all got seated everyone had a great dinner. I think the pricing is very good and had the octopus and the small gnocchi which combined were very filling for a total of $25. The burgers were a big hit as was the tuna (fish of the day). The service was very friendly and the place has a great energy. Well done."}
{"text":"Tried out this new bistro pub in the east end tonight. A great addition to the neighbourhood which really was missing a nice resto for food lovers. Burger was delish and the thyme ailoli was really sinful (in the best possible way). Best scotch egg I've had in the city.   They pickle their own veg and everything's from scratch. Wish we had room for desert which sounds great. Hopefully next time!"}
{"text":"Food not bad...way overpriced for what it is. The service is good but it takes forever to get served."}
{"text":"Amazing food... The presentation, quality, taste and portion size are perfect.  Comfortable, easy going atmosphere with fabulous staff.  We have gone several times including the last two new years where they kindly accomodated our vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"Outstanding from start to finish.  I ordered the chicken which was perfect, and my husband ordered the Cornish Hen, which he said was delicious.  We can't wait to return.  Now shhhhh don't tell anyone....we want to make sure we can get in whenever we want."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this is my FAVOURITE restaurant at the moment! Like really- in all of Toronto! I've tried a lot of things on the menu, nothing has ever disappointed me.. (and I always get the sausage rolls- they are a must.. OH and the chocolate cake. I am literally salivating right now). This is right on the corner of my street, and it's so convenient. But if it weren't I'd still make the trek! The owner is just great- he always remembers us when we go in. LOVE it, really hoping my husband decides to take me here for Mother's Day or something soon."}
{"text":"Had the same experience as Chris N. below, we had reservations (on my birthday), waited an hour and a half to get our table and then ended up leaving before even ordering any food because we were starving. We got a shrug and no real apology (\"it's Saturday and we're busy\" - we had a reservation!), have heard the food but the customer service and attitude were appalling."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for dinner this past Wednesday. Both the server and bartender were friendly and attentive. We were informed about the $8 cocktail special, which is an awesome deal for the quality of drinks they had. I'd go back just to try more of these drinks! I had the Mojito and the Maple Rosemary sour, soooo good. For apps we had the open ravioli and the beet salad, both were delicious, loved the braised lamb in the ravioli. For mains I had the pork and my husband had the steak. I loved my dish, however, my husband's steak was overdone, which seems minor, but it affected the dish pretty greatly. Also, if you're looking for large portions, this isn't the place to go. The quality of the food is fantastic and that's where your money goes, the portions are comparable to fine dining. I'd definitely return though, even just a for drinks :)"}
{"text":"3 out of 5 stars because the food was OK. Service on Valentine's Day wasn't great. Rush our courses but took a lifetime for our bottle of wine to show up. Washrooms are some what of a joke. Horrible lighting (lack of lighting) very awkward toilets and placement of shall. All in all over priced for a meh experience. Left very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my fav restaurant in Toronto I hear they are not the greatest with seating times/reservations- but we've not had a problem getting a table. Once we had to wait 30 mins w/out reso. It's a very small restaurant, very inviting and cozy. The food is so delicious it's almost hard to believe. Portion sizes are on the smaller side, which I like bc it leaves room for an app or dessert.  Me and my bf usually order a drink each, and either an app to share and main each OR 3 apps to share and maybe a dessert to share and our bill always ends up being $80 with tax(before tip). So it's a little on the more expensive side, but the value is crazy. I literally cannot believe every single bite I take, the flavours are so delicious and balanced."}
{"text":"Food was good, service has gone down hill hill since the old manager left.   Truly not tentative and riding on coat tails.  Will try perhaps one more time.   Not overly impressed on this round.   Should have taken a few lessons from the last greats here."}
{"text":"Read the great reviews but unfortunately didn't hit the mark. Tried this place on a Saturday morning for brunch. The restaurant was practically empty at noon which wasn't a great sign. Ordered a classic breakfast. The yolk of my poached egg was fully cooked and not runny as a poached egg is meant to be. The sausage was horrible. It tasted like it was in the freezer for a while and very poor, store bought quality. Side potatoes were really nice. For what it's worth, the service was great. Very attentive staff that made the non-food part of the dining experience very enjoyable. Maybe just an off day for the chef but unfortunately won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Maureen B. Second go at The Beech Tree after a mixed feeling the first time around. Confirmed that the portion sizes are ridiculously small for the price! Our cod entrees were really appetizer sized and left hungry. Service was good. Menu was very limited. Basically three entrees to choose from. I would not go back despite that it is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Web site indicates this place is open Sundays. Heard great things, made the trip on a Sunday only to find it closed, no explanation. Called and message gives \"hours for this week\" which don't include Sunday so clearly there was no emergency to explain the closure. I don't think this is a good way to run a business. People don't call to check hours if they're posted on a web site."}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant last night. Mother had the burger and I had the lamb pie (I forget what it was called) and they both taste great. For 13 bucks you would expect more of a meal, but once you tried it, it was so delicious and rich. The waiter was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy.  Only complaint was, with such a small place, there was a bit of a chill. Make sure you wear something with sleeves."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday around noon and was able to sit right away.  My friend and I both ordered the sweet corn fritters with a side of potatoes. Then for a little \"dessert\" we go the fresh baked cheddar scone. Amazing. We finished every bite. Nov '17"}
{"text":"We came here to commemorate a landmark review for a fellow Yelper. The reviews seemed like it was worth the trek up to this area but alas nope. The place was packed even though it was Sunday. Luckily we had reservations so had our spot secured.  For starters I expect a gastro pub to have decent beer list but nope not here. Just 4 offerings take or leave it. The server was kind enough to let me sample one type but it  was not to my liking. Their cocktail list is impressive so we ordered a trio of em. For starters we had the following three items Cauliflower and Stilton on toast (didn't try but I recall other diners saying it was decent) A warm salad of celeriac, smoked arctic char, quail egg, wild rice and cider vinaigrette (this was decent on the bite I tried) Chicken Liver mousse with poached pears and toasts (website says Foie gras so I had my eyes on it beforehand) Meh I the accoutrements were decent but the main  was nothing above what one buys at a store. Not seasoned well IMO. Just a slight amount maldon salt was not enough to elevate this dish.  For the mains I had the burger fellow diners had the slow braised lamb hot pot with pickled vegetables and gnocchi as the main. The portions are minuscule so I am glad we ordered starters as would have gone home unfulfilled. The fries were OK. The Burger wasn't good. The bun became so soggy that I had to eat it upside down half way.  I guess this is a neighborhood hangout as the local traffic will keep it afloat. Not worth a detour if you are not a local.  3 Stars"}
{"text":"New fave spot in the East End! Saw a post by the owner on the local neighbourhood Facebook group, decided to give it a try and was not let down. The wine selection is great (though didn't indulge in any) and our cocktails were some of the best in the city - including ones we've paid much more in bars and hotel lobbies downtown. The appetizers were particularly good, I will be back for the grilled octopus and scallops. The mains were not as notable but still seriously good. I would love to come back in the winter as it's just a cozy spot with friendly service. Everything you want in a restaurant - well priced, delicious food, yummy drinks - and all without the pretentious flair of your regular Toronto dining experience. I am thrilled to have this in the hood, I wish I could keep it a secret :)"}
{"text":"My partner and I visited this restaurant on our anniversary and it was absolutely amazing! We started with the scallops and charcuterie platter. Both were excellent! We especially loved the chicken pate. For our mains, we got the duck and the pork loin. The flavours were delicious and I was extremely impressed. We shared the cheese plate and flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Both were, of course, amazing! We had cocktails throughout dinner, which were made to perfection. I can't wait to visit this restaurant again soon! They had our reservation booked and we were seated promptly. The atmosphere was exciting and decor was very nice."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at The Beech Tree. It was excellent. The asparagus appetizer is delicious. Great mains - amazing trout special and great beef brisket. The best part was the dessert. I am a flourless chocolate cake lover and the Beech Tree's offering is the BEST I've had!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally, a great food option in the Beach. Delicious food, good service, and nice atmosphere. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the fries to die for, and the burger very tasty. The menu is limited, but that's a good thing. You can tell everything is made from scratch. Such a refreshing change from the cooked-from-frozen other dining options nearby."}
{"text":"Great menu and close to home, but I give it three stars because it's a little overpriced for new Canadian type dishes. Like simple dishes with a (small portion of) starch and protein are close to $30. I am not a huge eater and not portion focused, but either lower the price or put a little more on the plate when using inexpensive ingredients/preparations."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 4 star review but we made reservations, got there, ordered and were told we only had 2 hours to eat our food and leave. We were told they have 2 hour seatings, however We weren't told this when making reservations. Some of the food was very tasty, other things were not so great. They were also out of a few of the wines."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came here for the summerlicious event. I ordered the grilled calamari as the appetizer it was not as good as I expected because of the sauce. For the main course I do recommend the short ribs over the lamb if you don't like the taste of lambs (very strong). For dessert I ordered the chocolate cake and it was way too sweet for my preference and the sour cream made it worst."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Just what out neighborhood needed.  Love this place. Really friendly staff an owner."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews about Beech Tree, my wife and I had to try it out. I'd have to say that it seems pretty overhyped.   We were there on a Friday night at 6pm, and was told that the appetizer I wanted to order was sold out, which was puzzling given that it was only 6pm. I told the waiter that I'd skip the appetizer then since there was anything I wanted, which resulted in me getting some unnecessary attitude by the waiter. I didn't realize it was mandatory to order apps at a restaurant! I ordered the fried chicken entree which was extremely salty, bordering on inedible but I didn't have the heart to send it back. For the price of entrees though, I'd expect the food to be top notch which it definitely was not.   We probably won't be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was so impressed by this gem. Everything we ate was delicious. I would have paid a lot more for the quality. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for what it is. It's a cute little neighbourhood place in the beach which frankly, we don't have enough of. I had the sausage roll for an appetizer and the gnocchi for dinner. The role was pretty tasty. Simple. The gnocchi was a touch on the sweet side but still good. I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"Went in on wed night and everything was great. We got seated right away. Being from Montreal we always find Toronto restos lack some quality food but it was not the case for this resto. They have some decent beers on tap on top of wine list . Would def go back."}
{"text":"Love!!! So happy to have a place like this walking distance from home. The food is very good and the menu changes quite a bit, with the seasons. The service is fine, but not incredible. They tend to have a very creative drink menu, all very yummy. Recommended for a quite summer date night. Hope this place lasts in the beaches!!"}
{"text":"The Beech Tree is definitely an excellent \"bar\" if you want to have a drink.  Amazing Cocktail list! I would never have expected from this neighborhood! The cocktail serves here uses fresh-squeezed fruit juice and House Made Syrups, bitters and grenadines! And I just love the cocktails we ordered which all prepared with cared and skills.  For beer lovers, there are beers from Amsterdam, Beau's, Left Field and Kawartha Lakes available on tap. They can even give you a taster before you commit. For wine lovers, there are wine available in glass from local and around the World.   The Beech Tree is definitely an excellent \"restaurant\" if you want to enjoy some well prepared food. The food here is all seasonal and locally sourced prepared from scratch, that includes the bread, pickled vegetables, sauces and the cured meat!  Cauliflower and Stilton on toast ($5) Chicken liver parfait with poached pears and toasts ($11) A warm salad of smoked arctic char w/ celeriac croquette, quail egg, wild rice and cider vinaigrette ($12) Gnocchi with rosemary and parsnip ($16) Slow braised lamb hot pot with pickled vegetables ($13)  The appetizers and mains I tried were all nicely presented with interesting combination of ingredients and flavors.  The complimentary mini peanut butter chocolate torte was so rich and it was the perfect to end the evening!  Highly recommend to give The Beech Tree if you are in the area! But remember to make a reservation as the restaurant is quite small and with limited seating!"}
{"text":"Everyone else enjoyed their meals, but I had a difficult time finding something that could accommodate my allergies. One of our party enjoyed the burger and another settled on a pleasing vegan option. Bright décor and comfortable seats (we chose the banquette, natch). Bathrooms are in the basement as is common in Toronto. Prices for food and beverages were comparable to those that we pay in London for the same type of experience.   I wouldn't return because there are many other restos where I would have more selection."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner!! We had a number of appetizers to share amongst our table such as the sage gnocchi, fish cakes, cauliflower and pork ringlette soup, mixed olives and all so delicious! My favourate was the sage gnocchi and some of the others at the table couldn't get over the olives, fish cakes and soup so all appetizers received top marks!  For dinner we ordered pork chops and the burgers.  I have to say the food is so delicious, fresh and quality ingredients and the chef puts a twist on simple food like cabbage.  The pork chops melted like butter and the side creamed cabbage dish was the best cabbage we have ever had!  The fries with the burger were so decadent and they had a side dipping sauce made with beer that was to die for!!  Portions are just right and you leave feeling like you have had a great meal at a very affordable price.  This is a local, non-franchise restaurant that has great tasting food and service.  It is something that you have to check out.  I will definetely be back and want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was good, and had been trying to find a time. Tinight was the night, everything was perfect, ambiance was was and cozy, friendly, service was perfect, sensitive, attentive, food was beyond perfect, every nuance, every touch was breathtaking. I wanted to lick each plate. I'm not brushing my teeth tonight because I want to savour it as long as possible. I hesitate in telling you all because I always want to have a seat Here to enjoy their perfect food."}
