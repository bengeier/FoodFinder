{"text":"very disappointing I ordered xlarge pizza for $10.99 I got a large 8 pieces is a large .greasy pizza ! won't go back."}
{"text":"great pizza. lots of veggies. spicy fries are yum!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and chicken wings.We usually get delivery which to my surprise is pretty quick,and thats hard to find any more..yep!! i am a fan!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here, and it was pretty good. I got the XL pizza and the half bucket of bbq chicken wings. I usually don't like wings that aren't from Wing Stop or BWW, lol but these were actually pretty good. The pizza had fresh pineapple which was a little confusing, but it was still good lol. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"GREAT Pizza, GREAT Price, XL 1 topping for $9.95?? Can't beat that! We love the supreme \"well done\" comes out with a little crispier of a crust, top and bottom. YUM!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best local pizza I've ever had. I'm not trying to say it will beat places like Settebello or Grimaldi's, because I wouldn't really consider those a \"local pizza shop.\" Those places are specialty type places, and the prices match that luxury. Joey's has an XL 1-topping pizza for like 12 bucks. Get a pepperoni cooked well done and you will be so happy, you won't know what to do with yourself. Their wings are also fan-freaking-tastic. I would recommend getting them dry with the sauce on the side, but I would always recommend that for to-go wings; it really cuts down on the soggy factor, which I think gives many places an unfair shake. Their ranch is exquisite, and I never get the pizza without it. The mushrooms on the pizza are fresh, and really taste like mushrooms. Ordering almost anything to-go takes them 15 minutes, and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes if they had a rush. Seriously, anyone who doesn't like their pizza doesn't like NY style pizza, caught them on a bad day (which has never happened to me after ordering at least 20 times), expects things from a PIZZA place that you shouldn't (chicken fingers? Go to KFC for that), or should really just stick to places like California Pizza Kitchen. For those of us who like folding their pizza, having excellent quality cheese with excellent quality grease, you can't go wrong with Joey's.

P.S. Look at the pictures; even when people didn't like the pizza, it looks amazing. And it tastes just as good as it looks. Best crust in town, maybe. Seriously."}
{"text":"Service was great pizza was better ! Recommended for sure ! Fast service, bomb pizza . Ask for specials they have an extra large for 8.50 pick up that's plenty of pizza for the family!"}
{"text":"this place is the worst. I spent $50 bucks at this place for dinner. got a philly sandwich that was dry, fries were burnt. fingers we got hot and mild. but they didn't bring us ranch for them or ketchup for the fries. Called to make complaint and was told the driver would be back out to bring us some ranch but needless to say he never showed up. I have had complaints on this place in the past but decided to give them another chance. What a mistake. last time I called and made a complaint and was told by the owner that he has been in business so long that I would not make or break him if I didn't come back as a customer and hung up on me. Screw this place and their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Love the pizza from Joey's! We don't live anywhere near it but I will gladly drive there for the pizza & cheesy garlic bread! It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I ever tasted ordered pineapple and cheese pizza they were very skimpy with there pineapples and pizza was cold . Also fries were under cooked. There pizza used to be great now I have to find a new pizza place"}
{"text":"Would do No stars but yelp doesn't allow that.
Never never never again
Delivered raw Stromboli called back to them only to be told \"we put it in an extra 5 mins\"
What a joke!"}
{"text":"Ordered their large pizza special, asked for extra sauce on it, but wait that's an extra charge.  Charge extra for a little extra pizza sauce (when it really needs it).  Never heard that one before.  Keep your pizza, I can order pizza elsewhere without asking."}
{"text":"Local neighborhood pizza joint.  Their pizza flavors are above the popular pizza chains and the price are quite affordable especially with their pizza carry out special.  However I do not recommend getting other items on their menu unless you have to because after all their specialty is pizza and not other type of foods."}
{"text":"Far and away the best place to get hot wings on the east side. Great deals for pizza if you do pick up."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! best pizza I've had in Vegas and its not expensive! they have a $6 Large special too. The Antipasto salad is amazing and the ranch rocks ... I'm pretty sure they make it there. The Taco pizza is KILLER. I live right down the street and if I lived on the northwest side I would drive across town for this pizza ... LOVE!"}
{"text":"Fraud fraud fraud.... if u want to get charged for waaaaay more than u got go here.... food sucks and 2 times ive had to cancel my bank account cause they overcharged and wont fix it"}
{"text":"Attempted to order a pizza from here.  Driver apparently delivered it to the wrong address.  Driver then went back without making  any further attempt to contact us .  Calling the store we were told that they would not deliver the pizza, but they kept our money.  Do not order from this store for delivery.  I would give them 0 stars  if I could."}
{"text":"I bought a x-large pizza and an order of chicken wings. The chicken was not to bad but, the pizza was just horrible. It had two pieces of pepperoni on each piece. The pizza taste horrible. That was the first time and last time ordering food from the nellis and desert inn location."}
{"text":"I've been eating joeys pizza since I was in elementary school and it has always been my absolute favorite!!! My dad used to do the plumbing there before he passed away so we used to eat joeys ALL THE TIME!! They have the BEST ranch!! Chicken fingers and fries are delicious and fingers are huge!! Pizza is delicious I prefer easy sauce tho!!"}
{"text":"Always very nice and great service every time. They know my face and my order soon as they see me. Pizza is delicious! Best pizza in vegas for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The pizza is as good as any in Las Vegas. The service is first class. The menu is diverse.  And best of all the prices are very reasonable! !!!!"}
{"text":"Pass!
About 3 weeks ago,I ordered delivery for the Joey's special pizza, wings and antipasto salad, 50 minutes later, pizza was very soft, soggy and not cooked all the way. Wings and salad were ok.  Decided to give them a 2nd chance and WENT to Joey's, ordered the same thing, thinking that maybe the delivery driver had a lot of deliveries and thus the reason for the soggy pizza last time. Took order straight home (2 minutes) and pizza was even worse than the first time. Wasn't even cooked thoroughly. Waste of money. 
Search for a good pizza in this area continues."}
{"text":"Ordered their #4 last night (1 large pizza, 12 wings,Garlic bread and2 litre pepsi) and everything was amazing. I chose the buffalo hot wings and they had that zing ive been looking for for a long time. we got everything fresh out of the oven and exactly 15 mins like the guy who assisted us said. would love to come back but we're leaving for TN tomorrow. Thank you Joey's!"}
{"text":"Not as awesome as ot use to be. The pizza is amazing but they always get my order wrong. I moved on to another pizza place."}
{"text":"Sorry Joeys has new owners I was told the pizza was the same. Not even close. Soggy crust never acceptable . Still a good price if the pizza was good."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST tasting pizza's I have found in town.  Chicken fingers are delicious and so are the French-fries. You'll have to try it for yourself. 
Enjoy!!!! I give them 5 stars.  Friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"This Pizza was Chicago excellent.  I am critical of my pie and i love their pizza."}
{"text":"Just ordered from this shop. The pizza was good and so were the garlic knots! They arrived on time  to was told it was 40-50 minutes and they arrived in 40 I noticed from the time I called them. I would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"4 stars for Pizza quality.

Would have given 5 stars if the shop looked less ghetto.  I'm not sure if the shop looked any better, they would make pizzas better than what they already have.  

QUALITY
Joey's pizza tastes good. If you are used to having a pizza from one of those popular chains (Dominos, Pizza Hut) regularly, treat yourself with a good tasting pizza from here.

OPTIONS
I got a 14\" large pizza with 5 (yes five!!) toppings for just 14.99.  Went with all veggie toppings. Next time I will swap those jalapeno topping for extra olives or mushrooms.  But nevertheless Pizza still tasted good.

VALUE
What you get is definitely more than what you pay for. What was supposed to be a pizza dinner for two of us, easily made for left over breakfast for next day morning (having all veggie toppings helped for having it as breakfast).

Would definitely go back next time I crave Pizza."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible. I ordered a \"specialty\" corizo pizza, it was actually a cheese pizza with a couple of bits of corizo on top of the pizza, instead of just charging me for just a 1 topping pizza they charge me there $15 specialty pizza price. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because I also ordered a bacon, pineapple, ham pizza and it was pretty good, very fast as well."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. Probably will not order again because of the service I received. The delivery driver tried calling me because he could not find my apartment. He left me a very unprofessional voicemail saying he \"wasn't going to walk around and if I wanted my food delivered to call him back. I then had to go find him to meet him to receive my food. 

After spending $45 dollars, that was not the best first impression to earn my business back. If he would have politely called and said he could not find my apartment I would have gladly went and met him but to threaten not to deliver my food? I don't think so."}
{"text":"I've had this place a few times and it is definitely worth coming back. 

It is located on the Southeast side of the intersection of Nellis and Desert Inn. I never had the pizza I order delivered, just as carry out. Right now they have a good special going for carry out, 1 large 1 topping for $6.50+tax! 

I've been keeping it simple with deals and such from this place. All I had so far are 1 topping pizzas and Cajun flavored wings. What I like about the pizza best is the crust. It's crunchy, not too doughy, and has a very good taste to it. The toppings are also of good quality and they don't skimp you on the pizza. The wings were also done well. 

I'm not 100% sure, but I'm think all they do is carry out and delivery. I would recommend the place to anyone if you have a pizza craving!"}
{"text":"Saw a review that said don't order delivery because they didn't get their food but I saw more rave reviews and ordered anyway. Low and behold I too am without dinner tonight because the incompetent girl that took my order did not write down my unit # or phone # after I specifically asked her if she needed my phone number in case the driver needed to call she said nope I have it right here and hung up. I called after waiting 1hr and 15 mins (was told 30-40 mins but it was pizza and chix wings so I figured an hours fair) the man that answered repeated back the wrong number said they had no unit # put me on hold 20 mins then must have forgot about me as soon as I heard I dial tone I realized I was no longer their concern. I would order from somewhere else tonight but seeing as I already waited 1.5 hours and it might be another hours wait I'm too pissed to order anything else! Disappointing"}
{"text":"I only gave this restaurant one star because there wasn't a rating any lower. This was without a doubt the worst pizza I've ever had in Las Vegas or anywhere for that matter. if I wanted a cut rate pizza I would've ordered from one of those mass-produced chains where they at least give a discounted price for their low quality products and I still would have at least received a half decent pizza. The pizza from joey's was doughy, undercooked, Limp, soggy and flavorless. I don't mind paying for a good product when I get a good product but I spent $40 on dinner at this place and had it only cost $10 I still would've felt like I overpaid. I don't understand how they stay in business with so many choices here in Vegas and places that actually serve quality food."}
{"text":"I have found my favorite pizza joint! I needed a pizza without marinara sauce since it doesn't agree with me. I always saw Joey's in my searches, but never thought to try it. I was craving pizza. They had this cheese burger pizza....ooooommmmgggg...the crust is perfect. The garlic sauce is splendid. And the service was quick. Soooooo good. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"My friends and I have ordered Joey's pizza twice in the last few weeks and we all agreed that it's the best pizza we've had in Vegas so far. The dough and crust are soft, but not mushy and the sauce has a slight hint of sweetness. Love it. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. I use to live in the Townhouses right behind it and that's how I found it. Now the cook knows me by name and he knows who I am just by the order that I put in. That's what I call great customer service.

I've never had a bad experience with them at all. So far I've had all of the following: taco pizza, gyro, fries, bacon cheeseburger, club sandwich, lasagna, spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo, garlic bread, chicken fingers (bbq, plain, mild), jalapeno poppers,  cheese cake, and a bunch of other stuff. 

I haven't tried everything on the menu, but we're getting close. We usually eat here at least once a month after Bible study right down the street. My absolute favorite thing to order is: Chicken fingers and fries, well done, almost burnt with a side of ranch."}
{"text":"As far back as I can remember my family has been ordering from this place. I love the staff and I love the food! I'm a sucker for a greasy pizza and places that still serves those huge classic chicken fingers! Finger licking good... Literally. Minus a star for location."}
{"text":"Delivered 15 minutes early, everything was still hot, fresh out the oven, and tasty, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Change the times of business operations of this place on here. They close at 10PM on Fridays, not 11PM. Not sure about the other hours, but maybe it'd be a good idea if the hours were updated. It's a bit annoying for customers and other yelpers."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place the pizza tastes so good it's always fresh upon delivery we had a problem the first time that we ordered but they fixed it very quickly with great customer service."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas hands down! That I ever had in Vegas! And I love pizza! It wasn't this location that I went to  the other one isn't showing up. Not sure what the put in the dough or how the toss and cook the pizza it is absolutely delicious! If you live in the north Las Vegas area and love pizza you have to go to joeys!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The first time we ordered delivery from Joey's our food arrived on time and was very tasty. Pizza was excellent. We felt we had found our new pizza joint after just moving to this side of town. 

The next time we ordered, we waited over an hour to be notified that they were \"out of pizza.\" Waitwaitwait. Lemme get this straight. Joey's Pizza...is out...of pizza?? K.

Tonight we decided to give them another shot. Hopefully they've restocked. This time we were told, \"Oh, you're going to have to find someone else, we don't deliver that far.\" *click* That far?? Call me unreasonable, but after double checking on Google Maps, we live 2.77 miles away...not to mention they'd delivered to us before! What gives Joey's?!

We loved the food, but after these two lame experiences we're kinda just over it."}
{"text":"I ordered two large pizzas around 5 pm usually dinner rush for most places the lady on the phone told me that it would be 30 minutes 20 minutes later she called me back saying that she was out of pizza sauce and that the owner was going to go pick some up so she said it will be another 30 minutes I said that is fine I will wait then 30 min later they said it will be about an hour because there is alot of traffic and offered to deliver it to me at that point I just agreed and went home the pizza came around 7 and did not taste good at all it was very greasy and the craust was over cooked this was my first time ordering from this place and it will be my last being in the food industry myself I understand that stuff happens but a pizza place running out of sauce in the middle of dinner rush and not knowing until 20 mins after I had already placed my order is ridiculous if anything I feel like they should of offered me a discount or something real bad business"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Ordered 3 XL pizzas for my bachelorette party I hosted based on the high reviews. It did not disappoint. I would order again for future visits as I am from out state. The place is such a genuine local pizza joint. The pizza is obviously great because he takes care of each pizza he makes! Pizza is not thin but it is not thick. It is perfection."}
{"text":"was told Joeys had great pizza when I moved in to town,I have to say for a small place they do a great business and the pizza is always hot and delicious when it arrives at the door."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Vegas so I could come here as much as I wanted.  Joey's serves the best pizza in Vegas and aren't overpriced to boot!
If you go there, just know anything on the pizza menu is solid.  Joey's has excellent crust and the standard tomato and alfredo sauces.  I prefer the Double Bacon Hamburger pizza myself, but I will try everything hopefully when I head back up to Vegas.  Also they have the best appertizers called garlic balls.  They are small bits of dough that are covered in garlic and butter.  I am not sure if they are fried, or baked, but they were so good.  Beyond good, they were excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery... wasn't great. The pizza was droopy and had very few toppings on it despite being a \"Meat Lover's\" pizza, and the breadsticks were average at best. Expected a little better based on the reviews."}
{"text":"I had a pizza of theirs not too long ago hoping it would be the same. I tried calling to order, no one picked up(yes, this was during operation hours).

I got my usual. Prices went up. The pizza seemed a bit burnt. The flavor that I remember wasn't there."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and stopped in for a salad- the space is literally a walkup counter with a couple of benches, definitely a takeout-only kind of space. There aren't any pics posted of the menu, and there wasn't one available for me to take, so for a basic overview, they have pizza, calzones, burgers, sandwiches, gyros, chicken fingers/wings, and a ton of apps (fries, fried mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, etc). 

Oh, and salads- three kinds. I opted for the grilled chicken, and there was ample protein and the portion was large. Priced at $9, the produce was super fresh, and there was a choice of three dressings. The house blue cheese tasted like a low-priced bulk-jar generic, but it was certainly one of the larger, fresher salads I've had at a run-down pizza joint.

Service was friendly and fast. Space doesn't have much ambiance. They have a 75-cent credit card charge. Prices are fairly low and portions across the board seem to be large, based on other orders I saw being picked up."}
{"text":"Food is Amazing and worth the price!! I've had the pizza, lemon pepper fries (pretty popular), garlic knots, garlic bread and cheesy garlic bread (another customer favorite). They also have chicken fingers, chicken wings, fried mushrooms, you name it, they probably have it. In town and want pizza? order from Joey's. You won't be disappointed. Make sure it's the one on Smoke Ranch and Jones. Friendly staff too!!"}
{"text":"Went based on reviews. Ordered a pizza a wings. Wings were overcooked and very small. Pizza was 1step above LITTLE CEASERS -twice the price and wait. Im angry and want my money back. I m from Chicago. I know good pizza. This AIN'T good pizza!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a few times from here and the food is really good and the delivery is always on time or early.  Great  job with the hot wings, fries and garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. If your looking for severe stomach cramps and diarrhea this is the place to go. Shame on Joey's for not caring enough about their customers to keep their food fresh or their employees clean. Whatever the reason, I'd highly advise thinking twice before eating here. They have not had an inspection since October 2017 and every one (including the last) has come with at LEAST 6 demerits. Including not protecting their food from contaminants.  Yuck. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"If you love greasy pizza this is your place! The best pizza if you like it greasy & really good ranch will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and fast delivery I'd recommend to anyone looking for a great pizza anytime."}
{"text":"Tried Joey's last night for the first time. From a customer recommendation pretty damn good.  I had fried mushrooms and an amazing slice of lasagna.   Cool guy small Gem in NorthWest Las Vegas. Next time I'll try a pizza.  Keep it authentic Joey's"}
{"text":"I used to live in the same apts I live in now, 10 years ago with my mom (I know, crazy!) and I remember ordering Joeys for all my sisters. Now 10 years later I'm ordering for My daughter and myself! Still the same GREAT quality. Classic Mom&Pop pizza joint close to home. Love it! 5 stars to Joeys."}
{"text":"Fast casual pizza dining concepts are the rage right now! Ive eaten a lot of pizza like most Americans, I'm sure. However this pizza is the best! Perfect crust, cheese is never to greasy. Chicken fingers are crisp and juicy. Usually pretty fast with delivery but their ranch is tangy and different and they usually never throw ketchup in the bag for the fries when asked..."}
{"text":"Horrible place, first of all we ordered a large pizza with Parmesan garlic wings and a 2 liter of soda, we  asked if the wings came wet or dry and the lady said wet so we got them. When we got the delivery, we got a very thin pizza with about 10 slices of pepperoni all around, and the wings were dry when we asked for wet and they smelled horrible. To top it all off we got 2 CANS of soda instead of a two liter soda, big difference. Horrible place, horrible customer service and horrible food. This place doesn't even deserve a start but it doesn't let me post this review without one selected!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Great prices. I love their cheesey bread. Very friendly people. I also like the Gyro sandwiches. Quick delivery service."}
{"text":"We had a cheese pizza, wings and fries delivered.  The pizza was awful, dry, overcooked.  The wings and fries were actually really good. Overall I regret the experience for the money spent."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. We had the thin crust and it was perfect. Not papery thin, not saltine cracker thin, just right thin. And cooked perfectly so the crust had a nice texture to it. We had three toppings and they too were just right. Obviously placed by hand with care so there was not clumps of olives in some places and no olives elsewhere. The ham was quality ham, placed so you got a piece in almost every bite. This one was delivered and the service was quick as could be expected. I'd order delivery again in a pinch, but there is just something about going out for your own. I like to get there a little early so I can have a beer while I'm waiting and make small talk with the help. And it's that kind of place, like it's your uncle slaving in front of the oven, maybe your cute cousin working the register. Just nice people trying to make an honest living giving people the kind of food they would serve their family. Not your huge, chain, production line pizza. that's for sure. Just honest quality for a fair price. They've been there for years and it's obvious why. Good...good....good, all the way around."}
{"text":"I hate to be a Negative Nancy but after all the positive reviews, I can't keep my opinion to myself.  I wouldn't even call this pizza \"good\".   I originally planned on using Domino's for my daughter's birthday party, but they've gone too far downhill.  We ordered from Joey's instead -- 4 pies and an order of garlic balls.

The crust was tough, not at all crispy, and somewhat hard to bite into.  I've had worse, but I do expect some kind of crispness.  On the good side, it didn't have that burnt flavor like so many of the other pizza shops in town.

Sauce had a good taste - somewhat sweet and not overloaded with spices.

The sausage was foul.  It was spoiled or freezerburnt or something along those lines.  All other toppings were tasty on their own, but there weren't a lot of them on the pizza.  Our bacon pizza had about 2 pieces of bacon per slice.  On the pizza with three different toppings, you couldn't get all three of those toppings in one bite.  It kinda defeats the purpose of getting a pizza with multiple toppings on it. 
 
Cheese was minimal.

We ordered the garlic balls thinking they would be similar to garlic knots.  They aren't anything like knots.  They tasted like pizza rolls but without the filling.  Not too bad, but they don't come with sauce, and they turned rubbery before the meal was over.  If there was a sauce, and if they didn't turn rubbery, they would've been a nice unique treat.  Kinda like fancy popcorn.  

I had my spouse order and pick up the food.  He was charged 20% more than the menu prices (afternoon, carryout).  Tax is only 8.x%.  He wasn't given an itemized receipt so I don't know why there was such a price difference.

I'm perfectly capable of making pizza or reheating one from the store.  The reason we order from a pizza place is to get pizza that tastes different (better) from the at-home options.  When the pizza doesn't taste better than at-home, it feels like a total waste.  All in all, I could've made a better pizza with a store brand Boboli crust.  Even the $1.25 frozen party pizzas would've tasted a lot better.

I should've known better than to try something new (for us) for a birthday party."}
{"text":"My sister and I were famished after doing some grocery shopping, so I recommended Joey's Pizza. We ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and buffalo chicken fingers. It didn't take long for the food to be prepared, which was made fresh. I'll have to come back again later."}
{"text":"Had the meat lovers. A little on the expensive side. Better than Domino's or the other chains, but that's not saying much. Delivery times are in the hour range. Will probably order again."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place due to all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed. The pizza was not good. It wasn't disgusting but not tasty at all. I think maybe it was the marinera sauce they use. Also, I oredered pepperoni and ham and got pinapple (bleh) and ham. I also ordered wings and they were ok. I did like the cheese bread, though. I'm wondering why everyone gave rave reviews... maybe I ordered the wrong pizza?"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, decent price. Called ahead for takeout and was quoted a 10 minute pickup. That's perfect for when you're hungry which I was. No frills, counter top with easy access for those who are on the go. Will definitely make it my new stop for when I don't want anything fancy just a good pizza."}
{"text":"This place has been under new ownership for awhile and it has been run down terrible prices terrible food terrible customer service the service is so bad here that I will never eat here again and recommend Napoli pizza, maestro' pizza, cafe Verdi, Angelina's pizza any pizza joint in the area other then this place"}
{"text":"Food is good & not just normal. There is a lot flavor in each bite. I have been going here for 8 years now & order the cheesey garlic bread sticks everytime"}
{"text":"My first time here and I liked it, I had the chicken fingers with fries, they were juicy, soft and chicken was very well cooked and trimmed. Fries were huge, very good portion. I also had pizza, it was also great, very decent amount of toppings, which other places sometimes lack. And finally I had a gyro with fries, it was good too, pita bread was super soft and so was meat. I will definitely get more food from this place again! I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and family that owns this pizza place. Have been a customer for over 8 years and will continue for more than that. Thanks so much for caring for my family like you have. They are more than just a pizza place. They genuinely care about their customers. We love you guys."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. They took 2 hours to deliver and after we cancelled it they refused to refund us. They were very rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"It's really difficult to actually find somewhere that delivers to where I live, not to mention how hard it is to find a place that has actual lamb gyro & not chicken/beef. Found this place under the \"Delivers\" section of Yelp & thought we'd give it a try. From the guy who answered, through the delivery guy everyone was super nice. The gyro meat was seasoned & really good! Only thing is next time we order we will be ordering extra meat on the sandwich because you get A LOT of pita & not much meat, but for $6 it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has great food. We moved in the area a few month ago and have ordered pizza, wings, knots, chicken strips and a ton of other things from here. They have fast delivery and awesome food. Most pizza places are the same. This place is way above average."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but if you are ordering delivery be forwarned. When we ordered we were double charged for our pizza, because of memorial day our bank has not reposted the funds back to our account. We called on tueday explaining the issue we were having, and were told to call back the next day if the money was not posted.  It wasn't, and we called back.  Only to be told that we will need to wait another day before the bank reposts our money. No before you think this is a banking issue, the entirity of this problem would have been avoided if they would have only run our card ONCE instead of twice (which they told us they were going to do because of a technical issue) .  I wish that we were on a budget that allowed us not care about 20 some dollars but the reality is, is that the money that is unavailable to us and not useable is causing alot of problems.  I won't be ordering from them again, I don't want to deal with this kind of stress.  My opinion, pizza is good but avoid delivery it's not worth the headache."}
{"text":"delivered- 15 minutes earlier than promised-awesome!
realizing that the door bell is ringing in the shower-not!
answering the door slightly wet in a towel- awesome- for him!
realizing I will never get a hot pizza delivery porno fantasy ever- not!
the pizza itself- awesome!
eating pizza alone, wet, and basically nakedl...well that is kinda awesome...right??"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!! Always on time and or early, whatever in the mood for.... They have a big selection and the service is a huge plus."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza spot! We always get a xtra large for pick up. It's a delicious New York style. The staff are very nice and efficient! The food is made relatively fast, so if you call you should definitely be there within the time it's made so it doesn't get cold! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Joeys on several occasions. They have a special we ALWAYS get & we add an additional pizza. The special is an XL pizza w/ 2 toppings 20 wings & 8 fingers for $29.99...we have ALWAYS asked for all wings & no fingers, they have always given us 40 wings total & no fingers. We have ordered this special at least 3 times in the last 2 months. We call today to get the same thing, they say they can't do that. When I explained I've done it before, the girl says she'll ask the manager, she yells to someone else & then a guy gets on the phone & tells me there is a new owner & they no longer make substitutions. I ask that there is a new owner in the last 2 weeks? He asks \"you got that special in the last 2 weeks?\" I said yes. He tells me I was lucky. He says the owner has put something in the computer that doesn't allow them to override & it would charge a higher rate. If that's true, then how did I get the deal less then 2 weeks prior? The pizza is decent & honestly the wings are under seasoned & we usually add seasoning when we get them. We continued to order because they were convenient & the chicken was always cooked right, not under cooked or over cooked, but they do charge too much. Our last order was over $50 for 2 pizzas, 40 wings & a 2 liter of pepsi which the driver had to go back & get because he forgot it. The customer service today was terrible & very unprofessional. The guy that got on the phone was argumentative. We won't be ordering from here again due to poor customer service alone. AND by the way, there is NOTHING on the menu that says NO SUBSTITUTIONS."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from Joey's for at least 15 years. For a long time the biggest downfall was price and that they didn't deliver. Well, now the prices for all pizza has gone up to match their prices and they started delivering! So as a consequence, we as a household order from them probably every few weeks, they probably know our dogs by now.  I haven't explored too much on their menu; we generally stick to an XL with pepperoni and black olive with some ranch (we're Las Vegas natives, we rock that ranch and pizza combo :P) and gotta say, whatever supplier they use for their ranch is a good choice. But even the basic sauce is really tasty and garlic-y and they make the toppings worth the price. 
Pros 
 Super tasty and a great size, XL is good to feed about 3-4 adults depending on appetite 
 Fast delivery generally 
 Friendly 
 Consistent and reheats in an oven well 

Cons 
 Antipasta salad is pretty much just lunch meat on a bed of lettuce; it's good lunch meat just not what I was expecting 

All in all, I  Joey's Pizza; my favorite pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've heard some of my friends who live near this Joey's go on for sometime about how they order from Joey's and like it. They also eat Little Caesars often, so I should have realized their pizza game was off. I've actually had far better and acceptable pizzas from LC before compared to what I had here from Joey's. Almost $30 later we had a Pepperoni Pizza, order of fries and an order of chicken fingers. The fries were a joke! The portion of fries was small for what they said \"could feed a family of four\" and they lacked potato filling it was like eating flat, hard fries. The chicken fingers were nothing more than the same frozen chicken fingers you'd get in a fast food kids meal and they weren't even warm when I opened the box to grab one. The pizza was a huge disappointment with pepperoni unevenly placed on the top, having one side so-so and the other side with very few pepperoni on it. Maybe it all slid to one side during baking I have no idea. The sauce was lacking flavor and the amount of grease this pizza had was just disgusting. The pizza box was filled with grease soaked through as well my plate that had pizza on it. The pizza was so soggy and flopped right away when picking up a slice. I felt the whole meal was a waste of money and can't see coming back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrible. First they forgot our pizza and then they messed up all the toppings. We ordered wings, fries, and pizza. The delivery woman then only brought the wings and fries, after we told her she went and got the pizza for us (which was very sweet.) When we received the pizza it had only two of the 4 toppings we had ordered, and the taste wasn't even good. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! Owner and staff is amazing. The pizza sauce is out of this world! Everything we have ever ordered from there has been amazing. Great pick up deals. Always a treat! Try the cheese bread; you will not be sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"This is another place that yelp didn't fail us at all! 

We were going to go for lunch, but wanted to sit down so we decided not to go, that is the only problem with this place, not seating. 

After reading the reviews again we decided to go ahead and do take out, I must say this was not a mistake. The Joey's special pizza was great, the best pizza so far here in Las Vegas that I have had. Even more amazing was the fact that just the plain pizza also looked and tasted excellent, the fresh ingredients are all very good. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to for pizza and fingers...huge salads and excellent burgers! Lasagna is great but spaghetti is just ok.  Delivery is always super fast and everything is always super hot."}
{"text":"They said that food would be ready in 30 minutes. ..which they are really good about...but it's now been 50 minutes and our chicken wings are still cooking. I ordered the family pack deal #2....it's 12:30 pm and they were out of chicken wings and couldn't complete my order. I told the girl to substitute it with some chicken fingers and the girl said it would cost more. Very young and inexperienced people working here at this hour with no customer service skills. While standing here waiting patiently for my order....another gentleman came in for his order, and the girl told him that they are waiting for cheese to cook his pizza so his food will be awhile. Why open today if you have no food???"}
{"text":"My problem is that this hole in the wall place is way over priced it ridiculous that you can charge 20 dollars for chicken fingers get the fuck out of here, very horrible prices I'm not a happy costumer!!!!!! The pizza isn't bad but really you don't even have a dine in come on get it together already"}
{"text":"Boyfriend order the 6 piece chicken wings they are HUGE!!!!!!!!!! he's not the skinniest guy but said next time the 3 piece only it should come with 2 ranches at least with the piece though.  I on the other hand got a cheeseburger actually quite tasty would order it again if I felt lazy and didn't want to cook dinner. Either you like this place or you don't I have had good experiences though . I probably wouldn't order a pizza from the looks of the other reviews though...."}
{"text":"My boss asked me to order the office pizza. Phone service was great that's deserved +1 start they delivered fairly quick another star +1 for taste is +1 star quality of food ahhh, pizza was falling apart before it got to my plate it was not cut properly.  It looks like a disaster on my plate. Maybe it was just my luck. My boss wasn't so happy with me, but he still ate the food."}
{"text":"Pizza was burnt and tasted weird. Never ordering pizza here again. Shame on you for even putting that pizza in the box telling yourself that it was worthy of being delivered. The wings were good."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in vegas hands down service like you're family water just a great place this is the best and only pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings, and steak fries!!! I lve this place! We just moved into town and didn't know where to go for great pizza at a good price, and its not like we just want cheap pizza lol we've had expensive crappy pizza, just say 'n... the crust is perfect it's not super thin or thick it's just right. They have excellent service too! Everyone who we've ordered from is really cool and the owner seems really sweet. It's not a dine in type of place but it's totally worth it!!! Delivery is usually 45 min which is the usually the norm. So glad we found this place! :D"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and calzones...Called in my order, and when I arrived, everything was ready and hot.  Prices are really good so I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"An Adventure!

Best pizza I've had in town! And getting there was half the adventure, the rest was my gps going berserk and spitting me out on the other side of town.

But that's not what this review is about!

Ordered Joey's Famous Home Run, but I had it reheated after my temporary navigational fail and it still tasted great and fresh! (with some lightly burnt parts)

That garlic alfredo sauce really hits the spot and the cheddar cheese adds a great flavor! It'd be boring if it was only mozarella right? The entire pizza combination compliments itself!

Great value for money since their prices already factor in the taxes, you're getting more taste for your dollar! 

Definitely going to try more combinations, when the urge for cheese strikes again!"}
{"text":"Food was not warm, wings were not tossed, and the peppers on our pizza were raw. Will not be ordering again"}
{"text":"Joey's pizza is thin, hot delicious stuff that always makes my mouth water at the sight of it. It's consistent, fresh, and flavorful. 

Not the best pizza I've ever had - but good enough to make me and my husband pick some up every time we're in the area. The point at which price meets flavor hits the spot - easy on my wallet and yummy in my tummy. 

They have great wings, averagely delicious chicken fingers, and I can honestly say it's the only place my stingy husband will actually purchase ranch dressing on the side.

My family and I are fans of Joey's Pizza."}
{"text":"The parking lot is SCARY and packed from the bar nearby at night. This shop felt that anchovies were a premium $4 topping; unheard of. You get the feeling it's a business that's on it's last legs and desperate to nickel and dime you with inconsistent and unmarked changes to prices and added fees. Too many pizza places in town to settle on Joey's."}
{"text":"I ordered mushrooms, olives, and sausage....I had a hard time finding any mushrooms and sausage.  Might as well went to Little Caesars and got a cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be giving Joey's Pizza more stars, but based on my husband and I going out of our way to \"try something different\" - that different did not turn out so great.

I've had this place bookmarked because of the good reviews and proximity to my home. There's not a lot on the East Side worth going out of your way for, but some things are really diamonds in the rough. Joey's is not.

Ordered three medium pizzas for $21.99 for take-out. The girl on the phone took my order and repeated it back to me.

1 Pizza with hamburger topping
1 Pizza with ham and mushrooms
1 Pizza with pepperoni and jalepenos

We got two pizzas correct and the other came as a HAWAIIAN pizza. They put pineapples and ham instead of ham and mushrooms. Okay, it's an honest mistake, but I've ordered this type of pizza from Marco's, Domino's, Metro, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers, and never have any of them eff;d it up. 

Maybe I could over look the wrong pizza, but then when it comes down to it, the pizzas were just \"meh\". The cheese was boring, no diversity, just straight out mozzarella, and gooey-gross messy. The first time around it was okay, heated up the next day it was particularly yucky.

Also - I got a bad stomach problem that night and woke up *ahem* having to go to the restroom. I spent the rest of the night in and out. I decided it must have been the pizza, but my husband did not get sick. Then I decided to experiment and took all the pepperoni and jalapenos off the pizza I ate and had it sans-toppings. I did not get tummy trouble after that.

Who knows - the sickness may have been something else I ate, but considering the meh quality, the wrong pizza, and my late-night bathroom ventures, I will not be ordering from Joey's Pizza again."}
{"text":"Always got pizza hut or dominos .wanted something different and found this online . I gotta say the pizza was great and the wings were awesome . you pay a little more than the franchise guys but its worth it"}
{"text":"Called to order one of there specials they said they had no chicken fingers I asked if we could get more wings I stead they said no. We go here all the time are you kidding me horrible customer service... Will not be going here anymore.. Bunch of jerks..."}
{"text":"The people are nice enough. But, the sauce just wasnt very good and the pizza was soggy.
Everything's frozen, the veggies, the meats, probably the dough. 
I just moved into the neighborhood and was hoping for a good local pizza spot. This ain't it"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Joey's pizza for over 9 years best pizza ever they're always on time and always so friendly"}
{"text":"The pizza is so-so. We have had some minor hiccups in that area, very minor. But....the stromboli. In a word, outstanding. This bad boy is bigger than my forearm. I highly recommend the Classic. Filled to exploding with pepperoni, ham, mozzarella AND cheddar...and sauce! If you love stromboli, this does not disappoint. If this were featured in \"The Godfather\" instead of canolli, there would have been a gunfight over this baby!"}
{"text":"I went to joeys on nellis and order a 10 inch ground beef and pineapple pizza and wings and it was great. The taste was so fresh and had a homemade taste to it. I love joeys and would recommend it to all the pizza lovers in las vegas nv"}
{"text":"Delicious GARLIC pizza! Cheese bread is BOMB. Wings were good.
I tend to grab food here when I'm pulling a late night night of karaoke at Saddles & Spurs... LOL!"}
{"text":"I love this place the white sauce is great!!! I am trying the Super Deal tonight Hope I love it just the same!!"}
{"text":"Apparently the folks at Joey's Pizza can not read the signs displayed around the Stallion Mountain community that clearly state that solicitation is not allowed.  Furthermore shoving your menu through our front door setting off our canine alarm system was very unappreciated (although it was good proof of its effectiveness).  

Your menu went immediately into the trash and now we will never patronize your establishment no matter how good your pizza appears to be."}
{"text":"The food here never disappoints. It's always hot, fresh, and delicious. The pizza is great. My sister and I recently discovered this place and we always order from here now. The staff is friendly and prepares your order fast. The prices are really good too!"}
{"text":"This is the first time ordering from here, and I will definitely be ordering from here again. NY style pizza and awesome wings!"}
{"text":"We are the food so fast couldn't get a pick I been eatin here since 2010 !!! But this was my 1st time trying the Philly cheesesteak & omg shit it's only 8pm ima be straight till tomorrow afternoon!!! Shoutout to the cheap delivery charge only $3"}
{"text":"Bad management, place has been losing business for a while. I recommend eating somewhere else. Place looks dirty like it's not cleaned properly."}
{"text":"Today was the first time ordering from this place and let me tell you....the food was very YUMMY!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try the burger and fries combo here.  The burger was pretty small and the fries were just average.  I like the burgers better at Angelina's much better.  Actually I feel they have one of the best burgers on the East Side of town.  But, I digress as this is a review of Joey's.  The pizza here is still my favorite though.  And, they have a yelp check in deal which saves you 10% on your bill.  So, that is a bonus."}
{"text":"we order from here all the time. yesterday we ordered a Vegetarian and a Joeys Deluxe. 45.00 worth of pizza! i called to complain that it was terrible, no cheese, no veggies, no meat, NOT worth the money! lousy customer service, i even offered to take a pic of the awful pizza send to her, it was so bad! she said Manager would call me back! dont bother
LAST TIME JOEYS GETS MY MONEY! BEWARE"}
{"text":"When I bought my mass amount of restaurant.com certificates when I first moved here, I didn't really pay attention to location.  So I sent my husband out to get pizza here for us and use a certificate, and he yelled at me later because it was so far.  

The pizza was pretty good.  I had a vegetarian with anchovies, thin crust.  It was good but nothing special, really.  What was better was my husband's thick crust pepperoni.  Very very good crust, but bad for me because I should be limiting my carbs.  We needed to make a $45 minimum so we got some hot wings too.  Flavor wise, they were good but lacked the crunchiness I love in a good hot wing. 

Husband said when he got to the restaurant there was literally one guy there doing everything (cooking, taking orders, etc) and he tipped him quite a bit.  With our certificate we only paid 20 bucks for our two large pizzas and an order of wings, which was a pretty good deal.

Would we go out of our way to go here?  Probably not.  But if I lived near here I'd definitely be ordering delivery."}
{"text":"This pizza was way below average and way too high priced.  Figured I'd be safe with a white pizza but nope, oily as hell and the mozzarella sticks were barely  cooked the sauce was refrigerator cold. I will never attempt to eat here again and will steer everyone I  know away. If this is what vegas has to offer for pizza ill wait til my next city to order more! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Drove here in Sunday 9/3/17. Yelp hours says open until 10pm. Arrived at 7:50, sign said OPEN, but when we got to the door it was locked and the people inside looked at us and just shook their heads no, then they turned off all lights. So frustrated! Just wanted some good pizza! Waaah. Please adjust business hours posted."}
{"text":"Just moved closer to this restaurant.. and four times we have ordered. The staff not only remembers my home and address but is friendly.

Bottom line, when I order pizza I expect a good hot pie delivered to my home in a reasonable amount of time. Consistently they take about 25 min to 32 min for delivery. THAT is AWESOME!

Food is delivered as ordered, with fresh toppings and crisp salad. Love this place"}
{"text":"Coming from NY, it's hard to find edible pizza out here BUT the pizza at this place was really very bad.  My order was one extra-large cheese pie and one extra-large pepperoni pie.  The pies were basically large, not extra-large.  I'm fairly sure they use MSG, plenty of garlic powder and/or other chemical food enhancers.  I know it's cheaper this way but those of us who can tell the difference between real and fake are not being fooled!  Plus the instant headache that sets in five-ten minutes after eating is a dead giveaway!  It's too bad because this is on my way home from work and I would have liked to return but there's no way I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thanks for delivering the day before Thanksgiving and being prompt. 

I wish the crust wasn't dry and you gave us the ranch dressing we paid for. Or anything like Parmesan cheese..."}
{"text":"Mexican Pizza is to die for. I love it!!!! Super fast delivery and great service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Be careful when you go to this pizza joint. I've gone there quite a bit since I've been here, so I know the prices pretty well. Yesterday I called in a order and had the person(I believe it's the owners spouse) tried to over charge me by 6.00. when I complained she had the nerve to get angry with me and hung up the phone. I politely called back and let her know that I would never come in her establishment ever again."}
