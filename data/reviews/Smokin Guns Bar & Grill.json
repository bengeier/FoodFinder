{"text":"I find the other review of the food to be inaccurate. I have eaten the grilled chicken sandwich (and wrap) and find it to be among the best I've ever eaten. Very moist and tasty. The lounge owner is concerned with their food and strives to make it better than average. They even have home made potato chips that are great. The place has only been open a few months so maybe the other reviewer experienced a bad night during growing pains of new staff or of just opening. I've eaten there quite a few times and been very satisfied. One thing that impressed me was the owner will go overboard to make a customer happy (if you give him a chance). I will go back!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel, attached to this bar , for business and stopped in for a few drinks later at night.. OHHH WOW!  did we step into the twilight zone!  There must have been a trailer park convention nearby because it seemed like every piece of  trash was in there, getting drunk off their asses!!    You had losers ,thinking they were cool ,burning rubber with their so called suped up cars in the parking lot, . Alot of overweight, unattractive girls chugging down beers WHILE smoking a cigarette... at the same time no less,,lol, Oh,  sorry guys but it looked like most of them were taken cause they were hanging out with their skinny, beer belly, boyfriends/cousins.And, to top it all off, there was a big ass fight!  The only thing missing from this hillbilly rodeo would have been a guy with coke bottle glasses, dancing and playing his spoons ,SIMULTANEOUSLY, to music!...   oh wait a minute,,, I take that back,  there WAS a guy doing that!! Anyway, the only positive thing to say about this place is that the bartenders and staff  were very nice and attentive despite having to tolerate with this crappy element.  What happened..thought Cornelius was a nice, rich classy town!?  Well. guess it still is, except for this place!"}
{"text":"We love to shag dance here on Friday nights when we can.  The wait staff is very nice and patient.  The PBRs are on $1.50.  (thus the two stars) The food is typical \"bar food\" but of lower quality than most.  I've had the grilled chicken salad and was absolutely surprised that the lettuce was only the iceberg variety; very little chicken, two halves of a cherry tomato; and some white onions that matched the lettuce.  Another time I had the grilled chicken wrap which consisted of a lot of wrap, maybe 3 thin ribbons of chicken, 1 small slice of tomato and a BUNCH of iceberg lettuce!   So we will continue to go there to shag but will most likely go to another restaurant around there before we arrive."}
