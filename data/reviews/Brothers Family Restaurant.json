{"text":"I have been bringing my family here for some time now. Really excited about the remodeling as it's nicer. It's really great home cooked meals but every time I come I get disappointed that they don't serve grits on the menu . Service is always great and nice people 

Please add grits to menu !!!!"}
{"text":"Great old fashioned diner-themed joint with home cooked tasting food for good pricing. I always feel like there is more than enough food and TBH if you wanted to share one meal or maybe share fries, you probably could. I guess that's depending on the person but...
Pretty packed on a Saturday for brunch so be conscience of that, and the parking is ridiculous so that part is no fun. But once you're in you're seated fairly quickly and the food is delicious. Lots of smiling wait staff."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and gyro! Haven't had anything else yet. They have great service and a nice patio for us smokers :-)  Expect a wait for breakfast Saturday and Sunday!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. Great prices, great service and amazing food. Recently remodeled inside and out. Just looks clean and new."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch (have not tried breakfast and do not know if they are open for dinner).  I go here for their turkey club.  The sandwich is thick and great.  Then they stack some great fries on top of the sandwich slices.  Usually eat half and take home half.  Food tastes great.  Prices are great.  And, if you are into it, their pies are great too.  Usually have Donna as our waitress.  She is friendly and makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"My wife and I have breakfast here every Sunday after church. The food is AMAZING for the price !  The Chicken Fried Steak is over the top - egss are fixed properly - the service is excellent from the time the \"boys\" greet you at the front door until you leave. What a wonderful family place ! Best breakfast spot in the Peoria area !

{"text":"Great service, good food! Don't stack plates on top of my breakfast! Ew! And please move the register or find a way to check out that is not by the door."}
{"text":"We love to come here with our family!  My husband loves the country skillet, and my little girl likes get one single meatball.  I've skipped around on the menu, but I appreciate their burgers with lots of fresh onion.

We like being able to support a local business, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Peoria, it's homemade style, friendly staff, fresh and delicious menu, keeps us coming back. Maureen sure is our favorite waitress, ask for her! Very welcoming every time, love bringing the whole family here."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have been House hunting in Sun City. We had noticed this Restaurant in the past. We decided to stop and have Lunch. We were so disappointed. We both ordered Hamburgers. They told us the french fries did not come with it. So we both ordered fries. 

The fries came out on 1 plate. Soggy and Sad looking. Not many for being two orders.

The Hamburgers were dry and over cooked. 

We did not get a refill on drinks: coffee for husband and soda for me.
They didn't even check back to see how we were doing, or how things were.

We will not be back and will never recommend them..."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my husband and ordered the cod dinner. The food was excellent. We had a great waitress. Service was prompt and the price was good. I would recommend it if you are looking for a casual spot for a quick dinner out. We will be back."}
{"text":"My number one stop for breakfast, homemade taste , good price , always friendly , 

French toast , eggs and home fries my favorite"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice place to grab a good sandwich. The clientele seems to be mostly the older crowd, but so be it. We ordered salad (om nom), patty melt (the best we've had anywhere), and a philly cheese steak (not as tender as I'd like, but still very good; I'm picky).

Atmosphere is very laid-back, cozy, and there's a smoking section on the patio. Booths feel private. Waiters/waitresses were all attentive, but didn't go overboard. 

We'll totally be back. Looks like we need to try the breakfast food next time, from what these reviews say. :o"}
{"text":"I've have gotten breakfast here quite a few times through door dash so I cannot comment on anything except the food! On that note , It's always cooked perfectly . My daughter got pancakes and they were HUGE! I most recently ordered the French toast, and my god ! I was in heaven"}
{"text":"A decent place to meet family for a low-key meal. Good food, okay service, lots of options."}
{"text":"For the price... it's not bad. The service was fine yet nothing spectacular.

Drinks?
Order?
Delivery...eat..Bill... Walk to the counter and pay...  That's about how it went.

I've been here twice now and have no idea what the servers name is as she hadn't told me (same server twice...) while not a big deal its still nice to talk to your server when the restaurant isn't very busy.

The food is average at best the burrito I had the second go 'round was huge... but greasy from the flattop.

For the price though, you could do worse...much worse."}
{"text":"Thanks, but no thanks. 

We've driven by this place on multiple occasions and on my boyfriend's insistence that we give it a try, we finally did. 

First impression, the crowd of elderly people was not encouraging, but we went inside and several tables were filled (and more were empty). We were instantly greeted by a young man, who was very nice and sat us in a booth. Two seconds later coffee was being poured into the mugs already on the table by our waitress, and a guy came and plopped water glasses down without a word and walked away. 

The menu is sort of all over the place with pictures and bright colors (which didn't do the food any favors). That in itself made it difficult to order since I had a preview of what I was in for. Nonetheless I tried to ignore them and I ordered a #7 which was supposed to be an egg scramble with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, bacon, and feta, accompanied by toast and home fries. My boyfriend got 2 eggs over medium with biscuits and gravy. 

Shortly after ordering our food arrived. It did not look great and upon trying to stick a fork in mine I noticed the general lack of egg. There were peppers, there were mushrooms, there were onions, bacon galore, feta to be sure, but where were those pesky eggs? Apparently they are with Waldo in the kitchen. The \"home fries\".. Lets face it, they were hot nothing. No butter, no onions, no salt, no pepper, just what seemed like sliced boiled potatoes. Even Samwise would have avoided putting these in his stew. 

I didn't try them, but my bf said the gravy was tasteless and his over medium eggs were cooked well. 

The two young men chatting up front are whom I can only assume are the \"brothers\". They were very friendly in their designer jeans, but perhaps if they returned them they could afford a cohesive menu with food in their food. I mean, shouldn't there be eggs in an egg scramble? Perhaps next time we drive by ill pop in and give them a few eggs from my backyard chickens so they can avoid future embarrassment."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place
 Good food and great neighborhood feel.
Worthy of my continued business."}
{"text":"Terrible, unfriendly service. Food took at least 40 minutes (ordered 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast). Never got my drink refilled or asked how my meal was. Good was mediocre at best... And how can you mess up an order so simple? I will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Turkey is dry fries are soggy taste like cafeteria food from  elementary school will never be going back"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, but food was lackluster.  The biscuits were dry and crumbly and the crepes were bland and the filling tasted like it was out of a can. It's too bad, cause if the food matches the service, it would have been easily 5 stars."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was horrible. I had a chicken sandwich with a side salad. The salad looked like it was swimming in a pool of Ranch dressing and the salad itself looked old. The chicken sandwich was plain."}
{"text":"We have been going here since we moved to this suffer of town.  Great food, fast and friendly service. This is the place to go if you want a fast fresh home-cooked breakfast.  We will continue to frequent Brother's and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I like this place. My husband and I like to eat at places that aren't chains and this is one that we've been to a few times.  I feel like the prices could be a bit lower but the food is pretty darn good so its worth it to stop in if you are in the area. Especially if you live in Peoria."}
{"text":"Mother's Day was our first time coming here. Good food and pleasant atmosphere. The waitress that attended to us was really friendly and very helpful. Thank you for the great experience and I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"My grandpa and I went here for brunch, searching for something other than Denny's. This place was very comfortable with lovely decor. Staff was very, very nice, Jeri was our waitress. You can tell this is a place has a lot of regulars. The menu has an excellent selection for any time of the day. I think I'll be back tomorrow to try the Brother's delight sandwich. They serve a good amount of food for the price you pay also."}
{"text":"Place was okay nothing special...typical breakfast. Server was nice which kind of made up for the mediocre food. Go to Denny's or IHOP cause you'll probably pay less and have more variety of food to choose."}
{"text":"It was busy but we were seated right away.  The waitress was prompt and courteous.  She returned several times for coffee refills.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  It was average as most cfs dishes are. (Hard to find a really good one).  I like that it just seems like a small town cafe.  I will be back for another dish."}
{"text":"Excellent family restaurant in downtown Peoria! My grilled salmon salad was simply delicious! All in our party of four enjoyed dining here!"}
{"text":"This place was really bad today. Took about 45 minutes to get our food. Asked for well done ham and it came out barely cooked and the potatoes were borderline raw. Food stayed on tables outside during most of our visit, which meant birds were hovering constantly. Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and a VERY clean restaurant. First time here and really enjoyed it. The Gyro and Fries were fantastic.

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This modernization restaurant is downtown Peoria. The staff was amazing and patient. It was slow start around 8, not packed at all. I ordered the Mexican omelette, potatoes, and tortilla. The salsa it came with had lots of flavor and perfect. The side of pancakes was a little on the rubbery side and not so fluffy. They didn't have enough condiment bottles, sharing is caring. Over all the flavors and staff made my breakfast satisfying."}
{"text":"Good food except the biscuit was not good at all in our opinion; very dry and no substance. The staff that we encountered was kind and welcoming. Nice place!"}
{"text":"In town from Chicago and wanted a good family restaurant for Breakfast. We were not disappointed! The Chorizo skillet had green peppers, onions, tomatoes and cheese and came with the option of a delicious big, warm tortilla instead of toast. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food, is okay, service is okay. Everything is just okay. Sometime that's okay but sometimes you want more. If you happen to want an okay meal and you okay with that you should come here and that's perfectly okay, you know. If you want extra you should probably go elsewhere but it's a calm relaxing environment, I feel like they should do something about the restaurants smell, you can still smell the cigarette smoke from the half that you used to be able to smoke on. Kinda disgusting if you ask me."}
{"text":"The food served at this establishment is fair at best,  I am not giving this place a good review except for the following...
They sell a selection of home made pies that is out of this world!!!  Chocolate Cream, Peanut butter, Coconut Cream, etc.  Believe me, you won't find better pie anywhere! They would be better off shutting down the restaurant and opening up as a bakery!
There is a server there named Kelly! Someone that owns a really good restaurant should try to snap her up, as she is an excellent server with an awesome personality, a big smile, remembers your name and what you order!  Very skilled at her job!"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant here. It has been years since I came to this place and it has changed quite a bit. The outside looks nice and so does the inside. Lots of booths, which I love, and tons of seating. They have a large array of items on the menu including things from breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are just a handful of items that at time based. Prices seem pretty reasonable. Nothing to crazy. They hand write your receipt and makes it feel like an old school dinner.

Service was good. We were able to order and get our food in a timely manner and the waitress checked on us regularly.

I was surprised to find that my breakfast burrito was really good. The salad was good too! I came in with the wrong expectation and ended up being a fan.

Overall, it's a nice place, come and check it out!"}
{"text":"Very friendly restaurant. Initially I felt uncomfortable due to not being from the area and some personal assumptions but immediately the staff made me feel warm. The food is awesome! Even the customers were friendly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time they have been super friendly. They have always gotten the order correct. They serve a good selection of food from American to Mexican to Greek. They have staff that speak Spanish. The restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!! I found this place by accident. I am very pleased with the service and food.  Our waitresses name was Kelly. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place because of its character and because they do serve good food and have friendly service. It has been around for a long while and many people enjoy it's neighborhood diner environment. So if you want to stick your nose up to the largely populated elderly clientele or lack of five star food shame on you. You're expecting too much of the wrong thing and lack appreciation for what it's known for. 

I do not consider myself bias as I have only been here a handful of times and therefor have no special ties. Though I've been here all my life and have known plenty of people who enjoy the establishment and consider it a sentimental part of Peoria. However the times I did dine here, all for breakfast, I was very pleased and left more than satisfied. If you're hungry for breakfast and are stuck on the generic Denny's or IHOP, venture out and try Brothers. Just remember it's a diner and not Ruth Chris steakhouse so you should know what to expect."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Brothers for many years and never had a bad meal until tonight.  They've been out of gyro meat for over two days, Philly cheese sandwich wasn't any good,. Also had a NY steak special, meat was cooked good but was tough, mixed vegetables didn't have a good taste and the baked potato was luke warm wouldn't melt the butter."}
{"text":"I flew into Arizona last Saturday morning to have a weekend with my Girlfriend.  After our date night on Saturday, Sunday morning we came here to have breakfast.  My girlfriend loves their food and this was my first time.  Please note, that my review is solely based on my experience and it total is based on the customer service provided.  The food itself was hometown, comfort, very delicious food!  The customer service in general is another story!

First off, our food took forever to get served.  I am not sure what was wrong but we did wait an extensive time for a breakfast burrito.

Secondly, there were members of the staff which just seemed miserable.

The owner was pointed out to me with a mention that you only ever see her sitting there eating.  As Management and a \"Family\" restraunt it would be nice to see her maybe looking happier and mingling with the guests / patrons.

All in all, the food really was very good.  However, their customer service and that of the owner could be much improved upon."}
{"text":"I was here Friday May 9th 2014. This is one of those place you can tell from the moment you walk in the door has a very cheap owner who takes no pride in ownership. From the old cracked celling tiles to the cheap art on the walls to the food (more on that later) to the old cheap broken down equipment behind the counter. The bathroom was gross dirty and smelled terrible! It's a seat yourself type of place so we saunter over to a booth and wait for someone to come check on us. 5 minutes go by and no one has check on us. So I walk up to the cash register and ask if we could get some service and I get a major attitude from the lady sitting back there. Before I could get back to my seat a nice woman was dropping off menus and taking our drink orders and saying how sorry she was about the delay. Fair enough things happen and she was very friendly! I order a coke and water with lemon and my friend orders an iced tea with lemon. When we get our drinks the 1st thing we both notice is the brown spots on the lemons. When we ask about fresh lemons she says they all pretty much look like that. So my friend ordered the burger and the waitress asked if he wanted French fries and he said yes. I ordered the grilled salmon with a salad fries and veggis. When the waitress brought me my salad I though it was a joke. GROSS GROSS GROSS! The lettuce was wilted and the tomato looked freeze dried. I could not believe that this was what passed for a salad around this place!!!! I mean the lettuce was seriously BROWN!!! UGH! I ask if they maybe had something fresher and she said that this is how the lettuce looked! OMG! REALLY?!?!? God I still can't believe it! So here comes our meal. My salmon was dry and bland! My friends was about on par with one you'd get from McDonalds. Nothing real bad just not something homemade. Then the bill comes. There was a charge for my friends fries. Who the hell sells a hamburger A la carte?
So over all we were not impressed with any of it! The waitress was friendly and kept our drinks refilled so that was good. It's just one of those places you can tell the owner wants to do things as cheap a possible and is not worried about quality! I really hate to say this because I love to support local businesses but just do yourself a favor and go to the Denny's on Grand."}
{"text":"If u want a honest review from someone on the outside looking in and not these locals praising the place look no further. Went for breakfast, service was good above average... food was ahhh ok nothing above average jus a typical breakfast.. probably better for dinner.. they need blueberry pancakes that actually have blue berries in the batter instead of pie filling out a can dumped on top and spayed with whip cream. so if I could some this up in one word \"Overrated\" period  home fries were bland and had no seasoning what so ever another word I would use is \"Generic\" AF"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for brunch one day.

Star 1: The food I got was surprisingly much better than I thought it would be. I got a patty melt that was a special and it was super tasty. My wife got French toast and thought it was really good. She didn't like the sausage much though.

Star 2: The service was pretty good.

Star 3: The atmosphere was a nice diner-style environment.

Star 4: The food was well worth the price! I got the party melt and fries that came with dessert and I think a salad. It was only like 7 or 8 bucks I think, maybe 9.

Star 5: The wow factor for this one is that my burger was much better than I expected it to be. It was fresh, juicy, and packed full of flavor."}
{"text":"Been here a few times,however today we went in, the man at the door looked like he needed a shower,he did not greet us and then tossed out menus on the table.If it's to much of a bother to greet your customers then I for one will spend my money elsewhere.The food is not good enough to warrant staying after that non- greeting."}
{"text":"Kicking it Old School

Awesome diet plate ( stuffed tomato salad) sliced egg, cottage cheese and pineapple with fruit...
It's just like my mom used to order in 1968..when she was on a diet. 
It's great. Really...It's what we SHOULD eat. 
Sure, the tomato is a little pale and the chicken salad is a little bland ...But, if it were \"Organo-farm-to -table-fancy-schmancy...it wouldn't be truly old school."}
{"text":"Spent time in Peoria and had a pretty miserable experience overall due to customer service, but that all changed Saturday morning. Walked into the restaurant and were seated immediately, and Liz, our server was right there to take our drink order. Servers were always checking in on us, and they joked, and laughed, and made suggestions to help us keep our bill down. Which wasn't hard, there were three of us, and we each had the days special, pancakes, or french toast, eggs, and bacon or sausage. We had 2 coffees, one OJ, and I ordered hashbrowns. The meal ran about $21, then there was the tip. The food was good breakfast food,  but the service was  made the morning. Liz came over and joked with us, chatted with us, and was very attentive and friendly. If we find our way back to Peoria, this restaurant will certainly be part of our trip."}
{"text":"Great place to run into for a bite to eat, customer service is amazing and the food is just like a normal diner but must say it had good taste."}
{"text":"Totally wrote a review the wrong place never been here but I'm sure it's great. Might have to stop by soon."}
{"text":"Service was good food was bland. Used to eat here a lot buts it's been a couple years since. The fried chicken had no flavor and was dry. Green pork burrito was also bland the beans were very dry tasted old and like they been sitting all day. Very disappointing and did not enjoy it at all."}
{"text":"Average is the best word to describe Brothers. It isn't necessarily a bad thing. The food was okay. The service was okay. The prices were good. Nothing really stood out as great but on the other hand there was nothing that stood out as bad. 

I'll stick with average and I'll more than likely give them another try sometime..."}
{"text":"Love this place ! My favorite hometown place to eat. Always great service,and good food!!!"}
{"text":"It's Thursday and that means \"Spaghetti Day\" at one of my favorite establishments of all, Brothers Family Restaurant in Peoria.  I will drive out of my way on this day because spaghetti & meatballs are made special.  The sauce and meatballs are made fresh and to die for.  You absolutely cannot find anything better.  Jeri greets me with a warm and friendly smile and says I know why your here and prepares a great big salad to start.  Out comes my order, hot and ready, with 4 tender delicious meatballs.  Jeri says \"enjoy\".  Boy oh boy, did I ever.  Thanks Jeri and Brother's.  I'm happy."}
{"text":"I grew up in Peoria & had come to Brothers as a kid. Now 20 years later my hisband & I moved back to the old stomping grounds & I really wanted him to try Brothers. I am being very generous by giving them a four star review & only did so for the older gentlemen that went around the tables pouring coffee. We never once had an empty cup & he was so sweet. As for our server.... she never greeted us or made eye contact w/ us, or smiled, or thanked us or even seemed to acknowledge we were there. I wish the food would've made up for it. I got the breakfast burrito & after the 3rd bite realized there was something funky tasting inside. I couldnt pin point it but it was not good. Bad ham? Eggs? Something tasted like it was rotten so I coundnt eat the rest. It was a shame, I really wanted this to be our new weekly breakfast joint. At least the prices are cheap."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it is a great place for dinner and breakfast.  always FRIENDLY  PEOPLE THAT take great care of you.       Will be a customer here and continue to for years to come.   Lettie is a real sweetheart.  always  makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"The Kind of Place You Want To Bring A Book or Newspaper to and Just Eat and Relax

The valley is filled with places to pick up breakfast. There are the typical doughnut and bagel shops to the sit-down chain restaurants. However, once in a while, if your lucky, you come across that one neighborhood place that turns out to be a \"stand-out spot\".  You know what I mean, the place that everyone flocks to.  Well that place happens to be Brothers Family Restaurant!

Today was my first visit to Brothers Family Restaurant and all I can say is, it won't be my last. Brothers is clean, the staff is friendly, the service is fast, the food is  very tasty, perfectly made and did I mention great prices.

Brothers has one of the best family style menus around, from the countless egg dishes, to the usual breakfasts favorites, like, pancakes, French toast,  biscuits &gravy, omelettes, skillets...you name it, Brothers serves it.  Their  chorizo & green chili omelette with home style potatoes is to die for. 

Best Breakfast Ever!

 I would absolutely recommend Brothers Family Restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. We were shocked When our waitress aproached us she said \"coffee and iced tea, same as last time\". It has been two months since our last visit. That is amazing. Leti was our waitress, drinks were always full, food was great. We will be back. Thanks again for such great service."}
{"text":"Great food! When my boyfriend and I travel we like to use Yelp to find favorite local places and It steered us to Brothers for breakfast. We ordered from the specials board : Chorizo and Green Chile omelet, which we split plus a short stack. The home fries benefited from the addition of the fresh salsa that was on the side; the omelet was very tasty as is. Pancakes were perfect. Service was friendly and quick. I recommend this place for all our spring training brethren!"}
{"text":"The food was good but when an woman came into the restaurant with a small dog it spoiled the whole place.  
Dogs shouldn't be allow in restaurants!  it's not healthy!!!"}
{"text":"Truly a greasy spoon. I'm pretty sure smoking is outlawed in restaurants but the place does have the aroma of a smoker trying to quit.  Across the street from Peoria Cafe, Brother's boasts a cheap breakfast (I spent 16 dollars for myself and 3 kids, with a tip and drinks for all) and a friendly staff.  The food is average greasy spoon fare - but if you want a sit down breakfast at a price cheaper than McDonald's, I recommend Brother's."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything special about this place. Actually, my husband made a joke that the place reminded him of a restaurant that would be on that bad kitchen show with Gordon Ramsey haha. He wasn't wrong, the food didn't look like anything on the menu. Taste was average. Service was average. The interior reminded us of a doctors office or a bathroom/kitchen lol. Two breakfast meals and two cups of coffee came out to $20. Average."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a group Sunday brunch at Brothers. There were 14 people in our group and we were seated in a separate group dining room.

Our waitress was great, she knew how to serve a group of diners with 7 separate checks. Our food arrived within five minutes of the first dish to arrive and the last dish to arrive. Drink refills appeared without asking.

I ordered open face turkey with mashed potatoes and drink, hubby ordered breakfast and coffee. His chorizo was a little dry and my dish could have been warmer. 

Our tab, with a piece of pie to take home, with tip was $25."}
{"text":"Since moving from NY this is one of our favorite breakfast spots. Service is always friendly, fast and our coffee is promptly refilled  (which always makes me happy) Today we ordered Chicken Fried Steak + Eggs also comes with toast AND homefries we also ordered the two biscuits with gravy  yaaaah we shared and left FULL. I highly recommend this place as we have been here a handful of times now and always leave happy and well taken care of!"}
{"text":"Our server Maureen was excellent. I was skeptic about eating chorizo here and she brought me a sample that she had made for me (awesome). My friends enjoyed their biscuits and gravy was great and I enjoyed my Denver omelette."}
{"text":"Got here and got seated right away, restaurant was busy, but our waitress Marda took our drink order right away. She wasn't as quick to return after we ordered our food. We waited about 25 minutes for our breakfast, which basically was returned to the kitchen, 2 of the 3 orders were made incorrectly. Marda was very unfriendly, and didn't care to much that she had taken the orders incorrectly. The owner came to our table with many many excuses as to why we had a delay getting our breakfast today. Very disappointed and didn't really do anything to rectify the situation. We will not be going there again. And who doesn't have Avocado in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"A friend had suggested Brothers for dinner.  The outside could use a facelift, but once inside this place is bright, large and sparkling clean.  The servers are young, delightful, caring but not intrusive.  The food is excellent and the portions are huge.  I had the fried catfish that came with 3 sides.   Beyond delicious.   With so many mediocre restaurants in the area this came as a pleasant surprise.   I can hardly wait to go back, which will be real soon."}
{"text":"One extra star because our waitress was AWESOME. Some items also deserve extra star. My grandparents used to go to this place. Now, I live in their wonderful house so I gotta find good places around here. Honest review. Husband disappointed with Gyro. Fried zucchini and ranch. Crackalicious. Chicken rice lemon soup. Good filler but needs more zesty lemon like traditional avgolemono. Chicken fried steak. Edible, but I'm from Texas.  Toast. Good and buttered properly. Accompanying eggs.  Cooked perfectly to order. Accompanying home fries.  Terrible. Dry, cold, and devoid of any seasoning. Get with it on home fries. People depend on good ones. Again, waitress was wonderful and working her butt off!"}
{"text":"We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and Waited 15 minutes for someone to come talk to us. Had to get up and go find someone to come and take our order. Eggs were wet, bacon was salty and biscuit was hard. When we told the server the food was bad she walked to the back and quickly returned saying she couldn't find a manager. We saw 2 managers walking around aimlessly and no one came to talk to us about the problem. Men's bathroom door doesn't close properly. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch looking to get some nice home style cooking. Upon entering one of the employees kids politely opened the door, which already put a good feel to this place. The restaurant itself seemed modern but at the same time old fashioned. After entering we were able to choose our own seats, which was definitely a plus for me. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and also gave us good recommendations. I got the country fried skillet and my fiancé had the pancakes, bacon eggs and an apple crepe. Overall the service was on point and the food was a decent serving size and tasted great! This place is certainly a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"Large menu with lots of good diner food. Service is usually pretty good. This is usually my breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The best gyro's and very reasonably priced breakfast.  We moved away but when we stop by in Phoenix, we like to grab a quick bite here at Brother's!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 8:30pm. They offer 24 hour breakfast with lots of choices. Very nice menu. Good service."}
{"text":"My family of 3 go at least once a week. Excellent price and always a service with a smile. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place for Sunday breakfast with the family! No matter how busy they are you're always welcomed with a smile. The place is clean, prices are great and there is something on the menu for everyone! One of my biggest annoyances with a restaurant is having to wait for a refill of my drink and that has never been a problem here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited this had opened and so incredibly disappointed at the $&@!!??$&@!!! Service! The bartender \"Elvira\" was exactly that rude! Bartenders are clearly amateurs! Lol! 3 patrons had not been served waving their hands we need drinks and not one bartender acknowledged these paying customers! We left when we got a dirty look from the bartender \"Elvira\" after she dropped a beer. All the bartenders seemed like it was there first rodeo and did not even know what they had on tap! Sunday is football why would  you not staff a new place appropriately. Not coming back. Good job!"}
{"text":"Brothers Restaurant is the best Cafe in Peoria, hands down!! I've been going there EVERY Sunday for breakfast since 1995. The chicken and rice soup is the BESSST!! The service is even better."}
{"text":"Service is super quick here.
Food is decent for the price, if you want a quick breakfast this is a good option."}
{"text":"Not to bad for a new breakfast place.  We were looking for something new right before heading out of town.  My girlfriend ordered a short stack of pancakes and I munched down on their breakfast burrito.  It was pretty good, but too hot so i had to let cool down some.  After tasting her pancakes, I decided next time.. I too will be enjoying a stack of those tasty cakes."}
{"text":"A very quaint little family-run restaurant in the heart of downtown Peoria. They have great dinner specials and the breakfast is very good and inexpensive. I am definitely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Treated us like family!! Best customer service in a long time from the hostess to the waitress!! I had literally the best country fried steak I've ever had & my wife had the French dip where they even make it with their own homemade flaky bread.. Definitely highly recommended & we will be back with more friends & family to show this place off!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I really wanted to love Brothers Family Restaurant. 
I ordered a take out of biscuits and gravy and a side of potatoes.
Upon walking in, the hostess seemed confused on how to handle the situation when I said I had a take out order. She looked over to find her co-worker to wave her over. She told me, \"she can help you\" and I wasn't directed to wait in a particular place. There were people behind me and by that time the other woman disappeared...? So I just sat at the breakfast bar. I was impressed by two servers who asked if I needed help. One offered a drink. 
That's what I call actually ~hosting~.
After waiting about 7 minutes (I called about 15 minutes prior) a woman came out and handed me my ticket and food. 
The previous woman seemed to be blank again when I went to pay. 
I totaled at $8 and some change. 
As she had my money...which I didn't see go into the register...? She like, sat it on the side of the register and started talking to her coworker but a guy that needed seated or something. 

Totally forgot I was there...again, people behind me. What up ANXIETY!?! Holllaaaaa.
Anyways, I asked if I gave her $9 dollars and she counted it...barely? 
She said yes and then I said okay thanks and she seemed slightly become aware that I was a human being in front of her and asked me to have a good day. I left. I didn't wait for my change because it was probably going to be extremely confusing.

I wish the food made up for my lackluster service. 
Bland potatoes...literally just some shreds of Idaho potato. No seasonings...nothing. Close to $3. 

The biscuits and gravy...
*drum roll please*...
Or shall I just review the biscuits...? Where is the gravy? Also, what is the gravy? Bland af and nothing special whatsoever.

The portions are a good size, no doubt.

But I'll take quality over quantity, any day.

I really like to support mom and pop shops...but holy cow, what a disappointment."}
{"text":"So the one thing I always do when I visit Phoenix is eat here! They have rally good food and one thing in particular I liked was the sausage. One person in our party got the blueberry pancakes and their not cooked into them like they are normally elsewhere but rather dolloped on top with too much blueberry syrup sauce...stuff lol. They would have got a full five stars if it wasn't for that...thing they called blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is very bland and dated. The service was very meh. Definitely an old people hole in the wall. Nothing special. All of the food is fried and not very tasty. Definitely skip"}
{"text":"Brothers restaurant has been a long time favorite. They've been around Downtown Peoria for years and have decent food at a good price. The waitresses have always been nice and friendly. So yes give them a try."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood place. Good food, friendly staff. Letty is the best... It's in \"old town\" Peoria, so there's a fair amount of seniors, but it's still a great place for breakfast or a quick, casual dinner."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Good cup of coffee.  Food came out quick and was good and hot. Prices were extremely fair and our waitress was very nice and diligent."}
{"text":"This was hard to find when you go down 85th ave, it's easier to find if you go down Peoria. There is construction outside but it's nice inside, the bathrooms are nice. Service was prompt and my sisters strawberry milkshake came out quick. This strawberry milkshake was delicious, yummy cream tasting and they give you extra on the side so its basically two milkshakes. I drank the extra one. I ordered french toast and scrambled egg with corned beef hash. I've been craving good scrambled eggs and this was really good and fluffy. The corned beef hash was not very salty, I actually prefer it a lil greasy and salty but it was edible unlike the cottage cheese from my moms stuffed tomato plate. My sister liked her filling strawberry french toast. My sister said the home fries only tasted good with ketchup. however we both didn't like that the ketchup was coldout of the fridge, i prefer room temperature ketchup. My mom felt her stuffed tomato with Tuna salad was just right. She liked the plate presentation and said the tuna didn't have too much mayonnaise , it was just right. Overall we liked this place and its open on Christmas Day ."}
{"text":"Great food, Great prices. Your typical mom and pop stop, friendly and filling."}
{"text":"First time visit. Looked for a place for brunch while visiting. Food was good, service was good, food delivery was timely. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food and quick and efficient service!  The staff was very friendly.  Cleaned up tables around us rather quickly!  Decent size parking lot!  Will definitely have a return visit!!"}
{"text":"God the guy who owns this place is so cheap.
That's why the food is never the same. If bacon is cheaper at depot, he gets it at depot. If Shamrock has a deal he gets it there. 
Week to Week the exact same dish doesn't taste the same. 
The other problem he has is the age of his customers.
90% of them have one foot in the grave. In 3 years when they are all dead tell me what he is going to do?"}
{"text":"Very welcoming establishment. Lots of choices on the menu. Service was good. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with good food and a hometown feel. I have never had a bad meal at this place. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot the food is tasty, great prices, clean and very friendly service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for 20 years. Food and service going downhill. Cold food, wrong order and unpleasant waitress. Won't be back again. What a shame. Great place gone to hell"}
{"text":"I must start off by saying we eat here quite often. They remodeled a few years ago and it is beautiful inside. We come here often for breakfast and the breakfast is always great! My husband and I love broasted chicken, tonite as well as the last few times we ordered it here, it was terrible. First of all I can't believe you can even buy chicken pieces that small! The chicken has gotten so small that when they broasted it, it was dry and burned. Very over cooked! Boasted chicken should be very moist, tender and delicious. When you adder broasted potatoes they give you about 1/4 of a potato. Two potato wedges. They have raise the price to almost $10 and have really cut back on the food quality. I think the owners need to visit a competitor so they can taste first hand how amazing broasted chicken can be! Next time we want broasted chicken we will head to the Longhorn Saloon in Wadell!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have breakfast with my wife. We haven't had great service prior, but its half a mile from home. We decided to give them one last try. Well my wife ordered an omelette. After a few bites what does she find? A blade mixed in her food. I don't know how she saw it cause it took me a couple of seconds to see it after she showed me. The waitress says oh its the blade from the tomato cutter. Like no big deal right! They had the nerve to try and charge us for everything but my wife omelette. They lucky my wife didn't bite into that blade!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast this morning. Food was delicious and had a great price! Not very healthy but really good. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Never saw the bottom of my coffee. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, greeted w/a smile. Variety of food for breakfast and lunch.  You can tell they have been around a long time and the best thing is they know how to cook and treat their customers to keep having you come back. My hubby and I will diffidently be going back."}
{"text":"Looking to try something different but still on the west side we picked Brothers. The restaurant itself is quite nice and a lot bigger than I expected. We were fairly early (around 8:30am) and there wasn't any wait, but as time progressed it was starting to get busy. Everyone was so super friendly!!! I had seen lots of pic's of chicken fried steak so that's what I ordered and it did not disappoint. Our food came out super quickly! It was very good. My husband drinks a lot in the morning and he never had to ask for a refill. We were really impressed. I really wish we lived closer because we would totally be regulars here."}
{"text":"I stopped by for breakfast and got there at about 8:30am. It wasn't too busy but there were a lot of full tables. I was told to sit wherever I liked. Within about a minute of sitting down, a waitress came by to drop off water or coffee. The waitress stopped by a couple times for refills.

I ordered a combo with 2 eggs, bacon, and biscuits and gravy. The food came out really fast! It seemed like within just a couple of minutes from when I ordered. The food tasted good."}
{"text":"I went here with the husband and his parents this morning to celebrate his dad's birthday. It was overall a pleasant place. The outside looks fairly modern and the inside looks like they put some effort into the decor. The service here was great, the waitress was friendly, helpful, and kept our drinks full the whole time. The food here was very inexpensive, with not many dishes over 6$. As expected, the food isn't anything special. I had the eggs benedict special and it was fine... not something I would run back for, but fine. The hollandaise didn't taste like it was freshly made (maybe the stuff from the jar... eek... maybe just a somewhat poorly made hollandaise... either way, not great). The benedict also had some spinach on it that they had absolutely cooked to death, but the eggs were cooked correctly. The potatoes on the side were very plain. The biscuits and gravy the husband had were also just ok. The coffee was good. Overall, for the price this place is fine, and if it were in my neighborhood, I would come here once in awhile, but it's nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"My family and I come here almost every week after church. 
They have such a great staff & the food is excellent. It's homemade with love and the staff is caring. Amanda and Jose take care of us in their back room each week & we always get attentive service from them.
That's not to say that the rest of the staff should be left out... We've probably been served by each waitress in the joint & they're all great!
Thanks for being such a warm and welcoming restaurant with great food!
We'll see you again this Sunday!
I'll have a tea & Cobb salad with extra ranch!"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast and I found the service good and staff friendly, especially Gwen who was our server. She was attentive without being overly so. The menu had a great variety to choose from and the specials are great. The lunch and dinner menu looks impressive so will be back to try those as well - been looking for a place to get a gyros. The place is bigger than it looks so was seated right away. Nice booths or table. Is a local family diner and looked clean and orderly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here,  friendly staff and customers.
Had the Reuben on rye, very good."}
{"text":"Great little homestyle diner with fair prices. If you are in the neighborhood and want a good breakfast that wont break the bank give the place a try."}
{"text":"The Chicken fried steak breakfast with 2 black coffees. That alone is worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been going to Brothers for almost 5 years now.   Usually on Sunday holidays. Or when we are going to do something and do not want to prepare food at home. Probably about 8 to 10 times a year.   Breakfast is the only meal I have eaten. Breakfast is not hard to prepare. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles are not hard to fix. Why is this the only place I eat breakfast when I am in Peoria? \"Service\" When you get there you are greeted with a smile. Everyone acts like they are genuinely glad you are there. They are ready to do what it takes to keep their customers happy. Your coffee cup is kept full. If your waiter or waitress is not there to fill your cup someone else passing by with coffee is. You can get bacon, eggs, two pieces of toast, and hash browns for $2.99. Why would anyone in the area go anywhere else? Everything always comes out tasting good,"}
{"text":"This is our usual go to for a weekend family breakfast. The service here is good, and they are always so friendly. We have only been for breakfast so I can't speak to the quality of their lunch or dinner, but they do breakfast well. 

This place is similar to the old, family run, greasy spoon restaurants of yesteryear. Your coffee cup will never be empty in this place and you will never leave hungry. 

The breakfast is pretty standard stuff, but they have a lot of options,and are very reasonably priced. They always offer lots of specials, and I would highly suggest the green chili pork. I didn't expect it to be so good, but I really love it. My wife usually gets some sort of scramble and we are always pleased."}
{"text":"My parents were in town for a family function and we were looking for a place to grab some breakfast. We found Brother's and were very pleased we did! They serve great breakfasts (I recommend the bacon and sausage skillet) The server was very nice and she kept my coffee filled! We will be back whenever we find ourselves hungry and in Peoria!"}
