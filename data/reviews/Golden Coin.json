  Two employees were seemingly I an argument that left people uncomfortable."}
{"text":"love their sweet and sour pork and fried wings and chicken! that's what you go their for.  every thing else is ok. the wings come cooked diffrently each day. and you have to have the chilli sauce with the chicken and its just as good with everything else. no it ain't no pf chang, for less then 7.00 bucks for a meal its good. 
        and with the scenery, what could you expect from a city that doesn't care about its outer look!"}
{"text":"Very small selection of food.  a little over $7 total with tax and drink.

One long tray of fried chicken.... only one thing missing. KETCHUP. Why bother eating fried chicken if you can't have it with Ketchup?
No refill in drinks except ice tea. 

I gave two stars because the fried chicken actually tasted good.  If you like eating loads of fried chicken. go to this buffet. Just bring your own ketchup. lol

 I will never go to this buffet again, except if i have a massive craving for fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this buffet for well over 22 years. And guess what they are always consistent as a matter of fact not a whole hell  of a lot has changed in all those years.....and that's a good thing. The buffet food is not gourmet, its not the type of place that is going to attract food snobs, or Scotsdale/Paradise Valley food critics. Not that they wouldn't perhaps come on their own time to have some of the yummy buffet offerings........but you just aren't going to see that lot at Golden Coin on official business.( what ever official business is je je je) the food is good and not at all expensive. From my memory bank...the buffet consists of the same thing as daily offerings fried chicken, soft lo mein.  Noodles
 with veggies (cabbage, onion, bean sprouts) some kind of fried rice I think its pork. Mixed vegetables. Which consisted of..... Broccoli(large florets and not over cooked yum) cabbage, carrots and mushrooms. The vegetables are delicious never over cooked always fresh and in abundance. Sweet and sour pork,  and on Fridays they had fried fish. I'm sure the price has gone up but the last time I ate there the buffet was $5.50 or $5.75.
At times I ate the chicken and its deep fried. However its good yes a bit greasy but never too greasy I would always douse it it in hot sauce. In the early years I would request steamed rice; which is not offered on the buffet. But the one middle aged gentleman would bring me out a nice bowl of steamed rice. 
Golden Coin is the last of the diansours. Because their used too be many similar Chinese buffets in the Valley of the Sun. But not any more. I'm happy that Golden Coin is still around. 
If you don't have much money, or if your just craving some ok to descent fried chicken and so very good fresh stir fried vegetables all you can eat.  Drop by Golden Coin. You'll notice many laborers, office workers. A little bit of every profession  in for a quick lunch or dinner  Its popular with the locals  And just about anybody that knows about it and has eaten here.
Golden Coin I hope you survive for a long time to come
You've become rarity, when at one time their were many similar to you."}
{"text":"I know it gets a lot of bad reviews, but since I've been going to this place since I was a kid, and sweet and sour pork is my favorite \"Chinese\" dish, I'm giving it 5 stars. I remember as a kid, all of the Chinese food buffets had a thin sweet and sour sauce on crispy bits of breaded fried pork, but every other buffet I go to now has a very thick, overly sweet sauce. It's not a desert, it shouldn't be so sweet, and Golden Coin has been making this dish the same for so long, it's an absolutely perfect blend of sweet and sour. No they don't have a big selection, but it's better to make a few great items than to make 1000 mediocre items."}
{"text":"Walked in the other day. Looked at the dashboard size buffet of 8 maybe 10 items. One of those being fried chicken, which is probably better done across the street. Walked back out and will never return. The place is a rat hole! The building should be condemned."}
{"text":"This place! They love talking shit. If you walk in this place you are basically giving free reign to the 2 ladies that are always here to make fun of you in Chinese. I've ate at many Chinese restaurants and most (not all) but most talk shit. But no restaurant I've ever ate at spoke so much shit about their customers as this one. And it is quite offensive. I don't get offended easily but the shit they say I can't even believe they would think! I'd say more than 75% of the words they speak are insults hurled at their customers to each other. That is a lot! That's all they talk about here. They literally have no life. And they know how to bicker without staring at you or blatantly laughing. Everytime I come here I pretend I don't know their language and listen as they talk mad shit about me, how much I eat, when will I leave... they will make fun of anyone especially fat people and black people. Even their own kind (me). I've sat through meals here quietly listening to them judge how I ate, how much I ate, debating why I was here alone, calling me \"Americanized\" but in Chinese there is a very offensive way of saying it and that was the word they used instead of the literal meaning. 

What sparked my post today as opposed to any other day is because I came this week and the whole time I sat eating alone. I watched as they made fun of this fat Latino lady who barely spoke English and was also eating alone. We were the only two people in the restaurant. I was there for 30 mins maybe longer, taking my time. They were sweeping and cleaning making fun of how she ate. She was eating with her hands and no fork but she was eating fried chicken so makes sense. Joking about how many plates she has cleared out of the way. Apparently she had been in there for 2 hours eating away. Maybe they were joking I don't know. But the sad things they said about her to each other infuriated me. Making fun of her thighs. How they feared she would crack their benches. Asking how she could squeeze herself in between the bench and table after each plate bloated her more. Asking each other how much money the other lost due to servicing her. Questioning if they should shut down the place right now. Joking about whether they could actually kick her out of the door if they wanted to. It was rude. I hear little things on other days they say about people but it's usually just a few comments per person. We were the only two people in there and hearing them spout shit nonstop about her (and some comments about me, but not nearly as much) was not appetizing to be around. I felt so bad for that lady who had no idea.

Food is decent but when I come I must be strong. Because some of the things they say hit me pretty strongly and I just want to stand up and yell at them. But I come often  because it's fast and convenient so I don't want to cause a scene and make it awkward for myself.

Tip: if you wanna know when these two Asian bitches are talking shit about someone while dining, a few of the less toned down insults are followed or started by an \"aiyyyyy\" (sounds like the letter I as in hi) or any long vowel they draw out. Sometimes \"Eeeeeeeeeyh\", \"ahhhhhhhh\", you get the point."}
{"text":"For some reason my parents loved the Golden Coin chain when I was a child, and this seems to be the only one left standing. Maybe it was better back then, I don't really know. First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die."}
{"text":"Spotted the all-you-can-eat sign on my way home. Naturally, I stopped by later to see if the food was worth it.

The selection is small but delicious. It feels more like a family kitchen rather than a big buffet. There are only about six to eight options, including sweet and sour pork, fried rice, and egg rolls. (I enjoyed these dishes the most!)

Drawbacks include the following: costly drink refills, cash only and an inconveniently placed bathroom."}
{"text":"Love this place been eating here since I can remember. I will definitely be going here for the rest of my life"}
{"text":"Take out or dine in for the bargain price of $6.15.  Obviously concessions have been made in the quality department and Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is nothing more than a cheap fill-up.  
In fact, this Chinese buffet has been filling a niche of mass quantities of Cantonese style food offered on a warm buffet for decades.  Pull the couch apart, look for some loose change in the cushions, ask to borrow a dollar on your way in and you are all set to put the feed bag on - this is a cash only establishment!

It was more out of nostalgia that I stopped in to see if anything has changed in the last 25 years . . . it hasn't and that is not necessarily a bad thing, per se.  The same sweet and sour pork is being prepared, the same way (which is to say floating in gallons of sauce, only adding more flour coated pork bits when the vat is low) along with rice, noodles, vegetables, Egg Foo Young, egg rolls cut in half (as if you will take less that way) and fried chicken thighs along with a hard-to-find drumstick thrown in.  In fact there is a constant filling of the dozen or so choices on the steam table as if the staff were chumming its patrons for their own amusement - it is like a controlled ration.  Really, it is amazing to see the flood of people grab a plate and palpitate while more food is being dumped into the pan having their second or third or eighth helping.  

Order water, pay tax and leave a tip all for 8 dollars and leave feeling full and regretting eating so much mediocre food while contemplating a possible Montezuma's revenge for dining here.     Maybe takeout is a better option as it keeps you from over-imbibing; or perhaps, it is the thrill of risky dining excursions that keep people coming back . . . will I get sick this time or not?   Will the food be bad enough for me to vow to never come back or will the memory of my excessive consumption be overcome by the lure of cheap all you can eat?  
    . . . yes it will.

{"text":"Very great price, but it is all cash. The soda doesn't have free refills, but the iced tea does!! They have a weekly rotation so there's a different special in addition to the always-popular sweet and sour pork every night. Definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Too be 100% honest it isn't all that bad. The food was decent. They do have a small selection but it is only $5 for all you can eat.

I'm giving them 5 stars because all the reviews on here is expecting 5 star dining for $5.. a bit unfair for an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"I love the food and it well priced.  Not a big selection of food but the food they do have is very good specially the egg rolls and the sweet and sour pork. If you can look past the building looking undesirable you would not be sorry you stopped to eat here. We always try to stop here when we are in this side of town."}
{"text":"I was suckered in by the price ($6.15 after taxes), but you really do get what you pay for here. More veggie selections than meat, which can be good for some folks. However, it's cash only and they don't have free refills for drinks?? Plus, most of the food is rather bland. If you need food without any spice (which could explain all the bottles of Tapatio at each table) or flavour, this is the place. Cannot recommend, unless you are just short of turning cannibal."}
{"text":"I've been going since I was a little kid. It's always been a go-to. You can dine in at the buffet which is always a good experience for me or you can get a to go box which is what I usually do. I get everything for like 6 bucks. The box is usually piled over and takes me like 3 sittings to finish. The box weighs like 3 or 4 pounds it's crazy. The food is amazing for how cheap it is. It always comes with a free paper bag of Chinese chips.  My favorite is the broccoli. They're also very understanding. 
They forgot to give my dad free chips so when I went back like 2 weeks later I told them and they gave me 3 free bags. I hella recommend."}
{"text":"Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star! 

I don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  \"No Probably\" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   

                                  Eight Items on the Buffet 

Fried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork


As I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: \"How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right\"?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. 

So there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!"}
{"text":"The $5.98 Chinese buffet sign pulled me in. I have to admit I was pretty nervous pulling into the parking lot. The restaurant looked a little dated. But as so in as we got out of the car I could smell the food and it smelled great. There selection is limited but it definitely was worth the $6 we paid. The food was fresh properly seasoned and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Arizona Hiking Shack next door and needed to feed my inner animal. $6 buffet sounds like a great deal to me!

The staff was friendly and the fried chicken is awesome! Not a huge buffet of items but if you like friend chicken and died rice this place is great!"}
{"text":"Went into this quaint little place one afternoon and I'm dying to go back. Is it the best chinese food I've ever had? Absolutely not. It does rank high though in terms of value. For $6.55 or so, I can eat unlimited sweet and sour pork, fried rice, chow mein, steamed vegetables, egg rolls, and two more choices that are rotated all throughout the week. I tried asking the manager what other dishes do they serve but she was difficult to understand and didn't quite know what I was asking. 

The dining room is small, and the seats are anchored to the floor which is very uncomfortable if you're large like me. There's a hole in the glass window towards the back which is covered with a strip of cardboard and taped to the glass haha. If you can set aside your dignity and dare yourself to go to this side of town, you may be in for a pleasant treat. Remember, CASH ONLY and you do pay per refill ($1.50) for sodas! From what I could tell, ordering to go looked legit as the ladies behind the counter really cram as much food as possible into one styrofoam container."}
{"text":"If you are craving for Chinese food and on a tight budget then this is the place for you!! For the price you pay its a well worth it. Don't let the snobs scare you away, all you have to do is look inside and there are plenty of people eating especially on Friday night!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a great selection of food. Dingy. Brought me horrible, watered down tea instead of the diet I asked for. Very cheap. Had to ask for white rice.  Panda it aint and they don't try to be. Not going back."}
{"text":"Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.

Generally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY, with tax included $6.15 paid for my admission to this buffet-style meal.  Kid's under the age of four eat for $2.  It was surprisingly busy.

The \"buffet\", in its entirety:
Won-Ton Crisps
Fried Rice
Chow Mein
Mixed Vegetables
French Fries
Egg Roll Halves
Fried Chicken
Hot Wings
Sweet & Sour Pork

Here in lay my greatest criticism; Yes, technically, there is more than one Chinese item among the food set out in large trays for an individual to return to as many times as they like.  In no other way does the Gold Coin overlap with common consumer expectation of a \"Chinese Buffet.\"  So, why was it so busy?  Because, for a tick north of five bucks a person could gluttonously stuff themselves with the above items; it is better thought of as an economical \"family-style\" meal.  If it was advertised as such, I bet Mike's would get better reviews as people wouldn't feel mislead when they walked in, and the balance of Chinese, to American, to Italian, to Mexican to whatever cultural dishes would be freed up as well.  It has its redeeming qualities, which is why it didn't get the single start rating; it's clean, inexpensive, and seemed like a friendly casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's one of the cheapest all you can eat Chinese buffets in Phoenix and that is reflected in the food. I went here 3-4 times before I realized I'd rather pay a little more and get better quality. Anyone remember David Kwan's on Dunlap ? That was my favorite no thrills mom and pop Chinese buffet. 

Now the fried chicken at Golden Coin is legitimately good ! So good it saved them from a 0 star rating. It's the best item on the buffet. If you have to eat here, you could make a meal of that chicken with some rice and veggies.

But the fried rice is unremarkable. The low mein noodle have an off flavor, and too salty, it might be MSG, I don't know. One time, the noodles were really undercooked. The sweet and sour pork has a good sauce - thin not thick. But the pork they use is tough and low quality. You need to chew it for a long time. When the steamed vegetables are fresh, they're not bad. Hard to mess that up. 

When going for a cheap Chinese buffet meal, I'd rather spend an extra dollar or two. It goes a long way. Golden Nugget on 51st Ave/Indian School or May Garden on 59th are both so much better than Golden Coin. The extra $2 they charge buys a 200% increase in quality."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for the last 7 years or more. It is what you expect for cheap Chinese food. It is even referred to by my wife a \"The Cheap Chinese Place\". The Sweet and Sour Pork is a staple. The egg rolls are awesome and the Ice Tea is cold.. most of the time. The \"To Go\" Order is an amazing amount of food for the price. I highly recommend this place for a try. Don't go in expecting the best but it's better than most."}
{"text":"This place sucks the food is awful and the the people are mean and you pay $1.35 for your first drink the have to pay the same price for a refill it suck there are better places to spend your money at"}
{"text":"this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return"}
{"text":"I found myself in Phoenix, and the Golden Coin called out to me.

Was it the minimal selection of only 8 or 9 options, at least two of them not at all Chinese, that brought me back? Certainly, I ate my fill of crisp wonton strips, fried rice, egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables, and the inevitable sweet and sour pork. I avoided completely the fried chicken and the french fries, and didn't regret my choice. I tried the chow mein noodles but didn't go back for more. I lamented the lack of lemon chicken, a favorite of mine from when I came here over 20 years ago.

Was it the price? $7 and change for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection isn't much to look at and the food itself doesn't stand out either. Service is kept to a minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda of your choice is brought to a table chosen for you while you load up your plate. Empty plates are taken away regularly, and food is replenished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it sounds like a lot of cooking is happening.

Was it the ambience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the sounds of the cooking behind the scenes nearly drowned out by the sound of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable DVD player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did 20 years ago, shaped vaguely like alien faces from the classic 1950's version of 'War of the Worlds'?

The truth is that it was all of these things. Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love those wonton crisps!), the service is minimal, and the price is right. But Golden Coin remains today mostly like what it was 20+ years ago, right down to the worn tables and the alien-face plates. Walking in and smelling the food is a strong dose of nostalgia, and remains a consistent experience in a world filled with change."}
{"text":"Worst. Buffet. Ever.

'Nuff said. No...scratch that, I must vent. Or Yelp.

Wow, what a disaster. My workmate and I were craving a buffet today, and on the way into work I had passed the Golden Coin and thought it looked like any standard cheap buffet from the outside. But I was fooled, it's not just ANY cheap buffet, it's THE cheap buffet. 

Well, as Roger Daltrey says, \"I won't get fooled again!\"

The sign outside says $4.86 buffet, lunch or dinner. For less than a Lincoln, it's worth a try, right? (Wrong!) First of all, cash only, people, no plastic. And here's the ENTIRE buffet list:

Rice (of the brown fried variety, bland)
Lo Mein (I'm not sure what that taste is, but it ain't Lo Mein)
Egg Rolls (small, cut in half, and awful. And there's that \"taste\" again...)
Fried Chicken (the only food of redeeming quality)
Wings (again, bland, though decent in size)
Sweet and Sour Pork (I'll get to this in a second)

Yep, that's it. The whole buffet. And no refills on the sodas, either. Some greasy chinese crispy noodles. No soup. (Hey, no soup means not having to provide spoons!)

The fried chicken wasn't bad, but other than that, I wouldn't serve this food to prisoners. Except the ones on death row, and that's to save money on electricity.

I'm not quite sure what the deal was with the Sweet and Sour Pork. The sauce was the consistency of water, the meat was......wait, I don't want to know. 

If I could give it 1/1000th of a star, I'd do it. Steer clear, and your digestive system will thank you."}
{"text":"Very affordable. Only $6.15 for an adult. Drinks are extra. Inside the restaurant was very clean despite the tables being well worn. They carry a small variety of food including your standard Chinese buffet items: fried rice, lo mien, egg rolls, sweet and sour. Overall about 8-10 items. There was a fairly large lunch crowd when I went. Overall food was pretty decent for the price."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in about 10 years . . . and it was exactly like I remembered it . . . even to the pale green walls . . . how sad.

This place has a very limited buffet menu and I tried about 7 of the 10 items . . . so here we go . . .
Fried Won Ton . . . Nothing Special
Vegetable Chow Main . . . Tasted more like Spaghetti than Chow Mein Noodles
Vegetable Fried Rice . . . Bland White Rice with Vegetables
Orange Chicken . . . This was actually pretty good . . . SURPRISE
Vegatable Egg Roll . . . Luke warm and more wrapper than filling
Deep Fried Zuccini . . . Cold
Sweet and Sour Pork . . . Runny Sauce and Fried Pork lacked and flavor

So in a nut shell . . . Food on the lower end of the scale . . . Price was CHEAP . . . and that is why it got 2 stars.  It might be another 10 years before I come back again."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Golden Coin for quite some time after seeing how cheap the food was. We visited this buffet on Friday evening after a fun night at the casino. We walked in and it they had customers coming in and out frequently. Some  ordered takeout while others opted for the buffet. We waited at the front counter and for 2 adults we paid $13. We ordered waters for our beverages which was free. The front register is right next to the buffet. The buffet seemed to have about seven or eight items. There was fried rice, chow mein, mixed veggies, egg rolls, won ton crisps, fried chicken, and sweet and sour pork. For how cheap we paid for dinner I think the food was pretty good. Not the best in the world but not sure what people expect when the price is so low. My favorites were the fried chicken, and the steamed veggies. My boyfriend really liked the chow mein and the fried chicken. 

The dining room wasn't very large but we were seated quickly. The workers were very polite and seemed very focused in their work. Our plates were cleared quickly, and the dining room was kept very clean. I looked around for a bathroom but didn't see one. I will most likely return to this location in the future for some cheap but filling foods."}
{"text":"Love this place most flavorful. Food selection ever. Love there crispy Chinese chicken and sweet and sour pork the most!"}
{"text":"Mike Kwan's Golden Coin Chinese Buffet. I lived near here when I was in my early 20's. This was my go-to spot for mass quantities of cheap food after running a 10k... Well, it's been more than a few years and the only 10k's I'm logging now are steps on my Fitbit. I've changed, but the Golden Coin has remained the same.

All you can eat for just $6.15, including tax. Drinks are extra, but most folks on this day were just drinking water. The food is fine, all things considered, even including fried chicken in addition to the egg rolls, fried rice, sweet & sour, chow mien... you'd expect. The mixed veggies, heavy on broccoli, are actually quite good.

To be so cheap, some compromises are no doubt made in the kitchen. There was also duct tape holding the front door handle together this day. Tables are well worn... But the restaurant seems busy and the patrons happy and satisfied. As long as you have appropriate expectations, the Golden Coin remains a pretty good choice for those with a craving for basic Chinese in quantity.

Note that this is a CASH ONLY business. Just $2 for kids age four and under, but the cost jumps up to the full adult charge at age five."}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly better than i thought it would be, considering i rarely ever eat cheap food much less cheap all you can eat Chinese food. But do far the food is edible, i don't think I'm gonna get food poisoning, and it was after all cheap $7.40 for dinner with all your can eat and soda. 
I'm dropping stars because it seems impossible to get a refill on soda. So far it's been fifteen minutes and I thirsty as heck.  Is normally leave a tip, but I'm not happy with their service here"}
