{"text":"amazing amazing amazing. the place isnt THAT pricey. it average price now especially considering minmum wage went up. fresh and delicious. forget about the shawarma. get the rice plates. cant remember which type of rice i had but it was amazing and it comes with so much variety. by far the best middle eastern food ive had. like i dont know why this place isnt more popular, should be a franchise or something."}
{"text":"This is a small mom and pop type of store that serves office workers nearby. They serve authentic shawarma plates, sandwiches and other types of Middle Eastern foods, with very generous portions and reasonable prices. 

What has caused me to write though is this new dish that was introduced 2 weeks ago. The experimental cook, who trained in Germany, exercised his creativity by introducing a tender, mouth-watering melt-in-your-mouth brisket with an unbelievable mushroom sauce. I wasn't going to budge but then he gave me a small sample and I immediately changed my order from beef shawarma to the brisket. 

Not only did I change it, but every person behind in line also changed their order when he also gave them a sample piece. I came back to work and the brisket, on a bed of greens, looked and smelled so good that 4 or my colleagues went and got it too. They too loved it!

I went the following week for the brisket and he admitted that he ran out as it's now the most popular item in the restaurant. Frankly, it's incredible that a meal that could be served at high-end fancy steak houses could be found in a local mom and pop non-descript place."}
{"text":"This place USED TO be great! They would give you huge portions, were never stingy about the portions. Even gave me some free potatoes once for making me wait. 

All of a sudden they changed. They offer 2 different types of unrelated cuisines and quality went downhill. Disappointing as it used to be my go to cheap eat in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first meal when I landed in Toronto! I happened to be walking by and took a chance since I saw them advertise daily specials. I came on a Friday and they were offering 2 plates for $15.99. See my pics and you'll see that this is a great value cuz there's TONS of food in 1 plate. You will be stuffed if you finish it all. I totally went into this thinking I'd eat half and save the rest for dinner...but nope once you start you just can't stop. Cuz it's DELICIOUS. We tried chicken kebab and the beef/lamb shawarma. It's all good. 

I knocked it down because I found a hair in the salad :( But the food is legit so I'd be willing to come back and try again and hope this was a one time occurence."}
{"text":"My falafel sandwich was delicious! It was fresh, satisfying, and well worth the price. It didn't even get soggy when I tucked the second half into my bag while I checked out a store nearby for a half hour. The second half was just as good as the first. Definitely opt in when asked if you want it spicy!"}
{"text":"Ordered beef shawarma and while it was well seasoned it was the worst I've ever had.

I suspect the cooks are just from a country I've never tried shawarma from but I'm not a fan whatsoever. 

Ended up throwing the rest of it out.

Try it out if commuting and in area anyways otherwise there are better options within driving distance."}
{"text":"My new go-to place. The portions are a little smaller than most shawarma places, but the food's delicious. It's small and stifling hot in there, but it's really quick, so it's better for take out."}
{"text":"Ordered their Beef shawarma wrap combo with lentil soup and a bottle of water. Tasty and filling meal at a reasonable price. Good alternative to McDo or Taco Bell. Bad thing is there are no tables to sit down and eat. You could eat at one of the mall benches or take your food to the food court tables."}
{"text":"There's just something so disheartening about aggressively mediocre food. It's not bad enough to really get upset, nor is it good enough to provoke any real enthusiasm. It's just...there.

Habiba provides just such an experience.

I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap, which comes adorned with all the usual toppings one expects from such a concoction. I asked for mine without pickled turnips and with extra hot sauce.

After preparing the wrap, the cook placed it in a panini press and left it in there for about 30 seconds. This move left me scratching my head, since that amount of time isn't even remotely enough to make any difference.

The wrap itself is fine. Some of the chicken pieces were vaguely crispy, and the sauces and toppings were good (if completely lazy and uninspired). But the whole thing just felt sloppily assembled, with the lack of cohesion resulting in a wrap that was different from bite to bite (i.e. some contained just chicken, while others tasted only of lettuce and tomato).

There are ultimately too many superior options for similar fare in this area for me to consider going back to Habiba."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Very quick service. Was in and out in 5 minutes with 2 orders
- Decent portion for the price
- Pretty tasty for the most part

Cons:
- None

Ordered:
$9.99 Chicken Shawarma Plate - I was pretty surprised and happy for the most part. No real complaints 

Conclusion:
Came here craving some shawarma. When I entered, there were about 3 people ahead of me. Ended up getting my food and paying 5 minutes later so props for quick service. 

I was happy with the food for the most part. My only comment would be that I wish the portion was a bit bigger. I still felt a bit hungry afterwards. There wasn't much rice and meat compared to other places I've been to. But then again, I might just be (probably am) a fatty. I would recommend Habiba."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall but their chicken is nice and juicy. They have a $5.95 lunch special but if you ask them to replace the rice and potatoes in the special for a salad they will tell you it is no longer a special and will charge you $11.95--- so I paid the price for choosing veggies over carbs ;-P
Great for a quick grab and go though they do have limited seating in the back."}
{"text":"This place USED to be good when it was Ali Baba's, but now an independent owner took over and the food has gone downhill. The only reason I went was because it was too cold to walk to Chinatown for lunch and this place was right around the corner from the office. I ordered the $5 quarter chicken. The chicken portion was tiny, the meat was dry and burnt on the outside. It barely had any seasoning. It came with your choice of rice and I went with the lentil rice - that was ok. And the side salad was just some romaine pieces and pink turnip, some sort of dressing was squirted on top - but the salad looked dirty and unappealing that I didn't even want to eat it. I can't comment on their wraps and they do have daily specials. As I was eating my meal, I did see people come in the restaurant to order the wraps, so maybe those aren't too bad. But in my opinion, there's so many other options in the area and I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! I order the same thing everytime and it keeps getting better! I order the falafel plate and the falafels are moist and tasty!"}
