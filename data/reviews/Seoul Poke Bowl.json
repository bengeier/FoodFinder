{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, for sure.

I hope this isn't owned by another Seoul place in town. Ha! 

Anyway, the Wicked Tuna was good but the tuna seemed like it was cut with a borderline dull knife, some pieces were still attached to each other- and not uniform in shape. Honor the fish, man. Ponzu sauce on the bowl isn't a bad move but nothing sticks to the fish so it all drowns on the bottom leaving the bland tuna.

The amount of hot Cheetos that is sprinkled on this thing is mad disrespectful. I'm talking maybe a teaspoon or two, bro. You can't tell me hot Cheetos are expensive, you just can't. More would've definitely added elevated texture and pleasant crunch/heat/flavor throughout the bowl. 

The yellow Korean daikon was a power move and very fucking good addition, seaweed salad is too. Can't complain about the white onion and scallions either.

I've got no problem with the portion size. It is pricey but I will just end up coming less frequently so I don't spend a fortune here. Instead of spending $15 here every day. 

The fountain drinks here have an aftertaste of tap water/garden hose water, yo. 

Anyway, bring ya mama here. Bring ya aunty here."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and homemade sauces make this place a delicious combination. Really enjoyed the wonton chips with wasabi aioli!"}
{"text":"First visit for lunch.  Place is bright and clean (it is new) and menu is clearly displayed with granular description of items right behind the ordering counter.  The system is like other semi-fast-food restaurants where you order over a counter, they prep the food in front of you, and you pay at the end.  We did not wait at all for our food.  The servings were ok in size. I have read other comments about them being somewhat small. They are not that small but not huge. I think the issue is more that they serve you in a plastic disposable bowl, whether you eat in or take out. The serving looks small than it is because of the disposable bowl. The prices are a bit high considering you are being served on throw-away plastic bowls and cups.  The overall cost of 2 lunches with ice teas was $34.  This is a bit high especially given you are not in a super special area of town and you are being served on plastic-ware.   This place is mostly really for takeout. I think they can sit maybe 24 people and some of that is on a shared bar type area. On our visit we saw several folks standing around waiting for a table.   The food was good but I think it needs some fine tuning. Specifically, I ordered the top end bowl which had tuna, yellowfin (more tuna) and salmon.  The yellowfin tuna was almost frozen. Yet, it all tasted good. They do have a variety of iced teas with Asian flavors like Mango, green tea, etc.  I will probably give them another try but not sure yet this would be a regular type place yet given the amount of options out there for poke and other Asian type bowls."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! Could eat Poke Bowl every day. The Bulgogi is amazing and the Kim chi is fantastic. Super friendly environment. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this place to open... the restaurant is new and clean. I think I went the day the opened so you got that. The menu options are good but the prices are just too high. Ended up paying almost 16 dollars for a small bow of rice (no drink) with a small portion of seafood. While the place looks great and the food is decent, it's on the expensive side for a casual lunch place.  I hope management works on the menu and pricing so they do well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the tree hugger in me just can't give five stars to a business that serves food in plastic disposable bowls, takeout or not. How much plastic garbage do they generate per day? The image of this ginormous plastic garbage patch floating in the ocean just doesn't sit well with the fish chunks in my bowl (note to myself: I should probably quit eating fish if I truly care about marine life).

One of the signature bowls is the classic Bibimbap bowl. It's traditionally served in a stone bowl which retains heat better than a regular bowl. I have had it in regular bowls too but serving it in a plastic bowl is just wrong. Did I mention the bowl is very undersized? You can't mix everything up without spilling all over the place since the bowl is so small. 

When you build your own bowl, the least expensive option is $10.95 for 2 proteins with base and toppings. I don't have a big appetite so 2 proteins (or double portions of 1 protein) is more than I really want. It would be great if a one protein option for less than 10 bucks is offered."}
{"text":"I have went here twice  and have had two signature bowls. The seoul poke special  and the ohana sake, both were great but ohana i feel was more balanced.  The bowl was mixed with fresh salmon and crab but the wasabi aioli  sauce made the dish perfect. The 1st time I dined in the staff was extremely friendly. The restaurant was clean everything was fresh and over all it was a great experience. This last time I had take out and the food looked just as fresh and delicious as it was when I dined in. They had a new item  musubi on the menu which i also ordered.  I must say that is the 1st time I ever had it and it was delicious. It was a large role of rice mixed with seaweed warm with sweet egg and Spam wrapped in seaweed and it was delicious. I believe they are the only place in Charlotte that has that. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke bowl place in Charlotte so far. I was a little worried some of it would be a little gimmicky (like the spicy Cheetos topping), but it was fantastic. I wouldn't have even guessed that was in my tuna bowl. The fish was delicious, and you end up with a really nice portion of premium ingredients. I've been to too many places where you get 80% rice.

I'd also recommend getting some of their teas, which were also great. But prepare for lunch to come in just under $20 ($13 bowl + $2.50 for a drink + tax/tip got me to $18)."}
{"text":"I finally decided to go check out Seoul Poke Bowl last week for the first time. I ordered a custom bowl add avocado and one musubi. My bowl was brown rice, spicy tuna, salmon, edamame, masago, scallions, mango, avocado, eel sauce, and a small bit of sweet wasabi aioli.

Pros:
-Plenty of parking
-Portion was huge. Super full before I even finished.
-The musubi was absolutely fantastic. I don't even like spam but I decided to order it based on the raving reviews. So glad I did. Basically its rice, spam, egg, and seasoning. So good!
-Everything was super fresh and tasty!

Cons:
-Confusing ordering system- I walked in and immediately felt intimidated because the ordering system is weird. There isn't alot of info on choices. There was a small list to the side of sauces, but I had no clue what these sauces were. I feel like there needs to be just a better way to guide people through the line. I was the only one there and I felt super rushed by the staff. Fortunately, it worked out for me cause everything tasted great. 
-Price. $16 without a drink for lunch is steep. I wish they had a smaller bowl size, which was cheaper, as I really didn't need that much food. $1.50 extra for avocado isn't too bad but I didn't think the amount of avocado I got justified the addition. 

Overall, I think Seoul Poke Bowl is going to make a great addition to our neck of the woods. The food was super delish and filling!"}
{"text":"At Seoul Poke Bowl, I had one of the signature bowls, the Seoul Poke Special. This came with a variety of seafood including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. It also came with scallions, seaweed salad, cucumber, mango, Masago, edamame, avocado, and ponzu sauce. The fish tasted very fresh, and I really enjoyed the seaweed salad and mango especially. 

Keep in mind if you get this bowl, it will come VERY full. I had to ask for an extra bowl in order to be able to separate and mix the ingredients with the rice. While this bowl was tasty, I ended up preferring the salmon and tuna and had a lot of yellowtail left over. Having so much fish was rather overpowering so I think next time I will just make my own bowl to my own preferences. But if you're not sure about what ingredients you like, or what combinations taste good together, going with a pre-chosen signature bowl will help you figure out what you like. 

Overall I really enjoyed my experience at Seoul Poke Bowl. The staff was very helpful as well and were happy to chat about the store's progress and their menu. If you're in Charlotte and looking for a good poke restaurant, definitely drop by!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing! Loved the shrimp tempura bowl! The restaurant is very clean. However, we didn't receive a warm welcome, the staff is very unfriendly and cold! They did not seem happy to be at work. I would definitely go back though, but for takeout. Would've given 5 stars if they had better attitudes."}
{"text":"I literally go here once a week. The staff only picks on me a little bit lol. 

I've been dying for a spot like this to open for a while now and they really deliver! Always fresh ingredients, good pricing and they always give you a hearty amount.

They just started a loyalty punch card program which will benefit my addiction in the long run"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.The food is fresh and great quality. The portions are good especially for the price. The service was fast and friendly. The music was a little loud the day I went which makes ordering difficult especially when someone beside you is ordering too. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Slightly over priced for the quality of flavors. Portion size is nice. However, crammed in small bowls."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Seoul Powl Bowl. My brother and I created our own bowls, and my husband got the signature bibimbob bowl. It was ALL really good. The staff was helpful and the service was QUICK. The restaurant was also clean. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Seoul definitely surpassed expectations. My wife had the Pokerito and I had the traditional bowl. The bowl was awesome and they definitely give out healthy portions of sushi and have unique topping choices. My wife loved the Pokerito and how it came hand wrapped like a sushi roll. A little pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great experience with knowledgeable staff! A must try Poke place! The fish is fresh and sauce are so flavorful! If you like to create your own poke bowl, this is the place to be. Great selection of fresh fish and vegetables! Also, their flavor tea are this best! Try it, definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Excellent addition to Southend! Delicious food and quick for lunch! I love their seaweed salad and the fish is always fresh. I eat here a couple times a month!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Very good food...Its a new restaurant that has amazing, knowledgeable employees.  Stuffed avocados are the best."}
{"text":"Good poke.  I think that's what they're going for.  They tried to upsell me on dessert.  I didn't bite."}
{"text":"This place has some good, fresh poke! I have been twice since they opened and both were impressive. On my first visit I had a brown rice bowl with salmon and crab salad, but on my recent visit o decided to try one of the featured bowls, the soft shell crab poke bowl and boy am I glad I did! If you like crab you must give this one a try! To. Die. For. I will have to return to try some others!"}
{"text":"Good but pricy for the portions.  Location is convenient.  Unlikely to go again, because of high cost."}
{"text":"Finally bit the bullet and decided to give this whole 'poke' concept a try. I'm glad I waited because the restaurant was able to give me excellent quality food & service (i.e. work out any new business kinks), but I'm also so made that I've waited this long to experience the goodness that is a Poke bowl. 

Being a novice, I decided it was best to select from one of their pre-created menu items. Knowing me, my BYO-bowl would have turned into a hodge-podge of awfulness.  I opted for the 'Ohana Sake' signature bowl over white rice, and it was cray cray in the best way. Salmon, Spicy Crab, Scallions, Masago, Dried Onion, Kim Chi, Avocado & Cucumber served with a homemade sweet wasabi aioli. They let you mix it up a bit if you want to substitute, so I got the citrus ponzu sauces on the bowl and asked for the wasabi on the sauce. The bowl was an absolute home run. And that wasabi sauce? Ask for extra, because it needs to go on all the foods. 

My perfect bowl would be the Ohana Sake, but with mango or pineapple in lieu of the kim chi. That, mixed with the sweetness of the wasabi sauce & ponzu is going to create the trifecta perfecta. 

The owner (I think?) came around and actually gave us free wonton chips & wasabi aioli sauce. Not sure if this is a regular thing or he was feeling generous, but it was thoughtful and a nice addition to the meal. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, fast, and easy. It was my first time trying them out and I was super hangry and a bit worried a bowl wouldn't be enough food. I got the Ohana Sake (I think that's what it was called) and not only was it super tasty but was also super filling. I ended up with half a bowl of leftovers. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food and staff. I was skeptical at first because I'm not a huge sushi or raw fish person and my wife came and loved it. I made my own bulgogi beef and spicy pork bowl with rice, bean sprouts, sweet onion, corn, scallions all topped with Mango Chili sauce. It was really really good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good food, but it can get kind of pricey with add ons. I can get a similar bowl for a few bucks cheaper at other poke places, but they do have some options other places don't. I just wish things like the noodles and stuff for poke wrap/tacos weren't even more."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear about the plethora of Poke restaurants opening in Charlotte. After purely living on poke in Maui, I've been desperately craving it ever since! A friend and I decided to give Seoul a try after all the hype and were both left underwhelmed. The prices are high for the amount of actual fish received in the dish and everything felt.. mushy? I got food poisoning almost immediately after and my friend threw away half her dish. I usually do like to give establishments some time to adjust after opening, but after the food poisoning, I don't think I want to risk it."}
{"text":"This was my first poke bowl experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it! 

The staff were very patient with my friend and I and even let me sample the spicy Cheeto topping. I had the King Wicked Tuna (hold the Cheetos) and overall thought it was great, the ponzu sauce was a little salty for me, but that may just be the way ponzu sauce is. 

ALSO, the juices are amazing!!! There are several fresh, creative flavors to choose from. My lemonade was so flavorful and fairly sweet (which I like)."}
{"text":"Good food...Bad service....unnecessarily rude staff....food was fresh and had nice flavor...i got the King Wicked Tuna Bowl...they upcharge for every single addition you request. Staff was very short and not helpful to my mother at all while she was trying to figure out what she wanted. This was her 1st time there, she simply just had questions and wanted suggestions. He was not helpful in the least bit and was very sarcastic and condescending. I will be back maybe, but with a new poke place opening in the university area it will be hard to sell me on this place if they are comparable taste wise with better service. My mom says she will not be patronizing this place anymore. See you poor service can effect your profit, get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Finally a solid Poke place has arrived in Charlotte. The establishment, while in a questionable strip mall, was bright and airy, displaying all of the fresh ingredients right in front of you.  While it was expensive, the portions and flavors made it all worth it.  I ordered the Seoul Poke special and it was delicious. It was cumbersome to eat as the bowl was packed to the brim. While it is their most expensive offering, the bowl was filled with three different fish, mango, seaweed, edamame and other toppings i can not remember. The sweetness of the mango paired so well to the saltiness of the seaweed, while the lettuce and rice were the perfect base to deliver every single bite. The staff were eager and willing to accommodate my every desire.  They did not rush nor express any disdain in my indecisiveness. 

The bottomline: Seoul Poke Bowl is worth the splurge."}
{"text":"After dining at several poke bowl restaurants around Charlotte, this one is definitely my favorite. In my experience, it gives the largest portions and has the freshest fish, and the variety of toppings is solid. It's weird to me that other poke restaurants I've been to don't add furikake to the rice (at no additional cost)... it makes SUCH a flavor difference! I also enjoy that Seoul has interesting specials like spam musubi and chicken katsu. The mango green tea is also SUPER good! I'm always satisfied with a full belly walking out of this place. The location is a little funky and the service is just alright, but those factors won't deter me from coming here often. It's clear that the owners are proud of this place - with the high quality of their product, it shows!

Tip: If you're stumped on sauces, I recommend the unagi (eel) sauce - equally savory and sweet!"}
{"text":"Nice little Korean /Pacific fusion restaurant.  Went with the Classic Bimbimbap and was not disappointed.  Tow options of rice, option to replace the beef with a pork protein.  The service was polite and friendly.  Prices were a bit higher than I would expect but, all in all, well worth it - despite the fact I had to endure Justin Bieber piped through their speakers!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place is! I have only seen this type of place out west before. In essence, it's a build your own bowl concept, but Asian fusion (you can also get Hawaiian Poke).  Of course I love any restaurant where I can choose every single component of my dish.  Some highlights of this place:

1.  Multiple fresh vegetable toppings. At other restaurants like this that I have been to, there may be three or four vegetable selections... This one must've had 10 fruit and vegetable selections, including fresh mango!

2.  Your bowl comes with two proteins, not one. I chose tofu and chicken. It was not busy, and when the guy noticed I did not really like the look of the tofu, he offered to flash fry it for me on the spot.

3.  I like that there were choices beyond Asian sauces. I find a lot of them to be too salty, and the citrus vinaigrette that they offered was just perfect for me.

4.  Once I finished eating, one of the employees came to my table and removed the tray. A nice touch for a quick service place.

I look forward to returning the next time I am on business travel in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Seoul Poke Bowl. The employees were warm and welcoming and the layout of the restaurant was neat and inviting. Like many others ahead of me in line, I chose to go the Build Your Own Bowl route with 2 proteins. I was pleased with the generous scoops I received and the quality of the ingredients. I selected wonton chips as my base and as an added bonus they had just been replenished and were fresh out of the fryer! Try not to go overboard with the toppings as anything over 4 comes with a 0.50 up-charge (no biggie). The homemade sauces are an absolute MUST! Get them on the side or directly on your bowl but try them all!! The night of my visit they had a new mango chili sauce which packed a small kick but complemented my spicy tuna and salmon bowl well. From my experience I am sure Seoul Poke Bowl will have great success and I hope there are more locations to come!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal. A coworker told me about this resturant and at first, I thought to myself would a sushi bowl be any good? But it was! 

The restaurant was very clean and the staff were friendly. The menu was easy to read and all of the food is laid out so you can see it as your bowl being prepared. They also have a variety of drinks. I recommend the cucumber mint water. 

We arrived at around 6:45pm and there was hardly anyone there. This place is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Our first Poke experience. Delicious, fresh ingredients and great flavor. Staff was very nice and helpful in guiding our choices. Loved it!"}
{"text":"You have no idea how happy my Asian heart is knowing that the poké scene is spreading throughout Charlotte! I've lived in both Chicago & L.A. so I can get a little picky when it comes to Asian food. In my opinion, Seoul Poke Bowl is my number one pick so far. I've been to a few in Charlotte, and I think Seoul Poke Bowl gives you the most protein without dumping a whole bunch of rice in your bowl. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey...and they charge $1.50 for avocado. I get that avocado is expensive, but even standard $6 sushi rolls come with avocado so I personally don't think there should be a charge for it. Otherwise, I made my own poke bowl & I loved it! My husband had the king wicked tuna bowl & he loved it! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh bowls with a ton of options. Really tasty drink options too - e.g., cucumber mint water. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"So glad this place finally opened. I have been dying to try it out - and it was worth the wait. Very fresh ingredients, which is key with seafood. Friendly staff, quick service, and a very unique drink selection (which is great since it's not all sugary soda options)."}
{"text":"SO GLAD Charlotte finally has poke! As a lover of both poke and Korean food, I think this place rocks!

I visited on a Saturday for lunch and was quite impressed. The restaurant itself has a nice aesthetic -- bright, airy, and modern. At first I thought it was a chain because the branding looked so good, but after talking with the owner, I learned that it isn't (yet) but that he hopes to expand eventually. Cool -- we could use more poke around Charlotte!

The staff were super friendly and helpful. My parents are new to poke bowls and the staff helped them through the process, patiently explaining the various toppings and even letting them sample sauces and toppings they were curious about. 

They have a good variety of options to customize your poke bowl, with proteins such as fresh fish, bulgogi, and tofu and unique toppings such as kimchi, wasabi peas, and flaming hot cheetos. The sauces are great as well, my favorite being the Seoul Soyu sauce -- so much umami flavor. The prices are reasonable, especially considering how much food you get. One bowl with 2 proteins was PLENTY of food for me. 

Ultimately, the Korean flair is what really sets this poke place apart from other places I've been. I've had a lot of great poke in California, but this place is just as good. Such a great restaurant that adds more diversity the Charlotte food scene!"}
{"text":"Being on a mission to try all the new Poke places in town, I've been to Seoul Poke Bowl a couple of times. 

The 1st time suffering from a long day at the office the hustle & bustle & busyness was a little off putting in such a small space.   Taking it home was it was the perfect bite even the spicy Cheetos were a welcome surprise on the King Tuna bowl.

2nd time a little less busy which for me was a breath of fresh air - I didn't feel rushed to make a decision which maybe that would've helped since my choice this time was not quite what I expected - the Surf & Turf Bowl.  It was like bay shrimp & white meat chicken.  User error - not what I was expecting.  I'm not a fan of either.  Thought it would be beautiful big shrimp like duh inch close enough to look in the case.  Still enjoyable not as good as the Wicked King Tuna bowl :) 

Love the variety of options & some of the quirks like the spicy Cheetos!

Can't wait for the next time I'm in the area to hit up Seoul & try another one of the standard offerings."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place out since I heard rumors of its opening! I was so pumped to walk into a ultra clean, fresh, modern place. The idea is something I have been wanting someone to break into! 

It's simple build your own bowl or select one of the preset creations. You can select 2 or 3 proteins then you get 4 toppings included. Avocado is an extra $1.50 but that ok in my book! The staff was so friendly. They let us try multiple sauces. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious. 

The one lone reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I do think that your toppings should include a free crunch... I don't think this should be counted in the 4 toppings. I also don't think scallions/sesame seeds should be considered a topping... it should be complimentary. 

The pricing overall isn't bad for the portions. They don't offer any mainstream sodas but they do have lots of juices/teas. 

The manager came out and gave us some chips and sauce to try which is a great way to keep people coming back. I'll def be returning but I do hope they end up adding the free crunch!"}
{"text":"WHOOOOOOOOO. That should be my whole review haha jk. I have been waiting and anticipating this place for nearly 6 month when I heard that it was coming. And guess what? It was WORTH THE WAIT! Exceeded my expectations of poke bowls. I was in Colorado, Vegas, Northern California, and I was intrigued with what's so trendy out west, they always gets the best things first out west, but I think Seoul poke bowl might be charlottes winner. Every other Poke bowl out west is basically a dissembled sushi roll. It's basically rice and raw fish lol doesn't sound too appealing right? Right? But Seoul Poke Bowl CHANGED THE GAME, and set the bar high, they took a gamble by infusing KOREAN FLAVORS into a Hawaiian style dish with some of the BEST JAPANESE/Korean flavored sauces to finish these bowls off. That's why they really Stand out to me. And I'm taking the time out to write long review. I'm truly in love and addicted with everything this place has to offer. Starting with the Hawaiian musubis that's like a spam and egg nigiri  sooooo freaking magical the combination of flavors in every bite!   Build your own bowls which I normally do for lunch time when I'm in a hurry, they get me trough the line in under 5 mins and the place is always packed, yet still SUPER FAST and I normally choose a signature bowl like their Korean bagulgi ... uhhh how ever you spell that lol got great beef flavors and it's topped with a sunny side up egg the combination is simply perfect. And drinks. They do not offer ANY SODAS NONE NOT ONE SINGLE SODA nope. Bet you think it's a bad thing right? It's the best thing EVER they make these great flavor teas that's super original and ALOT healthy yet still super delicious. My favorite is the passion fruit lemonade, and I mix it with mint green tea, kinda. Create my own refreshment"}
{"text":"Finally made it waaay out to this place. Not super convenient but I'll just have to get over it. The staff was really helpful and offered great suggestions. You could tell they knew their stuff and were pleased with the product. We went with the King Wicked Tuna, Seoul Poke Special (with added crab salad), spam musubi (interesting!), passionfruit lemonade (sooo good!) and lychee lemonade that we were told was a new, fresh batch. The food came out quickly and tables were small 2 tops - perfect. Also, staff came around and cleaned the dining room a few times (the space was impeccably clean).  The food was excellent, fresh & piled high (I was full when I left but it looked like I hadn't taken a bite).  Self-serve drink fountains next to the door was a nice touch, the different shades of juices almost looked like art pieces in the white space. And you'll keep topping off your drink because this stuff is amazing! Flaming hot Cheetos as a topping in one of the bowls was a fun touch. This is the furthest poke restaurant for me to get to but I'll be back (or cross my fingers that it'll show up on Postmates!). Extremely pleased with every aspect of this place."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good bowl of poke.  I tend to prefer making my own at home, but I am thrilled to have a \"chipotle-style\" poke restaurant nearby with tons of toppings.

Overall, I really like it.  The fish and toppings were tasty and fresh.  I loved the variety of options that can go into your bowl.  You can get a base of brown rice, white rice, salad or in a wrap.

I knocked one star off because everything is served in disposable plastic. How about offering options for to-go versus staying so that I'm not throwing away heaps of garbage?  It's also a bit pricey - I know fresh fish is expensive, but the premium toppings (who wouldn't request avocado????) really push these bowls pretty high."}
{"text":"Delicious! Big chunks of fish, amazing tacos, and u have to try their fried avocado stuffed with crab! Wish they had more seating. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"**Pro tip, follow them on social media. They try different concepts and offer them to the public on a first come, first serve basis. On Monday they tried out a Korean short rib bowl. It was Ono!** 
     I've been to SPB for lunch about three times now and they haven't disappointed. As soon as you walk in, you'll notice that the decor is very clean and modern. The tables can fill up fast but I usually take my bowl to go anyways. Every time my coworkers and I come in the staff of SPB are very friendly and will give you suggestions if your not sure what to get to fit your palette. Since Poke is getting popular here in Charlotte, its nice to have a place to go to with familiar flavors to me. The veggies and the marinade for a lot of the proteins have a very Korean flavor. It works nicely together in the poke bowl since local Hawaiian food is melting pot of a lot of different Asian cultures anyway. It really does reminds me of back home. The fish is fresh and since I like my bowls spicy I always get jalapeños and the Korean gochujjang sauce. But you can always try out the different sauces they offer to find what fits you. 
     But honestly, in my opinion the star of their menu so far is the spam musubi. I know what you're thinking, \"spam?!? What the f...\" the thing you have to understand is spam is a stable of Hawaiian food and culture for decades now. Growing up I was never a fan of spam on its own, which is weird because I'm a Korean American who grew up in Hawaii, and those two cultures love spam! But I can eat musubi all day. The musubi has a blanket of tamago (egg) rice with furikake sprinkled in, Spam (of course) maybe in a shoyu dressing(?) wrapped in seaweed. All individually wrapped so you can eat on the go.. people will just look at you weird because your eating something that looks like a spam sushi, but if this was Hawaii, the locals would might ask where you got it because everyone has their favorite place to get musubi. 
    All in all, if you're a fan of fresh fish, crisp veggies and want it all in a convenient to go bowl, stop by Seoul Poke Bowl. Try the spam musubi and follow them on social media so you don't miss out on their special bowl creations before it goes public. I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Poke, fairly wide variety of ingredients, friendly and quick service. Great place!"}
{"text":"This was a nice spot along South Boulevard. Brightly lit with a fairly nice staff. There were a wide variety of toppings including a starch, protein and veggies served with delicious toppings. I got the greens, spicy pork, edamame, corn, red onions rice noodles and a few other veggies with a delicious cream sauce to top it off. Yum!  I enjoy getting healthy fast food! It was a little pricey but that's the way it goes with eating healthy! I will go again."}
{"text":"Yummy and filling! The bowl looks small but it's actually a big portion when they fill it."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!  If it was closer to me, I'd probably visit every other day.  The employees are always extremely friendly, they never skimp on the fish, and there are a ton of sides. Plus, the prices are super affordable for poke.  I always get the King Wicked Tuna -- highly recommend! It comes with spicy Cheetos on top... enough said."}
{"text":"Service was fast, went around 12pm on a Friday! Great people. Plenty of poke in a bowl, full to the brim. Wish that the bowls would be bigger so I could shake or maneuver around the toppings without spilling though. I got the Ohana Sake bowl for around $14 including tax, definitely worth it especially with their fresh ingredients. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing Poke bowl the best in Charlotte hands down! I got the Salmon and crab mixture in my bowl and it was so good! Very clean and nice staff"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan and will return. I went with my BF last night and we both did a build your own. I wanted to do a preset bowl with tuna instead of salmon bc there are no substitutes of protein on the preset bowls (even though they aren't pre-made which is a bit annoying but alas, I was happy with my end choice). I got a mix of spicy tuna with shrimp and loaded up on my favorite picks and paid extra for avocado ($1.50). My BF did the same with tuna and crab and got seaweed salad for extra $1.50.   It was a good meal. The price is about what it would have been for two people at a sushi dinner so I was okay paying $37 for two bowls and two drinks. 

The only thing I wish was different is the size of the bowls. Not the portion sizes, they are great but my tip is to order, take it home and throw your food into a much bigger bowl so you can actually mix it up and enjoy all the chosen ingredients together. Or they could just provide bigger bowls.  

We will return for sure.  But we will most likely take it to go."}
{"text":"Great place for a poke bowl BUT not service. 

There is a wide variety of selections in every category. They pack in the ingredients into you bowl so it is a hearty serving; you can expect a filling meal. Very fast and efficient process in building the bowl. I put one star less due to two factors. One it was not friendly customer service more just want to take your order and get you out (not one smile). Two in my visit there was a homeless individual in the store asking each customer for a bowl. This person even first asked the workers for just a bowl of rice. The individual was being nice but very insistent.  All of the workers and manager were completely hands off and ignored the situation. It took a customer to treat the homeless individual to a bowl that helped the situation.  It is a very uncomfortable environment when the store workers and manager do nothing to aid a potential customer in need or give support to the purchasing customers.

I want to give a three stars due to this negative service experience but the food was great. If you want a good poke bowl to try and don't care much about service, since it is like 'subway style' setup, then 4 stars. If you care about the whole experience plus food then 3 stars. 

Next time I want a poke bowl I am checking out other locations before returning here. If I return, it would just then be take out.

Other reviews have been positive. This might have been a single event but it did affect my opinion. If I go again and experience it differently, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Good food and fun concept; unfortuantely, it is a bit pricey.  My bowl was $17 and I had water as a drink."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Seoul Poke Bowl before we headed to National Whitewater for the day. Wanted something filling but not heavy and this was exactly what we needed. 

My husband had the Classic Bibimbap with his go-to, Musubi  and I did the build your own bowl with tuna, pork and Bulgogi.  I asked for Masago but she apparently heard Mango ... nevertheless it wasn't horrible - just pushed what I couldn't eat to the side. Portions were spot on and everything tasted fresh. 

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Considering it's Poke, the price is definitely justifiable. I think when it comes to fresh fish and you don't live next to the ocean, it should be a little pricey. You wouldn't want to eat cheap sushi right? I mean, I guess you could if it's all cooked, but if it's raw I would think that's a pretty ballsy move. Seoul Poke Bowl definitely gives a different take on traditional poke that's served in Hawaii (not that I know from personal experience, but from what I've had it's pretty simplistic). 

Poké is pretty much if Chipotle style of fast food had a baby with sushi. Now add in a mix of Korean, and that's Seoul Poke Bowl. They have wider varieties depending on what you want. If you don't feel so hot about their default bowls, then make one yourself! I promise, it's pretty hard to pick incorrect stuff that won't go well together. I think every option gives a unique flavor and depth to your poké bowl. 

I got the Seoul Poke Special, and it was pretty good. I just wish there were more proteins. I was thinking of building my own, but with that decision my bowl would've been easily $20 as I would've loaded the crap out of it. So rather doing that, I just went with their signature bowl. It was tasty, and they load you up on the fish and if you get it with rice, you'll for sure have enough to eat. I ate it with base of salad (you can choose your base if you choose signature as well!) and it filled me up for the rest of the day until dinner.

I would definitely recommend people to come here for poké, and it was about time that Charlotte got a spot for it. I'm waiting for more spots to open up. Also! They have Pokéritos as well, which are poké burritos. It's definitely something to check out if you've never had one before.

Last thing: It's not a 5 star because the avocados were a little old. Nothing wrong with the taste, I still ate all of it, but the color was a little discolored and it was a honest mistake. Seoul Poké Bowl needs to know how many people come in before they get everything right. Definitely still a recommendation if you're looking for something light and new!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Charlotte! Poke bars are the new fro yo and have been popping up all over town recently. This place is more expensive than the new Poke place over by Mama Ricotta's but the quality is much better! And you get more fish for the price (even if it is slightly more expensive, they are very generous with their portions which I love)! Do yourself a favor and skip the other spots around town and only go here! When it comes to sushi/poke you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It is so good and fresh. I got the Ohana sake with seed wrap, and it is delicious. It will be my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Best poke bowl I've ever had! Taste fresh, full of flavor and I want another bowl right now!! And the MUSUBI is a must try!!"}
{"text":"The wait and anticipation for Seoul Poke Bowl has ended as Seoul opened its doors today and they definitely did not disappoint!  I had the Seoul Poke Special which included yellowtail, salmon, and tuna and it was the perfect balance and flavor.  I def tasted the freshness of the protein and toppings (avocado and mango - YUM).  Compared to other poke bowl shops around the Charlotte area, I definitely received a lot more protein in an order since the slices of sashimi were pretty BIG but perfect size in an easy to eat bowl.  They also offer their own fresh made beverages (pineapple juice, passion fruit, green and ice tea, etc.) and the refills are free -  big PLUS.  I'll swing by for lunch again to try out other bowls since the location is close uptown."}
{"text":"Colorful, fresh, and convenient. The only thing that could make a meal from Seoul Poke Bowl better is a big frozen drink from the nearby QT!

Recent addition just steps away from the Scalybark blue line light rail station, I stopped in here late-December for some takeout dinner. I appreciated being able to choose two different proteins with their standard build-your-own bowl and getting the sauce on the side. Clean, efficient, and easy parking, this place will be even more popular as the apartments and town homes spread further down South Blvd to get closer to the brewery district begrudgingly referenced as LoSo (Olde Meck, Sugar Creek, etc). 

Do you like poke or want to try it in burrito form? Get on over to Seoul Poke Bowl when you just don't have the energy or creative brainpower to make anything, but still want something to do your body right."}
{"text":"I'm in line at TWC Spectrum, number 8 in line. Let's see how fast it moves!

Seoul Poke Bowl is good, but expensive. That's what I tell people. I LOVED my custom made, subway selection style poke bowl. I love poke! This place is set up like a Subway sandwich shop. Plastic to go containers, to go condiments by the front door. Walk to the back of the store, tell them what you want, add this and that, pay (lots of money). Simple enough. The food is fresh, I was hoping it would be - old raw fish is not my style. But it's fresh! And delicious! The sprouts were drowned in water, and looked soggy, so just take a glance at what you're ordering before they throw it in your beautiful bowl. 

Price. It's steeper than I like. And I appreciate, and happily pay for fresh food. But this is P-R-I-C-E-Y. My custom bowl was $16, doesn't look like you could get out of there with a bowl less than $13. So, choose wisely. And just assume that everything is extra. On a positive note, I was full for the rest of the afternoon. But I felt poorer for it...

But enjoy it while you eat it! If they were cheaper, I'd be here all the time. So maybe it's good for my wallet? Come here on payday, or to celebrate something. 

Also, how do you pronounce \"poke\"? I've always said \"poke-ay\"... Hmmm. 

And, if you're wondering. I'm not number 6 in line at TWC. Another review it is!!"}
{"text":"Omg love this place! Location was ok but the food was great and fast service! They were very welcoming and friendly. I would defin come back soon! Me and my boyfriend enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"The most important part of poke for me is the freshness of ingredients. I'm glad to report that both veggies and fish tasted fresh.

As you can figure out from the name, this poke place has a Korean spin on it. So there are some Korean ingredients that you might not expect if you had traditional poke in mind. 

There are preset signature poke bowl options. Just know you can't do substitutions. You can also build your own bowls with 2 or 3 proteins. If you like a lot of different toppings it can get expensive quickly. Whether that it worth it, that's up to your taste."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best compared to the other poke places in town, but what really turned me off is the unfriendly staff. The person that was serving us was not attentive, irritated by questions, and seemed like it was a terrible day for him. I will not go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Really cool place. The misubi and the tempura elote are both must haves. Maybe it's just me, but I think it would be so much better if customers were given the option to have all their ingredients mixed with the sauce and then placed on top of their preferred base of rice lettuce etc. The bowls look super pretty and colorful, but the only way I was able to eat mine was to dump the top half in a larger bowl at home, mix it up, then dump it back on top of the rice. The quality of the ingredients was A1. The staff were super nice and helpful. But, at $50 for two bowls, 1 app, 1 side, and 2 ice teas, I just don't want to do any work on my food when it's time to eat!"}
{"text":"Omg! Probably the most amazing thing I put in my mouth! It's exactly what I expected! Shout out to Anthony! - the service was great, the food down to the sauce was amazing, and the drinks- you cant find them anywhere else! I think I become obsessed with this place! The only problem I have is that it isn't closer to me!!! :'( I definitely recommend everyone to check out this place!"}
{"text":"Made the drive up South Blvd from Fort Mill this afternoon.....SOOOOO worth the drive!....great staff, super clean, every bit of food was amazingly fresh....and super tasty....wish it was a bit closer.... but (wink wink) you never know, might come closer to Fort Mill!...
Make a visit, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  So excited to have this Korean/Hawaiian fusion in Charlotte.  I tried the Poke bowl and just created my own combination.  Had bulgogi beef, brown rice, onions, edamame, salmon, jalapeno, cilantro and tried several of their sauces: ginger sauce, spicy mayo and soy sauce.  Also, their juices are fantastic!  My favorite was the mango-lemonade!"}
{"text":"Wow. I'm keep going back because it is amazing and so fresh. Best oysters in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best poke in town... Only poke 2017.12.06

Poke was solid, the value proposition is what I struggled with, + seaweed salad  = extra, + avocado = extra. I understand that more ingredients = extra $$, but I don't think the amounts they add equates to pure enjoyment. 

3 proteins, plus premium ingredients = mucho dinero and still felt hungry.

Places similar to this in California were somehow less expensive. 

It's possible that the pre-built bowl is a better value, I just can't see the hot Cheetos as something I want to consume along side sashimi grade tuna."}
{"text":"Awesome welcome poke joint on S. Blvd. great toppings, ample portions... didn't skimp on fish. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place...nicely decorated. Very hip. I was a little confused by the menu. So, I played it safe and got the bibimbap. I was glad they sort of kept the dish authentic and put a Sunnyside up egg on top of the dish... It was okay... It lacked some spice and heat. Also, the bowl was a bit small and  shallow which meant the portion was small for the price.I'll go back and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Love this place! Was my first Poke Bowl and I was very pleased. The bowl looked a little small at first, but they pack it super full, and by the end I was struggling to finish it all. Definitely can not wait to go back for a second time!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my sister after a cardio dance class we were taking at Sugar Creek Brewing. We were looking for something light and healthy. This spot was perfect. It's a super casual atmosphere similar to a Chipotle style ordering restaurant. I also noticed several people picking up orders to take home.

Poke bowls are awesome! You can go low carb, but high protein and still get lots of flavor. I had a surf n' turf bowl over greens which had shrimp and chicken with pineapple, scallions, avocado, and some sauces. Delicious! I tried their special spam sushi roll (a homemade delicacy), but it wasn't for me. All of the food was fresh and authentic. We were served quickly and at around $11-13, the price was right."}
{"text":"I've totally hopped on the Poke Bowl bandwagon and I'm going broke in the process. Although it's a bit pricy, it's amazing how much high quality food Seoul packs into a bowl! Worth every dollar. 

When you walk in, the menu is super easy to understand for novices and experts alike. You can do one of their signature bowls or do a make-your-own. I personally like doing my own thing. You pick your base (rice or even salad if you're low carb). Pick a protein (they have non-fish options), and four veggies (generous portions) and pick a sauce! It's just that simple. By the end, you have a packed bowl of yumminess. They have a great variety of toppings so good luck making your choice!

If you're a first timer, just pick one of their signature bowls. You really can't go wrong. They have a ton of drink and cold tea options, too! Also from the time I walked in to the time I left, it was a Ne-Yo party on the radio, which was completely cool. There may or may not have been some singing under my breath."}
{"text":"So unbelievably good!! Great ingredients to choose from, quick to grab, amazing service and priced extremely reasonably. This is our go to choice for poke when we're craving it, you can't go wrong!! If you're wanting to try something new and authentic from Hawaii, try a Hawaiian power bar  spam, egg and rice- they eat these all the time in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I'm a newbie to poke bowls but Seoul made it easy and it was really good. I love sushi so I tried to make my favorite sushi rolls in a bowl and it paid off. It is like chipotle in that you order at the counter and pick the items to go in your bowl. I had brown rice, tuna, salmon, mango, cukes, carrots and masago. Their citrus dressing was perfect to dip in the side. As it's new, a few kinks to work out. There aren't enough tables currently but that's easy to improve. The beverage selection is limited to teas, juice and water. Wine and beer would be a nice upgrade. Wasabi was considered a topping so I didn't get any. That should be considered a complimentary condiment. And while the bowl looks small, it was surprisingly filling. I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot. Charlotte is a super healthy community but I really have a hard time finding healthy food options. The poke bowls are so fresh and can be made to order just how you like. There are so many combinations. The possibilities are endless. They also have a signature dish menu that take all the guess work out of ordering- they really nail it with these. I had the Ohana and I will 100% be getting this again. The space is small and it was pretty packed when I went to try to avoid direct rush times to get a seat."}
{"text":"Not your authentic Hawaiian poke bowl but from the name it seem their main focus was having a twist of Korean and Japanese spreads which I guess is their style.
I tried to create a tradition Poke bowl with what they had but it turned out okay. 

Overall my experience was disappointing. The Asian guy behind the bar fixing the bowls was very disrespectful. The guest I had with me was asking questions about the ingredients and that guy looked and talked back at my guest as he was stupid. That guy even asked back to my guest \"why would you ask that?\". 

Three stars from me."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick lunch. It's fast food poke and it's inland, so calibrate your expectations a little bit -- but that said, on the day I came at 3pm, everything tasted fresh and clean, vegetables crispy and fish is decent quality. Since it was my first time, I went all in for the special and it was a great blend, I was surprised how good the sweet mango was in there with all the fish and veggies. I'm not sure why people are complaining about portion sizes, I couldn't even finish all of mine and left feeling stuffed even after walking around in the cold all afternoon. Would eat again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy food. Great portions that doesn't leave you feeling like you need a nap afterwards. The drink options are also refreshing, the lychee lemonade paired perfect with my Super Soy bowl. I can't wait to come back, this restaurant is well needed in this area, and hopefully will be expanding soon."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Fish was nice and fresh and I love how they let you sample the sauces before they top off your poke bowl. Serving size was plenty for me, I left feeling full. I also love that they have kimchi available, it's not common at other poke places I've been."}
{"text":"I have been going consistently since it opened and it is the best poke place! The portions are generous and the staff is incredibly friendly. I usually do take out and I can put the entire bowl into a bigger bowl at home because it's so much food."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome place!! It was my husbands idea to come here, and I'm glad we did. Very modern and chill vibe, and a great concept. Let me say, we are kind of sushi (and Asian/eastern food) snobs ---- and the quality of the sushi here is AMAZING! I don't even like salmon, and this salmon was like butter, and not fishy at all. I ordered the Ohana Sake bowl (with spicy crab and salmon), and I added tuna. OMG phenomenal The onions and the sweet wasabi sauce were the perfect touch, and I loved the crab + salmon + tuna combo. The kimchee that was part of my bowl is pretty legit too. Umami is really a thing, because one of these bowls really can hit every taste bud and craving that you have!  My husband ordered the King Wicked Tuna, and he was all about those spicy Cheetos. He added spicy mayo and unagi sauce, and thought that it made it better. To sum it up, this place is totally worth a stop! Best part is, you can show up in your workout clothes and no one cares."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors.. this place is addicting!! My first time going.. they were very patient and let me try things before adding to my bowl.. they suggested sauces that went perfectly with my meal! They have different teas to try.. not just nasty soda .. I can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"You shouldn't go to Chipotle expecting authentic Mexican food like you get in Mexico. So you shouldn't come to this place and expect  authentic Poke bowls that you find in Hawaii. (Something I should have told myself prior to coming here.)

So what do you get for $10.99, a variety of quality fresh ingredients.  Customized bowls - Choose 4 veggies, 2 proteins and choice of sauce.  Think, the Chipotle of Poke. 

With that said, it was too hard for me not to get my hopes up as much as I love Poke. Which ultimately lead to my disappointment.  The sauce just didn't cover the way it does when the fish is actually marinated in it. But you cant do that and have a ton of different options and customizations. The 4 veggies were half the dish and not typical in a Poke bowl in Hawaii. The kim chee was great I just didn't want it with my Poke.  My favorite Poke Place in Hawaii offers bowls at  just $8.99 so paying $2 more for vegetables I didn't care for doesn't really appeal to me.

I will say that the Spam Musubi was better than any I had in Hawaii. I mean I don't really love spam and their flavored rice made it much more appealing to me. 

While high expectations were not met, I would go back just with different expectations.  Though with all the Poke places popping up, I am still hoping one gets a little closer to the authentic experience."}
{"text":"Aloha

Went to Hawaii for the first time this past year and found out about poke. Yes until visiting I was pronouncing it wrong. I quickly fell in love with the dish and have been craving it ever since.

I am in luck that this place popped up near my house.  Must say that they are a little on the pricey side. I opted for the 2 protein and it was 10.95.  They call it build your own and it is less expensive than their signature bowls at like 13+. So I asked for spicy tuna and yellowtail. Later noticed they gave me salmon instead of the spicy  tuna. No biggie because it was still good and my girlfriend shared her tuna with me. 

The toppings in my opinion are ok. You can have up to 4.  I went with cilantro,  daikon radish,  kimchi, and bean sprouts. They were all good but in my opinion lower the price and keep it simple with the protein and rice. The sauces were not bad. I went with the shoyu and also was able to try the ponzu that my gf got.  

Now for the close and the main reason I will be back. And I definitely will be back to get the spam  musibi. They are 2.95 but completely worth it. The rice even has the furikake in it.  That was the bomb and highly recommend trying one and you will not be disappointed. Great snack ! 

All in all I had a pleasant experijnce and happy to have this spot nearby

Mahalo"}
{"text":"Had to try the Poke crazy. Went for quick dinner take out. Place waa very clean and staff help move through the Poke making process. I got the Surf and Turf, figured I start off simple. Definitely great portion size. Enjoyed the dish, just wish rice was little warmer, overall great for my 1st Poke experience."}
{"text":"Finally, I had the opportunity to visit Seoul Poke Bowl! I've had this place bookmarked few weeks. 

I visited during lunch hour with a friend, the restaurant wasn't busy. Our food was ready within minutes! I appreciate the cleanliness and fresh appearance of the food. I'm sure they have a great health score (DUH). I choose to build my own Poke Bowl and BOY was it delicious!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about my order! 

My order:
Base: Salad Mix
Proteins: I selected the 2-Proteins for $10.95,  Spicy Tuna & Salmon
Toppings: You can pick 4!! Time to get creative!!!  I added a 5th topping- Seaweed salad for $1.50 extra. Daikon Radish, Cucumber, Carrots, Scallions.
Homemade Sauce: Firecracker Sauce (Basically Spicy Mayo)

The beverage station has dispensers with infused Teas and lemonades. I was pleased to see no soda/pop available! My total came to $16 and some odd change. I would've liked to spend less but I must say everything was worth the price. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is like subway for poke. They've got a great menu but if you wanna just look at the ingredients while they make it, you have that option. Everything is fresh & delicious and the staff is super knowledgeable & helpful. TRY THE MUSABI!!!! I love this place, I would give it 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see poke place started popping up in charlotte. This is located across the street from the scaley bark light rail station. My favorite part of the meal is the musubi, you gotta get it. It's sooo good. Sushi rice, with nori and rice seasoning. Ham and egg. 

Now onto the bowl, none of their sauces were that good. They dont give you much protein, understand, but made the experience very meh. Comparing with umami pokerito, this is not as good."}
{"text":"Love the things I got. The bulgogi bowl was really good. The little spam and rice rolls were pretty amazing and I got the bowl with all the fish(forgot what it's called) but it's pretty darn good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So fresh, so good! Lots of options and really friendly staff. So glad this is so close to work, it's going to be a lunchtime staple!"}
{"text":"What could be better then designing your own rice bowls!! Been here twice already and I'm so addicted!! Don't really get the the raw stuff but omg the bulgogi beef is my favorite. Sooo yummy. And they have so much toppings to choose from. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really cool little spot on South Blvd! I had never had Poke before and the staff was very helpful when it came to explaining the options and recommending tasty combinations. Food was very fresh, portions were substantial, and i left feeling satisfied- would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Lots of options to customize your own bowl! If you're nervous yours won't taste good, you can go off the menu and choose one of their recommended dishes. 

My order (featured in the pic with my review) was good. If you think it looks appetizing, this is what's all in it: 
- salad bowl
- spicy tuna and crab mix (I think there is mayo in it?)
-daikon
-bean sprouts 
-scallions
-carrots 
-spicy Cheetos 
-side of chili mango sauce 

I ordered it to go and ended up mixing it all together in a big bowl at home. It might look like a little but once I dumped it out I was surprised how much there actually was and how filling it was."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Perfect for a quick lunch on a busy work day. Love all the fresh fish and different options. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"MIND BLOWN.  . I love that poke bowls are becoming a trend in Charlotte! 

It's like two sushi rolls exploded in a bowl of deliciousness.  

The staff is really friendly and can explain how the poke bowl creation works. 

I recommend creating your own bowl.  You get to add two proteins for 10.95, 4 toppings, a crunchy topping, and sauce.  

I did a mix of white rice and salad, two servings of spicy tuna, edamame, pineapple, masago, jalapeños, and a side wasabi aioli.  This bowl was incredible.  Everything tasted so fresh. 

I will definitely be back again.  I really want to try the Spicy Cheetos for my topping next time 

I ordered my bowl to go, but the inside was very clean."}
{"text":"Came here on opening day. Feels clean and refreshing, probably because it a new restaurant. The food was okay, nothing special. The price is a bit much. I got a build your own bowl with 2 protein. When it came down to the choices of topping, it was very confusing(limited to 4 toppings). I been to other poke places before and they will tell you what cost extra before you get it but they don't. Other poke places doesn't count the dry topping as a topping but they did. My meal came out to be 15 dollars without a drink. Pretty expensive for a lunch. Also the portion is very small, the bowl is like a kids meal bowl."}
{"text":"Love Seoul! The bowls are amazing! Super fresh ingredients and the staff is super helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"On par with other poke spots in Charlotte. The bowls were fresh and the portions were generous. I want to say this is the priciest of the four poke spots I've tried recently. We both ordered the salmon and tuna with various toppings. Avo was extra; $35 with two drinks."}
{"text":"My bowl was delicious! The staff there is super friendly and inviting.  There is a spam snack that I tried (I can't remember the name of it) but it was delicious too. I was almost full after eating it! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Going into Seoul Poke Bowl, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I had always wanted to try it. It was a little overwhelming at first because there are lots of options and I wanted to make sure I got the right combination of flavors. I ordered a create-your-own bowl and it was very delicious and my mom did the same. What I liked about this is just how different my bowl was from my mom's. Mine was sweet and tangy with mango and eel sauce and hers was more earthy flavors with bean sprouts and cilantro. It was fun, different and delicious! I would also say that I liked it almost a little bit more when I had my leftovers the next day. It allowed the flavors to soak and mix in a little bit more, which gave the dish some nice dimension.

Now do keep in mind, its slightly on the pricey side, as I was kind of expecting for a trendy new restaurant. Because of the price, I won't be going every day or every week but I definitely plan to go back. It was a nice little treat and was a perfect meal on a hot Carolina day."}
{"text":"I am firmly on the Poke Bowl bandwagon. Don't @ me. 

My first true Poke Bowl experience and glad it worked out to try Seoul. We were on the Southside of south end checking out some countertops and came by this up and coming strip center to try it. It was busy but not crowded at lunch. I went with the King Wicked Poke Bowl with tuna, avacado, brown rice and healthy stuff plus crushed crunchy Cheetos on top. The bowl was packed and plenty of food for lunch. Wife got the Soy bowl with Tofu and it was yummy as well. It worked out to be about $30 for the two of us for lunch which isn't cheap but considering the quality it was worth the splurge. Looking forward to more Poke time."}
{"text":"Clean, delicious, fresh, and refreshingly different. 
Spam musubi was tasty AF as was the chicken katsu bowl. Don't skip the lychee lemonade, really good and refreshing. 
Some may think it's high prices but when you think of the quality and the amount of food you're getting it's more then decently priced. Definitely a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this build-your-own poke place, but I was initially disappointed with the quality and value of the bowls. As my boyfriend put it, if the bowls were $8 or $9, they'd be a really sweet deal. But, at minimum $11, the quality just isn't there to justify that price.

I built my own bowl with tuna and shrimp. The salmon was multicolored and the yellowtail looked suspect, which was disappointing because those are two of my favorite raw fishes. The non-meat toppings and sauces were all pretty good, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor of my bowl. The best component of the bowl was the brown rice - it was made really, really well.

I should have expected lower-quality fish and seafood from a fast food poke joint, but I really had my hopes higher. The bowl was very filling, which was nice, but I'm definitely not dying to go back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to a first date during the lunch hour rush.  Food was so delicious I didn't mind the awkward \"meal for first date\" scenario. 

Laid back vibe and cafeteria style. Food quality isn't compromised because of it AND you've an awesome view of the light rail!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait if the line is long. Easy, healthy meal. You cannot customize (substitute or add) to the signature bowls - but you can build your own, so that's what I did. (Seemed like everyone built their own.)

For the build your own option you select 2 or 3 proteins plus 4 complementary toppings.

The bowl was a nice snack size - I do wish it was a bit bigger, wasn't entirely full after!  Went back and got the Miso Soup (which was very good!)

Went around dinner time and luckily a table opened up after I ordered - so be prepared to take your bowl to go if you visit."}
{"text":"Fresh poke with a Korean spin? Yes please! Stopped here while in town visiting and was delighted to see a variety of fresh poke options as well as Hawaiian misubi! The service here was fast and our food was ready to go within minutes. We got two misubis and the Seoul poke bowl which came with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail for the fish options. The bowl also had avocado, mango, and a few other toppings on top of a bed of rice. The poke itself was super flavorful and fresh. The misubi was fresh and the rice was very tender. The drink selection includes yummy options such as lychee lemonade which was super delicious. If you are a poke fan I would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"With Poke suddenly taking over the QC, I am definitely a fan.  Sushi is great, but there is something great about deconstructed sushi!  Seoul offers a unique Korean twist to the standard poke bowl.  I ordered one of their suggested bowls and it was enough food for two meals for a very reasonable price!  And you should give the Spam musubi a try.  Not a fan of spam, but this traditional Hawaiian dish was tasty!"}
{"text":"First experience was underwhelming. They have good options and I may have to try again with something else.

But, first go round...paid $12 for a seaweed wrap that was about 90% rice and 10% other actual stuff. Maybe have to try again..but then again it's a bit expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Some of the freshest fish and great portion sizes. Staff is always so friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect here outside of it being part of the wave of poke places hitting Charlotte. I enjoy the different items that go into poke bowls, so I figured I'd give this neighborhood spot a shot. It's delicious. I'm working my way through the signature bowls and I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to explore this newish-to-Charlotte concept."}
{"text":"This is one of those places, that you wish you could give them a \"6\". The food was off the rails! I've been searching for a quality poke place and looks like we finally found it!

Like many restaurants that serve great food, you have to get there early. We got to Seoul Poke Bowl just a half-hour after they opened on a weekend. Most tables were taken, as you would expect. Seoul Poke Bowl has a wide variety of items from which you can custom make your own bowl, or there are some suggested menu items as well that you can choose. I was impressed that they had so many varieties of fish, including yellowtail. 

Quality of the food was outstanding. You can taste the freshness! Quantity is plentiful, although at first look it seemed it wasn't the case. That is, they use a medium size bowl, but it is packed with food, and even piled high. I talked with one of the guy behind the counter a bit (the owner?) who knew a lot about where they get their fish and how long they've been open, etc. They get the same fish from the same company that sells to the high-end restaurants in the area. They've only been open a few months, too. Prices are about $2 higher than other places I've been, but it is completely worth it. I rather pay a nominal amount more to get fresh food and feel \"full\". So, you will get your money's worth here. You cannot go wrong! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, quality, tasty ingredients. This place has a hip, modern atmosphere plus staff is friendly. In fact, they were very helpful in deciding the best menu items compatible with my diet. They offer nutritious options and they have house-made sauces that are delicious. Bowls will fill you up for a fair price. Interesting Hawaiian Korean fusion with customizable entrees, highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"I love going to this joint. It's quick and you can see all the fresh ingredients in front of you.  I always get the Seoul Poke Special Bowl. There's tons of fish with fresh sides. The homemade drink selection is a hit.The staff is accommodating to special request and very helpful. 

I've read reviews about their prices. It's not cheap but you get fresh quality ingredients and for that, I see value."}
{"text":"We where driving by and turned around because of the appealing storefront.
Wasn't to busy on a pregame Sunday afternoon .
The place is clean and the modern accent is a nice touch
We ordered the spam sushi  and the Seoul poke special
The quality and the ingredients where on point and the service was good as well 
Maybe a little too pricey? And the music a little too loud ?
Other than that I think that I will be back and try few other things"}
{"text":"After our honeymoon in Hawaii, I have been on the hunt for the best poke bowl in Charlotte. This might be it!!!! I went with the build your own bowl with brown rice, spicy tuna, salmon, edamame, masago, green onion, mango, seaweed salad, and wonton strips. My husband got the King Wicked Tuna. We both loved our bowls, as well as the side gyoza that we shared. The items were fresh. The bowls had a great ratio of ingredients. 

My only complaint is that they upcharge everything. Seaweed salad  +$1.50. Two sauces with your bowl +.50. Want to substitute jalapeños for radishes in your signature bowl? They don't do substitutions and told me that I'd have to pay $.50 to switch them. In the end, the meal ended up being more expensive than I anticipated and I believe that a lot of that is due to the various uncharges. That was kinda irritating but the product was so good that I still am giving them all five stars."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I've waited so long for charlotte to finally get a poke joint, and I'm not saying it's not good, but it's not as good as what I've had on the west coast. The place is clean, vibrant, friendly staff and great concept. I just wish the food was better executed for the price. My seaweed wrap had way too much rice and would have held up better with some kind of wax paper wrapped around it instead of placed in a bowl. My husbands bulgogi doesn't even look like it has meat since it's buried under carrots. Overall, if I've never had poke- I'd probably love this place. But I've had some really good poke on the west coast, so unfortunately maybe my bar is set high."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that we finally have a build your own poke bowl restaurant in Charlotte. This place is amazing. The fish options are great - I got tuna and salmon. They don't skimp on the account they give you either. I was a little sad they limit you on number of toppings because there are so many good options. While I wasn't a fan of the upcharge for avocado, that tends to be pretty standard these days. The mango and edamame were great topping choices. I didn't realize the crunchy toppings counted as toppings as well but they let me try the spicy Cheetos without charging me. All of their drinks are very good at well. The passion fruit lemonade and the cucumber Mony water were my favorites. The sauces were very good. Of the ones I tried I liked the wasabi aoli and the citrus ponzu the best. 

The staff was all incredibly friendly and welcoming. I will be coming back here all the time. The food was so good and I was so excited to eat it that I forgot to take a picture!"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com! So good and flavorful. Excellent service. Great environment. I had three proteins and a lot of goodness dumped it. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food and general concept here is good but the nickel and diming on the \"any 4 toppings except for any good toppings like avocado and seaweed salad\" is annoying. I'd prefer they include a small scoop of each by default or do a base bowl and expensive extras lumped together for a single price. When a sprinkling of cilantro is one of the 4 toppings it comes off as super cheap. I found myself struggling to find toppings after paying about $3 more dollars to get the ones I wanted. I also don't like the spice mix they add to the rice at the beginning and couldn't figure it out until I came back-- where is all that offensive garlic/spice taste coming from? They should have explained that. Like I said --I like the food and concept of Poke bars (and this one almost hits the mark) but the menu construction and pricing bugs me."}
{"text":"Seoul is definitely doing something different - you could tell from the moment you walk in and you're greeted with signs for the spam mususbi (google tells me this is very popular in Hawaii) and spicy cheetos topping.

The Lady and I walked in about 30 minutes before closing, but the two guys behind the counter greeted us happily. I wouldn't be as cheerful as them if somebody walked in my front door 30 minutes before my bedtime, so props to them. 

I immediately saw the sign for the Spam Musubi (google it) and ordered it. Spam is something I had in my childhood that I don't have very often, so when I get it, it's kinda special. They made one fresh for me - customer service at it's best! Served piping hot, it was excellent. Brings back good memories.
For my main meal, I got the King Wicked Tuna, and The Lady ordered the Ohana Sake. The flavor profiles were very different, mine was more on the tart side and hers tasted more like sushi rolls. Both were excellent and VERY filling with absolutely quality ingredients. I was surprised when I heard the total, but at about $13/bowl plus the Musubi, it's one of the pricier but definitely quality options. We took our bowls to go and ate it at home and were surprised at just how much food there was. Excellent! We'll of course be back. Why wouldn't we? There's a lot more to try!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good, I think it's a little more pricey than some of the other poke bowl I've been too. The many choices they had was cool. Might have to go back another time and explore the menu a bit. Tuna rocksssssss"}
{"text":"This place is fairly new, very clean and fast. The sole oil Poke special was great!! Huge packed bowl. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love This place! Building your own bowl with their Fresh ingredients is always a pleaser. The lemonade is delicious. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Seoul poke special which was amazing and the King wicked Tuna which I liked but was jealous that she got the better bowl over all. These bowls are huge and we both struggled to finish them.

They also had this Spam rice concoction side sushi thing.
I wasn't in the menu I believe but it was recommended to us by the staff. Thank you for that btw.
I wish I could remember what it was called but honestly I'm pretty sure I could eat that everyday and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"I had been craving something fresh, and this unique take on a create your own bowl or wrap hit the spot! I had the Ohana Sake bowl and enjoyed it. I'm not too familiar with Korean flavors so they are still new and a bit unusual to me, but I look forward to going back and exploring more options. I found it a little pricier than other similar style restaurants, but you get a lot of food (more than it appears). A little too much on trying to upsell other items, but I understand they are pretty new still."}
{"text":"Really addictive quick and easy. Lots of variety and challenging flavor. Love itVery simple process to go through the line pick out your base like rice or whatever and then choose your meat and your toppings you get to customize your bowl. Lots of flavor very fresh staff very friendly. Not much of a negative but the music inside was a little loud and it was hard to hear those that were placing the orders. I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Solid three stars.  Poke is my favorite dish to eat when I'm in Hawaii and I'll sometimes eat it twice a day.  I was pleasantly surprised  to see Seoul and Hi Tide and the rest roll into town.

I stopped by SPB around 6:00pm on a weeknight.  Things were mildly busy with all the tables being taken by the time we left.  Service was friendly, if not somewhat awkward.  The individual scooping the tuna into my bowl apparently scooped too much in the bowl and ended up scooping some out.  I also like my poke bowls somewhat simple (I'm a shoyu guy) and I got a surprising number of remarks from the staff about the lack of toppings in my bowl.

Onto the food.  It was good.  The standout was the spam musubi which apparently is a regular part of the menu now.  The selection of beverages was pretty stellar as well (lillikoi lemonade anyone??).  The poke bowl was okay.  They don't toss your fish in sauce, so it ends up going on top, which is disappointing and the amount of fish was on the light side.  But it was good.

I'll probably be back for the spam musubi and the lemonade, but I'll check out the poke options at our other poke joints (How great is it that we have multiple poke joints??)."}
{"text":"Leaving the gym I seen this place and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. The place is pretty small and all the tables were full but luckily I was getting mine to go. I looked over the menu and there were so many choices between their featured bowls and all the items you can choose for the build your own. I decided to go with the build your own. I was greeted and helped immediately. The station where all the food was looked very clean for 8p and all the food looked very fresh. For $10.95 you can choose a base, two proteins, 4 toppings, dry toppings, and whatever sauce you like. I went for tuna and spicy crab with avocado (which is a premium topping so it's $1.50 more), cucumber, carrots, and onions. Added on some dried nori and eel sauce. Once you mix it all up to get all the favors together in one bite it's so good. Next time I want to try one of their signature bowls!"}
{"text":"Love this place ate there for the first time since I moved here from California. Great price and awesome customer service..

I will be returning"}
{"text":"This is my 4th experience with this restaurant every time is always good! Everyone is super nice and funny I never had a bad experience coming into this restaurant they're really helpful when it comes to trying something new or making suggestions on what I should put on my bowl. My favorite is Ohana Sake bowl."}
{"text":"This review is LONG over due (I went a couple of weeks ago) BUT don't judge me, it was the holidays....

I went to Seoul Poke Bowl for the first time after hearing about them on one of the many CLT food IG pages that I follow(I don't remember the exact one). It looked delicious and I had never had a poke  bowl before so I added this spot to my to-do list. When I got there it was a lot smaller than I'd expected- only about 3 or 4 tables- but *shrugs* I didn't plan on eating there anyway...

I got in line with the intention of creating my own bowl, but I saw a menu of their specialty bowls so I decided to try out their Ohana Sake bowl because it sounded like everything I would've put in my own bowl. The guy that was making my bowl asked if I wanted to try one of the Musubi rolls that they were trying out for the menu and I said sure because, who doesn't love spam, right?  My total was about $18 which was more than I planned on spending but i was in the good spirit of having new experiences so I tried not to cringe TOO hard...

On the way home, I was starving so I tried the musubi and let me tell you....I almost turned the car around to go buy about 5 more and if I wasn't pressed for time (and my waistline) I probably would have. The salt from the spam was balanced with the egg and the rice so it wasn't salty at all. It was warm, beautifully seasoned and only lasted about 3 hungry ass bites.

As for the bowl...

Once I mixed everything up, every ingredient complimented the other beautifully- the raw salmon with the Kim chi, the spicy crab and avocado, the cucumber with the hints of onion, all tied together with the sweet wasabi sauce was pretty much the highlight of my day. I only got through half of the bowl but I finished the second half for dinner and it was even better the second time. 

All in all, I will definitely have to bring my sushi-loving self back Seoul Poke Bowl because they have made me and my stomach very happy. Next time I'll try my hand at creating my own."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Definitely would recommend for a quick bite. The food was fresh and delicious. It is Very clean and the staff is friendly. I am extremely happy we stumbled upon Seoul Poke Bowl!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly customer service. High quality foods. Well crafted poke bowls. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my second poke cafe I tried in Charlotte, and I really loved the service, fresh items and fair price. They also had a kid menu - for $5-6 you can make a bowl with one protein. My daughter loves brown rice+shrimp+corn+avocado bowl with eel sauce :-)"}
{"text":"It's still new but finally stumbled to a poke spot!
We have been waiting for a spot to open up. 
Food is fresh, place is clean and service is great! For the love of poke we'll definitely be back. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I crave Poke bowls from New York and felt so deprived when I came back to Charlotte. I was happy to see that Charlotte finally caught up and have a few Poke places. I tried a couple but Seoul Poke Bowl is by far the best. I work in Midtown so have the advantage to order via DoorDash. My food is always fresh and have never had a bad experience. This is my go to Poke place."}
