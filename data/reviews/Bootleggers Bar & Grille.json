{"text":"Ordered beer on tap, both were flat. Opted for Pepsi. Food was ok. Blind for window in booth we sat in was filthy dirty and food stuck to it.  I'll be sure to go back to Winking Lizard. Always good and no surprises"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while running some errands. We were very hungry and choices were limited. My wife and I were impressed from the moment we walked in. The place is inviting and the staff were appropriately attentive. We had the fried pickles, calamari and Mediterranean wrap. Everything was excellent. While this is out of our way, we will surely find our way back."}
{"text":"Love the back patio. The fountain is so relaxing during happy hour. Food and service is good."}
{"text":"This is our new neighborhood spot. Love the patio with the view of the sunset, pond and golf course, fantastic, but the restuarants a/c is way too cold. Service is efficient,we have tried several of the sandwiches ,salads,nachos and pizza and not a bad item yet.The pizza is definately worth the drive, first bite was good then it just got better:)Good BLOODY Mary's too.Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time I ever tried this place was two years ago, I was really surprised to see the decent draft beer selection and the food tasted good.  If you have any room left after dinner, try the fried pretzel dessert! It has cream cheese stuffed inside, served with vanilla ice cream  and whipped cream on top.....not for the lactose intolerant!   Overall, good place for beers and food."}
{"text":"Well, we waited 15 minutes to see the waitress (only did after returning to the hostess stand).   Order our food (bourbon glazed flat iron and my husband ordered a burger - medium.  The flat iron taste horrible - almost like straight bourbon was pored over the steak. French fries were cold...  land my husband said his burger was more like a meatloaf and was well done.  The beer cheese soup was really good  and hot and our waitress was great once she arrived that is how o can justify 2 stars."}
{"text":"Nice place, food is good- not everything is fresh prepared. Service is good, atmosphere is nice. Would recommend."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for its outdoor deck in the summer and decent food. But helpful hint: if you want to carry on a conversation, don't go on Wednesday night! Music was WAY too loud and service was slow. I usually enjoy trivia night, but the DJ has really amped up the sound. Manager said he would mention it to the DJ, but there was nothing he could do (?)."}
{"text":"At best this is an ok place.  The drink specials are good deal for the price.  You're not getting a $10 drink for $4, but the drink you get is close to the value. The service is adequate.  The perch dinner was daily special.  This should be the thing to get.  The three pieces were not really decent size.  It seemed small for $14.99!  The taste was also on the small size.  Bland and with panko breading, a bad combo.  The fries were fresh cut.  The cole slaw was probably made in house.  It's really closer to two and a half star.  At six thirty, the people came in.  So plan to go before then, if you go.  I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant and bar.   This place really has everything going for it. Its right on a golf course, big bar, great food, and decent prices. The decor is also pretty cool as they kept the whole Mobster/Bootlegger theme all throughout the bar. Pretty neat  We usually get the pizzas and burgers here. They are pretty standard above-average bar food. Tasty but not going to blow your mind. Exactly what you would expect, and filling. You would expect to find a place like this in Medina. Just a great all around stop. They also support local groups by doing fundraiser nights and its really nice of them to host. I hope they do well so visit them! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Toby Keith, I love this bar! Sometimes you really can't put your finger on it, but I love this place. Not pretending to be a upscale wanna be glorious place for food (looking at you Jailhouse) just good food, and service is great. It has a nice atmosphere and the burger was awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome fun. This place is fun.  Clean great recipes and service.    Bar is loaded with TV,s.  Bathrooms are clean.  Fun fun fun.   Love it.   Thanks"}
{"text":"This place used to have good food and good service. Not sure what happened. Our last visit was a disaster. We had my granddaughter with us and she ordered the kids Mac n Cheese. She was served a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese right from the box! What restaurant doesn't make their's homemade?? We had six in our party, 3 dinners came out and we waited for the remaining 3 ... for another 15 minutes! I ordered fish and chips. The fish had soggy breading and fries were cold. Didn't see a waitress for another 15 minutes ... too late to reorder. The final straw was I sent an email on their website. Gave them a month to respond. But haven't heard from them. Obviously, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, fun atmosphere great covered patio good food  and great taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service! We came in with a large group and they were very accommodating! A great place to hang out and cheer on our Cleveland teams. Our waitress Sarah was awesome and was constantly checking on us.   We ordered a lot of appetizers and they were all good. My favorite being the nachos and buffalo chicken dip. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap for dinner and it was sooo good. My favorite part about Bootleggers is the back patio with a pond and water fountain. I can't wait to come back on a summer night and sit outside.   Very cool bar in Columbia Station! If you're in the area definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Very happy! Went here tonight with a big group for a birthday dinner and it was great! We got appetizers and they all came out together, and our meals did as well! Everything was hot and tasted fresh! I got the Ruben which was one of the best ones i have ever had! I also got French onion soup which was homemade!   Very happy with our experience here and will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Bootleggers but this was just the worst. Server never came back to ask if we wanted more beers or refills, while walking by to another table asked if food was ok, and when I shrugged and said I guess, she didn't stop to see what was wrong. Asked for condiments and never got them and had to ask another server. Medium burgers were clearly well done and dried out. 3 tables sat uncleared and dirty on the patio for the 1.25 hours we were here. Server dropped off bill without a word to ask if we wanted anything else. Then never came back to pick it up. We had to take it inside to pay. And to top it off the ceiling is absolutely disgusting on the patio. There were 4 tables on the patio when we ate so it wasn't slammed out there. 2 only had drinks and no food so it's not like she was overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The view from the patio here is everything! Ceiling fans, shade, a pond with fish, and a beautiful manicured golf course. The servers are prompt and friendly. The food is good. The appetizers are really tasty. Grab you family and friends and hang out on the patio with some cold beverages and apps. Also great are their prices! My party of 8 had 4 apps, beers, entrees and one dessert and the total with tip was around $140!!!  The same thing would have cost $300 in a city proper!"}
{"text":"Been to Bootleggers several times and always had a good experience. The restaurant is very nice inside and has a huge outdoor covered patio that overlooks the golf course. The food is very good and I've never had to wait very long. The staff is friendly and knows the menu well. I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"false advertisement, claiming their craft/import drafts are $3.50 a pint...HEADS UP very few are as most are $7.50 (70%) false advertisment. their resaoning....\"it's higher alcohol percent\" bullsh*t... BEWARE they are preying on you being drunk and not noticing.  service is so so just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Service is alright. Food is okay. Desserts are good. Sometimes the servers get side tracked."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice. You have the option for a nice bar or sit down Family restaurant. Calm crowd because it is built off of a golf course. Really nice outdoor patio area that gives off a great view of the golf course. The Beer menu is fantastic! Bootleggers offers an assortment of different craft beers. The menu is pretty big offering many options to choose from. The burgers were very good and the chips and dip is a great side if you don't want fries."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and sat on the deck. Awesome view and very relaxing. We got the chicken Philly and buffalo chicken wrap, both were delicious!! We definitely could have kept eating , but we pretty much licked our plates clean! Friendly staff. Would recommend. Would like to check it out again as a night spot, looks like a cool bar."}
