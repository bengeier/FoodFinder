{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches!!!  Highly recommended.  Great food and great service.  Took a whole U17 boy's basketball team here for dinner between games and they loved it."}
{"text":"Came back for the Gourmet Mushroom burger!  So juicy, just the way I remember and want it.  It is quite amazing how much flavour is packed in this burger"}
{"text":"I love this spot. They make a delicious burger and have an awesome Philly Cheesesteak! I love the hollowed out bun they use for the Philly and the Spicy Cheeseburger is out of this world. Be sure to get your hands on those fries with their special sauce too. Omnomnom

This spot is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood food scene and I recommend you check it out ASAP"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious. The patty was done very well. Although the bun was much bigger than the patty, can use a smaller bun for better balance.

The fries were ok, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I can always appreciate restaurants who put 100% into making a traditional staple a meal that's so high in quality at a budget price. There's nothing gimichy or glamourous about this fast food joint but rest assured you will be rewarded with a burger that tastes way better than it looks. A juicy, inch-thick patty on bioche that's made fresh to order for only $8! Their patty is so uniquely marinated every bite needs to be savoured. Keep up the amazing work and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow,  what great food and service.   The Philly steak is awesome.   The bun it comes in is half of a large bun and stuffed with steak.  The fries are crispy and very good.   
I like sitting alone and enjoying my food and I was able to do this even though every 5 mins people would come in to grab their take out.   I will come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich and a gourmet mushroom burger. Both of them are amazing."}
{"text":"Tried the Gourmet Mushroom Burger and really loved it! The sauce is really unique and ties the flavours in nicely. The bun is nice and soft. Found the burger a little well done for my liking, but it was still juicy. Also ordered a side of fries. I love the sauce they used. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, and staff extremely friendly. Great vibe.  Location in a small dingy plaza, but the food was top notch grub.  Split a cheeseburger and Philly cheese with 1 order fries between two of us. More than enough. Philly was amazing!!  Comes on a French bun, burger was tasty. Fries cooked perfectly with a yogurty sauce on top. Will be going again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Road Grills food truck a while back and we're so excited to see their new Restaurant in our hood called Grill Gate. We tried the mushroom cheeseburger and Philly cheesesteak for dinner and can I say, this meal was an 11/10. The burger was huge, perfectly cooked and had so much flavour, and to top this amazingness off was next level garlic tzaziki which made my tastebuds go wild!! The Philly cheesesteak was packed into a big 1/2 crescent delicious bread. Steak was cooked perfectly and the juicies all melted into the bread which was SOO GOOD!!!! The service was also exceptional, they were so friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back for more, so happy Grill Gate is open!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was delicious.

I would say more \"Tehran\" than philly as i over heard the owners mentioning that they are from Iran and i could taste the Persian influence on this take of the traditional philly cheesesteak. However I should have got it with the fries as I had scarfed thru the sandwich really really fast. Was leaving the place a bit hungry.

As meaty as it is- it did not fill me up. As I was leaving and went to counter to grab some napkins. The owner remarked that he has an extra cheeseburger and if any one would like it- I instantly volunteered for this task.

How in a second I went from craving more food to having more food than I need is the magic of luck and fortune. The burger was marvelous. I could feel the butter from the amazing bun. I could tell the beef patties were made in house because once again that Persian kebab flavor changed the taste of the meat completely compared to generic burgers. I will go back there to try the spicy cheeseburger.

Good stuff- and the sauce on the fries looked amazing. I need to try those too."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. If Yelp had a 6 star option to allow for beyond-5-star-establishments, I'd dedicate mine to this one! For the student special, my sister and I shared the cheeseburger with their fries for $11.30 with tax. It came on a cutting board with a knife and two forks. They freshly cooked the beef patty and fried the fries, which you can be confident about because the meal was hot when they brought it out... and we heard some sizzling!

The burger had a fluffy brioche bun and held the delicious 8oz patty which was a good size to share. The cashier was kind enough to allow us to try the mushrooms with the student discount which woule have otherwise been an extra $2. The sliced mushrooms added more texture to the burger along with their special sauce. As I've read, their sauce is yogurt based and it's light and creamy unlike the thicker sauces that are mayo based.

What's so special about Grill Gate is that they don't compromise quality even though they are essentially selling fast food (burgers, fries, etc.). They grill everything on the spot, take the time for presentation when you're dining in, and their customer service is solid. I think larger corporate establishments that sell burgers for $15+ should take notes from Grill Gate to improve on the taste and portion of their burgers and fries.

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is you need to go here now. Like stop what you are doing and go. Best burgers in Toronto.

We got the Philly steak sandwich, Gourmet Mushroom Cheezburger and the Crispy coated fries. They were cooked to perfection and had so many amazing flavours. The bread for the Philly steak sandwich was perfectly toasted and it was a unique take to the philly cheese steak. I personally liked the Gourmet Mushroom Cheezburger more than the Philly steak sandwich. The Gourmet Mushroom Cheezburger was oozing with its special sauce and the entire combination of the burger with mushrooms and cheese just hit the spot. The fries were very crispy and the ranch sauce was really addicting. 

Please do yourself a favour and come to this place."}
{"text":"My first time at this place. Greeted as soon I walked in and a the guy behind the counter began to explain the options. I went in planning to buy a cheeseburger but the way he was explaining the Philly Cheese Steak I had to get it and made it a combo. Usually I don't get combos at other places cause I don't want to eat the fries. But here when I was reading other reviews on Yelp and looking at the pictures the fries looked really good and to make a fair assessment I wanted the full experience and I did not take this to go. As I wanted to eat the fries and Philly steak fresh and hot. And let me tell you...listening....the Philly Cheese Steak and fries were awesome! Eating it with some Latin music playing in the background and looking out the doors on a warm Monday afternoon (Apr 30)...I felt I was in some other Latin country....amazing how a good food can transport you. For $15 bucks it's an amazing experience. Def going back again...after I work out all the calories I just ate."}
{"text":"Finally Road Grill got a restaurant and it's called Grill gate. I think I may have reviewed Road Grill on my Yelp page before.
  The best burgers ever are made here. My man and I are always trying to go to the Road grill truck for the delicious burgers but we kept missing it. So when I saw that they were opening an actual restaurant as well as keeping their truck, I had to tell my boyfriend!
 We finally got the chance to visit Grill gate tonight and we were greeted by the owner Sia
( I hope I'm spelling his name right). He is such a friendly great guy and you can tell he puts his heart into his food. You guys need to try their burgers I've had their steak sandwich before 2 but hands down their burgers are the best they also have this amazing mint sauce they put on the french fries and in their burgers.
 I love the way the food tastes it's like I'm getting a homemade burger and I can't describe it better than to say just amazing delicious well worth the money you get so much for what you're paying for and again the friendliness of Sia and the staff is just great.
 I'm always telling people about Road Grill and now I get to tell them about Grill gate too.
  If you're ever in Sheppard Avenue West area due to check out this place trust me on that none of these chain restaurants go anywhere near the greatness of the burgers here. I'll definitely be back again and bring some friends with me"}
{"text":"We were on a road trip traveling from Bruce Peninsula to Niagara Falls. The reviews for this place were so good that we went an hour of the way to try it. The reviews just don't do the food justice. It is a tiny little place but they produce some of the simplest, most flavorful food I've ever eaten. The Philly Steak sandwich is outrageous and my wife's burger was among the best 2 or 3 I've ever tasted. The saddest part about this whole story is that we live in the states and can't make a quick trip for dinner. Congratulations to the owners, who are fantastic, you've got an absolute winner on your hands."}
{"text":"Was a regular at their food truck previous years and I'm happy to say that the brick and mortar shares the same great taste.

It's very convenient to be able to indulge after lunch hours and at such a close proximity to their normal lunch location.

It's consistently been one of the best burgers I've had; above all fast food chains and above most gourmet burgers as well.

I wasn't a fan of their food truck service some days but the restaurant service gets a 5/5.

If in the area and if you love a good burger you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

The fries are really good too and I was told the philly cheese steak was done well too.

Check em out"}
{"text":"They've got one of the best burgers I've ever tried. Went there 15m before they close but they stay opened until 9:15-9:30 for us to finish our food. The owner was super nice. Make sure to try their burger and special fries."}
{"text":"Amazing Service. Amazing Food. Amazing Price.

We went as a group of 8 after Archers Arena (5min away). The food did not disappoint. Everyone loved the burgers and the fries (their sauce is amazing!).

Bottom Line: Unassuming little restaurant from the outside with gourmet burgers that will take your taste buds into euphoria!"}
{"text":"Very good steak sandwich for the price. $15.25 including tax for a combo with fries, special sauce, and a drink. The fries were a bit of a letdown, crispy but unsalted and the sauce was nothing worth mentioning but the sandwich is why I came and why I will be returning. Very friendly service too"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and even better food. Best burger in the city HANDS DOWN! Went once and have been counting the days until I can go again. That again, is tonight and I am psyched!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians have 2 options. Food is very tasty! 
Their fries and the sauce is great!
We loved the quesadillas better than the sandwich. 
If you're around this place,  definitely give it a try!
The staff is very warm and welcoming"}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect given that the plaza in which this place is located is not the most inviting or appealing. However, I trust Yelp reviews and I was very impressed with the food here and will no doubt return. The Philly cheese steak sandwich is mouth wateringly delicious. great flavour with the marinated ribeye and sauteed mushrooms. This is not your traditional philly cheese steak, any purist from Philadelphia would probably shake their heads but nevertheless it is very delicious. Instead of cheese we have a garlicy yogurt sauce which is very hearty and luxurious. The bread is substantial with great texture soft on the inside with a tasty sesame and herb crust. The fries are topped with a yogurt based sauce with dried mint which is a very middle eastern taste profile and works surprisingly well in this context! The service was fast, the layout clean, clear, and simple. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite fast food store in North York. Their stake sandwich is one of the best!
Fries with yogurt sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat in the downsview area.

You gotta try the:
*Philly cheese steak sandwich - lived up to the hype!
*Gourment Mushroom burger- i love love LOVE those crunchy onion bits under the burger patty.

If you're not getting the philly steak sandwich get the philly steak fries.

Don't judge Grill Gate based on the appearance of their neighbours. It's a nice place to swing by and grab some good grub after a long shift. You know when you eat something so good you can't stop smiling and nodding?! Yup that's what grill gate will do to you. The staff was super friendly. And for my lazy friends - you can order them on skip the dishes.

See you there!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious . But what made it even better was the owners put their heart into making the food delicious and were so kind! I wish them the best in their family business. The taste of the meat for the burger was delish, the bread so fresh and the fries were perfect!"}
{"text":"You know when you find something great, something amazing, that feeling of excitement that makes you want to tell everyone you know about it. Well......that happened here. 

The staff was so welcoming and polite it was like chilling with friends you haven't seen in a long time. 

The food was next level. I have to be honest and say I've never had a steak sandwich that was so perfectly prepared. It was juicey, succulent, and the taste just popped off and punched you in the face. I did have trouble moving around after that one, but it was so worth it. The fries (coated and drizzled in the house special sauce) were a huge new take and experience on fries. The were right to say you'll never want to eat fries with ketchup again. It was a beautiful sauce with a mint hint that was very gentle yet incredibly tasty. 

Can't wait to try something else off the menu as I'm sure that it's gonna be a new adventure. 

Well done to the people of grill gate, keep shinning!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in north York! There's nothing to really complain about - this spot is super cute and the staff is super friendly, no wonder they are rated 5 stars. Definitely try this place out if you're ever in the area.. I'd say it's worth the travels as well. Will be back to try some other items they offer but definitely coming back for the burgers and fries!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I'm so glad this place opened up near where I live. My husband and I went on a Monday evening and it was busy, but we got amazing service and incredible food. You have to try this spot! 

We ordered the mushroom cheeseburger and the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, as well as a side of crispy fries. Everything was so good. The meat on the Philly cheesesteak was so juicy, it dripped into the bun sesame bun perfectly and has a delicious middle eastern sauce in it (like tzaziki. The burger was also delicious, perfectly cooked. And the fries were crispy....like Costco fries! All incredible. Oh and the prices were cheap! $9 for each item (fries were $3.50 with a combo).

I'll definitely make this spot a regular visit."}
{"text":"This new place is just terrific
I had the Phillie cheese and fries with their excellent sauce. 
The people their are as polite as could be
I would recommend this place to everyone

One of the best meals I've had !!!

Worth the visit that's for sure. 

:)"}
{"text":"Bought the following:

Gourmet cheese burger, $7.99.
Mushroom burger, $9.99.
Philly cheese steak, $9.50.

Make it a combo: 
with salad or fries and drink, $3.99 each.

Classic poutine, $7.99.

All burgers/sandwich were gourmet-good.
Fries were ok but not crispy as advertised.

Caesar salad & coleslaw were ok; I can eat the burgers without these salads.

Place was clean.
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We know this great owner since he had A road Grill food truck and the line up was so long 
We are very happy that now its easy to find him 
Siavash is a real gentleman very respectful and another man who is working with him is also so sweet 
The food has no definition to talk about until you try it.
Just try it and get addicted 
Try my favorite philly cheese steak
You can fly with it
Good luck to siavash , and Grill Gate
Sky is the limit"}
{"text":"The food is good there and add $3.99 you can upgrade your burger to combo with fries/ salad and drink. The food portion there is quite big so we can't finish all of them. Their poutine is also good. Highly recommend! Still full now!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the area. Parking if your handicapped is not great in the area. I ordered a hamburger only and it was $9.00 I find it quite expensive for this area. The people inside were nice and the way the burgers was presented on the table was nice. The burger was very good, better than most in the area. The owner offered me a few fries for free
Would I come back Yes but not often, due to pricing. Would I recommend you to come, Sure."}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had it Toronto.  Been here a year and this little family run business is the best.  They want to make it good for you.  Definitely a 5 stars"}
{"text":"I have never seen such consistent reviews for any restaurants on Yelp! Grill Gate is one of the few burger places I had bookmarked but was never in the area to try, and I wouldn't really go out of my way just to have burgers.

We were not too close to Grill Gate, but still decided to drop by for a quick, simple meal in the middle of the day. 

Small plaza where parking can be a problem. We came at an odd time, around 4:30pm. About 3 parking spots were available.

The restaurant has a decent selection of burgers, wraps, sandwiches, burritos, and sides written on the blackboard. Appreciate that they list the main ingredients underneath, so it made my decision a lot easier! I'm a sucker for spicy food, so I got the Spicy Cheezeburger. Food was brought to us on a cutting board in about 10 minutes. Simple, clean layout. The burger looked like a regular burger on an advertisement - tall, solid, and pretty. 

First bite into it and I already knew this was the one, the one burger that I have been looking for my entire life. The perfect amount of juice, cheese, and spiciness. Its thick patty complements the slightly crispy edged buns. Every bite was heavenly. This wholesome goodness was made from ingredients anyone can get from a grocery store, none of that fancy big named ingredients that you see at a nice restaurant; yet Grill Gate nailed it. 

The crispy coated fries were also delicious. Instead of ketchup, I was happy with the white minty sauce drizzled on top.

I would drive 40 minutes just to come here for their burgers."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing!! It honestly has the best philly cheesesteak I have ever had, and I have had a lot of philly cheesesteaks! Plus their service is amazing (nicest people ever). 
I am so happy that I finally found some good food near my home. This is definitely going to be my new spot.

I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"New place just opened up I stopped by to give it a shot and I'm glad I did! I got the Spicy Cheeseburger combo meal and the burger was juicy, the bun was nice and crispy, and the spicy sauce gave it that extra kick! The fries were smothered with their homemade sauce that gave it a unique and bold taste! I highly recommend you give this place a shot! The burgers are huge you definitely get your money's worth! The owners are lovely people and made sure I was 100% satisfied with my meal and I'll be returning again!"}
{"text":"Don't let this small store in this neighbourhood fool you. These cheezburgers and philly cheese steaks are delicious. The flavours blew me away. A must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I can say that this place deserves its 5 star rating!! 

The first time I went, we ate in the restaurant. We ordered the cheeseburger and the philly cheese steak sandwich, we also both had combos. The gentlemen at the front counter who might also be the owners were very courteous and you can tell they love what they do and care about what their customers think. 

We were so surprised when our food came, it was presented so beautifully on a wooden cutting board. The burger, sandwich and  fries that came with the meals were all sizable portions. This is a great burger, you really can't compare it to any fast food or even restaurant frozen burger. The beef is so fresh as are the toppings, the bun is soft and pillowy, everything about this burger is delicious. The philly steak sandwich was equally as delicious, a half of a large baguette bun stuffed to the top with steak, cheese and mushrooms, it was flavourful and, again, so fresh. The fries, yes they are breaded \"Costco\" fries as some have said, I actually am a fan of those fries, and if you don't like Costco fries then just come for a burger, it's still worth it! The second time I came here I tried the beef kabob wrap, this again was delicious, topped with cheese and eggplant, I loved the unique flavoring and the wrap itself was a nice chewy tortilla but it was closer almost to a naan bread, it was grilled perfectly and I really enjoyed it. 

The restaurant is very casual, you order at the back and they bring your food out to you. It's clean and nice on the inside, despite the plaza outside which is a bit run down, give this place a chance, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Great people running it. 100% recommended  spicy cheeseburger was delicious"}
{"text":"Drove 30 to 40 mins to try this place to see if it was really a 5 star burger I would give it a 4 max. The service was really good the philly was same 4 star and the chicken burger same."}
{"text":"A great and affordable burger place in North York? That's unheard of! Majority of the well known burger joints are located downtown and so when I heard about this place opening outside of Sheppard West station, it was a surprise. On top of that, the ratings of this place made me really curious to see its 5 star worthiness. Greeted right when we went in, my sister and I opted for the student special (crispy coated fries with a drink plus a gourmet cheezeburger for 3.49 extra) with a mushroom cheezeburger (he didn't charge us extra for it). The burger and fries came beautifully on a cutting board, presentation was beyond my expectations from a burger place. The fries were amazing, they tasted similar to Cosco fries and the special sauce was unique & delicious! The cheeseburger was really fresh, the patty was well cooked & the mushrooms complemented it. It was also less messy to eat as well. To add, service was top notch. 

All in all, I'm glad this place opened and I can't wait to come back!!!! You should definitely check it out, it'll be worth your buck as it's cheaper than many burger places & it comes with awesome service!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Philly sandwich and the signiture fries. Highly recommended. One of the best Philly Ive ever had. well cooked and seasoned. clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers and fries! The fries were so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Special sauce was tasty. The cheese burger was gooey with cheese and loaded with good flavoured meat. 

The only negative was the poutine. It was soggy and the gravy is mediocre and not enough cheese. Sogginess was possibly due to the fact that we did take out but still not amazing tasting either."}
{"text":"Come here for the burgers and amazing steak sandwich! The fries are also great, and the owners are very nice and helpful if you're a first timer. Looking forward to trying to the spicy burger next time!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this restaurant on the way home and I  was amazed with the food.

I ordered the spicy cheese burger (around 10 dollars) and made it into a combo (2.99).  The burger was really good, had a mix of cheeses, house sauce and a grilled jalapeño;it was delicious! The fries were crispy and soft on the inside; came with their home sauce. It was better than Mcdonalds fries! I finished with a bottle of water :).  

I will come back again to try their other menu options.  You can tell that a lot of love and effort goes towards their burgers."}
{"text":"I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  What a unique take on a classic.  I know what y'all thinking... It looks bomb, but who's to say it taste good?  Lemme assure you... It taste good... its bomb...

Gourmet Mushroom burger was really good and juicey.  But get the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  It's bomb. 

Fries were not bad.  The sauce was good.  Problem with good sauce is that there's never enough.    

Drink selection was slim... though you do have the choice between Pepsi or Coke!

Owner was a standup dude.  He seemed genuine when coming out to make sure our meals were on point, and even made sure to personally take care of the trays or...um..  cutting boards when we were ready to go.

Oh... and the philly sandwich?  Bomb-"}
