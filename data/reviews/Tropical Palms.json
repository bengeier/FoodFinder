{"text":"As of April 2012, it's not at 684 Yongle--it's at 225 Church St., just south of Dundas St. East.  Had a really nice Jerk chicken with rice & beans and salad there for CAD 10."}
{"text":"This place used to have a lunch special for $5.09 including taxes! (that's right, including taxes!)  Now it's 6.50 including taxes, which is still a good deal.    It includes a chicken leg (Fried, jerk, bbq, stew, curry), coleslaw, rice and a pop!  The women there are also very nice to talk to.    The only downside is that they have no a/c, so in the summer, it gets really hot, but it's definitely one of the better deals downtown."}
{"text":"Went here one night when I stayed in Toronto for the Toronto Reggae Fest. I honestly thought the food was not all that. The rice was tasteless, the \"jerk chicken\" was basically roast chicken which was okay,b ut no taste of jerk seasoning at all. The woman taking our order was extremely RUDE. Someone else eventually stepped in and completed our order. I live in New York where you can get TONS of great carribean food,  I expected this to be very good because I know Toronto has a strong Carribean presence. Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"So far, I've only been once and I'll go back. The lunch specials are only $5.10 and you get a good size portion pf tasty food. Lunch specials include jerk chicken, curry chicken, goat and I'm not sure what else, all served with rice or rice and beans and cole slaw. I tried the jerk chicken with rice and beans and cole slaw. Everything tasted good and fresh, and really, $5.10 is a bargain!  They also were serving rotis. The guy in front of me ordered a jerk chicken roti which sounded delicious. I'll be back either for that or the curry chicken.  It's a pretty small place, but they do have seating for between 10-20 people. Most people were ordering take-out. Lots of standard soft drink options and some Caribbean favorites."}
{"text":"I may just be partial to Caribbean food, but this place is fantastic.  It's a great sit down Jamaican restaurant that serves food that seems less greasy/oily than the stuff you might get at the Ritz, for instance, without compromising on taste.  The restaurant (actually located at Church and Dundas) is colorful and vibrant and a good spot to actually sit down and enjoy your meal.  Definite recommend!"}
