{"text":"Premium Burger is a great spot for a burger in the food court at Paradise Valley Mall.  We go in once a week and have never been disappointed.  Every burger that we have tried has been juicy and delicious including the chicken burger. They have a very good sauce too.  Service is friendly and as fast as it takes to make a fresh burger and fries. If you are in the mall or near the mall,stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"The best hamburger very good quality very clean the owner very friendly is given you the best service  I definitely recommend. If you are in the Paradise valley mall this is the place you want to eat"}
{"text":"Great service, made to order, fresh ingredients, and great flavor. I highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Went to the mall today and saw this place opened. It was a very clean place to eat and the burgers tasted so fresh. The prices are very reasonable and the owner is fantastic! The employee was also very accommodating! Will continue to come back"}
{"text":"I have very good burger that is comparable to in and out. They are new so they were still working out the kinks but I'm sure given time, they will rise to the occasion. Our burgers were juicy and the mushroom with Swiss cheese was tasty.  Although there could've been more mushroom and less onion. The menu is limited but I'm sure that is due to the fact that they want to get everything right before expanding. Give them a try The next time you're in the mall. I'm sure you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I tried this place the first day opened it was really good the owner Works behind the counter he's really friendly they don't have much of a large option or variety mostly just burgers but overall I had a good experience if you're ever in the mall I suggest you try this out"}
{"text":"Premium Burger.  With a name like that, it had better be good.  I had the Caramelized Onion Burger and it WAS good.  However, it could be \"premium\" if it were made to order vs. pre-made, then warmed.  In fairness, it's located within the mall food court where diners expect a quick turnaround, but I prefer it fresh.  The French Fries were hot, crispy and salted to perfection.  While the service was fast and friendly, I would recommend a little attention to \"quality control\".  Drink refills are free, but both the original pour and refill settled to about 1/2 the cup.  Filling after the foam settles would be appreciated."}
{"text":"I was looking for a decent burger that wasn't In & Out and was nearby and found this place on yelp. Packed everyone up and headed over to PV mall on this slow Friday evening.  They made my burger to order and the food was delicious. For an amazing burger & fry deal you can't find a better burger. I even appreciated it more than Habit."}
{"text":"I have to say that they have the BEST burgers! We had the cheeseburger with caramelized onions and fries... so good and so fresh. The gal working at the counter and grill was so friendly and helpful with suggestions for our order. It's a local eatery and we will definitely be back very soon. Thank you for the great food."}
{"text":"Good burger....comparable to in-n-out; fresh meat & veggies although I do prefer the bun of premium!!! It's made to order so if your looking for something not of fast food but also not trying to hurt your budget id recommend this place ! I ordered the #1 premium burger small-7.60$"}
{"text":"Just finished the caramelized onion burger and I am impressed. PV mall has a fantastic burger place that it really needed. I'm so glad I ate here and I will be coming back. Also, the people running the shop were so nice. Overall a great experience."}
