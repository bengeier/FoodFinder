{"text":"My wife and I went to Gianna Via's on 1/13/13 for a date night.  We were seated with no wait and drinks/menus were brought promptly.  We ordered the garlic bread pizza for an appetizer and I was pleasantly surprised at how big the portion was.  We actually only ate half and took the rest home.  I ordered the prime rib salad and my wife ordered the chicken marsala.  I also ordered a large yeungling draft, but the waitress was nice enough to point out that they were running a special on another size, which saved us some money on the bill.  

The food came and we were not disappointed.  The salad was large and had quality greens, no iceberg lettuce.  The meat was also good, as were the dressing and other toppings.  My wife's marsala was not a huge portion, but it tasted great and was very filling.

The experience was great until it came time for the bill.  We had been finished eating for approximately 30 minutes and our waitress had not returned.  She had been given a large table and was preoccupied with taking care of them.  After another 15 minutes, I went to the bar to ask for takeout boxes and went to the hostess table to get our bill.  They had to track down our waitress so that we could pay (I think the owner had to track her down).  We were able to then pay, but nobody really apologized for the wait or offered anything in return.

Overall the restaurant is a great value and a nice atmosphere with great quality food.  I was just disappointed in how long it took to get our bill and pay.  We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Italian Oven Restaurant on Grove Road is delicious. I am a sucker for Italian food and this restaurant hits the spot. The dessert is also delicious. I've always had wonderful servers too."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, it is healthy food in a clean environment that is about to get even better with a new bar.  The staff is great and so is the food.  I like the Panini's and the home made chips. Italian Sausage, Classic Italian, Parmesian Crusted Chicken, Tuscan Chicken, Meatball, they are all great. The wedding soup is also a favorite.  I frequent this place often, probably too much, but I love it!"}
{"text":"Italian Oven now called Gianna Via's. Only difference is a full service bar. Had no drinks, but the specials sounded reasonable.

Had the Lamb Ragu. Sort of a cross between Italian & Greek. Very good. Came with soup or salad. Had the Broccoli Cheese soup. Good but nothing special.

The bar has boosted business a great deal. Usually you could walk right in & get a table immediately. Had a slight wait last night. Don't understand why people wait over an hour for a table at Armstrong's when this place is at the other end of Caste Village."}
{"text":"My boyfriend treated me and my mom for breakfast here today before we went to look at houses. My omelet was fluffy and overloaded with cheese, in a delicious way that is. I liked the hash browns that came with my omelet as they were shredded the way I like them. I couldn't finish my hash browns since my omelet was so big! The service was good and the decor was nice and clean. I hope they stay in business. They deserve it. 

My only little complaint is that they didn't have sugar-free jelly for my toast. But our waitress tried to look for some anyway. No big deal."}
{"text":"Never been in before name change. Interior is beautiful. Dark wood and stone. Very warm & inviting. Bottled domestics 3 bucks with a daily special of $2. Well wine at $5 per glass for a generous pour. Apps ordered were coconut shrimp & fried zucchini. Both were tasty with more interesting dipping sauces than the usual. Plated attractively & with a nod to more upscale dining. Hub had lasagna stacks and thought it just okay. But he was expecting cheesy greasy. It was a modern take & I thought it lighter and tasty. His side salad was delicious with roasted red peppers & chickpeas. A cut above the ordinary. I ordered quatro formaggi pizza which had goat cheese & pistachios. We both loved it & he was jealous lol. Bill was a very modest 57 bucks after several drinks, apps & meals. We def will go back. Service was perfect but it wasn't crowded as we there late afternoon. Bathrooms needed a little help - a liitle untidy & auto towel dispenser broken.  Otherwise a great surprise dining experience in Caste Village."}
{"text":"We were in Caste Village today and saw the new sign; it is definitely called Gianna Via now, but as I said before, the ownership has not changed. For some reason, Yelp won't recognize the name change."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since the first Italian Oven opened and they were showing up all over the area with the black and white tiled floors.  They were inexpensive, popular and had decent food.   But then there were problems and they closed.  

Not sure if this Italian Oven is owned by the same family but the decor is nicer than the IOR's of the past.  Walk in and there is a desert display and the deserts look delicious.  Was immediately seated and our waitress was great.  Refills without asking or even noticing, stopped and asked at the correct time without interrupting our conversation.  There is wine available but did not sample.  Did not notice if IOR serves beer but would think with wine there must be beer available

Was not real hungry and tried a little pizza that is cooked in a brick oven.  The crust is thin and crisp like most brick oven pizza, the sauce is sweet so it should be a big seller in these parts since Fiori's is similar and popular.  Was not real hungry and the pizza filled me up so did not get a chance to try the deserts.  They menu has pasta, salads and panini's.  The pasta dishes looked to be popular, at many tables surrounding us."}
{"text":"Another good spot for pizza, sandwiches and basic Italian food.  There pizza is one of the best in the 'Burgh.  Just about every meal we've had has been very good.  They run specials every day of the week and some monthly.  If you're looking for good Italian food in a casual atmosphere that won't break your wallet this is the place."}
