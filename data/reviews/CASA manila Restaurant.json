{"text":"The food is generally pretty good. The service can be a hit or miss. A little bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago me and my wife came here to eat for dinner. We waited for a while to be seated, which was fine cuz it looked like there was a private party. So when finally a waitress took us to our table, their head waiter all of a sudden yelled at the waitress, scolding her. And then he came towards us and rudely asked us to stand and wait again at the door. We were so humiliated we just left and vowed not to come back ever again."}
{"text":"Went for witerlicious with a bunch of cowoekrs.  We waited 30 minute before we were even served anything. The our main course came an hour later. Most our food was cold. Also most of us got stomach problems. Lychee ice cream was good tho...2 stars for lychee ice cream"}
{"text":"Group of friends went there for an early dinner get together. We order the kamayan style set-up. It has the rice, adobo, kare-kare and atchara. And on the side, we ordered lechon. It was very good. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try on my most recent business trip to Toronto, since it seemed like a good break from the chain restaurants in the area. Wow, was I ever wrong! After taking our drink orders, we waited nearly 30 minutes but the waitress never came back with our drinks or to take our food order. We finally went inside (we were sitting on the patio) to find a server, and someone else came out to take our order. When the drinks and food finally arrived nearly a half hour later, they got two of our orders wrong, and forgot to bring a plate or cutlery. We had to go back inside to find the waitress when we wanted to leave, since we'd been sitting for a good 20 minutes after having finished our food (which was bland and rather unappetizing, to tell the truth) and nobody came by. It took the waitress three tries to prepare the bills correctly, and she kept asking for more time. I've never seen such awful service. After we finally complained, one of the other servers came out afterwards to apologize for the two \"new\" servers, but after waiting nearly two hours and spending twice as much as necessary on mediocre food, I'd already decided never to go back."}
{"text":"Tried Kamayan with my family and it was an \"A-OK\" experience. Different from my 1st dine-in experience, I'm giving this place a 3-star rating for the following reasons:

* Service was pretty slow - Food wasn't served until about 1 hr after our reservations; Servers were too busy with other tables to mind our big group

* Food quality/taste was decent but the quantity of certain items (i.e., Kare Kare) served for Kamayan was too little for the price charged per person ($26)

* Desserts were not at the same quality as the individually-priced desserts - you can tell they \"cheaped\" out on the portions by not putting as much of the key ingredients (i.e., buko pandan didn't have enough jelly and coconut -- 90% liquid)

Overall, Kamayan was a nice experience to share with family but not something I would do again. It's over-priced."}
{"text":"A complete disappointment and very sad kamayan. As per the instructions online, patrons are required to provide advance notice of preferred set menu with kamayan to prepare the food.  I've selected Premium - set B for $39.95/person.  Casa Manila failed to deliver what had been promised in the menu.   The milkfish was replaced with battered pieces of fish and tiny pieces of squid, not as per advertised in the photo.  Quality and volume as presented on website is not representative of you will really get. Refer to attached photo."}
{"text":"Asked for hot water and the cup was very dirty filled with dust and hair. Ordered chicken vermicelli and there was barely any chicken in it. Would not come again."}
{"text":"We have lunch at this Filipino restaurant on a lazy Sunday. It was our first time and we really enjoyed the experience.

We stepped into a semi-\"survivor\" themed decor with traditional pieces placed throughout restaurant. The menu were clean, modern and explained dishes well for us, non-Filipino folks. The waiters and owner were very attentive to our needs. 

We tried the Spanish paella, as it caught our eye. But definitely a lot of very tasty looking dishes on the menu to try in the future.

After what seemed like a long wait, we got our Paella. It was a healthy portion for 2 people, with plenty of calamari, shrimp, chicken and mussels. There was mention of sausage on the menu, that was no where to be seen in the dish itself. But, all in all, with a touch of Srachacha, the dish was very nice. 

For desert, we decided to try the buko pandan. Once again, the portion was definitely something to share. The crushed ice in this dessert was initially unappealing, but we soon started to enjoy the crunch of the ice in this delicious coconut concoction.

Definitely a place we will be returning to, with a larger group to try more of the dishes here!"}
{"text":"We went there last Sunday during buffet time and the food had too much MSG. My throat became very dry even though I had soup. The leche flans were dry too when they're supposed to have syrup on them. Most of the food were cold as they were put on display without something to keep them warm. We only ate so little and left as the food were so unsatisfying. What a huge waste of money."}
{"text":"I went to Casa Manila with a business colleague who has never had Filipino food. The staff was welcoming and knowledgeable. Being Filipino, I wanted him to try everything so we ordered a variety of dishes. Everything was delicious, fresh. The portions were just right and we had enough left overs to pack a lunch the next day. Of course we ended the meal with Halo-Halo. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the host recommended the buffet since it was my first time there.  The buffet is $6.95 with a main, rice and egg soup and each incremental main is a dollar each. 
I tried the Kare-Kare (beef  in peanut sauce) which was....good but I feel as though it was sitting there for awhile so it didn't taste very fresh and just wasn't hot enough.  The beef was also tough and chewy.  The egg soup wasn't hot either, it was warm edging on the cool side.  I opted for an additional side which I forget what it was but was a tomato based beef stew which was another disappointment.  The beef was also tough. 
I also tried the BBQ Pork skewer (off the menu, not part of the buffet).  While the sauce on it was delicious the pork itself was tough.

I'd steer clear of the buffet and if anything would recommend ordering off the menu. 

I was disappointed given the high ratings on this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Being Filipino myself it's nice to see a proper Filipino restaurant complete with big plates, a spoon and fork and a large bowl of rice to share! Will definitely be back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love the food, very tasty! place is very clean, only drawback is it takes an hour to get your food ready.  So you will starve by the time you get your meal."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Not great. But the wait is horrendous. Once, I waited for close to two hours for a take out! So, I didn't go back for awhile. My husband wanted to give this place another try. I think we learned from our mistakes once for all!  The food came close to an hour after I called in for the order. Their excuse for the delay... 'We were busy. You were not the only customer'. WTF! Definitely don't go there unless you have hours to waste."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Will not return.  

Showed up on a Saturday afternoon, waited for at least 5 min to be seated in a half empty restaurant. Not a big deal.  Was ignored for another 15 minutes before we got up and left. Not one of the 4-5 servers in this tiny restaurant stopped to ask if we wanted drinks or to place our order.   Terrible service. Do not waste your time. We went to the Mexican Amigos next door, had great service and food."}
{"text":"My bf does not like filipino food. I don't really know how to cook Filipino food but when I do follow the occasional recipe he enjoys it. Other than that he thinks that the food from the restaurants or family parties are just inedible. Harsh I know...

So after a recommendation from someone we went to Casa Manila over the weekend with 2 other people. We had 2 vouchers ($15 for $30) that we wanted to use. 

The food was light and decent. A bit bland. When we asked for medium spice we got barely there spice. And that is saying a lot since my tolerance for spicy food is quite low. The prices were a tiny bit high for the quality/quantity of food. They were charging downtown TO prices when one can go to a fantastic thai restaurant with a lower price point in downtown TO. I don't mind paying more for food but it has to be AMAZING.  I would give the food a 6.5-7/10. I think that the presentation could use more work and there should more flavour. Keep the lightness but add more punch to the flavour. The shrimp paste was good though. My bf said that the best part of the meal was the Sarsi :-) I really liked the sizzling bangus sisig. The vegetarian spring rolls were nice and hot but you can barely taste the jicama and sweet potato. I think that little adjustments would make the food great and bring in a more diverse crowd.

The servers were friendly but a bit disorganized. I think it is because the servers were not really in charge of their own sections. Instead of having one designated server for your table you have 4 different people. It felt like as if the servers themselves were confused. I like the homey feel but it would be nice if the service was a bit more professional.

When it was time to pay they messed up the bill. We presented the 2 vouchers but they only used one of the vouchers. So they said that we can only use one per table even though it clearly stated that 2 vouchers can be used for a table of 4 or more. So they said that they would split the bill in half and use 1 voucher for each bill. They came back with the appropriate discount PLUS 30% GRATUITY. Mind you on the vouchers it stated that a  15% gratuity will be added. I am not sure if this was an honest mistake or if they were trying to pull a fast one. My friend spoke to the servers and according to them 15%+15%=30%. So in theory, if we had 4 vouchers we would be paying a 60% tip. We're letting this one go but come on a 30% gratuity? Un-freakin-believable.

We don't live in the area so we made the trek up to North York just to try this restaurant. Would I go back? Probably not. If I happen to be around the area I might give it a second chance but I don't think that it is worth the trip if you are coming from far away.  It does not live up to the hype so I was disappointed. I really want to find a go-to Filipino restaurant when I have cravings. Sadly this place aint it. 

My bf is giving filipino food one last chance...next stop La Mesa."}
{"text":"We had the lunch special. It's legit. This is real Filipino food. The service was great, presentation was lovely, and the food was delicious. Outstanding all around.  And of course, we finished off lunch with halo-halo and took home some baon."}
{"text":"I have no reservations bringing my friends here for lunch or dinner. Food is authentically Filipino with a taste that is distinctly Casa Manila's. It is a challenge choosing between the more known Max's Restaurant of Manila and Casa Manila whenever there is an occasion worthy of celebration with Filipino cuisine. To be fair, Casa Manila has a class on its own. Dining in this place takes me back home with all its Filipino décor. The place is clean, plus the owners and staff are courteous, accommodating and friendly and would explain patiently the different choices to non-Filipinos.

I have not tried their Thursday night buffet that is reminiscent of the boodle fight in the Philippines, but would like to someday."}
{"text":"Pro: Their kamayan is a one-of-a-kind experience! My non-filipino friends certainly enjoyed it. 

It was busy that Saturday lunch, so service was a bit slow. We were fortunate that our food came quickly compared to other tables and it was served to us warm. For the appetizers, we had the Nilaga (beef) soup and the Chicharon (fried pork rinds) topped with vinegar and special sauce. They banged drums as the main meal came and it was entertaining! At $30 per person, they certainly give you your money's worth. We got the bbq chicken skewers, beef ribs, jumbo shrimps, Pinakbet, and fried pork belly. It was a ton of food but we managed to surprise the restaurant owner by finishing it all! Everything was presented well and was very delicious. The halo-halo dessert was also really good, but not better than Max's. 

Con: Terrible service, inattentive servers

Two stars were removed for two reasons. First of all, we came here to celebrate a birthday and I told them in advance. They told me that they would serve the dessert with a sparkler for the birthday celebrant and the staff can sing happy birthday. This did not happen and they completely forgot about it. Second of all, your table is not assigned a server. Our group felt like once you were given your food, they just leave you alone. We were left waiting for our drinks to be refilled and it took a long time before the server clears your table for the next dish. I felt really bad for this larger group next to us because even though both our tables came at the same time, their food didn't come until we had finished ours! We asked the same waitress 3 times (as she passed by our table) for the bill and it took 30 minutes. Seriously?? They need to either have a better system or put more servers because although the food was great, I'm not looking forward to a 3-hour lunch again."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't get why the rating for this restaurant is so high. I just dined here with a groupon. I don't know if it's just me, not a Philippine, who don't find the food tasty at all. Or it's just my order happened to be bad. 

1. I don't like tab water. Maybe you would say that most of the restaurants are using it. But to be honest this tab water has a too strong \"tab water\" taste.

2. I ordered the Philippine bread. It has a taste like it's be a left over for quite a long time. 

3. The garlic chicken is so salty that I can't taste anything else. Oh well, also a bit of sour...

4. The fish that some ppl recommend. Just a normal fish which I sometimes through into my oven when I'm too lazy to cook. Nothing special. 

All in all, dont feel comfortable after eating it and won't come back again even with a voucher."}
{"text":"This place surprised me.

I never had filipino food before until I ate here, and man am I glad I ate here.

The Lechon, roasted suckling pig with crispy skin smothered in a nice beef and oyster sauce, was heavenly. Picture the most juicy peameal bacon, and roast it to perfection and add a nice beef oyster sauce, and you've got a match made in heaven.

The Karé Karé, beef or oxtail in a curry peanut sauce, was surprisingly good. A very unique and taste dish.

My favourite hands down was the pancit bihon guisado, rice glass noodles stir fried with bean sprouts, carrots, shrimp and chicken in a chicken stock sauce was dynamite. Lots of value and flavour.

A dish will run you 10 - 20$ depending on what you get, and has table service with friendly staff. A pleasant surprise to say the least, and it has an outdoor patio with a full bar. Can't go wrong.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was a very big mistake and I was very disappointed when I chose Casa Manila for the first birthday celebration of my son. I ordered every single food to be served in our hotel venue from this restaurant and made sure to call Casa Manila more than 3x prior to the event with each call accompanied by my constant confirmation of the address and time that we wanted the food delivered. Much to my stress and dismay, we were expecting the food at 11 in the morning as advised, but the delivery person did not arrive until 12 noon when some of our guests are already there! First, I was given an excuse of a heavy traffic. Are they not supposed to predict traffic and leave earlier to make it on time? Second, I couldn't believe I was given an excuse that I gave the wrong address! i checked the address sooo many times and how can someone be so stupid enough to get lost and not find a well known hotel??! I find Casa Manila VERY UNRELIABLE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. I certainly WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place for your catering needs!"}
{"text":"I was here last night to celebrate my mom's birthday and we all had a good time. Service was fast, food tasty and fresh. The owners, both husband, and wife were super friendly and they always dropped by our table to make sure we're enjoying our dinner.  

We'll come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I'm still not sure quite what to make of this place. Are they trying to be upscale or family oriented? Don't know. What I do know is if your hungry, go somewhere else. While the food here is homemade, it takes a good long time to come out. And the place wasn't packed. If the plan is to have a few drinks on the patio and get properly lubed before food comes out then this is the place."}
{"text":"What an awesome gluten free option! Such a great selection for both gluten free and vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times and their food has been consistently great.

Bicol Express - Nice balance of creamy, salty, spicy, and fatty. I could eat this all day every day if calories weren't a thing.

Sisig - Probably the best in the city. So crispy and full of flavour. You have to order it spicy! You will thank yourself.

Bangus - Perfectly seasoned and not too sour.

Kilawin - Tart, spicy, and fresh! +1 for plating it so nicely.

Halo-halo - Lots of yummy toppings and generously portioned. 1 order is good for 2 people.

Service can be hit or miss, but the owner is really nice and checks up on every table."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant for really delicious Phillipino cuisine, all items on their menu are of great texture and taste. Try out the Chicken Adobo, Pancit of various meat, sisig, kare-Kare with fish or shrimp paste, and of course , for desert end with Halo-Halo a huge pint size of 12 different flavours ranging from gelo to condensed milk, exotic fruits, crushed ice, and other sweet ingredients , a truly good restaurant for the cuisine of the Philippines :-)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I've been driving past this restaurant for 2 years and finally decided to try it because I bought a Groupon coupon. When we arrived, it was busy, but seated right away. We didn't see the waiter again for another 10 minutes. I had to flag him down. At this point I was already annoyed. He took our order, and the first dish came out in about 20 minutes.  Shortly after, the two other dishes came to our table. I don't remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but we ordered Adobo chicken, garlic brown fried rice and a noodle dish (vermincelli) with chicken and shrimp. Everything was ok. Not great, but not terrible. The noodle dish was the least favorite. The shrimp tasted and looked like it was re-cooked as it was hard and looked dried up a bit. It took a very long time to get first ask for our bill, then to actually got it. I think the server felt bad as he offered us a coupon for !5% off our next visit. 

The rest of their food may be decent, but based on their service, I will not be going back. They need to hire another waiter/waitress pronto."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Casa Manila from Filipino friends in the know, and I finally got the chance to try their food. We went during Winterlicious 2015, and I have absolutely no regrets.

The place is homey, with warm lighting, woven rattan furniture and the distinctive nipa and capiz shell accents that characterize good Filipino restaurants that serve native food (no crazy fusion, or artsy-fartsy food stuff... they serve down-home Filipino cuisine!). The windows offered a lovely view of winter wonderland (can't wait to try their patio in the summer!) but the booths beside the window go pretty fast, and we Pinoys love lingering over food and conversation, so try and make a reservation ahead of time because once a window seat is taken, it's taken for a rather long while.

The proprietress is a lovely, welcoming hostess and she always made sure we were served, and served well. She recommended the blooming tea, which came in a clear glass teapot (so you could admire the herbal flower that gave it its flavour), and tasted very like chamomile.

I ordered pork adobo with garlic rice for my main course (tip: plain steamed rice is great, too), and having had quite a few turns with adobo, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that their adobo is just delicious. Five stars, and I would go again. And again. And again. They've perfected the savoury blend of vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and peper, the pork chunks practically melted in your mouth, and the portions (we went for lunch) were a good size. 

For dessert, I had the avocado ice cream (sorbetes, in Filipino), which I was informed was homemade and was a fresh batch. The proprietress made it herself the night before. I've never had avocado ice cream that good, and I hope it's a staple although something tells me this may be a seasonal dessert., but you can bet I am going to be asking for more of it the next time around.

I've officially designated Casa Manila my favorite Filipino restaurant, but subtracting one star because of the distance from the main core (not that this will stop me from going again, but it would be lovely if they ever open a second location in downtown TO)."}
{"text":"Casa Manila in Toronto, ON was truly a place worth driving to.... especially if you came all the way from Massachusetts. We've learned that there are a lot of Filipinos in Toronto and this we found out not only because we see a lot of them just by walking in and around the downtown Toronto area but also the proliferation of Filipino stores and restaurants. 

On a recent visit, hubby booked our 4 day stay at the Westin Prince Toronto hotel located on the outskirts of downtown Toronto. It was a double pleasure to have Casa Manila located just across the road from the hotel. Days before we got there, we already made some research and found some reviews. This place is truly a jewel of a place since everything that we had there was a dining pleasure that we ate there almost everyday since my hubby's nephew missed the Pinoy's lutong bahay in the 2 weeks that they vacationed in Toronto. 

One of our favorite is the pritong pusit which was always crispy on the outside but perfectly cooked & not chewy on the inside. The Bicol express was so yummy, that it even inspired my daughter to cook it at home.  Other dishes that we have tried are the pinakbet, sinigang, palabok, kare-kare,  lechon kawali, turon, halo-halo, sapin-sapin, arroz caldo and chicken mami.

Ambiance is great and the decor is tasteful. Hubby has met and talked to the owners who were very accommodating and friendly. All in all, even if we also had a great experience in other restaurants in Toronto, Casa Manila can hold its own. Every dish here is a treasure..."}
{"text":"My family and I were really looking for this \"kamayan\" experience. Everybody I knew were raving about it so needless to say we were really eager to try. We booked a reservation the day before gave the mandatory 50 dollar deposit pre ordered our meal. We were told to be there early or on time...The place itself was nice well decorated. We were seated pretty quick. Getting our drinks took forever we had to ask 3 different server to finally get something...we waited at least an hour for food to come. Mind you...this was pre order the day before...So you would think they would have it ready. It came out dry and cold nothing I ordered over the phone the day before was on the kamayan. The people seated behind us were there before us and they never got their food and they became ajitated and left. At that point I just didn't bother telling them they got it all wrong. I should've known from the beginning. When they came by telling us that we made reservations for 6 adults when I clearly said 4 adults and 2 child. But I must say they do have really good halo halo we made sure to ask for to go cups or else we'd be there forever."}
{"text":"I have been craving chicken adobo & rice for quite some time now. A co-worker pointed out Casa Manila was around the corner and had heard good things.

Decor is nice, the trendy urban feel. Not like the typical Philipino restaurant with the TV blasting. Food smelt great and was anxious to dig in. Having a lunch special option was great with commonly eating foods on a hot table for you to choose from. Flavours are good, and as fresh as it can be for being on a hot table.

Only thing i'm going to criticize is portion size versus price.

$6.99 for lunch plate (rice & 3 chopped pieces of chicken with sauce)
$1.00 for extra item (5 pieces of crispy pata)
$2.00 for drink (eska water)

I would definitely return and try more items and write another review. It's hard to find a nice Philipino restaurant and this could be a hidden gem that people need to recognize

Till next time,"}
{"text":"I have been a big promoter of this place.  Unfortunately, I can not do that this time.  I went there for lunch on Sunday and was very disappointed.  My coffee tasted burned and I had to follow up on my order twice.  All of the people around me who arrived after me were all getting their meals as well as their take out orders before me.

Such a shame since this place was my fav filipino place :("}
{"text":"If you can find at least four people with massive appetites, then try the special Kamayan dinner (best to order in advance). After generous appetizers (chicken soup and chicharon), the main courses are presented on a large tray of banana leaves, with an abundance of plain or garlic-fried rice. Eating with your hands in the usual Pinoy fashion is a fun experience with family and friends. Remember to save some room for dessert. Some special cakes were on display, and we wished we had the foresight to buy a slice or two to bring home. I took a star off for seasoning, which was sometimes dwarfed by the excess of rice. Overall, a fun tropical experience in the GTA. Would love to go back with a crowd."}
{"text":"I would first say, their sisig is amazing and I love their decor!

My major complaint about this place are dishes like shrimp sinigang with only 3 pieces of shrimps and around 5 bukchoy leaves and about 2 slices of radish on their sinigang, which is the regular order for $16, we've experienced an hour wait for our food to arrive, with other dishes still missing. 

To me, that's way too overpriced. The same way with their tinola, fried chicken and a lot of other dishes.It does say its serves 1 or 2 people, but I eat a very small portion for each meal, to me it actually serves maybe half a person.

Their pancit is a good amount.

I really hope they change that because the taste of the food is really good. For that reason, I can't recommend it to people."}
{"text":"Woohoo!  The best thing about this restaurant is owner Miss Philippines, Mila! A true treasure to match her food!"}
{"text":"We booked the reservation and they didn't prepare for our kamayan. Then we had to wait for everything. Didn't get water and no one gave us introduction of the food. We waited for 15 minutes for our dessert and 15 mins for the bill. The entire lunch is more than 2 and half an hour while we only spent 30 mins eating...."}
{"text":"A fabulous place for us out of towners! We came in there and were immediately treated with gusto and heartfelt enthusiasm and care. We had a full spread of all things delicious (and even veggie-friendly plates!) that just kept coming, along with banter from our waiter. 

Great food, fabulous wait staff and friendly folks. What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Filipino food.  The food was good and had some flavor.  Nothing special or had a wow factor.  I came with a friend for summerlicious and thought we should give it a try because we both never had Filipino food before.  My only disappointment was the service.  It was super busy and not enough staff but then they were also new staff according to one of the waitress.  They gave the booth table which was dirty but we told her we would wait cause i wanted spacious seating. Then it was clean and we were going to sit there but the owner gave it to someone else who came after us and even the people who were waiting right behind us only because she knew them. So we had to sit down at another table which was not clean yet. Waiting..waiting..no one cleaned it till we flagged them down..then we had our orders taken but no water was brought out..the service was just overall terrible...you know that its busy for summerlicious which you should anticipate that. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"The first time that we went to Casa Manila it was for a friend's engagement party.  The food was served buffet style with various dishes offered.  My boyfriend is half Filipino and loved the food so much that after we left the party, we decided we would go back again.  When the deals were offered on Dealfind and Groupon, I bought three vouchers.  

Recently, we went for dinner.  Overall, we were very disappointed with this second experience.

We ordered:
- appetizer: sizzling beef salpicado
- entrees: manila chicken curry, pancit canton
- dessert: mango parfait sundae

Taste wise, the food was bland.  The beef salpicado was served on a sizzling hot plate but unfortunately, was lacking in taste and very greasy.  The manila chicken curry came to our table slightly cold and was almost tasteless.  The noodles were quite ordinary (like soy sauce stir fried).  The mango parfait also lacked the intense mango flavour that we would have expected in a Filipino dessert.

If I didn't have 2 more vouchers to use, I wouldn't come back.  We'll see if the next experiences prove that Casa Manila's food is inconsistent or consistently bad."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic meal at Casa Manila. This was my first true Filipino cuisine experience. It was amazing. 

From the very beginning, the staff gave a warm welcome and tended to our every need. Because we were newbies, our server recommend the dishes and we loved every one of them.

The food is fresh and coked to perfection.

I look forward to a return visit.

Mabuhay!!"}
{"text":"Good filipino decor but the food is on the blah side. Home cook filipino meals is better. I think you are paying for ambiance and not the food. Will not come back again. Ordered the following:
Kare kare -  plain
Chicken - crispy but just okay
Pancit - i could cook it better
Lumpia - meaty but okay
Beef stew - plain

All people in our group agreed its not the best filipino food."}
{"text":"It's actually quite hard to find a Filipino restaurant in the city and I've always wondered why.  I guess there are certain cuisines that lack a level of appeal or perhaps nobody is ambitious enough to push it to the limelight like some restaurants do like say, Spring Rolls, did for Thai fusion?

This is probably one of my first experiences with Filipino food so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was initially somewhat impressed but ended up leaving with a bit of disappointment.

Below is my experience on my lunch excursion:

Decor:
The place is comfortable with bench seating along the windows and long tables for larger groups in the middle.  Not sure if they're being festive but the lighting is all surrounded with paper origami star shapes.  If I were to be picky, the bench seating was a bit too close to the table or maybe I've gained weight (how dare you agree!).

Food:
The food is served similar to the likes of Manchu Wok where you choose 2-3 items for your dish and the staff fills your plate.  Now I didn't mean to degrade it to that level but I wanted to paint a picture of how the food was served.  The staff was actually very friendly and definitely gave off a family vibe but Ill get into that later.
I ordered some noodles and pork dishes which were marinated nicely.  From my experience, I would say this place is very sauce intensive but when it comes to meat textures, it fails a bit and reminds me a little of buffet food unfortunately.  Though let me re-iterate, the sauces were fantastic.

It was also cool that they had all these unique drinks that even though weren't super good, still added a bit of a fun factor.  I had a pop called Tru Orange....I'm sorry to say it wasn't TRU orange...maybe tru Orange Crush:P Still, kudos for the drink selection

Service:
Like I said, the staff was super friendly and let us try all the sauces.  I learnt that they change the buffet items everyday to keep it fresh which was impressive.  Their dinner menu is a la carte and they told me they plan on changing it up for the next year. A restaurant that constantly tries to evolve is an open minded restaurant that I appreciate.  
One thing to note is that perhaps maybe the staff and some customers are too friendly and family oriented because I saw a group of people who seem to be regulars eating these spring roll type dishes that I drooled over!  Also, I asked for a fish item which they forgot to bring out to me because they were being friendly to other customers and chatting it up.


Overall:
It's a restaurant that you should try.  Maybe my experience wasn't as good and maybe I came on a day where their items were a bit weak.  Who knows, but as I said, a restaurant looking to constantly better themselves is a good one.  Perhaps my rating will improve with more visits in the future!"}
{"text":"Delightful decor, great service and mostly yummy food. We ordered pork lumpia, Sig Sig Fries (with chicken) and Adobe Pork Belly. Despite the Adobe being a flop we look forward to trying more dishes there next time."}
{"text":"Have been here 4 times now. The service seems inconsistent. We met the owner the second time we were there, but the third time she didn't even come over. Most recently she came over several times and even brought us complimentary sprng rolls & garlic rice. It was certainly nice of her to do so, just strange to me that it was so variable. There have been other times we have waited over 20-30 min before a waiter comes over (even though I've never been there when its busy) and last night between the waiter and the owner, someone was at our able every few minutes!

The food itself can is variable. We do consistently love the milkfish. The best preparations are the sizzling milkfish and also the grilled milkfish. They are definitely must haves. The rest of the food is ok, and I Agee with others that its a bit pricey for north Toronto. Don't think I would come here without a voucher or coupon."}
{"text":"Casa Manilla is fun.  I can only imagine that this is what the Philippines looks like. Kare-Kare, mixed vegetables with bitter melon and Sisig (Fried Minced Pork's Nose & Ear). If I had only known it was pig face served on a sizzling platter before I ordered.

Everything was definitely a little less spicy and more oily than I like. Either way not bad. The decor / ambiance is very fun and very tropical. Servers were very nice. 

Would I visit again? Sure, I just like the SO mom's Filipino dishes better."}
{"text":"It was Easter weekend and I wanted to pickup some Filipino desserts for the future in-laws. Having lived in North York before, I have frequently driven passed the restaurant many times but never stopped by, and being Filipino myself, I wanted my future in-laws to try some Pinoy desserts. I am a little disappointed to say the least :( I stopped by for a takeout order for 2 slices of Cassava, a slice of Ube cake and 2 orders of Turon. I was told about 10 minutes for the Turon to be fried up. The cakes were ready to serve and packed. Granted, it was Easter weekend, but I ended up waiting 45 minutes for Turon. I  have to agree with other reviews on here regarding slow customer service. Everyone was kind, but I had to followup and go to the front to ask what was taking so long. No one came to follow up with the customer.  

Overall, 3 stars. Less 2 stars because they can use more staff or work on sprucing up on their lack of customer service. Can't really comment on the Turon, it was a bit bland, but maybe because they had to rush making and frying up a batch."}
{"text":"We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and each time was a good experience. We normally call to pick up, though. The food to me tastes very good, and my wife (she's actually from the Philippines) enjoys it too. We usually get the same dishes (chicken/fish sisig, palabok, pork belly, squid) and we're never disappointed. 

The one con is that it's expensive for the type of food that it is. We don't live close to the restaurant so we consider it a treat when we pick it up."}
{"text":"Food is good here but service is terrible here bc of being \"under-staff\".  I came here twice already to see if the service changed from weekdays and weekends.. Nope.

Other than the service, food is better here than Max's. Food is more authentic... I like their chicken sisig, kare-kare, BBQ skewers and halo-halo.

Note to the OWNERS:
If you know mostly family group of 4-10 comes here especially on the weekend and at night on weekdays, please hire more staff.  Service is one of the key to have a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Casa Manila for summerlicious 2015 with my friends , and found the experience to be okay. For the starter I had a lemon grass chicken skewer which was good. I had the shrimp dish for my main, which I found a bit underwhelming - portion was a bit small and I enjoyed the garlic rice more than the shrimp. The dessert is why I rate this restaurant a 4; the purple ube (yam) cake was very delicious: nice and light, not too sweet, and a great way to end the meal. Server seemed a bit rushed but was friendly. Would come here again just for the ube cake - yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered a dinner for two special which consisted of 2 vegetable soups, Pancit a noodle dish with vegetables and chicken, lumpia shanghai (spring rool with pork meat), pork bbq skewers, 2 bowls of rice. 

The lumpia shanghai was superb. Pork BBQ skewers were alright. Not a bad place to have filipino food. But if you're sensitve to salt ask them to lighten it up because I found it a bit too salty."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and delicious food, has all my favorites there:lechon, milk fish, sizig. Lechon was so so not as much skin as I wanted to,in general we did have enjoyable dinner. Price is above average."}
{"text":"Casa Manila live up to its name! When I first entered the restaurant, I felt like I was in Manila with the traditional Filipino interior design and Filipino music playing. The servers wore Filipinana to make it an even more authentic experience!

We ordered chicken sisig, pork belly with binagoongan sauce and fried squid.

The chicken sisig was crispy and flavorful! It was sizzling hot when served.

The pork belly with binagoongan sauce was served super crispy as well. The bagoong made it even more flavorful!

The fried squid was also soft crispy in a good way. The squid was tender.

The portion sizes were pretty good.

If you want to experience fantastic Filipino food and authentic ambience, Casa Manila is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The service is not good, we ordered sisig for appetizer, it came so late that the plate is no longer sizzling. We asked the waiter and waiter replied \"is it not?\" And the plate is clearly not sizzling in front of our eyes. The plate was returned to us with the meat burnt and became hard to chew."}
{"text":"My favourite Filipino restaurant in the GTA! We often order the kare kare (beef stew with peanut butter gravy) with extra vegetables (I love eggplant and don't mind more bok choy or string beans) which they always oblige. My wife's favourite is the crispy pata (deep fried ham hocks) which she prefers with the vinegar sauce. My kids love the chicken mami (noodle soup) and Shanghai lumpia (deep fried ground pork or chicken spring rolls). And we all love the halo halo (shaved ice, condensed milk and ice cream dessert with all sorts of goodies mixed in)! Oh, and don't forget the garlic fried rice. If you've never had Filipino food before, this is a great place to start. If you like good, traditional Filipino style homecoming Casa Manila is su casa."}
{"text":"We came to Casa Manila for Summerlicious. After we received our appetizer, it took almost an hour for our main course to come. When we followed up the first time, the waitress did not give any explanation. When we followed up the second time, the waitress gave some excuse on a \"discrepancy\" between the kitchen and front of house. There was no apology or effort to correct this mistake. I find this lack of service completely unacceptable and I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for this visit, I was quite disappointed with their binagoong pork. The flavour was good, it wasn't too salty and it was crunchy -- as it should be. It's just the pork had a smell and it was very off putting. It wasn't a smell from the bagoong. I've been eating bagoong all my life and I know it wasn't that. It was my first time having that dish at Casa Manila, but I'm pretty sure the smell was not supposed to be there. I have to say the coconut milk fish was pretty good. Second time having that and it's got a consistent light flavour. Loved it! And of course, the garlic rice. Can't go wrong with garlic rice. Have to say the service was pretty good too considering they had two big parties there when I went."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Casa Manila on a Sunday evening to experience the traditional Kamayan feast. We had seen photos of this online and that's what sparked our interest to try it. 

You need to make a reservation for this and be prepared to select the chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetable, and dessert options (which you can find on their website). Honestly, everything sounds good on the menu, so we randomly made our picks. When we arrived, the host reviewed our selections with us and noticed we picked two similar dishes and suggested we swap one out for another. It was thoughtful of her to do that! Our favourite was the fried baby squid.

The whole ambience was great from the friendly hosts, traditional Filipino decor, and the exciting way they presented the Kamayan feast.

The only downsides would be that we found it a tad pricey at $45 per person (including tax and 20% tip). Also, some of the cutlery/cups/bowls were disposable plastic and wood. It would be great if they used more reusable environmentally friendly items.

Overall, it was a unique experience and highly recommended!"}

First time I tried Filipino food was at Lamesa Restaurant located on Queen West. I do admit Filipino cuisine is still somewhat new to me- but if you know me enough, I am willing to try anything as long as it doesn't involve bugs.
Anyways, so I knew Casa Manila was one of the popular local spots for Filipino food although I've heard both the positive and negative. I still wanted to give them a try since the restaurant is so close to Galleria (Korean market) that I go to every weekend.

I dropped by for lunch on a Saturday and found the restaurant to be quite empty. I was surprised by the fact that they had a patio area since I never noticed it from outside driving by so often.
Walking inside of Casa Manila made me feel like I was at a tropical resort and I loved all the bamboo and leafy decorations.

As soon as we sat down, we were served a basket of popcorn that was seasoned with something.. I have no idea what, but it was delicious! The popcorn was salty and sweet and it immediately made me crave beer. mmMMMMMM beer.


Ordered: Coconut Ginger-Ginataang Stew 3/5

* Long beans, squash and pepper for $12.99
* For some reason I expected this dish to be served cold but it was served warm
* Light coconut sauce covered crunchy long beans where squash was buttery.
* I honestly didn't care much for the vegetables but really enjoyed the coconut sauce

Ordered: Chicken SigSig 3/5

* Served with garlic rice and fried eggs for $15.99
* Now this is something I tried and enjoyed at Lamesa
* This is meant to be mixed with the fried eggs thats served on top
* Although I do enjoy this dish, it is quite heavy and oily for my taste
* I def need some hot sauce to enjoy this since it is drenched in oil
* SigSig is one of my preferred Filipino dishes but I can't eat a lot of it

Ordered: Crispy Pork Binagoongan 3/5

* Crispy pork belly lightly sauteed in house made shrimp paste topped with tamato, eggplant, onions and green mango for $14.99
* I found this dish to be quite heavy and oily as well
* Chopped eggplants and tomato that's served with the pork somewhat helps to balance out the heaviness of this dish

Summary: Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Casa Manila but found every dish to be too heavy and way too oily. A lot of people who are familar with Filipino food has warned me in advance but it was still too much for my likings.
I would recommend Casa Manila to anybody who wants to try Filipino food since they do offer quite the variety but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came to this establishment at lunch for Moms birthday.  Once we entered the door we were greeted by the owner Mila. Mila took great care of our group right from the start with the placing of our orders and with her attentiveness throughout the entire meal. She even led a grace/prayer before meals which was a nice touch.

Courses ordered include Chicken chicharron, Kare kare, lumpia, bbq chicken, garlic fried rice and lechon kawali. I particularly enjoyed the kare kare and chicharron the most. Presentation on all the dishes were great. The quality of ingredients such as a meats and vegetables were great as well. For dessert we ordered the Ube Sans Rival Cake which I enjoyed since it was the first time having that style of cake. 

Highly recommend, especially for those who haven't experienced Filipino cuisine and are looking to take their first bite. Filipino hospitality was top notch, Mila really did take us in just as if we were family."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS for me.
Best interior of a Filipino Restaurant I've been to so far, has a tropical feel because of the coconut shells and bamboo decorations. A bit crowded, tables are close together.
We tried \"Kamayan\" with my friends (4 people in total). It's my first time in Canada. Food is great, the soup and everything else are flavourful (the grilled beef ribs, not so much, Koreans of course do that better). We like the halo-halo, lots of toppings! I like the experience of kamayan itself, made me feel 'at home'. When they serve the food you will hear drum rolls and servers will shout \"Kamayan!\" which I find a bit corny but I guess fun. We had a good laugh & cringe at the same time. Downside is, like other Filipino places they will add a gratuity (20% for this). It's kind of ok for this because they have to clean up twice, prepare a lot of food etc but still I don't know why Filipino Restos and Bars do this, food is already a bit overpriced as it is."}
{"text":"#Summerlicious 2017
I would have given this place 0 stars for awful service + shitty experience overall...but the food was actually not bad, so it's getting two instead.
Starter - soup(3.0/5.0), salad(2.5/5.0) I got the soup, my friend got the salad. The soup was lukewarm and a bit oily, but the flavor was pleasant so I ended up finishing the bowl. The salad dressing was too oily for me, too sour for my friend...but it was salad, so still edible:/
Main - chicken sisig fries(3.0/5.0), crispy pork belly(4.0/5.0) I got the chicken sisig fries, the feature item on the menu. The fries were nice, but the 'chicken' turned out to be fried oily bits that had absolutely no taste of chicken. Coincidentally, there were too few fries and too many these suspicious oily bits! (Ha!) And we all know how cheap potatoes are...:(
I tried my friend's pork belly and decided I liked it better than mine. The texture and flavor worked great together(not as oily as I would have imagined). It came with an abandunce of sides: coconut veggies, garlic rice, carrots and raddish, a healthy selection for easily-bored eaters like me. I'd pick this over my 'chicken' sisig fries any time;)
Dessert - cassava cake(3.5/5.0), caramel flan(2.5/5.0) Let me begin by saying that getting these wasn't by choice at all: we both looked up the menu beforehand, and that purple ube cake was 50% of the reason why we came here. And guess what? AFTER we finished our main, the server came up and told us it was all sold out. Wait a minute...we just saw him handing what apparently was the last slices to the group sitting next to us!! Who ordered AFTER we did, but was a larger group. Well, larger group=larger tip, that's easy math, looks like we were the more 'expendable' ones. Which probably explains why they didn't even bother saving us one tiny tasting slice -- THEY JUST DIDN'T CARE. Since we were already half-done at this point, it's not like we could get up and walk now. Jokes on us:/
Now, the desert we were forced into getting was actually not bad. (The place makes nice pictures too.) But I was so fuming at this point that it took actual self-restraint not to throw water in their faces, let alone enjoy anyt...wait a minute, that's not true -- our glasses have been empty for the past hour!! That's right, during the entire meal, we didn't get one single refill. Oh man, if only there was a way to get your money back for horrible service...:(

Will NOT be back.
Never.

(well unless they start handing out compensations for causing mental distress and ruining your day...but until then:p)

NEVER."}
{"text":"Good food with that homemade taste. Pictures looked true to what u see in the menu. Glad there were set meals with a an authentic mix for us new and lost folk. 

Wait time not too bad especially as there was a wedding happening. 

Extra star cuz both owners cared enough to take the time to visit and chat with all the patrons to ensured they were happy. 

Would recommend for Filipino food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good... the decorations.. the place... the space... no complaints... 

The food is also good... 
Service is not bad.... 
Will come back again for more filipino food... 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here last night, went with the manager's suggestions (I had no idea about Filipno Food) and the meal, service and ambiance were fantastic. I would defintely go back and found it on Yepl.ca!"}
{"text":"Must Try: BBQ Pork Skewers, Halo Halo

Rating: (8/10) Food, (7/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness

My Experience: 
 
Filipino food is hard to find in Toronto, much less delicious and authentic filipino food. First, this place is designed for groups (four or more), as majority of their dishes are fairly large and suitable for family style sharing. They are also quite busy, as I saw majority of the restaurant was either seated by large parties or reserved. 

We were seated, but took quite a bit of time in getting service; we were only given one menu for the whole table, which was a bit annoying. We ordered the fried chicken, the bbq skewers and the seafood noodles, along with their pineapple-coconut & Ube Tar smoothies. 

Although the wait staff was very friendly, it took a while for our order to come out. One friendly server, without us asking, approached our table to find out how long we had been waiting and checked on our order for us. We really appreciated the initiative from the server, however it still took almost half an hour to get our order. 

The bbq pork skewers were fairly large (at two pieces), and had a delicious favour. The fried chicken was simple, and came with a very tangy bbq sauce. The seafood noodles were quite delicious, but the wait took away from the whole experience. 

We tried the Halo Halo and Flan for dessert. We felt the flan was a big too thick and cheesy, and not what we expected. However, the Halo Halo was massive and one of the best I've had. No one person should order the Halo Halo on their own, as it requires a team to get through. The Halo Halo is a must try. 

Overall, the service took quite long. There were a couple of large parties the day we went, but the wait took away from the entire dining experience. Will return again to try the rest of the menu and hopefully have an improved experience."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place when passing by. The inside blows u away, looks very fancy like a wedding, in contrast to an exterior that looks more like a homefood place. I was a bit disappointed though with the meal. The food itself was decent, it's just that i find it drastically overpriced for what it is. Not sure if i'm biased cuz i'm asian and am used to this type of asian food at home, so to me it's way too expensive and I don't see it as fine-dining food. Regardless, wont be coming back, way too overpriced. Too bad cuz it's a very pretty place with nice ppl (filipino ppl are always so nice and pleasant!)"}
{"text":"Tried Summerlicious here on a Wednesday night with a party of 4. We made reservations ahead of time but the restaurant had available spots when we got there at 8pm (only about half full).

They have their Summerlicious set dinner menu for $28. 
I ordered: Chicken Spring Rolls - tasted good but nothing special, Crispy Pork Belly - pretty big portion, comes with garlic rice, small mango/fruit salad with coconut sauce, delicious, Cassava Cake with Custard Topping - I thought it was delicious but it could've been more moist.

My friend got the Chicken Adobo for main and Leche Flan for dessert and I thought both those dishes were super tasty as well. I would get those next time to try something new.

The service was good here. Didn't have to wait too long for the food to come or for them to take away our plates. The decor of this place was also done really well. Really festive."}
{"text":"Terrible service, ok food. Not worth the $27.99 price for brunch buffet. Selection of food was average and replenishment of dishes was slow.  The staff of 4 were very disorganized. Only one person took orders and they other three were slow to clear tables, plates and refill drinks.  My family will NEVER eat here again. Once was enough. Don't waste your money. Go elsewhere for Filipino food. I'm Filipino and would be embarrassed to take my family or friends here."}
{"text":"Hate to say it but I just visited this place and I didn't like the transformation.. They practically nailed everything to be an authentic filipino restaurant.. bamboo themed decor, Check... another Filipino female artist doing yet another \"unoriginal acoustic remake of a classic tune\" playing in the background, Check... great selection of filipino favorites in the menu, Check...

Unfortunately, along with the interior and all around upgrade came the drastic upgrade in prices but not necessarily a big upgrade in food. It occurs to me that they are trying to draw in non filipino patrons with this change but I'm sure no regular is going to pay for 2.50 for a single bowl of overcooked rice. Grilled pork belly 14$, kare kare 14-15$, and while they say the serving size is for sharing I'm not sure how many 10 year olds come in and share an entree.

In conclusion, everything is good with the exception of the food which, while not bad, is so not worth the prices you pay. Note to owners: you can't  be as expensive as Max. Your food maybe at best just as good (an i am being generous) without the name recognition. Filipinos in the GTA know lot of places that serve better food for much lower prices."}
{"text":"Came by for their winterlicious menu. The staff and service is incredible. The amount of attention they give you to make sure everything is to your liking is a whole other level. 

I started with the Filipino beef and vegetable soup then the grilled pork belly sliders and finished with their island avocado ice cream. I tried my friend's Filipino chicken rice, pork spring rolls, beef kaldereta fries, calamasi sweet & sour fish with rice and Manila tofu curry. The pork belly sliders were generously portioned and delicious and so was the Manila tofu curry - it had a strong coconut and curry flavour. The other items I tried were a little underwhelming. 

Overall the food wasn't spectacular but still good. I might come back and try their other items."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food. Prices were a little on the higher end but would come again."}
{"text":"The hosts and hostesses were friendly and accommodating.   I am no expert in Filipino food but the meals were what I had hoped for."}
{"text":"Great cuisine, beautiful atmosphere, and friendly service - feels like I am back in Manila!  Check them out and pre-order their Kamayan dinner, the traditional Filipino feast, so impressive!"}
{"text":"Average Filipino food. They serve a huge variety of Filipino dishes but the taste is somewhat average. Crispy pata is good, Kare Kare was alright, a little too creamy for us. Though you really taste the peanut flavour. The beef was chewy so we let them know and they gave us a new one. It was much better however traditionally, it is supposed to be beef ox tail, but they just served regular beef. It would pass Toronto standards for sure though. Service is good, food is fairly quick. And I don't understand why their halo halo doesn't have ube ice cream? The ultimate Filipino desert...And they are serving it with vanilla ice cream...?? :( 

Overall this is a great place for people who have never tried Filipino food as it is quite westernised and their menu is big enough to be able to accomodate different tastes."}
{"text":"- definately try the sisig (like crunchy bacon bits on a skillet), the chicken adobo was tasty, and the garlic rice. all in all - we were really impressed with the food!
- came for lunch on a friday with work colleagues - found the service very slow by the 2 servers. kitchen seemed to be fast, but found the service to be friendly, but slow. 
-  if it's still available, use the groupon! (http://www.groupon.com/deals/casa-manila-1)
- will be back"}
{"text":"I've gone to Casa Manila twice, once was for Summerlicious and then for Kamayan with about 10-12 people. 

Kamayan Experience:
The Kamayan was okay, we (the three of us who went for Summerlicious) felt it was better. Maybe we didn't pick the best options, but we hoped we would have had the same experience we did with Summerlicious. The worst was the service however. We had to wait over an hour just to get our bill. We must have asked them over 8 times for the bill and they kept saying okay but it never came. A couple of us had to get up to approached the server for our bill. They also had so much trouble trying to get the math right with our bill. Also bear in mind that the gratuity of 20% is already included. It was really bizarre to have to wait so long for the bill. We we were very tired and frustrated at that point.

Summerlicious Experience:
We all felt we were on vacation in the restaurant. We got the pork skewers, spring rolls and their house salad as appitizer. They were all good, though the salad was a little bit lack luster. For entree we got pork belly and rice, ox tail and their sisig fries. All was very fantastic  (we wete particularly impressed by the vegetables!) and the flavours were definitely singing. Just a fair warning, the sisig fries is very heavy, perhaps more lemon or lime to cut the fat would help. 

For dessert we got the cassava cake, creme caramel and another cake which I forgot the name of (I was going to order their corn ice cream but apparently they did not have any ice cream available which I was really disappointed about). The creme caramel was a winner for all of us, then the mystery wafer nut cake and then the cassava cake.

Overall I recommend for the 'licious events for sure, but can't say we would want to do Kamayan again.

{"text":"I have no idea how this place only has a 3 star rating!! I've dined at this restaurant a handful of times (twice for kamayan) and each visit has been fantastic. Food and service have been equally delicious and I particularly enjoy their Kare-kare. My husband, Rae, and I were very appreciative of the owners hands-on approach as well. She visited every table, talked to each guest, and did not hesitate to get her hands dirty, picking up dishes along the way. Certainly won't be the last time we visit. Looking forward to trying the Sunday breakfast buffet!"}
{"text":"- came in, had 3 people try to seat us (pretty disorganized) 
- they knew in advance the timing of when I'd come but still had to wait for our table to be cleaned
- told the girl brown rice, yet she came back with white. When I let her know, she tried to tell me that I said 'white' but I'm not forgetful, and I did ask for brown rice. My mother even backed up my claim since she heard me order it earlier 
- thankfully she didn't charge for my second order of rice (1 star) -___-\"
- a round of waters took half an hour to come together at our table
- drinks took decades in general
- food, eons... 
- washrooms, no soap
- asked for the poutine chicken sisig, but the waitress just brought the fuckin sisig.. Like SHIT, invest in some hearing aids or don't work in a restaurant! OR at LEAST repeat the fucking order afterwards if you weren't even sure wtf you just heard. GOD DAMN THIS PLACE SUCKS.
- when I received the bill, they charged me for tea and coffee which was never even ordered ? ? ? For real guys? Is this a standard charge on everyone's reciept?? 
- one of the meals was an extra dollar more for no reason (SERIOUSLY.....) so obviously they had to adjust it once i found the error. Maybe they overcharge everyone before since no one noticed... 
- I was left so disappointed because it was mother's day and i tried to plan a decent lunch with my family, and they all ruined it... From beginning to end.... And all they got was a free rose...... Like............. How does a free rose make up for poor execution, poor service, terrible accommodations. It doesn't. Anyways, I would never recommend this place to anyone, ever. This business is a mistake."}
{"text":"Me and my wife (girlfriend at the time) went to this place while we vacationed in Toronto.  Their sisig is the best I've ever had in my life.  I've been trying to find a place in San Diego that compares to it and there's none.  The other dishes were also good, however, the only dish I didn't like was the pusit.  If you want some good filipino food in Toronto, make sure you check this place out."}
{"text":"We did a Drive by for halo-halo take-out. Delicious fresh ingredients , perfect balance of sweetness . Friendly staff. Place clean and well presented. Parking is a different story. Very limited parking."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with three friends. We got pork lumpia as the appetizer and waited over half an houe as I think they were trying to fill their takeout orders. i got chicken sisig and my companions tried the chicken adobo and grilled pork belly with garlic rice. The adobo was too salty and my friends compared it to overly salty soy sauce marinated chicken. I did not enjoy the crunchiness of the sisig after awhile as my jaw was tired from chewing the crunch. The pork belly was delicious however! The staff were very welcoming, but nearing the end we felt like we had to fight for their attention and waited 15-20 minutes for water and the bill even though we were one of two tables. I would come back again to try the kamayan."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough about this restaurant. It was my first time in Toronto and my bf met up with his cousins who met us for dinner at Casa Manila. I'm from NY and am loyal to Grill 21, but this is for sure my new go to place if I'm ever in Canada. It was 7 of us so we got a number of different dishes, none of which disappointed me in the least bit. The sisig was incredible, the onions were cooked but still maintained some crunchy consistency and the pork was perfectly fried without being chewy and overly oily. The lumpias were flavorful and were complimented well with the dipping sauce. Not much to say about the Garlic rice except it was soo good! The Krispy pata is a must have- fried to perfection. The pancit was really good, and normally I don't like it because the noodles are sticky and it changes the texture of the dish, but it was really good and the vegetables were well incorporated. For dessert I had the halo halo which was good as well except I wish it had more flan as it only had one small piece. We also ordered some pieces of ube cake and mango sansrival. I'm not biased or anything, but it was probably one of the best, if not the best cake I have ever had in my life. I am very very particular when it comes to desserts and usually think cakes and cupcakes taste bad, but that was beyond delicious. The creaminess of the frosting and the crunch of the meringue layers is unmatched. It was so good I ordered an extra one to bring back home to the USA. I give this place the highest rating possible."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. 
We came at 7:20 and the food came out at 8:20. They served to people that came after us first. We asked if our foods were ready for many times and they kept saying it was almost almost and almost. We came with kid and they just let the kid be hungry the whole time. We even finish all the drinks and still nothing. 
Finally, foods came out VERY COLD and were not as expected. We did not eat much afterward because the hunger was gone. 

DO NOT COME HERE. You will get nothing but mad."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance and the staff are quite friendly. The food is pretty good. I like their crispy pata and lechon. However, I don't go there anymore because the service is so damn slow every time I go there. The last time I went there, my friend and I went there and waited over an hour just to get an appetizer. My non Filipina friend always wanted to try this place and was very disappointed in the experience. Being Filipina myself, I felt a little embarrassed by it because I wanted her to see how great Filipino food is. Unfortunately, the wait time totally ruined the evening for us. To top it off, the meal turned out to be underwhelming and was a bit on the cool side. The waitress did apologize for the wait, but an hour to wait for a meal is ridiculous. If you choose to go, make sure you aren't starving beforehand because wait times are long. Maybe this isn't the norm, but it's been like that for me every time I've gone there."}
{"text":"Staff were super friendly. It was fairly busy but I had also gone during winterlicious. Service was slow but the food was well worth the wait. We ordered chicken skewers on the side which came much later  than our appetizers but it was quite good. I had the Manila Chicken Curry which was tasty but the Coconut Beef was definitely much better. For apps, I had the local beef and vegetable soup which was nice and light -- the perfect start to my meal. For dessert, I had the banana crepe which was good but the crepe was incredibly crispy kind of like a cookie. 

Overall, I would return because the ambiance was nice and the food was also very good. There were several things on the regular menu that I would have liked to try as well. :)"}
{"text":"Our good friend decided to celebrate his birthday party at Casa Manila with the Kamayan feast. We had a group of 13 people. This is my second time having the Kamayan, this time the food was actually served warm and tasted much better than my first experience. HOWEVER...

The service still has not improved. Once you get your main meal, they do not come and check up on you. It took 40-45 minutes for them to bring the bill. We had asked politely again after 30 minutes, and were informed that they were \"preparing it and looking for the ticket.\" When we received our bill, we were charged for 15 people even though we only had 13. They refused to take off the extra charges because our initial reservation was for 15. They could have easily not charged us for the two extra people who were unable to make it. They had more than enough time since the main course did not arrive closer to 8pm and our reservations were for 6:30pm. They could have just added less rice, and taken off two pieces of fried chicken and a few other pieces of meat. We would understand if they had to charge us, if 50% of our group didn't show up, but that was not the case. On top, our birthday guest added a generous tip not knowing there was already gratuity included in the bill, an honest mistake, since the server/staff did not make it clear when they brought the bill. When our group mentioned this in front of the staff, she did not offer to refund that extra amount a whole extra $91. Since the credit card was not processed yet, it was an easy fix. SO they charged an extra $28 x 2 persons (not including taxes and gratuity) and $91 = $165 EXTRA THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE CHARGED. Our entire group was very turned off by this experience. It's really too bad because the food is actually pretty good. We will not be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch. The service was great! We ordered the beef soup, terrine (appetizers), chicken and pork adobo (mains), leche flan, ube icecream (dessert). I'd definitely recommend the pork adobo. The leche flan and the ube icecream were absolutely heavenly. I want to come back for the kamayan."}
{"text":"Of all the filipino restaurants i've tried, this is the best in terms of taste and value. Their crispy pata (pork knuckles) is heavenly, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Their oxtail stew or kare kare is made with crushed peanuts which i love. Caldereta is good as well as their longganisa. The only dish i am not a fan of is the palabok which i think they should re-design as it is below par."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at 830pm last night and decided to go in early hoping that we were able to get seats at an earlier time.  When we got there, it went according to plan. We got seated and waited about 10mins for our waiter, which was fine because we were able to look at our menu plus the restaurant was busy; however, we knew what we were going to order since we looked at the menu ahead of time. Our water wasn't served until our waiter came. 
We places our order and our dishes came within 10-15mins after. The food was good and the service was good. The waiters checked in on us and filled our glasses of water.  I would recommend people to give this place a go."}
{"text":"It's definitely more about the experience than the food itself. Kinda dissapointed with the food considering it was practically $40 per person. The meats were okay, but I found the beef to be a little tough, and the chicken to be a little bland. The fried squid had an odd texture, and the rice had a hard texture that wasn't super appetizing. However, I found the crispy pork to be really good; nice a crispy, pairing really well with the chili oil. As well, the vegetable stew was good featuring well prepared bok choy and beans. I was impressed with the halo halo that came with the meal; if was large enough with sufficient toppingd to feed 6 people. Overall, a great experience with super friendly staff trying to make your time there great. However, in terms of Filipino food, kinda just mediocre in terms of flavour and texture."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went here for dinner a few nights ago. There were only few servers working at that time. It took us a while to get seated since there is no one to help us, but that's okay since all of the servers were busy at the moment. 
We ordered one of their combos menu. It comes with 3 dishes + rice that is good for 2-4 people. We also ordered sisig since one of my friends were craving for it. There is nothing special with the food honestly. The sisig was sooo dry!  When the bill came, we were shocked by the price. We didn't know casa manila is a bit pricey. We paid around $120 for 3 people. 
All in all: the food was okay, servers were friendly, good ambience, but not worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place because he was across the plaza at the Persian restaurant and this place smelled SO GOOD that he had to go in and take a menu for later.

When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the decor - very cute. A server(?) brought us to a table right away, and we started perusing the menu. Everything looked delicious, but we were on a semi-budget so couldn't order a lot of the stuff we would have loved to try *by the look of things*. 

So, being that we hadn't tried Philippine food before, we chose one of the combination platters at the back that came with Tofu and Pork stir fried, fried squid, and a seafood dish with all sorts of yummy sounding seafood. 

It took us a while, and the waiter came and asked up for drinks. Got water, received it, ok.

It took 30min for the waiter to come back to take our order. We had to physically ASK someone else to take our order because we were getting so hungry. And right after we ordered? They brought out the food of the couple beside us and put it on our table. We were surprised and passed the rightful food over to them.

Another 30-45 minutes later, our food comes out. Now, again, I stress that we haven't tried this type of food before, but we are big and not super picky eaters, so we weren't expecting to be so heavily disappointed (we rarely are). But the squid was SO crunchy it hurt to bite through the crust from the deep frying, and the seafood dish was mushy and disgusting. The only semi-passable dish was the tofu and pork, but there was a lot less of this dish than the other ones.

The only thing we enjoyed was the garlic fried rice.

The staff and service was worse than I've ever experienced in any place. The waiters MUST have been stoned or have had absolutely no experience with serving, because this was just laughable. The food was also not to our taste, and we can't really imagine to anyone else's either. 

Disappointed, and for a price tag of $50, we expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a couple of my Filipino friends who knew the cuisine here well. So, I took a laissez-faire approach and just let the pros order. We got two combos (2 and 3) and some garlic rice on the side. Combo 2 included the crunchy pork sisig, manila chicken curry, and vermicelli noodles. I really liked the sisig, the crunchy texture of the meat really complemented the soft garlic rice. Combo 3 had the peanut beef vegetable stew, tomato garlic beef stew, and the boneless milk fish. The beef stew was tender, flavourful, but not too overwelming. The milk fish's crispy skin and flavouring was delicious. There was a shrimp paste that came with the combos, which was very flavourful (maybe even a bit over powering), but this went well to help finish up the leftover rice. Although we did not get the signature adobo dish, I would recommend the sisig, tomato garlic beef stew and the milk fish if you are ordering a la carte!

The service was great. The servers came to check on us very frequent. Maybe it was because we came after the lunch hour, our food came out relatively fast. Overall, it was a great intro to Filipino food for me!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this Filipino restaurant and all it's offerings. The food is always fresh and made without msg! 

I have tried most of the dishes such as kara kare, adobe chicken, the skewers, lumpia shanghai, beef soup, tamarind soup, garlic rice and more!

This restaurant serves more 'family style dishes' where everyone can share. 

One thing I would say is if you want variety, it can get pricy so go with a group that's hungry to eat!  

The service is good and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"This place has a nice and chill atmosphere. I have been here on separate occasions and usually with my Filpino friends so they tend to order and know what is good. This time we ordered Kare-Kare with a side of rice and their fried milkfish. The Kare-Kare (oxtail peanut sauce) was so creamy and very filling for two people, we even took home leftovers. The milkfish was also very delicious and fresh. My friend also recommended her nation's drink calamansi juice which is made from lime. I had their calamansi juice mixed with iced tea and it was very refreshing indeed.  Definitely a place I will be back to with friends or to try out their KAMAYAN adventure where you eat with your hands over banana leaves."}
{"text":"Disappointed because I really love Filipino food but quality and service here was a little lax.

Food is average: it's very much dressed up Filipino take out food you can find anywhere -  nothing really unique about the food. They don't have a signature style as with other Filipino restaurants that have emerged in Toronto like Lamesa or Platito. The food did not seem very fresh, and when we tried to make adjustments the waiter said we could not because the food was \"already prepared\". 

Mandatory gratuity: 20% for large groups, Toronto average is 15%-18%.  

Service is bad: servers are very disorganized, we had to ask for cutlery and napkins, servers never came by to ask what we needed, refills of water took 30mins.

Atmosphere: crowded without a waiting area, it was very very hot inside, tables are squished beside each other - barely any space to walk around, no soap in the bathroom."}
{"text":"A nice place to try pinoy food; warm and attentive services. 

They have a fantastic bagoong sauce (fermented fish/shrimp sauce) which makes everything tastes more flavourful and better. If they don't bring it to you automatically with dishes like Kare-Kare, ask for it. 

Sisig means pork bits fried to perfection in English. I prefer the spicy version as it provides an added layer of flavour and cuts through the grease nicely. 

Without the bagoong sauce, their Kare-Kare is pretty average. Beef pieces are tender enough, the peanut butter sauce is quite thick. Throw the bagoong in and you are in a whole different world of taste sensation. 

Baing Bangus (pan-fried milkfish) is little bit on the dry side, dowsing it with lemon juice or light soy sauce that accompanies the dish helps 

The only disappointment is Halo-Halo dessert, shaved ice texture was lumpy and uneven, not enough sweetened condensed milk drenched over the ice, the toppings were colourful but the beans were overcooked and too mushy. I really like shaved ice dessert and have tried different versions across Southeast Asia (cendol in Malaysia/Singapore, Thai version Che Thai, che ba mau in Vietnam, Korean bingsoo, and the Taiwanese version, HongKong version). I really can't say that Casa Manila's version is good."}
{"text":"I went with 2 friends to Casa Manila 3 days ago and being the second filipino restaurant I've ever eaten it, it was pretty good.  We ordered lumpiang shanghai (nice typical spring rolls), BBQ chicken skewers (not bad but not memorable either), crispy pata (delicious although not recommended for the health conscious!), sinangag plate (first time sampling garlic rice and pleasantly good), pancit canton (a little disappointing, prefer the Chinese equivalent of cantonese chow mein), special halo-halo (can never go wrong, it was delicious and of good price and portion size) and leche flan (unfortunately, the burnt caramel gave it a rather smoky taste).  The service was a bit slow though.  The servers only visited our table to bring out our food.  We never had a water refill and had to wait to flag them down to get one.  We had to wait to ask for our bill as well.  Overall, it was a pretty good meal with reasonable pricing, nice ambiance and free parking.  Can't go wrong.  Wished there was another location in central or west Toronto though."}
{"text":"Went here with a non-Filipino friend hoping to try and see what this restaurant has to offer - too bad the only thing we saw and experienced was waiting game: 5 mins to be seated plus another 20 mins of STILL waiting for our orders to be taken.  Yes, my friend and I was disappointed as we walked out.  It was lunch hour, 10 mins to 1pm on a Monday. Good 70% of tables are taken,5% Reserved empty tables. Has 3 servers with one of them taking the orders himself.  Seriously?? That's a busy time and under-staffed?? I even overhead someone saying \"Finally\" when the wait staff asked for their orders which admittedly was a bad sign while we are waiting to be seated.  Their order started coming after almost half an hour too.  
IT was my first time to come there and I don't think I'd recommend the place to visiting hungry Filipino friends and relatives as walk in clients.  I'd say either you pack a lot of patience or you have lots of time to spare if you plan to come to this place to 'try it out'.  Their food maybe great and such a convenience for me to satisfy my Pinoy food cravings  (5 mins away from me) but hey,  I was never a fan of slow service.  Maybe in a few years, Casa Manila - I'll have a chance to be served with mouth-watering food,eh??"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant when I enter it. The style of their decoration is tropical and bright. It must be a very good idea to have family and group having dinner here.

I really want to try the authentic Philippine Kamayan and it's said Cash Manila have the best kamayan in town. Since I only brought two of my friends(minimum of 4 guests required), I'll definitely come back for kamaya.

Beef shank  in broth is awesome. We all wanna add some pho or noodles into it!
7 up Jumbo shrimp tastes good but four shrimps is just a small portion.
The grilled pork belly is average. I like their drinks very much. We ordered Sago's gulaman, coconut dream and calamansi mocktai.  The mocktai is very refreshing.

Service is good. All the staff are friendly, nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I came to Casa Manila for their summerlicious lunch menu. This is the first time I tried Filipino food.

I had:
- CASA Manila Salad with Calamansi & Sesame Dressing (vegan): the salad was very fresh, there was an abundance of sesame dressing but the salad was not at all soggy

- Crispy Pork Belly | Lechon Kawali (local): the crispy pork belly and garlic rice was delicious! The side of vegetables were coated in a yummy ginger and coconut sauce. The portion was okay but the presentation was on point.

- Ube Cake: I'm glad that ube is gaining hype now. The cake was delicious, it was light and cakey to me. It wasn't too sweet.

The service was good, only refilling waters was an issue but the food came out pretty quickly. When we came in, the owner (I think it's the owner because of a poster I saw) greeted us, sat us, and took our order which was really nice. Another point that the washrooms are really clean."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cute, and I highly recommend it for dates, or groups, birthdays, and a place to connect with Filipino culture. This is my favourite Filipino restaurant by far. The food is great and it's definitely good value. We ordered sisig, garlic rice, sinigang, casa manila salad, grilled beef, grilled pork belly, halo halo, ube smoothy, fresh lumpia, and crispy pata. Everything was great. 

My complaint is that they are understaffed, we refilled the waters our ourselves with a pitcher that was left from another table.  The staff were also quick to turn away which caused order mix ups. I received fried lumpia, which was then changed to fresh lumpia with an egg wrap after I mentioned three times that I would like it wrapped in fresh lettuce. I also asked or the dressing to be on the side because I wasn't sure what was in it, I realized after taking a bite that it wasn't. I received rashes on my face  due to an allergic reaction on the way home after eating. I wish my requests were taken seriously, but I guess I should have thought twice and should have asked more questions once I got my meal. 

This place gets super busy so it's best to reserve a table online. 

Overall, I would come back because I want to support my culture, but I'd specify my food restrictions a again before eating"}
{"text":"I went there for two special events and one sit down lunch. The food was tasty especially bikol express, crispy pata, palabok, and lumpia. I enjoy most of their food - adobo, kare-kare and grilled pusit. It's very flavorful and I have eaten other Filipino dishes before and this can certainly compare! 

I will definitely go back with my family and friends."}
{"text":"A lot of positive reviews stemming from the UYE, but unfortunately my non-UYE experience was not as stellar.

On a Friday night, you have to bring your A++ game when it comes to service.  With higher than normal volumes of diners rolling in, the room for error closes in.  We had barely just sat down and the server came to take our orders.  Maybe the regular Filipino population could just cite off menu items off the top of their head (and in their sleep), but being the first time I have ever had Filipino food, I was overwhelmed.

I presented my Deal Find voucher and he took my iPhone to take down the number.  Then when I asked for the bill, again they asked to see it.  Do I look that sketchy?  

Seeing as I had never been before, I ordered some \"Yelped and true\" dishes including:

Mango Salad - Mango usually makes everything better, but these mangoes were tart, and the spicy salad \"dressing\" was underwhelming.  

Kare Kare - Peanut butter is a rich condiment, so I was disappointed that this dish was so bland and lacking in flavour.  I did read on their menu that they practice the \"low-sodium\" mantra but does low-sodium necessarily equate to flavourless? Hm.. I will add however that the beef was really tender.

Garlic Fried BROWN Rice - This was pretty tasty.  The Fried Shrimp Paste sauce that comes with the rice - do not use it sparingly.  It adds a ton MORE flavour to the already garlicky rice.  In fact, get one dish of sauce to yourself!

Daing Na Bangus (Pan Fried Milk Fish) - I enjoyed it.  The skin was perfectly crisp and golden-brown and the fish itself was tender and flaky.  However, there wasn't a whole lotta flavour.  (See the trend yet?)

Sizzling Pork Sisig - The texture of this dish takes awhile to warm up to.  First, you have to get over the hurdle that this dish is made from the most unwanted parts of a pig (e.g. snout, ears).  And I could've sworn that some of the \"crunch\" came from actual pork bones that were ground up into the dish.  However, I did like how it was buttery and creamy as it was a nice textural balance to the crunch.  

For dessert, I had to try the rainbow-coloured Halo Halo.  This is a dessert with shaved ice as its base, evaporated milk, and a mix of sweetened fruits and beans.  My favourite part was the coconut, and ube paste and ice cream.  

We also tried the Ube cake, which was spongey and light and had just the right amount of icing (that wasn't just a vat of butter and sugar).

I felt like picking up a tambourine while I was at Casa Manila; the names of their dishes are quite rhythmic.  Kare Kare, Halo Halo, Sapin Sapin - *gasps* was Jacob Two-Two Filipino?"}
{"text":"This is my first time at a Filipino restaurant and I didn't know what to expect. By the end of the meal, I'm pretty happy I came. The food is pretty delicious. The only downside is that I find the prices a bit high.

We ordered Kare Kare and one of the noodle dishes whose name escapes me. I spent maybe 15 minutes reading the menu but I can barely remember any of their names. Don't get me wrong, there are English descriptions but the name titles are foreign to me. This is a good thing to me because it makes me feel like I'm getting authentic Filipino food. 

Anyways, the Kare Kare is unique tasting. It uses peanut butter sauce but it's smooth enough that it doesn't feel like you're eating peanut butter. It goes surprisingly well with the beef (oxtail). The noodle dish was a little less noteworthy. I was expecting a stronger taste from its color but light tasting is good too. My main disappointment with the noodle dish was that it lacked seafood and pork. The description says it comes with shrimp, squid rings, pork and fish flakes. It only had fish flakes. I wish I noticed sooner and waved down the waiter to correct this. We didn't remember the dish was suppose to have seafood and stuff until after the meal. Well...it's pretty hard to remember what each dish is supposed to have when it's the first time trying such dishes. 

So yeah, I'm deducting 1 star for screwing up my noodle dish and another star for unreasonable prices. I looked around the restaurant and think the dish sizes are pretty small considering the prices. If I may sum it up, it's nice being able to try out new ethnic foods. There are not many Filipino restaurants in the GTA. With prices like these, I don't think it's acceptable to be missing the main ingredients in a dish. So if I decide to explore Filipino food further in the future, I think I'll try another place. The decor is nice but I don't like paying a premium for that."}
{"text":"Summerlicious nightmare! Do not come here unless you have a few hours to wait! I cannot comment on the food as our table did not receive any after over an hour wait! Service is beyond slow and we were not the only table experiencing this issue. The table next to us had to wait an hour before receiving appetizers and waited at least another half hour with no mains in sight. For us, after an hour and half without any food arriving at our table, we had no choice but to walk out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service (very friendly, fast and helpful servers who answered inquiries about menu items/cuisine ...and made conversation!), and delicious food. My friends and I decided since we had never tried Filipino food, we would try it for the first time together. We had a great experience at Casa Manila! One of the friends I went with to eat is Filipino and a culinary school graduate himself, so when he says he enjoyed the food, then it's good! Everything was so flavourful, authentic tasting and well-cooked. Prices are a bit expensive for what I'd regularly pay for a meal but it was worth every penny for the experience, for my first time eating Filipino food. Decor is a bit ecletic, but it was a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. Good for groups, and the population consisted of families and young people having Filipino food. The chicken adobo was delicious, would recommend it 100%."}
{"text":"We usually come here to get our Filipino food fix. We've been here several times over the past couple of years. The most recent visit was on Mother's day. My husband booked a reservation ahead of time just because it was Mother's Day and he was worried the place would be busier than normal. When we got to the restaurant, we gave us a table for 13 people. We were only 3. No harm done on our part but I sure hope they didn't switch our reservation with someone else's who asked for a table for 13. Service can sometimes be spotty. For instance, the dishes can come quickly but we had to wait quite a bit for the dessert. 

The staff are friendly and nice including the owner who likes to interact with the diners. 

For the food, my favorites are lechon kawali, sisig, laing, pancit malabon/palabok, liempo, binagoongan (pork). On this visit, the pancit malabon/palabok was served with thin noodles. The thin noodles tend to absorb a lot of the sauce which makes the dish dry. I should have asked whether they changed the recipe or they just ran out of thick Malabon-type noodles. I hope it's the latter since I really love their pancit malabon/palabok.

We don't live near the area so we order a lot and bring home the leftovers. We love coming here because I find the menu has better selection than Max's and it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Tried the summerlicious dinner menu. Absolutely amazing! Everything was beyond perfect. Service was exceptional. Food was mouthwatering and atmosphere was cozy and friendly. I will definitely be going back in the future. I've always passed this restaurant and never knew it was so good! And the price was incredible! 

Starter: Grilled BBQ Pork Skewers
Tender and juicy. BBQ sauce was perfect combination of sweet and tangy 

Main: Crispy Pork with garlic rice and coconut ginger vegetables 
Pork was PHENOMENAL! So crispy but still melted in your mouth. Rice was perfectly cooked with the garlic flavour and the coconut ginger vegetables had me in heaven! The flavours all worked together perfectly. My friend had the Beef and Oxtail Kare Kare. It was really good too. 

Dessert: Ube Cake
Moist, fluffy, not overly sweet. The taro reminded me of Hawaii. Perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Overall, LOVED IT! this is a new restaurant option on my list."}
{"text":"We just left from casa Manila we are a party of six , we don't have any reservation but they tried their best to accommodate us. Thanks Doods your the bestdefinitely coming back."}
{"text":"Bad service

- waited 30 minutes for the appetizers 
- had to ask multiple times for water"}
{"text":"First impressions: The restaurant decor is beautiful and elegant and seemed like a very quaint place to dine in. Before the night even started, it took us one hour to be seated. (No hostess, understaffed and half the tables were empty, but they implied that they could not sit us because it was \"busy\"). 

So we sat down and proceeded to order 3 bowls of steamed rice, pork si sig, 2 beef sinigang, milk fish and lemongrass chicken skewers. 

The two bright spots in the meal was the pork si sig (super crispy, with a wonderful after taste) and the milk fish which was tender and succulent. 

The beef sinigang was very sour (tamarind was the dominant ingredient compared to the other ones). 

Overall, we find this place to have decent food but very poor service. 

I would definitely give this place another try if they can fix the staff issues."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first dining experience at CASA manila.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was really fascinated by the decor - warm and inviting, well-lit with selections of booths and long tables for large groups.  I initially waited approximately 2 minutes before I was even acknowledged by an employee - which surprised me as one was serving the table immediately to my right after entering, plus there are bells on the door that announce your arrival.  I'm not usually one to wait, and have left establishments on the same street before for this reason.  But alas, as the saying goes, \"Good things come to those who wait\".

After reviewing the menu that has a tremendous amount of dishes for such a small restaurant, I chose the Adobo Chicken and Pork.  The server stopped by a second time to confirm my order and I again advised 'with rice and vegetables'.  When my food arrived, I waited and and no rice or vegetables arrived.  I stopped my server and after asking, I felt like I was provided a little bit of Asian attitude with the 'well when I stopped by and asked you said...' response I received.  Once we had that cleared up, it was a great remainder to the evening.  Food returned as ordered BOTH times by a different, female server.  She apologized for the error.  Adobo Chicken and Pork was delicious.  Keep in mind that dishes from the Philippines sometimes contains vinegar which can lend it to be on the sour side, so exercise caution in choosing dishes.  Another server, white guy, tall with black hair and beard - IS AWESOME.  I wish I had gotten his name because he was so personable and friendly, he's the reason I stayed and ordered dessert.  He brought a menu over and turned it to the dessert pages, made a couple of suggestions and took my order.  Really, really nice guy and highly recommend you sit at his table if you can.  For dessert, I order the Flan with Taro ice cream.  Man, the taro ice cream was out of this world phenomenal!  Flan, by itself, while on the firm side was great however the caramelized sugar for the flan is incredibly sweet.  I removed the custard from the syrup and only ate what was on the flan itself. 

Overall, good experience and I will be dining here again on my next business trip to Toronto.  Great dinner location for those staying at the Westin Prince Hotel across the street."}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience I've ever had! 

Hailing from somewhere else in the far reaches in the GTA, I took the journey here with my friends. I like filipino food but I've never really experienced something as amazing as this.

The owner is so friendly, informative, and provided such a great one-on-one service. The company I had with me were so impressed and we kept raving about this place during and after the meal. From the get go, as soon as we walked in, we were blown away by the beautiful decor and atmosphere. We were treated like old friends and we were blown away. 

We had the traditional Kamayan meal, or as I would like to call it...A FEAST! Banana leaves were set up on the table. Already, I was taken aback by the delicious and familiar smell of banana leaves. It reminded me deeply of home. As the meal progressed, the owner explained each dish in great detail. They banged on a drum as they presented the huge platter (?) of food! We even got a demo of how to eat the food because we had to everything with our hands. Which was awesome! 

The soup brought out at the beginning was flavourful and nutritious. The deep fried chicken skin appetizers were to die for. I swear I could have eaten 20 of these things. From what I remember, Kamayan consisted of garlic shrimp, lechon (sic?) - crispy skin pork, shortribs, ginger and coconut infused butternut squash and green beans. Sitting over a bed of (unlimited!) perfectly cooked rice. 

Everything was so flavourful and delicious. The sauces that accompanied the dishes were so complimentary and made everything. Especially the pickled vegetable slaw! Oh my lord, I was so full and happy. 

I would definitely take the trek to come back here again, with an even emptier stomach so I can finish the delicious dessert - halo halo!

Oh, and the most delicious drink I've ever had - COCONUT DREAM! No other milkshake can compare to this beauty. One of my friends had 4 of these."}
{"text":"Bland...tasteless...slow service on a saturday. Expensive! If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go. I ordered crispy pata...no taste at all and grilled squid that is also tasteless. Halo halo is also at no par with other cheaper filipino restaurants. This will be my last time here. It's a waste of money!"}
{"text":"I saw them featured on the food network, \"You Gotta Eat Here \". The food was good, I would go back, even if just for the mixed noodles and spring rolls, plus there were a few things I didn't have room for that I would still like to try. The service was fairly fast, especially for the food, however they seem a little unorganized."}
{"text":"I've gotta say that I really enjoy the food here, however, the service is not up to par. Came in a dead Friday afternoon, around 1pm. There were 2 servers who seemed to not have been around half the time. Usually, in restaurants, servers are diligent in making sure that the customers are enjoying their meal. This was not the case, we had to wait for such a long time and eventually called them over to grab our dessert order. This was also the case when we wanted to pay and leave. Noticed the couple beside us waited a good twenty minutes before their order was taken. Meanwhile, the young server prioritized cleaning a few tables before coming up to them to take their order. We usually come here occasionally but after constant disappointment due to their service, I don't think we will anymore."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to celebrate my birthday. A week before coming here, my friend e-mailed the restaurant to ask if it was okay for her to bring a cake to the restaurant the night of, store it in their fridge, and have it for dessert after dinner. She got a reply saying that it was okay, so that's exactly what she did. At the end of the night, after we all paid for our meals, the waitress suddenly pulls me aside and tells me that she wants me to pay a $10 fee for having brought our own cake, and for their paper plates and plastic forks they provided us to eat the cake with (which we did not even ask for). I was completely caught off guard, as we were not aware of this charge, especially since my friend had e-mailed in advance and they never mentioned any associated charges in the e-mail OR at the beginning of the night when we brought the cake in. The waitress then proceeded to say that she would be \"nice\" and bring the charge down to $6 since we were not aware of the fee. She also mentioned that she'd prefer I didn't tell my friends because it would be \"awkward\", which is why she pulled me aside as the birthday girl. I didn't want to ruin the night by arguing with her, so I just paid the $6 fee, but the whole situation was just unacceptable. I'm very disappointed with their dishonest service, and we will definitely not be returning again. 

As for a review of the food... Since it was all our first time at the restaurant, and we don't have much experience with Philipino food, we asked the waitress for recommendations. We ended up ordering 4 things between 4 of us, and it was just enough food.

1) Chicken Tangy Garlic Adobo ($16) - The best dish we had that night! The chicken was tender and not dry, since it was seeped in the plate of marinade sauce. However, I did find that the soy sauce flavour was a little too overpowering, and wish that the garlic flavour came through more. 

2) Fried Garlic White RIce ($3.50) - We ordered this to eat alongside the chicken to off-set some of the saltiness. The rice was fluffy, and the garlic seasoning added a nice aroma and refreshing taste to it. 

3) Milkfish ($17) - The waitress definitely over-hyped this fish. It tasted quite dry, so I'd recommend dipping it in the seasoned vinegar served with the fish. Overall, just a typical pan-fried fish and nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion. The good part is that it was deboned, making it easy to eat. 

4) Seafood Noodles ($15) - This dish was super disappointing. The noodles were extremely soggy, drenched in sauce, and there wasn't much toppings (I recall having one tiny shrimp per person, plus a bit of chopped up assorted seafood). 

Overall, extremely poor service and mediocre food = 1 star for this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite Filipino Resto with amazing customer service and best owners Ate Mila and Kuya Zaldy ( Kuya Mickey with me in the picture)Must try Leche Flan, Halo-Halo, pandesal, sinigang, pinakbet!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my last review of Casa Manila. I took my parents and my brother and his fiancée there along with my girlfriend back in April 2016. Just like the last time, the service was great, staff was friendly and attentive, and the manager remembered me and my girlfriend from when we visited during Winterlicious.

The food was amazing, especially since we ordered from the actual menu this time around. We ordered a ton of food, too many to remember and list but off the the top of my head, I know there was lechon kawali, bistek, sisig, beef bulalo, Filipino Ceviche, and halo halo.

The food that came out was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. My father, who's Filipino cooking I would consider to be one of the best, was also happy with the food.

The price was also fair. It may not be the cheapest when you consider that you can go to \"Little Manila\" and get the same food for a couple of dollars (literally it's a difference of $2-$3 dollars) cheaper. You're going to a place with a much better ambiance and really good service cooked with food with locally sourced ingredients. I don't mind paying the extra $$$ for good quality and service.

Highly recommend this place especially if you want to introduce non-Filipino friends to Filipino cuisines."}
{"text":"Their festive Filipino flavours brings a lot of fun to dining out. Tasteful, exciting and healthy dishes that are must haves. 
I believe that CASA manila has crossed over to all ages and ethnicity, not just to Filipinos and Canadians. 
I would recommend this place to all my family, friends and guests from around the world. 

You should try their pork or chicken sisig that is served in a sizzling platter. I love their lechon kawali, bicol express, kalderetang baka and the sinigang na baboy soup.

All in all, this is such a memorable experience that has captured me in the true essence of what Filipino Fine Dining should be."}
{"text":"The food was practically perfect, but as a Filipino from California I've had Amazing Filipino food. That's why I always have to compare them with each other. This is one of the best I've had. It just isn't The best. Sadly that's one of the only reasons I don't want to give it more stars. 

The other reason is the bill added up quickly so this place was more expensive than other places I've tried. We wanted to try their calamansi mocktail and our server pushed us to try a pitcher of it. He didn't tell us that it was $20, so that was more than what we wanted to spend on drinks. I'm used to rice being free, but our garlic fried rice was $11, which feels expensive even for garlic fried rice. Also the service wasn't that great. They didn't check on us or refill our water.

Other than that the lumpia and lechon kawali were hot and fresh. The sizzling chicken sisig fries meets all the hype. The sinigang was exactly what we were craving. I would come back but order less and maybe steamed rice will be free."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Casa Manila and I have to say the experience was wonderful. As someone that works in the service industry I must say that the service couldn't be better. Our server was quite friendly, funny and very attentive as he checked on us about 7 times during peak dinner service hours. 

The decor was lovely in which you felt as though you were somewhere in the tropics almost a hawaiian like feel. They also have an outdoor patio to go with the whole tropic.

The food was excellent. It was flavorful, portioned well, fresh and presented nicely.
For food that was made to order the wait was quite reasonable as you are getting quality dishes. It definitely wouldn't have bothered me if the wait time for the food was longer. 

Best Filipino restaurant in TO. There's no other place like it!"}
{"text":"The food here is very authentic, perfect for sharing and coming in large groups. I love how the place is family owned. The prices are a bit high, especially if you come as a couple and order a few dishes (which you won't be able to finish) better to come with more people.

Good amount of parking, inside is spacious, don't have to wait for a seat.

I like all the food on the menu, it isn't anything to complain about, and don't forget to finish to halo halo for dessert!"}
{"text":"Charming, authentic, festive, Filipino restaurant in North York.  Casa Manila has an extensive menu that is great especially for the meat lovers.  The service staff is very attentive and the food arrived fast.  The noodle dishes were great for the kids.  

They have a special menu called Kamayan which you have to order 24 hours in advance.  With that menu, you pick one beef, one pork, one chicken, one seafood, one vegetable and one dessert.  Then it comes served on a very long banana left with rice.  You eat with your hands and it's quite festive when there is a large group."}
{"text":"Definitely a GEM, thank goodness Rita E. made this UYE possible.  Casa Manila did not disappoint as we walked in to a comforting while classy Filipino restaurant that has booths looking out to the street as well as a other tables suitable for larger groups.  As you walk in, there are plenty of miscellaneous newspapers, pamphlets, advertising handouts available for the Filipino community to keep up on recent news.

At the cash there's a display steam tray area for CONVENIENT take-out for a few ready-to-eat items.  The server came to write up our order on a notepad which was later on our same receipt, so if you want to write off a business meal maybe ask for neater writing or something but it won't matter because most people won't know the name of the dishes like our group except for our Rita.  

The guy staff had a Casa Manila Logo Black T-shirt and served me my Mango Juice in a can which was made in Philippines but I felt right at home because the can had Cantonese words on it too.

2 of each, I love the purchasing power of groups!

Lumpiang Shanghai which are bite-size Pork & Shrimp Spring Rolls are a nice appetizer especially if you get the right bite of spicy kick.  Inihaw Na Pusit(Grilled Squid) had that REAL grill flavour and grill marks, definitely something I look forward to next time as it was very tender.  

Sisig(Fried Minced Pork's Nose & Ear) was good because it had good flavours but make sure you get one of the CHILI pieces in every bite to give it that extra boost.  It also has a texture contrast of soft pieces as well as crispy as it was served on a hot cast iron plate.

Kare-Kare(Stew of Beef & Vege in Peanut Sauce) is much better here than my previous experience and it gave me more faith in this dish again.  It has the STRONG Peanut flavour but not as thick a sauce which makes all the difference.  

Special Halo Halo is a treat as you MIX MIX various Fruits, Leche Flan, Beans, Purple Yam Ice Cream which all sits on top of Shaved Ice.  I am glad I finally had this dessert the way it was meant for.  I've had variations of it as a drink which didn't incorporate as many ingredients as this.

Adobong Manok(Chicken in Vinegar, Soy Sauce, Bay Leaves) wasn't my favourite unfortunately maybe it just didn't seem to stand out from the rest of the other highlights of this MEAL.  Pancit Palabok(Rice Noodle in Seafood Sauce) was an intense YELLOW that Avitania called Kraft Dinner.  I believe the noodles are similar to Japchae consistency and it was A-OK."}
{"text":"I brought my Fil-Am childhood friends here last Sunday. We ordered pork sisig, garlic fried rice, lumpiang shanghai, gambas, palabok, laing, lechon kawali, & beef bulalo. Everything was soooooo good! It was so fantastic that my friends were jealous we had such an awesome Filipino restaurant in the GTA. My girlfriends are all awesome cooks & they were so enthusiastic of the food which brought back a lot of happy memories for us. Thank you Casa Manila & keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My go-to place when I'm craving for tasty and sinful dishes like chicken skin sisig and pork hock!!! must try their brown sauce. Beef soup, Tomato Garlic beef stew and garlic steam rice are delicious too.  

Most staff are friendly and funny, lovely place, will bring our friends."}
{"text":"I've noticed that Filipino cuisine tends to be underrated and underrepresented in most of the cities I've lived in (NYC, L.A., Seattle, Tampa, and San Francisco metro with the exception of Daly City). However, if all Filipino restaurants were like Casa Manila, I'd bet this tasty cuisine would gain more prominence in foodie culture! 

Like fellow Yelpers Wayne C and Chris P, I came here as part of Rita E's UYE on Saturday night. She did a great job of ordering a wide range of dishes to try. The biggest standout, for me, was the sisig, a sizzling dish made of minced pork. I loved the crunchy texture and savory-sweet flavor. My favorite Filipino dish, chicken adobo, was well executed here as well -- mild, slightly sweet, homey, stewy. 

The halo-halo (a dessert made with shaved ice, condensed milk, and assorted sweetened gelatins, beans and fruit) was good, but I prefer mine with a little more shaved ice so it doesn't get as soupy towards the end. 

The service and decor were really a step up from most Filipino restaurants I've been to as well. Bright white tablecloths, nice glasses, and friendly service made us feel quite at home. 

Masarap! (\"Delicious\" in Tagalog!)"}
{"text":"$14.69 for a tapsilog breakfast. Was good, but price was a tad bit steep. Especially since I checked the breakfast menu prior to coming and realized they increased their price from the original $11.00."}
{"text":"While this was a great place to walk in on for dinner, with delicious Filipino food to choose and order, experience outside of it hasn't been the greatest. I have contacted them via their online form and by phone to inquire about booking an event, but no one has gotten back to me yet. It has been a week! This only makes me wonder how their catering service must be if the business is not organized enough to get back to a potential booking customer (ie. someone who will probably spend a lot of money)."}
{"text":"Went here two times with a Filipino friend which was recommend by him. We arrived there both time about 6.30pm for dinner. The decor is a bit eclectic. There was a variety of people eating there young, old and lots of families. 

As for the service its been completely different both times:

1st time : No wait, the restaurant was a bit empty, the service was sadly really really slow. Our whole meal took over 2 hours. But the food was good

2nd time: A bit of wait and the place was packed! and the service was speedy! 

I have tried the palabok, noodles with  creamy egg like sauce, solid and what I was expecting. garlic fried rice again, solid but its hard to mess that up. Lechon, crispy pork deep fried pork belly yummy! and the best is the pork sisig - crispy pork skin with onions in a sizzling pan - it is so so good and fatty it just hits the gluttony spot! And finished off with halo-halos, a crush ice dessert with a variety of jellies and comes in a big bowl! A meal for 2 usually costs about $50 before tips."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 ppl to try the kamayan last week, also to celebrate a birthday. 5 star for service, they were nice and they sing a bday song. The kamayan tasted okay but i feel like the combo is a little monotonous. Dessert is a 1 star. Tooooo sweet."}
{"text":"Taste is quite good for Filipino cuisine. However the question is if you will get served promptly or will they wait until you starve. We waited two hours from 7:30-9:30pm. Believe it or not! Looking back, we were incredibly patient but we are never going back."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great Kamayan feast and fulfilled my hunt at Casa Manila! I decided to have my birthday dinner here based on the images on Yelp and Instagram. I tried to be as easy-going as possible because I know how annoying groups can be and event planning. Boy, was I the complete opposite! I had so many changes, questions, concerns from booking two weeks in advance until the food arrived at the table. Casa Manila was SO ACCOMMODATIVE throughout the entire process! Great service from an amazing team! I honestly changed my group size, menu choices, dessert and cakes at least 10 times, I even called the day of for 5 cancellations (15 to 10 people due to the snow). Not once did the staff give me attitude or refuse my dinner party. I am very appreciative of their kindness! 
Now onto the dining experience. I have no idea what the ambiance is like a whimsical, old Philippines vibe with some cultural pieces and dream catchers. They serve water cups in coconut shells and make you feel like you've arrived in a tropical paradise. I picked the regular kamayan feast and chose deep fried pork belly, coconut squash & long beans, bbq chicken skewers, and fried chicken wings. They have got to have the most crispy, flavourful fried chicken in the city!!! (Who would've thought?!) it was all served on a bed of garlic rice and plated on banana leaves. The dinner was so indulgent and delicious. My mouth is watering just writing this review hoping I can savour this meal again.
I also ordered pitchers of pineapple mojito which complemented the dinner so well. My friends and I would come back for these too.
And you even get a dessert, I chose the ice cream option so my friends were so able to chose their own flavour. So many exotic options like cheese corn, UBE, lychee, mango and green tea. Overall a very filling dinner!
I even ordered a whole UBE cake to celebrate and it was super light, fluffy and not too sweet. UBE is one of my favourite flavours so it just iced the cupcake on this place!
 I urge you all to come to Casa Manila and try the Kamayan feast there's many other options of meats and you're bound to find something you like. It's also only 29.99 a person and you really get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening for their Summerlicious dinner and walked out with no regrets. I ordered the pork skewers, chicken sisig, and ube cake. The main was a really good portion with a lot of chicken. Although the food came out quite slow as they were quite busy, but the service was great that day. I'd definitely return to try their kamayan experience !"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at CASA manila. I had gone with a group of 16 for a birthday, so we did the Kamayan feast. 

We made reservations prior for 12 people and sent an email saying we had changed it to 16. They replied back right away saying okay, but when we got there they some how said that they didn't make the changes and made a huge fuss about it. They weren't very accommodating even though we had email proof that they responded to our revised number of people. 

After some time they finally figured out a way to fit our 4 extra people. We ordered drinks and there was a bit of a mix up with between the servers. Over the service was not very pleasant and there were so many miscommunications. 

Food however is good as always. It starts off with soup for the table and crispy chicken skin, followed by the Kamayan feast. We chose:

BBQ Chicken Skewers
Coconut Adobo Beef
Grilled Pork Belly 
Jumbo Garlic Prawns
Peanut Vegetable Stew 
Ice Cream

The flavours of all our choices were delicious and the meats were all very tender. My favourite was the chicken and the pork belly and the vegetables. The peanut sauce in the veggie stew went nicely with the rice. Overall the food was delicious, fresh and very flavourful. It's a lot of food even for big eaters its definitely enough. Rice is unlimited but they give you so much rice already its a lot to finish. Nothing is super spicy so its suitable for everyone. 

Don't expect amazing service, but the experience of eating a Kamayan feast is fun and delicious, so worth a shot."}
{"text":"Five of us dined here last Friday and overall we found the food pretty average. Some hits and misses among the dishes...

Kare kare - peanut beef stew. It looks and sounds rich but the sauce doesn't have a lot of flavour. I appreciate the fact that everything was low sodium but I expected more beef taste and peanut taste in the sauce. The shrimp paste made it much better but still wasn't great. Beef is fall off the bones tender though.

Manila chicken curry - tender chicken, good sauce, lovely vegetables - one of my favourite dishes and taste a lot like Malaysian style curry. But not a dish you can't get elsewhere...

Pinkabet - lovely vegetable dish with delightful pieces of pork inside. The pork is delcious.

Daing na Bangus - panfried milk fish. This was pretty good. 

Pancit Malaboon - thick rice noodle in seafood sauce. From the photos (golden coloured) and description this looks like a wonderful dish, but really not a lot of seafood flavour in the dish or any other noticable flavour, it seems like it was seasoned maybe with fish sauce? That was all the seafood taste I got.  We didn't finish this.

Perhaps if I tried other dishes I'd get a better overall experience, or perhaps my expectations is different, but I feel that I do enjoy Restauran Malay or Saigon Star a lot more for the same price."}
{"text":"I'm Filipino and have eaten some amazing home-cooked meals my whole life. The food here? Brings back memories of my Lola and her amazing food. The flavours are authentic and some had a modern twist - the chicken chichirron were my favourite! My first kamayan! What an amazing experience. I'm definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Cool experience!

GREAT food, TERRIBLE service!

I had never had Filipino food before, so wasn't sure what to expect... I think I thought it would be Thai-ish with more mango and pineapple and stuff... and I had heard about pastries... anyway, my mind was open and my tummy was empty!

The decor is awesome - Tikki-like... leaves and bamboo and such - felt much more tropical than your average North York eatery!

To note: 
1. I am a vegetarian.
2. We had one in our party well-versed in the cuisine, which was very helpful in deciphering the menu.

We arrived, someone came and sat us, and unfortunately the service nightmare began there. I won't go on and on, but that's why they lost two stars. There were 3-4 staff members we saw, but it was still 15 minutes after arrival before someone even asked us if we wanted something to drink... Speaking of which, the cocktails were a nightmare too. Syrupy mixes. Ick. There was a language barrier, for sure, but our waitress had no idea what I was trying to order even when I pointed it out on the menu. I guess not many people drink here?? Anyway, the food also took an extremely long time to arrive, as did the bill. But, the food was AMAZING. Strange mix of incredible food and terrible service!

Here is what we ordered:
- Veg Spring Rolls (Lumpia Prito) 
- Chicken Spring Rolls (Lumpiang Shanghai)
- Java Rice 
- Garlic Chicken
- Pancit Canton (veg. version)
- Pork dish (oops I can't remember... but it was eaten up very quickly!)

We all gorged ourselves. It was soooo delicious! And it was only lunch. We rolled out the door.

SO... I am told this is very close to home-cooking in Filipino families, and I love it. The food is so tasty - not as \"clean\" tasting as Japanese and not as heavy as Chinese (Westernized Chinese food, I suppose). A nice change of flavours. 

I will try Filipino food again, and maybe I'll try Casa Manila again, but only if it's Take Out!"}
{"text":"First time having Filipino food and I must say I like it! But you can get quickly out-of-shape if you're eating it on a daily basis :p
Casa Manila is a popular Filipino restaurant that's serving all your traditional bites!
The ambiance is beautiful, resembling the tropics of the country in addition if you're attentive to details, each fixture represent the cultural aspects of the country: some Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, etc.

Our group experience was extraordinary, the service is warm and welcoming and over all environment was clean and presentable.

For starters we had their traditional beef soup cooked in a delicious stock.....all leading up to the show stopper.

THE Kamayan dish was fantastic, squid, lechon pork, curry chicken, beef brisket, vegetables and rice. Portions are sufficient, presentation was superb, hell even the roaring drums as they bring the dish out. 

Halo halo was a delight, colourful melody of ice cream, shaved ice, preserved fruits and jelly. It somewhat reminded me of the traditional Taiwanese shaved ice and ice cream desserts. Overall Casablanca Manila was a delightful experience and personable one. We had the opportunity to meet the owner who was so down to earth."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Phillipine Cuisine and also my first time dining at Casa Manila. 

I was there to meet a few old friends and we had made prior reservations around 3pm on Saturday. 

The decor looks like you're eating at someone's home.
It felt very comfortable and inviting. 

I had the Adobo chicken with garlic rice, a mango salad and a bottle of San Miguel beer. 

Portions were great. I shared my mango salad with 4 people. 

The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.

What I didn't like, was that I was standing at the door waiting for attention from one of the 5 employees, who made eye contact a few times before one eventually (after about 10 minutes) sat me at our reserved table. 

This was very awkward as there's no sign indicating whether it's \"seat yourself\" or \"please wait to be seated\". 

The other thing was that it was quite difficult to not only get the attention of our server but for her to remember a few things (for example one of my friends ordered a bottle of water and a take-out box) which he later had to re-order. 

I ended up paying around $35 for my meal after a 15% gratuity. 

All in all great experience."}
{"text":"Loved the pork adobo slider.  It's tasty.  The owner was nice and very knowledgeable.  If I'm visiting Toronto again soon, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"i never knew philipino food can be this delicious ! first time ive ever had philipino food was at jesse jr's in scarborough . it was nothing special, just food to fill up the tummy . but food at casa manila is amazing ! not just any food to fill up the hunger, it makes my tastebuds happy !

my favorite thing to eat here is kare kare with garlic rice . YUM . and the special halo halo dessert ! must tries !!! my bf loved the crispy pata (pork knuckle), even a wee bit more than lechon kawali (pork belly). this was our first time here . we were the only ones in the restaurant, near the closing time . the guy who was there who seemed like the owner was really sweet and went through the menu with us and made these recommendations . they didn't make us feel rushed at all . both food & the atmospheres of the place made it feel very homey . it became one of my favorite places to eat in toronto . 

our second visit wasn't as good as our first . this time, we tried the inihaw na bangus (milkfish) and java rice . there was a big group of party that night so service was extremely slow but it expected . the food however, was a disappointment . :( fish was way too dry for my liking & the bf said there was certain smell to it that he couldnt get past (and hes never a picky eater). there was also smell on the rice as if it were about to go bad . lechon kawali (fried pork belly) was amazingg tho . for dessert, we decided to try turon, which i kicked myself for not getting the halo halo instead . 

i'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars . owner is extremely patient & nice and the food on most part, is flavorful, homey & so very delicious . try kare kare with garlic rice & special halo halo if you do go !"}
{"text":"A pretty cool place for filipino food.  While the food is relatively expensive for the portion size, I mean what can you expect?  Pretty packed when I came with my girlfriend as it was during the summerlicious season (Also, I believe it is usually packed even without the offer), but overall the dining experience was not too shabby.  Due to the amount of people though, service was a bit sub-par, but hey, it is not a fine dining experience so you should not expect top tier service when you are really there to experience the food and culture.  Overall, food was really good and while there could have been some improvements to the service, I have no complaints and will still go every so often to satisfy a cultural cuisine that is not found in too many places here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow I was very impressed and satisfied with my lunch at Casa Manila today!

A friend brought a group of us here for winterlicious and we decided to order family style instead.

Some of my favourite dishes: 
White Fish - this was by far my favourite! Lightly friend fish 
Abodo Chicken - slightly tamarind tangy and amazing.
Pancit noodles (with seafood) - a must. Light and tasty, great accompaniment to your meal.
Chicken arroz caldo - chicken soup which was great.
Laing - vegetarian dish made of coconut milk and taro leaves, also very good. 

If you feel like Filipino food, Casa Manila is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Wow. Probably some of the best tasting food I've had in a long, long time. Asian food with some unique and stand out twists. The crunch pork sisig has a great mouth feel and mixes well with white rice. The Filipino spring rolls are delights. The kare kare reminds one of a sweet peanut pad thai but without all the bothersome parts.  

The halo halo for dessert was another surprise. Similar to Korean patbingsoo but with a great purple yam ice cream in the center. We have so few purple foods and it's nice to see one."}
{"text":"Will definitely be a returning customer! Ambience is perfect. Nothing like Apo Hiking Society playing in the background setting  the mood for what's to come...

Sisig fries = perfect fusion! Lechon Kawali was good. As a Sinigang fanboy growing up, it didn't disappoint. Lumpia was nice/crispy. Bangus was good. Buko pandan was on point.

Forgot to take other pics just got lost in the moment. Service was nice/friendly. No-brainer 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant twice before. The service and food is impeccable. I recommend getting a booth though."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious 2018 with my friend on the very last day. We managed to make online reservations the night before which was very quick and easy. When we got to the restaurant, it was almost empty.

The food tasted absolutely amazing! they all had very refreshing flavors, especially with the abundance of citrus fruit that made the heavier food a lot better to eat. We also got a side order of halo halo, which tasted delicious but it also melted quite quickly.

What I like the most about this restaurant was that the food came in exactly at the right time. The service was very attentive and the restaurant was very clean. I highly recommend coming here if you haven't tried filipino food!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Perfect balance in ambiance, good, tasty and healthy food and price. I will definitely comeback."}
{"text":"Outstanding place and food. Over the top a must try foe anyone looking for good food."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is. It was my 6th or 7th time there and it keeps getting better and better. KAMAYAN style...try it...so amazing.  The chicken soup is the best I have had in my 44 years....The owners are gracious and accommodating. ..definitely has my patronage.  Always full and satisfied when I leave."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, it feels very vibrant and cultural. From the chairs to the utensils to the banana leaf table covering - very unique. My girlfriends and I came here for the kamayan - we did not do premium. More than 4 girls can finish. Kamayan is a good experience, but I wouldnt do it every time.  I think I would rather order regular dishes next time. I thought the food was a little bland, I was dipping everything in the fermented shrimp sauce (bagoong). The garlic rice didnt really taste as garlicky as it did when I ate at Lamesa. I felt the kare kare could have used more peanut flavouring. It was also very difficult for me to use just my hands to eat. Im so use to only eating with my thumb and forefinger when eating with my hands, but my girlfriends just let loose and went ham hahaa. All the other dishes that went out to the other tables looked really good. We had calamansi mohitos pitchers x2 (very good)...and of course halo halo for dessert - which again, is way more than 4 girls can finish. Overall, a new interesting eating experience - would recommend if youve never had kamayan before."}
{"text":"Their lunch is really good.  You order the food like a food court and grab a seat.  You get a rice or noodles with choice of 2 or 3 items, whatever they have available for the day.  All of them are always really good.  They make it fresh every morning.  We sometime order the. Lechon Kawali on the side.  Always really crispy but only get this at lunch.  Their dinner is not always as good.  It's usually the same food but left all day.  They are real Filipino food.   The restaurant is always clean.  They give a good portion and you won't leave there hungry."}
{"text":"Went here for a Valentine's Day kamayan lunch with my family. The place is beautiful but one of the worst service I have ever had. The food wasn't too bad, but it took an hour for them to prepare the kamayan meal which came out cold. If the reservation was known from time couldn't they have planned accordingly? Especially on Valentine's Day? We waited exactly one hour for our meal, the waiter or assistant manager did not even check once for the duration of our entire meal how the food was. We complained that it was taking so long for our food and the assistant manager kept saying \"soon\". It was unacceptable that the food that we waited for, for an hour came out cold. On top of that two of the four jumbo shrimp that came with the kamayan meal was completely raw. After our meal, when we called someone to assist us, several times, we informed the waiter who called the assistant manager about our raw shrimp. The assistant manager then came, and asked us why we didn't complain earlier so they could give us new shrimp and I explained that no one came. She rolled her eyes and said sorry and asked us what we want done. I told her I didn't want shrimp I just wanted to let them know I was upset that 1. We waited an hour for our food to arrive and 2. The food didn't even come out right. For $75 per person (it was a party of four) and for only a satisfactory amount of food, and the terrible service we got especially from the assistant manager, we definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Has a homey feel to the restaurant, also like you're taken to a different country. 

Ordered the pork sisig and chicken adobo as per yelp users' and waiter's recommendations. Got garlic rice on the side and the halohalo dessert. I came with great expectations. 

The sisig definitely different. Smelled great, awesome crunch, like tiny clumps of fatty bacon goodness sizzling away. But I think a few spoonfuls should have been where I stopped eating it. It became too greasy for me. I ended up just tasting grease and not the meat. 

The first bite of the adobo chicken was so flavorful but after a piece, the chicken just tasted very salty. It reminded me of an overly salty Chinese soy braised chicken. It was unfortunately on the drier side as well. Ended up gulping lots water. 

Garlic rice was awesome. They don't skimp on the garlic in their dishes! 

Loved the halo halo dessert. Love anything taro and  coconut. Loved the different textures in the dessert. 

Overall, it was around a 3.5/5 experience but the menu is extensive, the only decent Philippino restaurant relatively nearby, and their lunch special deals and weekend breakfast look so appealing. So will definitely return to give it at least another try."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I am back in the Philippines!!! I will go back here when I visit Toronto again. I ordered garlic fried rice, sinigang, pancit, lumpia, and pork belly because... Pinoy :-). The decor was very nice! Price was fair except for the ceviche-like  dish that my uncle ordered, too expensive! Great staff, as expected :-)"}
{"text":"I don't know what makes this place exceptional: warm service or the food. I am just glad I came here. Try the sizzling sisig, the lechon kawali, manila chicken curry...try everything"}
{"text":"The food tastes incredibly great. Especially the icecream, I think tastes even better. Full star for sure. Highly recommend to drink different kinds of drink in the restaurant as well. Unique experience definitely should marks at foodies ' must-try lists."}
{"text":"We had a great UYE here last night.  After perusing the menu we all decided to leave the ordering up to Rita E's expertise.  She ordered a pork, a chicken, a beef, two fish, and a seafood dish.  Don't ask me to even try to remember the names of the dishes.

My favorite dish of the night was the stewed pork and veggies in a peanut sauce.  The pork fell apart on your fork it was so tender.  My second favorite was the chicken dish (aribato?).

Overall a great experience.  I would probably come here more often if it wasn't so far north of Bloor."}
{"text":"Two words... BABY SQUID! My favourite dish here! This consists of small baby squads deep friend in batter and each little squid has its eggs intact inside adding so much flavour to each bite! Their halo halo is pretty bomb too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant takes me back to the Philippines with their traditional decor and the friendly staff! The food is hella bomb dignity too! 

Obviously you have to try their pork and chicken sisig, their bbq dishes and crispy fried dishes! 

On Wednesday's they have paint night! They have someone teach you how to paint a picture and you can order alcoholic beverages and an app. I obviously tried the calamansi mojito and chicken chicharon! Mmm

Great food, staff, and Wednesday paint night! I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Being Filipino myself, I really like to support the Filipino businesses and hope they do well. But this one is a little hard since I really didn't have a great time in this restaurant. The place is pricey for the amount of food you receive but I was banking for some great tasting food.

The servers were really polite and kind. They got us a table and water right away. I can't say the same thing about the food. Filipino can't eat their meal without rice, in this situation we've got all out food except our meal except our rice. So at this point no one has eaten and by the time we received our rice, the food was cold and not fresh. To top it off we haven't received all our food and I had to personally get up and remind them that we were still missing our palabok. Not a good impression I don't think.

Food rating: the quality is ok, nothing to die for or leaving a lasting impression. I guess being Filipino I had high standards. In general, the meal can be a little bit more flavorful and presented a little better. One of our orders were lumpia sariwa was for 9 dollars for vegetables and a pita. I'm sorry but I would not pay for that. And 2 dollars for hot green tea and we got warm green tea and 2 cold glasses. Just unacceptable. 

Service quality: under staff! They can't keep up with the amount of customers which leads to long wait time. Long amount time where we waited anxiously for some service.

Final verdict: I think this restaurant has potential to be good. Lots of areas that need improvement. Will be back for second chance. 

PS I hope this place also improves their prices on desserts. Can't charge 10 dollars for 1 spoonful of lecheflan."}
{"text":"We were looking for something a little off the beaten path for a Summerlicious meal when we stumbled upon the entry for Casa Manila.

We made a reservation for 7:00 on a Saturday night and the place was pretty much packed when we arrived. We were shown to a comfy booth and I decided to order the following:

Filipino Beef Vegetable Soup | Beef Nilaga (\"Beef, carrots and vegetables in a beef broth soup made with beef bones and fresh vegetables\"): This is a very brothy soup that's not quite as simple as it initially appears. Though I had to remove a piece of meat that was 90% fat, the soup is rich in flavor and I especially dug the undercurrent of burnt garlic.

Crispy Pork Belly | Lechon Kawali (\"A Filipino iconic favourite - pork belly pan-fried to a crispy skin and softly marbled meat served with the house-made lechon sauce and seasoned vinegar; accompanied with garlic rice and coconut ginger vegetables\"): This might just be the crispiest pork belly I've ever had. It's a very good dish. The pork belly, which unfortunately didn't arrive to the table hot, is accompanied by a pair of stellar sides, with the garlic rice perfectly prepared and the vegetables soaked in an absolutely irresistible coconut ginger sauce.

Cassava Cake with Custard Topping (\"A delectable dessert made with coconut milk and topped with custard\"): This was undoubtedly the weakest dish of the night. It's a competent yet fairly boring dessert that doesn't boast any standout flavors. I sampled my dining companion's Ube Cake, and that seemed much, much better.

I would definitely return to Casa Manila to try some of their other offerings, though its suburban location makes that highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Tried their summerlicious, $28, absolutely  not worth  it, food very bland  and small  portion  as well."}
{"text":"My Order: 2 1/2 portions Kare Kare (mediocre) & Chicken Adobo (lovely).

Pros:
- comes w/ plaza parking lot 
- the food was very flavorful; I came on a weekday lunch & their lunch specials are reasonably priced ($8)
- I loved that I had the option of getting 2 half portions at no extra charge; this allowed me to try two diff meals in one! 
- very lovely decor & ambiance; it felt like I was in a different country/environment entirely

Cons:
- the dinner menu/specialty price fixe menu seems very overpriced (easily $20+) for the same food you can get for lunch

Overall, it was a very exquisite fine dining experience. If you're dining in the evening, there is a \"check in\" special w/ Yelp. You'll get a free dessert if you order a regular priced entree :) bon appetit~"}
{"text":"They say you can't beat home-cooked Filipino food. And it's true. My mother would kill me if I said otherwise.

But Casa Manila is now my go-to Filipino Restaurant in Toronto. Feels.  Like.  Home.

I came here alone. And typically... you wouldn't want to go to a fine Filipino restaurant to eat alone. The portions are just too large, and a meal wouldn't be complete if I didn't have a little bit of everything... so I ordered a little bit of everything. I am not ashamed to sit alone in a booth with 5 plates in front of me. I believe in the power of tupperware. Best believe that my hotel fridge is now stocked. 

To me: The mark of an excellent Filipino restaurant is in one dish. And one dish alone. 

SISIG. (Pronounced: SEE-sig)

That chopped up pork is the first thing I look for on any Filipino menu. And it earns high marks. The sisig came out on a sizzling platter. Spicy. Savory. Salty. Seasoned. Superb. 4 stars. (WHAT?! not 5?) I know folks... it was unfortunately a little dry and a little overcooked... maybe next time...

I also ordered the pancit palabok (pronounced pahn-sit pah-lah-bowk) which came with shrimp & squid. I've never had squid in my palabok... but it was goooooood. And it even had chicharon (krispy pork rind) sprinkled on top. So many flavors and textures. Delicious.

The lumpia shanghai was aight. Nothing spectacular there. Just glad that it wasn't over-cooked or burned. I could almost swear that these are the same prepackaged ones I used to buy from the store... but... who knows.

I ended the evening with my favorite dessert: Halo-Halo. (pronounced Hah-loh, not Hay-low and it means Mix-Mix) A mixture of delectable tropical goodies: fruits, jellies, jams, & flan, with shaved ice, condensed milk, and your choice of ice cream. I'm rather partial to ube (pronounced oo-beh, meaning purple yam) ice cream. If you've never had it, it's usually served in a tall sundae glass and in layers like a parfait. At Casa Manila, it was served in a bowl and each ingredient was separated. Now you get to have some fun and mix all the ingredients together... hence mix-mix. It's not a complete meal without some kind of Filipino dessert. Halo-halo is it for me. 

To drink, I ordered the Gulaman Sago which is the Filipino version of bubble tea... but better. Hehe. The website says it's a \"grass jelly drink\" but idk wtf that means. If you read \"grass jelly\", are you really gonna order it? Probably not. So disregard \"grass\" and just read \"jelly\". To put it plain: It's a caramelized-sugar drink with jello and tapioca pearls. And it's so refreshing.

--------------
I now realize how long my review is getting, and I suppose the reason for this is because of the severe LACK of Filipino restaurants in Toronto. Didn't mean for it to turn into a lesson in filipino foods and tagalog pronounciations, but it did. I would love to organize a UYE or something to share my culture with Toronto's Yelp Community. 
--------------

Needless to say, I had a great time at Casa. The owners were attentive & we even had a conversation about Filipino restaurants back home. It wasn't a very busy night, which probably afforded me that opportunity.

Ah... home away from home. I like Casa."}
{"text":"I came there on a Saturday night hoping to share the Filipino food experience with my boyfriend. I was greeted by the the hostess who asked if I had a reservation. The place looked busy.

 I replied \"No.\"

The hostess looked at her watch and rudely replied how busy they were and that I should have made a reservation, placing the blame on me. 

I was so appalled by the customer service I received. You do not talk that way to customers.
You apologize. You tell them kindly that there are currently no tables available. You explain to them the possible wait time they will be looking at. And you kindly encourage them to make a reservation in the future and again apologize for any inconvenience.

The owner should train their staff better. 

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. 

My first five minutes at the restaurant wasn't a good sign, crowded entrance with no host in sight. Had to chase down a staff member to let them know I had a reservation. Got seated shortly after, but my friend and I sat for AN HOUR AND A HALF before we got a waitress and two waters (after the table next to us kindly pointed out to the waitress that we had arrived before them). All the patrons in our section were complaining and it was obvious we (6 tables) were forgotten. 

Ordered lumpia, adobo chicken, and pork sisig. Lumpia came out about 40 mins after we ordered. Fortunately, chicken & pork came out a few minutes after. However, the pork sisig was missing the egg we added so we sent it back. Finished our meal of lumpia and chicken, still no pork sisig (and all they had to do was literally crack an egg on top, since it comes raw on the sizzling plate). Lumpia was decent, but chicken adobo was very good! Authentic & super tender! 

Pork sisig finally comes out about 20 mins after we finish our meal (and another gentle reminder to the waitress). It is completely overcooked after sitting untouched on the hot plate for so long, waiting to be topped off with an egg. 

We then have to remind two different waitresses for the dessert we ordered (halo halo & ube cake) During our entire meal, we actually had rotating waitresses. However, no matter which waitress, it seemed they would have immediate amnesia. After another 40 mins we finally get our halo halo. We finished that up (and it's HUGE!), and still no cake. We get it about 20 minutes later after asking the owner who walked by to check on us.  Desserts were delicious. 

We ask for the bill & get it 30 mins later. Glad we didn't have any real evening plans after dinner."}
{"text":"It really hurts writing this review, because I am Filipino, but this place is disappointing on so many levels. I used to come here a couple years ago when they had the original chef or owners?, but the quality of food and service has changed. 

My boyfriend purchased a Groupon deal and we decided to use it before it expired. The restaurant was surprisingly busy, but we were seated right away. We ordered garlic chicken (adobo), lechon kawali and a bowl of rice. 

It took very long for our food. We waited about 20 minutes and only the chicken adobo arrived with rice. The \"sharing\" portion could only be good for maybe two people, so it's not large enough to share with a group. The dish itself was VERY salty, and I know exactly how chicken adobo should taste like. All I could taste was corn starch and salt in the sauce. There was no balance of vinegar and soy sauce in the dish. We decided to save our rice and wait for the lechon.

We waited so long for our lechon kawali that our server actually asked us if we were done with our plates! We told her we're waiting for lechon and she asked, \"you didn't get it yet?\" Obviously not, if it's not our table! It arrived shortly after, and our server apologized and said that she would fill up our water glasses right away...and she never did for the remainder of our meal. 

The lechon kawali was very good. Crispy and generous, no complaints with the dish itself. However we noticed staff were clearing tables, but piling dirty dishes  on a empty table behind us. They weren't even brought to the kitchen. We also noticed that other patrons were helping themselves to pitchers of water. We never got asked how our meal was or had our water refilled. The staff was too busy serving new customers at the expense of not attending existing ones. 

To top it all off, when I tried to pay with my credit card, the waitress told me that they were fixing the POS machine and they she'll bring it over. After waiting 10 minutes again, I went to the cash to pay and they were all trying to fix the machine (it didn't print receipts). I paid with my credit card and after it said \"Approved\", with no receipt printed, the waitress tried to charge my card again, claiming the transaction was lost......

Sigh...I really, really wanted to like this place but I won't be coming back here. If you want filipino food without the pretentious presentation and pricing, don't come here."}
{"text":"Service was on point! I've gotten take out from here quite a numerous times but I have to say eating at the restaurant is what makes this place stand out. I came here on a Saturday night with a friend who's never had Filipino food before. It was jaaaam packed. We waited about 15 minutes for a table for two. There was tons of big parties of 8 or more who ordered the kamayan which looked bomb. Since it was just the two of us, we ordered individual items:

- pork lumpia (recommend)
- chicken and pork adobo 
- pancit bihon (recommend)
- coconut green beans
- halo halo (recommend, share one for two people) 

There was quite a few people's birthdays so they would come out singing happy birthday with a huge halo halo or cake, it was super sweet and added a great touch to our eating experience. Having been to the Philippines, I wouldn't say the food here is anywhere as good (the pancit bihon missed that hint of calamansi). The food itself was good overall, nothing tasted bad but nothing was super mind blowing either ...ALTHOUGH I would definitely come back for the halo halo since I personally haven't had it anywhere else in Toronto. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The owners are amazing! Love the quality of food and selection! The decor provides a great atmosphere as well! I've been here a number of times with my husband and family. My go to place for Filipino food!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was very poor, and dining area was chilly making it an unpleasant dining experience. Wearing my jacket and scarf during dinner shouldn't be necessary, especially in early October!"}
{"text":"Casa Manila is an amazing place when it comes to authentic and tasty Filipino cuisine. 

My favorite Filipino dish is the fried Milkfish and theirs is simply amazing! It is fried to perfection and absolutely delicious. I also love Filipino garlic rice and that was great too. Their vegetarian lumpia are seasoned well and have a great mix of vegetables inside them. Very crispy as well!

The service was quick and friendly. 

The Halo Halo is to die for. 

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cool experience for a friend's birthday but I found the food extremely bland and not flavourful. I haven't had authentic Filipino food before so it's hard for me to baseline. The food came on a super long leaf and was spread all across. With plain white rice as the base, there was an assortment of meat spread across. There was short ribs, chicken, pork and such. I found all the meat not flavourful, sometimes dry and just plain all over. I had a lot of fun eating with my hands. Dessert were these giant pots of sweat stuff (fruit, icecream, and such).

I'd probably won't visit again but you could try for the experience."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice plus the music is awesome. Feels like you're in the Philippines. Ordered the dinner combo, crispy pata, daing na bangus (milk fish) and pinakbet. The crispy pata is a little bit tough so we end up packing it up for to go. The daing na fish needs a little bit more seasoning. The pinakbet is spot on. The combo dinner is for 2-4 persons.

Ordered the halo-halo @ $11. It was pricey but it was good. It was cold when we went there so we end up sharing the halo halo just like what we saw in the other table. It comes with small bowl. 

They have kamayan, eating hand-to-mouth, which we might try when we go back."}
{"text":"My first time trying Filipino food and let me say the experience has completely turned me off to ever try Filipino food again
We went in on about 4pm and we were the only customers....decor is nice inside so I was expecting something good...we wanted to share something so the waiter suggested the chicken abode and garlic fried rice, I also got the ube smoothie

First off our waiter didnt give a crap about us even though there was no one in the restaurant....they were rather busy setting up a party and didn't even offer to get us water for a while....second of all we waited 25mins for our food when there was no one in he restaurant....we had to call him to check on our food in order for him to fetch our food which came out kind of cold....pathetic 

The chicken abode was salty as hell and dry, it was literally drenched in soy sauce and gravy......eating that whole dish would have probably given me high blood pressure...the garlic fried rice was overpriced, $6 for rice in garlic.....I'm sorry casa Manila but you guys clearly didn't give a crap about us so I will never come back again"}
{"text":"I consulted with my filipino hubby on this rating and he agreed that this is a solid four.

I've actually been here twice - once last year, and just last weekend and I have to say I found the 2nd time much better than I remembered. I think the decor was more inviting this time - with a nice warm brown lattice on the ceiling and lanterns and decor taken from a southeast asian gift shop. 

We ordered: bicol express, sinigang, sisig, daing (fried milkfish) all with garlic rice. We had sapin sapin for dessert.

I enjoyed all dishes and they got the authentic seal of approval from filipino hubby. I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size and amount of meat and vegetables in each stew - we would've been full with just 2 of those dishes! But we don't go uptown very often and wanted to try everything!

The only negative things:
- our sisig came on a \"sizzling\" platter but it wasn't actually sizzling. It makes me wonder if they took it from the buffet for the 50th anniversary dinner they were hosting that night. Other patrons that ordered that same dish had their dish sizzling - I was disappointed in the inconsistency with our dish
- the washrooms are super cold! brrr...

All in all, a solid choice if you are looking for filipino food in Toronto and definitely one of the more upscale filipino restaurants I've been to (the others were mainly take-out or in a bar)."}
{"text":"I used to have a Filipino friend when I was younger so I was over a lot for dinner at his place.  His mom would whip up some amazing dishes everytime I went.  To this day, it's been pretty hard to find a place that would remind me of her cooking.  Casa Manila is pretty much the closest I've gotten at this point.  If you like Filipino food, you should give thisd place a try.

Pros:  
Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  
Dishes are made fresh (according to staff)
Portions are pretty good

Cons:
Because dishes are prepared fresh, it can take a while.

I mentioned I've had a lot of filipino food when I was younger, but have no idea what each dish was actually called.  The staff was able to help us out with items that weren't pictured in the menu.  They knew exactly what ingredients were going in and how it was prepared.  Really helps when you're trying cuisine you're not farmiliar with.

We had the Bicol Express, Kare Kare, Kalderetang Baka, and the Lechon Kawali.  All dishes were prepared very well.  The taste was wonderful and like I said, reminded me of all the home cooked filipino meals I had when I was younger.  

My only gripe was the wait time for the food.  It was almost a good 20 minutes before anything was brought out.  This was due to every dish being freshly prepared.  You can take this as either a good or a bad thing depending on how hungry you are when you get there.  Next time, I will defeinitely go when I'm just about to get hungry."}
{"text":"Toronto is supposedly the mecca of Hongkong/Cantonese cuisine for those of us not living in HK. Perhaps if Toronto had more places like Casa Manila, people would say that Toronto is also a destination for Filipino food. 

Palabok with shrimp and calamari? Check.
Lechon with crispy, candy like skin? Check.
KIlawin? Check.
Paella? Check.
Homemade-style lumpiang sariwa? Check.

Top it all off with the buko pandan and sapin-sapin. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have really mixed feelings about Casa Manila. I think their food is beautiful, but my overall experience left us disappointed.
I did Kamayan for my bf's birthday as a party of 13. I prearranged the event with the restaurant and they were accommodating and helpful. I had to make changes since I wasn't fully aware of allergies and headcount, the restaurant said it's fine since it was 24hrs+ ahead.
Upon our arrival, a table was prepared with banana leaf and coconut cups - tropical with delicious food smells in the air. After the majority of the party arrived, no one helped us. We had to ask a server before we were greeted. He confirmed the wrong headcount & menu and we didn't get water until we were seated for 30mins (I chased over 4x).
Service continues to be a huge miss, failing in all areas - from ignoring requests, forgetfulness, wrong food, splitting the bill wrong, bringing out dessert and singing Happy Birthday WITHOUT THE CAKE we brought and told them a week in advance.
Our drinks were also overpriced and unsatisfactory. We got coconut dream w/ alcohol. Booze was too strong and didn't work with the creamy coconut, it was so bad out table couldn't finish a pitcher. The virgin pineapple mojito was tasty except we found an elastic band in our pitcher.
Now the food is a whole different story. We got beef ribs, crispy pork belly, bbq chicken skewers, grilled squid and coconut veggies. It was all
4/5 delicious. Everyone was very impressed by the food and there were plenty of leftovers. It's quite fun and a very different. I would definitely recommend the pork and chicken.
We also noticed most other tables got great service, so I think we only got extremely horrible service since they can auto tip a whopping 20%....
Overall, I am sure I will not be returning but do recommend if you plan on buying their food for takeout."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious $18 lunch on the weekend; was able to get a last minute reservation. The restaurant surprisingly filled up quickly around noon with a lot of returning customers -- good sign!

I ordered the Casa Manila salad for my starter -- this salad was delicious - greens were fresh and crunchy, the ginger and sesame flavours were very nice and the sweetness of the tangerine slices were delicious!

For my main I got the crispy pork belly - this dish was very flavourful but my only complaint is that the pork belly was completely all fat! #dietstartstomorrow The garlic rice and coconut ginger vegetables were so yummy!

For dessert I ordered the cassava cake, which was served warm and a perfect way to end the meal.

Overall, the meal was great and the owner was very friendly. I would love to come back some time to try more Filipino foods!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the adobo chicken sliders.
I only had these for take out and I was pretty disappointed. I wanted the sandwich but I guess they only do that for lunch (??)
It's 2 smallish sliders for $6 
And there isn't too much in there

The big negative is that there were small bones in our sandwiches. Each bite, I had to take out a small chicken bone. Really disappointed with that.
The service was good - waiter was nice and offered water when I came to pick up our order.

Be careful with the adobo chicken sliders"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Filipino food for the most part is a newer venture into international cuisine for me.

We were a group of 5 and had ordered a number of items on the menu:
Sinangag na Kayumangging Kanin
Tinuhog Inasal Manok (Extra Spicy)
Sizzling Beef Salpicado Hot Plate
Crunchy Pork Sisig Hot Plate
Crispy Pata
Inihaw Pusit

I can't speak for the last 3 items of what we ordered, but the overall rating from our group was definitely a 10/10. 

I enjoyed the Garlic Fried Rice, with the Grilled Lemongrass Skewers, and Sizzling Beef Salpicado. The two meat dishes I tried were spicy - I asked for the Skewers to be extra spicy (it has a Piri Piri taste to it). 

Service was very fast and friendly. Overall ambience was relaxing and the company I was with said it had a reminiscent feeling to it. 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone - it's got a wide variety of options so everyone can enjoy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok...not worth the money they charge.  I was unimpressed and will not return.  I was excited to try this place and was so disappointed as my expectations were high.  Service not great and The parking is awful."}
{"text":"A small buffet style Filipino restaurant with a selection of common dishes. They tend to run out of items quickly and the. You have to wait for more to be made. It's a family run restaurant so you get great service and a friendly atmosphere but the kitchen isn't the most efficient. Park underground as the surface lot is limited and time restricted."}
{"text":"After 4 straight days of dim sum and Chinese food, my husband finally had enough and suggested that I yelp something new. My in-laws always count on me for \"adventurous\" eat. When I learned that none of them had had Filipino cuisine before, I knew we had to make a trip to Casa Manila. 

We came shortly after noon on Sunday and luckily snatched a table for 6 without reservation (Definitely make reservation even in a small group because this place was packed by the time we were leaving). 

We ordered 4 main dishes and 2 desserts to share - pork sisig, shrimp Gambas, Lechon kawali, milk fish, halo halo, and casava cake.  Initially we worried that we didn't order enough but the portion was generous and each dish was extremely rich. Food was made fresh to order and did take some time to prepare. But they were definitely worth waiting for!  

Pork sisig - the best best best sisig I've had!I've had many in the city where the sisig were soupy and runny. The ones here are crunchy and every bite was explosion of flavor! My only regret was not ordering more! 

Lechon kawali - very similar to the roasted pork belly in Chinese restaurants. Crunchy, juicy, and tender! Not too fatty, so yummy! Ask for extra dipping sauce! 

Milk fish - perfectly seasoned and made. They even debone it for you! My mother in law polished this dish! 

Shrimp Gambas - this was a disappointing dish. Small shrimp with diced peppers drenched in oil. Reminded us more of a regular Chinese dish. Lack of flavor and pool of oil = a definite miss. 

Halo halo - was enough to split it into 6 small bowls to share! It was refreshing but nothing too unique about this particular halo halo - aside from ratio of ice to toppings - could definitely use a bigger scoop of ube ice cream and more toppings. 

Casava cake - this cake tasted like an hybrid of flan and blondies. So so good! It had a soft flanny center but a chewy top and base. Arg I want more now! 

Overall, we were all impressed! My brother In law found a new go to lunch spot and I earned another brownie point as the family foodie."}
{"text":"The food is great however the wait times need some work. We sat down at noon and we were not served our mains until 1pm. Two hours later, I've attempted to get a server to grab our bill and they were too busy taking selfies and counting tips to even notice."}
{"text":"grossed out, ordered beef and vegetable peanut butter sauce--felt like eatting straight up peanut better with my beef and veggies. didn't like it all. bad first impression for me and will not return. btw, tried going on their site to check out what i ordered, but not easy to view--adobe flash only it seems)"}
{"text":"This was my first exposure to Filipino cuisine, so maybe my experience is limited, but given the limited Filipino options in Toronto in general, I do think this place is as good as it gets. Don't worry, though, they set the bar high.

Perhaps the restaurant is aware of the limited experience most non-Pinoy Torontonians have had with Filipino cuisine, so the staff are all extremely knowledgeable about their dishes and helpful with the selection.

The menu itself is varied and extensive without being cluttered. In particular, I'm a big fan of their congee-like soups which are the perfect size for one or two people. The only dish I'm not really fond of is the mango salad -- it's a little too simple, and the shrimp paste dressing a little too strong. This might just be my tastes, though, and all the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. They also have Filipino desserts and drinks, and sometimes in the summer I'll pop in just for halo-halo.

The atmosphere is warm and festive, in no small part due to the friendly staff. The clientele seems to consist of both newcomers and many regulars.

In case it wasn't obvious already, the service here is REALLY great! The higher up staff in particular are very warm and inviting. Actually, the last time I went, I ordered the lemongrass chicken leg. They were low on leg in the kitchen and knew we had already been waiting a while so served me the breast instead, even though that's a dollar more. It was a very small change, so I didn't mind at all, but they were all apologies and then took the item off of our bill! (We gave them big tips, of course.)

Only con is the food takes a while to prepare, so don't pop in here if you're in a hurry. If you have time to really relax and savour the food, though, I really recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went there with a group of friends for their winterlicious menu. I picked the mussels as the starters, the mussels were fresh but the sauce was a bit sour for me. The milkfish sisig was great though I felt a bit greasy at the end. The rice pudding was better than I expected. It tasted more like a red bean soup. It's smooth and mild. My friends had the leche flan and we all agreed it was too heavy and sweet. We also shared the grill platter which was ok, nothing really stood out. The staff were friendly but the waiting time was long on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try the kamayan, so for my birthday this year, we decided to go.  We booked 3 weeks in advance for the Kamayan experience.  We realized there was Winterlicious going on when we got to the restaurant.  We sat at a reserved table, decorated with banana leaves and coconut cups - that was cute and interesting.  Because it was booked in advance, we chose from the menu when we made the reservations already.  We constantly saw food being brought out to other tables, and all the staff were too busy serving other tables to serve us.  Nobody served us water or asked if we wanted anything to drink from the time we sat down, until we asked the server ourselves. We waited for the food for over an hour - our reservation was at 6:30pm, the food did not come until 7:45pm.  We were a party of 6 + 1(a baby), when they finally brought out our food, we realized they gave us 7 portions.  Immediately, we notified the server and his response was \"You told me 7 people.  But that's besides the point, we will take one portion back.\"  How rude, but our food was finally here, we were too hungry to complain.  When it was time for dessert, they asked if we had a celebration and we told them it was a birthday.  They brought out our dessert, and we put the dessert right in front of me since it was my birthday.   However, they forgot to bring out the sparkler candle.  When the server brought out the candle, he pulled the dessert closer to himself to light it up, so we left it there in case the sparkler tips over.  The rest of the crew joined in to sing us a Happy Birthday song - thank you for that.  However, when the song was over, the server asked us \"Who's birthday is it?\", I said it was mine, and his response was \"Seems like it's nobody's birthday.\" How rude was that comment?  It you hadn't pulled away the dessert from me, would it have seem more like my birthday?  Overall, we had a terrible first time experience.  Food was alright, but we would definitely not come again due to the service that we got.  I would recommend to not book the Kamayan during Winterlicious or Summerlicious.  Or the restaurant should not have both dinning experience going on at the same time."}
{"text":"Went there with a small group for Kamayan feast on a weekend night. The place was already rocking by the time we sat down around 630. 

Comfortable chairs but outdated decor. Whatever, I'm here for the food. 

We ordered crispy pork belly (5 because pork belly is always 5) garlic soy chicken (5)  adobo coconut beef (2, tasty but really chewy, not a good cut) shrimp paste veggies (3) and fish fillets (4). On a large bed of rice very tasty and filling. Only half our party actually finished the rest took their leftovers home. (I cooked a bit of rice some extra veggies at home the following night and literally had the feast again only with utensils the second time). 

We also got some deep fried chicken skin for apps (comes with the meal we didn't order it). The first bite was good but after that it was a bit too greasy for my tastes. 

Got the jug of Mohito but there was very little alcohol in it!

Dessert was ice cream that was tasteless and bland. Did not take more than one bite. 

Didn't really like eating with fingers. Not that I'm big on table manners or anything. I just found it to be very tiring on your fingers. Took too long just to get a bite."}
{"text":"We were a party of 40 for a birthday dinner and the restaurant was already quite busy but it took them 1hr 20mins to get our food out to us. Our drink orders took 15 to 30mins. Food came out warmish, I guess they had to wait for all of the food to be prepared and ready to serve at the same time but that's still no excuse as to why the food isn't more steamy or hot from the grill/oven. The managers and servers were not helpful and communicative about how the bill was being calculated and left the BIRTHDAY girls doing all the math because they had separated the drinks to another bill. The restaurant was under staff and unorganized. Their POS is outdated and not conducive for large parties needing to split the bill and they didn't keep track of drink orders for guests and everyone had to be asked/it had to be individually figure out. Overall, this could be a decent place to eat if you're not in a large group."}
{"text":"3.5 Had dinner here recently. The plaza is quite tiny but plenty of parking, which was mostly at the back or underground. 

The food was amazing for most part! I felt the portions were a bit small for the price though. We tried...

Crunchy Minced Meat - Sisig (Chicken) $11
Loved this. Another I could eat this everyday dish. Loved the crunchiness and it was super tasty. 

Crispy Baby Squid - Pritong Pusit $14
It was alright. There was some interesting coconut cream? inside the squid when you bite into it. 

Crispy Pork Hocks - Crispy Pata $16.00
I did not enjoy this dish at all as it felt like I was eating fat. Only had one piece. But I know lots who would love this. 

Milkfish - Daing na Bangus $14.00
Average. A bit bland. 

Coconut Ginger - Long Beans, Squash & Pepper $13.00
This was so good with the fried garlic white rice. YUM. I could eat this everyday. Love the coconut ginger. After this evening I was inspired to make my own version using a slow cooker. 

Service was good. We didn't wait that long for food even though it was an extremely busy evening. However, it was hard to track down the staff if we did need something. It was also weird at the end. The staff really wanted me to sign up for Vincinity. I thought I could just use my  App w/o having to sign up or my Chatime card lol Hey I have no idea how this crap works. But I was too lazy and he said \"Just sign it\". Felt weird and I decided not to sign off my life. 

Didn't try their ice cream/desserts although the waiter did come by to offer some samples. I would definitely come back again another time. Reservations definitely recommended. It was super busy on Saturday."}
{"text":"Great place. Came here two days in a row for lunch.

Overall, the food is delicious. Real good flavours, excellent kare kare, bangus, they even have kalamansi juice - you get some good philipino grub here for sure. 

Prices are very reasonable. Interior is funky. Service is a little slow. Adobo is a little dry. My only complaints."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 for this restaurant. My first time at a Filipino restaurant and I had a great time here! If you're looking for a good hearty meal and are feeling adventurous, come here. 

Our Filipino friend helped us order the \"must-tries/local dishes\". The 6 of us, 3 guys & 3 girls, shared two bowls of fried garlic rice, pork bicol (coconut pork and eggplant), grilled platter (bbq chicken, squid, pork belly) and pork sisig. Everyone was stuffed in the end. I personally wouldn't recommend the pork bicol as I didn't find the taste too special and it was rather pricey for the portion size. The skewers platter was delicious and highly recommended for meat lovers. Grilled squid was very tender. 

Sisig is a MUST! Pork belly and crispy pork skin served on a sizzling hot plate with a raw egg on top (I know, sounds crazy). We mixed the ingredients up and ate with the rice. My only complaint for this dish is that there wasn't much meat, just a lot of crunchy pork skin. 

As you can tell, our dinner was all carbs..but we still managed to find room for desserts. The rice pudding was very interesting and paired well with ice cream. We also ordered the halo halo which we couldn't finish. It reminded me a lot like the Thai dessert or the viet red bean dessert with coconut milk.

After dining at this restaurant, I mentioned this place to a few other Filipino friends and they agreed that their food is overall authentic. Casa Manila is also considered a higher end Filipino restaurant so don't expect a quick, cheap meal here."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to see on Yelp that there was a Filipino restaurant where you could actually order from a menu during dinner.  Most Filipino restaurants are a grocery/restaurant where the food is sitting on a food warmer.

First I'll comment on the food.  Pretty good.  i think it's something I think most Filipinos would approve of.  We had Palabok, Lechon Kawali, and Lumpia Shanghai for the appetizer.  Everything was cooked perfectly and if my parents were with me, they would actually compliment the food instead of complain about how they could cook better than this.

Unfortunately, my complaints about this place outweigh the good food.
1.)  Rice wasn't even included.  I had to pay for effing rice.  At least include SOME rice with the dish and then make me pay for an extra rice.  How the hell do you have filipino food and not have rice already included especially if a dish typically goes with rice?  I understand if it's noodles, you don't need rice.
2.)  Lumpia Shanghai was under the appetizer menu and it came out dead last after all the entrees.  
3.)  Our palabok came out and we were already done eating all of it and had to wait like 10 minutes before the lechon came out.
4.)  For our the appetizer, two entrees, and rice, after tip, we spent about $48.  That's too much for Filipino food.  
5.)  We stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes before someone finally seated us
6.)  It took forever for them to bring water to our table and we never got one refill.  

The wait staff looked pretty scatterbrained the whole time and the service we received reflected that.  I really wanted to love this place, but can't even recommend it because of the prices and the service.  Maybe you'll have a better experience at lunch when you can just serve yourself at the buffet and the price is actually decent."}
{"text":"Horrible place.  From the get go through out, the service was terrible.   Was seated and took forever to get acknowledged and when we did, we were asked for our order, except we didn't have any menus yet.  Then we were offered a $27 buffet instead of menus.  Took forever to get our water and drinks.  Ordered appetisers and food.  Got appetisers with mains, served with no mind that we didn't have any plates or cutlery.  Took forever.  Not once we're we asked how everything was so I never had the chance to say terrible.  Owners are completely oblivious.   The food was meh. The bill came fast though.

The worst restaurant experience ever."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday party and had the Kamayan feast #3. Service was what stood out for me here. They welcomed us like family and you can tell that they are proud of their food. 

The experience was well worth it. Eating at the banana leaf table with your hands. Something about eating with your hands makes food tastier. The food itself was good but not so outstanding that I would want to eat here every week. It definitely has a home cooked meal type of feel to it, which is welcoming. 

They went above and beyond to accommodate dietary restrictions and we had an amazing time here. 

We will come back if we have a party again - especially just for people to try the Kamayan experience."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Went on a Tuesday night the service was pretty slow, but I don't usually go to Filipino restaurant so I was excited to eat and was willing to wait. 
Anyway I went with my vegan friend and I love how there's a special menu for it. Ordered fried spring roll, 2pcs in my opinion needs salt and super oily. Ordered tofu adobo and tofu salpicado both are ok. I prefer the adobo betters ordered the Laing this was really good even with out the bagoong. 
We ordered mango juice but never came so we kept asking the server and we just ended up canceling it. 
Had the buko pandan which I believe said it was vegan? But it was served with ice cream so my friend didn't end up eating it. 
Price for 4 things 2 garlic rice dessert $90
I think it's really expensive come to think of it. We had all vegetables only and tofu. For the price I would have gone somewhere else or ask mom to cook."}
{"text":"I'd love to be friends with Zaldi and the owner (cuz they're as sweet and chatty as they come) but will never eat at their establishment again. The Yelp stars which guided us to this place are way off. 

Everything that could possibly go wrong, went wrong.

Upon entering, we noticed the cheerful ethnic decor and were pleased by the ambiance.  However, we also spotted an empty table right at the entrance piled high with empty beer bottles ( which continued to be dirty throughout our visit)!
We waited for a while, but since no hostess appeared we had to flag down a waiter to ask to be seated( we had made reservations).
After we sat down I noticed a lot of dishes being mistakenly served to tables, since they were being taken away immediately as fully loaded as they came.
So when it was time for us to order I made sure that the waitress repeated our order after she jotted it down.
After waiting for a very long time, ANOTHER waitress brought out one dish which turned out to be an entree! We hadn't even gotten our appetizer at that point. After I pointed this fact to the waitress she shrugged and said that if I didn't eat the entree then, it would just turn cold! Well, I sent it back and asked for the appetizers to be brought out.
At this point I flagged down the proprietor and she was super nice and apologized. She immediately brought out a dish that turned out to be a BEEF dish, INSTEAD of the SEAFOOD Platter we had ordered! Turns out, the waitress who had initially taken our order made a mistake with our order but it's beyond me how she could've gotten it wrong after I made her repeat it! She did come back and apologize for it.

By this point, we were just meh! let us just eat something. We kept ourselves entertained counting the number of knots in the jute curtains! The food that was brought out was greasy, unremarkable and disappointing. The Sizzling Seafood Salpicado which was an array of seafood bits on a sizzling platter (that didn't sizzle)  tasted exactly the same as the Sizzling Garlic Shrimp Dinner that we had ordered! I had the Pork Sisig and I just couldn't eat it: it was like eating savory brittle: crunchy, dry, clumpy and very greasy. Our waitress had highly recommended it, but forgot to tell me that it would be so crunchy and dry. I wouldn't have ordered it.

For dessert we had Halo Halo and Buko Pandan. I quite liked the Buko Pandan which was creamy, coconuty with lots of ice cream! 

The owners were very sympathetic to our concerns and did compensate us for the shoddy service we received. I'd add them as friends on Facebook, but do not recommend Casa Manila to folks who are unfamiliar with Filipino Cuisine!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's better if you go with at least 4+ people because the dishes are large and meant to be shared. We took a friend from New York and he loves it! Couldn't stop eating. We typically come here with friends and family. The more people you have the better the experience. They have this amazing beef marrow soup, crispy pork belly and everything is so fresh. The service is ok, sometimes it gets busy and people forget stuff but all in all a unique food experience."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for the Kamayan.  For $30 a person, you get a really generous portion of short ribs, shrimps, pork and chicken with coconut rice and veg served on banana leaf! You also eat off the banana leaf. I had some sanitary concerns at first but decided to just go for the ride. There are utensils available but its suggested that you eat with your hands. I guess it also more fun this way.  

So, reason for the 3 star, the meat.  The meat just simply wasn't very tasty and it was served luke warm.  The beef ribs were also a bit dry and salty.   With all that meat, it would be nice if it was accompanied by a bigger veggie portion. After the main, we got a gigantic bowl of dessert call halo halo which was shaved ice with ice cream, jack fruit and jelly. That was amazing!

 It was a good experience overall but I won't be back for the kayman as they charge 20% gratuity for this.  I don't think the service we received justify the 20% as our empty water cups was never refilled unless we asked and our server never took the time to explain any of the dishes to us."}
{"text":"Always good service at Casa Manila.  Good food but it doesn't always come out hot, not sure why.  They have a lot of private functions so try to go when they are less busy and things should go really good. The decor is great and the owner seems to spend a lot of time making sure the ambience is awesome.  It's our go-to Filipino food establishment."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Filipino food but once in awhile it's nice to have something different from Japanese and Vietnamese which I seem to always end up picking.  If I'm thinking Filipino then Casa Manila is the place.

Came here last night on Friday at around 6pm so I know we will likely get a table.  I know the place does get pretty full on Friday night so I would recommend you make reservations unless you dine like us at 6pm which is usually a little early for most people.  My husband loves the Grilled BBQ Pork Skewers here so tonight was no exception on ordering this.  The skewers are appetizers but we usually like to have as one of the main course for sharing so we usually place 2 orders that will give us 4 skewers for $14.  As usual the BBQ pork was delicious!  Between the three of us, we always fight over the last skewer - we definitely should place 3 orders next time!  The Kare Kare (peanut garlic stew with your choice of meat) here is delicious but since we always order this dish, I decided to try something else this time.  I ended up ordering a coconut long beans & squash dish and grilled lemon grass chicken.  Both dishes were good and we had steam rice to go with all the dishes.  We were extremely full so there was no room for dessert this time.  I guess I'll have to wait until next time to get my fav dessert, Halo Halo (shaved ice, milk, layers of fruits and sweet beans, with Taro ice cream and syrup)."}
{"text":"I have been going to this establishment  regularly for the past 2 years . The food is good but service was always inconsistent sometimes great.. Sometimes slow .. But I was willing to overlook BC overall it was a good experience .. 
Today I went when they were throwing an event .. Big mistake .. We sat and ordered our items.  As we waited they then started to rearranged the party area to make it bigger we were ask to move BC they could not promise that we would be served . This is after we ordered and sat there for over 10 minutes waiting for our food.  After my husband politely refused to move from our booth, they advised us it's for the party.   I understand large parties bring more money .. But being Rudely dismissed is NOT exceptable customer service ."}
{"text":"Really good for boodle (aka Kamayan). I hosted a surprise bday party for a friend here and they tended to cater to my accommodations very well. Excellent service and very friendly! 

The food had to be ordered and decided ahead of time for kamayan. I have gone here twice for kamayan and it was very tasty! I loved the adobo chicken, Kare Kare, crispy pata and their halo-halo (with the little crunchy pieces embedded inside too!) This place has all you can eat rice with kamayan as well. Excellent quality food and you will definitely be full afterwards. 

All in all would definitely go back for kamayan for a party of over 4 people. Very helpful and accommodating!"}
{"text":"FOOD:

PRO: 
- Best Kare-Kare in Toronto! You can tell them how spicy you want your Kare-Kare to be and they will serve it you the way you want it. 
- Sisig tastes good, though very fatty. 
- Pancit Malabon has lots of ingredients, good flavor and texture, but lacks salt. This is not a deal breaker though coz you can just add some salt to it and it's gonna be the bomb. 
- Buko (Coconut) Ice Cream is a bit above normal sweetness for me, but still tastes so good. 
- Overall: Almost all dishes here are really good. 

CON:
- They need to add more serving to their Kare-Kare coz it felt like they could add more meat and vegetables to it. 
- They need to replace belly fat into lean meat, at least some of them so that it will not be too fatty. Currently it has like 80% belly fat and 20% lean meat. 
- They can make the saltiness level of their Pancit Malabon better, so customers don't need to add the salt on it themselves.
- Decrease the sweetness (just a lil bit) from your Buko Ice Cream and it would be perfect.

PRICE:

PRO: A lil bit expensive but you get the value of what you paid for coz it tastes awesome.

SERVICE:

PRO: Awesome service! Really friendly staff, very accommodating, you will see genuine smiles and will help you decide what to order by recommending their best sellers. 
CON: You will feel guilty not to give a good tip on top of your bill. Haha!

AMBIANCE:

PRO: Feels like you're dining in the Philippines. They have nice design. They used bamboos and seashells inside the restaurant which feels very Filipino, and they play Filipino music inside. 

RECOMMENDATION:

You must try their Kare-Kare. So authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious during lunch with a friend. We had the rice soup and BBQ chicken skewers for our apps, kare kare and chicken adobo for our mains, and the leche flan and ube taro ice cream for dessert. Unfortunately, they ran out of the ube taro and chocolate cake from last night's dinner service. The BBQ chicken skewers were YUM, everything else was just okay.

Seating was a bit cramp and our app and entree came at the same time for some reason. Overall, it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group (12 people) for birthday celebration of my cousin in a Sunday night. First, I liked the interior of the restaurant, it has a homey feeling. The restaurant is not really busy and packed at all but they gave us a table that is really not fit for all of us with all the food we ordered. We can barely move and the table is just really small and crowded with the foods and plates, utensils and beverages. The service is really really slow, the foods were disappointing, it was ok, nothing special and remarkable. I liked the desserts (ube cake, buko pandan, halo-halo) and when the management found out that there's someone celebrating a birthday in our group they lit a candle and sang  overall, I think there's still a lot of great filipino restaurants better than this to visit in Toronto."}
{"text":"The parking for this place is terribly small and cramped, but when you walk in you're greeted with vibrant and colourfully classic decor. From top to bottom, the walls and the doors are all beautifully decorated with art, sculpting, plants, and the works.

We came for the kamayan, and I was a bit hesitant. I've had Filipino food before, but the experience here had completely blown them out of the water. The food was fresh, filling, so delicious, and reasonably priced. 

They gave us pork rinds and soup as appetizers. The soup was pretty good, but those pork rinds were so crispy! They were covered in this creamy thousand island-esk sauce with spring onions and pickled papaya. Best pork rinds I've ever had.

For the actual kamayan, it's a memorable experience. They play drums as they bring out this massive platter topped with rice, meat, and vegetables. You can choose what you want in your kamayan before hand. Ours had crispy pork belly, shrimp, chicken skewers, short ribs and mango salad. Everything was so delicious. The freshness of the mango salad and pickled papaya with the rice went so well with the meat. Everything had a nicely seasoned barbecue flavour to it. 

For dessert we had halo halo. I'm usually not a big fan of halo halo, but this one was pretty good. It came in this huge bowl with a sparkler sticking out of it. However by the time dessert came, I was already starting to tap out from dinner.

The only downside to this experience is that there is a mandatory service charge of 20% added to your bill. Excluding tax and tip, it's about $30 a head. I would definitely come back again. The pork rinds are still calling my name..."}
{"text":"Over priced for Filipino food but food OK.  Bad service...only from the lady owner who wore bright pink lipstick."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Casa Manila for years now. We've come here since the first owner, and now the recent one. I must say the food has been consistently good, hence the 2 star rating. I took 3 starts out because although the food is consistent, service was also consistent, consistently horrible. Every time we come here, it takes us approximately 4 hours from the time we enter and leave the restaurant. 4 hours is a lot of time wasted just waiting 70% for food and 30% for the bill, which is just not acceptable. We haven't visited for a few months now because of the last time we came. We availed the valentines day special, for my parents, and my boyfriend who came all the way from the states. We had to wait about 2 hours for our kamayan, even though we have made the reservation at least a week before. Now I understand that it was busy and all, but when is it not busy during Valentines day? They should've prepared and anticipated the outpour of people that night based on how many reservations were made. My family and I were so disappointed, and will not return until management does something about their service. Which is a hard decision since we do love their food so much."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant. The food was so-so. However, their customer service is nonexistent. It took a whole 20 mins for them to take our order (we had to call them).We waited for an hour just to get our water (again, we had to ask..really?). It is extremely disappointing and I am embarrassed as I am Filipino and I was talking about how good Filipino food is. When the food came, my milkfish was cold. My friend ordered creamy coconut veggies with tofu, and guess what? There were only two tiny pieces of tofu! We ordered hot tea that took 1 hour and 20 mins.. we asked and they said the tea wasn't ready. Did they have to go to the mountains and pick up the tea leaves???? The manager comes to us after 1.5 hours and goes \"you got all your food right?\" then walks away. No discount for the hassle nor any complimentary treats. Honestly they should just pack their bags and close the restaurant. I would highly recommend that you not go to this restaurant. It is an embarrassment and does not reflect filipino hospitality nor culture."}
{"text":"My experience with Casa Manila was based just on their desserts.

Came here 30 minute before closing as our group as usual wants some sweet happy ending. Casa Manila has been on my to go list for the longest time so I was happy to give it a try.

The waitstaff here are really nice but service was definitely really slow. I know good food needs time to prepare but aside from Turon is freshly made, the rest of the food we ordered are just pre made or with really minimum effort in preparation.

We shared:

- Halo Halo ($6.99)

- Turon - Crispy Banana Crepes ($5.99)

- Buko Pandan with Ube Ice Cream ($7.99)

- Cassava Cake ($4.99)

I really enjoyed all the items we ordered! Especially the ube ice cream! Just wish that it is bigger!

I might be back to Casa Manila to try out other Filipino dishes and hopefully the service would improve as I don't want to have a 3 hour meal, I might fall asleep waiting for my food!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, but this restaurant had the worst service that I have ever had. We had to get up to go to our waitress to ask for water because she would never walk by or even look in our direction. What's more is that she didn't even remember what table we were at. There many other issues with the service as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and its always a fun and relaxing experience.  The staff are super friendly and very accommodating, they will do what they can to help you have a great experience.  I started coming even more frequently after seeing the show, \"you've got to eat here\", which was on the food network.  They recommended the Chicken Sisig fries, which is a \"Super-Works\" all in one poutine but with more.  My wife and I ordered that, plus the Manila Thai Curry dish along with rice.  OMG, it was soooooo good!  We both fell in love with the chicken sisig fries, plus the Manila Thai Curry (we chose tofu for that one) really makes a great combination with the sisig fries.  Also, try out the Calamansi mojito (i think that's what it was).  It was refreshingly delicious.  Filipino cuisine isn't really my thing, as I grew up eating it at home when I was younger.  I liked Italian and chinese more.  However, Casa Manila has changed my mind, as the dishes are creative and are similar to fusion cuisine.  But these delicious dishes are taken to a whole new level.  Whenever I crave for a poutine, I immediately think of the Chicken sisig fries and we drive to Casa Manila.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, above average tasting food (though not mind blowing), a bit to the pricier end though = 3.5/5 overall! 

We did the Kambayan feast and I got the vegetarian option. It came with a soup, and a variety of main dishes that's on one giant plate. It tasted like very basic grill dishes and nothing super mind blowing. The ambience of the place was great though. They would do the drums before bringing out the food and it's quite fancy overall. 

The food I enjoyed the most was probably the DRINKS! You have to get their classic Filipino version of lime mojito. 

We also got the classic dessert: Halo halo. Which was delicious! It's essentially the Filipino version of red bean ice cream with a lot more stuff in there. 

We all paid $35 each for this which was quite pricey but not bad overall considering the variety of food you get with it! The location isn't the most convenient to get to but if you're from north York and have a car I guess it's not too bad. 

Verdict: get the drinks and halo halo dessert. Not sure if I would do the kambayan feast but cute place to try Filipino food."}
{"text":"Filipino cuisine has always been heavily overshadowed by many of its direct neighbors like Thai or Viet food. In addition, \"Asian food\" is more commonly associated by Westerners to predominantly Chinese, Japanese, or Korean food. Rarely does Filipino culture stand out in any aspect. Given that, I came to this restaurant bearing no expectations but open-minded taste buds hoping for a good first experience. 

I came with a small party so I only ordered the chicken sisig and pork bicol express with garlic rice on the side. The bicol express can be closely compared to curry, but it definitely holds its ground as its own individual dish by differentiating itself with a sweeter flavor and strong coconut aroma. It's a very palatable dish, but nothing compared to the intensity of the sizzling sisig. Besides being ridiculously unhealthy, the sisig balances the crunchy texture with heavy seasoning, and the zestiness of lemon heightens the overall dish to level of mouthwatering, salivation overload.

The staff is friendly and prompt (on a weekday night), and the owner/manager personally attended every table at the end of service. Hygiene being a common downfall for Asian restaurants; the restaurant was incredibly tidy and clean albeit being a little clusterphobic in some of their decor choices (and website)."}
{"text":"If yelp only have negative star, this restaurant will get 5 negative . The food doesn't taste what it's suppose to taste. For example. The dish called \" tinola \" taste like water and you really can't taste the real tinola. The crew need a training big time they look confuse. No one clean our table. Old plate from previous order got stuck on our table till we leave. I wasn't feeling the philippine culture. The place is crowded with junk! I will not go back to this place. Did k mention it is expensive for a dish that doesn't taste anything. I DONT RECOMMEND TJIS PLACE. IM A VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER. . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. if decided to go! GOOD LUCK!!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience today lack of service ... food delivery slow ... no one checking up on our order ... BUT when asking for bill it came quickly BUT alas it wasn't our bill waited again.... i left and let wife handle it im DONE"}
{"text":"Don't come here for Summerlicious. This is a live review. First of all, I never write a review for restaurants because I'm usually forgiving of the service. But this is the first time I've ever received such poor attention and hospitality at a restaurant. 

I'm sitting at the restaurant as we speak. I made a reservation at 1pm for a table of 3, had to wait 20 minutes to put in our order, 30 minutes until we had to ask for water ourselves, an hour and a half now and our appetizers haven't arrived. 

We have watched a table eat their entire meal and paid for their meal and left. We watched a couple sit down at the hour and a half mark and still get their food before ours. 

I have made lovely conversation with the two tables beside me complaining about their slow service. 

I have just left. I repeat, don't come here for summerlicious."}
{"text":"Ordered kare-kare, pork sisig and mango salad on a Saturday lunch.  Kare-kare was heavenly but portion size is quite small for the price. Pork sisig was very very dry, bland and every morsel was extremely hard and too crunchy. We should have returned it back.  The mango salad with the sesame dressing and shrimp paste was okay. Garlic fried rice very tasty but the portions were not consistent. Our second order seemed to be a lot more than our first order. Service was okay. Female servers seemed to be more attentive than a male server who kept on chatting with other people. Our second order of rice took awhile (we ordered from the male server) but when we followed up with a female server, it was immediately served. Hope these comments would help improve the food and service at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was invited to Casa Manila (@CasamanilaCa) for a media tasting and was lucky to try their new \"Kamayan\" style dinner where we got to eat with our hands
I was surprise to arrive at a fairly packed restaurant at around 6:00pm with the rest of the tables already reserved. No wonder since Philippine Restaurants are hard to come by in Toronto which I always find it surprising given the large Filipino population.  

Traditional Kamayan Style dinner means eating with our hands with fresh banana leaves as our plates. It's funny how our amazing waiter kept reminding us not to put our stuff on our plate aka the table covered by the banana leaves. Kamayan is basically a family style picnic allowing everyone to gather around to pick and choose whatever they like to eat. I have always love eating with my eats, everything just taste better so this was definitely a very fun experience for me.

Adobo Popcorn to munch on while waiting for everyone to arrives.

Calamansi Mojito Mocktail
~ Calamansi is the national citrus of the Philippines, it was a nice twist to my favorite classic cocktail.

Philippines' Root Beer Sarsi & San Miguel Beer

This is actually my second time here and it was over a year ago but I still remember getting a bit confuse as to what to order and our server offer little help in explaining or recommendation department. But this time around, we got the owner Mila Nabor-Cuachon to explain in details the ingredients and origins of each dish. So informative!!!

Chicharon Manok and Atchara
~ Chicken cracklings with a light Adobo seasoning topped with their Mabuhay pickled green papaya slaw served with garlic aioli
~ Traditionally made with pork skin, this was a nice twist and no idea how they got it so perfectly crisp.

Lumpia Shanghai
~ A meaty center version of the Filipino springroll which was definitely Chinese original.

Sinigang Baka
~ Beef Tamarind Soup
~ I am a total sucker for sour soup and the flavor here was so well balanced, no MSG and very light refreshing to start off an otherwise heavy meal.

We were given 6 sauces each for our meal, it's nice to experiment which each meat goes better with which sauce. Casa Manila lauched their own Mabuhay collection with 3 sauces : Adobo (fat free & vegan), Creamy Coconut Ginataan (no MSG, Gluten Free & Vegan) and Savoury Peanut Sauce Kare Kare (no MSG & Gluten Free).

There was also a few quick demonstration showing how easy and quick to cook a meal with the sauces. With simple instruction at the back of the bottle, everyone can unleash their inner chef.

Tinuhog na Manok
~ Chicken Skewers for us to try out the sauces.

And tada what everyone was waiting for, the Kamayan feast and yes that's what happen at a Media event.... and for something this epic, it took a little longer than usual since obviously you need a picture from every angle 

Inihaw Baka
~ Thinly sliced grilled beef ribs infused with their special marinade

Lechon Kawali
~ Crispy pork belly is a Filipino iconic favorite, the pork belly fried crispy skin and softly marbled meat perfect with the Mabuhay Lechon Sauce or Seasoned Vinegar

Hilaw Manga Insalada
~ Green mango salad, a combination of jicamas, tomato, red and green onions. A tangy salad perfect with the fried food

Flying Tilapia
~ this fried fish presentation was just amazing and it was perfectly cooked, so flaky tender and yummy crispy skin

Plus Garlic Rice which was so addictive, papaya slaw and Thai chili peppers if you want some heat.

With the Kamayan feast, there's choice of add-ons and we got to try the Sisig Pork Mask and bangus \"milk fish\".

Halo Halo (Mix Mix)
~ Just as the meal itself the dessert was just as epic, this huge Halo Halo fed the 12 of us and still had leftovers.
~ This dessert have a dozen ingredients that represents the mix of cultures that make up of Filipino culture. Finely shaved ice covered with a cream mixture, topped with assorted fruits, sweet beans, custard, purple am, puffed rice and crowned with Casa Manila's own Mabuhay Ube (taro) ice cream.

Made by Marble Slab, Casa Manila is selling their own Philippines ice cream flavors including ube (taro, coconut, mango, halo halo and avocado. The avocado was so creamy good but the ube was just like the one in Philippines. OMG good, will need to go back to bring some home.

We all did pretty good at finishing the food, so stuffed.

Left with a goodie to try at home.

Verdict:
Eating with your hands are extremely fun
What a deal at $28pp for the Kamayan Dinner (min 4ppl), sure no one will be leaving hungry.
Their also have a really large menu selection, all very authentic
No MSG, very low sodium and oil
Oh and need to come back to get their ice cream"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with my boy fried. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation and we need to wait for a few minutes before the waitress bring us to our table. The restaurant is very busy but waitress did come and make sure everything is good on a regular basis. The owner of the restaurant (Mila) is very friend and she said hi to all the customers and she even took our order for us!!

We've ordered the Casa Manila salad for appetizers, crispy pork belly and chicken adobo for main.  Food are very yummy and portions are big too!!! As for dessert we had flan and ube ice cream.   We've also order coconut dream as our drink !!

I will definitely come back again next time to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience of an authentic Filipino restaurant and I was impressed. The food was quite good and a nice blend of Asian and western cuisine. Prices seem reasonable - an interesting experience.

Service was a bit slow and there was a slight feeling of being disorganized. For example, there was quite a queue waiting for dinner, but quite a few tables were left unattended to for some time after the guests departed.  However the servers were friendly and polite. So patrons were patient in waiting at the tiny foyer.

Parking at that strip mall was problematic and it would appear that the various shops at the location may be warring over parking. That does not contribute to a confident visit. That needs to be sorted out."}
{"text":"Took Phoenix here for the first time after failing miserably a couple of weeks ago when we couldn't get into the restaurant as it was booked with a wedding (and who wouldn't want to celebrate here?) 

Thanksgiving Sunday, owners were not around, but the quality of food we ordered and service we received is still top notch.  That means that they are self sufficient without someone needing to watch over.

We got the grilled shared platter along with garlic quinoa and garlic brown rice.

The grilled shared platter included the BBQ chicken sticks, tender juicy pieces of meat marinated in Filipino style BBQ sauce (not the BBQ we get in North America which is a bit spicier) this is more on the sweet side.

They had liempo, but I regret eating it too slowly, I should've wolfed those down first while they were still tender.  It got a bit tougher when it cooled down.

Their grilled squids are well done.  It's rare to eat squid that is still soft but flavorful on a grill for me at restaurants.  Most places they end up being really tough to chew, but these were easy on the teeth.

The garlic quinoa may be a bit of an acquired taste, it has a slight bitterness.  It is likely fresh and not something pre-washed and prepackaged so it still has a bit of saponin.  I have to emphasize on slight, most people won't even notice it and the garlic usually masks the flavor.

The garlic brown rice is made with the same rice as sushi rice.  Very puffy and radiates a stronger rice scent than the normal ones we get at T&T.

The rice and quinoa goes well with the grilled platter and fills you up.  I would likely order this again but only with casual eaters not heavy eaters because it would feel a bit small.

One new thing they added, they now serve Filipino themed ice cream provided by Marble Slab Creamery.   They have a tasting area as well so you can try out a few.

Since I was already stuffed from my meal, I just did the tasting.  From the ones I have tasted that I remember here's my review.

* Ube/Taro tasted more like taro than the Ube (purple yam) flavor I am used to.
* Filipino Chocolate tasted like champorado with milk and a bit of sugar.  Quite nostalgic.

I ended up buying 1L of their Filipino Chocolate because I wanted to make my own joke-only affogato at home.  I don't regret doing so, I've had a few of these already since I got it.

I kind of wish they teamed up with Love Gelato instead.  However, Marble Slab isn't bad considering it is ice cream and not gelato.

Casa Manila is still my favorite Filipino restaurant that I have been to on the planet.  When I go back to the Philippines and eat Filipino food, I miss the way they make it here in Casa Manila."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they didn't seem prepared for the long weekend crowds.  Reservations are a must.  But the food was great.  Recommended.  We tried the kamayan special and everyone enjoyed it,  will try again when they are not as busy!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write review because most the time the restaurant that I've been to are either great or pretty descent. But this time, I needed to say something because of my disappointment with this restaurant.
Before going here, I booked a table online for 4 people. As soon as we arrived, the lady who I assumed is the receptionist asked if we have a reservation then I told her my name and she assisted us to our table. It felt good at first, the environment itself really feels like your home. The decorations and music is all about Philippines which is amazing. But then our nightmare starts, it was 8:30 P.M when we seated in our table we waited for about 5 minutes before the lady which is the receptionist and now turned into server gave us the menu. After a glance with the menu we decided to order our appetizer which is the calamari, when the server was back we order calamari and asked her if we could all get a glass of water, a beer for my uncle (which a white descent), and an ice tea for my daughter. She was very nice smiling and all, she took the order and left, we waited for about 15 minutes no water, no beer and no ice tea. When I saw her passing by I asked her again about our appetizer order the drinks and she said it will be out soon, so we proceed to order our dinner. We all decided to get a platter of white rice (which I assumed a platter would be good for 4 people, boy I was wrong), a sinigang, daing na bangus, sisig and chicken curry for my uncle. Another 10 minutes went by and we get our first order the calamari and then my uncle reminded her again about his beer and our water. Another 10 minutes before she came back with the beer and water and the sisig, but then there was no plates, serviettes and utensils (how are we going to eat this?), and they did not mention in the menu that the pork sisig was actually a FINELY GRIND pork sisig.  (Cusina has way better sisig). After another 15minutes we get our sinigang and rice (presentation was great but serving size i thought it is good for atleast 3 people but it was only good for my 7 years old daughter), few minutes later there's the bangus. My aunt, my daughter and I started eating leaving enough rice for my uncle while my daughter was complaining that she want more because it was not enough. After about 20-25 minutes the server came back and my uncle told her that if the chicken curry is not ready yet she should just leave it because it was way too late now and that he already decided to just get a sandwich at subway which is beside them. She was very apologetic and said that she will check and came back with the curry we stayed for another 10 minutes while my uncle was just starting to eat his food which is around 9:35-9:40. We asked for the bill and reminded the server that we never get my daughters ice tea so just make sure that we don't get charged for that. After 1 hour and about 30 to 45 minutes we had enough, pay the bill which is by the way very expensive for the amount of food that we get (almost $100), the service was very slow, and the place was way too hot. 
Overall, I will never recommend this place to anyone. You're all better off spending your money to a place which is worth it. There's Cusina or Sampaguita by bathurst and wilson which I consider good for a filipino restaurant, service is fast and amount of food is worth the price.

Sorry for the long review, I felt like I had to share every single detail that happened in that restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious 2016 and the menu items were super tasty! Each course was made with quality - it tasted very authentic. For my main I ordered oxtail with rice and shrimp paste. It was mouthwatering good and juicy! The atmosphere was very casual, and it makes you feel like you're in the Philippines because of the decor and design. Servers were friendly and accommodated our needs. Maybe I'll come back in the future and try a regular menu item!"}
{"text":"Cluttered restaurant with bulky chairs and weird table cloths. Food is very whitewashed and while tasty, is nothing special. 
Relies heavily on sauces to provide flavor. 
Ambience reminds me of a family get together at some aunts house who is also a hoarder. 
Would come back, but possibly only for take out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Casa Manila around 4pm yesterday and absolutely loved the food. We'd never tried authentic sinigang free from MSG prior to our experience here, so our tastebuds were delighted to say the least. The portion was ideal for sharing and we both appreciated that you could customize the level of sourness and spiciness. The only downside was that they were out of pork ribs, which is what we initially asked for, but the pork belly was a great substitution. They even gave us complimentary chicharon to compensate. 

My boyfriend ordered the chicken adobo and he has nothing but positive things to say about the dish. Chicken was tender, the sauce was flavorful, and the garlic rice paired well-said it tasted just like home. 

We finished off our meal with the halo-halo and it didn't disappoint either. I was so full by the end of my meal, I didn't think my boyfriend and I could finish it, but based on how good it was, I could've easily had one for myself lol! 

Would definitely recommend. I anticipate on returning for a second visit."}
