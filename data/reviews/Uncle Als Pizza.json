{"text":"Undercooked raw dough. There was cheddar cheese on top.  Cheddar cheese does not belong on pizza.  For a comparison on quality, I'd have preferred a frozen Digiorno pizza to this.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Tried places all around town since moving here. For price and quality I believe this to be the best. As far as the comment of staff being rude, I would disagree so far. The call taker was very nice and showed patience as I tried to figure out my order since I was never there before and tried doing it over the phone. Took my order and told me about 45 minutes for delivery. 33 minutes later our order arrived and was like it just came out of the over, fresh and hot. All in all very pleased with great tasting food. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Pizza is above average quality and pretty tasty. The prices are too high to get a higher review."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Olmsted Falls! I had been looking for pizza places that deliver to our house and happened to find Uncle Al's. I'm in love with their pizza. Perfect toppings, sauce and the crust is delicious. I love their Island Oasis and their Chicken Bacon Ranch pizzas. I always want to try something else but can never resist going with the pizza. We've used them for parties also and have gotten many compliments on the great pizza."}
{"text":"We've ordered pizza from here at least once a month for the past several months.  We've tried both the thin and thick crust - and prefer the thin crust.  Their pizza is saucy and plenty of cheese.    Another favorite is the BLT fold over, hold the mayo.  The fold over is not exactly a calzone, more like a cheese pizza folded in half with bacon, lettuce and tomato in the middle.  We've tried other varieties of folder overs, but the BLT remains a favorite.  Don't overlook this small pizza joint - it's quality!"}
{"text":"Service was good, decent prices. But the pizza itself was very soggy, undercooked and too messy to eat."}
{"text":"The prices are above average and I don't mind paying when the pizza is good. Unfortunately it has been a pretty hit or miss experience since we moved here 2 years ago. About 1/3 of the time the crust is doughy and they can never find our house (we live on a corner but every other delivery service can find us)."}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA! Must always order the cheese stuffed crust. Also has a great menu of sandwiches and other bar style foods. Take out only. Not the best hours but again, GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"Stopped and ordered a couple pizzas on moving day and the owner took care of me! The pizza is excellent! Ordered it again and is now my favorite spot to order! So far we have tried: Taco pizza, Alfredo Za pizza and the typical pepperoni....all were delicious."}
{"text":"food is awesome! service is great,with pick up or delivery.No better in this area!"}
{"text":"Since they took out Pizza Dude, I have been frequenting Uncle Al's more and more and have discovered what is a very tasty pie. Their sauce is not overpowering and the cheese is plentiful. The toppings are great, especially the veggies which taste somewhat fresh. The subs are also a treat and big enough for two (or one hungry guy!). The mozz sticks are a good deal and the chicken wing sauces are flavorful. The prices are not always the best, but for a locally owned Pizza joint, Uncle Al's does pretty good for itself."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself wanting something different than a typical pizza for dinner in the Olmsted Falls area, I would highly suggest giving Uncle Al's Fold-over Pizzas a try.   While Uncle Al's has regular pizza, as well, I am basing this review solely on the fold-over variety.   The buffalo chicken fold-over is my favorite, but I also enjoy the Philly cheesesteak a lot. I often order these for work functions, and other people have raves about the BLT and Gyro fold-overs. I have yet to attempt the General Tso's Chicken one, but it's on my list!!"}
{"text":"Years ago (about 25 to be exact) I lived by Uncle Al's and my kids loved it, especially the taco foldover. Well, I happened to be driving by last week and felt nostalgic for one. I couldn't believe that they still have it and it was just as I remembered. I definitely need to come back more often than every 25 years. It is worth the drive. And please Uncle Al continue making that awesome taco foldover!"}
