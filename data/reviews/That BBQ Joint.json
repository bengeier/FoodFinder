{"text":"New location, same top quality. Finally made it in to the new place; had an Italian Beef with greens and baked beans, plus an order of fried okra. The Italian Beef is a slight variation on the Chicago standard--it's sliced brisket rather than shredded, stewed meat, but the flavors are amazing. I go back and forth between the hot and mild giard. Beans were good, mixed with little chunks of meat, collards were very lemony, which is slightly different than before, but no complaints from me.   The okra was amazing. Quickly deep-fried with a light cornmeal batter, tons of okra taste and even a little slime in the seeds (for the uninitiated, this is a very good thing).   One of my favorite places for a serious meal. It's a block from the bike path, so it's easy to pig out on BBQ and then go burn it off."}
{"text":"Pretty much a bad experience from moment we walked in the door. The person that took our order seemed annoyed that we were there. We came baesd on reviews that mentioned great service and bbq, we left having found neither. The sauces all tasted the same, just different colors. My husband's ribs were burnt as burnt can get and the sides of beans, coleslaw and brisket chili were either horrible tasting or tasteless. We truly had high hopes, again based on reviews. Bob's Bitchin in Dodgeville is totally worth the drive versus ever coming here again. None of us appreciated leaving smelling like we had rolled in the smoker either."}
{"text":"This place is quite simply a phenomenal addition to the Willy Street food scene, and to culinary wizardry throughout the Madison area in general. I had been driving past this joint ever since it opened in early October of 2013, always wondering if, just perhaps, incredible and inexpensive barbecue had finally made it's way to the 'hood. Well, it has, and it's glorious.  After just returning from a road trip around the Raleigh-Durham area and eating pulled pork at a variety of some of the country's more venerable establishments, I still have to say that the pulled pork at TBJ is the best I've had in recent memory. My bias certainly comes in the form of favoring midwestern barbecue (Memphis and KC style), but great is great, no matter which way you slice it.  As a previous reviewer said, the star of the show here certainly is the meats. They are perfectly rubbed, and while the three sauces that you can choose from are all awesome in their own right, the ribs just do not require any sauce. The heavy hand with brown sugar and maple smoke shines through terrifically. While I also enjoy the fall-off-the-bone style you can find at Smoky Jon's, purists will probably appreciate that this stuff has a little more bite to it, despite being perfectly tender.  As for that pork, it's loaded with delicious bark but also retains lots of moisture. The brioche-y bun was a perfect choice and meat-to-bread ratio was spot on. The touch of sliced pickles on the sandwich was nice, too.   But one of the things that most keeps me going back to a place is the attitude of the purveyors/staff, and that was almost as much of a draw here as the quality of the grub. Clement, who runs the joint with his mom, spent a good 20 minutes just chopping it up about barbecue with me. You can tell that this guy loves what he does and has a genuine enthusiasm for his food. When he noticed how enamored I was with the 'cue, he was quick to bring out a generous amount of free samples so that I really got a taste of the menu.  This is exactly the type of place that the neighborhood needs. I truly hope word of mouth gets around and this place gets the business and attention it deserves.   I should also reiterate that it's extremely inexpensive, which is a rarity in the Atwood area where even casual joints tend to overprice. If you want a sample of the menu but are short on loot, just get a snack of a few ribs (they serve them individually at $1.50 a piece) or a pulled pork sammy sans sides for $5.  Only criticism would be that the collards could use a bit more vinegar and ham hocks--they were fine, but just a little on the bland side. But yeah, it's about the meat here, and the meat is glorious. I will be telling everyone I know and returning quite often."}
{"text":"If you have ever watched House of Cards and thought Freddy's BBQ Joint looks really good, you should probably head down to That BBQ Joint. The Look and atmosphere are similar and if Freddy's was a real place, I'm sure That BBQ Joint would taste the same, if not better."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've tried this place.  The second time is not a charm, so there wont be a third!  The first was when they first opened. At that time, we tried to call in an order.  We were asked to hold while the employee tended to a customer.  The employee then proceeded to speak at length to the customer and ignore the fact that we were on hold.  Apparently they forgot about us.  We then drove direct to That BBQ Joint to put in our order.  It took a very long time. The ribs were sub-par.  Fast forward to tonight.  We thought we would give it one more shot since it has now been over a year.  Called in an order (2 orders of 1/2 rack ribs with greens and potato salad).  We were told 10 minutes.  Got there after 15 minutes of making the call.  Had to wait in a long line.  Finally to the counter and the order wasn't even ready.  They had to start preparing it.  Something that was to take 10 minutes took 25.  Unacceptable if someone is trying to call in an order.    Get home with the order and we recieve one 1/2 rack of ribs, not two and one order of brisket and a side of baked beans. The ribs continue to be in our opinions, sub-par.    We've learned our lesson and will never be going back."}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork sandwich- its my fav! Great BBQ, sauce, sides, and bottled beer options! I recommend trying it out if your in town!:)"}
{"text":"Today I had the TBJ House Special Sandwich for lunch. While eating I instagrammed two pictures about it and tweeted about it an obnoxious four times. This was the first sandwich of the rest of my life."}
{"text":"I have had the ribs a number of times and they have been consistently excellent. They are so good, I can't order any other meat. Hushpuppies are also excellent. They are moving a few blocks to a bigger place."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had, really! A nice selection of different sandwiches, and GREAT sides! Chili, jalapeno cornbread, sweet potato fries.. I could go on. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed. Their Italian Beef Sandwich with Hot Peppers is my favorite, but everything is good here. They have great service and they're always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in Madison. Perhaps the best BBQ I've ever had! You seriously need to check these guy's out!"}
{"text":"Finallyyyyyy......my hubby agreed to go and give this place a try, he always made an excuse saying it was too far, but since I pleased him by ordering his favorite food yesterday, today he could not say anything when I suggested this restaurant ;)   We ordered a full rack of ribs (they were big meaty slabs with a nice smoky flavor) and asked for the three sauces they offer, a sweet one, mustard and a spicy one (they were all very good!) for the sides we had the potato salad and the creamy cole slaw), they made a nice combo since the slaw was vinegary and sweet and the potato salad was savory. We got two dinner rolls and I loved those, nice and soft with a hint of honey. All what we ordered was more than enough for two people, I even brought some leftovers home.   In general, I liked it, the only downside I see is that the place is very small, today we were lucky since it is a holiday; Furthermore not many people were around."}
{"text":"First of all, this place looks like a hole in the wall type of restaurant from the outside...GET OVER IT!  Second, yes it may not be the classiest place to sit and eat, but what did you expect at a BBQ place, elegance???  GET OVER IT!  Yes, the bathroom is down the sidewalk and to the right...AGAIN GET OVER IT!  That BBQ Joint is a hidden treasure and if you have not been here, then what are you waiting for?  Let me attempt to explain my experience...  I saw it on Yelp and tried to confirm with some locals who apparently knew nothing of it, hence the reactions: \"BBQ here?  I think you are in the wrong part of the country\"  \"Well, there's Smokey Bones\" (no, let's not...) \"Hmm, That BBQ Joint? no never heard of it, must not be that good.\"    Needless to say That BBQ Joint is some of the best BBQ that I have had in a long time.  Here is a replay (I am getting hungry just thinking of the food) of my visit:  I actually was served by the owner Marlene and she is humble and very polite (a little too humble in my opinion).  Marlene you know the food is that good, dammit!!!! :)  The smoky ribs are meaty and can be eaten plain without sauce, they are that damn good.  The smoked chicken is moist and juicy and can also be eaten without adding any sauce.  The brisket chili is probably one of the most flavorful chili's I have ever eaten.  I was very surprised by the amount of brisket chucks in it.  Definitely recommend the brisket chili!!!  The baked beans are good and the coleslaw was also fresh, light and tasty.  The sweet potato fires were fresh, light and oh so tasty!  The best sweet potato fries I have ever had!   As for the sauces, the spicy BBQ sauce, thank God, is not a Tabasco-induced mess.  It is, however, a very intense and surprisingly good tasting, herbal blended sauce with a kick.  The regular BBQ sauce is also very tasty if you do not like hot or spicy flavors.  I tasted the mustard BBQ sauce, and though not my cup-o-tea, was good too.  Now here is where I am a little upset with Marlene.  I asked her if the sweet potato pie was good and she advised me that \"she liked it.\"  Marlene you need to stop playing with us and tell us the truth!  It is some of the best and most tastiest sweet potato pie I have eaten.  It was the right amount of sweet mixed with the perfect amount of consistency.  Stop being so damn humble Marlene and admit it...you make the bomb-ass sweet potato pie!!!!  My only regret is that I didn't start eating the pie until I was half-way home to Chicago and after my wife had already eaten most of it.  I almost had to pull a u-turn and go back for more.  Had I known it was that damn good, I would have purchased a whole pie!   Damn you Marlene, why did u have to play with my taste buds like that?????  I do not know if I will ever be back to Madison, but it is a very lovely place.  I do know that if and when I do come back, That BBQ Joint is the first stop I will go!  I do not know how others are rating this place less than 5 stars, but the food is worth it, the services is great and the place is simple and homey, just what a small, hole-in-the-wall BBQ joint should be.  Many thanks and best wishes to Marlene and the That BBQ Joint Crew for ending our visit to Madison with a bang!!!"}
{"text":"Okay. I KNOW I've already rated and posted. But DEAR GOD. Dear goodness gracious.  The smoky brown sugar bark on the ribs.  The glazy dark chewy-crisp skin on the wings.   The ethereal coating on the sweet potato fries.  The dirty feeling one experiences upon the first bite into a gigantic deep-fried panko-crusted macaroni and cheese ball.    Pure culinary debauchery."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for takeout or a casual dinner. Definitely the best BBQ I've had in the city. I get the pulled pork with sweet potato fries; both are delicious, as is their sweet potato pie. I'd definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"By far the best and most authentic BBQ I have tried in Madison.  Delicious, moist and freshly cooked on site.   The people there are very friendly and know their barbecue!"}
{"text":"Call early ( noon- 1:00pm) to place a carry out order so you won't be disappointed! They sell out early. Ribs and chicken are wonderfu! Both slaws are good too."}
{"text":"I love that bbq joint.  We've made it a weekly tradition every Wednesday and I sneak in once a week or so more as it's the best!  My favorite is the smoked wings, but everything I've had is amazing- the ribs, the half chicken, the rib tubs as well as the brisket and pulled pork.  All the sides are super, I like the creamy slaw, brisket chili and collards best.  Try the jalapeños hush puppies as well, they are amazing.  Make sure you check the hours as they are closed Monday Tuesday and close down for lunch midday as well."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food at a very good price. The meat is carefully prepared, the sauces are original and skillfully crafted. Their pulled pork and BBQ ribs have the hearty integrity you crave while still offering a taste that is surprising. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered a pulled pork sandwich on Sunday and got food poisoning from it - it was my first time eating at That BBQ Joint it will definitely be my last."}
{"text":"Good BBQ in Madison?  Yep!  Felt like I was in Texas.    Ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with the chili and baked beans.  The sandwich was excellent with a good smokey crust yet very tender.  Good smoke taste.    Had a couple chicken wings on the side and those were probably the highlight of the meal.  Crunchy on the outside, smokey and salty flavor, and very tender meat.  Delicious!  The BBQ sauces were good but nothing to go crazy about.    Yes, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"My first trip warrants a return.  I'll be bringing lunch for coworkers next time.  I picked up the brisket sandwich entree.  The meat was tender, on a good bun, and complemented well by the spicy sauce (a tasty \"Wisconsin spicy\" vinegar sauce).    The baked beans were savory, and surprisingly spicy.  The beans were excellent (still a bit firm), and there was plenty of pork in the mix.  I opted for the mayo-based coleslaw, which was decent.  Plan on getting takeout, as seating is limited to twelve stools (three tables for two along the windows, two counters with three stools each along the walls)."}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in the wall BBQ place. The meats are all pretty good with a great smoke flavor on them. Ribs are a little small but are done well. Pulled pork was good. Their sauces are average at best which is disappointing, thankfully their meat has good flavor and are pretty moist. The service isn't the best and the costs are a little high for what you get but it's still 3 stars because of the good smoke flavor they get."}
{"text":"The food was not great. Chicken salad was good. Quality meat and flavor was good. Liked that it had cranberry and walnuts. The fries were absolutely terrible. Cold and white looking. Mac and cheese ball had no flavor. Coleslaw had a fishy taste. They have four main entrees and were out of one, chicken. Ribs were meaty but salty. Baked beans were good. Very disappointed since it is on Willy St and there is such high quality, local food all around it."}
{"text":"That Bbq Joint is my Happy Place Madison Bbq Sublime  The people are knowledgeable, patient and upbeat. The food is authentic Southern Bbq Thus far I have quality tested: (and not been left wanting- for anything but MORE) Half and whole slab Ribs = tender, juicy, seasoned to perfection and smoky Sides: hush puppies = golden fried balls of cornbread deliciousness + jalepenos             Greens = as if your Gma- if your Gma is a Southern Gma- prepared these and added all the love. Rich and satisfying             Cole Slaw = two styles, creamy and vinegar- both fresh, crispy and bright              Okra = like winning the lottery- if you get to taste this. Sells Out! Now people, this is the cherry on top, Sweet Potato Pie. You MUST try this pie. I know you do not have room for dessert I know. The portions are generous and you are full now. Later, tonight or tomorrow, you WILL want the Sweet Potato Pie- Would I steer you wrong?"}
{"text":"Found this place last week and went Friday night. They were sold out of pork, brisket, and ribs. Bummer. But as they say, if a place is sold out of something, that is usually a good sign. We tried the rib tips and smoked chicken wings. Both were excellent but the wings might be the best I've ever had. Crunchy and Smokey but the meat was so tender and flavorful. We went back Saturday afternoon to try the trifecta of BBQ and it didn't disappoint. They gave us some free rib tips with out pork, brisket and ribs. Meats are served dry and they don't need sauce but they do have 3 homemade sauces. All was truly delicious. I like to make my own BBQ and it usually turns out quite good, but this place outdoes me. My new fav place in Madison. The spot is very small and not conducive to family seating. Parking is also challenging in this neighborhood. But that is ok cause the food is all worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped in this week and could not have been more pleased! They were out of brisket (it was just before closing) so we got some ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were surprisingly good! Not Central Texas great, not St. Louis great, but great for Wisconsin. I'll take it!  They weren't the meatiest ribs ever, but they had great flavor and they were perfectly tender and moist. Delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was also very good, with a very large portion of pork and lots of bark. All three bbq sauces (spicy, mustard, and sweet) were distinct and flavorful. I thought the sweet sauce was best with the ribs. The sides were fine. The brisket chili was spicy with lots of meat. The potatoes in the potato salad were slightly undercooked but it was ok. The collard greens, while not the best we've had, were still nice and tender. During our meal the owner came out and asked if we needed anything, which was thoughtful. I've had bbq all over and I'm pleased to know that when I've got the craving That BBQ Joint will be there for me. These folks deserve some praise for cranking out some really good 'Que!"}
{"text":"I have stopped ordering BBQ when i eat anywhere else but THAT BBQ.  When I'm on my way to grab BBQ from this place I can already taste the juiciness.  Recently ate the Pan Seared Brisket that had a great char and chewy texture.  EAT HERE NOW!"}
{"text":"I'm a native Texan and have had the pleasure of eating at some of the best BBQ joints out there. I haven't yet found a place in Madison that serves decent que and stumbled upon That BBQ Joint's high praise on Yelp. I decided to give That BBQ Joint a shot and ended up having one of the worst meals of my life.  I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, and a 1/2 lb of brisket, hoping that one or more options would pan out.   The ribs: These were the worst ribs I've ever had. They had a sweet sauce that was palatable but were so tough and overcooked that they were virtually inedible. There was zero bark, no smoke ring, and not an ounce of meat that was tender. Very disappointing.  The brisket: I'm still dumbfounded by what I was served. The 1/2 lb of brisket was shaved deli thin and served in a plastic container. It had a gelatinous film on top which was an obvious indication that the brisket hadn't been smoked that day. The flavor was devoid of smoke, bark, and didn't really taste like beef. It was truly an insult to BBQ.  The pulled pork: This was the lone 'bright spot'. The pork was tender and the sauce pairings made the sandwich okay. Still no bark and very little smoke.  When you couple the complete disaster of a meal with the fact that the management placed signage in the restaurant that bragged about their electric smokers and made light of those that make BBQ the traditional way with stick burners, it's very evident to me that this group hasn't quite figured out what BBQ is and how to make it properly.  I think my biggest question is to the Yelpers who have given this place such high praise. Is it the chicken wings that make That BBQ Joint awesome? Or the mac and cheese balls? Because it definitely isn't the BBQ."}
{"text":"One of the very few legitimate bbq places. Their sauces are really good too. Ribs and rib tips are both good and not overcooked.  Be sure to get the sides as well."}
{"text":"I always appreciate a good bbq place on the east side so I'm giving this place 4 stars. But, maybe 3.5 is more appropriate. I like the location. I like the decor. And I like the people that work there. The amount of food for the price was appreciated but I have a few issues.   First, the hot bbq sauce was adequately spicy but has way too much cinnamon or cardamom in it. They should definitely dial that back a bit, or a lot.   Second, the rib tips are cut too short and it seems like they are cut from some pretty lean cows because there is very little fat on them. I'm not sure if this is a cost or preference issue but as a lover of rib tips, these just don't make the cut. I will continue ordering them because they give a decent amount, but if you're looking for meaty, fatty, delicious rib tips....these will not suffice.   Finally, if you're not cooking your collard greens in ham hock and smothering them in vinegar pepper sauce...I really don't see the point. Multiple places in madison serve collard greens as a vegetarian option, and as a southerner I find this to be sacrilegious.  It seems the demands of the vegetarians have ruined this  southern specialty and it's a damn shame. Let them have their slaw and potato salad...but don't take the ham out of the greens. Also, I was assured by one of the employees that the pepper vinegar sauce had been lost or spoiled in the move, so I can't speak to whether it is there now. But he assured me it would be in the future.   Not \"that bbq joint\" quite yet...."}
{"text":"Delicious ribs and pulled pork. Great service and free refills of homemade iced tea.  Not very expensive for what you get.  I will definitely go back again. Cute interior. Limited seating but it seemed like most people got takeaway.  Must try."}
{"text":"This is some of the best BBQ we have ever had.  Ribs were fall off the bone tender and moist, nice and smokey.  Choice of sauces at the table--all were delicious--none of the overly sweet syrupy sauce variety.  These were tangy and well-balanced.  Very little seating in the restaurant, and you do have to get there early as they start to run out of items.  Prices are reasonable.  Absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't let the entrance detour you. Many a food lover could tell that the best places are often the least presumptuous.   I swung by and was able to feast on a bot of everything: ribs, smoked chicken, chicken wings with the honey glaze, fried mac and cheese ball, greens, brisket chili, beans, and potatoe salad.  While most of the food was good the ribs were incredible. You guys do a great great job. Everyone must try their ribs. Ill be back for a whole rack, and a pound of wings for good measure. I'm hungry now..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the fried chicken I had today, but be warned that it's a Saturday-only item.  The barbecue was like a lot of what I've encountered around here in that the smoke flavor's pretty light, but that's not unexpected considering there's no real tradition in this part of the country and barbecue's value seems to be tied more closely to sauce than smoke.  And barbecue restaurants gotta sell what people will eat in order to stay in business, so take that for what it's worth.  Regarding an earlier review, rib tips don't usually come from \"cows\" unless they're specifically described as beef (and at TBJ they're not).  They come from pigs.  And most beef comes from steers, as cows provide a greater return on investment by living longer and often wind up as hamburger when their days are done.  ;^)"}
{"text":"Just incredible. If the Cubano is a special on the day you visit, GET IT. If it's not, get the rib tips, the rueben, the pork sandwich, the 1/2 chicken, the baked beans, etc. You get the picture. The sweet potato fries are the best I've had in the city. Service was outstanding today, per usual. You'll leave smelling like you've been to a bonfire, but anyone who hates that smell is a monster. I'll come back over and over again. This business deserves your support in light of the neighborhood controversy."}
{"text":"I LOVED the food at the old place.  The new place? No clue.  I went there at 6:15 on a Saturday night, and they were sold OUT of pulled pork, smoked chicken, ribs, and brisket, leaving pretty much chicken salad.   You cant have a BBQ restaurant without BBQ. Sorry guys. I'd be happy to amend this review if they can figure out how to actually have food to serve."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and holy crap. Get their wings and ribs! Absolutely amazing. Highly recommend the habanero and chili sauces for the wings. Will be here again for sure."}
{"text":"Our search for good BBQ in the Madison area continues. For those with a nav system in their car, please note that they seem to have moved to a new location on Williamson in the past year?  While there was nothing compelling about the food we enjoyed our meal. Wife had the ribs. I had the brisket but was disappointed that it is only offered as a sandwich or by the pound as carry out. She wasn't too interested in her sides. I ordered the hush puppies. We both enjoyed the banana pudding.  The downside was the relatively long wait for our food and as closing time neared their available menu items diminished significantly."}
{"text":"Worst rib I ever had. Have been to two smoke house in at.louis. Both use wood. However, I guess they use charcoal instead of wood to cook. The rib smells horrible and the color is black."}
{"text":"So I'm an Okie far from Muskogee, and finding (good) BBQ in Wisco is like looking for the Holy Grail. I'd heard about TBBQJ, but everytime I'm near, I can't smell the smoke. So I never really trusted it. Today I gave in and decided to add another conquest to the BBQ list. I haven't found the Grail yet, but TBBQJ is \"good enuf\" for my fix.  They lean more to the Memphis style BBQ. I'm not sure why people here are getting the sandwiches... GET THE PORK RIBS! And the CHICKEN. You are missing out.  Pork Ribs - I got the 3 bone (which was 3.5!). Meat was: moist, tender, heavily seasoned with salt and sugar, great smoke ring, with medium-heavy smoke flavor. They use hickory logs and the inside of this place was wafting with a nice smoke smell. (You WILL smell like BBQ after eating here!) I was pleasantly surprised by the whole rib experience. They use a basic sugar + salt \"dry\" rub, but they let it reduce to a \"moist\" quality (check pic). I could feel sugar crystals bursting between my teeth! And then they combat it with a heavy dose of salt/seasoning. The third ingredient, and where other Madison joints are failing, is they know how to layer-in their smoke flavor. And they know when to take it off the fire to keep a nice smoke ring and external crunchy bite. The fat in these ribs is liquified into a nice addition (instead of greasy distraction like other more dry ribs). To the basic eater, ribs are just ribs. But these guys know there are many moving parts and they handled it well on the day I was there. 4/5  Chicken - same thing. It's rare to find a place that knows the difference between a tough meat rib and a tender meat on the bone. TBBQJ does AND treats BOTH with respect; for that, I respect them. Meat was heavy seasoned + heavy smoke, but remained juicy and hot. SECOND place for Chicken on BBQ list. 4.5/5  Okra - Oh finally. I miss me some okra. Even though it's not made from scratch, they still fry it good, and I haven't found anyone else near here that knows how to do it.5/5  Creamy Slaw - was actually dry. I would have liked a little more mayo to make it \"wet\" and/or \"creamy.\" But it was still a nice palate cleanser. 3/5  Collard Greens - a-ok. Not the best; not the worst. Surprised they didn't add ham, nor any meat, but that's nice for the vegetarians. Noticed a little vinegar and a hint of Louisiana/Franks/Crystal sauce. 3/5  Sauces - I judge a BBQ based on the flavor of their meat WITHOUT sauce. If you HAVE to sauce it, I don't trust you as a pitmaster. BUT their sauces were good. They have 3: 2 tomato based (one hickory/sweet/tangy + one spicy: allspice + chili? + habanero?) and one mustard-vinegar based. I had eaten all my ribs, so I tried these with my okra. They were each a fun little different thing.  Overall, these pitmasters are still fresh and know what they are doing. I appreciated the \"dry\" rub and Memphis style simple flavors. I would prefer a little less salt, but generally, I like 'em. 4/5"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place because we're desperate for good BBQ (transplants from the South and Kansas City).  Unfortunately this won't be a keeper for us.   The beef brisket sandwich was generous in proportion, but relatively flavorless.  Hubby asked for his with no pickle but it still came with pickle.  The ribs were meaty, but again - barbecue is all about the smoked meat, not sauces.  There wasn't much complexity of flavor.  The fries were, frankly, terrible.  They were hot and there were lots of them, but were the color and texture of a raw potato. The sauces were ok, but the dispenser bottles are awful - if they have to warn you about squeezing them, then there's a serious design problem there.  Hubby had one in his hand, not even squeezing it, and it erupted all over the table, nearly hitting the table next to us.  The potato salad, on the other hand, was delicious.  We wish them well but won't be back."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places in Madison - the most authentic barbecue I've had in the Midwest, coupled with a friendly and welcoming staff, keeps me coming back on an almost weekly basis. It feels like a down-south barbecue joint run by a woman named Doris and her four grandkids. It doesn't need any frills because the food speaks for itself, and it feels remarkably endearing when you take a seat and open a beer."}
{"text":"That creole chicken sandwich tho...  Amazing! Fried okra, smoked chicken wings, and amazing bbq sauce galore? That BBQ Joint has just made this Texan feel right at home."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on this place so I thought I would give it a try.  If you like real BBQ that is actually slow smoked this is the place.  I tried the ribs, chicken wings and pulled pork sandwich.  All of them had a great smokey flavor.  The ribs were very meaty.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite bbq was Don & GGs in Ironwood, MI (and it is still worth the 5 hour drive from Madison); however, they only have ribs. That BBQ Joint is the  best and most versatile. I've tried the ribs, brisket, whole chicken, and some special items. Tonight, it was the signature sandwich, TBJ, along with the Italian Beef and Chicken Wings. All three were superb. The wings were smoked to perfection and needed nothing but the rub. The TBJ is a version of the Cuban and the homemade mustard sauce mixed perfectly with with the meats--the panini bread was crisp and added to the overall texture. The Italian Beef (I went with mild peppers) was incredible. Perhaps the best roast beef that I have ever tasted. The bread stood up to the au jus so that utensils were not needed.   For the mainstays, the homemade sauces are incredible, but try the food without the sauce first just to allow the rub to shine.  The sides are all well done as I have had them, but the meats are the stars. Pricing is very fair and reasonable and you can sample with single ribs and chicken wings. A great addition to the neighborhood and Madison's food scene."}
{"text":"One word...DELICIOUS!   If you want some home cooking -- stop here! They seem to have someone irregular hours and when they run out for the day of an item, it's gone. However, the food just kicks but. My brisket sandwich with hush puppies was out of this world. My boyfriend enjoyed his ribs (meat falling off the bone) and pork beans.   Prepare yourself, for an extremely casual environment, and i think you can only park on Willy.   Come here, than stop at WISCO for a pitcher. It made for a great date night for us!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the smokey flavors of everything we got. We ordered wings and a ribs sandwich(Wednesday special). Food came out really fast. They also had good selection of bbq sauces. It's definitely a smaller space so not the best for a big group but in that case, they do carry out."}
{"text":"It's bbq time. We did lunch here just as they opened and people were already lined up. The place isn't much to look at and is very small with three tables and two counters on the wall. The restroom is out the door and down the side of the building to the next side door was weird.    We place our order and in about five minutes the food was on the table, see the pictures. We were going to America on tap 2015 so I had the three rib basket so as to not really get filled up. See the pictures. May sides were greens and the brisket chili.    The food looked and smelled amazing. First off the the ribs looked fresh and moist with that smoke ring. Look at the shiny outer part of the rib, there rubbed with something. The greens and chili looked good also. I took my first bight and noticed that smokey flavor that I love and the rub was enough to do the job. They don't sauce the ribs and I didn't need any because they tasted good. The texture of the meat was just how I like it, not mushy and just the right chew. The meat came clean off the bone. The ribs were moist and not dry like a lot of places and might have been made that day. The brisket chili was good and strange because it was waterless, like a thick stew. Here where it all comes crashing down, the greens were the worst part of the meal. They were not seasoned or flavored with anything. Throw them in boiling water and serve them.  Over all I like the food and the greens were not enough to bring down the review. The ribs were good and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Hidden in between the Willy street and Atwood area is this awesome new BBQ place that even a southerner (my friend) has great praises for!   Cheap, delicious comfort food - that's what you're looking at in That BBQ joint. There is no official sign, the name is spray paint on the windows, but yes, they are OPEN!! Tips from regulars is to call ahead, maybe before dinner, to make sure you get the items you want.   By the time I came to collect my order at 6:30pm, the brisket and ribs are already SOLD OUT, and pies were gone too :( Also, calling ahead reduces the wait, there were maybe 8 to 10 people waiting for their orders when I went in and got my order within 5 minutes.   What to get? Rib half slab - the rib basket only has 3 ribs, even me tiny eater is craving and asking for more.. The sauce is kind sweet and tangy. I love the chewy and tender texture of the ribs. Favorite so far. Boyfriend thinks it could be more moist  Pulled pork - it's a SANDWICH. wasn't clear from the menu.. comes with sweet and tangy sauce too. be generous and pour all of it on the meat. Good flavor, but some parts without sauce could be dry. Creamy slaw - some raisins, good tasty slaw Baked beans - decent. a little sweet Collard greens - just boiled veggies   I'm looking forward for my next excuse to get some ribs. mmm mmm. convenient and delicious! Just remember to call ahead!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been craving good barbecue since coming back from our recent trip to Austin, and decided to check this restaurant out. It is a smaller restaurant and seemed to be quite popular. We were there around 5:00pm on a Sunday at the tail end of Black Restaurant Week.  A few of the items on their menu like the brisket and rib tips were sold out by the time we got there, which is understandable after what I assume was a very busy week for them. Even though we weren't able to order our favorites, my husband and I were able to find other items on the menu that we would enjoy. I ordered the ribs and my husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich.   The ribs were so tender the meat was just falling off of the bone and practically melted in your mouth. They were incredible. My husband's sandwich was just as delicious. The sides we ordered were wonderful as well. I had the creamy slaw and baked beans, and my husband also had the beans. Each one was delicious. Even the dinner roll that came with our meal tasted homemade!  Towards the end of our meal the man who took our order brought out some hush puppies for us and the table next to us to try, for free! They were jalapeno hush puppies and had a really great jalapeno flavor without the uncomfortable spiciness that can sometimes come with jalapenos. We were so impressed with our meal and the service, and we can't wait to come back and try the brisket and rib tips! If you are planning on eating here I would suggest arriving earlier rather than later, but honestly no matter what you order off of the menu I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner yesterday and the Italian Beef Sandwich was so good.  Great flavor."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long? I can't look back but now the future seems just a bit brighter.  It was beautiful evening. Spring at its best. I was driving down Willy St and I heard the Siren's call. BBQ take out was in order. I called a friend who eats little meat. She immediately jumped at the idea of trying the chicken. I, of course, was headed for the ribs. The Muslim boyfriend was elsewhere so pork was calling my name.   I had the 3 rib dinner with greens and baked beans. My friend had the half chicken with greens and vinegar slaw. The only disappointing item were the greens. Neither of us liked them and both of us usually love them. That said, the rest of the meal was spectacular. My ribs were perfectly cooked, no fat to be seen, tender and oh so flavorful. The chicken was moist and seasoned well. The skin was a beautiful mahogany color and the meat fell off the bone. The baked beans and slaw complemented the meats. Couldn't have been better.  To top it off, we dined al fresco on my little condo porch. Perfect!  It appears that this establishment is moving but I don't know where it is going. If you do, send me a message. I can only hope they stay in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Don't tell my wife I came here again.  She'll be jealous.  The only other time I looked this happy was, well, you get the picture.  Ribs with the Mo' Mustard sauce, brisket chile, slaw. How is this not illegal? ?"}
{"text":"One of, if not the best place in Madison to get BBQ. I go every few weeks and have tried most of the menu . I would highly recommend the ribs or the Italian beef brisket.  All the sides I have tried are delicious, especially the fried okra. Would recommend for anyone looking for barbecue in Madison. Note that the hours are limited, so make sure to check them before you head over for BBQ"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ place in Madison. We had the chicken wings, pulled pork and brisket. All 3 meats were mouth watering and amazing. For sides we had baked beans, greens and deep fried corn. Those three were also very good. We got there a little late so will be back for the rib tips, whole chicken and the ribs next.The meats are so good you don't even need the sauce. From here on out I will not eat any other BBQ. If you want Real BBQ this is the place. Don't really understand the issues about the bathroom and size of the dinning area?? I don't really think it matters, because the food is so awesome. So please don't pass this place up its a hidden gem. And if you don't like smoked meats this is not a place for you."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I had the rib sandwich which blew me away. The fries were crinkle cut fries with just the right amount of salt. The best part was the lemonade. I have a thing for good lemonade and their house made lemonade was amazing."}
{"text":"Ohhhh BBQ!  This place is AWESOME. The food is very tasty. Both of the times that I have ordered I have had their baby back ribs. The meat is SO tender, and the rub they use is great.  I really like their original bbq sauce and really like the mustard sauce for dipping.  Their sweet potato fries are great. The coleslaw is a pretty basic creamy coleslaw. The second time I ordered I tried the fried corn bread - didn't really care for them (very dry). I wasn't able to try their collard greens because they were sold out. It seems as though they sell out of a lot of their menu items which can be a little frustrating. For BBQ, I feel the prices are very reasonable.  Looking forward to try other cuts of meat.  I would have to say this is the best BBQ I have had in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq joint. Best in Madison. The ribs were very tender and came off the bone neatly. The pulled pork sandwich was also very good. It came out dry without sauce and certainly needed sauce to moisten it up but the flavor was delicious. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is great but it is illegal to add 15% to phone in credit card orders and who would ever pay that?"}
{"text":"They do sell out of items on a regular basis.  Call ahead if your looking for something particular.  We had two different types of chicken.  The 1/2 chicken had some spices that were more fiery than the wings.  Really not sure if I'll give this place another go since the spices weren't what we were looking for when it comes to BBQ."}
{"text":"Im not some bbq nerd that waxes poetically about that one time in Texas. This place is delicious. Great bbq in Madison."}
{"text":"I was looking for actual southern food, they had the food, but not the taste. The customer service was good, the food came in a timely manner, but the food wasn't as good as I had thought and heard it was. Ribs were cooked well. Greens were vinegar filled, beans were too tangy. Good customer service, not as good of food. Will try again though."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The staff is really nice and helpful. The ribs were tender and tasty and they have a delicious side order of chili available. The chicken was okay but unfortunately a little bit dry. They were, unfortunately, out of brisket when we went here which seems to be a fairly regular occurrence. I was pretty close to giving it 4 stars and am hopeful for a good brisket the next time I go back."}
{"text":"The ribs here are AMAZINGGGGG.  I really liked the sides too, especially their potato salad.  We also had the pork belly burger and chicken wings which were also pretty good, but the ribs were hands down the best."}
{"text":"Staff was polite and friendly! Food was decent but overpriced for the portions they were giving. Choices of sauce were not the best, you either got spicy, super spicy or mustard spicy. The meat was over cooked and very dry. The cole slaw was excellent though would recommend that for sure. Overall I was a little disappointed with the food, as it was not up to par with the ratings I have seen for this place. I would go back again but only of I was in the neighborhood, I don't plan on actively seeking this place out..."}
{"text":"Great staff, nice to have a family owned bbq joint to go to. Food is always excellent."}
{"text":"Yes!!! Smells amazing, food delicious, cool ass staff.  I don't eat meat and they have the most amazing sides, and yes even a veg BBQ sandwich. So why do I give them 5 stars when I didn't eat the meat? Great staff, great vibe, and all around good food."}
{"text":"I'd give three stars or maybe two for sides, they need work, but I'd give five stars for the meats- excellent.    Had ribs on visit and brisket on another and loved both. But seriously improve the sides, then I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly. Was in the neighborhood and still searching for a go to barbecue restaurant.  Pleasantly surprised.  Ribs were solid. Sides good. Small establishment. With no clear best of, I would make this part of the rotation. Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Assuming that you aren't deterred by Willy street parking this is a must try place. If you love bbq then you might as well look for a closer place to live. Went with my Dad and half the time that we were there he talked about what else he wants to try there. Had the Italian beef brisket with hot peppers and was in heaven! Hot peppers just hot enough to get the nose running and the au jus was superb! Easy , relaxed place with fair prices. Just smelling the air made me hungry. Definite must for a return visit."}
{"text":"FIVE Stars for the most amazing smoked Corned Beef Sandwich I have ever had! Truly! The sides are great too-- . Downside are the hours and early closing times..No frills.no atmosphere-- Just great corned beef!"}
{"text":"Went expecting Texas style BBQ and was a bit disappointed.  Only sandwiches and by the pound. A pound of brisket is very expensive! $23, so I went with the sandwich with sliced brisket.  Texas style is where you also have a plate with 1, 2, or 3 types of meet and a couple of sides.  The brisket was sliced ultra thin, which you DONT do with brisket unless you are masking a tough cut of brisket.   The smoking is mild but pleasant.  I prefer a strong smoking.  BBQ sauces are excellent.   I asked for pecan pie and they were all out.  Tried the sweet potato pie and it was ok.  Overall not good enough to make a trip back."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Madison. Beef brisket is flavorful and ribs are just fantastic. They sell out quick so I just putting in your order early. I hope they get enough business to start making more if everything! Sweet tea is refreshing too :)"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, friendly staff, a great place! The wings, pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and Rueben are our favorites, but it's ALL good. You can't go wrong here. The BBQ sauces made in-house take the meal to the next level of deliciousness. Extra attention has gone into the sides (not just thrown in as an after thought) and the vinegar slaw with the baked beans are my favorite. Throw in an ice cold Spotted Cow or Modelo and you're in heaven."}
{"text":"I grew up on Tennessee BBQ.  The place I went to was called \"Ott's BBQ\" - a cinder block building in the town of Dixie-Lee Junction - no lie!  Hickory smoked with vinegar based sauce and cole slaw.  I have now found an equal. TBJ is the place!  I have tried the ribs, pulled pork and chicken.  All are sublime.  The sides are dead on as well.  I could pick apart some nits here and there but forget it.  The ribs stopped me cold and left me speachless.  The pulled pork sandwich is worth it even for the bun (my old place in TN used hambuger buns - but grilled them).  The vinegar slaw is not like I am used to but super with the jalapeno added.  The chicken is not dry.  I am sorry I don't live closer.  The Carolina sauce is a bit heavy on the yellow - I'd prefer more vinegar. I also think the Carib sauce needs more heat.  Details.  The place rocks."}
{"text":"Way better than smoky jons....but out of ribs at 5:00? Come on guys get your timing better!"}
{"text":"That BBQ Joint is by far the best BBQ in Madison. Smoky Jon's is comparable, but no one can beat That BBQ Joint in service and deliciousness. Everyone who works there (it seems to be a small staff) is incredibly friendly and dedicated to serving delicious BBQ. I've never had a bad experience, and I've tried a range of items on their menu. The half chicken is delicious, the pulled pork is out of this world, and so is the brisket! Their ribs are insanely good as well. All of their sauces are amazing and made from scratch, so that's pretty fantastic as well. So much love for this place."}
{"text":"I have traveled quite a bit and BBQ is one of my fav types of food so was hopeful that I could find quality in Madison. The search continues.  I ordered for my family: brisket sandwich, rib tips, 1/2 chicken and hush puppies. Sides were chili, baked beans and coke slaw.   Brisket was paper thin and flavorless. Never seen paper thin brisket...probably will never see it again. Chicken was good. Rib tips were decent.   Where is the corn bread? I didn't get any or see any. That makes about as much sense as paper thin brisket.     Hush puppies were dull, chili was different but more sweet than savory. (I prefer savory) did not try the slaw or beans.   They have very left leaning political messages placed all over the place...maybe that makes it better for some, worse for others...I don't really care but found it odd in a retail environment being told that greed = evil. (You'd think they'd have low prices then huh? Nope.) I paid $40 and got 3 smallish meals with very tiny sides and no corn bread. For BBQ the portions are definitely light."}
{"text":"New location is great! Doesn't hurt it is only a block from my house too :)   Of course they are gonna run out of some stuff on a Saturday, they just re-opened. Can't hold that against them at all, instead should be happy for their success! At least that's the way I look at it.  To the food: love their wings. Recently tried the Italian beef and it's everything you could ever want in an Italian beef sandwich. Moist, flavorful and delicious. Au jous makes it.   Sides I always go with creamy slaw, baked beans or brisket chili but don't think you can go wrong.  Can't wait to keep trying things. Yay to BBQ!"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed. I tried the fish fry tonight, which was catfish and I loved it. French fries. Hush puppies ,creamy coleslaw, and two pieces of fish for 13 bucks?! Sweet!! I had the rib sandwich for lunch as well, amazing and way too much food for lunch. Tonight I noticed a TV, and asked about football, the girl was not sure but said if we asked they would probably turn on a game. Pretty nice. I have to say, I only order carry out because I live nearby so I don't have much to say about atmosphere, but employees are nice"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was fantastic, and with the barbecue sauce on the side (available at a counter in the next room), I didn't feel confined by someone else's definition of \"drowned in barbecue sauce.\" (Their sauce is excellent btw.) Additionally, their sweet potato fries are bomb dot com. So crispy! Comfort/summer food at its finest.   I need a nap now."}
{"text":"Went back once again and think the place has finally found it's pace. The sandwich I had, had less meat than before which was more in line with the good bun. The sauce was really good and the coleslaw much better than before. The counter dude was helpful and efficient and all went well with no problems. Not a lot of seating but we found a spot and had a beer while we waited. A great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Cool place but on this day I got a rack of ribs that were so salty i could not eat them and had to take them back. Judging by the reaction of the personal there this has never happened before and they didn't quite know what to do with me. I finally got an exchange for some pulled pork because I didn't want to chance more salt ribs and the pork was very good. This place really is a hole in the wall and there is no warm and fuzzy feel here at all like some BBQ places. There is no way of knowing how big this place really is because there is just a cash register in one corner and a room the size of a waiting room with three small tables. I wish they had a window into the kitchen where you could see how they prepare the food. Where is the smoker? It's a residential neighbor hood but there is no smoke smell outside at all.  We did try their brisket and felt that was the best of what we got. I would go back there for that but not sure if I would get ribs again. Maybe a three rib lunch just to see if the salt thing was a one time mistake or just how they do them. It's a dry rub on the ribs but usually not salty to this extent. The East side needs more places to eat but they have to have a good product all of the time. Fat Jacks has been doing it for decades and I have never taken anything back there."}
{"text":"My favorite food in Madison. Bar none. Everything I've tried has been great... my favorite sandwich is the Italian beef with mild peppers (the hot ones will crack your skull a little). It comes au jus... but I still add dashes of their signature BBQ sauces -- harkening to various BBQ hotspots around the nation -- mustard-y, spicy, sweet.... specials are wonderful, too... their pork tacos, for example, are indescribably delicious, because there's an American BBQ twist. Reuben? Amazing. The smokiest wings I've tried. But I first fell for their smoked chicken salad (I get a pound as takeout sometimes... makes great lunches... and a hearty dip for guests, too. Tonight I tried the fish fry special... and the cornmeal-crust catfish was done perfectly. The tartar sauce -- their own interpretation -- is something you need to taste. The gods smiled, when That BBQ Joint moved down Willy nearer to me."}
{"text":"I try to patronize local businesses especially minority owned ones as this one is. The food is good, reasonably priced and the services adequate. The sides were very home madeish. I was offended by the political bumper stickers and all of the wall art. It seems to be a recipie for failure in that the owner only wants to get a piece of 50% of the pie. Why not have a pleasant dining space which unites? An environment to galvanize us as a people with common tastes? Sorry I don't need any more opinions while I enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Food at That BBQ Joint is truly excellent. Their creamy slaw is crisp and tangy, hush puppies are perfectly spiced, and fries are salty goodness. I got the Friday fish fry, but it was really a tough choice, because everything on the menu looks amazing and the restaurant smells like saucy heaven. I loved the cornmeal breading on the fish, and my bf thought the fried chicken sandwich was juicy and excellent. This seems like a place you should visit repeatedly, because you will probably want to order the entire menu."}
{"text":"Very good, for Madison. Dosn't hold a candle to BBQ in the south.   I particularly like the brisket, and that the business is black owned.   Ignore low reviews from racist vegan NIMBYs who are angry about the smell. That's what they get for living next to a restaurant corridor."}
{"text":"This is a solid neighborhood place run by people who put great thought and care into the food they produce. The ribs are fantastic, and the beans are my go-to side. I'm also a huge fan of the hush puppies and chicken wings. I'm not sure if they've recently changed the hush puppies but they tasted even better than I remembered on a recent trip. The pulled pork isn't my all time favorite, but everything on the menu remains a great deal for the price point. I'm bummed out to see that neighbors are threatening them with bogus claims that the smell of their smokers is some sort of a nuisance. (I used to live behind the building and it's a subtle, barely noticeable odor.) Hopefully they will outlast the haters and stay in the neighborhood for a long time."}
{"text":"In the mood for BBQ?  That BBQ Joint is pretty good.  I got some take out from there last night.  My husband got rib tips for $12.99 and come with 2 (very) small sides.  I got smoked chicken wings for $10.99 which also come with 2 (very) small sides.  The order of wings also only comes with 6 wings....pretty pricey in my estimation.  The interior of the restaurant is very plain and no frills....its not very inviting as far as a dine-in experience.    The food was pretty good and its slim pickins for BBQ in Madison so I'd probably come back next time the BBQ spirit moves us but I am not singing praises to the BBQ Gods."}
{"text":"Alright, so I was a little hesitant to try this place based on some of the reviews. But! I'm so glad I did.  First off, the fries were fine. Golden brown, clearly frozen from a bag but they are cooked well. I like french fries, so I was happy. I get to dip them in a variety of BBQ sauces which is ideal.  I've had rib tips and regular ribs there. They have a good regular BBQ sauce and a nice mustard. Hot BBQ sauce is good but a bit vinegary for my tastes. Consistent food, employees are super nice. Ribs have that nice pink smoked ring. Not the best BBQ I've ever had but it certainly holds it's own in this town. A big improvement from what was in this location previously. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. The owner was really friendly and clearly has a passion for what he does. Food was really good as well. This is a great little neighborhood joint to eat at."}
{"text":"1.  Here is a link to my (and a friend's) food Vlog (Youtube video) about TBBQJ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjymVaaY0Gw  2.  They have moved, and have added new additions to the menu.  Try the smoked corned beef reuben and the honey chili glazed wings.  OMG OMG OMG OMG."}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place has truly AUTHENTIC SOUTHERN COOKING! Between us, my friend and I had the pulled pork sandwich, the beef brisket sandwich, creamy collard greens, fried okra, jalapeño hush puppies, a wing and two ribs. Hands down, bar none, this was THE BEST brisket I have ever had! Tender, melt-in-the-mouth with just the right amount of smokey goodness! The pulled pork was tender, flavorful and really good. The greens were cooked to \"just wilted\" and the flavoring was sublime. The okra had a wonderful light breading and was really quite good....but the HUSH PUPPIES!!! Wow!!! The size of an old fashioned, homemade donut hole with that little jalapeño kick! YOWZA!!!! The wing was AMAZING! Again, just the right amount of smokey goodness and TENDER. And the ribs! The meat was so delectably tender and flavorful and pulled off the bone like a hot knife through butter!!! I thought the size of the sandwiches were generous and the amount of greens was just right. The hush puppies come four to an order and the okra was a good bowlful.  The interior was casual, clean and very simply done. I came right after work (5:15, Thursday) and parked easily on Jennifer St. Holy Toledo, if you really appreciate GOOD BBQ, you've got to stop in!!! The hours are a little funky, but make it work with your schedule!! (We-Sa 12-2:30  3:30-8 // Su, Mo, Tu CLOSED)"}
{"text":"I am not accustomed to giving five star reviews and I would prefer to give a 4.5 stars, but I am rounding up this time.  I have ordered from here twice, most recently about 1:15 minutes ago.  I was all ready to get the recommended 1/2 chicken with sides when I noticed a Chicken Sammie on the specials menu.  Oh my....what I completely delicious sandwich.  I would order without the lettuce next time, but otherwise it was extremely tasty.  I wanted to stop after eating half the sandwich, but I could not and ate the whole thing!  The sandwich had mayonnaise.or something similar), tomato and onions.  The bun was also great!  I was given some extra wings (it was closing time and they probably had some they needed throw out or use)....no sauce and they were great too, but I only ate two because the sandwich was more than enough.  I want to go back, try the wings with a sauce, get the 1/2 chicken, and try everything on the menu.  I have lived all over this wonderful country of ours; I would stack this up with the best out there.  I recommend a stop by anyone."}
{"text":"BEST BBQ in town!  Very friendly staff, small restaurant but worth it.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, creamy coleslaw and colllard greens and wings.  The wings were by far the best I have had in my life.  Crispy on the outside, smoky and moist on the inside.  Full of flavor.  The staff were very friendly.  Sauces on the side were great, mustard based wasn't my favorite, but other two were out of this world.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place!  I've eaten That BBQ Joint takeout twice now,  and it was consistently good.   On both occasions,  I was picking up dinner for the family so tried a variety including ribs,  chicken,  rib tips,  brisket,  collared greens,  chili,  and their fries.   Their smoked meats are great.   I don't care for overly smoked meat, but BBQ Joint does it perfectly.   I would agree with previous reviewers who said ribs/chicken are seasoned and flavorful enough sans sauce, especially the ribs.   The chicken,  however,  was on the drier side,  so really needed the sauce.   Brisket by itself was a little dry,  but I also know that we got the last of tonight's batch.   Awesome flavor.  The collared greens may be my favorite.   So good!  And I'm thankful there aren't pieces of pork fat in them.  On a related note,  I have to say that I was disappointed with the chili.  The flavor was good and loved the big beans,  but it had too many very fatty pieces of meat throughout it.   I tried to pick around them,  but there really were too many,  coupled with the fact that the fatty pieces were attached to the meat so just gave up.   My chickens loved it though.  :)  I'm also wishing they had a crusty bread option,  in lieu of the soft doughy rolls.   Everything seems to be house made,  and made well!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal -- I really wanted to not like this place, from what others have said about them running out of food, the difficulties in finding parking, their limited hours and the inevitable not being able to get in on a busy Friday or Saturday night, but that was not the case!  They are the nicest folks in the world!  However, the food, although very good, wasn't quite the home run we were hoping for.  For us this stems from hubby being very particular about his brisket and our devotion to our favorite BBQ food cart which continues to be a step above all the brick and mortars we try.  I got the rib basket which was three bones with two sides.  Originally I wanted the collard greens and baked beans as my sides but they had just run out of the beans so I went with the brisket chili.  Ribs were perfect.  Not fatty at all, great flavor.  I was really excited to try the collard greens to see how the compared to Pickle Jar BBQs collards.  Although good, just not as good in my mind.  If you are a collard green fan, you gotta hunt down Pickle Jar when their food cart is out.  Hubby was bummed out when he saw the brisket on the sandwich he got.  The excess fat was plainly visible to him versus finding it when as he works through the meat.  It was disappointing but this seems to be the theme everywhere he gets brisket so it must be a hard meat to do lean.  He reports the flavor was good, but not great.  What sets apart That BBQ Joint in my mind is their service with a smile, intimate knowledge of their menu and the mix of foods they offer.  I say this about most of the BBQ places I review, we'll be back, but likely after our favorite BBQ food cart shuts down for winter."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich in town!!!! After trying different brisket options around town, that is my solid opinion. It's got it all: a perfect bun, sassy pickles, a huge amount of tender, thinly sliced, smoky, amazing brisket. So satisfying in every way! Eating it is a very, very, very good idea. It should win an award. Really!"}
{"text":"Per Corey D's recommendation, I tried the smoked wings.  The wings have a nice slightly crisped skin and you can use the BBQ sauce bottles to flavor if so desired.  It is also entirely possible to enjoy the wings without sauce.  The brisket chili is pretty good, although nto entirely remarkable.  Same with the fries--I wish they were fresh instead of from frozen. Surprisingly, there is a vegetarian sandwich available, rare in a BBQ joint!    There have been some odd mishaps here--on two occasions in the old location they didn't tell me they were out of an item until after I ordered, although they added more food to make up for it.  If you want ribs, call ahead--my understanding is that they frequently sell out!"}
{"text":"Got carry out - Brisket, Ribs, greens, slaw, beans, and a beef sandwich for ride home. (possible  - needed to half ass a towel /bib  & it's worth it). Brisket was really good and the buns they give on side with the1# perfect for sammys. The ribs were excellent. felt like there were plenty of them for the $ and they nice and meaty. The flavor was really good - kind of sweet spicy bark from their seasoning and were done just right, not overcooked falling off the bone mushy more like the feel of a well cooked steak. Didn't think prices were out of line - essentially got 5 good meals with sides for under $15 each"}
{"text":"That BBQ Joint is a no-fuss, no-frills solid effort. It won't be the best you've had, but you won't be disappointed.  I've been to That BBQ Joint 3 times. Two of the three times they were out of brisket, so lesson learned - arrive around the opening times if you want the full menu available. Here's what I've had: pulled pork sandwich, ribs, brisket sandwich, creamy coleslaw, and fried mac n' cheese ball. Everything was very tasty and the ribs were a standout - I'd certainly get that again.  While I preferred plain sliced brisket, the sandwich was excellent and the brisket is sliced very thin. Think lunch meat thin. My wife said it was her favorite brisket ever simply because of the thin slices.  I found the Carolina sauce to be a bit too mustard-y for me and could be sweeter, so I mixed their regular BBQ sauce with the Carolina and it seemed to be perfect. But that was just a little hack from a guy who prefers sweeter sauce.  The dining area isn't much to look at but it was clean. Service was friendly and fast and I always enjoy a non-chain place that's confident in what they serve. I'd like to explore more of the menu, but I'm from out of town.   I'd recommend this place as a quick lunch stop, or a fast dinner if you don't want to fuss with sit-down, wait service, tipping and all that. The neighborhood was pretty cool as well and we hit up a few shops around the block."}
{"text":"A bit overrated. I've had better quality and taste for the price. Not too many choices either."}
{"text":"The sandwich was incredible and the brisket chili pretty good.  We were on the early side and they were already out of ribs and the dining room was freezing.  So I'll definitely go back and try them again and could easily see upping my review to 5 stars.  This place has promise."}
{"text":"Excellenet food evrything evryone had was great"}
{"text":"Pretty outstanding Ruben. Maybe the best I've had in Madison.  Came an hour before closing time and they were out of a couple things. Sadly that includes ribs. I'm very happy with everything. The cheese curds were amazing. With the bacon cooked right in.  Chill simple atmosphere. Kinda pricy. So worth it."}
{"text":"Five stars for the brisket alone. Amazing. Lean, deeply smoked slices with visible rings at a respectable depth. The cole slaw was good, the beans were OK. Nobody goes to a BBQ joint for sides, so they are never a factor in my star ratings. We sampled al three sauces, which while a touch sweet for my tastes, were so equally good I had a hard time deciding where to dip each slice of brisket. It looks unassuming from the curb, as any good 'cue joint should, but inside it is spotless and welcoming.  I will definitely be back to sample, savor and review the other offerings from this place that everyone in Dane County should feel blessed to have in their midst."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while and finally had the chance tonight. It wasn't bad, but I left feeling slightly disappointed:  PROS: + The seating area is small and no frills, but it was clean and comfortable. + My pulled pork sandwich was large and filling. The price (around 8 bucks) seemed reasonable.  + The bun that the sandwich was served on was PERFECT. It was fresh, tasty, and stood up to the sauce without breaking apart.  + There are self-serve dispensers with three decent, but not knock your socks off good, sauces. It would be nice, though, if they could place smaller bottles on the tables  CONS - It took WAY longer than I expected to get my order.  - The pulled pork itself was rather dry and lacking in flavor. I needed to douse it in sauce to get anything out of it.  - The sandwich didn't come with fries, so I ordered a side. Big mistake. They were fresh and plentiful, but completely lacking in any flavor whatsoever.  - The selection of sides is limited. They have a fried mac and cheese ball on their menu, but no Mac and cheese. I take that to mean that the ball is frozen.  -Their hours suck. They close at 8 PM, even on the weekend."}
{"text":"My kind of comfort food. I've been several times and love everything I've had on the menu. This includes the smoked chicken wings, ribs, Friday fish fry, and Chicago dog (an occasional special). As for the sides, I'm a big fan of the green beans and baked beans. I am not a fan of the vinegar slaw (although I haven't ordered this since they were in their old location). The fried Mac and cheese is delicious, but I recommend sharing it, if you're getting a full meal.   I enjoy their fish fry, but it too often sells out and the breading is a little too salty for my taste. It is not a traditional Wisconsin fish fry, you could probably call it southern style.  I've been going to that BBQ joint since it was in it's original location (batch's old location and where banzo is now) and love it. My only complaint is I often crave it on a Monday when they're closed and you have to plan ahead or be flexible if you go for dinner as they're often sold out of certain entrees -- from my experience the ribs and the specials.  My understanding is they smoke the ribs overnight, so  once the day's batch is sold, they're out for the remainder of the day.  Tip: If you're ordering take out call ahead. My food typically takes ~15 min to come out, so it's nice to have it ready to go when I get there, if I'm not dining in.  2nd Tip: If you want ribs on a weekend, call ahead. I've never done this, but I have gone in for dinner on Saturdays when they're out of ribs and they've recommended calling ahead and they'll reserve them for you."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend recently, and was extremely disappointed based on some of the reviews singing the praises of That BBQ Joint.  Ordered both the ribs and pulled pork, and wouldn't ever order either again.    The pork was flavorless, and while pork shoulder will never match up with something like brisket for flavor, past experience has shown me that pulled pork can be quite tasty in its own right.  Even the pieces that had a bit of bark on them lacked any sort of real flavor.  The ribs, meanwhile, were barely edible.  There was no trace of a smoke ring or bark on them at all.  Instead, they were chewy, clung to the bone with awful resolve, and didn't have any flavor either.  All in all, the meal was a big let down, especially after the positive reviews from others.  For now, at least, Smoky John's remains the lone bastion of good BBQ in the Madison area."}
{"text":"An amazing first visit. Got the ribs and tried both the original and spicy barbeque sauce. Both had great flavor and accented the amazingly cooked ribs. The creamy slaw and beans were great sides. Had a chance to try some of the chicken wings as well, and will have to get them next time."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is really casual, but still clean and pleasant, and the food is delicious. Granted, I've only ever had the ribs, but they're fantastic ribs. Everything is very fresh, and they even make their own barbecue sauce, which is also pretty terrific. If you like bbq, you'll love this place. If there is one caveat however, it's that this restaurant is rather small, and can't accommodate large groups. As long you come with a small party, you'll have a good time and enjoy some reasonably priced awesome barbecue."}
{"text":"Tried this place, the food was not very good at all. Nothing tasted good and the service was about the same. We went up to the counter and there was no one there for about 5 minutes so we were just waiting. Then when the clerk finally showed up, there was no apology, it was kind of strange. I would not go back to this place again"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I plan on taking pictures to contribute to a review, but I've never even gotten the chance.  I always remember right around the time I come-to in a joyous, food coma haze.    Everything is amazing (special shout-out to the Italian beef!) and the sauces! My god, the sauces. Tears of joy.  I think I've tried every side on offer by now and they're all incredible.  My favorite might be the brisket chili, but collard greens (with a dash of the mustard sauce) and the bbq beans (with a dash of the spicy sauce) are definitely my mainstay.    I recommend the food here ALL the time, and it's usually my go-to spot to take out-of-towners for lunch.  The food's always fresh, the service super friendly, and did I mention how much I love their sauces?   My one tip would be to eat in rather than taking the Q to go; having their sauce on the table rather than in a little to-go cup just works out better if you like to \"apply liberally\" like me.  Be warned that it's a fairly small place though, you'd probably want to keep your group size under 5 to make sure you're able to find a seat.  Take your friends in waves and you'll get to visit even more often! Score!  Now I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"I ended up at That BBQ Joint (TBJ) by happenstance after my efforts to visit the newly opened A-OK Coffee location on East Washington Avenue were foiled by my inability to find a parking space.  But my luck was not all bad that day as both the food and service at TBJ exceeded my expectations.    There is a definite black and white theme to the restaurant interior.  The interior walls have a fresh coat of institutional white paint, with black trim around the doors and windows.  The menus are written on whiteboards with black ink and the food comes on a black & white checkerboard patterned paper liner.  The large front windows allow for waves of natural light to stream into the interior and allow diners keep tabs on the action taking place on Willy Street.  While the building has seen better days, the new occupants have cleaned it up nicely.  Since TBJ does not have waiter service, I had limited interaction with the staff.  Nonetheless, all the staff members I interacted with were courteous, polite and helpful.  As a first time visitor, my order taker offered helpful suggestions when I mentioned I was visiting for the first time.  He also checked in to see what I thought of my sandwich which doesn't always happen at counter service restaurants.  Throughout my time at TBJ, this employee was constantly tidying out the dining area and checking the condiment supply levels when there was a break in the somewhat steady flow of lunch time customers.  I elected to go with the Thursday special, the TBJ Cubano sandwich (pulled pork, ham, mustard, pickles and a pressed, well-buttered French roll). Mad props to the kitchen for their fantastic griddle work on the French roll as every bite yielded a satisfying crunch.  The pulled pork component provided plenty of porky deliciousness.  The Achilles heel of the sandwich was the ocean of generic yellow mustard slathered onto the sandwich.  With a little better balance, this could be a top echelon sandwich in town with an amazing stable of sandwich offerings.  Bonus content: TBJ sells bottles of their sauce for $8.  After this positive first impression, a return visit to TBJ is certainly in my future.  The wonderful aroma of smoked meats wafting through the restaurant during my first visit has me eager to try there more traditional BBQ offerings of smoked brisket, ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken."}
{"text":"This isn't my first visit here, and it definitely won't be my last!  I love just about everything on this menu, and it takes extremely good, with tender meats and a great variety of sauces!   I split a meal tonight with my bf, we just weren't super hungry, but man I wish we had ordered our own! The Italian beef sandwich with sides of pasta salad and collard greens were much needed comfort food. I highly recommend this sandwich! It comes with au jus and giardiniera, and I also think collard greens are a MUST with southern bbq.  Definitely check this place out for some quality, reasonably priced bbq plates!"}
{"text":"That BBQ Joint is unquestionably the current title holder for best barbecue in Madison.  Yes, their hours can be unpredictable and the often run out of a few items by the end of the night, but the ribs, wings and brisket are fantastic.  I think the pulled pork is good, but not their best dish, in my opinion.  Sides are small but good, particularly the creamy slaw.  Owner is very friendly and you can't beat the food.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This spot is good. Really good. I sampled the rib tips and they were a little different from what I'm used to but not in a bad way at all. I ordered them to go and the sauce was served on the side - I actually like that! The sauces are awesome here and the best part is that they are not stingy at all...if you want more sauce - it's available. I enjoyed being able to mix and match and see what combination tasted the best. My favorite is a dip in mustard and a dunk in regular - perfect.   The real surprise here was the Reuben sandwich. This thing delivered in a big way and is absolutely delicious. My dining partner ordered this monster and despite its proportions finished it in no time.  I am definitely willing to say that this is the best Reuben in Madison, hands down, and this is no small feat.   I will be back here. Definitely recommend calling ahead for takeout as the establishment is small...they accommodate in house dining - just don't count on it."}
{"text":"HOLY GRILLED CHICKEN WINGS! How do they pack so much flavor into wee little wings?  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE! Smoky and delicious.  And you pick up 6, 20 or just one! Same goes for their ribs.  So naturally I ordered 6 wings and a couple of ribs for good measure, and I have to tell ya, it's likely I'll be back this weekend. Simply awesome. Reasonably priced. Lovely staff. Not a single thing I'd change about the experience. They could use a stronger sign to catch people driving by, but there low profile is part of the charm of the place."}
{"text":"Finally some awesome BBQ in Madison!!!   We came here for lunch yesterday, about 20 minutes after TBJ opened. The place was already full, with a few groups waiting for take-out orders. We had planned to dine in, but decided to order to go since there weren't tables available. We ordered the ribs and chicken wings, with sides of collards and brisket chili.   Our order came pretty quickly; we waited maybe 10 minutes, and we were offered water while we waited. The food was really tasty! I don't normally order chicken when I get BBQ, but I have to agree with everyone else's reviews for it...the wings are really flavorful. They have a great smoky flavor, with a nice dry rub that adds some spice. We got them with a side of spicy BBQ sauce, which was good but had a bit of a strong clove flavor. The ribs were amazing! They're smoky, juicy, and very flavorful. They go well with the regular BBQ sauce, but they're great on their own as well. The sides were good, too, particularly the brisket chili.   I'll definitely be back to try more of their items. I think it's great that they offer small orders of their meats (you can order just 1 rib on the side if you want!) so you're able to try more things. Definitely be prepared to order take-out if you come here, as the place is small (3-4 tables and some counter seating)."}
{"text":"Definitely a rock solid bbq place, I would recommend this place to bbq enthusiasts. I ordered brisket sandwich and the smoked chicken wings.  The brisket was a 3 out of 5, nice solid smokey flavour, thought it needed a little more seasoning.  The smoked chicken wings were easily a 4 out of 5; excellent crispy smokey skin.  I couldn't decide on sauce so they gave me everything, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Cool little place, but we had mixed reviews on the food. Picked up an order to-go recently and had an order of the pulled pork and a slab of ribs. The pork was pretty darn good and came with giant buns to make a delicious pork sandwich. We all agreed though that the BBQ sauce that came on the side was NOT good at all. Not sure what was wrong, but the taste was way off. We ended up using some bottled sauce from the fridge instead. The ribs, while meaty and pretty tender, were nothing special and again better without the sauce. This dish came with a side of the spicy BBQ sauce which was just as odd as the regular - just spicier! All in all, we might give it a shot again sometime down the road, but for now I think we'll look elsewhere for a BBQ-fix."}
{"text":"Okay, I spend a lot of time searching out new and delicious BBQ wherever I travel. My standards for BBQ are VERY high and I've had a chance to visit some amazing places as well as judge competition BBQ. With that in mind I was excited to hear about a new option for BBQ here in Madison and decided to give it a shot as soon as I was in the neighborhood. It took quite a bit longer than I wanted but today I was finally in the right place at the right time.   Just driving down Willy St. past TBBQJ I caught that first delicious whiff of wood smoke wafting through the air. By the time I found parking and walked into the very cool building I was extremely excited for lunch! The menu is pretty straightforward, which makes ordering simple, but I would like to see a few more options that should be relatively easy to offer. There's not really a 'combo platter' or anything like that which makes it easy to sample the breadth of the menu. That being said, I like having the option to order a single rib or chicken wing; that's something cool I haven't seen before. The space is larger than I expected and it was easy enough to find seating between the two connected dining rooms. The utensils and condiments are all laid out conveniently, which is also really nice. I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich, a single rib, a single chicken wing, and a small order of ranch beans along with an unsweetened iced tea. I grabbed a seat and waited a short time for the meal to be brought out to me. So far, everything was great!   Unfortunately the food I had was on the disappointing side. The single spare rib was dry rubbed and somewhat bland. I like the idea of dry rubbing BBQ and allowing people to add sauce as needed/wanted but to make that model work the dry rub needs to accentuate the taste of the meat. This rub failed to do so effectively. On top of that the rib was a little on the underdone side, leading to some toughness and dryness. The smoke flavor of the rib was nice, but it was under seasoned and otherwise less than spectacular. I did appreciate that the membrane had been removed from the backside of the rib. The single chicken wing was somewhat similar to the single rib, well smoked but under seasoned and dry rubbed without sauce. The texture was much better on the wing than the rib with a nice chew and no rubberiness; big win there! Both of these items benefited significantly from the addition of the house BBQ sauce, which was surprisingly quite a bit better than the spicy house BBQ sauce. The ranch beans were probably the highlight of the meal with a great mouth feel and flavor. I especially loved the pulled pork cooked into the beans. Delicious!   The low point of the meal was the paper thin brisket on the sandwich. Slicing brisket this way does yield exceptionally tender ribbons of beef, but it also leads to an incredibly dry product. A good amount of sliced brisket was served on a nice roll with a couple big crisp slices of pickle, but the overwhelming sensation was of sahara-like dryness. Of course the sandwich was begging for sauce, but that should never be the case for really great BBQ. There's no way I'd order this sandwich again, and I really wish I'd tried pretty much anything else on the menu instead. There did seem to be some interesting options coming out around me, but they were all very non-traditional. There's nothing wrong with non-traditional in general but it's not what I'm looking for from a BBQ joint.   I'd be willing to give TBBQJ another shot, but I would undoubtedly change up my order in a MAJOR way. Overall I was disappointed in this particular visit, but remain optimistic that there's potential here for a much better experience. Plenty of potential here, but the execution on what I had today was unfortunately lacking."}
{"text":"There really isn't much I can say about this place that hasn't been said already, so I mainly just want to reinforce the fact that everyone is right - this place is pretty amazing.   On my last visit I ordered a half-rack of ribs, baked beans, vinegar-y coleslaw, and a mac & cheese ball. The ribs were smoky and delicious, the beans were easily the best I have ever had - just tons of flavor with huge chunks of tasty porky goodness, the coleslaw was super fresh with jalapenos that added a nice and spicy bite, and the mac & cheese ball.....my god.......It was one of the greatest appetizers I have ever eaten, and as long as you don't mind the possibility of having your heart slow down and blood thicken as you are eating a giant glob of fried cheese and noodles you really have to try it.   It would be great if there was more seating, but I understand that it's not super easy (or affordable) to find a big space for that. You also have to get there early as things like brisket and chicken wings sell out fairly often."}
{"text":"Order of jerk chicken and a pork sandwich morphed into order of grilled chicken wings and 2 slices of pie.  Let me explain.  I arrived at That BBQ Joint for takeout later in the evening, and as you can imagine, much was sold out (which is true of good BBQ joints).  I ordered the jerk chicken and a solo pork sandwich to go.  After paying and waiting for about 10 minutes for my order to be ready, the employee informed me that they were just out of jerk chicken and so I asked for a substitute of chicken wings.  Since there was a small price difference and I already paid, he asked if something like a side or dessert could be thrown into the order as well, which I agreed.  I checked my order after I got home--wing entree, two slices of pie, but no sandwich! I agreed to sub wing entree+side for the jerk chicken.  I decided not to call back about it since overall the value turned out to be the same, but I guess it's just a reinforcement that one should always check takeout orders anyways.  Out of the sides, I definitely prefer the baked beans to the brisket chili, and both the sweet potato and pecan pies are very good and worthy of your time. But I really wanted a sandwich too!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the food, if I could get some.  The pulled pork sandwich is great (probably the best in Madison) and I love the jalapeno hush puppies.  I was rooting for tThat BBQ Joint in their battle against locals who found olfactory offense from the smell of their smoker.  But ... the hours are inconvenient (closed three days a week, and closed 2:30-3:30 on days they are open); it is not uncommon for them to run out of certain dishes; and most recently I called to place a take-out order - no answer, \"voice mail full\" message.    The BBQ scene in Madison is not outstanding, and I so was really excited about That BBQ Joint appearing. Yet it suffers from the same service woes that many other local restaurants do.  No worries: I am traveling south twice in the next two months, so I will get my fill of outstanding BBQ shortly."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey for the portions that you are getting, this place makes it all up with the rich flavors of their dishes! I am a HUGE fan of their wings. They provide a smokey barbecue flavor, that has a perfectly crisp outer layer with every bite! The restaurant also offers a really cool, progressive, liberal vibe, which I really dig. Thanks for making a statement! Pro-Tip: Order two."}
{"text":"Only have visited this place once so far:  Checked this place out on a weekday for lunch on a whim with my husband. I had actually been a couple months in, on a no-meat diet and wasn't sure what I'd be able to find on the menu, that would agree with me, but hesitantly agreed to eat here, thinking I'd probably just order potato salad.  All ordering is done at the counter from a menu board on the wall, and there are two dining rooms from which you can select seating. I actually ended up choosing a pulled pork sandwich and surprisingly enjoyed it! Really great smoked flavor, and tender meat. A choice of BBQ sauce flavors/heat levels are available that you can pump out into a cup yourself from a counter at the end of the room.  If I were to have a pulled pork craving, this would be my second choice. My first and favorite choice is Bob's Bitchin' BBQ in Dodgeville. That BBQ Joint is a great choice for no-frills nicely done BBQ meat, AND it's here in Madison. It can get quite busy during the lunch hour, so be aware of that if you're stopping on your lunch break. I recommend calling ahead for pick up if time is an issue."}
{"text":"A group of us went over for lunch today from work as we were craving good bbq and we were not disappointed.  We found the food plenty and the sauces were delicious.  Our only complaint was that the beans while hot had no flavor.  Most of us dumped sauce in to give them some flavor.  We will be back but we will probably pass on the beans the next time."}
{"text":"The only dings I give this AMAZING place, is that they are closed on Monday and Tuesday, and they too often run out of brisket late in the week (with reason: It's *that* good... hence the line out the door, sometimes).  Other than that, I can safely say That BBQ Joint is bar-none not only my favorite BBQ... but also my favorite place to eat in Madison. My go-to sandwich is the Italian beef (hint: get the mild peppers, unless you want to *really* sweat it out). But if they offer the pork tacos, you gotta try 'em! Even the friday fish fry was fantastic! The sides are all gorgeous, but I have a special place in my heart for their sweet potato fries.   A very welcome addition to the neighborhood! (Now, please... make *more* brisket, dammit... Willy Street is HUNGRY!)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pound of tips with fries. The meat overall was solid. Nice burnt tips and tender solid meat. Fries were pretty good too. The sauce is where my criticism lies. It's not bad but it's not my fav. They were out of the mo spicy so I had the regular which was okay, nothing special. The cashier was a super friendly lady and the food was out pretty quick which was nice. I would stop by again when in Madison."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Pulled pork is really, really, really good. I don't want to eat anymore today because I want that taste to stay in my mouth. The service was less than genial but that didn't ruin the experience for me one bit because the food is seriously good. Brisket chili was also awesome. I loved the bumper stickers on the wall. It's worth a stop."}
{"text":"In my quest to find a great barbeque spot in Madison I stumbled across That BBQ Joint.  It looked like a potentially small gem and is in a good neighborhood for food so I decided to try lunch there.  As a longtime Madison resident I've been disappointed over the lack of solid BBQ options, and was hoping this place would fill the void.  Greetings were warm and prompt when I arrived, and my order was brought out in a reasonable amount of time.  everything is fairly do-it-yourself, with menus on the side wall along with napkins, silverware, sauces, etc.  All the food is reasonably priced at $7-10 for the average item.  I had read some Yelp reviews prior so I knew to stay away from the fries.  I tried an Italian Beef Brisket sandwich (whatever that means as it looked like regular Italian Beef to me) with hot peppers and a side of Beef Brisket Chili.  The food looked pretty straight forward, nothing too salivating but I let my taste buds do the talking.  The result?  OK, not exceptional.  I think I agree with most here that I just wasn't wow'd by the taste, a bit too bland, especially the sauces, and the chili was just hot but not actually too flavorful.  I'd like to consider trying them again, because usually I'd get something more BBQ-esque like Pulled Pork or Ribs.  I went against the grain this time around though since other reviewers had mentioned the cornerstone items being dry and I wanted to first sample what did get some positive reviews (and looked tasty in the pictures).    I really wanted this to be the piece that completed Madison's BBQ puzzle, but it just doesn't seem like it is.  Maybe your mileage will vary.  Until next time. . ."}
{"text":"Like Pig Butts and Cannot Lie??? That BBQ Joint is here to satisfy.   Everyone has their own idea of comfort food. For many, comfort food is what you grew up eating...home-cooked Italian dinners, summer barbecues, copious amounts of ice cream...you name it. An individual's version of comfort food largely defines their character. It is representative of their innermost passions and paints a picture of their upbringing. For me, comfort food is the food that makes me happy, the food that brings me back home. And while I by no means grew up in the south...my personal form of comfort food has always been barbecue. When I am feeling down or just plain hungry, it is hearty slabs of ribs and slow cooked juicy brisket that I crave. You can therefore imagine the immense joy I experienced when I came across an inconspicuous barbecue spot while strolling down Willy Street. That BBQ Joint had saved the day.  Housed within the brick walls of this corner shop is a glorious medley of all things meat. They of course have the classics expected of a barbecue spot, serving up sliced brisket, pulled pork, and smoked chicken. But for the real TBJ experience you absolutely must order the smoked wings and a full slab of ribs. Oh heavens, DO NOT FORGET THE RIBS. The quality of the meat combined with the perfect layer of seasoning and a wonderful smoky bite earn these guys high marks.  What makes That BBQ Joint a truly beautiful place is the fact that they do not need to drown their meats in an excessive amount of barbecue sauce. Barbecuing is often a contentious topic and, like the folks at That BBQ Joint, I can affirm myself a staunch supporter of the dry rub method. True barbecued meat should be able to hold its own and not be completely coated in a sugary mess of sauce. I applaud all barbecue places that allow the meat to speak for itself and depend on dry rubs more so than sauces.   Thank heavens that BBQ Joint does just this. While some of their items do have a bit of sauce added, most everything is served dry. In this way, the flavor of the meat is dependent upon the quality of spices and cooking technique, instead of the sweetness of the sauce. With this form of barbecue there is more of an emphasis on \"barbecuing\" rather than \"grilling,\" with the latter corresponding to a greater use of sauces. It is this barbecuing method that stresses that the meat be cooked at a low temperature for a longer period of time. The resulting product therefore attains an incredible smoke and a moist bite that is simply unattainable via the grilling method. In the words of the pit masters: low and slow, baby.   So if you find yourself seeking a respite from the humdrum of ordinary food, bask in the level of delicious that can be found with some TBJ comfort food. Meat-tastic perfection."}
{"text":"For the chicken salad sandwich and sauces, particularly the mustard BBQ, I give 5 stars. Overall, their BBQ (brisket, pork and chicken) is the best Madison has to offer in my opinion. The sides aren't anything to win me over but I do love the seasonal bean salad."}
{"text":"Great BBQ , the only place has great smoke corned beef . I live over 100 miles from this place ,when I drive pass Madison ,I will stop by ."}
