{"text":"I'm not a coffee snob, but you really do get the best cup of coffee possible here. The lowest form you can order is still ground and french-pressed to order, and I don't think they're blowing smoke about the quality of the beans.  Insanely good coffee, like you don't even know. No $1 cup option for sure, but that's the price for the fancy-ass beans I suppose.  Good attitude from the employee, though they could use some process development to prevent follow-up questions"}
{"text":"Just in case anyone is interested Brandon is putting in a guest appearance this morning stop by and say hello!"}
{"text":"I have been on an adventure to explore some of the best coffee all over Phoenix. This is a great little find. The business is connected to a car wash and has a convenient drive thru. They have some nice little pretty unique flavor combinations on their main menu. I loved their theme and the title of their signature drinks. I ordered the Maui Waui, the coconut mocha, and it did not disappoint. The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the drink was HOT. I am sure it may depend of the barista. The drinks were so hot that both my husband and I had to wait a while for it to cool down to take our second sip. I am not saying this a bad thing ( I hate when my coffee get cold too quickly) and it wasn't like it was burnt or anything. It was just so hot that the sleeves designed to absorb the heat did nothing. I would definitely try this place again, but maybe stick to the iced drinks especially in the summer heat."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite coffee spot! Every employee is beyond friendly, polite and helpful.   I go so often, they start making my drink before I've approached the counter."}
{"text":"Honestly the best coffee in Tempe or AZ for that matter. The guy that's always there is very nice and makes an awesome caramel macchiato. Reminds me of the coffee I'd get back in Seattle. If you're looking for something 100x better then Starbucks check this place out. Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!  The customer service is amazing,  I wish I could give them ten stars! I've been three times and each time Chris has been there. He is so nice and really wants you to have a delicious drink. I'm probably never going back to Dutch Bros or Starbucks after trying this place. Every time I leave with a smile. There's never a line, this place couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Kona 13 on my way back to Tucson a camping and hiking trip up near Payson. We were in need of a little caffeine to continue our journey home and I couldn't be happier we chose Kona. Our barista was super friendly and helpful, and the coffee was fantastic. I only wish they had a location in Tucson. Thanks Kona!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The customer service is fantastic, they memorized our names and orders after only our second time there. The coffee is great and they always make sure that you like what you ordered.   If you like chai tea lattes, try it with the French vanilla syrup! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendliest people around & the best coffee. What's Dutch bros? Team kona!! This coffee is the best thing that has happened to me all morning."}
{"text":"Good over eager service and good coffee. Barely spotted this place but glad I stopped by. Save and come back kinda place. Hugs"}
{"text":"Coffee was great, one of us had the coconut mocha and the other had a regular coffee. They French press all regular coffee. The employee was very helpful and helped us out since we were visiting from out of town. The only thing to note is the seating is all outside so it wouldn't be the place if you wanted to get inside. I would return next time I'm in town and would recommend a stop."}
{"text":"WHITNEY IS A CLASS ACT!!! She METICULOUSLY crafted our Americano EXACTLY to our specifications, allowing us to TASTE IT as she was making it to ENSURE that it was of a satisfactory level of quality. (Man, are we high maintenance or WHAT??) But seriously though. Go say hi to Whitney."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place a few weeks ago just because it happened to be on my way that day. The owner John and main barista Chris truly care about the coffee and have spared no expense making it the best coffee around. I will continue to tell everyone i know to get their coffee at this new spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee! You don't buy it until you try it! The owner was extremely friendly and explained their product and his employees were personable. Best service we've had at a coffee shop since we have been in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Tried the kona and it was awesome. Highly recommend when in Tempe. Hard to find because of car wash but worth the time."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab coffee on the go. Awesome signature drink list, good coffee, soy and almond milk options and great, friendly service."}
{"text":"This Place is AWESOME ....Best Iced coffee in the valley.... Very frendly staff and always fast service ... This is a daily stop for me before work"}
{"text":"I honestly think it's impossible to have a bad day after coming here. The only thing better than the amazing coffees is the welcoming customer service. They make everyone who stops at their window feel like the most important person in the universe. My best mornings start at Kona Coffee. I'm so glad they opened up so close to my little condo!"}
{"text":"Kona Tempe is awesome! My co-worker told me about this place because she goes to the one up North and had so many good things to say! I am boring and only get a large plain black iced tea but it is my new favorite! I was going to Coffee Bean and Paradise Bakery for tea's before but can't stop going to Kona! The $10 card is a GREAT deal too, you get your first drink free. The customer service is always outstanding too! So glad that I found this place!!! ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee is perhaps a necessity in my life, hence making it important for me to find the greatest of coffee shops. Driving by Kona 13 was perhaps the best decision I've ever made.   My first experience was with Chris, indeed the best barista I've ever encountered. I've been to Dutch Bros. and other related coffee shops in the past, and they all seem to have a somewhat friendly crew. But Chris is, without a doubt, the most genuine and knowledgable barista I've ever had the pleasure meeting. Ignoring the fact that Kona 13 uses only the greatest of syrups from the French Alps, and makes extremely delicious drinks, Chris is the reason I refer my friends and keep returning.  My advice: try it and you won't be disappointed. I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Best customer service! Every time I visit this place they always make me feel welcome.  I always get something new and never off the menu.  I am a huge fan of coffee and they have the best.  \"Surprise me.\" Is what I always say and they have never given me something I didn't like.  They always have great deals. Will be my regular place!"}
{"text":"New favorite coffee shop! Absolutely love it! Fantastic customer service and the best coffee I've ever had. Definitely need to try out!"}
{"text":"I have to comment on this place, since I was very impressed. I came here wanting to try something new, I noticed the yelp coupon and decided to try it out. I passed here a few times but didn't ever really stop by.  This place is amazing!! I am a very big coffee person and have made a point to try any place in phx. This is my fav in Tempe now.. I wish I would've tried it earlier I just didn't know it'd be so good.  Big perks: -unique drinks- I tried the shark bite with coconut milk (normally breve- they have every milk you can think of, soy, almond, etc). There's a lot of fun combos to try and he mentioned you could also make your own. -whipped cream- Home made, very unique flavors you prob won't find anywhere else. When I went there was toffee, coffee and another flavor along with regular vanilla. I ended up mixing the first two and both were excellent!! Apparently the whip cream flavors vary based on the day which makes it even more enticing.  -The coffee itself= very good.  -Customer service, accommodating & friendly. Let me try samples and very helpful with order.  I'll definitely be back. I suggest everyone come here."}
{"text":"Updated review...the first time my coworker and I had amazing coffees. The 3x's after our first visit...the coffees have gone downhill. Today is officially the day we will never go back. My cafe Americano tasted like coffee flavored water...not a rich robust espresso drink. What a let down."}
{"text":"a good temporary replacement for my daily coffee drive thru. The first time I came here I had a blended coffee with hazelnut syrup and it was okay but it didn't meet my expectations. also it might take you a while to figure out thier location."}
{"text":"I stopped here while my car was getting washed and detailed. I ended up talking with the manager of the coffee shop and started chatting about the coffee business and how the coffee beans come from Hawaii. I am not a coffee guy at all but he sold me on trying the coffee and I must say its GOOD! I am excited to see a business in that location that offers good service and a good product."}
{"text":"Baristas were friendly and seemed to care that I got the drink I wanted.   The iced mocha was tasty, and presentation was appealing, having swirls of chocolate syrup in the drink.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love Kona! It saves me every morning! And the owner is wonderful! He is the nicest person you will meet! I  was having a bad day and he just inspired me to go out and change that day! Even though something bad happened he changed my day!"}
{"text":"Great coffee with equally great customer service and prices. Say goodbye to over-priced Starbucks."}
{"text":"They have the best blended coffee drinks! I may also be obsessed with anything coconut but the point is they totally fill that craving."}
{"text":"What a fun and different approach to a drive thru pick-me-up. Coffee lovers should relish in appreciation for Kona. Iced or in a nice French press, this is a good product at a good price delivered with great customer service."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to get their iced Pipeline... iced coffee with a shot of espresso...soo good! Barista was super friendly and this is my go to coffee spot in the area. Great coffee spot."}
{"text":"Kona 13 definitely knows what's what in the coffee world!   My brother recommended we stop for a drink after breakfast, I was a little skeptical about giving this place a try but I am very glad we stopped.    I had a sip of just plain black coffee and the flavor was fantastic (hot but fantastic!) I also sampled the caramel macchiato which was better than any other version of this drink i have had.   If in the area, this is the place to get your coffee!"}
{"text":"Looove that this is a drive through. If I'm needing coffee, I probably don't want to get out of my car.  Had a black coffee and a coconut mocha (forget the cute name). Both we're pretty great.  Very reasonable prices, much better than the green star place :)"}
{"text":"Wowwwww!!!!  The drinks here are awesome!  I had the Lucky 13 an Irish cream breve and it was the best that I have had ever.  The whipped cream was also amazing as it is home made not out of a store bought can.  You should check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale from NYC and I have not been able to find coffee (I prefer coffee shops over chains) other than Starbucks or dunkin until my neighbor took us here. O. M. G. It is the best coffee I ever had!!! My friends flew in from NYC to visit this week and I took them so we could get caffeinated before driving to Vegas and they loved it too! Pumpkin spice was DELICIOUS!!!! I highly recommend everyone to go here!"}
{"text":"I go here almost every morning and the drive thru is hardly ever busy. The people that work there are so friendly and they even started to remember what I order (the Pipeline - which is coffee and a double shot of espresso over ice). This is the smoothest coffee I've ever had and it tastes great black AND at the fraction of the price of Starbucks. Their signs don't really reflect the prices because mine is only 2.50 when I go - my boyfriend and I can get two large pipelines (he takes his with almond milk) for 6 bucks. Can't beat it!! They serve Lion coffee which is what I had when I was vacationing in Hawaii and it tastes just the same! I love Kona coffee, and I love this place."}
{"text":"Aloooha!!!  The Kona Coffee is great!   Strong and very flavorful.  For good Kona coffee the price is right.  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"All outside seating. The barista was extremely nice and helpful. The coffee tasted great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My new morning coffee shop. I love that they offer almond milk as I am lactose intolerant and all the drinks I have tried are amazing. I now buy the punch card so I get a free drink. I recommended it to my friend since they opened in north scottsdale by her apartment."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times now. The manager Whitney was so nice and helpful. They have every flavor known to man, really good quality. The drinks are outstanding! My husband got the big kahuna and I got an iced chai. The second time I got a cold brew with an extra shot and a little hazelnut. Tastay!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out as I was driving from Tempe to Scottsdale over the weekend and needed a coffee fix.  Loved that there was a Yelp Coupon. Ordered an Americano w/caramel sauce, along with a coconut mocha. The mocha was pretty tasty, but unfortunately the Americano wasn't so great, with no strong espresso flavor at all and it wasn't very hot- just luke warm.  I've been wanting to try Kona 13 because there is a location close to my house in North Scottsdale, but based on this experience, I  won't be going out of my way any time soon. Disappointed as I was really hoping it was going to be as good as all the reviews.  On a positive note, I did like that they had Non-gmo coconut milk and low calorie/sugar almond milk as options for lattes and cream.  The girl helping us was also super friendly, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a carwash and had this amazing coffee! So good! : ) Wish I new about this place sooner. I'll be returning very soon. Kona Coffee! Tried the shark bite this time - white chocolate toffee crunch breve. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is nice. Nice outdoor seating, but lacks indoor seating. Coffee is pretty good. Only have had a hot and iced latte. But i don't think ill return if i want a iced latte because they do not have any liquid sweetener or liquid sugar. I thought all coffee shops had that these days, especially in AZ."}
{"text":"First time going there and it was awesome. The people are really nice and the coffee is simply delicious. Customer service is at its best! Wish we had one of these in LA!"}
{"text":"Hours need to be updated, I don't live in the area so when I try visiting here it's completely out of my way. I've been once and thought it was good, but I've tried coming back a couple of occasions and they've been closed. Not sure if it's worth my trip anymore"}
{"text":"My first experience at Kona 13 was excellent. The subsequent visits after, not so much.   I stop in when I am getting my car washed at Wash Wizard, which is attached to Kona 13. My first experience was an excellent strawberry lemonade on a warm afternoon. The visits after that were definitely not the same.   They have not had anything in stock that I've tried to order since that first visit. The person who was \"serving\" me on my last visit gave me pretty bad service, even walking away from me as I was ordering.   Not sure what the deal is at Kona 13, but the service has gotten worse and their selection has as well, being that I get told \"we don't have that\" every time I stop by. I think I'll skip giving Kona 13 my money during my next visit to Wash Wizard and go elsewhere for a drink."}
{"text":"Was going through major Hawaii withdrawals, when I decided to yelp my way to grab an afternoon pick-me-up and came across this little shop. I stopped by in hopes of getting my caffeine and Hawaiian fix in one... and wouldn't you know it, Kona 13 was the perfect spot!   I was a bit apprehensive at first as Kona 13 is part of a car wash, but that feeling quickly faded once I was greeted by the super awesome barista, Tyler. Remember when people actually LIKED their jobs and gave exceptional customer service? Well, that and more can be said about Tyler. He was absolutely amazing -- giving suggestions on the menu but ultimately made me his special concoction coffee drink, which he calls \"The Cocoa Puff\" (rightfully so, since it takes you back to your childhood when you enjoyed that nice big bowl of Cocoa Puffs while watching your Saturday morning cartoons... ah, the good ol' days!). I asked Tyler not to make it too sweet, since I don't like getting drinking coffee that tastes like cavities are forming in my mouth or like I'm going into a sugar coma... and he made sure I liked the drink before I walked away. He assured me he would remake it if I wasn't happy, but Tyler knows his stuff and didn't need to remake it -- it was love at first sip!   My experience at Kona 13 was phenomenal -- I will definitely be back. The coffee was so flavorful and perfect; it was exactly what I needed. And Tyler's superior customer service was absolutely exceptional! Thanks, Tyler! :)"}
{"text":"Coffee is way above par. The service can change your day from bad to amazing in the matter of seconds. Finally a drive thru without the blaring music and the knowledge of what a bad shot of espresso looks and taste like. Thank you. In my book you are a 10."}
{"text":"I'm here at least once every day - - usually twice.  The coffee is SO drinkable. I'm a lifetime coffee snob, and I could drink gallons of this stuff black.  My favorite is the Vanilla Macadamia roast which is the first flavored coffee I haven't snubbed.   The beans are wonderful and I buy them to brew at home as well.  I love that they use french press for every cup,  and that they measure the weight of espresso before every shot poured. Quality matters. They have a huge variety of milks,  and even grass-fed butter and coconut oil for my bulletproof coffee fix. Oh and the GREEN TEA is incredible.  I add a stevia (WHICH THEY HAVE),  and it's heaven.  When it is hot outside,  I regularly drink 64 iced oz of it per day.  No joke. I drive them nuts.   Oh and if you are into it,  they have a huge variety of flavors made from real cane sugar,  and some pretty creative whipped cream selections.  I've also heard rumors of protein shakes,  milk shakes,  and other yummy creations.   QUICK TIP: if you are short on sleep, and wanting a sweet fix,  try the Undertow... You won't regret it.   Shout out to the Tempe Manager Whitney! She is the best! The customer service rocks,  and the regulars definitely get too many free drinks.  All of the employees are friendly and hilarious,  and learn your name right away.  And you can get a really good deal if you use the punch cards.   I really can't say enough about how great Kona is."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee house, but I have two complaints, the service is a little slow and the hours are not great either.  They open too late and close too early.  They have a drive thru which is important to a lot of people.  If you are adventurous  try a Bullet Proof Coffee, otherwise order what you would order at any other coffee shop I'm sure they can make it.  To make a long story short they'd get a 5 if their service was faster and their hours were longer."}
{"text":"Great coffee, an awesome menu with creative choices and the few we picked didn't disappoint...  But what really stands out here is the customer service: the staff is ridiculously attentive, amazingly courteous and was enthusiastically and proactively willing to make sure we knew what we needed to know and were happy with what we got.   If you're looking for a good coffee (and maybe a kickass car wash y todo) then this is your \"huckleberry\". Add it to the list of a place to hit up if you're near Tempe."}
{"text":"Love this easy-going establishment. Workers are friendly and will make sure you're satisfied with your drink - they ask you to taste it once they hand it to you. You can tell customer service is their priority. Only downside is they're so far from my house or else I'd be going every morning before work.   Bonus is the hawaiian reggae music they play!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of coffee and the staff is always super nice. I like that they allow you to text in your order to avoid the morning rush."}
{"text":"Konalicious Mango Peach Smoothie Goodness!  The guy who works here was super personable and made good suggestions.   I was really loving that mango peach smoothie!  He made me a super strong Americano coffee since I like my coffee strong too!"}
{"text":"Move over Dutch Bro's, Kona 13 Coffee and Tea is where it's at!! I usually am a regular at Dutch Bro's but after seeing the line there the other day I decided to try somewhere new. Walking up to the window I was greeted by the nicest barista who wanted nothing more than to make my day.   I was unsure what I wanted so he gave me a sample of their signature frozen coffee drink. I was skeptical because I usually don't like cold coffee but to be polite I took a sip and HOLY HELL I was in love! It's like a coffee flavored slurpee from heaven. He then mentioned how they have dairy free smoothies and I am a sucker for a dairy free smoothie. (FYI you don't put dairy in smoothies, that's called a milkshake) I was able to mix any flavors I wanted and add whipped cream to it. They even make their own flavored whipped cream there! Strawberry banana, tiramisu, and more!   Lastly the owner came up and asked me what I usually get from other coffee stores and I told him an energy drink which is when he told me about their energy drink and well I obviously had to try it! OH LORDY it was fantastic! They had a few flavors and I tried the cherry-lime which is hands down better than any energy drink i've ever had. I even went back today and got another flavor of tangerine pineapple which equally blew my mind.   The barista is so good at what he does I think I am just going to have to say \"surprise me\" next time I go because he truly knows what he is doing. Best part of this experience is the personable customer service. They want nothing more than to satisfy the customer and it makes my day just going by there. I will probably go there every day if not every other day for as long as I am in Arizona.   GO TO KONA 13 COFFEE! YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DONT!!"}
{"text":"I've lived around this area my whole life and never knew this place existed until my friend told me about it! I was pleasantly surprised with how great it was, Tyler was very welcoming but not overly friendly, just super passionate about coffee and helping customers. My mom got the chocolate macadamia nut-infused cold brew with cream (I stole a sip... it had great flavor!) and I got the standard cold brew with cream. However, once I ordered it Tyler told me he makes three different homemade whipped creams every day - a fruity one, a dessert one, and a vanilla. He gave me a sample of the fruity one - which was lime blackberry that day - and it was DELICIOUS. Then I asked for the dessert one - which was buttercream flavor - to be put on my cold brew, and then I mixed it all up and it became one of the best coffee drinks I have ever had!  So, if you like cold brew that's creamy and a little sweet, try on with a whipped cream and mix it all together... it is incredible!"}
{"text":"Went to Kona today on a beautiful Sunday to get my car washed. Stopped in for an iced chai, Will suggested a dirty chai and it was awesome. Great drink, great service and perfect time when you get your car cleaned. I'm a believer haha"}
{"text":"Always have my car wash and coffee Wednesdays. Usually been grabing Dutch bros or Starbucks. I found my new oasis. The team is great there and love exploring flavors to make the best possible drink. I have to give 5 out of 5. The lemonade and the iced coffee flavors are spot on. Doesn't hurt that you can grab a quick car wash while your enjoying your beverage."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here sooner. It's super close to work and convenient to get to. You can stop inside or drive thru, which is what I prefer. They have the most friendly staff and take their time to make your order right. The last time I was there the staff gave me couple options and suggestions before I completed my order. They took the time to explain the menu items and find the perfect coffee for me. I recommend the vanilla macadamia nut cold brew with almond milk. They also have a lot of to different sugar free flavor options. If you're in the area and looking for a fast great tasting coffee defiantly check this place out. Looking forward to going back and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Prices are pretty good. They have the option of having a HUGE drink. I managed to have an iced coffee last me all day. The second time I went I had a Piña Colada smoothie and it was way too sweet though."}
{"text":"Employees were super friendly and helped me out with suggestions for coffee, I tried a blended RipTide and it was so painfully sweet, I couldn't taste any coffee. I actually had to drive back and see if I could get something else. He told me it comes in a syrup that way already made, and he really tried to see if he could make me something else. He was very nice about it and I appreciated it, but I declined. I would like to come back and try the coffee hot, since many people have commented on how great it is. I just don't think the iced version is my thing. Seems like a good location to sit outside or get your car washed after."}
{"text":"Awesome! We were in town from Seattle for the super bowl and came across this place. Their espresso is absolutely delicious and the baristas are so friendly. They also gave us tips about the areas to go while we're in town. I wish this place was in Seattle! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My new coffee spot! Drive thru service & good variety. Plus the barista waits for you to try the drink to make sure you like it."}
{"text":"I am a coffee purist - no cream, no sugar, no flavoring - and was not super impressed with their limited selection and quality of straight black coffee. They are also limited to store-bought snacks such as muffins, granola bars, and things of that nature. I would say that it would be unfair to compare this place to other coffee shops in the area because it is in more of a fast-food genre of coffee shops; it has a drive-through and is attached to a car wash. The service was great and the barista was friendly, nonetheless. Maybe next time I am in the area, I will try one of their signature Hawaiian coffee drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their coffee is delicious,they have so many flavor options and combinations and will make sure that you like your drink.  The best part about it is the people who work here..they are all so friendly and go far beyond great customer service. I look forward to coming here everyday because it just puts me in such a better mood and I can't tell if it's from the coffee or the people!"}
{"text":"Try the Dana it's Delicious.  The drinks are fabulous! I really like stopping by here while I'm waiting for my car to get cleaned at Wash Wizard. Every time that I have been here the staff are super friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing.   Looking forward to being a long-time customer. :D"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Everyone at the car wash and the drive thru for coffee is always so nice! Coffee is so much better than starbucks. Try the French press...vanilla Macadamia nut or diamond head. Soooo bomb! Also great drive thru car wash for the price."}
{"text":"This place is SO cute! I'm visiting from Chicago, and I love to go places where I can't go when I'm home (which i recommended to ANYONE vacationing! You can go to Wendy's or Starbucks at home, go somewhere unique to your vacation destination!). Anyway, this was adorable. I got a smoothie to start off, and I loved it. I had to get a blended pistachio coffee too. I was super patient with my order since he was busy, so he gave it to me on the house. SOOO sweet! I appreciated that since I want to save as much as I can on vacation. I probably will come back before my flight tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find for me, and I ended up having to circle the block behind it. It's actually attached to the car wash which is a pretty unique set-up. Going through the drive through, you go right for a wash or left for coffee, though there are signs once you get close enough.  Once I was in the right place, the woman manning the window was super nice and my iced mocha came out quick. As hinted in the name, everything is Hawaiian-themed and they use the Kona roast coffee for all their drinks. It's delicious! One of the better coffee drinks I've gotten in the east valley, no less from a car wash drive-thru. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come here often - maybe even pick it over Dutch Brothers, a favourite (but not local!) choice."}
{"text":"This place rocks and Chris knows his stuff. Keep up the outstanding service and great drinks."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. My boyfriend and I stopped by wash wizard and we ended up ordering here on our wait. I have heard great things about the place from other people but never had time to try it out. My boyfriend got a vanilla latte and I got the mango strawberry smoothie. His iced vanilla latte was incredible! They have so many different options, generous sizes, and really great prices. Chatted up with the guy who helped us out and turns out that they get their coffee imported from Hawaii (not surprised). It was a successful first trip and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I went here for a coffee date and the girl at the register was nice enough to give me a coupon for a free coffee on my next visit because it was my first visit. Two days later I decided I wanted coffee so I went and got the same drink I got the first time and the man at the register said that my coupon was only good for a plain coffee so I was charged $2.25. If you're going to give out free coffee coupons you should specify that they're not for any sort of specialty coffee and just a plain cup of coffee. I would not have gone out of my way to get a free cup of coffee in that case. Honestly if I'm going to pay for 5 or $6 for a cup of coffee I'd rather go to Dutch brothers any day. Sure, your product is about the same but the customer service at Dutch brothers blows you guys out of the water."}
{"text":"I don't like giving five-star reviews unless they're absolutely deserved... And Kona 13 really deserves it! They are absolutely spot on with their coffee which is great but their customer service is what puts them over the top. The young men and women that work there in the morning are always wonderful to me on my way to work. They hold great conversation, they make my coffee right and they always asked to make sure it taste right before I drive away. it's just really wonderful and refreshing to see people who truly care about their craft"}
{"text":"I love Kona! Not only is their coffee delicious, but their customer service is exceptional. Every employee I have interacted with is very pleasant and goes out of their way to ensure customer satisfaction. They always offer for me to try the drink I get after making it, to make sure that I'm happy with it. Plus, their prices are very fair. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"had a coconut and mocha blended really good nice outdoor seating area its next to a car wash they had several other types of drinks it seems like a nice little place to pass some time"}
{"text":"Unique flavors. Amazing baristas! Never in my life have I been offered flavored whipped cream!! Strawberry caramel whip! My mind was blown! New favorite spot hands down!"}
{"text":"I always stop in to have my car washed at the adjacent car wash and only recently stopped for an iced coffee. I wish I had stopped sooner, I would have been sipping on the yumminess while going through the car wash. Oh well, now I know."}
{"text":"Whenever I need to get my car washed on the weekend I come to Wash Wizard, and I've always known of the attached coffee shop but decided to give it a try this weekend. It recently changed over from the previous company and the guy who helped me out at the window was super pumped about their product and was very friendly. I made my own smoothie (peach, mango, & strawberry) and I opted to taste their homemade whipped cream before I got a bit on my smoothie. The smoothie was really good and he said that it was essentially just fruit (not a lot of additives which I appreciate). And I am not a whipped cream fanatic but there's was really good. Even though this place is so close to where I live I don't usually pass by, but I will definitely stop by if I'm in the mood for a smoothie or some coffee."}
{"text":"The Pina Colada smoothie was delicious!!!! Also, peach mango smoothie and strawberry mango with banana is very very good :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Tempe. Convenient drive thru. Excellent customer service.  Get the iced Pipeline."}
{"text":"Vanilla Mac hot coffee is the best! This one might take a bit of time because they use a French press, but it is well worth the wait. The service is great. Sometimes they will send you over to get a free car wash, or if you get a car wash, the car place will send you to get a free drink."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a whim, thinking they had wifi because it is a coffee/tea/smoothie spot and I learned that they didn't have wifi No biggie  The girl that helped me was nice and gave me the run down on the menu and the Flavors that she liked I went with a strawberry piña colada smoothie and it was really, really good  It was pretty cheap too, which made it even better  I sat at the table out front and enjoyed the smoothie The foam on top made my day I will have to stop by and try one of their coffees"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in the country!!!!  I travel a bunch and try out a lot of local coffee shops. I had always gone to the Scottsdale store but finally just tried the Tempe location. Ironically the manager from Scottsdale moved to Tempe. Crystal might be the best customer service manager in the country.   I showed up in the drive thru and she had remembered my name and my drink.   Consistency is important and my drink was as amazing as ever!  I tried one of their TSUNAMIS and omg. If you are looking for a kick in your .... and need a pick me up this is it. I was wide awake for my flight back the California."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Excellent. Excellent.   Was on this side of town for a meeting and the \"usual suspects\" at Tempe Marketplace were not open.  Pleasantly surprised with this find!  Owner was there and had a nice conversation about his business and expansion.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was blown away by how nice they were. Not like fake nice, either. They seemed so geniune about giving me the drink of my dreams. And with so many options, they can probably find yours, too!  So far I've had a mocha with butterscotch-banana (imagine Emma Stone's \"yum\" face here) whipped cream, iced green tea, and plain black iced coffee...all good in their very different ways.  The only reason they don't get the full 5 stars is because of the location. I can't really sit and enjoy my drink at a car wash. But for drive-thru drinks on the run, they can't be beat!"}
{"text":"When this place is good, it's GOOD. When it's bad, it's BAD.. and my biggest issue with Kona is the complete inconsistency. There is one barista who I like a lot, he makes really great tasting drinks and is very kind. But if he's not there, I want to run like the wind because I know for a fact it will be a waste of my money. I've had my drink, which is always an iced vanilla latte, at varying colors, temperatures, consistencies, and sweetness levels. I hate this inconsistency! If they just got down their recipe, they could be a really great coffee place. I know they have it in them. Which is why I give them a 3 star. If I had to review the good barista, it would be a full 5 star."}
{"text":"Great coffee and super friendly service!! I tried the coconut mocha today and it was delicious, not too sweet and had a nice subtle coconut flavor. I will be coming back to try their other drinks!! It's also a good deal price wise; the large is huge."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time trying kona 13's coffee, I ordered a medium iced shark bite and my friend had an Iced caramel macchiato. Both of these drinks were extremely delicious. But today, I ordered the exact same drinks.... first of all, the barista made them hot when I made sure to asked for them iced, then she just poured them over ice which tasted watered down and room temperature."}
{"text":"One would think that on any given day at 8am, when going to a coffee shop, there would actually be coffee. And when one asks for coffee, it does not mean an Americano. It, um, means coffee. I don't normally mock ones intelligence, but..actually I do mock, she was a moron."}
{"text":"Great little coffee stop in a neighborhood/area that needs something other than multiple vape shop options. Wasn't sure what to order my first time so the owner explained the menu and gave a few suggestions. It's definitely a mom-and-pop shop because he (the owner) is there all the time and there's just a few other girls I've seen in rotation when I've stopped by. Anyone who has worked has been nice to me and struck up a good/brief convo with me. It's definitely more local than even beloved Dutch Bros!  People need to be patient with Kona 13 because more than likely it's just one or two people working and they take pride in crafting drinks. The drive-thru is a great option for those in a bit of a rush.  I have yet to order anything besides the V-Mac [Vanilla Macadamia Nut] iced coffee because it is THAT. GOOD. However it is produced means that I don't need to add much or any SF vanilla and/or almond milk because the flavor is already in the coffee. It's also definitely got a good punch in the caffeine department."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. I tried two coffee drinks and one smoothie. I DO NOT recommend the smoothies. They are not made from real fruit, they are made from syrupy fruit mix from a carton and the smoothies are incredibly sweet. I had to dilute mine with water in order to drink it. The first coffee drink I got, Riptide w/ almond milk, was really sweet with helped cut the bitterness of the coffee but it was a little too sweet. The second one I got, Lucky 13 w/ almond milk, was not sweet enough it was just bland and bitter. The salted caramel whipped cream I got on top was nice. If i really really needed a coffee drink and I was closer to Kona 13 than Dutch Bros or one of the numerous new coffee placed out, I might consider coming here. Next time I'd try an iced tea or a different coffee drink."}
{"text":"Add Kona 13 to one of my favorite places in my new neighborhood!! Creative flavors, baristas who know their stuff. Tried the Tiramisu flavor today, and am going to go down the list and try everything!"}
{"text":"This place has outdoor seating and it's right next to a car wash. I really love their drinks. The large is such a deal. It's a hugeee cup and definitely worth $5. I love the taste and the service is really quick.   Definitely will return to kona! :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it first opened. I am not much of a coffee drinker, but I love their teas! On those days where I need the caffeine, I like their coffee better than any others I have tried. The staff is always very friendly and has great recommendations for drinks to try. Do yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff (but not overly chatty like Dutch Bros), average prices for a specialty coffee drink, delicious coffee and very generous sizes for the price! I used a $5 for $10 special offered through Yelp. There was $.50 that was my responsibility to pay, but the guy said not to worry about it, so I just tipped him instead for being awesome.   Ordered the large or 'Big Kahuna' blended Lucky 13 (Irish Creme) and blended Maui Waui (Coconut Mocha). Husband and I nursed those large drinks through the early afternoon. They were so good!   It's a bit out of our way to visit, but worth the drive. Eager to return and try other flavors and hopefully try something that includes whipped cream (since I read that it's homemade)."}
