{"text":"Don't be fooled by the location of this coffee shop (at the back of another store), I have yet to savor such a wonderful coffee! I never could stand drinking coffee without sugar...with LaFormule, I don't want sugar to ruin the taste of the latte!!!  The barrista there is an artist and is as obsessed with coffee as were alchemist with finding the philosopher's stone and for good reason, the end-product is as precious as gold. Plus, the origin of the coffee beans changes every few days so you never get bored with the taste (which is unlikely to begin with). No visit to Montreal would be complete without trying this place."}
{"text":"Bravo John pour ce superbe endroit. Une attention particulière est portée pour chaque café. One of the best Hidden spot in Town."}
{"text":"This place was expensive and I found the owners overly friendly. I ordered a filter coffee and paid over $3. After it was made the owner told me it was strawberry flavored, which I wish he would have specified earlier. Baked goods here are not very good either."}
{"text":"I must admit I've never met anyone as passionate for coffee as the owner of this place. That passion reflects very well in the quality and delicious drinks he prepared for my friend and I. After our visit to Quebec city and before departing Montreal,  we yelped a few coffee shops where we could rejoice from our newly discovered hobby: sipping on mocchas and lattes. Needless to say,  Jon prepared us something out of his menu and it turned out so delicious.  If I could describe that experience with words,  I would.  But like he said,  it was the coffee and not the chocolate that made this drink a star and I still can't forget the magical flavor in my mouth. And no sugar was added to my surprise!! The owner and his wife were such a pleasure to meet and we will definitely recommend all locals and travelers to try this place. My friend and I ended up buying some coffee in the hopes to recreate the experience,  but that's wishful thinking. Thank you again for making our Montreal experience complete!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in every sense! I didn't discover it until two weeks ago because it's located at the rear of a candy/ice cream shop. The space is calm and airy, and the espresso is really, really nice. I've been able to try something different every time I go, which is really nice and whomever is working is always eager and able to tell you about what you're enjoying. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The setting isn't ideal but this little espresso bar is full of charm, with a very hospitable welcome. Worth a cup if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great place! I'll be the first to admit, when I drink my coffee I need creamers, whipped cream, caramel, all that caloric goodness! I read some good reviews on yelp so i decided to try it, the owner told me that they had a special coffee from Guatemala, and he described it beautifully. This was the first time in my life that i had a latte that had only milk (no sugar or extra calories) and it was sweet, delicious, and creamy. I'm not from Montreal, but when i'm back i'll head back there. I would highly recommend this to anyone, but especially to tourists like myself who want a really nice treat as they tour this fantastic city!"}
{"text":"If you aren't looking for this place, you will miss it, guaranteed. And that would be a tragedy.  Hidden away at the back of Bons Scoops is one of the best places for coffee in Montreal. The baristas are super friendly and the coffee beans change on a regular basis. The place is small and there isn't a ton of seating (a few two-person tables, a communal table, and some bar seating), but it's relaxed and inviting.  One of the only places to get good coffee downtown. Sadly, it will be closing at the end of July =("}
{"text":"Great place!  I have been looking for a local coffee shop in the West part of Sainte-Catherine and I think I just found a place to frequent regularly. I had the chance to discuss with John, the owner, and his passion for coffee really transposed in the taste of my Americano.  I strongly encourage anyone in search of a good coffee place to check it out. Don't be fooled by the candy shop, the Formule Espresso Bar is there in the back. Hopefully, they will get the success it deserves.  Long live La Formule Espresso Bar!"}
{"text":"It's almost like a specialty coffee speak easy. Tucked inside a candy store it would have been easy to miss had it not been for the recent write ups. I got a coffee shot which was behind great and blew my expectations of what espresso can be. John was super nice and knowledgable, next time you're in the neighborhood check out this shop."}
{"text":"La Formule is so amazing! One of the best independent coffee shops in Montreal and a much-needed delicious coffee place  for the W. Ste Catherine area. They are inside Scoops Candy Shop at the back. It's an adorable atmosphere and John and Maggy really have a passion for coffee. They bring out flavors I didn't even know coffee had! This will for sure be my new regular coffee stop!"}
{"text":"Location: On Ste. Catherine West, past Fort. Don't be fooled - these guys are located inside a candy store so it's easy to miss them! Street parking available (metered), and the closest subways are Guy and Atwater. You can walk from there.   The place: Considering La Formule is sitting at the back of a candy store, they've got a pretty snazzy set-up! It's spacious, well-lit, urban and totally casual. There is limited seating though, so  it's probably more of a to-go place, unless you're lucky enough to snag a seat at the communal table, or the bar area.   The coffee: First of all, they use Pilot, which is one my new favourite roasters (out of TO). Secondly, the owner knows his coffee and can enlighten you on each roast that Pilot offers (and that he carries) while simultaneously explaining the difference between an espresso and an Americano. Finally, he takes his sweet time in preparing each cup of coffee, and delivers nothing short of excellence. While the Macchiato isn't on the menu, it was no problem ordering one and frankly, I enjoyed every minute of it. I do wish Macchiatos came in extra large cups =-D  Service: Excellent. The owner is super friendly and chatty, and puts out the most awesome vibe ever. I plan to stop in frequently - but when it's not -102 out there.   Price point: On par with other third wave shops in town."}
{"text":"This place was great! The owner was very friendly and welcoming. You can see he has a passion for coffee which is great cause you know you're going to get a well made cup of coffee! The actual flavour was super yummy. They change the flavour every few days which is really neat. They had flavours I never imagined could be in coffee. I'll be back to try the different flavours for sure. I didn't think this little place in the back of a candy store would be any good but I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great coffee and nice owner! Must recommend.  Dont be fooled by an asian lady at the front with a convenience store! Must walk inside. Very cool cafe. Nice guy who recommended stuff to do around since im not from mtl."}
{"text":"Best place for great coffee. John, the barista's, passion is coffee and its spills over into his carefully pulled espresso.  I enjoy hanging out, talking coffee and trying the various direct trade roasts from Pilot coffee roasters out of T.O. The single origin bean offerings switches up the every other day or so and keeps things interesting."}
{"text":"I adore this place!!!  A real hidden treasure,  literally hidden in a candy shop. This is my go to place for coffee now.  Great beans (Pilot),  tasty pastries (Regal Matinal),  awesome attention to detail,  lovely ambiance,  I really can't ask for more.    La Formule is run by John \"the coffeegeek\", a cool passionate guy who loves his coffee and Maggie his charming sweet wife.  You never know what to expect.  A few weeks back, we were treated to an impromptu jam session.  Last Sunday,  the baker celebrated his 1 year anniversary.    Definitely a must try. I always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my wife before we left Montreal. Jon, the owner, was extremely pleasant! He spoke very highly of his coffee, and the passion was clear in the cup of coffee he made for us. I highly recommend this place I you're a coffee aficionado!  By the way, the shop is in the back of a candy store, so don't be fooled by the store front when you see tons of candy through the window."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee made with extreme passion! I visited this cafe three times over a weekend. Every morning I was welcomed by John, and he even opened the cafe doors early on a Saturday morning so we could get our flat white fix.   On a side note, John and Maggie are true inspirations to the dreamers who want to own a cafe. They love their craft, enjoy greeting their visitors, and make wonderful coffee. Their motto is make what you love and enjoy what you serve. From the pastries made by a local baker to the beautiful furniture in the back of a candy shop (location of the cafe), everything is handpicked and displays their mission of sourcing materials from others with the same passion/love for their work. I wish this couple the best of luck on their new venture. I will absolutely be back when I come back up to Montreal.    Best,  Gary from Somerville (Boston)"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place!   The coffee is amazing, the atmosphere is great, the owners are very friendly, the service is quick.    They change coffee's every few days and you can taste the different blends. This place is perfect for those who are coffee aficionados or people who just really like a good cup of coffee like me.    I can't say enough good things about this place, if you have one espresso bar to visit in Montreal, this is the one."}
