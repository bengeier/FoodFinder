{"text":"Pre made toppings tasted like frozen.. Overall just not good value and taste way under par. Skip this place and go to Jimmy Guacos or Fat Bastard for a burrito you won't be disappointed with!"}
{"text":"This place is a lost cause. The only person was (Indian descent) and had no clue on hot to make a taco or burrito. He seemed lost and insecure on what to do   This should not be a visited place for anyone looking for a quick Mexican bite. Stay away."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are actually very good here. They have a nice, crispy texture with over 50 different flavour combinations. However, the Mexican food (which should be their specialty) leaves a lot to be desired. The meat is lacking in flavour and seems a bit stale. Also, the salsa seems to be the store bought Tostitos brand from a jar, which does not taste very good. In terms of price, I find that it's more affordable than Mucho Burrito for example, but the quality of the food is definitely not as good."}

One star, one visit.........never EVER would I go again.

I enjoy a big, gluttonous burrito like everyone.
It is what I've come to expect, big, heavy, filling, yummy in my tummy.
Not the case when it comes to this place.

Popped in Friday night since it was close to home. Was really looking forward to a great burrito place that was in my area. I was VERY disappointed.
 
My LARGE burrito was not LARGE in my opinion. Steak strips were steak cubes!
I must say, I laugh when places market themselves as cheaper than the competition, yet everything is \"extra.\" My steak burrito came to $10, more than I would have spent at Big Bite Burritos ($8.99 LRG) and Fat Bastard Burritos ($9.39 LRG). So not only did it cost more, the portion was far less than the competition.

This place is SOOOOOOO  cheap on toppings. The amount of cheese they put on my burrito was laughable. I honestly wish I walked out. And after trying the burrito I can tell you my wife wishes I did indeed walk out. 

What also kills me is for a new place you think they would want to make customers happy.
The woman working at the store was very polite, that I can say. But they are simply cheap.
My wife likes her burrito with chicken, rice, lettuce, and cheese. EVERY place I've ever gone to has added extra rice, or additional cheese as my wife's burrito is very simple. NOT HERE ! Again her LARGE burrito was laughable.

Honestly go elsewhere, burrito places are everywhere and this place simply doesn't cut it. 
The size, the price, the cheapness, just take your money to the competition and be happy.

I will never EVER EVER go back, nor would I suggest anyone tries these guys out."}
