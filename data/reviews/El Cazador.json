{"text":"Bad service which completely destroyed the whole experience for myself and the rest of my family,  but the food was great however and if they could fix their service problem this restaurant would be a must go to"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but sadly, the service was poor. The server, Martha seemed annoyed from the time I walked in. Unfortunately, the food did not taste good either. I would not recommend to anyone. Thank you."}
{"text":"The waitresses are by far the best here. I go at least twice a month with my family as they have seen my children grow up and it feels like family. I always grab some tostadas de ceviche as an appetizer. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic mexican food and respectable prices."}
{"text":"Picked up a sea food tostadas lunch for us. The octopus was very tender, little on the pricey side but worth it. Surprised that they do seafood do well considering our distance from the ocean. Well very likely return when we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered a drink that I stumbled upon at another restaurant by accidentally mixing horchata and Jamaica and I really like this drink.   I ordered it at this restaurant and the server, who was Diana made faces at me and asked if I was sure that was what I wanted and I said yes, that's what I asked for.   Then when she brought my drink she told my friend that speaks Spanish that she has never made a drink like that and laughed about it.  Her attitude completely ruined my experience.  I couldn't even enjoy my food (which was good) because of her facial expressions and remarks.  And I must say, that she shouldn't speak in Spanish to my friend and belittle me.  Have the nerve to say it to me in English, so I can defend myself."}
{"text":"Grilled shrimp meal is unbelievably good!!  Highly recommend!  We stumbled onto this restaurant and were very happily surprised. Good service, good food, good value!"}
{"text":"Went there on a slow Sunday with some hiking buddies.  The place is more appealing inside.  Nice warm atmosphere that can accommodate larger groups.  The menu has plenty of choices and the food is good though not excellent  I had the California Burrito which is vegetarian but I also added chicken. Complimentary salsa and chips.  Beer and wine only and those are limited in choices. Pleasant service.   OVerall a good experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My mix fajitas were burn and rice was awful. Not only that service terrible she took our order and never came back to ask if we needed something else. I had to get up and get her from behind the counter she was just talking abc having a drink instead of working. I will never be back here the waitress was so lazy. $50 dollars for a piece of s.... Food"}
{"text":"This place is very authentic the food the atmosphere AND lunch prices are good.  The food is good quality. All the staff was helpful and friendly.    The food is amazing!  From free chips and salsa to my entree.  Muy delicioso.  I don't speak Spanish but this place made me try.  Check out my pictures to get an idea.    If you are in North Las Vegas drop by.  It's not the easiest place to find but we'll worth the hunt."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place. Food was verygood. Clean establishment with a wide variety of food on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a mexican food nut and this place was recommended to me by a Latino friend.   The fajitas are incredible, chips, salsa and guac are homemade - everything is fresh and authentic.   Having the live mariachi singers only adds to the atmosphere.   Services was good, prices were fair, no complaints."}
{"text":"If I could drive me there everyday trust and believe I would! The campechana is the best in town!!! My husband looooves the the shrimp any type!!! The oysters are amazing and the margaritas and micheladas  are very good! They have authentic Mexican seafood I've never tried the other plates but my friends have and I don't see them complaining they wipe that plate. Service is really good as well."}
{"text":"What an incredible find. Awesome pazole and chorizo and eggs. Great service, wonderful atmosphere, air-conditioned Nicely."}
{"text":"What a great place...found by accident when we got lost looking for a venue...but boy did it surprise went back every day for breakfast every day. The cal do due Cameron was a great cure for the hangover and tacos were the best."}
{"text":"This was the most sub standard, horrible Mexican of my entire life. I ordered the grilled Cornish hen and what they delivered was two dollars worth of trash dark meat, almost raw fries( weird side dish), and unbelievably bad rice and beans. I wouldn't deserve that food to my worst enemy. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Excelente lugar para comer,comida recien hecha,ambiente tranquilo,deliciosos pescados que en otros lugares no lo encuentra. He comido en los restaurantes de esta area mas de una vez y me ha dejado mal sabor,mi favoriti sera El Cazador Restaurant,se los recomiendo."}
{"text":"Tomato soup with a crab leg and seafood.  added lime and hot sauce to help taste there was nothing fascinating about it.    But that salsa was the bomb, i could have been satisfied with the chips and salsa.   The bathroom was clean.   The table we sat at was two small tables put together and they kept moving, man I almost burned myself with the soup when table moved. Phew that wouldn't have been pretty."}
{"text":"We were passing through Vegas on our way to Zion National Park. The Vegas strip isn't really our scene so we drove north of town looking for Mexican cuisine. Very happy with the food, service and atmosphere here. Very nice bathrooms. Would love to return but we live in Wisconsin :)"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It's a small joint. The service was great. I had shrimp empanadas. We ordered guacamole for the table and some shrimp ceviche. Everything was so good. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here. Everything was great. My enchilada plate was delicious and my husband ate every bite of his taco plate!! The staff was very nice and friendly. The restaurant is festively decorated and also kept very clean. It was also really great to get Bohemia beer for only $3.50 each! Great beer prices!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving chips and salsa near my work for lunch this is the place to go to.  If you're not a fan of spicy, caution the salsa.  However I love it, just the right amount of kick. We normally go during lunch time so a variety of things to choose from their lunch menu (11am-2pm).  If I had to choose something not from the lunch menu, it would be the shrimp diabla, once again another spicy dish.  There are plenty of Mexican restaurants to choose from around this area of town, but I always return here."}
{"text":"The Mexican food was absolutely delicious, very good proportion and a very pleasant staff"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food, good prices. Excellent service. If you go you must try camarones a la diabla. This dish is amazing!!!! They have authentic Mexican beers as well as aguas frescas such as Jamaica, orchata, and pi√±a. Their fried ice cream is the best! You must try it! If you like good Mexican food this is the place to go!"}
