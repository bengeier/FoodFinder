{"text":"The average tasting sushi and friendly service was totally undone by the nearly hour long wait to get our food after ordering. The place isn't very big and was not busy when we place our order so the wait, in my opinion, was totally unjustified.  Nice, clean and fairly priced...but way too slow."}
{"text":"We love this place. The atmosphere was really nice. The service was excellent. The miso soup and house salad (or side salad) are delicious. Every sushi roll is delicious. Our favorite is Red Koi sushi roll. This place is great! Love it."}
{"text":"Red Koi became my favorite Sushi spot on the first visit. The menu is full of yummy, and the prices are very reasonable. The staff are polite and friendly. The location is easy to miss, behind Jack in the Box on Ray & Power.  If you like good food, for a good price, from friendly people, give it a try.   Hint: they do to go orders pretty fast. And the portions are impressive. Next time you are shopping in the area, call in a take out order. (so I can hog up the Sushi bar)"}
{"text":"Red (Aka Red Koi) has made a huge change and a huge mistake. I've been a loyal customer for several years now, coming in almost weekly. The new look.. Is okay. The new menu.. Horrible. No more miso soup, no more options for kids, no more plain edamame, no more Arizona roll, no more Godzilla roll.. Almost every single item that my daughter and I came here for is now gone. We are here at the moment waiting for our Pho.. If this has changed.. Sadly, we won't be coming back. If the previous owners are out there and have a new location.. Please tell me where!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Japanese restaurant ever visited, from San Francisco to Phoenix, and in between.     Super selection from all the Sushi, teriyaki , etc, but the best is all the unique and extensive speciality rolls.   My favorite is the \"Bayou Gumbo Roll\".  Semi-spicy with some very special items such as crawfish.  We found them from a review in the ARIZONA REPUBLIC NEWSPAPER, food review section.   They were given a very excellent review, and I know agree there were correct.  We have been several times and the food never changes.   It is interesting that the name on their card doesn't have the word \"Koi\" in the name, but it's the correct address."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had, hands down. I have had better sushi from a grocery store. Sashimi salmon was hard and no flavor. Triple threat roll was stale tasting and the spicy tuna in it was brown colored and hard as if it came from a spoiled can of tuna. Also got the fried calamari which was like rubber and had no flavor at all. Top it all off with terrible service and I can honestly say this was my worst sushi experience ever."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there when we are craving Japanese food and do not want to drive too far from the house.  The restaurant is very kid friendly for our 3 year old... He enjoys the kids meal...  The sushi is just \"so so\".....we have had much better, but also worse.  The wait staff are friendly and the service has been prompt on our visits (normally weeknights)....  We will continue to frequent Red Koi."}
{"text":"This place dominates! After the catastrophic menu change at Pei Wei (we'll never go back) my wife and I have been adrift looking for casual, spicy, light, flavorful Asian cuisine in the Mesa/Gilbert area. Tried Red Koi on a lark and bingo! Flavors and presentation are top-notch. Tried their HeartBURRRRN roll - spiciest sushi I have ever had - and amazingly delicious. We both had the spicy sticky noodle dishes - her beef and me shrimp - absolutely delicious with beautiful presentation. If you liked the now-deceased Spicy Korean at Pei Wei, you'll love this. This place rules. Go there. Now. No really."}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of 8 expecting a typical sushi place.   Instead, we had an entire menu of sushi and sashimi PLUS a full menu of Vietnamese cuisine to choose from! They accommodated our party right away.  The waiter was very attentive. Everything was delicious - hot food arrived hot, cold food was cold, all sauces were wonderful...Even the littlest one found something on the menu. Delicious, and we will all be going back."}
{"text":"I went into this place for the first time and I thought it was really good.  I ordered the chicken Katsu combination. I also ordered california rolls that were good since I don't eat sushi. My husband had the terriaki chicken and thought my food was better even though his was still good. I would go there again. The Sushi chef was nice too. The only think that I didn't like was that they gave me one \"not full small bowl\" of rice and I asked for more and they charged me. I have never been to a place that charged extra for rice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Not just Japanese food.  Such variety and attention to detail.  Wide variety of sake and Asian beers.  $7 dollar lunch specials pho and bento boxes.  Soooo clean inside.  One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Just had Happy Hour at Red, WOW! Great food and HUGE menu Tempura Shrimp and vegetables was fresh hot and amazing! I'll be dining here eating my way through the menu as often as I can! Super nice staff! Nice clean friendly environment near Gateway Airport I thoroughly and firmly endorse this restaurant as a refreshing dining experience in the East Valley. Sushi looked Amazing I'll have a \"money roll\" next time I'm in a seat at Red!"}
{"text":"Smells and sushi does not appear to be fresh.  Staff not friendly.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I will preface my review by noting that I am a Japanese American, and have lived in Southern California for most of my life.  Sushi bars are on nearly every other street corner in some parts of Orange County, and I've had my fair share of excellent, and terrible sushi.  This is the best Japanese place we've found in eastern Gilbert.  Is it authentic?  The owners are not Japanese, but this is darn near as close to the real thing as I'm going to find in AZ.  I've been to this restaurant multiple times with my husband.  We usually go on a weekday just after work, around 5:30, to take advantage of happy hour (served until 6pm).  There's always at least one or two other tables already filled, no matter what day we go.    Notes on price/serving size:  1) It's a restaurant that sell sushi, which must be FRESH, else risk poisoning your patrons.  Since this is AZ, fresh ingredients are expensive to obtain.  Some ingredients are difficult to find locally, and must be imported.  For these reasons, the price will be higher than other types of restaurants.  No matter where you live, expect to pay more for sushi than a burger joint.  2) Sushi restaurants in general have small portions.  Even if you eat until you are stuffed, an hour or two later you will not doubt feel snack-ish.  This is because rice expands in your stomach, making you feel full.  If you want more for your money, order chicken, beef, or sashimi, and limit your rice intake.  Don't like fish?  Pregnant?  No problem.  There are plenty of other things on the menu at this restaurant other than raw fish.  If you enjoy noodles, their Pho is quite good, and I always enjoy the udon, which comes with a little slice of Kamaboko, something that is VERY difficult to find around these parts.  They also have an impressive selection maki (rolled) sushi to choose from.  I did not care as much for the teriyaki bowl; the sauce is not as sweet as I was expecting, but the vegetables were fresh and very good.  Why not 5 stars, you ask?  Once in awhile, the waitress gets my order slightly wrong.  But, the food is so good that I don't call her on it.  No matter what they put in front of me, I'm going eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"I would rate this as an OK spot for sushi. Ambiance was nice but sushi was average quality and prices were a little higher than other places around. In a pinch I would come back, but would choose other locations first. Happy hour pricing was decent but still more expensive than other spots."}
{"text":"My wife and I live for sushi! We eat it everywhere. We ran into this place and tried it out. We enjoyed it. Everything we are was good! Plus, they have chopped wasabi! That it a huge plus to us!!"}
{"text":"I had Katsu Curry lunch here! The rice was not fulfilling but enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Rolls are much smaller when ordering takeout. I ordered the princess roll which cost $15 and it wasn't worth the money spent! Sushi tasted warm and not cold like it should be. They are really greedy with the pickled ginger and wasabi- I've eaten in and rolls were much bigger! Disappointed this time around! Red Koi be consistent and stop being stingy with your sushi, ginger and wasabi!!! I definitely won't be returning to this spot!"}
{"text":"This has been out 4th outing at red koi and in those 4 we always were greeted and served in the best possible manner. Other local resturaunts should take note as to how to run a resturaunt. Food is top notch and of a good variety. Pricing is deffinetly fair. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"pretty good... we went there once and the food wasn't that good.  but we have gone back and the food was better must have just been an off night.  everything is yummy.  the dishes are better then the sushi!  we breing our kids every time so very kid friendly."}
{"text":"First visit here and was not impressed. The sushi in pretty low quality, my wife's noodle dish was basically spaghetti with soy sauce and the service was awful. I'm pretty sure they didn't really want us there. Here's the deal, this area is up and coming and there are good restaurants everywhere, this place won't be around much longer if they don't step it up. Skip it, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Use to go here at least once a week but customer service became awful and there is better sushi and customer service else where. I no longer go there even though I live close."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing pho, looking for a place that's closer to east mesa to replace Saigon in chandler. The service is amazing, I don't know how many times I've asked for tea and my server just kept it coming! Love this place."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fine but nothing special. I placed an order for pick up. I had looked up the menu on two different websites. I ordered three roles to share with my husband and it was suppose to total $20. When I got there it was $28. When I told them that the prices online were different they just said they changed the menu recently. I asked if they had a menu I could take with me they said no. I don't think we will be back. There are better sushi places for the same price."}
{"text":"Another one bites the dust.  They have just changed ownership yet again; but this time might finally do them in.  Our beloved sushi spot with the freshest salmon and tuna in town is now a *gasp* Vietnamese restaurant! They were smart to keep a few of the old Red Koi house rolls: Alaska, ASU, Tootsie... But they were wildly different in taste, freshness and preparation.  The menu was not appetizing; and everything is fried twice or swimming in a funky greasy sauce.  Shame.  We will just stop going here and stick with our 2nd favorite, Osaka, up on Baseline. And finally, I am writing this sad review from my WC.  If that is any indication... Never again!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for takeout and picked up yellowtail nigiri and a princess roll.  The staff were polite and my food was ready on time. The restaurant looks clean as did the kitchen from what I could see. The sushi was fresh but portions very small. The roll was actually tiny in diameter. Not much food for more than $20. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good happy hour!. Liked the red wasabi. Good rolls. We had the triple threat and las. vegas.  Don't live in the area but woulda eat here again if I was near."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place in Gilbert. There is a great variety of sushi, and non sushi items, and the food is consistently good. I always bring sushi lovers here, and they always want to come back.  The only reason I gave 1 star is because my husband, who does not like sushi, was not a fan of the teriyaki. I agree that it was bland."}
{"text":"Loved the Sushi Bar!  The food was fab.  This was an upper scale establishment.  Then they eliminated the bar and remodeled.   So sad, not the same experience."}
{"text":"Flew into town on Christmas Day.  Starving and on a chance we stopped by to see if they were open.  Yay they were, and busy.  Guess we weren't the only hungry folks on Christmas."}
{"text":"Either the fish are smaller or they aren't making their food cost. Sashimi slices 1/2 the size of any other place I've eaten . Same for the rainbow roll...no longer a good value....this isn't Tokyo or San Francisco where the fish is so fresh it's worth it. Save your money."}
{"text":"Good sushi. The high school waitress did not want to be there at all.  With all the options around town, it not worth it to have dinner around another grumpy teen.  Very bad service...  too bad.."}
{"text":"Ate here once. As a big pho fan, I'm glad there's a place within 5 miles in Gilbert. I ordered Pho Thai( - noodle soup with raw thin round eye beef normally)The soup was great, but the meat was not right. Not thin cut as it should be, didn't taste right as the other VN place. Not round eye beef, it was cooked thick small pieces, Cost $10, really not what I wanted. The waitress was hiding all the time. Had to go behind the wall \"knock knock\" whatever you want, even for check to pay."}
{"text":"I went to Red Koi yesterday because I was off from work and really craving some sushi.  I didn't want to spend too much money so I thought I would try this place.  The rolls are pretty overpriced so I stayed away from them and actually ordered their Bento Box lunch.  For $7.50 you can order an entree dish and it comes with 4 pieces of California roll, salad, and white rice.  You can add another entree dish for $2.50.    So I ordered Shrimp Tempura and Chicken Teriyaki.  It came with three Shrimp tempura and a small bowl of chicken teriyaki.  The Shrimp Tempura was good.  The Chicken teriyaki was a little dry but if you sopped up the teriyaki sauce that was in the bottom of the bowl it was okay.  The teriyaki sauce was actually pretty flavorful and I wish the chicken had more of the teriyaki flavor.  The small salad was fresh and the ginger dressing was delicious.  The California roll was good as well.  They put a lot of crab and it was just a thin layer of rice which was a nice departure from those sushi rolls that seem to be all rice!  Presentation of my food was pretty great.  Very clean and everything separated on the plate which is great for someone with OCD.    Service was okay.  I didn't really have a main server.  Seemed as if it was two people just taking care of everyone which seemed to work for the lunch crowd.   The restaurant is clean and has a laid back atmosphere.  Also the bathroom are clean as well.    I'll definitely come back and try more of the sushi when budget allows."}
{"text":"Sorry to hear others have had less than fantastic experiences. I've been several times and enjoyed each one very much. Anytime I have wanted to add or remove/substitute anything regarding rolls it has always been welcomed by the sushi chef. I have never had table service here so I can't comment on that. Someone commented on the portion sizes being too small???? I would consider her too glutonous. Its sushi not Big Betty's BBQ pit."}
{"text":"So sad this was such a bad experience tonight since unfortunately there is not much competition in the area.  The service was horrible, didn't bring waters, wasabi or ginger until we asked for it twice and halfway way through our meal. Charged us for everything, including a side of siracha and a side of jalepeno slices. The menu said to try the fresh wasabi with no mention of a charge and then charged $2 for a tiny side. Waitress didn't understand or speak English, didn't write down our order so she put it in wrong and then charged us for the wrong roll she put in? Also, she didn't understand that we wanted our $150 tab split 3 ways (50/50/50?) and put random amounts on all of our cards.  Sushi was ok. Not bad, not great.  Overall experience was not great.  For the price and the customer service I will DEFINITELY not be back. I'll drive a little farther to go to another sushi restaurant in Chandler or Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just got back from Red Koi in Mesa.  Food was OK, prices were not.  Furthermore, I received a coupon from them in the mail a couple weeks ago, which happened to expire several days ago.  When the server took the coupon to the manager to see if they could honor it, the manager refused.  I'm sorry, but Red Koi is a new restaurant, trying to get new customers in there.  My fiance and I went there for our first time and they cant honor a coupon that expired just a few days ago?   I work in this industry, and restaurants are hurting right now.  Turning away new customers is bad business, and thus we wont be going back there again.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the Mesa/Gilbert area that treat their customers better."}
{"text":"Horrible ownership, my family drove 20 mins and showed up almost 30 mins before closing time to see the lights get turned off abd doors locked as we pulled up. We called and they awnsered and said sorry but they closed early tonight. Very unprofessional and bad buisness. We will only go again unless we can't get a refund for our Groupon we purchased. I do not recommend this inconsiderate buisness."}
{"text":"I've been here before and after the remodel. The food was excellent then and I thought today it was still pretty good. Not sure I like the new layout. They took away the bar and my girlfriend and I are definitely barflies. The service has always been pretty crappy. Still was today. Nice people. They just don't know the menu and they are absent. Anyway, we will be back for the food. Hopefully they will work on service."}
{"text":"I really do love Red Koi, but since the prices went up...maybe six months ago we don't go there as often. they redecorated and the menu changed a bit, but the food is consistently amazing! Service is iffy, depends on who you get. I wish we could do it every weekend like we used to, but it's more of a special treat now."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch today and did not enjoy this place at all. We stopped in thinking the lunch menu would fill us up and be a decent price but it was quite the opposite.  Only sweetened green tea is available so it already lost authenticity points with us off the bat. The lunch specials were reasonable in price but a bit limited. Once we made our choices we couldn't believe how tiny the portions were.  A tiny cup of salad and a formed puck of rice the size of a can of shoe polish with some tasteless California rolls for my wife's \"meal\". My wife is the least picky person I know but stated that she had better California rolls at Fry's Grocery store that had more flavor.  I actually timed how long it took me to eat my curry - 1 Minute:17 seconds and I was scraping the plate for a single grain of rice. For that and 2 teas was $25 dollars + tip on top.  Needless to say we will never return to this place as the prices were too high and the portions were laughable.  The only reason I didn't give them 1 star was because the (whole 5 bites worth) of Curry was excellent and very authentic to a true Japanese curry as it would be served in Japan (only in tiny snack sized portions)."}
{"text":"Can I give 3.5? I do like it. I've been there 3 times and on my birthday too. Maybe I should give it a 4 for Gilbert. Anyway... I like it enough to keep going back the sushi is ok. I'll get it carefully. But I get it carefully ANYWHERE in Arizona. It's the desert. I really go for the Pho. It's not great but it's good and it's about 4 miles from my home! I typically drive about 20 miles to Dobson in Mesa to get Pho. So this tastes really good.  Regarding the service. No, it's not bubbly and overly friendly you're not at TGI Fridays but they get the job done.  I think it's just called Red now."}
{"text":"we went for lunch. their lunch bento box specials are a good value. their salad dressing was excellent and the ca rolls were yummy. good value for Japanese food which usually costs a lot more. i would definitely come here again. its close to my house and their food is delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Red for about 3 years and we love it! We moved about 6 miles father away from Red, but still choose to come back after trying places closer to our new house. The food is AMAZING! Yes they remodeled it and changed up the menu a little, but still same great food. Every guest we ever bring loves the atmosphere and the food. Try the garlic tuna roll and ASU Roll, delicious!"}
{"text":"Just frist times we came here we Oder combination Pao is good soup !! Hot  soup.  I love there service. But the light is too low"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed out visit to Red Koi. We went on a Sunday evening shortly after they opened  (at 5:00pm on Sundays). There were only two other tables dining when we came in. Our waiter was really friendly, but not overbearing.  The menu is good, we were able to pick from happy hour specials as well as the full menu. I got the small sashimi plate, seaweed salad and the shrimp and vegetable tempura. For dessert, I got the mango mousse cake for dessert. My husband and I also split the eel and white tuna nigiri. It was all really good, fresh, delicious.   I also thought the prices and portion sizes were competitive, very reasonable for Japanese. My husband got beef yakisoba and it was a nice big portion. With my meal, my husband's dinner, his cheesecake (which he said was very good) for dessert, and a carafe of sake, our total was $57. But we had really a lot of food.  It was great, and the atmosphere was really nice. I heard some Zero 7 and something from the Tron soundtrack, so they tend to play low key electronic music, very nice. My husband and I will definitely be going again, this was a nice find."}
{"text":"Great spicy edamame is to die for!  This is the best sushi in the east valley for sure.  If I'm wrong please let me know.  I would like the challenge."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile now and still love the food at Red Japanese Restaurant.  My husband orders the Saki garlic clams!  I love the Odon  soup and red jspanese roll! !!   Yummy!  Food is great and so is the service!"}
{"text":"First time here and last time coming. The place wasn't busy at all. 2 waitress were working tonight. Idk what took so long for food to come out, it took about 40 min for my food to come out and the portion was crazy small for 10 whole bucks. Not worth it. The food tasted not so great, I ask the waitress if they have  sriracha for more taste. She said \"yes we do\" she never came back with it. I was starving so I just finished it. Idk if she just thought If I had a question whether or not they have sriracha. I WANTED SRIRACHA.  Never been to a restaurant and left hungry before. First time for everything right? Shame on me if I come back again"}
{"text":"This place is \"OK...\" its nice on the inside and they have a cool fish tank filled with African Cichlids and Peacocks.  Happy hour seems like a good deal, but its really not, just a few bucks off and nothing really special on the menu...  Also the portions were small...  People seem to like this place, but I've found better in the area, with way better prices...  if someone wanted to go here, I would, but it wouldn't be my pick!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's close to home and everyone leaves with a smile in there face.  Resctable pho and shushi.  Good food, beer and wine.  Broad menu for a family run shushi resturant."}
{"text":"Ok sushi. Here are a couple things I didn't like: no sushi sheet and pencil, soy dipping dish too small, and salad not served with sushi. I wouldn't go back. I like the place in queen creek."}
{"text":"I don't like Sushi so I'm surprised I like this place. Love the Las Vegas and Tootsie Roll sushi and the red shrimp appetizer, which are all delicious. The fried rice is a rip off though. They won't let you order a side of fried rice - you have to get it in an entree, which is $10. Who doesn't offer a side of fried rice? While the place has been recently updated and is very nice, there is no ambience. Service is so so."}
{"text":"A month ago I probably would have given this place 4 or 5 stars. We tended to come here almost weekly, most of the wait staff knew us and our usual orders. However as others have said the menu has completely changed and it is very likely going to drive away most of their old customer base who visited the restaurant for sushi.  As of February 19th Red is now a Vietnamese restaurant, and while there is nothing wrong with that, we enjoy Vietnamese food, it's not why we went to Red. There are very few sushi rolls left (very standard ones you can find anywhere), majority of the appetizers and main dishes have changed - definitely not a Japanese restaurant anymore. If you want Japanese food, you are going to have to go somewhere else now. The rolls I did have (Tootsie and Vegas), didn't taste much different, but I would need to try others to be certain on taste. Sadly I will not likely being trying other rolls because we will probably not be coming back once a week anymore. Truly unfortunate as it's hard enough to find decent sushi in Arizona."}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  I was quite impressed.  A bit of a drive since I live in Phoenix, but definitely work going to for occasions.  Went on an early Sunday evening and it was nice and quite.  Intimate little place."}
{"text":"This place was just alright. I've been wanting to go here for a while, but wasn't super impressed. It was supposedly happy hour, but there really wasn't anything that told you what the happy hour deals were. We found out when we got our check that it was like 25 cents to a dollar off different sushi rolls. So basically a pretty lame happy hour.   We didn't try the specialty rolls as those are not worth the money if there isn't a legit happy hour in my opinion, so the traditional rolls were pretty good. They were very basic so nothing special, but they were also very small. I was surprised with how little sushi came out. I tend to judge a place by how much wasabi they give, and they gave very little wasabi and didn't even provide ginger. The soy sauce was so salty I stopped using it. The miso soup was good, but they skimped on the tofu. So again, the food was good, but probably not worth my time and money to come back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Cool new Japanese / Sushi Place.  Power & Ray.  Some really cool unique rolls and tons of options for non-sushi eaters. I would say that the only issue they have, is that they do not have a Sushi ordering chart. You basically order the Sushi off the menu, so if you have a large group it may get confusing. I think they need to add a quick sushi ordering chart, so you can write down what you want. I think this will help the waiter or waitress as well."}
{"text":"Love the pho here. Went a last week and it hit the spot. Grabbed it to go so can't really comment on the service but the what I got was very  impressive."}
{"text":"wow, i wish i had tried this place sooner. loved it! the atmosphere was very clean and modern with an aquarium hosting an array of fish. there was not a hint of pretentiousness.   we went in early (4:30ish) so there was no wait and not many people in the restaurant. it started to pick up as we were leaving, but i definitely wonder how this place is doing. it just seems sort of hidden.  we ordered the alaska roll, red dragon roll and the princess roll. all of them were delicious! the princess roll was definitely the most visually appealing, but the alaska roll was my favorite. it was crab stick, avocado, and cucumber with salmon and lemon on top. all of the fish was extremely fresh and delicious.  the service was also excellent, and the place just had a relaxing vibe. i will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here for her first sushi experience. It was really clean and the service was as one would hope for. The sushi was fresh and full of flavor. My daughter loved it and asks all the time to go back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre which was overpriced. Had the worst service there. The restaurant was not crowded and it took them a good while to serve our food. In addition we had to ask our waitress several times for items we ordered. Don't mind me while I desperately try to get the last drop of water from my cup. No refills necessary  Would I ever return? Nope! Would I recommend this place to my family and friends? Nope! FYI Pho is not Japanese."}
{"text":"Now just called RED.  They dropped the word Koi from the name about a year ago.  Possibly a change of ownership.  I really liked that place when they had Katsu Curry.  It's a difficult dish to find here and one of my favorites.  They don't have the curry any more and I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but really wished the food was in larger portions. Was still hungry after I left even though I had the chicken teryaki bento box and side of salmon roll. Service was good, but the value could be much improved. Was wishing for some Hon-Machi sushi afterwards.."}
{"text":"Worth it. We are born and raised Californians looking for decent sushi. FOUND IT. Went for Father's Day and my hubby is super picky. Fresh tasting dishes, pho wasn't bad at all, and I got my hot sake. Can't go wrong. Plus, it was kid friendly regardless of our toddler being a total jerk at the table. The waitress and owner were super accommodating for the kids. It's difficult to find a place willing to accommodate the whole family the way they did. Go and try it out. Good food. Decent service. Prices match the quality."}
{"text":"Red is a great place for sushi!  They have some great proprietary rolls. The red roll is great! Their happy hour is affordable and a large variety to choose from. Honestly some of the best sushi I've had in AZ.   They do take out and their dining room has a great feel, nice sound level and there are always people in the dining area. Gets busy on weekends. Worth it.   Clean, friendly, good food!"}
{"text":"A sad excuse for a sushi restaurant. The rolls are flavorless and uninteresting, the fish quality is so low that every roll is smothered in mayonnaise and eel sauce. You have to ask for wasabi and ginger. When you're lucky enough to receive it you get enough for one piece of Nigiri and you'll need to use it all because it's the most bland, grainy green garbage I've ever seen. Paired up with 2 slivers of old, dry, warm ginger it really completes the meal of rotten fish dipped in mayo next to a dollup of green toothpaste.  The menu, much like the fish, hasn't changed since they opened up years ago.   The service is horrendous, especially the old, rude individual that stands behind the sushi bar. In good conscience I'm not able to refer to him as a sushi chef... That title would infer that he is actually a chef but in reality just a short, angry little turd dipping rotten tilapia in miracle whip.  If you are looking for a quality sushi restaurant go to Ryu sushi on Val Vista and William's Field.   If you are looking for a waste of money, a horrible experience, a bad taste in your mouth and chronic diarrhea then Red is the place for you."}
{"text":"They have a very good place but the sushi is not prepared the best. It's still very good but needs improvement. The staff are very friendly and accommodating also very cute. Not my number one pick from the bunch but worth the occasional visit. Love their sake and beer as well."}
{"text":"Their food is really good with generous portions. They will make custom orders, ask for ours, it's called the Weird Roll (#41).  You can't beat the friendly service either."}
{"text":"Finally came back to Red Koi since the sushi only switch to adding Vietnamese; I have been nervous the food would have suffered. All the same, still great quality ingredients. Our server was a bit scatterbrained and forgot to check on us server all times but was nice enough to make up for that...we are all human. The pho5 combo was excellent, only the tripe is cut so small it's hard to notice it being their. Sushi menu is overpriced. Nigiri is $6 for two slices, which I should add are delicious and expertly prepared, but at that cost could certainly manage to be bigger portions; the cuts were no bigger than your common revolving sushi bar. They added a thin sliver of lemon to the salmon that went a long way. We will be back, but hopefully by then they will have gotten larger tables more suited for the expanse of serving wear you will receive."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday afternoon, BEFORE the dinner rush. Got our from orders in almost immediately, and food order as well... But that's were things started to go south. Service became sporadic, and towards the end of our meal, after requesting the bill, we waited for about 20 minutes! Finally got the bill, put down the card on the bill plate and waited for 30 minutes or so before our waiter walked by... When he did we had to actually yell out to him to take our check, because he was about to blow right past us!  All in all the service here is iffy, but that being said, we thought the food was fantastic! I had Pho and Triple Threat roll, my wife had a couple roles of her choosing and they were all great.  If you want food food and don't care about crappy service then come here! If you're in a hurry, don't bother..."}
{"text":"My son and I love this place!  The sushi is priced great is really good. Nice atmosphere and always attentive service."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner and was sat after only a two or three minute wait. Then we just sat at the table while nobody noticed us whatsoever. I ended up leaving because no one would even acknowledge our existence. I called them up to let them know that I had left and that no one had even asked us what we wanted to drink and the man who answered the phone just said, \"ok.\" No apology, nothing at all. Their prices did were not great either. Needless to say I will not be back because I don't care for being ignored."}
{"text":"Great place for Sushi and steak teriyaki.  My husband and I went there for the first time and I ordered be California crunch roll as well as the volcano roll. My husband ordered the Teriyaki steak rice and salad. It was really good and we received great customer service and we are definitely coming back time every time we crave Sushi."}
{"text":"This place used to have better service.  I still do love the food and like that it is local and don't have to go to a big place to get sushi.  One time I ordered one sushi roll to go and waited 40 minutes while I sat.  I think they need more staff on busy days"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I have a picky seven-year-old and I lucked out in finding this place: they serve fries.  This is usually not the metric I use for guiding me to sushi restaurants, but then again, I normally don't bring my kid.  He enjoyed the kids dinner (terikayi chicken, fries, and weiners). My Mom tried a steak stir fry and said it was good.  I tried a couple of special rolls, which I thought we just OK, a spicy tuna hand roll, and an order of smelt roe nigiri. The hand roll was great.  I've had spicy tuna that was anything but spicy, and this was right on the mark in terms of piquancy.  Smelt roe was fine; no surprises.  It was totally worth ordering for the look on my son's face when I told him those were fish eggs and then proceeded to eat it.  The service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a bit annoyed because, for the most part, I like the food at this place. However, they are getting 2 stars because I just called to do a take-out order and was told \"we are too busy to do takeout right now\"...WTF??  Granted it is Friday night at 8 PM, but I could have been told my take-out would take 1 or 1 1/2 hours and I would have been cool with it...  Look, the place does not have very much seating. Besides: I don't feel like going out tonight...why can't I have my take-out???"}
{"text":"I have lived here for 2 years now and the \"hunt\" for good sushi and a clean and friendly environment have been a tough search........ My daughter and I came across Red Koi by accident ( alittle hidden and hard to see from the road)  But with that said,  we now eat there atleast once a week....... Its cute, charming, staff is friendly and helpful and the food is great!!! If you live in or near the area you should definitely try it out :)"}
{"text":"Great Sushi!  Not too many places to choose from in the SE valley -- but Red Koi had a great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Placed an order for pick up which included 5 sushi rolls and even asked for extra wasabi and soy sauce as well as two dishes. Here we are 76 dollars later, which by the way, looked at the menu online and came to find out half the items online they don't make anymore and the prices aren't even close...so we get home and see ONE CONTAINER OF SOY SAUCE for 5 rolls, seriously? We called up to the restaurant to complain and the lady that answered the phone hung up on us when we said would you eat 5 rolls with only one container of soy sauce. We immediately called back and they would not answer the phone. Called a couple more times, left a message for a manager to call us and nothing. I have never seen customer service so poor in my life nor been hung up on! We will never be back to this restaurant and encourage people to stay far away!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Luckily, I arrived about 12:10 because they don't open until noon. It is a nice place. It is clean, has nice decor, cool aquariums. I got the lunch special Box Bento with teriyaki chicken. I like the salad and dressing albeit a little too salty. The California rolls were good and the soy sauce seemed to be of good quality. The chicken was moist and tender. The service was prompt (the place was empty). I will return."}
{"text":"First time at Red Viet Cuisine. Arrived at 4:15 for an early Friday dinner and there were two tables full.   The menu was quite varied because they recently changed the concept. They offered several noodle dishes, apps, some sushi, rice dishes and specialties.   I was greeted somewhat quickly and given a menu and water. I ordered the Gyoza and an ASU roll.  All told it came to $18.10 with the happy hour discount.   The Gyoza were deep fried rather than pan fried. I prefer the latter. They were also rather scant with filling.   The Roll was colorful but not firm, which suggested older fish. The salmon was firm but not the tuna. Major disappointment there.   Found out about happy hour after eating by overhearing the conversation at the next table. They had to ask about it and my server was somewhat hesitant to honor the discount.   Not sure if a return trip is warranted at this point."}
{"text":"My mother and i decided to check this place out. It's my first time here and everything is fantastic!! I ordered chicken katsu with curry sauce, combination Pho and volcano roll. In my opinion volcano roll is okay.... We love Pho and katsu curry so much. Both plates are taste and the soup is hot flavorful. They use a premium food such as jasmine rice that they serve with the dish. Service is friendly!! I will defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"Sweet and Sassy Shrimp is amazing. Cmon in for the specials you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We ordered a fried sushi roll that was called a \"pop,\" and it was served skewered.  The fish was fresh and the batter light, buttery, and delicious.  We also tried the tempura calamari, which was also lightly battered, crunchy, and made with fresh calamari.  The dipping sauce was like a spicy aioli.  Nice.  We finished our evening with a rice noodle dish with pork and shrimp.  The noodles were perfect, and the meat savory and tender.  I really liked the lemongrass sauce that came with the noodles dish.  It was a perfect light compliment to meat, veggies, and basil garnish.  The wait staff were very attentive.  We had a young lady named Darcie serve us, and she was watchful but not overbearing.  I noticed the other wait staff were friendly, and they checked in on us too.  We did not order drinks but instead opted for green tea, which was nutty and tasted fresh.  The menu was immense, and I think I will return to try more of it at another time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great sushi and great service! I have never been disappointed when coming here. The atmosphere is extremely relaxing!"}
{"text":"Super good. We just drove by looking for something to eat and saw it. We are glad we stopped. I had their Vegas roll and Miso soup. Soooo good!! My husband had the chicken karaage and chicken katsu. He loved both of them. It was his first time having the chicken karaage. He will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Great little find!     I'm new to the area and relied on Yelp to find me a spot for some good sushi.    Glad I trusted the reviews!    I'll be back for sure.   I had the Koi roll #22.      Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi in a clean atmosphere. I hope this place makes it because we need good sushi on the east side. Love their salad dressing too!"}
{"text":"We went here because a friend recommended it & we were completely satisfied! The staff were friendly, happy and efficient. We arrived for happy hour and as we were deciding on what to try we noticed the staff were cleaning all the chairs and tables thoroughly! The whole place is so clean and neat, which was a huge plus to my wife since she is OCD about cleanliness! We tried the Spring rolls, Tootsie roll, Triple Threat roll & Rainbow roll. Since my wife had never had true (raw) sushi she was nervous, but she did nothing but rave about how good it was! We also had an Obrien beer & an Ahasi(?) which was a nice change too. Great service and the food was even better!  It's a must!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was terrible. The guy that helped us seemed like he didn't know the menu or much about sushi in general.They didn't even provide ginger and when we asked for some they brought out a tiny bit. As we finished our plates they just continued to stack up, while the servers walked right."}
{"text":"If I had written this review when Red first opened they would have received 4 stars, but unfortunately prices went up and food quality went down. We have been fans of Red ever since they opened. We have a large family and frequently like to gather here for dinner. My favorite is the California Tempura Roll, even my kids love it, and my husband's favorite is the Las Vegas Roll. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but the floor is always sticky. The service has always been very slow, and I mean really slow. I have noticed that that is a frequent complaint. You also have to hunt someone down for refills on your drink. Ever since the new changes in prices and food quality, we haven't been in several months. Good place, but used to be better."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had the Crazy Shrimp roll, veggie & shrimp tempura appetizer, and a few other things. Took our mother-in-law (a sushi rookie) and she loved it too. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We've ordered the chicken pho from here a few times and every time we have been disappointed. Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area the amount of chicken and broth they give you is significantly smaller for your money. Even though this restaurant is closer to our house we will drive further for better food and pricing."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch. Sat at the sushi bar since it was just me but still had the server/host taking my order.  Service was slow, but friendly.    I had the Under the Sun Roll and a miso soup.  The miso was \"OK\" - a bit bland, but with enough soy and sriracha sauce it was good.  The roll was quite tasty and very fresh, although for $11 I thought it was a little steep.   Still on the search for a really good but cheap sushi place (kind of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place!), but this place will do for the time being."}
{"text":"I love it, the prices are reasonable. The food is delish. Nice portions, my favorite is the tempura. The drinks are great and it's a nice, darkly lit, no frill restaurant. This is one of our favorites"}
{"text":"We used to love this place... everything changed. Even the name. They no longer have the awesome Vento boxes, the service is mediocre, kids meals no longer exist. They had such a good thing originally."}
{"text":"Terrible and way over priced. I can't believe I was charged $7.50 for 2 chicken skewers. Never again!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner here.  The service and cleanliness was great.  The food was ok.  I ordered the following 1. miso soup. - good flavor 2. Jalapeño appetizer- surprisingly bland 3. Arizona Roll - pretty good 4. Spicy California Roll - average at best.   All in all - ok place to visit. I will continue to look for a better place."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight. There were not many people there and it did not appear busy. Service was poor we waited for 15 minutes with our menus and no one bothered to see if we were ready to order. There was a waitress standing around too. We left and took our business else where."}
{"text":"Garlic tuna roll and Vegas roll were amazing ! Place was clean. Wish there was outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This was some of the best sushi I've ever had, and the service was great. A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Our spicy tuna roll wasn't fresh   Told two servers about it and we still ended up paying for it.  The rest was mediocre at best.  I've had better sushi at other nearby places in the area."}
{"text":"Waited excitedly for Red to reopen after their remodel. Like some of the current reviewers, we were greatly disappointed. The sushi pretty much disappeared, what was left was not fresh or appetizing, the menu changed/shrunk and we were told the restaurant was now geared towards serving the growing local Vietnamese community. Had a couple sake bombs to sadly toast our last visit...now looking for a new sushi joint."}
{"text":"I am completely heartbroken in every way. RED is now under new management and what a huge mistake this was!! This place will never make it! The new management completely changed the menu to no longer be a sushi bar but a Vietnamese restaurant. They took the bar out and put up this huge wall so you can no longer see any of the kitchen at all. The staff can hardly speak or understand English. They got our order wrong twice. We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant where as when this was the real \"Red\" it would always be busy. The menu has completely changed, all Vietnamese food, only a tiny section of sushi and the food is NOT the same. Something as simple as \"RED's\" amazing house salad with mixed greens is now iceberg lettuce. The ingredients are cheap and the service was terrible. My husband and I would come her 4-5 times a month for years and I would tell EVERYONE about how amazing RED is. Now... I'll never be back.. . Jason... If you're out there and you're reading this and you've opened a new restaurant... PLEASE tell me where it is. I'm so sad I can't take it."}
{"text":"First visit here and I will definitely will go back. The dining room is decorated beautifully. Very clean and contemporary.  Ordered sushi rolls to go. Eel roll was delicious. Spicy tuna roll was a little bit bland. Saw a bowl of pho go out while I  was waiting for my order and it looked really tasty. Can't wait to try it next."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with family before dropping them off at airport; the service and food were really on point. Liked the happy hour menu because you could order small plates for $4.00 and get sushi which was in my opinion the best sushi I have had in a long time. I had The Garlic Tuna, which was great. All the rolls we ordered were really good.  The rolls were between 10 and 15 dollars. The fish was very fresh and big rolls so we were not disappointed ! This restaurant Left a good impression, the place was clean, our food came out fast, and the \"house \" salad was awesome! I should have taken pictures :(  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese food. The garlic steak was great. The Mi Kho was awesome. Perfectly slice pork and shrimp on noodles with fresh bean sprouts. The springs rolls were really good too. Full of pork, no skimping here with a sweet dipping sauce. My husband got a rainbow roll, it was good but a bit smaller than we're used to, but still tasty. All in all a good meal!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in years. Awesome fresh Wasabi. Amazing squid! Try the princess roll, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The garlic tuna and Alaska roll are our family favorites.  We have been coming here for years.  Easy to get a table 99% of the time.  Frequently small mistakes in service occur but are minor (such as delayed drinks or waiting a little long on the bill).  We canNOT find better sushi anywhere around the area.  It is so good!  We stop in several times a month.  It is worth a little extra patience with the servers. I debated about giving it five stars but the sushi itself is five star worthy everytime!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant to not only awkward silence but unsure whether we sat ourselves or someone sat us. A lady then appears and proceeds to seat us, without asking number of people for the evening and hands us a book. Asking for an ice tea was a struggle, so dare I ask for an alcohol beverage. Knowing I  was on a time crunch we decided to ask the server to assist us in what we were looking to irder. Never will make that mistake as they don't serve any stir fry veggies? I ordered sashimi and the yellowtail... Was needless to say very sad. I would think when a menu size such as this place, the server would be more knowledgeable and able,to understand our request. Would I eat here again? Negative."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best sushi place within 10 miles of my house. I have eaten at least 10 different rolls here and this is our go-to place for sushi after going to Tamari for years. The $Money$ roll is our favorite. My wife grew up eating sushi in the Bay Area and she loves this place. I have many friends that also call this their favorite sushi place in the Gilbert area. I can't say much for the other items on the menu, but the sushi is awesome. The seaweed salad is also pretty tasty. I have never had a friend of mine complain when I send them to Red."}
{"text":"I am from Japan, and know Japense food.  Red Koi is a typical non-Japanese owned pseudo Japanese restaurant.   I went there once for dinner, and it'll be my first & last time to go there.   Food tasted just like food court pseudo Japanese food with much higher price tag."}
{"text":"Been there 2 times this month and the Bun is very skimpy.  Mine had 5 pieces of lettuce and the sauce to dump over was not enough to wet the dish.  Always order the summer rolls, the peanut sauce isn't enough to use with 2 rolls, we ordered extra and they charged is $1.  We also ordered 2 summer roll orders and one had shrimp the other just pork.  This food is cheep to make so I'm thinking they need to bulk up the lettuce dishes and make it a true meal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. My boyfriend and I seated ourselves and two waiters came to take our drink order. When we began to order out appetizer, the waiter walked away. No one payed attention to us for the most part, despite the fact that it wasn't busy, and we had different waiters and waitresses the entire time. The sushi was good but the yakisoba lacked any taste. Spices don't mesh well with my stomach, so it was either make it bland, or end up throwing up later on. This place needs to step up their service and their food. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and we were the only people in the entire place. It still took about 15 minutes for someone to come to our table and when they did, they didn't ask for our drink order.   Once we ordered our foods and drinks we waited about 40 minutes (only people still in the restaurant) for our food to come out. We were starving so decided to order another roll. They forgot to put it in so it was about another 35 minute wait. We decided to take it to go.   Getting the bill was a whole different story. The guy couldn't remember where he put the order and charged us for three more expensive rolls then the ones we purchase. I get if he was maybe training but someone should have been with him then or maybe it was an \"off day\" either way, the whole thing was a mess and very unorganized.   I'm only giving it two stars because we ordered out one time and the order was ready when we arrived (15 mins) but even that is way more expensive then what you are getting. I got one roll and one traditional roll for $28 dollars. Crazy because it was poorly made and not fresh tasting. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been following Red Koi since the sign went up before they opened, and I waited to write a review until I could give them four stars. They have definitely improved over time. This is Izakaya-style pub food, not Japanese fine dining, and they do a good job of it.  Our most recent meal was the best yet. We had five dishes plus sake during happy hour, thoroughly enjoyed all of it, and the check was just $31. For $2, the tempura onions are a delicious no-brainer addition to any meal. The chicken katsu is excellent (though the pork katsu, when I've had it, has been tough). The sushi is great and beautifully presented, though anything dipped in soy and wasabi tastes good to me (having taught English in Japan for a year, I enjoy sushi, but am no connoisseur). At a previous meal, my wife ordered fried rice but wanted the meat replaced with vegetables. The chef added small brown mushrooms that looked gorgeous and added a wonderful earthy note to the rice.   I have one big gripe with Red Koi. They serve pho. Not ramen, pho. I love pho, but there are dozens of Vietnamese pho joints along the Dobson Asian corridor that make it much, much better than Red Koi ever will. Why, Red Koi, why? Do you want to make good Japanese food, or sink into pan-Asian mediocrity?"}
{"text":"Soft-shell crab very good but a little salty. Grilled Yellowtail Kama excellent!  Not sure if I believe some of the bad reviews. Maybe they have gotten better or maybe we are just here on a really good day."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some co workers,  I love sushi and have heard good things about this place. The sushi was wonderful, and my coworkers really liked the pho. I'd come back for the food, but not the service. The service was awful. The guy who took our order had to come back to make sure he had the drink order right, forgot some sides that we had ordered, and never refilled our drinks, or even asked if we wanted refills for that matter. There was no ginger or wasabi with the sushi orders, so my coworker and I asked for some. We were never brought any. We had to flag our waiter down to get the check, and then he took ten minutes to bring it to us (There were maybe 3 other groups of 3 or less people in the restaurant and there was another waiter working). Once we got the checks he was quick about running them, which was nice. When we left we noticed that there was wasabi on some of the tables of the people who were eating sushi, so obviously they had it available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My favorite sushi joint in town. We moved pretty far away recently and still drive across town to come here. In addition to the outstanding food ...the service here is consistently awesome."}
{"text":"For starters this place does not map properly on google or anything else even though the address is correct. Its actually located off the 202 San Tan at Power and Ray Rd on the East side of the rd from Wal Mart. The atmosphere was very nice. I really liked the tables and dishes. The miso soup was very good and cheap as well. The prices on everything were very reasonable. There are several sushi restaurants along power and I definitely believe that this was one of the better ones (unfortunately thats not saying too much). The rolls were pretty good. A bite or 2 of the uni on the Jade roll tasted a bit suspect but overall the jade roll was good. The avocado and creme cheese gave it a smooth texture.  The super albacore roll was nicely seared on the outside. The tiger roll was a bit spicy for my weak taste buds but had good flavor."}
{"text":"Been coming here b4 they renovated, so went there for early dinner ordered Papaya salad extra spicy) its d worst papaya salad that i ever had.   We came today n literally dont want us to serve bcuz of wat happen b4. Lols . Seriously they don't want your opinion about their food, they should make their papaya salad better not like kicking us out. Whoever d owner this establishment surely don't know how to fix their problems. Adios!! Hopefully u guys will last...  Go to Sushi San , just search on YELP!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty good! Off the corner on Ray and Power Rd, it's a decent sized restaurant hidden slightly in the back of a plaza. When I walked in, I was greeted to modern styled Japanese decor which was very nice and worked well with the environment it was in. My friend and I were quickly seated and got cracking on the menu. They had a typical Japanese-American menu with a few staples such as miso soup and veggie and shrimp tempura. After looking around the menu for a while, I decided to get the veggie and shrimp tempura and the Fire and Ice roll. The veggie and shrimp tempura were cooked well, just the right amount of batter and cooked to the right time to have the nice crunch on the outside, yet the softness of the veggies and shrimp on the inside of it's panko/batter crust. The Fire and Ice roll was pretty good, the only thing that I had a slight issue was that the roll was fried for a bit too long. The batter on the ends of it felt a bit too thick for the roll, but other than that the roll was great! The flavors worked well and the presentation was well executed. It's a little expensive at about $9-10 dollars a roll, but I for sure will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pho closest to me...and delicious! Sushi and Curry too! I love this place, been here a half a dozen times and never disappoints. Price is right, service is great and you can definitely find plenty of seating since they renovated. Lunch time is the best. It can be relatively slow compared to the bustle at dinner time. Great atmosphere too. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place never fails. They are always so nice & the food is always excellent. We try to get something new every time we come & it's our new favorite every single time. I highly recommend 100 percent!"}
{"text":"Good pho but not the best pho I've ever had. It satisfies the craving and is near where I live so I tend to frequent this place based on the convenient location. I just get pho every time, never tried the sushi. I want to sometime though! The spring rolls and the potstickers are yummy!"}
{"text":"Again another yummy sushi time. The Super Duper Baked Roll, wow it's huge and delicious. Only order if you are hungry or sharing. Some new wait staff on board, runs even better."}
{"text":"I never really had great service. The waiters were probably family and was never trained how to smile and interact with customers. But I came here once a week JUST FOR THE SUSHI. It was so amazing. Come to find out that they don't serve sushi anymore and turned into another joe pho place. I walked out and I'm not coming back unless they bring back the sushi menu..   Two stars for su-shi. Otherwise, eh."}
{"text":"The sushi here is wonderful. The service is top-notch and the portions are very generous.  Their menu offers a wide variety of rolls and traditional sushi and sashimi favorites. What makes Red so special is that it's not your run-of-the-mill sushi chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Just recently moved from California, been searching for a good pho joint to cure some homesickness. This place is it for sure"}
{"text":"Oh, Red Koi...Why must you disappoint me and prove all your other critics right?   My last experience sounds more like everybody else's. We ordered the poke and tako salad appetizers. They were delightfully served in martini glasses, but that was the only good thing about them. The poke was WAY to salty, and the tako portion was very small.   I ordered the sashimi dinner, but unfortunately the waitress heard me wrong and brought me the sushi dinner. I was excited for thick slices of fish, but instead got thinner slices on top of rice. I had already waited considerably longer than the rest of the party for my food, so I just decided to eat it. It wasn't worth the wait, as the fish quality was mediocre at best.   I will probably go again, but it better be more like my first experience next time. My friend says it's hit or miss. I don't want anymore misses."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, but the sushi rolls don't come with any ginger?   Customer service was complete joke. The waiter acted as if I was a pain in the ass, and I was the only one in the restaurant.   Save your time and money for somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our experience at this restaurant.  A very large menu with many choices, high quality food at a reasonable price.  We have pretty sophisticated palates and were impressed.   I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing menu selection of sushi plates and entrees for those who aren't keen on seafood. I am a sushi addict and I fell in love with this place as did my boyfriend, who isn't a sushi eater (he had the Chicken Katsu)!   Great atmosphere and ambiance. The staff are very friendly.   We ate here on a Saturday which is all day happy hour. The prices are great and the servings sizes are normal. (Unlike other sushi places who make smaller portions during the happy hour.)   The only thing was the service was a little slow but we were there to enjoy our night so we didn't mind. Great place to dine!  All the dishes we had we're amazing!!  Appetizers: Sweet Fried Onion  Entree: Chicken Katsu with Rice  Sushi Rolls: Las Vegas Roll  Tootsie Roll"}
{"text":"Red my favorite color.  Red Koi, not my favorite restaurant, but I'll give it more of a try. Let's be honest, I'm not one to venture out into Gilbert in the far edges of Phoenix where the horse lords of Rohan roam. Every now and then I'll be out there. I visited Red Koi with my family and order the Soba Noodles with Chicken. It was a tad bit on the saucy side and too salty for me.  I gather it was because of the sauce.  My family likes their Chicken Pho there so definitely next time I'll try it out.  Ambience is cool. I really enjoy the fish tanks on both sides when you walk in.  Service was okay, but it seemed pretty busy when we came so I'm not going to complain about my water.  I generally need it filled 3-4 times. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"No big surprise here. New ownership taking over and changing menu. NO MORE SUSHI!! There goes my business!  Love love love this place. Absolutely love their sushi. The prices are great. Sushi is fresh. Something has happened recently with the service. I can note that at least three super friendly and super efficient servers are no longer here, within the last few months on lunch service. Only one server working today. Waited and waited. Then I was told they'd be with me shortly . As I'm writing this three gentleman just walked out that didn't wait half as long as I did to place my order. Once I ordered, rec'd my meal within eight minutes l. Which is very acceptable. I hope it's a fluke the service has been a bit off recently , because I'm on quite limited time on my lunch hour. I'll give it another shot. Fingers crossed. Rating"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi place!!! There isn't anything that isn't good! Me and my bf love coming here! A little pricey but the portions are pretty decent! Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a joke, service is horrible and customer service is interesting. Don't come here! They have such low quality sushi on top of having horrible service. I still paid $25 during happy hour! The pot stickers are smaller than your baby toe, thinner than a pencil and they burned them. I will not be going back a better alternative is sea star sushi off of chandler heights and power, which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Frequented this restaurant for lunch about 2 x a week, where I enjoyed their Pho soup. I went today and was charged$11.83!!!! It used to be about $8.00.....I REFUSE TO PAY ALMOST 12.00 for a bowl of soup!!! They just lost a good customer."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time. The atmosphere was fresh, clean and modern. Great service. They didn't mind bringing us cucumber for our teething baby:) green tea was good considering it was a bag. Prices were average for sushi.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time the other night with my wife. It was happy hour so we stuck to the rolls on special. To our delight everything was great. The tootsie roll was our favorite but we also liked the calamari roll and the spicy tuna.  The only knock was the seaweed was way too chewy had it been better I would give it 4 stars. We will eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discover this little gem a few years ago, we made it our regular date night spot, but the service has gone way down, the food is still good and the prices are decent. The last time we went I mentioned to the girl at the front counter how disappointed we have been with one server in particular and she did apologize but also stated that many people complain about how rude he is to customers, yet he is still employed there. Explain that one?"}
{"text":"This restaurant closed for a few days in Feb. 2016 for a remodel. They should close it again & put it back. The majority of the sushi is now gone & what's left isn't worth the cost.   The service has always been fairly mediocre, but for good food, we would always take our patience with us.   Bad food & bad service make this once regular joint for us a no go now."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. I love the sushi, servers have always been kind, and love the music. The won ton soup tastes great! The green tea mochi hits the spot every time, and they're not cheat on the Thai Tea."}
{"text":"I think I'm glad that I didn't try Red Koi when it first opened.  They've had some time to work the kinks out.  We've been here at least five times and have had consistently great food and service.  Their entrees are fabulous (love the Bento box for lunch - $7).  My husband tried the noodle soup and he thought it was great.  Their chicken katsu is made the right way (thin chicken breast, panko breadcrumbs, crispy).  We've tried sushi and many of the entrees...EVERYTHING was good.  It's so great to have this little gem so close to home.  The kids even love it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and after they've remodeled / changed concepts and it is a decent place to grab sushi. Definitely not the freshest I've had, but pretty decent for the price. Only downfall is that since remodeled they've removed the sushi bar, which does make it a little awkward and less like a sushi place. Haven't tried any of their Vietnamese dishes yet, but will probably give them a try. Huge menu with tons of options. Worth checking out and making you own opinion."}
{"text":"Bland food, and tempura batter seemed to have something in it, like pieces of brush hairs. Rice seemed stale, waiter seemed bothered by us and there was only 1 other person in there."}
{"text":"What  was I thinking when I ordered Pho at this place? sucked sooooo bad!!!! I was totally craving a rich broth and noodles on a cold day and out came this flavorless bowl of soup and noodles. Since I had two not so good experiences with this place I won't return."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and rolls were pretty good but service was terrible. Had to ask for water twice. Had to hunt down a server to get our check."}
{"text":"Sushi and Vietnamese food?! It's like my foodie dream come true!!!  We went tonight for dinner. Probably the first meal I've had and didn't take one pic! Epic fail on my part.  They were pretty busy so that was a good sign.  We started with summer rolls and chicken wings. The summer rolls were pretty tasty and love the dipping sauce. Chicken wings were lacking flavor. It comes with the sweet chili sauce. But I feel it needed some seasoning on the chicken itself. They were big pieces of chicken though.  Meal wise. I ordered the pho tai extra beef and a sushi roll. Husband ordered the sticky noodles and a shrimp tempura roll.  The soup broth was ok. Lots of beef. But it was thick sliced and chewy. But $9 for soup? And $4 for extra beef is steep.  Sushi was just okay. Not enough fish for the price we paid.  Our waitress clearly did not want to be there. She would literally dump our food on our table and run off. She didn't smile once. And just seemed very rude.  So overall. I would say they have the viet cuisine down. Sushi is slacking. Could be better.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. But it's only a few mins from my house."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that Red Koi no longer existed. I knew when I ordered something was different. Portion size is TINY for the same price. Being from San Jose, I know good Vietnamese food when I taste it and the vermicelli was a joke. More like dry noodles w a small tablespoon of fish sauce in a shot glass. I had to ask for more and I got the same small cup that was practically empty.  Obviously there is no customer service here. The pho was salty, and now the portion size of everything is micro. Once a regular customer and now I'm never coming back. Found a new sushi restaurant for a replacement. Now I just need a local Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"Ordered saki bombs, wine, and sushi on the happy hour menu.  Four adults and drink's around $90 with tip. Very good value!"}
{"text":"Pho was very tasty though skimped a bit on the beef. Tootsie roll right texture and taste. Finally a place in east Gilbert for pho!"}
{"text":"Staying near Mesa airport and this hit the spot.  Good food - very tasty.  Seems like they are trying hard on the presentation, which was not a bad thing.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Does one really think about sushi at 1100 a.m.? Well, that's when they open and that's when we popped in. So I don't think they were expecting a party of 10 that early, but they stepped up regardless! Kudos for that! And kudos to the young gal working our party, she did a bang-up job!   This place has a nice vibe! Great décor, very clean and seemingly appropriate for their food genre. The sushi itself, spot on! Now for full disclosure, though I love sushi, I don't eat it enough to know the going prices. So six bucks per sushi selection (two pieces of sushi) seemed a bit steep to me. So needless to say/write, I didn't walk away full, but I did walk away satisfied, if that makes any sense.  I'd return, though, that's for certain! And if you have not tried them, you should!"}
{"text":"Red Koi is now under new ownership and has completely changed, not for the better. They went from being our favorite new sushi place to being a place we won't be coming back to. Their happy hour has completely dwindled down to almost nothing, they have a very limited basic list of rolls, that you can get at almost every other sushi restaurant, and the taste and quality seem to have changed as well. We asked if they would do any of the sushi rolls from their previous menu and they said no. Another odd thing was when we walked in, my husband and I went to a large 6 seat table, we were waiting on 3 others, the guy told us sorry, these are for celebrations, ummm what? It's very sad and a complete bummer, we were coming here once a week for awhile and now we won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have never had Pho and decided to try this place. We don't have anything else to compare it to since it was our first time but we both thought our food was delicious. We both got the pho beef? The service was good, we were actually the only ones there. Definitely recommend this place if you want to get some good Vietnamese."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been enjoying sushi from this business for years, since it was Red Koi. So today my wife wanted some sushi for an early Mother's Day dinner. During the placement of soups for my family (wife, daughter and son) the waiter dropped one of the miso soups all over the table, which fell all over my son's lap (6 yr old) and all over my phone and sunglasses. He apologized and a waitress took over serving us for the rest of the night. Not expecting but as a courtesy of spilling soup on my son and phone, we didn't get compensated for a single dish. There didn't appear to be a manager on shift just late teenagers or early twenties employees with no customer service expectations towards the people who pay their salary. This is our last time at this business, best of luck."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to Red Koi when get great service and even better tasting food. Red Koi has become our new favorite sushi spot they have a large variety and many different options to choose from."}
{"text":"Really great food (high quality, clean, incredible flavor) service, atmosphere and music. Finally found our official Sushi/Pho Soup spot near home. Their story of how they became makes them even better! Very impressed!! 5 STARS"}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Prices are typical for sushi. No idea why you have to ask for wasabi and ginger.   No idea why one of my rolls was on a plate with someone else's rolls when it arrived. Then 5 min later my 2nd roll arrived.   Im searching for a better sushi spot. But in a pinch this place ain't bad."}
{"text":"Just as a per-cursor I've only been to this restaurant for lunch and it's never been crowded when I go so service so for me has always been awesome!  This is the spot! I have been to Sushi restaurants all over the valley a lot of times you will hear a review that says \"It's nice to get a decent restaurant in Gilbert\", but this is the spot regardless of where you're at in the valley. It's very clean and modern with red and black theme that is just awesome. It's at least as good if not better than restaurants I've been too including downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale.   Their lunch specials are amazing all priced under $8 and includes things from Pho to a pork katsu bento to calamari tempura sushi rolls. I've tried almost everything on their lunch menu and have never been disappointed. This place is almost never busy for lunch so if you're in the area don't forget to stop in because I'd hate to loose this restaurant as my families go to place for lunch. Right now road construction makes people reluctant to patronize businesses along Power but fortunately Red Koi is located at a light so even making left hand turns into it or out of it makes it easy so don't let the construction deter you from stopping in!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now.  Both times food was very good but service lacked a little.  Very young staff and not knowledgable of the menu or timing.  It's a good place to go if you are with people who aren't huge sushi fans."}
{"text":"We came to eat for an early dinner on a Wednesday night so the place was empty when we walked in, which meant fast service.  It was clean and had good ambiance.  We ordered chicken skewers as an appetizer and they were well-seasoned but rubbery.  For $7.50 for 2 small skewers I would expect them to be cooked to perfection.  We did get $1 off for happy hour.  My wife ordered the seafood and fat noodles and said the calamari was chewy and the best part of her dish was the onions.  I ordered the crunchy noodles with chicken and shrimp.  It was okay, not great, but the noodles were crunchy and delicious with the sauce they put under them.  I might come back to try the Pho, but otherwise it was a bit overpriced for the quality.  Not horrible, but certainly not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly service (although a bit slow at times). Unfortunately our biggest reason for giving red koi 3 stars is the food. The sushi was ok at best and the beef teriyaki was rubbery and flavorless. We wanted to like this place but unfortunately we wont be back."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a Vietnamese/Japanese cuisine restaurant.  We, 2 adults 2 children, came here at around 3:30 today and we were the only ones in places at the time.  Since this is the first time for us we took a little bit of time looking over the menu.  My wife ordered Bun Bo Hue which tasted nothing like the authentic version...broth was watered down not worth $11.75 price at all.  I ordered Red koi roll, surf and turf roll and spice albacore roll.  We waited more than 30 minutes to get our food from time of order.  Waitress waited 15 minutes gone by to let us know spicy albacore was not available.  When we finally got our food they were brought out one dish at a time with what felt like an eternity in between.  It was incredibly frustrating to have waited so long when there were literally only us and one other party of 2 in the entire place. On top of that none of the food was good or worth the money AT ALL!!!  The made no efforts in presenting the foods, which in sushi dining is often regarded as important as the food itself.  No ginger slices offered with sushi rolls and we had one dap of wasabi the size of a nickel to eat with 3 rolls of sushi.  What they served is neither Vietnamese nor Japanese cuisine , but rather the food is hodgepodge together and call it done.  If you want to experience what Vietnamese or Japanese cuisine please go elsewhere.  If I could I would give this place a negative star .  Be warned."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a Saturday. The food is really good. The best summer rolls I've ever had, very unique. I had the dry rice noodles as well and that was delicious.  My wife and kid liked their food as well. The downside is the price. Everything is significantly more expensive than similar restaurants.  Like 2 to 3 bucks per item. Also, there was only one server for the whole place so service stunk. She took our order reasonably fast and the food came out quickly but she never checked on us. I was only able to order one beer! The horror! I was tempted to give 3 stars for the service but the food is just so good."}
{"text":"First time here and it was super clean and super fresh.  Ordered Pho and it was on point! Will be making more visits for sure."}
