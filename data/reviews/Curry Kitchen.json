{"text":"The food and service here was pretty good. The ambiance in the restaurant is nothing to write home about - but the eats are inexpensive, the food is hot, and it tastes good. Also, the people working we're very friendly and helpful.  I came here for an unorthodox Christmas dinner with my parents, after checking them into the Hilton Garden Inn, during the week-long 2013 Toronto power winter blackout. I'm really happy that they're open, and have tasty food here. We decided on this place because they offered a few more vegetarian options relative to the other restaurants that were open this turkey-stuffed Christmas evening.  Members of my dining party greatly appreciate food with low sodium, low oil/grease, and minimally spicy. This place is fairly good in those respects; for some dishes you can request a less spicy meal (not sure about sodium/oil requests). I had the Chicken Biryani and parents ordered a couple of Veggie Curry dishes. For the price the volume of food and taste is pretty good.  Compared to most of the Indian restaurants I've been to, I'd say this place is a good for the price, volume of food, and taste although a reduction in the the salt and oil/grease would be nice. Also, don't be thrown off by their use of take out containers. They seem to be used interchangeably as dine-in/takeout food receptacles regardless of where you're eating."}
{"text":"first time visit.  my food was placed inside a styrofoam container and heated up in the microwave.  big no no.  second chance visit. chicken was COLD  third time visit.  there won't be one.  avoid."}
{"text":"We stopped here late last night. It was really cheap, especially with a student discount but I wasn't impressed when the guy there slopped my food in styrofoam and tossed it in the microwave. Also, my chai tea had lumps and crap in it. The samosas weren't too bad just really oily like everything else. We will never go here again."}
{"text":"It certainly doesn't look like much but this \"hole in the wall\" really serves up great home-cooked style Indian food. Food is not too greasy and not the typical North Indian style food. Their vegetarian dishes are fantastic as are the biryanis and curries. Prices are very affordable too."}
{"text":"OMG whatta hidden treasure in downtown core! So underappreciated!  We have been there munching our vegetarian dishes for five and counting times. Food has always been so wonderful - tasty, warm, fresh, as the name says: home cooked. Yeah, sometimes the guy has been to back to warm up food, but I can recall this only once, really. We usually have veggie curry, dahl (both come with romaine salad) and samosas. Food is a bit spicy, but not too spicy, as even I could handle it with a mild tolerance as mine. Very enjoyable altogether.  Staff is wonderful, two Indian brothers, very attentive and fast, they listen you out and yeah, for students as us we got off from already cheap price. Place is suitable for just sitting down for a moment for a quick but large portion meal. Necessary to add but the one styrofoam box is enough food for two women. During the lunch and evening there will be seats available.  Price range is cheap, as you can get a healthy meal in $5.  For somebody who is looking an experience of a new cuisine and is into CHEAP and GOOD Indian food, this place is heaven."}
{"text":"This place has been my staple diet for the last year. Its menu is ridiculously cheap, it's gravies are full of flavour, the people behind the counter are nice and friendly and to top it, I get a student discount at the place. Also the portions are large. I always get the chicken biriyani and they put some of the best gravies on top of it if you request them to."}
{"text":"just order the butter chicken (which is very good). Have eaten 30 meals there and all their other meats are not good. The goat is all bone and the other chicken is just gross pieces of the bird. but like I said, butter chicken is really good and cheap"}
{"text":"Can I please come here everyday and pay more? Amazingly spicy biryani with 2 chicken drumsticks and butter chicken sauce for only 5 dollars flat. No frills, just great value. Bright and airy in a nondescript location. Seated and eating in less than 2 minutes. Can't wait till next time"}
{"text":"Honestly, a large box of chicken biryani for $5 flat is the best deal you're going to find in downtown Toronto. It's really filling, you get a decent amount of chicken, a curry to add more flavor on top, and just lots of rice that balances it all out and makes your soul really happy. I'm a big fan of biryani and although this may not be the best in the world and the spicy option is still not really spicy- it's the best option for the price you're paying. Perfect for hungry students like me. And service is always fast and straightforward, just gets a bit busy during lunch but the wait is still never longer than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Amazing biriyani, don't miss the lamb biriyani on Tuesdays and Fridays. Worth the money you spend. Chicken biriyani and chicken curry is also good. The guys are cool and I have been eating here for a long time, never had any bad experiences. Go for it, easily the best biriyani you can find downtown. Bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Deadly cheap, but holy sodium.  In this entire forsaken area, it is terrifically hard to find decent vegetarian offerings for under $5 - or, dare I say it, under $4. For ameliorating that condition with its $4 spinach or dahl + rice combos, Curry Kitchen gets 3 stars; they also have daily specials that knock additional loonies off the already impressive prices (for example, on Mondays the $6 veg curry + rice + caesar salad + 2 samosas combo is just $5). They also have a student discount, which I think is just \"tax exemption\".  The naan bread is delicious and fresh (tip: you can ask to substitute naan for rice), in contrast to all their other lukewarm-out-the-microwave food. Although the veg curry was pretty good, the spinach was the saltiest thing I've had since the last time my doctor told me to gargle with salt water. Hopefully it's just a one-time thing; the food was otherwise not bad, considering prices.  I will probably be back. It's cheap, close, and veg-friendly, plus the naan is noms."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken biryani today and paid $5 flat, no tax, and was pleasantly surprised with the quantity and quality. Felt the dish was made in a very homely style. Perfect amount of spices for a medium spice tasting. It definitely is dollar worth the value."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. Got the curry beef special. It was $7.00 for an order of beef, rice and and some salad. Very Very inexpensive and not bad... Decore is pretty minimal and the owners seemed happy to see me. He asked if I was a student, told him \"I just looked young\", very flattering"}
{"text":"They make a fantastic chicken biryani. Very flavourful, and significant quantity. Then there is the price... $5 for a meal that size and that good is quite the steal.   The place is very bare bones though, and I would not recommend eating in; they microwave the food in styrofoam containers. Recommend doing take away, and enjoying their great biryani at home."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best deals around Dundas Square. Chicken Biryani is above average but hella cheap for a HUGE portion. Deals every day."}
{"text":"Located near Ryerson, this is a hole in the wall establishment catering to anyone who loves cheap curry or Biriani, and fast. Usually the student population loves this place. Not particularly healthy as it's a lot of starch and carbs but no one can really argue with a $4.99 lunch of rice, potatoes and meat. Tastes good enough for me, and I'm not picky when I'm hungry or looking for cheap eats. If you're a RU student, this is a good go-to."}
{"text":"First off, this place looks very sketchy with its boarded up walls but beside this boards is a tiny purple doorway. I ordered the chicken biryani (mild), which is the daily special but considering that it's every day's special it sort of defeats the of a daily special. It costs $5 exactly (no tax or tax included). I was surprised when the mild was truly mild. There was a hint of spice in the rice and chicken. Overall, I thought this was a great deal. A big box of flavourful rice with a 2 chicken pieces. The rice had nice flavour but less that what I've experienced from other Indian foods. The chicken was cooked well but the meat itself was sort of mushy. I would have also liked a bit more of the sauce. Compared to other Indian places this would probably rank in the middle but stands out for the price. So far, this is the best cheap eat I've found in  downtown core in terms of quantity."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Their lamb curry is bombbbb, and the price, unbeatable. One of my best Indian deli"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place.  I have never tried the food, because of the state of the restaurant itself, and the landfill alley they have lovingly cultivated the past two years.  This morning, unsurprisingly, two rats emerged from the alleyway as city garbage men retrieved bins from inside.  I knew a rat infestation was just a matter of time; in the summer, garbage water from the alley runs onto the sidewalk.  It smells rank.  I can't imagine anyone eating here.  I don't understand how the health department hasn't shut it down yet.  Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Was biking by and stopped in, got the chicken biryani daily special. Totally worth the 5 bucks tax in!  Have had better biryani elsewhere but not at this price. PSA: No raita provided and no salad just chicken and rice. Reasonably clean interior, didn't check out the exterior."}
{"text":"Hit and miss here. Chicken biryani is $4.99 (tax included) and is a big square box filled with fluffy biryani and two pieces of chicken. Butter chicken is $7.99 or something, and it also comes in a big square box. Half of it is a minimalistic green salad (kinda sad looking, actually), and not even very full at that, and the other half the box is filled with rice covered in butter chicken. About 10-12 chicken chunks, but not very big ones. Think skewer pieces of chicken. Yeah. The butter chicken was oddly sweet and didn't taste like most of the butter chickens I've had. I would liken their butter chicken to the sweet and sour chicken balls that people say are authentic Chinese food. Not. I'd definitely go back for the biryani. I wouldn't go back for the butter chicken."}
{"text":"Let's call this place \"a hole in the wall place\"...not in a bad way.   Just a block away from the Easton's Centre we saw the Daily Special sign and decided what can go wrong with a $5 (taxes in) meal.  The Sat special was Chicken with Rice with some curry sauce.   There was two pieces of chicken in a box full of rice.  Taste was good and represents a great deal!   Seating and service was good but don't expect this to be a fine dining experience.   It's a \"grassroots\" Indian experience at a great price!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday in the pouring rain.  It was dirt cheap. Possibly the only reason I rated it 2 stars.  The food was heated up in a microwave.  I got the tandoori chicken with rice and salad.  Salad was old. The chicken was flavourful. The rice was meh.  My friends got the biryani.  I was shocked at their portions.  Note : They do a student discount on top of their ridiculously cheap prices.  For that price, you have to wonder what kinda meat they're using.."}
{"text":"Curry Kitchen might not be a fine dining experience but their $5 chicken biryani is one of the best deals in town.   It is incredibly flavorful and a heaping filling. The meat just falls off the bone.   The staff is friendly and helpful as well.   If you're looking for a cheap, delicious, pleasant experience this is where it is at!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best lamb biryanis in town. Hard to find the real stuff in this city. Only 6.99. Great service, amazing food, affordable prices. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I go here for lamb briyani which is a special for Tuesdays and Fridays.  For $6.99, it is a great deal and it does not hurt that it tastes so good.  Huge portions too.  Be warned though that if you are buying after 5pm, be sure to call first because lamb briyani is sold out around that time.  I would normally call early in the afternoon and tell them to reserve 1 order for me and that I will pick it up after 5pm.  Works every time."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and this is my go-to lunch place. I am not going to lie and rave about the food but what you get for the price is undeniable that this is a great takeout lunch option. I typically go for their $5 chicken biryani special. You get 2 pieces of dark meat alone with a giant box of fluffy rice. I like the fact that they allow you to choose what kind of sauce you want on the rice; curry...butter chicken...etc. The sauce really adds that extra flavour to the otherwise bland rice. The chicken is tender and rice is a little overcooked but it does the job if you're looking for a decent affordable lunch.  I have tried the other options they have such as the butter chicken, curry beef...etc. They are again decent but nothing to really rave about.  All in all, a great, cheap $5 lunch fix!"}
{"text":"- I have tried:       + Chicken biriyani ($4.99): they gave me a huge amount of rice and sauce, but too little chicken. The biryani tastes so good, very well balanced. I got mild but found it still spicy for my taste.       + Beef curry ($7.99): I think its ok, beef was tender but there was nothing so special abt this. The sauce doesnt have much flavour as other curry       + Butter chicken ($6.99): chicken was hard, but I like the curry sauce, the salad that came with it was just lettuces and a bit of lemon juice w casear sauce  - Portion: very generous, lots of rice and sauce  - Price: Cheap biriyani, except for the curry (I would rather go to Curry&Co for butter chicken and other curry over this). But they do give you free tax if you pay with cash, and 10% off for students  - Place was big, lots of tables, convenient location for Ryerson students"}
{"text":"Great biryani for the price and downtown. Has lot of flavour, the meat is moist, the people there are very very friendly and the portion generiou. This is my go to spot if I am craving biryani downtown. For $5 all in its worth it and tastes great (not authentic enough but good enough for price point and downtown)"}
{"text":"5$ chicken briyani, they give you sauce.  Very filling, decent piece of meat. This is for when you need a mountain of rice for 5$"}
{"text":"Low prices. Food ok.   I had the veggie curry combo. Veggie curry, rice, samosa, salad: $5 tax included. Mostly cabbage, some potato, eggplant, corn, green peas. Rice a bit oily. Salad was mostly cabbage with a couple pieces of iceburg lettuce.   I have had the chicken briani here before too. Also $5. Good if you're hungry and only have $5. Not good if you want to eat delicious food."}
{"text":"This is the best biryani in the city! It's authentic, absolutely delicious, with large portions for a great price! The chicken samosas and the butter chicken are also delicious. I eat here almost every week. :)"}
{"text":"They have the chicken Biriyani for $5 and if you bring cash, they waive the tax on the orders too! The staff are understanding and quite pleasant and friendly. I would go there 3 nights a week for almost a whole year and I never had a bad experience. They even give extra curry sauce when you ask, with no charge.   The portions are decent size and you can get full on a single meal."}
