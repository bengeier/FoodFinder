{"text":"Not bad. I had a cheesesteak, and got the Steak-Umm style meat \"sheet\" thing. I thought it would be more like the chopped up steak. I will try again, but with a different sandwich.  Prices are more than fair."}
{"text":"Not a bad greasy sub place. Waffle fries are out of this world!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since the 80's / every time I go back though, it just doesn't seem good anymore. 50% of the time I end up with old bread and I really wonder how long they keep their meat... since it can be pretty slimey at times. It pains me to say it, but I probably have had my last Sharpy's sub. :("}
{"text":"Pathetic and over priced for what we were given.... Not impressed with this establishment...I believe over the years the quality has deteriorated from sharps....next time ur better off eating bread and that's it"}
{"text":"I started getting subs here 40 years ago when it was still called 3-S Subs. They made my favorite meatball sub EVER! It stayed exactly the same for over 35 years even as the name switched to Sharpy's 3-S Subs and then to just Sharpy's. Even though I had moved out of the area, I would stop whenever I was around to get one of those delicious, mouthwatering meatball subs. Suddenly, about 2-3 years ago, they changed it. Different bread, shorter bun with a slit cut in it and (less) meatballs tucked inside. Meatballs that used to have good textural consistency now fall apart when you bite into them and the sauce gives me heartburn.   Why would you change it after 35 YEARS??? If the owners of Sharpy's had a McD's they would probably be putting ketchup on Big Macs and finding ways to ruin the french fries.  After being disappointed by the meatball sub multiple times, I stopped the other day and tried my old backup favorite, the Sicilian Burger, only to find that it had undergone a similar demotion from a full sub bun to a large hamburger bun. Sorry, but if I'm going to pay $8 for a burger I might as well go to 5 Guys.  Prices continue to rise while the quality continues to slip. Goodbye, Sharpy's (sniff)."}
{"text":"I hadn't ate here in a few years. From what I had remembered, Sharpys made delicious tuna melts.  So of course, I ordered a cheeseburger sub, foregoing the delicious memory of the tuna melt.  Maybe I shouldn't have chased waterfalls. Perhaps I should have stuck to the rivers and the lakes that I was used to. Huh.  Something tasted burnt, despite me not seeing any char. The bread at the ends were hard, there was quite a bit of cheese oozing out of my sub that looked like Velveeta (I hate Velveeta). I wasn't impressed. I could hardly taste the meat as the taste of burnt was a bit overpowering and Velveeta was everywhere. Bummer.  The waffle fries were crunchy. Not the yummy kind of crunchy. Oh no. More like the, \"Oh man, I forgot about the fries in the oven!\" kind of crunchy.   No bueno. I was disappointed. I probably won't be back."}
