{"text":"Went here last week for dinner w some girlfriends. There were four of us and they sat us right in front of the door. So the entire evening we were chilly. The wait staff was very new (the owner said he was just hired that day) so we excused his not being familiar w the food or knowing much about wine. He looked very nervous!! But he got our order right. We shared a few plates family style as was recommended by the staff: tuna tataki, faux-sotto, roasted cauliflower and moureaux and some very expensive fries ($4 for tiny portion) All was ok but nothing stood out. If anything the cauliflower was a bit soggy and too spiced yet oddly lacked flavour and the maple jelly w tataki was not a good match for me (I prefer spicy tataki). The faux-sotto was the best. And the drinks were well made. Overall a moderate experience for a reasonable price.  Hopefully as the staff acclimatizes to working at a resto the service will be more professional. Definitely nice to see new restaurants in Verdun!"}
{"text":"I would suggest reserving online because the place it's self isn't that big and last night it was packed a la max.

They're closed Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and open at 6 the rest of the nights.

They have a lot of funky drinks to pick from but not that many beers as I was hoping to see. They have one drink called verdun luv that I must try :) !

Menu is only in french but it's pretty straight forward so if you need help just ask.

The food is crazy they have really great flavours and the way it's presented is very beautiful.

Very dark in here so good luck with pics my yelpers :)"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant Français nouvelle cuisine est un énorme coup de coeur. Tout était excellent. Du cocktail signature original aux plats en passant par le dessert et que dire des frites de parmesan à l'huile de truffles. Service amical et intelligent. Bravo à ce restaurant et longue vie."}
{"text":"Connaissez-vous la signification du mot succulent? Dans ce cas allez dans ce restaurant et vous saurez.
Excellente expérience ce soir. J'y ai emmené ma blonde et nous avons passé une super soirée.
D'entrée de jeux, les cocktails. En général je ne suis pas fan mais la...j'y ai redécouvert des saveurs! 
J'ai pris le tartare de boeuf et ma blonde le st jacque. Excellent.
Et pour finir un petit dessert : un moelleux au chocolat avec qlq bananes recouvertes d'un caramel croquant. 
Le service a la hauteur de la qualité des plats.
En bref allez y vous ne regretterez pas!"}
