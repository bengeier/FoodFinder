{"text":"Above average sushi at a reasonable price. The rice on the maki rolls is thin, which I appreciate. The quality is on par to Gals sushi on Highway 7/Warden. I ordered an 18 piece maki set for $13.95 for dinner. I went another time for lunch and was amazed that their bento box specials are so affordable. For $12.99 my lunch order included 16 pieces of maki, tempura shrimp/veg, tofu, rice, noodles, salad and miso soup. My only complaint is the spicy salmon and tuna rolls are filled with more panko crumbs instead of fish. I prefer Osaka on McCowan but I will definitely be back to this restaurant since it is so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good decent tasting sushi. If you have a sushi craving and are in the area come to this place.  The rolls are decent sizes. The quality is decent. The service is good.  They give you a salad, soup and some glass noodles as an appetizer.  I ordered the kame set and a maki set. Both there good. I think the only thing they can improve is maybe the taste? The rolls didn't taste anything special and I could really get the same tasting rolls anywhere.   The kame set was 8 pieces of sushi and one regular roll for $13.95 and the maki set was three rolls (California, spicy salmon and tempura shrimp) for $15.95."}
{"text":"(Food): They do have a variety of combos with just salmon sushi/sashimi but it is definitely pricey to get these combos.  The SALMON SET A consisted of 10pc of Sashimi, 7 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of spicy salmon roll. The salmon wasn't the best I've ever had so I wouldn't order that set again.  (Price:) This salmon set cost almost 23 dollars, which after tax and tip cost me close to $30.  I wasn't that satisfied with the dish and especially at that price point, I am sad to give this restaurant only 3 stars.   (Service:) adequate. Although yelp said that the store closes at 11 but that day it closed at 10."}
{"text":"Quick service and a good variety of lunch options but I think the quality could improve.   I had the ilbunji combo 1 that came with sashimi, sushi and your choice of roll. I chose the spider roll- the rice layer was very thin which I like but the actual soft shell crab tasted like it was refried. The batter was very hard. It also just came with cucumber in the roll. The sashimi also didn't have much taste.  My meal also came with a salad, miso soup and half an orange for dessert.  I'm visit this plaza quite often but have never noticed this place. It's hidden at the south side of the plaza but seems to have many regulars."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.  We always come here for sushi when we are in town.  Great value, fresh sushi/sashimi, nice staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I've always had a good experience eating here. The atmosphere is very calm and peaceful. The staff are friendly and helpful. Last time I came to celebrate my friend's birthday and they were very accommodating when we needed to store the cake we brought in their fridge and when we needed plates and forks for it.  Food: 5/5 No complaints here. I love their bento. It's more extravagent than a typical bento you'd find in a Japanese restaurant (however, also pricier). They have given us miso soup, salad and Korean Japchae with every order, as well as sliced oranges after our meals. The attached pictures show Bento #1 with teriyaki chicken, spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll, as well as the black dragon roll (dynamite roll with eel).  Cleanliness: 4.5/5 The floors could use a replacement but other than that, the store is well maintained.  Service: 5/5 Friendly, fast and accommodating."}
