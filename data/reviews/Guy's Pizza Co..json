{"text":"I usually go to Guys Pizza because it's close to my house and I hate going to Pizza Hut. Most of the time, they get my order wrong but it's not a big deal because any kind of pizza is good. But today takes the cake. It was bad enough they got my order wrong, I found hair in my first slice of pizza. I was so disgusted, I threw all my pizza away!"}
{"text":"I would not eat their pizza again if they gave it to me for free...go get a stouffer's frozen pizza and you will be better off.  I ordered from them once and I am a quick study so there will be no repeat business from me.

EDIT:

Thank God they put this place out of its misery."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! My favorite? A small pizza with spicy sauce, green peppers and banana peppers. Small so I don't have to share!! They never seem to busy but that's ok I don't like to wait!"}
{"text":"The only reason my rating is so high is the pizza was good.  We tried this place for the first time because they put a mailer out with coupons. Ordered a large pie with pepperoni and sausage. Phoned them an hour later, still no pizza. They offered to waive the $2.50 delivery charge and promised we would have it in 10 to 15 minutes. It arrived in 15 minutes, smushed against the side of the box. It was hot and tasted good. Either the sauce or the crust is sweet.  I just don't understand why it took so long, and why they did not tell us how long it would take. We ordered on a Friday night at 7:00, and we are one mile from them. $12.50 with the coupon."}
