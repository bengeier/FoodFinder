{"text":"Ok food and great service. The owners, family and staff really make the difference. Duncan is a great host and a pleasure to talk to. Small but comfortable atmosphere. 
Gate 403 brings in wonderful jazz talent and they promote young talent. 
Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best, not to mention far too pricey. I had ordered the burger with a side of fries and a drink, but instead received a salad instead of fries. When inquiring about the mix up, I was told \"You happy? No? You eat salad\". After being ignored for the next 20 minutes and subsequently eating the salad I was served, I finally managed to convince the owner to give me my plate of fries. The service was excruciatingly slow, though the supposed \" jazz\" (a single piano) was okay. 

Overall I give this restaurant bar a rating of 2 stars, since I did eventually receive my fries."}
{"text":"I've been stopping in here for an after work drink quite frequently of late. First of all: they have an actual happy hour from monday to thursday, with the added bonus of half price appetizers til 6. My regular bartender Jasmine is top notch, and I've always found the music to be pleasant but not overwhelming in terms of sound level. Recommended."}
{"text":"Year after year, still love this place just the same if not more. The food, music, and service have only gotten better. Coming here is so warm and welcoming, such a great vibe. Toronto is lucky to have a hidden gem like Gate 403 :)"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere! Good Jazz music with excellent bar choices. Food came fast and got more than what we expected. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific restuarant with amazing music. Everyone who loves Jazz music should come here to try the music and the food which is beyond my expectation !"}
{"text":"Love the food here and the service is great.
I attend the Saturday Afternoon (5-8) Blues and roots sessions quite often.
Always find a few faces I know in the crowd."}
{"text":"Very cool bar with great live  jazz music, the servers r nice & nice selection of beer on tap"}
{"text":"First time back here in over a year - was very pleased with the new menu (turns out there's a new chef in town); food was really good and the live music was as lively and entertaining as I remembered. Definitely recommend for a Friday night out (food + entertainment)."}
{"text":"This place is ok if you just want to chill and have a few drinks and listen to  jazz. Be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going and be sure to be there on time and not a minute late because they will give away your table. The food is ok and the atmoshphere can be described as cozy if you like to sit at tables that are an inch apart."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Food was incredibly bad and way too expensive for the quality we got. Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"Great place, great service! Live music daily!"}
{"text":"A very talented and musical friend of mine was playing a jazzy show here and I rarely if ever pass up an invite to hear live music. Almost every day of the week at Gate 403 you'll be sure to happen upon a few local jazz artists or bands who are simply playing their music for the love of it. Not only do I find this endearing, I also think it's perfect for those who wish to support local talent in Toronto. 

While Gate 403 is not a large space, it fits a nice crowd of people who are either there for the food or for the music. Both are safe bets if you ask me. Gate 403 is a mix between a pub and a piano bar and it seems to have something for everyone. Come in for the food and stay for the tunes, either way you'll be happy you filled your ears and of course, your belly."}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends on Thursday night (they had a bar rail cocktail special for $4)! You can't go wrong with $4 drinks and great company. Ordered the signature burger with fries, fish tacos, calamari and bruschetta.  Overall, the food and service was awesome! The burger is definitely a must try, especially with their fresh cut fries. Yummm"}
{"text":"While I think that, overall, Gate 403 is a great bar, the above four stars is not for the bar as a whole, but for the bar on Tuesday Nights.

While Gate 403 has a revolving selection of live jazz, for free, every night of the week, Tuesdays are especially great, as they are the night Julian Fauth plays. Tuesdays have been, for the last few years, a regular destination for myself and many others on and off the Roncesvalles strip, due mostly to the fact that Julian's style of blues (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZarpCUeykI, but this doesn't really do the live setting justice) is so great for either letting sink into the background as a wonderful setting for conversation and drinking, or for sitting quietly at the bar and attending to. 

Besides that the bar is notable mostly for great and friendly bartenders (except for Kate, who is really great and unfriendly), the fact that there is free music every night, and a good cast of nice regulars."}
{"text":"Great that they have live jazz music. The curry coconut ratatouille was delicious and priced fair. They only had one server when I went but service was still very quick."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 2. When I got there there was no accommodation and there was no place to even sit down. The management just said they were sorry but they forgot. The place was really loud. If you wanted to listen to the noise music it would be better to stand across the street. The music was clearer and not defining if you listened from there. I could not comment on the food because I had to go elsewhere for that. 
I found a great piazza restaurant a half a block south on the same side. The service and food was fabulous. I do not recommend Gate 403."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Just don't. Fish tacos were abysmal; the battered fish was soggy and there was zero crunch, flavour or redemption. Salsa with quesadillas tasted like it came out of a bottle from 1989. Band was too loud for the venue. Maybe come for a drink if you like jazz, but there are way better places on Roncy. My belly still aches from the food. Plastic folio menus were a good indicator of quality."}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't recommend the food here. 

Drinks are a fair price.

Music isn't bad on weekends. 

Service started out amazing but by the end of the night we had to pay with another waitress as our original disappeared into the night. 

Overall - not terrible, but not amazing either."}
{"text":"The Gate has good and bad points, but every experience I've had here has been positive. I gotta urge ya to sit at the bar; it's often a rewarding experience, had a great conversation every time. The music is often excellent, and it's really the reason you go, though the placement of the stage doesn't work well - it's too close to the bar, so it's hard to walk between the bar and the larger tables in the back. Frankly it gets inordinately loud, so beware. 

Beer prices are excellent (usually $2 below the Local across the street) and they know how to mix drinks - most of the time. The food is nothing to write home about, but I'm there for music, company, and drinks, so I don't mind."}
{"text":"when i am in the area this is one of my favorite places to stop by and chat with friends,  The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is good and if you are there on a friday or saturday night the music is intoxicating.  Even though i have not lived in the area for a decade, i still return every chance i get."}
{"text":"Laid-back non-pretentious atmosphere. The venue is a bit small for everyone to see the performers but the atmosphere is intimate and homey!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I used to basically live here Tuesday nights for Julian Fauth!

I held a business christmas party here and was taken care of BIG TIME!!!

love the owner, barmaids and everything about this place...

Calamari?? meh....its better for booze and tunes..."}
{"text":"While waiting for a table at Barque we came across Gate 403.  Is the 403 in reference to Calgary?  Perhaps the owners are from out West?  

There is live jazz nightly, though on this particular night (Friday night) they would only be on until 9PM.

There is no cover to see the band, but there is a tip jar.  The bar itself has a good selection of beers (both on tap and bottled) and a list of cocktails and wines.  

The music was pretty good.  The crowd was mixed.  You had couples, you had solo-ers, and music lovers alike.

Can't comment on the food as I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Warm, homey neighborhood gem. Attentive service, music nightly."}
{"text":"So far, this is the best place I have found to hear jazz on a Saturday night in Toronto.  You can still hear your conversation or you can focus on the music.  The drinks are great (as is the service).  Plus, it is a short walk south from the subway.  I'm eager to try the food--it looks good."}
{"text":"A lively cozy bar in front, a more relaxed restaurant in the back, has a piano, always live music whenever I go there, food is tasty, good drinks, great cheese plates. Friendly service. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Gate 403 Bar and Grill is a hidden gem in Roncesvalles that host live jazz and blues 7 nights a week. Performers include #Juno award winning artists such as Julian Fauth! Check out the calendar on their website to see the performance schedule, they're really good about updating it! 

403 SIGNATURE BURGER 4.5/5
PENNE PESTO 4.5/5
BRUSCHETTA 4/5
CAJUN SHRIMP 2.5/5 (could be because I'm not crazy about shrimp)
BBQ WINGS 3.5/5 (regular bar wings)

I tried their burger (Ground rib eye, pancetta, aged cheddar, caramelized onions, arugula, tomatoes, aioli served on a multigrain bun) and fresh cut fries ($14). Whenever I have this combo, regardless of how good the burger is (and it was pretty darn good), I focus more on the fries than the burger, is that weird? 

Anyways, I like my fries with a thin layer of crispiness on the outside and meltingly mushy on the inside (and not the powdery type of mushy). When fries have thick layer of crisp on the outside, it reminds me of my highschool cafeteria fries, which is not my preference. Gate 403 hit the nail right on the head with their fries, I will go back just for them.

Another solid entree is their penne pasta with red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes and baby kale in olive pesto sauce ($13). If you order this, do NOT forget to add the sausage (+$3), which is optional (but come on, it really isn't).

I also quite enjoyed the Bruschetta with Feta cheese, vine tomatoes, roasted garlic & balsamic drizzle ($9). The bread was crispy and the topping was seasoned perfectly. It seemed to be a rather big portion of bruschetta though, it can definitely be shared. 

Gate 403 also serves cocktails, martinis, sangrias and mangrias (the male version of sangria)! 

If you're looking for parking, there is a greenP lot within walking distance nearby."}
{"text":"Oh dear. I went on a Friday evening in April, expecting to hear Jazz. What I heard was so far from it. The band was driving people out of the bar. No Jazz, unprofessional music. I have been several times before, and they occasionally have good bands that actually play Jazz, but mostly it's a big miss music wise. 
Service is good, food is okay but perhaps expensive for what it is. But the biggest let down is a Jazz bar booking non Jazz musicians. Toronto is not devoid of good Jazz musicians! I'd stay clear of this place until they get a real booker and some better music."}
{"text":"Gate 403 is the definition of your cozy local bar. Always has a great crowd and live music. Has a wonderful array of drinks with bartenders who are able to conjure up drinks with funny names on a whim. The fresh cut fries are my favorite. I would say this is one of the gems in Toronto if you are looking to hang out with friends over good drinks and food."}
{"text":"Let me be clear, you come here for the music and vibe--not the food or service. Casual drinks or a date its a great spot. However, if you are planning on having dinner this is not the place. Very few waitstaff so the service is slow, even when they are around they are not attentive. Who brings over two waters for a table of four? food is typical bar fare and it is mediocre at best. If this place didnt have live music I really couldnt see a reason to come here unless i was desperate for a pint."}
{"text":"Love this place in theory... but the music is SO loud that it makes it tough to enjoy a great conversation along with your martini and jazz...  (BTW: I'm not even an old fart yet... I like my music loud and this place gets on my nerves).  BUT, if you don't want to talk, it's great for live jazz....  The food is OK - nothing to brag about but not a problem."}
{"text":"Great live Jazz every Wednesday!  Terrific atmosphere and very friendly people. 

Go for a drink and enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and jazz with my friends who live in the neighborhood. It was not one of their best nights but the company was great and the staff were very friendly. The food was decent though nothing to write home about. The live band did play a few lovely songs and I can see how if I were a local I would enjoy coming here on certain nights when I expect the music to be good and would enjoy just sitting back with my glass of wine."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night for a live jazz performance and casual drinks.  It wasn't too busy so there was plenty of seating.  The jazz band was situated right in the middle of the restaurant so you could sit infront or behind the band.  No cover to see the band but they pass around a tip jar.

Service was friendly and quick.  They have a good selection of beers on tap with pints ranging between $5-8, fancy coctails priced at $8.50 and house wine for $5/glass.

Food menu has the basic pub food with a few entrees.  I don't know if I would come specifically to have a meal but it's an option if we're looking for snacks like nachos, fries or wings."}
{"text":"I am super surprised to be one of the very few 2 star reviews for this place... 
As a place to grab drinks and listen to live music, I'd be willing to give this place a 3 star but the food and atmosphere were not the best.

I ordered the cheese Quesadillas (a commonly known safe bar food option in my opinion). It was very small for $9 price tag that came with it (three pieces) and every ingredient tasted like it came from a can (think pizza pocket!)

My friends ordered the garlic bread with cheese and the wings and again both of them said they were surprised about how bland the taste was.

My recommendation is eat before or after coming here and just come for the band...."}
{"text":"Never been out to the Roncy area of town but it seems like ive been missing out for so long. We were walkin up n down Roncy and couldnt decide on a place to eat. I just happened to stop by the door of this place to look at the menu, fod sounded good, and noticed a jazz band playin inside. Perfect for a nice relaxin night. 

Had the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich and boy oh boy it was one of the best southern fried chicken ive ever had. The chicken itself was so juicy and tender. Add in the awesome southern spices with the perfect amount of heat. N soft n fresh brioche bun. Sandwich comes served with fries. All for less than $15. 

Definitely a place worth checkin out."}
{"text":"A lovely evening out.

I would suggest reservations... particularly since visibility to the live acts is limited.

However it is a nice place to explore if you are in the area and enjoy jazz, blues and folk music. 

If you're down in the area, give me a heads up...I'd be happy to try and connect with you."}
