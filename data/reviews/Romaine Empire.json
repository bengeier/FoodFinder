{"text":"Horrible worst salad ever I'd rather not eat then eat here! I threw it away what a waste of $13."}
{"text":"update from the opening:  as usual--visited romaine empire--the prices remain a tad high. but the salads are good.  top notch cobb for $13.51.  

major deduction of stars for the chicken caesar wrap (11.85 with tax). it was a sad experience. if i ever get it again, next time i will ask for it to be freshly made, because the lettuce inside was brown and wilted. the MAIN reason i go to romaine empire is because of garde manger excellence--the lettuce is usually treated well. but in my experience tonight, the chicken caesar wrap i got was from the oldest part of their pile and filled with brown lettuce.  and also measly chicken--way less overall food than the simple three topping salad. don't get the wraps--stick with the freshly made salads instead where the lettuce is actually fresh and turned over.

to go from 4 stars to 5--simply make the prices slightly lower. For me, a 3 topping salad should be $11 (tax included).  i used to come here three times a trip back when it was romaine way across the food court. now it's down to a one visit per trip. i'd say tripling sales for $1 less per guest check would be a no brainer. perhaps compare the volumes of when it was in the location across the food court to where it is now.

lastly, one one weird thing is the acoustics when ordering.  it's near impossible to hear anything the workers say--although they can hear us fine.  must be the glass shielding the salad or the air conditioning pattern right there. but please someone test it out--it makes it easier if we can hear what they have to say when taking our customized salad order. i always need to ask them to repeat their questions/comments, etc"}
{"text":"I got a great \"create your own\" salad here today. The service was quick, serving was generous and ingredients were fresh. You will need to plan carefully so you don't get charged a high price if you add too many extras in your salad, but aside from that it was great. I would come here again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great find and definitely hits the spot after an unbelievably glutinous Vegas buffet. Salad was great and enough to share with my wife. The only note is that they toss the salad dressing into the salad.  A little too much dressing for me. The next time I will ask them to leave it on the side."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and healthy lunch option at forum food court. Deceivingly large portion sizes so you aren't left hungry. Staff is efficient and polite. Definitely a good choice that isn't a heavy and greasy fast food. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Been here twice both times my husband I shared a create your salad. We got salmon and shrimp in ours. Very yummy. My kids also got a salad for two it was $40..very pricey but good salads"}
{"text":"Large portions was enough for me and the bf great selection on toppings, good healthy option"}
{"text":"Cute name and $11 for a salad is a steal in Vegas but my beef here is that if you're looking for something mildly healthy this is pretty much your only option - only thing is, it's a salad place that doesn't have a single salad that comes without meat. Laaame. 

You can build your own starting at $11 but you're still paying a premium for the meat that you aren't getting. All things considered, they can do better. 

Very weird to see a salad place that not only isn't vegetarian, but doesn't have a single option sans meat."}
{"text":"The best salad inside the Forum food Court  at Caesars Palace you can make your own or you can choose one of the signature salad, everything is fresh"}
{"text":"Romaine Empire is the perfect name for a salad bar inside of Caesar's Palace. I was so happy to find a healthy option in the Forum Food Court. Even though it is still a little pricey ($20 with the premium protein option of grilled chicken) I thought it was well worth it for a fresh and delicious meal. The staff prepares the salad for you; you can choose from their suggested combinations or just point at which options you want. I loved the fact that they had mixed greens or baby spinach to use as the base, not just boring old lettuce. I highly recommend this place if you find yourself in Vegas and tired of the buffets and heavy food."}
{"text":"I ordered a Asian chicken salad, it was super delicious and the servings were huge!
If you are in the area, check them out!"}
{"text":"Clean eating.  This a menu board item.  No line.  2\" to make.  Easier than LAS airport. $14.59 with double hockey
Asian chicken salad"}
{"text":"Portions are tiny for what you pay for. For 10.99, you get a base salad, 3 toppings, and a dressing. The people working here give only one scoop - not even heaping - of each topping. Definitely not enough to go around the whole salad. I was able to finish my salad in 5 minutes, while talking on the phone, because of how small and paltry it was."}
{"text":"Romaine Empire is located inside the Caesar's Casino food court area. There are many good eats to choose from but if you want a salad this is the place. The line was long when I showed up and moved a little slow. I don't think it was the worker's fault but the people in front of me. Some reason they didn't seem to understand the concept. You either order a salad off the menu or create your own. Not hard but to some people it clearly was. 

I ordered the southwest chicken salad which came with beans, chicken, tortilla strips, corn, tomatoes, red onions and a green dressing sauce. I can't remember what kind it was but it was delicious. You could get the dressing on the salad or on the side. I always opt for the side because I hate salads drenched in dressing. They have a combo meal where you get a salad and barefoot wine for $15. I opted out since wasn't ready for another drink. It was a little pricey for the food but it was good, fresh and higher quality."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the strip that is fresh, simple, healthy, and wonderful.   Unfortunately I learned today that they're planning on closing it down and replacing it :("}
