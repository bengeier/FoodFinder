{"text":"I had a great experiance at The Dirty Pelican last. The drinks are.priced right, food portions were large and priced right.  This place is definatly going to become a hot spot in the nw valley!  This area of town has been waiting for a place like The DP.  

Support the lil guy and give it a chance. I am sure glad I did!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location for every different owner and incarnation of this place.  They have now re-opened and we by chance were passing by last night and thought we would come in and give it a try.   We walked in and wanted to eat on the restaurant side (as opposed to the bar)  Several of the staff looked at us, never said a word.  Finally someone said for us to sit wherever we want.  Several of the tables had dirty dishes on them, so we chose a booth with no dishes.  

When I sat down I discovered that I sat on an ice cube and then my wife and son both discovered stains on the lovely paper placemats.  We were then given laminated menus and were told that most items were not available; only the appitizers and hamburgers.  So, I chose the nachos and my son chose the chili fries.  My wife then ordered the \"Loaded\" hamburger but was told that was a typo and she would have to order a basic burger and then be charged $1.00 each for every additional item she wanted on it.

By FAR, this was the worst food we have ever eaten in the NW valley.  Not just bad, it was awful!  I really should open up my dictionary and find a word that is worse than \"awful\" to be accurate.  Every single thing we ordered was terrible.  Even the Coke was funky tasting:-/  How does a new place ruin Coke?

The only good part was our waitress was very nice.

Maybe this will get better with time, but a dirty restaurant with really bad food, and an incomplete menu, I told my family I would give it two months before it closed, again.  My son told me I was being too optimistic.

What did we do afterwards?  Well, my wife and son begged me to stop at the grocery and get dessert to cover up the sick feeling in their stomachs.

I was hoping for something good...and got a disastrous experience."}
{"text":"Had amazing services! Everyone was super friendly and.extremely nice. Food was amazing. Wasn't impressed with the bad.but everything else was perfect. BEST NACHOS EVER!!!  not ever joking!"}
{"text":"Please be very careful at this bar. My sister was slipped the date rape drug here. Very shady people gravitate to this location."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would give this place a second chance.  The service was mediocre and the drinks weren't great considering I ordered Grey Goose.  We ordered the chili cheese fries and it was completely disappointing!!!  The fries were drowning in chili and it was difficult to find very many french fries.  I would recommend that if this is the way it's prepared they should change the name to chili cheese fry soup.

I was told the band that night (11/02/13) is there often and their name was Sluggo, (or close to)  was ok but in my opinion needs to NOT play Michael Jackson - total flop!!!!

When the band starts they should also consider lowering the lights for better ambience."}
{"text":"It always baffles me how rude the staff is here and they are still in business, and if you read the reviews I am clearly not the only one that thinks this however I have tried several times always same results rudest staff ever"}
{"text":"I was excited that it finally opened, but as it stands, things are very, very sloppy. Don't count me out yet, I understand and appreciate growing pains. 

Here are my notes:

Why was the hand written note in magic marker, dated July 3rd, stating that the bar was closed due to \"repairs\" up for so long? WHY didn't someone take that down a month ago? For those that have driven by, you know what I am talking about. The Now Open banner sure was up for a while too. If details like that are any indication of how they will operate, I'll assume cash flow will be an issue quickly. 

No POS system, I was surprised to see actual cash registers and hand written tickets. Maybe this is a temporary thing, but me thinks not.

There obviously hasn't been much market analysis done, specifically with happy hour pricing. This will become an issue for the price conscious happy hour patron. Top Shelf, Dillion's, RTO Sullivan's, Tailgater's and even Streets of New York are smoking the current beer prices at DP. 

Why are there pint glasses, small mugs and large mugs?

The jury is still out on the staff and will be for a while, it is obvious that the majority of the striped shirts have very little serving experience. I'm not sure about behind the bar?  I sure hope a few of them get it together ASAP. How about a little training?

Maybe the owner/manager should spend a bit less time chatting and a bit more time making sure his operation gets off to a good start. Friday was not impressive at all. 

The menu, well, there is one. You can only sell so much booze.

I'm not in the business and don't have a dog in this fight, but I do like to drink and I do like the location. I've been pretty hard and presumptuous in my review too, this I know. Flame away, tell me I am wrong, tell me your perspective, tell me your experience so far."}
{"text":"I cannot come up with enough words to state how much this place SUCKS. The staff is too busy talking to each other to take drink orders and the \"bands\" they have playing here are old and fat. I can tell who the people are that are giving this place raving reviews - they are the wankers that have been kicked out of other bars or are so out of touch that they think that anyplace that will serve them a drink HAS GOT  to be a cool place. Stay away from this place. It's owned by the same guy that owns The Alaskan Bush Company. They are currently closed because of liquor license issues."}
{"text":"Haven't been back in probably a year because the last time we stopped by, the service was worse that I have ever seen.  There was one server and the bartender working.  They seemed to be more interested in their personal conversation than talking to customers.  Needless to say, we walked out after 10 minutes when no one came to take our order."}
{"text":"The wings are cooked in microwave taste like crap. And was told even tho I didn't eat them that I would have to pay for them or wait an hour till there was a manager on site. Poor poor customer service."}
{"text":"The name fits the place as it is definitely dirty, possibly the worst place I have ever been in. The service is slow and they act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your order. You had to fight to get into the restrooms because of folding chair blocking the way. Its as if they are trying to tick of customers so they won't come back if that is the case then to quote the immortal Creepy Pete \"just keep on doing what your doing\""}
{"text":"I don't want to write about the service.  Even though, I had an empty pint sitting for a few minutes to get a refill.  Not acceptable when only 8 people are in the place.  I don't want to write about the food.  I only had wings and they were ok, the 1/2\" chalky dried out end of one of the carrots was a bit gross.  I want to talk about cleanliness.  

It's rather ironic that the name is The \"Dirty\" Pelican because dirty it was.  In my nearly 2 decades of drinking in a bar this is the worst that I've ever been to.  As I was sitting there for my 1pm beer I immediately had to ask the barmaid for a rag because the armrest on the bar was so sticky.  The bar napkin I originally tried to use turned up black and sticky.  The mirrors behind the bad were all spotted up and smudged, the bar had crumbs and gunk all around the edges, and all the metal sheeting infront and behind the bar had smudges and drip marks all over.  The floor looked clean and the tvs were free of dust so I know that they do some cleaning.  They just pay no attention to detail and I fear what the kitchen looks like. The kicker is that the manager or owner was sitting at the end of the bar b.s.ing the whole time. I'll never eat there again.   

I can't say that I'll never go there for a beer.  It is very convenient if I'd rather drive a few blocks instead of a couple miles."}
{"text":"This place is probably closed by now.  Heard it was from the rumor mill.

I hate to say it makes me happy because I really try to support local spots.  This one is so close to my house and I want it to be good so badly.  Its been through at least three different names/owners over the last couple years (Hammerheads, Portofino's Beach Bar, and Dirty Pelican).

Every one of them were horrible.  Mediocre food at best.  Decent drink prices but the ambiance is just atrocious.  

Ever want to have a beer at Wal-Mart or your local aquarium store?  Me either.  This place is a cross between them.  Unappealing, uninviting, just poor all the way around.

Advice to the new owner...  Change the beach theme and lose the aquariums.  The place needs to be gutted.  Make us want to come in and when we get there give us service that makes us want to stay.

The last time I was in there we had pretty bad service from the bartender.  He didn't notice us for quite a while sitting at the bar after we arrived (it was slow).  Then it was just poor from there on.  He didn't seem to know the food specials.  My wife and I both gave each other the \"wow\" look.  How does the bartender not know the happy hour specials?

Turns out we get our bill and the guy (bartender) tells us he is the owner and to come back again soon.  WHAT!?

If owned a bar..."}
{"text":"Microwaved food and I had to wait 10 minutes just to get a soda. Music is INSANELY loud for such a small space; wear earplugs and you can still hear every note. People are playing on phones or texting cuz you can't physically talk to one another."}
{"text":"We've been here on and off, and everything has just been good enough.   But recently they've done something with the wings that makes us want to keep coming back.  Juicy inside with just enough crunch on the outside.   OMG best wings near us for sure. 

If you're looking for a dive atmosphere decently priced drinks and amazing wings, come on over!"}
{"text":"3 stars for what it is.  It is a bar.  I thought the service was good, and the drinks we ordered were done well.  The price for cocktails wasn't bad.  For a Friday night it wasn't a bad crowd.  We did order off the menu and it was o.k.  We got zucchini and mushrooms.  Limited menu nothing on there we really wanted, and settled for what we got.  I think the biggest problems there is first and foremost they are trying to be something they aren't.  It is kind of like they haven't figured out what they are.  They should run with the bar, and a better grill.  Need booths too-high seats aren't comfortable long term.  Menu needs some work. So if you are looking for a good drink at a good price, and maybe some average bar food this could be your place."}
{"text":"Can you say bar rescue!  Very slow and a local drunk handout spot. Wings were ok but soda nasty.  A few of the men working there (may be the owners) were in shorts and one in a tank top.  Not what you want to see in an owner because it set a standard that dirty and sloppy are ok. Went for the UFC fights - the only positive was no cover. All the female staff had short shorts and most had a bunch of tattoo's. Just a small no class dive bar. Got two stars only because the wings did not make me sick the next day."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst bar I have ever been to. I heard it was a shitty, so I wasnt expecting much. But this place really WOW'ED me..in a bad way. How is a bar this shitty open? And has been open for 4 years? Is this a money laundering front? From the decor, music system, lighting, and employees..all bad. From the moment I walked in the front door, this place just gave me the ultra-divey feel. And \"divey\" is usually not a bad thing. I love a little hole in the wall bar. But this is divey in a \"needs Jon Taffer to resuce\" way. You cant tell who works here because they have no uniform and wear whatever. They have no idea what they are doing, and even with a completey empty bar, it takes forever to get a drink. They under pour. So many bad things about this place, I would be writing this review for days if I wanted to keep going. This bar needs HELP! Close the place down and put something there worthwhile..

Pro tip: Dont order anything with more than one ingredient."}
{"text":"The only reason they got one star is because you have to choose one. Went in today to watch some football, have some drinks and use a coupon we got in the mail. Service was horrible, the staff was so consumed with giving out free drinks and food to their friends that what I thought might be an hour turned into two. The \"bloody Mary bar\" and I use that term loosely was right across from the men's restroom and apparently they are taking the term \"dirty\" in their name litterally, this place was filthy and completely over priced for what they offered. With all of the restaurants around they will not last long. When I finally was able to check and use my coupon it took another 15 mins and six people to figure out how to take the coupon off. What a joke, save your time and money and drive down the street. Makes sense now why this place is never busy. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had checked in on a friday night 2 weeks ago.  Since then, I have been asked by numerous people if this venue has improved in the customer service area.  So I decided to update my review to convey my experience here at the 'Dirty P'.  

First, it was a friday night, and though not busy, there was a decent amount of people in here.  And the friday night crew was efficient, yet indifferent.  If you are expecting warm and friendly greeting and service, you won't get that.  However, the 2 working the bar stayed on top of it. That is all I expect of a place like this, so that is a big improvement.  

Atmosphere is a tad better; they changed up the dining area, and we had just missed the band.  There is also cornhole in the patio, and that is fun and cool.

  I had watch the girl bartender make my margarita, and she only put a quick splash  of alcohol (I am not exaggerating when I said splash, it was like a tablespoon of tequila) and filled up the rest with ice and whatever magarita mix they use.  I tasted it, and promptly told the male bartender, Nick, that I need just a bit more alcohol.  He fix the problem immediately. Very nice change than last time, where I could not get anyone's attention for a second drink.  

Mixed clientele.  Pretty interesting.  From bikers to golfers.

Why only 2 stars?  Because it still falls under the 'Meh. I've experienced better' definition put out by yelp.  My negative experiences outweigh the few postive.  For those that have asked have they improved? yes, kinda."}
{"text":"Was there Friday night and the band was fantastic!

First let me say, I witnessed 2 conversations between the owner and 2 staff members and he is a nightmare!  Now I know why the staff is not attentive, why they look like they are being forced to work there and why they plain old just don't give a crap!

The recently closed down to make \"improvements\" and what a waste.  They also rearranged the set up and dance floor and the layout is stupid!  The dance floor is way too small.

The band brought in a great crowd, I mean when the tables were all full at the same time as the dance floor and there are people standing at the door waiting for a table, you have a potential for a successful place!  Not so here with the lack of customer service and just plain inattentive wait and bar staff.  I stood at the bar for no less than 8 minutes before I was even looked at by the blonde girl behind the bar.  It was almost like she did everything she could to ignore me!  Then when she did look at me, she first walked over to the couple sitting right next to me and asked them for a drink refill and did that before she took my order.  Now in normal situations and at a successful bar, I would never have to belly up to the bar to place my drink order as there would be staff going around the tables TAKING drink orders but here, you are lucky to see anyone walk around but maybe once about every 20 minutes.  

Throughout the night, most of the people I knew and didn't had to go to the bar to order drinks yet there were wait staff around, where, I'm not sure as they certainly weren't working taking care of customers.

Next, go into one of the two womens bathrooms, the sink (where patrons and employees are to wash their hands) was stuffed full of a trash can, a plunger and something else that was all rusted so no one using the bathroom could wash their hands INCLUDING EMPLOYEES.  I guess that doesn't matter since they weren't serving drinks any way!!!  The men I was with said both Mens bathrooms had no soap in them ...YUCK!!!!

Air conditioning???  We live in Arizona and the last 2 times I've been here, it's been hot as hell.  Maybe a plot to get people to drink more?  Okay, I'll go with that but that strategy doesn't work if you don't have your staff available to take drink orders.  TURN UP THE A/C cause your staff isn't available to take drink orders, not even at the bar!

Last, the fact that the sign outside on the front of the building has 50% of the lights out and god forbid you hadn't been there before and were trying to find the place, unless you were looking for \"PELICAN\" you'd never know you where there!  This in itself pretty much sums up the lack of keeping this place in \"working order\" shows that the owner is running this place further into the ground.  Don't be surprised if this place goes under soon..."}
{"text":"Worst bar I have ever been to. Service is so bad. Sat at a table that was dirty and took 5 + min to even be noticed by a server. Had to ask her to remove dirty dishes and wipe down table. A rough older crowd that are not nice to anyone new. Will not be back. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Well.. Service still slow, but I enjoyed the new menu! Also, they partly changed the place [no more fish tank and they added t.v.'s everywhere plus added a dance floor and 2 new pool tables. They still need to add a new paint job to the walls to improve the quality and maybe add large booth seating. Overall this place is still a dive bar. I have to say our waitress is awesome because she gave us another round of bbq rib sliders on the house, so this bar does have hope... Try the rib sliders. It's a real deal."}
{"text":"Visited this place on Thursday 11/3. I was happy to see that the new owners have tried to overhaul the interior a bit. They moved one of the big fish tanks so the restaurant is more open now. The dining area now has some cohesion with the bar area rather than the \"split personality\" feel you got when this place was run under various different names. 

I was REALLY impressed with the food. The quality and quantity was very good. If food quality was the only deciding factor in rating this place I would happily give it 5 stars. Unfortunately for The Dirty Pelican service level is equally important when it comes to rating a restaurant. I was REALLY Unimpressed with the service. It was painstakingly slow. Our whole dinning experiences (dinner for three) took a whopping 1 hour and 25 minutes, and that wasn't because we were taking our time to enjoy the ambiance! Also, the staff's knowledge of the menu was pretty poor.

Since the food was so good I will definitely return to this place and hope that the management solves the service problems. I would like to see this restaurant succeed."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends from Glendale go to this bar frequently so when I was in town this last weekend I decided I would tag along. I do understand that it is a dive bar so I'm not basing my opinion on how nice the place was, it is mainly to do with the service. First of all the bar tender was decent, but I was there on a Monday night so obviously there weren't that many people and it felt like I was waiting a lot longer than I should have to get my drink, this was the case with all of my friends. It took equally as long to pay her, because immediately after serving our drinks she went onto other customers so we had to wait another ten minutes to either pay or set up a tab. I don't mind waiting, but when the bar is this empty I don't feel like it should take 15 minutes or more to get just one drink taken care of. She also gave my boyfriend the wrong debit card back when he closed his tab even though we told her his name three times. I am usually excepting of honest mistakes like that, but once again there were very few people at the bar and it was only us who were closing out so it just seemed to be more of a case of carelessness and not paying attention. Luckily they still had his card with no charges on it the next day.

Next, I had no idea that there were waitresses, but apparently there were 3 or 4, but not once did they come to our tables to check on our drinks or take away the empty ones. When I actually figured out who they were it was obvious that they were only taking care of one group (probably their friends) and were more concerned with playing darts and karaoke than their job. I just don't understand the point of having waitresses if they don't come around to every table at least once.

Last, we were there on Karaoke night and the DJ was probably the worst Karaoke DJ. There was a contest going on, but he didn't really announce it so there was only about 4 participants, who were all coincidentally the group of people that the waitresses were hanging out with. So it felt like no one else had a chance to participate at all which kind of defeats the purpose of Karaoke night if the same four people are singing the whole night. So correct me if I'm wrong but if only four people are singing then the contest shouldn't take that long, at least not the whole night (which it did), so literally no one else got a chance to sing, and again the waitresses got to sing whenever they wanted. When none of the participants were singing the DJ just played really awful slow songs instead of letting anyone else take a turn. 

The only good things were that there were a lot of dart boards, and the space was very open so even if there were a lot of people it wouldn't be crammed. My drinks were also pretty strong too. Clearly don't go on Karaoke night, and don't expect the waitresses to do any work."}
{"text":"Well after all my bad reviews I thought I'd give the good old dirty another chance. My friend has been telling me to get in there and it's actually cool. I was wary but decided to join him for a beer. And the funny thing...I actually had a good time!

Well my last time at Dirty was back I. Jan 13 and I've stayed away ever since. Mainly because of poor service. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw 2 full time bartenders, a bar back, and at least 6 servers in the bar. Things looked better already. When I was treated very promptly I ask her what the good beers were and she said \"Odell's IPA\". I couldn't believe it?!? Odell's IPA...he'll ya! After that and seeing. Workers actually working and a good positive seen this place has improved greatly. I'm still reserved a little so ill have to go back a few more times and maybe ill give them another star. I did not try the food which I will next time. 

Overalls either I was expecting the worse and had a good time or it really was just a good time. Ill check out Dirty again soon!"}
{"text":"Shady crowd! Shady owners! Service is hit or miss!
Some bartenders are great! Others not so much. 
It's nice that this place isn't a corporate place and has a very wide selection of liquor and beer that changes constantly, down side to that is you have to see it to get it...servers/bartenders alike have no idea what they are carrying behind the bar....I guess I'll just stick to the coors light and well whiskey instead of getting a craft beer or a 12 year aged whiskey that I can see on the shelf and ask for it just to be told \"we don't have that\" 

Upsell! Get my tab higher! Get a better tip while you make money for the business! Open your eyes! 

I still come back only because it's the closest place to home base.

Forgot to mention the countless fights I've seen between guests that happen very frequently! Even worse when you see the kitchen staff run out to fight some poor drunk people. Of course the police don't come and the owner is present with close to no reaction of what is happening! 2 stars for overall experience. 5 stars for the shadiest place in north glendale!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty cool summer hang out when in need of hanging with friends and having a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. Its a seedy bar in a nice neighborhood.  The stories that riddle this restaurant's history are endless.  I only gave it 2 stars because its in walking distance of my house (coincidence) and they have good grilled hot wings.  Other than that the service blows, the bands blow, the food is average at best and I have been there many times when they have ran out of beer, including domestic beer.  WTF.  Anyhow, this is what you get when your sister business is one of the lower class strip clubs in town."}
{"text":"Band rocked!
Food was wrong after it took 55 minutes for a hamburger.
Even the drinks (beer) was wrong.
But the band rocked!"}
{"text":"Worst bar I ever went to. Service was shit. Cause the girls only took care of regulars or they talked too much amongst themselves. I went there 1 year ago and i never went back. Zero customer service. The owners a dick too."}
{"text":"Great bar. Very responsible!!! I saw 2 underage girls claiming to be from Illinois tonight trying to get served alcohol. The very responsible bartender turned them down and sent them on their way. Very proud of the Pelican tonight!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped to see what this was all about.  We were pleased at the service.  Our waitress was amazing....Food was good...Drinks very resonable...Will go again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Sorry but I actually enjoyed this place. Sure the building is a bit of a dump, but they are supposedly remodeling soon.  Hopefully they fix the bathroom too as only one stall in the men's room worked. The floor all over the place is beat up and they are in the process of getting rid of a lot of the \"fish and beach\" stuff.  My guess is it will be a standard sports bar but maybe they will go with a country/western theme or Irish Pub?  Who knows.  Besides the decor this place was actually pretty fun. Patrons were friendly and outgoing and the bartender made small talk with us.  They had karaoke and we got to sing right away because no one was here.  I'm excited to see what they do with the remodel.  They will probably have a new name and theme so this review will soon be pointless."}
{"text":"Such an unfortunate waste of space. The place has huge potential to be a phenomenal neighborhood bar. The staff had me waiting long enough to order a beverage that I was playing on my phone in order to waste time. They were too busy chit chatting about their personal life drama out loud instead of tending bar. When they finally did help me both bartenders had zero clue on pouring the proper 4 count. I ordered two different shots and they made up their own recipe. As a former bartender I would not recommend this place to anyone. Sorry Dirty Pelican but I recommend a phone call to bar rescue..."}
{"text":"How in the world is this shit hole in such a beautiful neighborhood? This area deserves a great neighborhood bar thats friendly, clean, and safe. Saddness. Disappointing. No other words to describe this bar. Someone call \"Bar Rescue\""}
