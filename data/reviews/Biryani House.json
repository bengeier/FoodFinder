{"text":"The score should be negative. Its HORRIBLE. The have like 6-7 items in their buffet. No naans or salad. The items were either bland or stale. My friend had a potato curry which was completely stale without salt. The biriyani was okayish but bland. Would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience here.  I had been there some time ago before I was writing on Yelp.  I had only been there for their weekday lunch all-you-can-eat buffet.  The price was $11.99 and I thought it was just fantastic.  Large selection of foods on the buffet, and it was fresh.  My recent experience with their sitdown menu service was a good experience, although it was a slightly slow one.  In their defence though, it was January 2nd, and I don't think they were really expecting to have alot of customers for their dinner service. That aside though, the service was decent enough, and the staff was very friendly. I really enjoyed the food.  The samosa appetizer was absolutely phenomenol, and my entree was Calcutta Chili-Chicken, which is kind of like an Indian version of a Chinese Sweet/Sour dish.  Not overly sweet, but definitely on the sweet side.  Not as hot as I would have liked it, but I think adding heat to your food at this restaurant isn't a problem at all. My entree was $13.95 which I thought was a little on the pricier side, considering the size of the portion, but the quality of the food was awesome.  The location of the restaurant is great, with it directly across from Wellesley subway station, and there is a car-park right beside the restaurant.  I would definitely go back to this place again.  Good for large groups too as the dining area is large and open."}
{"text":"Sorry to say but this place was by far the worst place I have had food in the US. The Meat was undercooked, the rice tasted bland and the service was horrendous. Pretty sure the 5 star reviews are fake. I don't generally write reviews but I had to for this place. Would give it 0 stars if I could"}
{"text":"I was very enthusiastic when i first went to try biryani house for dinner as the menu from the website looked unique and very appetizing, with some unique indian dishes not found at other restaurants... but the food didnt taste as good as the menu makes it seem and i was quite dissapointed. It's overpriced for the quantity and quality. The heaters werent on and I was freezing throughtout my meal, hardly a pleasant experience. The service was poor, making us wait for long amounts of time, even though the restaurant was not very busy. I would not recommend this restaurant at all for dinner."}
{"text":"Visited this place today one of the best HYDERABADI dum biryani I had in Arizona. Some improvements required but still best  no other authentic Hyderabad biryani place like this around"}
{"text":"Tried this place after the Pride parade in 2010, and were disappointed.  We've been to a dozen or more Indian Restaurants in the city, and this ranks amont the bottom third.  Food was acceptable, but just, and nothing stood out.  The second floor windows looking out over Hayden Street are nice, but the food doesn't make up for it.  Can't even recommend this place for buffet lunch.  Go to Aroma or Dhaba on King Street instead."}
{"text":"Discovered this place few weeks back. Definitely the finest hyderabadi cuisine in the valley. Their chicken biryani, dum ka chicken & double ka meetha are my favorites. The restaurant owner is very polite and courteous."}
{"text":"The food at Biryani House is excellent.  Large portions, perfectly spiced, excellent flavour.  The atmosphere is not the best, but the food more than makes up for it.  We will dine there again in the near future."}
{"text":"I am not Indian so it is really hard for me to compare for other very good Indian restaurants on mom's cooking.. but their food was very reasonable. We enjoyed the chicken and the kofta (i think this is how you call it). the nan and the rice were also ok. overall a reasonable restaurant, nothing fancy, not to expensive. an OK experience if you are around and you want some Indian food.   PS: it does take them a bit too long to cook and serve the food and the restaurant werent full when we got there, so consider it if you are in a rush"}
{"text":"Service there is TERRIBLE! We were seated at our table, 15 minutes later, we got our menus and then had to wait another 15 minutes to get water and have our order taken. They are so disorganized that we had 2 different people come and try to take our order after we already did. I can understand if they were busy service can be slow, but there were only 4 other tables with customers.  I could see other people looking around for their waiter so they can order. One table complained to the waiter that they have been waiting for an hour and a half for their food. On top of that, their order was wrong and the waiter tried to tell them that what they were eating was chicken, even though it was really lamb.  Our food went to the wrong table and our waiter got yelled at by who I am assuming is the owner in the middle of the dining room. When our food did arrive, they forgot our naan and so we had to wait for that. When we asked for water, we had to wait 15 minutes and had to ask two people for our check when we were done  Another table next to us kept receiving doubles of everything they ordered, even though they ordered one. When they tried to put in another order for take out, the waiter came by 3 times to verify the order and he still couldn't get it right. Finally, the man at that table told the waiter to \"be attentive and listen closely\" to what he is ordering because the waiter could not get it right to save his life.    I was wondering why there were hardly any customers in the dining room on a Friday night, but now I know why!! Avoid this place!  I registered on Yelp just to write this review because it was one of the most worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually signed up for Yelp just to write this review.  I ordered from Just-Eat.ca at 5:30.   At 6:45 I call to check on the status of my order. They say the driver has already left.  At 7:09 I call again, they say he is on his way.  At 7:25 I call again, they say to wait ten more minutes. I cancel the order. Let me elaborate - I am not a 40 minute drive from this restaurant, nor should the food have taken over an hour to prepare.  Two hour 'delivery' is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The combination of tender flesh and devine aroma is how I would define the Dum Chicken. I have been for sure hooked by the restaurant permanently.  Proper , Authentic Haleem and Kheer were equally amazing and mouth watering.  What makes this place even better is the host of the restaurant who caters according to customers needs."}
{"text":"We tried vegetarian briyani.  It was gud. Paneer butter masala was not gud. Paneer was something bad.we told the owner about it. He didnt charge for paneer butter Masala. They had moong dhall ka halwa and rasamalai. Both were gud."}
{"text":"The butter chicken is pretty excellent, and doesn't cost a lot. The service isn't too attentive, and the place looks somewhat in need of renovations. For an inexpensive bowl of butter chicken, you could do a lot worse. It's never very busy."}
{"text":"Some of the best indian in Toronto - but there's a catch.  Be sure to get TAKE OUT ONLY. If you eat in, the service is bad and you get less food! So take out is the way to go - I have never been disappointed with take out.  I LOVE the shrimp vindaloo and the butter chicken. YUM."}
{"text":"Best chicken biryani rice in Tempe. The spices are just right and the portion is just nice. They have $5 plate chicken biryani with 2 pieces of chicken. It's not in the menu but when I asked they have it. The one in the menu has large portion and can be eaten by 2 people."}
{"text":"We went here because it was hyped up to me. But honestly, it was gross. I've had better Indian food at more chain-type Indian restaurants in the suburbs like Bombay Bhel and Saravanaa Bhavan. The space was greasy, the bathrooms greasier. It still had white table cloth service, which I guess makes it...classy?  The samosas had super thick, super deep fried crust. The curry might as well have been heavy sauce out of a can. On the plus side, I did learn how to eat Indian food properly with my hands (take a small piece of naan and pinch some curry with it, don't make a giant naan curry taco like I've been doing all along).  Mango lassi was decent.  Located just across the side street entrance of Wellesley station with the 80s style green facade and big red lit lettering."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I don't think people know what \"good or decent\" Indian food is. Just adding huge amounts of masala/spices do not make it Indian.   Wish there were better authentic Indian restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"What a pleasure and delight for a foodie. I had reshmi kebab , mirchi ka salan , chicken 65 at Biryani House. I don't mind saying that Biryani House has been by far the best Hyderabadi Cuisine I had till date. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have spent nearly every birthday, some valentines days, and some anniversaries for the past 6 years eating at Indian restaurants.  i was excited to try a new place right across the street while here in TO on vacation. I was totally drawn in by the sign outside offering 35 items for a lunch buffet.  I don't know where to start once we got inside.  The place needs a complete overhaul of look inside. Yes, you expect indian restaurants, by and large, to look very tacky. But tacky is one thing. Completely gross is another. And oh yea, fix the air conditioner, it was hot and sticky inside. I have included photos of the floors, just in case you were wondering.  Our server: well, almost immediately after he sat us, besides one other couple, we were the ONLY people there, i believe he chose to forget we were there. There was no service. Getting a water refill was like pulling teeth. Getting his attention to get the check? Yea, good thing we weren't in a rush to get anywhere. And in the 10 seconds it takes to look at the bill to make sure it's right and to put the credit card in the billfold, he disappeared. Don't think we saw him again for another 10-15 minutes. Took longer to get the bill paid (requesting it, receiving it, paying for it) than it did to eat lunch.  The food: eh, just eh. There were only a few main dishes. butter chicken (in the US, it's commonly called Makhani), which i had thought would be tandoori chicken in sauce, but instead was bone-in chicken. good sauce, decent cuts of chicken, though mostly legs, very little white meat. there was a beef dish, but the beef was so tough to cut and chew, that we didn't even eat it. there was a goat dish, which we did not try. A tandoori chicken with no sauce (again, mostly legs). And some veggie options.   Then were was a small little bar behind it with some small bowls of things that had flies all over them, so we didn't eat those. I would guess only about 15 total items, including the ones that the flies liked.  I mean, it was ok, but I wouldn't ever go back."}
{"text":"While going through the city trying to experience Indian food in all it's glory, I was compelled to visit Biryani house. Sure, they are also one of the few good values when taking a trip to Church and Wellesley area for some rainbow-filled fun. It was decent for dinner. A bit like Babur in that they serve 'fanci-fied' Indian food that may be tastier at $4.99 than the $14 items they offer. Ingedients may be fresher, sauces a little more complex, but overall, I prefer the mom and pop Indian restaurants around town. A good deal if your headed to Pride week, though."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with work colleagues on Dec 23rd.  All of us promptly got food poisoning the next day.  Nice xmas present indeed.  Food was lukewarm, buffet plates were greasy and poorly washed, dishes were mis-labeled, restaurant was cold and drafty.  After checking City of Toronto Dinesafe website, it seems this restaurant got a conditional pass due to inadequate food temperture control, missing food handling certificate.  See the other Yelp reviews for more 'colour'....needless to say I'm never returning and probably going to share my review with the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"Biryani House seemed attractive at first, with its easily accessible location (right across from Wellesley subway station) and a very affordable buffet menu. But after a couple of visits there I've come to realize that it's too good to be true.  Why? The food is pretty good - they make a tasty eggplant bartha and roast up tandoori chicken that's tender and flavourful. The buffet will often rotate items so you can find something new to try .Basics like butter chicken, chana masala, pakoras, kofta and saag paneer are all done decently, though I've had better in Toronto for similar buffet prices. At the prices on the regular menu, I'm not convinced that the quality of the food would be worth what you'd be paying, but you can load up your plate at lunch with some tasty stuff.   But what's my biggest strike against this place? Terrible service. We came into the restaurant for an earlyish lunch and it was totally empty - no one was even around to seat us, ask us about drinks or even bring by a menu. After sitting down for a moment and getting no response, we just headed on up to the buffet. The staff were sort of shadowing us the whole time we looked it over. One of my companions wasn't all that familiar with Indian food and the staff were a bit brusque and not very helpful when she asked about the preparation of different dishes. We ordered mango lassis that took forever to arrive (though they were refreshing and sweet.) Perhaps most strikingly, there was no naan available when we arrived! No naan? At an Indian buffet? Really? When we asked, we were told that it would be brought to our table... it never happened, and when we checked up on it they denied it entirely. We finished up, and our bill was rushed onto the table before I'd even had a chance to let them know I was going to order some masala chai.   If you care about half decent service, don't visit Biryani House! Otherwise, the lunch buffet is OK, moreso if you're lucky to get one of the better-than-average dishes on the rotation."}
{"text":"An average Indian buffet.   The pakroas are nice and crunchy and taste great! I like the sauce that you can use on them. The butter chicken is pretty good, as is the curry goat, but the rest of the selection consists of the average tasting usual suspects (chana masala, paneer, etc).  It's quite a big restaurant with huge windows overlooking the street, so I'm giving this 3 stars because of the atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Horrible Service , Never eat here I got the worse case of food poisoning ever ."}
{"text":"Great authentic biryani with balances spices.  A must try in Tempe.   One of my favorite spots to go in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Note - this review is based upon delivery from orderit.ca  I found Biryani House's food on the boring side.  The seekh kebab tasted quite similar to a hot dog.  Usually if there is going to be a down fall for a kebab, it is that its greasy.  Never have I had one taste like a hot dog.    The channa masala looked very much like a can of baked beans.  It was lacking in flavour.  The heat seemed a bit out of place for the channa, like it was trying to compensate for the lack of flavour.  The only highlight was the whole wheat tandoori roti.  It had great texture and flavour.  If you are thinking of ordering Indian from orderit.ca - pass on Biryanai House"}
{"text":"Not good at all! The five star review is not at all trustable...Its kind of waste of money.."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant because my friend suggested it to me.This is one of the restaurants that reminded me of authentic Indian food. The food is very good and freshly made. I am a huge biryani fan, and I loved the biryani that they had here. Definitely would recommend giving it a try.   Despite the bad reviews mentioned by other people, I highly suggest that you judge by yourself. I loved it and I think you would too."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. You feel so welcomed and at home. I've tried Indian food all over this country and this place is probably my favorite for the best tasting food and customer service. If your not eating here you missing out! I recommend the butter chicken, because you've never tasted butter chicken this good before."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the Church & Wellesley Village (across the street from the Wellesley subway/bus station), this restaurant located on the second floor or 25 Wellesley Street East offers traditional Indian fare at affordable prices. Being one of the few Indian restaurants in the vicinity that offers an all-you-can eat lunch buffet, the place can see traffic most days from 12:00 - 2:00pm, but otherwise it's slow throughout the rest of the day. Food is good, however selection of desserts is small and waiter service can be slow.  I had to flag a waiter just to request naan bread that my original waiter told me he would bring over but never did. Otherwise, it's a good spot to have a meal and people watch (walking on the street and congregating in the patio of the bar next door)."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars to this restaurant.   Me and my friend visited this restaurant for a Friday lunch. The moment we were seated, we were served with a bottle of water.   And the gentleman who came to take the order didn't give us any menu but said stuffs in words. Just because we know what biryani means it doesn't mean we have come to eat only biryani.   With out choice, We ordered chicken biryani and mutton biryani. It took almost 30 min to get the dish to our table. The moment I ate, I realised rice and meat were burnt and I could feel the sour salty taste. I thought it was bad only for couple of spoons. But, After having 3-4 spoons I was done. Food was edible enough to eat.   I called him and explained it's burnt and the plate was left with 75% of food and taste is very bad. And not even close to eatable condition. He said it ll be corrected next time and went away. He didn't even offer to change to diff food or not to charge anything.   My friend had chicken biryani, and we couldn't explain how you can open a restaurant this bad. We just paid the bill and moved out.   I am sorry to say, but I don't see this restaurant survive for another month with this kind of service.   I would never ever come back to this restaurant and I could still feel the sour taste even after a week. IF YOUR EVER THOUGHT ABOUT VISITING, FORGET IT.  Note : Don't build fake reviews just for the sake of luring customers."}
{"text":"My Greatgrandparents  were from India,so I grew up with this type of cuisine, and I must say,, this food is Exceptional! My delicate palate was treated to a whirlwind of taste, spices and flavor Boy am I glad I decided to give this fairly new spot a try, I have tried all the Indian Restaurants in Tempe and Scottsdale and a few in Phoenix, this is THE BEST food ever. Attentive and Friendly Staff, I had the chicken Tika Masala, was better than ZAM ZAM in central phoneix, , they held the title for the last few years, the basmati rice was perfect,each rice grain separate and perfectly cooked,the dahl ( curried Lentil ) amazing and flavorful This will be my go to from now, on for Chicken Tika Masala.... I was introduced to the chef, who is a 5 star restaurant chef from Hyderabad. The Price on right on target, perfect location with a light rail stop, right there. There will be lines out the door,once this place is discovered by the ASU faculty and students YUM!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   The food wasn't good at all.  We ordered the  1. Samosas - the flavour was bland and they served it on a bed of mad wilted lettuce.  2. The Dum Pukht Biryani with Lame - only reason im giving this review 2 stars. It was really good but lacked any sort of real spice.  3. The Chicken Tikka Masala - I'm pretty sure the waiter gave us butter chicken. It was okay. Barely any spice.  4. The Naan - Dry and too thin so it wasnt even edible.  Our bill came to 40ishs.  Such a waste of money on my end."}
{"text":"So i saw the many bad reviews, and i live near the place, and have seen it to be super empty many times. BUT i still wanted to try the biryani...because iam from south india, and i cant find decent south indian Hyderabadi dum biryani around here! And  i was pretty surprised at the quality of the chicken biryani. It was actually pretty good, maybe too bony, but thats how sometimes good biryani is, they make you earn the taste!. And i havent liked a biryani around the valley in like 9 yrs here. Its pretty authentic, the taste flavor and i love the fact that he toned down the spice on my request!  Also it isnt crazy expensive. You see when you visit this place it would help to become a bit more indian, in the sense that this is probably run by the older gentleman who makes great biryani but isnt accostomed to treating and organizing a large group of people for a business. But of course he was pretty nice to me! So yeah, if you want good actual dum biryani tasting like home  cooked by a bhai, I request you go past the service (if it was bad) and give a shot to the food. I will be checking out their other biryanis soon!!  PS: To clarify, no this is not a fake review for the business. I am not connected to the person running the business, and yes i have tasted only one of their dishes, so i will be sure to update the review when i see their other dishes too!"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery unless you want to wait 2 hours and get lukewarm food!  I ordered online and it took 2+ hours to deliver my food.  After calling the restaurant 3 times and them *insisting* that the food was delivered, on the 4th call to the restaurant did they finally acknowledge that the food had not, in fact, been delivered and the driver was waiting in the hotel lobby downstairs.  I am staying in a hotel less than a 5 minute drive from them and it took over 2 hours to get food to me?!?!  Lukewarm food is pretty bad, but what is worse is half of the appetizers I ordered were undercooked and doughy.  How does this place stay in business??"}
{"text":"The chicken biryani was really bland, the rice was soggy and the chicken was mostly bones and the little meat that was there was over-cooked."}
{"text":"We had veg biryani(okay)  panner pakora (awesome) rasmalai and moong daal halwa (best) it was really good ... No artificial flavours ... Very good Indian place in Tempe after a long time ...we were greeted by an elderly gentleman who was very sweet and took care of our order in timely fashion"}
{"text":"Well, there was lots of food, but nothing jumped out as particularly exciting. Perhaps that's just buffets for you!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place only once on a Friday evening. We were a group of four. There must have only been 3 other groups in the restaurant.  I went in with lots of hope, as Biryani is one of my favorite indian dishes.            We started with the tandoori chicken as starter. The presentation was good and the dish was delicious. I then ordered the lamb biryani. It took way too long to get to us, considering the restaurant was almost empty.  The presentation was on par with what i expected for a biryani. But then it all fell apart. The meat was tough and not seasoned at all. I could have sworn it was just added before bringing it out.The rice was too spicy. And then it got worse. I found grapes (not a raisin, that would be normal) and green pepper in the dish. Never mind that these 2 dont belong in a biryani, they dont belong together in any dish.  If the \"Biryani House\" cant even do biryani right, i wouldnt bother with any other dish.    On the plus side the service was good, but i think that might have been due to the absence of crowds. Not gonna visit this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, great venue space, and phenomenal service, will definitely come here again !"}
{"text":"Best place to eat Indian food, it was my first time trying that type of food they give me  what the waiter said it's the bestseller I forgot the name but it taste it's very good  and it's reasonable prices great place I recommend... to everyone"}
{"text":"It was Saturday night and I was feeling brave.. next thing I picked up the phone and placed my order with Biriyani house. This restaurant has a lot of one-star reviews to say the least and other five star reviews.I was very confused with what to expect but I had to give it a shot.  It's located at a strip mall on East Apache blvd very close to ASU and a bunch of other popular Indian restaurants, they definitely have to put their act together if they want to survive here.  The restaurant was completely empty when we walked in, my order was ready there was only one person who was at the counter he was also taking orders on call. ~Chicken Biriyani $8.99 ~Dum ka Chicken $9.99  The Biriyani is hands down a one-star dish, the rice had no flavour and the chicken was overdone to the point of being chewy.It seemed like the biriyani was not fresh and was a mix of biriyani and just plain basmati rice but the Mirchi ka salan and raita were surprisingly good (straight out of a restaurant in India).  The saving grace was the chicken dish, aromatic and full of flavour.The portions are fine and the prices are very competitive.I'm definitely excited to try the other curries on their menu. However one very bad and another exceptional dish later I have a feeling that they are not quite ready and are still in a trial phase.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really don't know whether the five star reviews are credible or not, but I being a fan of Indian cuisine was definite to try out a new spot in the valley, but......... A total rip off, waste of money and time.  I ordered four chicken biryani for go to, and was so enthusiastic while having it on my table, but what I got was, three plain rice with not even a tiny piece of chicken, and only one biryani with one piece of chicken. No salad or sauce accompanied as sides, man how am I supposed to eat your plain flat rice??? Is this your chicken biryani? Where is the chicken? Well, for biryani I know very authentic places, see my other reviews.... I really don't mean to discourage a new business but please don't fool the people by your name, either it should be called anything else but a \" Biryani House \", or for the sake of name, please improve your so called biryani. If it's a biryani house, it should sell the best biryani in town.  I also have reservations for the portion size, the quantities are not sufficient for an order. Writing about service will make it too much, but seriously, the service sucks. I ordered way before getting In there, but when I went to pick up, they took another 20 mins to complete. The guy was in a clutter, was running in and out and asking questions again n again and wasn't sure about anything. I guess they are not ready to open the business yet."}
{"text":"I accidentally discovered this place yesterday, my plan was to have a late lunch at Tasty Kabob which is next door to this very new restaurant.  Tasty Kabob is closed on Mondays, I had no idea so I decided to have lunch here instead.    I ended up leaving and having my lunch at Curry Corner up the street for the following reason.   The gent working was highly professional and very friendly.  I ordered Samosa as appetizer and Haleem (goat) as my main dish.  The gent presented a hand-written menu on a piece of paper with no prices which I though was very strange.  Why would you officially open a restaurant if you haven't even printed menus??? Very strange...  So my main dish arrives while I'm still eating the Samosa.  I've had Haleem at many Indian and Pakistani restaurant but had never ever seen a PINK colored Haleem in my life! I tasted it and smelled something strange, almost like burned plastic! And, the worse part, the gent brings me PITA bread!!! I couldn't believe it! This is a South Asian joint so why the heck are you serving me pita, that's Mediterranean/Arab/Mid Eastern! I wanted fresh Naan from the brick clay oven! When I pointed this out, the gent apologized and said sorry no Naan yet!!! Again, why did you even open this place when you're not ready??? And, he was allegedly working on preparing a \"big order for 200 people\"! Yeah alright! And serve the pita instead of Naan???  I politely declined to eat, was very angry but didn't express my anger, and offered to pay so I could get the hell out and find a real place.  He refused to take my none but I still left $2 for the bottle of water on the table.  Avoid this place at least until they are fully prepared and truly open, don't be fooled by the 'Grand Opening' sign! And, DO NOT order the Goat Haleem you will regret it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best biryani I had in Phoenix. I am here in Phoenix from the past three years and I took biryani from most of the Indian restaurants in here but this is the best place by far.   The people here are really courteous and welcoming. A great place to party and eat.  I got biryani, chicken 65 and veg biryani here. All these taste really good. Mirchi ka salaan is the best I ever had in US.   All in all, if you want the best food, this is a great place to stop by."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the city.  Their chicken tikka masala can't be beat.  Likewise with the lamb shank."}
{"text":"I visited this place again today and oh such a disaster! When we entered there was no one at the front of the house. After calling them they confirmed that they were open. The elderly uncle who serves here was eating. He gave us water without washing his hands?!!  Unfortunately that was not even the worst part. He suggested us to order the chicken tikka kebabs. They were horrible. I am pretty sure they were at least a day old. The chutney that they served with it looked as if it was kept open since a long time as it had dried up!!! The plate was really shabby. We asked him if they were stale to which he said no. The biryani was fine. But somehow we had lost our appetite after the first bite of the tikka. I am pretty sure they had microwaved an old batch. While we were there two more people came to eat and left after waiting to get seated. When we complained about the food he just said the oven takes a long time to heat up and they had a catering order. Well I don't care. It's so unfair for people to get such a service for their money.   The saddest part is he didn't seem bothered at all. It's was almost like he didn't care about the restaurant or his customers. I have vowed NEVER to go back here. It has been THE worst experience I have had in a restaurant. It was really disappointing after our first experience here. I take back my words..Save yourself a nightmare and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews, this is the best indian food i've had! I dont have their buffet so maybe that's it, but from their menu everything i've tried i've enjoyed. I go here about once a month so i guess that makes me a regular.  Butter chicken is phenomenal and the naan is always fresh. Samosas was good (a bit much on the breading).  All the lamb dishes have been delicious, and they've got a nice vegetarian menu. Cheap beers if that's your thing.  Waiters are very helpful if you're not sure what to order, service has been consistent and the interior is very nicely decorated.  Big windows are good to people-watch while you eat."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is HORRENDOUS.  We were there on a Friday night and imagine that, the place was completely empty.  We had a female server who too forever to take our orders, and then promptly forgot about it. About 15 minutes later, with no lassi or appetizer on our table, a male server came up to us and gave us the menu....we told him we already ordered and he looked confused. 20 minutes later, our appetizer (chat) came. It was good. another 10 minutes later, our \"chicken\" vindaloo came, and it turned out to be beef. We didnt complain. We did, however, after another 5 minutes, asked what happened to our sweet lassi and mango lassi and our saag paneer. 10 minutes later, the mango lassi came. another five minutes, came the saag paneer. We again asked for the sweet lassi and it finally came. We also asked for water from the start and that never came.  After finishing our meal, we waited approximately 10 minutes hoping to see our server, who disappeared. I finally waved down the female server who looked at me, and then walked away and never came back. I had to go to the bar to pay.   What would have been an enjoyable meal was completely marred by the service, or lack thereof. I think there are way to many better indian restaurants to put myself through the torture again."}
{"text":"How can I say no to $11.99 Indian buffet? That's right, I can't. And neither should you, especially at Biryani House.  I've passed by this restaurant millions of times and never gave it a chance, until the prospect of lunch buffet lured me in. I have never seen such a huge assortment of fresh, delicious Indian dishes in my life.  Biryani House is in a strange building that looks like it should have doctor's offices in it instead of an Indian restaurant, but once you head up the stairs into the real restaurant area, the place is actually quite nice. The decor is typical of Indian buffets, with lush carpets and linen tablecloths, but it's warm and cozy with huge windows that let you see all the action across the street at Wellesley Station.  And the lunch buffet is probably the best I've ever had. They had everything -- Chana Masala, Zucchini Masala, Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Beef and Goat curry and many more, as well as heaping trays of basmati rice and delicious freshly-baked naan.  The majority of the dishes were vegetarian, and delicious at that.  I checked out their normal menu which seemed average, with most dishes in the $9-$18 range. The seafood dishes are the pricier ones, so if you stick to basic vegetarian dishes your bill will be substantially cheaper. They also deliver if you spend $35, but to a very limited area so that will be no help to me in the cold winter when all you want is Indian to warm your belly.  But I definitely recommend trying the lunch buffet -- it wasn't too busy inside (lots of room to hog the buffet), the food kept coming out fresh every couple of minutes, and for $11.99, you'll be full for the whole day. Mmm. I love this Indian buffet!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken biryani I've had since being in Hyderabad. The service is a little lacking compared to the food, but the food came out quickly and overall this is still an easy 5 stars. I will also say some background music would be nice, when I went the restaurant was dead quiet."}
{"text":"For biryani I recommend pastries n chaat. Got the boneless chicken biriyani recently. All they did was rip chicken meat off of the bones and place it in there. If you are out of the proper kind of meat then say it. DO NOT CHEAT YOU CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"egads - what to do?  I recently came here with a friend and we seemed to enjoy one of the nicer Indian buffet places in Toronto.  Food and variety was pretty good.  Labels were well displayed.  Service was particularly good b/c the customer:server ratio was particularly in our favour.  This ended up meaning fresh naan served right to our table, and regular refreshing of our glasses of cold water.  However, and this is the biggest However in all of my Yelp experience thus far... my friend had a WILDLY BAD BOUT of FOOD POISONING.    I did not have any of the Tandoori chicken, but decided to wing one piece home for my dog.  He thoroughly enjoyed it... but, not unlike my friend, he was \"off\" the next day and resisted his two regular daily meals.  Also, the first thing that he did when he went outside to pee, was eat grass (something that animals instinctively do when their stomach is upset and s/he might feel like vomitting).   Argh!  This is one of my fave Indian buffet spots (the other being Dharma on King st.)... but the fact that my friend became SO VIOLENTLY ILL has now put a different spin on this place.  Gad, I don't want this place to shut down or anything - but geez, I don't want to become sick after having a meal here.  My friend had to take sick leave off work, and is still not 100% 48 hours later.    Online I looked up ways to deal with Food Poisoning, and one site suggested a visit to the doctor's to document/prove the association with the restaurant AND to make a phone call to Health Canada(?) to make them aware of the situation.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"You can report any concerns about restaurant food to your local inspection authority.
