We went there one day before they close for summer. Either many dishes are not available or the chef/owner was too lazy to make them.

Given that there are so many Szechuan restaurants in the area, I don't think this one can survive since we have so many choices here. The owner can do better but does not try hard enough."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant!! Try the food and you won't be disappointed!! I ordered la zi ji ding which was basically spicy chicken and it turned out it was super tasty!!!"}
{"text":"this place deserved recognition for it having stinky tofu in the phoenix area. i also think the food here is notches above the other chinese restaurants in the area. if you get a chance, you should definitely drop by!"}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty accurate: good food, odd/friendly service....let me explain. So, I Ordered the ma po tofu, beef and broccoli, chow mein, and an eggplant with garlic sauce dish. 3 out of the four dishes were pretty good; eggplant being my favorite. Perhaps the tofu dish is an acquired taste (and I generally like tofu) and I also felt the chow mein was rather bland. On to the service. It was a one man show who took my ordered and cooked my meal. He was kind and friendly, though spoke almost no English. I had to use google translate to communicate, which is not a big deal, but this seems like a potential barrier to the business. Happened upon Chili Rush by accident, but was pleasantly surprised overall."}
{"text":"I went to here few times, this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in the town! A very great place to stay with family. The favor here is different to other restaurants and the price is cheaper."}
{"text":"they are have asian food and chinese style food?A lot of your order very nice service?delicious food?they are kindness. worth it."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place. The food worths five stars but I would give zero star for the service. We sat there for 1.5 hours before our food was served, watching other people who arrived later than us got served and finished their dinner. There was only one waitress and she seemed either too busy or did not care about us. I mean, if your customers are sitting there for more than one hour without food, at least you should serve some water and explain a little bit. I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but seriously, they need to hire some people to run this business."}
{"text":"Really nice place to have dinner! Definitely I love the fish here, so fresh and yamy!  
If you don't like spicy things, try the chicken soup and crispy pork ribs there! Trust me! You will like these as me."}
{"text":"Chili Rush is absolutely fantastic. Every time I come I leave very satisfied and I am yet to have something I didn't enjoy. It is always a treat to come here for lunch! The staff is very nice and attentive and the food is delicious. I always look forward to eating here. 

If you are reading this review and have not stopped in, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It took forever to place our order. The girl took my phone away cause she didn't even know her menu. I really didn't like that it took forever to get our drinks or place our order. The food was ok, but they lack on customer service. They really need to improve their system or will be out of business soon. I would not recommend this place not just because of the service but their food is not even that good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Restaurant in Arizona! Come to try! ???????????????????????????Best Chinese Restaurant in Arizona! Come to try! ???????????????????????????Best Chinese Restaurant in Arizona! Come to try! ????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"It is the same old spot as the Henry's private kitchen. And I think it's the same owner. Although food style changed from the Taiwanese to more spicy (Hunan / Sichuan) style. Other than the menu changes, everything stay the same.

It's my favorite Chinese restaurant in AZ! Plus it's close to where I work. I have invited friends from China to try this place, and everybody loves it!"}
{"text":"With a name like Chili Rush I was anticipating a spicy meal! I came here for lunch to get an order to-go. For the go-to orders I didn't see any option for lunch specials but they might offer them for dine in. There is a $10 minimum to use credit cards so I decided to get two items and eat the rest as leftovers for dinner. After browsing through the menu I originally wanted to try a loofah dish since I've never had it before but they did not have it available unfortunately?. I ended up with the ma po tofu and the water boiled fish. They were ready in a few short minutes and well packaged. It was a huge amount of food too!

The food quality itself was about average. The portions were very generous but the flavors in both the ma po tofu and water boiled fish were not as well developed as other Sichuan restaurants here such as Chengdu. Both dishes did have the requisite Sichuan peppercorn in it providing the tongue numbing sensation that follows after eating it, but the spice level itself was more on the mild side.

Service was friendly but it helps to know Mandarin Chinese here as the woman behind the counter (Perhaps the co-owner?) had a pretty heavy accent.

If I'm in the area I might come here again to try some different dishes but I probably wouldn't order the same ones I got from this restaurant again.

P.S. This might be the only place in the Phoenix area that offers that odoriferous delicacy stinky tofu for those that want to indulge!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place yesterday on a whim (I was craving good Chinese food and wanted to try a new place). It's really tucked away so it's hard to spot from the street. 

The decor when you walk in is beautiful. The seats almost feel like you're sitting outside in a private patio setting. It took a minute to be seated but later on I found out why: The place was ran by one man. The same man that seated me also took my order, cooked my meal and was my cashier. I don't know if this is how they normally operate, but it's too minimal for a business. He had really broken English as well, which makes it incredibly hard to communicate when ordering or asking for something you need. 

The food itself was good. The eggplant was very tasty and the noodles were just okay. I'd probably never order the noodles again, but they have a LOT of options. The food also seems authentic too. 

I would come back, but I'd be inclined to bring somebody that speaks Chinese the next time around to translate and to make suggestions."}
{"text":"We saw the name of this place, and thought \"Hey, this might be a nice place to get some spicy food\", because we have big hopes and bigger dreams. We stopped by a little after 6:30pm on a Thursday evening, and there was only one other table seated. We were sat, and the waitress promptly moved to replace our chopstick/bowl setup with a plate and fork. When I told her that we're perfectly fine using the chopsticks, she expressed amazement, then presented the menu, advising us in cautious terms that one side was authentic and the other side was American-style. I appreciate her looking out, but (if you've read my other reviews) you know by now that I've just gotten used to this sort of treatment. Even in 2018, people are amazed that white people know how to use chopsticks and enjoy spicy food. But whatever.

Anyhow, we ordered the special fried beef, frog leg dry hotpot, popcorn chicken, and deep fried pork intestine. I took a picture of everything, and everything was absolutely delicious. You should bring one of your white friends here, order the deep fried pork intestine in Mandarin, and tell your friend that it's just fried pork and smile when they declare that it's their favorite new thing. Then they get extra hipster points for eating offal. It's win-win!!!

The popcorn chicken is made with small, bite-sized pieces of delicately breaded chicken (I want to say thigh, and pieces of breast?) seasoned with salt and pepper and accompanied by small leaves of fried basil. Honestly, I could have just buried my face in the plate and inhaled the entire dish. It was amazing, and it is absolutely something which you should try. The deep fried pork intestine was really something special. Intestine is one of those things that can really go either way- I've had it steamed or boiled and it still just had an earthy, poopiness to it that I couldn't fuck wit. But this was filled with some sort of herb (I want to say either cilantro or basil) and then deep-fried, so that there was a blissfully light crisp on the outside and a delicate, buttery interior ring. There was a really delicious thick brown sauce for dipping, and a nice garnish of pickled cabbage and carrot. Honestly, this is something that you can order to help a friend get over any fear of offal. They'll love it. Maybe. And if not, then fuck 'em- more for you! The house special fried beef was delicious- fairly simple, stir-fried with jalapenos, chilis, and cilantro. It was really nice, with a little bit of heat. My girlfriend had the frog leg dry hotpot. She ordered it extra extra spicy and they definitely put a little more spice in it than there was in mine, but it was still really accessible. The frog legs were small, bite-sized pieces cooked with onions, chilis, and peppers. The dry hot pot was exactly that- a dry hot pot dish. All in all, everything was absolutely delicious, and once our server got over her amazement she was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had here in Arizona. It was so good. We had a group so we ordered a huge variety. The steamed chili fish was great, eggs and tomatoes. I loved their green beans!  It was all so good. Recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"You might want to read this in its entirety before visiting this restaurant.  Entered the Chili Rush restaurant on a Sunday evening, there was an odd smell upon entering the restaurant.  There were no customers except me.  I sat at a bench seat, and the seats were very comfortable, although not professionally upholstered.  My server seemed anxious to serve me.  She asked me if I wanted something to drink and I said water with lemon.  In turn, she had trouble getting me ice water with lemon, as she brought water to the table initially in only a partially filled glass, when I requested lemon again, she seemed to have quite a bit of trouble producing a glass of ice water with lemon in it.  There was no background music playing, and the daily specials board was written in all Chinese. I placed my order from the menu for which there was a picture of what I was ordering, number 79, accompanied by spring rolls.  They (there were two women serving my table) brought me a large bowl of white rice before anything else arrived.  A short while later they brought out my spring rolls. I ate them, they tasted fine, but I noticed that the glasses in the rack above the front counter had not been recently dusted.  There was a television mounted near the ceiling of the front counter but it was not on. My meal arrived, and I looked at it and there was a dark brown boiled egg on the plate wrapped inside of boiled leafy greens and some type of meat atop the mound of white rice, and the curry chicken did not look appetizing with an opaque fluorescent color in the sauce.  It did not look anything like the picture on the menu, so I asked them to get the menu so that I could show them what the picture of the meal should look like and then what it did look like.  I asked them to send it back to the kitchen, seconds after entering the kitchen showing the chef the meal that I was refusing, they returned to my table and said this was how they were preparing this meal, and refused to make me a new one.  I said to them that I wished to have the meal that I ordered on the menu redone, and have it look the way pictured on the menu.  I refused to eat it and I told her that I would like to settle my check for the spring rolls that I had already ordered and eaten, which she then told there would be no charge, and I left the restaurant. I do not recommend that anyone try this restaurant until this business revise their business operations to efficiently and effectively create delicious meal selections for their customers."}
