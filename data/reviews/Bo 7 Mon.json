{"text":"I just finished eating dinner here after reading some of the reviews below. I was craving my mom's \"Bo nhung dem\" so I went for it. I've never written a review before but felt the need to make the (enormous) effort to actually log on and write this review, out of justice to this place!  The \"Bo 7 Mon\" (their signature dish) is NOT a rip-off. It's a pretty darn good deal! We took two courses home because we couldn't finish it.   Let's be clear here... Its $27.00 FOR 7 COURSES! It's portioned for 2 PEOPLE! That's $13.50 per person for 7 courses! (That's like the price of a Big Mac meal!) Who in their right mind would think you could pay $27 and get 17 pieces each course in a sit down restaurant?! PSA You're very obviously not going to get 17 pieces of beef each course. I don't know how to stress this enough.  For transparency, here's what you get for $27.00 (portioned for 2 people). It comes with rice paper, fresh herbs, vermicelli and a delicious mam nem dipping sauce (almost as good as my mom's haha) for you to wrap all the deliciousness in. - Bo nhung dam (1 round, about 7/8 slices of meat) - Bo la lot (2 pieces) - Bo mo chay (2 pieces) - Bo sate (2 pieces) - Bo luc lac (small plate) - Bo tai chanh (small plate) - Chao bo (2 small bowls)  Service was prompt and friendly. Food came out quickly. The place was clean. I'd definitely recommend this place.   If you're hoping to pay $27 and get 7 courses of 17 pieces of beef/sausage or whatever for each course, do not eat here! Perhaps try an AYCE place instead."}
{"text":"Food is ok here. There was a fly in my girlfriend's pho and they didn't really care. Yeah..not coming back"}
{"text":"Service is great and their diced steak is sooo good. Cooked well yet still soft and the waitress is super nice ask for Jenny. :)"}
{"text":"It's their grand opening - so we are excited to try this place. Option C1 - signature dish beef 7 ways (actually the name of this restaurant) is a rip off.  It tastes well enough but the photo shows much more food than you actually get.   The photo shows 3 plates of sausages with 17 pieces.     All you actually get is 6 sausages the size of your thumb.   This is the of bait and switch routine.  Not a good way to attract new customers.  Save your money & go next door to Pho Dau  Bo."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was great. :) I would definitely recommend this to my friends and also bring family here. :)"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is tasty! Fresh spring rolls are great. Pho is really good.   The waitress who works almost every day is amazing and most of the other staff is really good too.  It's a great clean place with good service mostly run by family members. We always come here and it's by far the best pho place serving most of Vaughan and North York."}
{"text":"I just went here and got the pho, it was really good. Definitely recommend this place if you ever want pho."}
