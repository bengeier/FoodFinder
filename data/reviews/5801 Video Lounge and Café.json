{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars, but you still have to walk through the cigarettes to get in and out of the place, like it's 2006. Big negative.

BUT this is my favorite gay bar in the city. You can relax on the deck on a sunny afternoon or you can party it up there in the crowd on Saturday night. Very versatile, depending on the time and day you go.

The renovations that this place has gone through in the past years are awesome. Bartenders are friendly. And the food is AMAZING. I'm serious. And cheap."}
{"text":"VERY BAD SERVICE!!!!!
After the waiter brought me my drink he never came back. He just disappeared and none of the other waiters came to the table. No one ever came back to take my order. So after waiting about 25 minutes I just got up and left. 

I can't speak but the food because I never got to taste any. 

The best tip I can give is eat before you come here."}
{"text":"The best deck in the burgh, for the gay bars anyway. Great bar though, the food has gotten better recently, and the drinks are always good. Its a good time, and a good place to hang out in the community. Very friendly staff and ownership. Who also really supports the community."}
{"text":"I went to 5801 for a student professional organization meeting after party, and it was the most productive evening of my grad school life. First, our server, Mahogany, could not have been more patient with a group of 10-15 who showed up on a Long Island Iced Tea night ($3.50 a pop every Thursday on the daily drink special rotation), wanted separate checks and a million appetizers, and lingered until close. I'm sure we were very annoying, and service did slow a bit as happy hour picked up, but overall, it was great. All of the appetizers range between $3 to $5, and while they are slightly-above-average bar fare kinds of dishes (sweet potato fries, red pepper hummus, mac & cheese wedges, etc.), they were all very satisfying and well portioned for the price. We happened to be there in fair weather and stuck to a corner of the patio, and it felt like we had our own private area. I'd definitely go for happy hour and snacks again."}
{"text":"I always have fun when I go here. The drinks are good and people will openly come up to you and dance and say \"hi.\" It's dominated by men mostly, but if you just want to meet friends or you're a guy looking to meet another guy, this place is perfect. 

It might not be a New York bar or whatever, but this isn't New York last I noticed. The guys here are well-dressed and the bar is classy.

It's always pretty packed on the patio out back, and they play up-to-date music and remixes.

The only negative thing is I can say that one of their male bartenders hit on my one night, even though he knew I was with my fiancee (who's a girl btw). I went to buy a glass of wine and ref-fill my fiancee's drink, and he kept asking me questions and was really blatantly flirting and it was awkward...he told me that I was cute and he wouldn't let me pay for my own drink! That was the only time I went to that particular bartender that night, after that I stuck to the bartender on the patio and everything was fine.

Overall though, really fun bar. Never went and had a bad time. It's classy and although not filled with an equal ratio of men to women, it's really easy to meet people."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh to visit family for Christmas and found this gem. It was in a cute little area of town.  We were greeted warmly on arrival by a very nice woman named Alexis (i believe) who gave us all the information we needed about the bar (where the smoking and non smoking areas were, where the bathrooms were located,  the dart area, outdoor bar, etc).  The bar is much larger than it looks from the outside.  It was nicely decorated for Christmas.  Our waiter was super friendly and checked on us often.  Better service than we've received at most restaurants.  We had already eaten dinner but it had been a few hours so we decided to order a few appetizers (garlic knots and zucchini planks), both were really good. As were the drinks.  A video DJ started around 10 and the music was good and has us dancing in our seats and out.  Lol. Wish we had a bar like this in our hometown.  I would highly recommend.."}
{"text":"The nicest gay bar in Pittsburgh. Very nice bartenders, Arthur, Brett, Larry, Nick, Cole, Jonas, Travis, Will and Bill are great! The back patio is beautiful!  The food is awesome! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Omg this bar is fantastic!  The throwback 90s music mixed with a few cocktails made me want to stay there all night. The bar is very clean and trendy. They have a great outdoor back patio space, but it was too cold the night we came here. I will absolutely come back again in warmer weather."}
{"text":"Nice deck, but not all that cheap.  Also, I'd prefer a dj to the music videos (but the screens are needed for tv show/movie nights and football season, I understand).  This used to be New York New York, so it's nice to see that the establishment is still around and it's nice to run in to some familiar faces (from Pegasus, True, etc.).  I don't know if it's the same owners or not...I don't really care.  The food is good and I've met some fun people there :)"}
{"text":"Follows the general equation: 

Pop Music + Videos + Cocktail Drink Specials = Gay Bar

Pretty typical.  

Patio is probably super rad in the not-winter months.

Quote of the evening, \"Aaaah 5801, where you're guaranteed to get a complete reading of the canon of Rihanna every Friday night.\"  

Almost religious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at 5801 yesterday! I love the atmosphere and look of the place. It's very chill at least when I went around 7 pm. We ventured to other bars in the area and as it got later it looked like the place started to get busier! At the time I went, there was some music but no dancing yet, and the pens game was on which could have been why dancing wasn't happening yet. It was a nice place to start the night with some appetizers and drinks! Our waiter/bartender Andrew was awesome! He was so sweet, friendly, and funny! I definitely recommend anyone to try out 5801 bar!"}
{"text":"The \"best\" gay bar in Pittsburgh with the weakest drinks. They use those electronic pour systems and it's terrible. $40 bucks should give you at least a little buzz. Stick to beer if you're coming here!

The good thing about it is it's usually packed on Friday and Saturday. 

I do think it's more of a place for friends than hooking up. No where to dance either. The top area while non smoking, could be better laid out and made into a dance floor which Pittsburgh desperately needs!"}
{"text":"Not bad hate the smoking, but upstairs is non smoking just no one in it. Spin and this bar seems to be the friendliest and more updated (clean) for their gay scene."}
{"text":"I visited in January and thought this place was great! Everyone was really friendly, yeah drinks were poured with care, but still... i got buzzed! I really really reccomend this place... seemed like the least trashiest place (and it was) at the time! Parking was a little rough but besides that i had a ball. AND SMOKING ON A DECK big plus. I hate smoking outside a door."}
{"text":"Awesome bar - one of my favs in the mid-west. I always stop by when I'm passing through Pittsburgh... nice mixture of soaked locals and curious travelers. Great location - average drinks."}
{"text":"This is the gay man's gay bar in Pittsburgh. With a large space, fully equipped with 3 separate bars (1 on a fairly newly reconstructed outdoor porch venue), dart boards, and a small dance floor, it meets the needs of almost anybody who stops in for a good time. 5801 has a poker night, darts league, and is just a place for the gays to feel comfortable and have a good time at. I would say that this is the gay bar with the most diverse crowd in Pittsburgh- gay mens, lesbians, straight men and women, etc. Smokers enjoy the downstairs bar, while upstairs is non-smoking. Pretty good music, good daily specials and pretty nice bartenders- this is not a bad way to spend a night out."}
{"text":"Still have smoking! It's 2018! Drinks way way way overpriced! $11.25 for a vodka and redbull!!!! Who are they kidding. Staff were not great. Forgetful and overcharged us. Food was decent. No need to come here for lgbtq. Go to any bar for cheaper drinks and better service."}
{"text":"Best gay bar in Pittsburgh - but all are welcome. Just wish they would change up the weekly specials and not have 80s on every Thursday. Oh and they need to go 100% smoke-free!! Get with it, Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Cool music, great food, weak but tasty drinks.
Mostly older cis & gay male patrons, though it's not really a hook-up spot anyway so not sure if that matters. Overall, \"relaxed\" comes to mind. I really dig the \"video lounge\" idea and the patio during the summer is gorgeous. (No more lonely smoking!) I would say come here if you want to have a conversation with your friends, for a beer after work, or to pregame your night out.
There is a downstairs bar, an upstairs bar, and a patio bar. There are booths, bar stools, hightop tables, and standing room. I always get a little nervous around the combination of drinking and darts, though."}
{"text":"So, I've been going to 5801 since I turned 21, but in the past 2 years, I've probably only frequented the joint 3 times. It has changed (aesthetically) quite a bit recently, and the newest addition in the upstairs / patio area is gorgeous. It has a new, lodge type feel, which I'm all about. 

Unfortunately, nothing has been done to vent the smells. It's the only bar that I still reek of cigarettes and regret when I leave and my clothes (really annoying with your coats in the winter) forever hold the smell until washed well. This alone almost always makes me not want to go there, but I think it has become a very comfortable, \"everyday\" bar for the lgbt crowd, and I find that even a lot of non-lgbt people don't mind the atmosphere as well.

Stick with beer here, too. I don't mind the mixed drinks, but I've never been a big fan. They seem to use cheap mixers (especially sours) and I often do not enjoy the drinks as much as other places ---- but they are usually affordable and larger, so I guess it's a trade off."}
{"text":"Always a nice mixed crowd. The patio is fantastic. Great friendly staff. I only regret I can't get there more often."}
{"text":"What to say about 5801.

This establishment is frequented by myself quite often, clearly it has a certain appeal and or undertow that endlessly sucks you back in.

Your night of choice will completely change the atmosphere.  Weekends are a meat market of suffocating closeness, yet fun, friends and whatever else your heart can desire.

Weeknights... Wednesdays are poker, starting at 8.  Anyone can play! Free! Prizes! 

Special daily... 6-8, buy one 'chips & dips / the classics' and get one free!  SWEET.

Food is pretty good.

Sample some sweet potato fries... slurp

Be nice and you will be rewarded in heaven."}
{"text":"The thing about 5801 that originally drew me in, and had me come back more than once, was the funnel cake fries. Funnel cake in the form of easy to eat \"fries.\" The only think they're missing is chocolate sauce, but I continue to order them with just the powdered sugar and I am always happy.

The other reason I keep coming back to 5801 is the happy hour. 6-8pm with buy one, get one free classic appetizers. I personally love funnel cake fries (duh), zucchini planks, mac and cheese wedges, any type of fries, and the pretzel sticks. And even with that extensive list, they have at least 5 more options that make the cut for the buy one get one list. 

The 90s music that is always playing on all the TVs is pretty awesome, and the device is consistently good. I recommend sitting on the patio if possible."}
{"text":"Would be nice if the girl at outside bar would have taken our order instead of gabbing with friends.  Had one beer and left.  Maybe she needs to be work at a lesbian bar instead.  June 15th at 430 pm"}
{"text":"This was the biggest and busiest of the bars as guided by my Pittsburgian guardian angel Derek (he really was angelic), and seemed to be the best people watching as well.  Very nice porch out back, a bit crowded but with many of the right people, almost felt like a little slice of Chicago but with nicer people that would talk to you even though they are twink-lie.  Seemed like the place to be on a Friday...too bad the drink were slightly weak but they kept flowing."}
{"text":"Friendly and intimate bar, well designed with restaurant downstairs and a couple of bars upstairs. Nice crowd, I was there during a football match and was pretty busy. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best gay bar in this little town of Pittsburgh, by far!"}
{"text":"RUINED MY SATURDAY NIGHT

This bar labels itself as a Gay bar and it really does not have Gay patrons.

I visited the 5801 Video Lounge on Saturday, August 31, 2013 during Labor Day weekend.  80% of the bar's patrons were straight - heterosexual couples.  There were a few Gay people scattered throughout the bar but in no way would I call this place a Gay bar.

The place looks good but not all that special.  It kind of reminded me of Applebee's for some reason. It could use a good cleaning. The carpets for example were dirty and even sticky in some places.

At the upstairs bar, for 20 minutes, I tried unsuccessfully to get a drink from any of the bartenders there. They were ignoring me. It was as if they were avoiding myself and my partner.

We don't smoke and really were trying to avoid the downstairs bar because they allow smoking but since we were being ignored by the bartenders upstairs who were too busy serving the straight couples we reluctantly went to the downstairs bar to try and get drinks.

At the smoky downstairs bar, the bartender did approach me but when I asked for Black Velvet, they didn't have it. So then, I asked for Canadian Club and again they did not have it.  I really felt as though this bar did not want us there and weren't going to serve us.  Black Velvet and Canadian Club are both fine Canadian whiskeys that are staples at almost all bars and I found it unbelievable that they did not have both of them.

The bartenders ignored us or told us no. I never want to walk into an establishment and hear the word \"no\".  They should always say \"yes\" and that did not happen for us.

I also observed the bartenders using those automatic shot measuring devices.  I absolutely hate that.  How do I know I am even getting a full shot of booze with those things.  If they need to measure, I want to see them use a shot glass so I can see what I am paying for.  Anyway, after seeing the automatic shot measuring devices, I was pretty sure the drinks were very weak.

There is a patio on the backside. It is not a beautiful patio as described by some of the reviewers.  When I was there, it was jam-packed with smokers and there was standing-room only.

The patrons were not friendly in 5801 either. AND, worst of all, because of inaccurate reviews on Yelp, Urban Spoon and Gay Cities, I ended up visiting this bar and wasting my valuable vacation time on a Saturday night when I could have gone somewhere else.

There is no dance floor. Other reviewers mention that there is a dance floor. I could not find one anywhere. Perhaps, it used to be located where the dart boards are now.

I was ignored by the upstairs bartenders.  The drinks they do make are weak.  I was unable to get my drink in this bar.  The bartenders and the patrons were unfriendly. It is not a Gay bar.  I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and her Gay friends when she was in grad school. Very good drinks and in the summer, the bar outback is a great addition. As a straight guy hanging out in a Gay bar, I felt sorta weird, but the crowd was incredibly respectful and made it very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Favorite Bar in Pittsburgh....it's where I met my husband. Arthur, Brett, are the most known bartenders. But all the bartenders are great!!!! You will like the crowd, all are welcoming!!!!"}
{"text":"With a nicely done remodel comes an updated review.  Honestly, the main reason I am writing this is to say that I have come to love this place on one of it's 'off' nights.  Don't get me wrong, I love being there on a busy night when it's crowded and you can hardly move, but I've come to embrace the off nights where there is hardly anyone there.  It has come to be my place to go when I just want to get a drink and chat.  That is what most *insert my day of choice here* have become (I truly don't want to say what day it is for fear that it may become crowded on that night).  

And the remodel, can we talk about the remodel for a minute?  It's wonderful!  I'm so happy that they finally got rid of the doorway that divided the upstairs room, talk about bottle necking in a bar, now no more.  It also feels brighter upstairs and bigger.  Could be that they got rid of some walls, maybe that had something to do with it.

I cannot wait for warmer weather.  Not because everyone is going to be out in shorts and sleeveless shirts, but because of the amazing remodel of the deck.  Where the bar now resides, it feels like a ski lodge.  You walk in and you can smell the wood.  This little addition also adds more seating for people during hours they are open for food.  During the summer months looks as if they have the garage door openings to open the bar to the deck...away from the door openings to the deck, best part about the remodel I think.

And for those that complain about the cigarette smoke, with all the complaining you keep doing I'm sure you'll have this as a smoke free place.  Smoking is now restrained to the lower bar, away from the door.  No smoking in any other part of the building."}
{"text":"I really love this place for a number of reasons. This bar is more inviting and a bit classier than other gay bars around and while I love a good dive or drag bar, sometimes they can be too much. I don't come here often because it's a bit out of the way for me but when I do I always have a great time. The bartenders are friendly enough, the drinks are decent and the crowd is always a diverse mix of younger, older, and a handful of women. The place is big though I've never sat in the downstairs bar. I like the upstairs area and I love the outside patio and bar. The crowd is always fun and lively and I've never had a bad time here. It does get a bit crowded but I obviously don't hold that against the bar."}
{"text":"The patio is amazing! The drinks affordable and the environment is fun. We would have stayed here all night but there wasn't a dance floor. Great music inside but no place to dance. I will definitely go back here for sure."}
{"text":"Well  made drinks, very courteous staff, abundant food served late....hummus, awesome fresh made potato chips, fried zucchini

Nice Xmas decor. I liked the old bar set up but there is 
More room now

I don't like the smoky downstairs.

Had many good times here

Free soda so they encourage designated drivers.

Lots of places to sit"}
{"text":"It's my 200th Review!

I lerve this place, in cold weather, in warm weather, when I actually want to go out alone (it happens!), or when I'm in the mood to celebrate.

First, try coming here for dinner sometime.  They actually have one of the best hamburgers in Pittsburgh!  The food is really quite good.  I was surprised.

I am really allergic to cigarette smoke, so for that reason I usually sit up at the bar on the 2nd level, right before you go outside.  The thing I like about this place is that you'll like it not matter what you're in the mood for, patio, or usually in my case finding a quieter spot in a wooden booth.

They have a good selection of beers, and they make a damn good bloody mary.  The bartenders, waitstaff and clientele are all warm and welcoming.  I have never had a bad time at this place!

The outdoor patio is really nice, but the last time I was there people are smoking, so it was no bueno for me.  It's beautiful since its been remodeled."}
{"text":"I like 5801 especially being a single straight woman. If you're looking for a fun bar to go dancing by yourself or with a group and not get hassled by jerks all night 5801 is it.

Bartenders are OK. They're nothing special they do their job. 

Dance floor isn't huge but it works for what it is. Just be careful and not get hit by the crazy gay men hoisting their friends in the air."}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal service at the back deck bar. The bartenders completely ignored one side of the bar despite repeated attempts at getting their attention. Half eaten food was sitting all over the bar which was disgusting. I will never tip here again."}
{"text":"I love the patio here. Always a nice crowd, good music and friendly Pittsburgh locals hanging out. It's my favorite of the gay bars in the area, and they often have theme nights and friendly regulars around that love to chat up a friendly California girl. 
Make this your stop to get acquainted with the local gay scene in Pittsburgh, and know that the venue is friendly for gays and non gays in any case."}
{"text":"Cute place, cool atmosphere, great people. My boyfriend & I went here one night, LATE, sat up in the outside, rooftop area. It was an interesting night & sat as a reminder that I should STOP torturing myself by trying to have a dance off with gay guys...I NEVER WIN!!!"}
{"text":"Best gay bar in Pittsburgh by leaps and bounds. 

The lower level is dimly lit and still allows smoking. Minus. Up the steps to the second level and you can't smell the smoke anymore. Plus. They have dartboards, a decent sized dance floor, a larger bar and lots of video screens so you can watch Lady Gaga videos while you pick from the martini menu. They usually have drink specials. Outside on the patio is where 5801 really becomes something special. Lots of space and seating, but with all of the tiki torches and paper lanterns around, after a few drinks you'd swear you were at a summer block party. 

The staff has always been nice, the drinks have always been stiff, and I've never run into any drama at 5801. Nice mix of people of all ages. 5801 is just like any other nice, successful neighborhood bar. Except way gayer. And that's the way I like it!"}
{"text":"I went a couple of weeks ago and I really enjoyed my time there. I went with some friends around 7.30 so the night was still slow.

They have an amazing patio and the atmosphere is relaxed. They also have an indoor area which was basically empty and smoky that has a bar.

It is a LGBT establishment but it does not really come across as one at least that early at night. It is a very welcoming place attended by any gender and sexuality.

When I went there they were celebrating Christmas in July and selling paper snowflakes for $1 to raise money for an LGBT organization."}
{"text":"The bar has two floors and the space is great: there's plenty of seating, an outdoor patio that was outfitted with holiday decor when we visited, and there are a couple of dart boards, which we definitely enjoyed. The bartenders were friendly and they have an excellent beer selection, including Delirium Tremens.

I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I looooove this place. Everyone that works there is super nice, cheap/great food/drinks, gorgeous patio, good music!

We went over to Harris Grill the other day to sit out on the patio and have a drink and there was an hour wait! (what!?) so I remembered someone had told us that 5801 had a nice patio and we went over there--it wasn't crowded at all and it is WAY nicer than the patio at Harris Grill! 

The staff is always super nice and helpful and they will make you whatever drink you want.

Pros: Patio, cheap prices, nice staff, good music

Cons: I'm never a fan of smokey bars-you can smoke in the front of this one and on the patio--but I just have to suck it up I guess :)"}
{"text":"In short, bartender steph selectively provides very terrible customer service to some customers but the managers are understanding if you have an issue. Here's why... 

I go to this bar very infrequently and generally have an okay experience but the above rating is due to very terrible customer service we received from two of the bartenders (Steph specifically) on the same night. 

Started with ordering a shandy. The drink tasted nothing like shandy but my friend drank it anyway just to not cause any trouble only to find out later from another employee (steph) that they actually don't have shandys. Rather than simply saying they don't have the it, they proceeded to give us something that \"tastes like\" it without even letting us know. Bartender's response when I confronted him was \"it's the closest we got\" while rolling his eyes. Since when is this acceptable?

Long story short, I calmly requested a refund for that drink since they clearly knowingly gave us the wrong drink... In return I get zero apologies, an angry bartender (steph) starting to scream asking me if I wanted a shot and telling me to bring the drink back if I wanted a refund. I tried to deescalate her incivility and she immediately started to not acknowledge that I was even there or that there was an issue. At this point, I asked her name, which she lied about and told me was \"samantha\". I spoke to the manager who seemed understanding of the ridiculousness of the situation and terrible customer service provided by his employees and refunded my drinks. Otherwise the atmosphere is just ok. Lots of smoking etc. I probably will not be going back for a while."}
{"text":"Drinks were good and short line for the women's restroom"}
{"text":"A long long time ago, on a cold winter night, I checked out 5801 and was disappointed. I remember a smoke filled room with way to loud music and kind of overall dive bar feel to it. Fast forward hollywood-style a couple of summers, I enter 5801 dragged by friends only to find the best hidden patio area in all of Pittsburgh. Good atmosphere, no more cigarette smoke, gotta check it out gay or not."}
{"text":"My favorite bar on Ellsworth.  It's a gay sports bar.  They probably have the best deck in Pittsburgh.  People are generally friendly and they have smoking at the downstairs bar and outside.  The upstairs section is smoke free.  The bartenders are generally friendly and attentive.  Overall... one of the best bars in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Video lounge?  Huh?
Cafe?  Huh?  Try a gay bar.
That being said.....GREAT."}
{"text":"Of all the gay bars in the city, 5801 (or \"58\" as the locals call it) is by far the best. I've visited many times and never had a bad time or a bad drink. 

The thing I love most about this place is the space. It's actually pretty big! The first floor is the smoker's bar as smoking is allowed. They have bar seating as well as high tables and a jukebox with any song you could imagine. I tend to stay away from this area because of the smoke. The second floor (non-smoking) consists of a bigger bar, booths and dart boards. Their latest addition is the spacious outdoor patio which is accessible from the second floor. Half of it is outside and the other half is indoors with the bar in the middle that separates the two. 

Drinks are always very good! I never had a bad one. My favorite is their Long Island which is on special on Thursday I believe. Bartenders are usually very friendly as well.

If you're hungry, they have a kitchen that's open till around 11. I've only had their nachos, but they were very good and loaded to the brim. You won't find a steak and potato dinner, but a classier type of bar food. 

Weekends are usually busy here and they do have decent specials throughout the week to get people in the door. They also hold bingo games once a week hosted by a drag queen. Crowd is usually mixed as well."}
{"text":"Always a decent crowd. Bar staff for the most part is very friendly. Just your neighborhood Shadyside bar."}
{"text":"I'm undecided-
Some people live in this bar.
Get drunk and then leave."}
{"text":"If I'm going to a gay bar in Pittsburgh, this one's probably it. I like it because in my opinion, It's the nicest of all the gay bars here; it's elegant looking, and always clean. There's always a variety of people of all genders, orientations, ages, and \"tribes\" if you will, and the bartenders (all of them are good, but Brett is my fav!) aren't rude like a lot of other gay bars. 

It's got three separate bars on different levels. They just completed renovations on, and opened the patio, which is great. There's an outdoor heating lamp for when it gets cold. 

A lot of people don't realize, but 58 is also a full restaurant with waiter service. Sometimes it takes them a while to get to you if it's busy, but this is probably the only one of it's kind in this city. The food is a step above typical greasy bar food, and they always have interesting specials that usually run for a week or so. Their specialty drinks are always great, and Thursday's are $3 Long Islands night; Yes, I will be late to work tomorrow."}
{"text":"5801 is the go-to place for my coworkers and I to go for happy hour.  I've been here in all kinds of circumstances....straight from work at 5 pm (when we were basically the only people there), and also at 2 am on the crowded dance floor.  The music is great, the patio is expansive and comfortable, and the bartenders are really friendly.   Their happy hour actually doesn't start until 6, but I like that because that gives me time to actually GET there - usually when bars have happy hours that start at 5 pm, I've already missed half of it by the time I arrive.  They have a creative martini list and the bartenders are willing to make you surprise creations if you aren't sure what to order.  I've only had a little bit of food here - spinach/artichoke dip, hummus, sweet potato fries, buffalo chicken dip - all were perfectly tasty, a step above regular bar food quality.

Everyone is comfortable and welcome here.  My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time dancing here late one night, and we love how they play music videos!  Sometimes we'd just stop talking, drift off, and watch the videos.  I'll give it 5 stars just because it's been consistently great, service is super friendly, clientele is awesome (this is the kind of place where you make new \"best friends\" in 5 minutes), and it's good for both a chill drink and a crazy dance-off depending on when you show up."}
{"text":"This place smells like cigarette smoke, even in the \"non-smoking\" section. if you're from a city that has moved into the 21st century, (NYC, DC) you will find this bar and this city to be an uncharming backwater. it's the worst of the Midwest combined with the worst of Pennsylvania (which is basically the Midwest (and I'm not using Midwest as a compliment))"}
{"text":"Not only is the food banging, the service is great. I love everything about this bar. The appetizers are delicious and the sandwiches are incredible. The house salad with the dill dressing is huge and so filling! But the food won't kill your wallet. Drafts are a little pricey, but not too pricey that I wouldn't drink them. Their sound system is great, as is the television set up."}
{"text":"5801 was the best way to close out a busy week in Pittsburgh, PA.  The next time I visit the city, I'll return, eat, and drink.  Staff are polite, great service, and great bartenders.  Nothing to complain about.  And crowd was mixed, as 5801 fully describes on its website.

Spending time there was the best few hours I had in 6 nights!"}
{"text":"\"580-1309\"

This place is enormous.  I am not actually sure I saw the whole thing!  Suggest doing a lap before you commit to a location.

As a NY'er I was shocked you could smoke inside!  Unfortunately this was where the cute guys were.  So I had to invest in Febreeze.  Fine.

Fun place, and easy to go with a group of friends.  Many spots to hide if you need to.  The patio was such a pleasant surprise, felt like I was back in NY.  P.S. this place def has its regulars and if you're from out of town they sniff you out like a bad gallon of milk.

Not sure where the video part comes from but wasn't a deal breaker. 

The vodka came out of a soda gun which was worrisome, so don't expect a jacked up drink, its to the measure.  Bartenders were all super sweet.  That being said I don't know why almost everyone here was WASTED but me?"}
{"text":"Nice setting, nice bartenders, friendly enough crowd. Thebproces are decent. 5.50 for a single. The food smelled pretty good but doesn't most fried items?

Why did I give this place only one star then?  Drinking metering machine. Who uses those?  Gay bars are famous for serving cheap strong drinks. The drinks here are watered down and not even worth the 5.50!

Go across the street to spin instead. They have free pour. Hell go to any other real bar. There's plenty over this way. Harris grill that new tipsy cow looks good. 

Avoid this place if you want a good drink. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This place was almost all white people, it felt like a KKK rally. Drinks were too expensive and the overall vibe was snooty. I also hate smelling French fries and funnel cakes when I'm out drinking barf"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great dancing, great drinks, great crowd, loved the music videos! The DJ was a bit of a jerk, but I wouldn't want drunk people setting drinks near my equipment, either. I loved that he would randomly play the electric drums during the songs he was playing. Really cute.

I would come here all the time if I lived in PGH!"}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere, nobody will bother you and bartenders are friendly. Drinks are slightly more pricey than other bars in Pittsburgh, but the atmosphere is worth it. There is a beautiful outdoor patio for warmer weather."}
{"text":"I really love to come to 5801 for a fun night! The patio area is so spacious- there is a bar and many places to sit and enjoy your drinks! Even if you need to get away from the crowd- the patio is it!  The bar itself is spacious, there is one on the first floor, and one on the second. On the first floor, there is an iTunes electronic juke box, which is awesome to play some of your favorite hits, even the ones that you normally wouldn't be able to find on a top 10 list! There is a decent space to dance to the hits you just picked and paid for and everyone is doing their own thing, so it's not like people are staring at you. There are also bar stools around this area where you can throw your stuff on and dance the night away! The nacho appetizer was really good and the drinks aren't too expensive! On the second floor, you can sit at booths, play darts, or enjoy the spacious area around the bar! This is, by far, one of my favorite places to go and enjoy the night!"}
{"text":"There are two types of people in this world; sheep and not-sheep. If you would classify yourself as the premier, then by all means 5801 should become your new hangout!

The drinks are poured precisely to the shot (aiding a perfectly proportioned mediocre night at best) The clientelle is typical gay pittsburgh, hardly anyone is interesting enough to have a decent conversation with for more then 2 minutes. (and they all kind of look like they were rejected from Los Angeles)

The music is the worst,  typical gay pop remixes blare from this place. When will gay bars realize that we aren't in the late 90's anymore?

The interior is decorate and reminiscent of a Radisson hotel lobby. (Which isn't good) The bartenders are neither pretty nor polite. I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Excited to check it out even though Monday night.  Food ok for bar food, however,  bartender had no energy and lack of service. Asked questions but not too informative.   I think  I knew more from reading the Internet before I got here.  Started to get crowded around 8."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were visiting my mom in Carnegie and we needed to get out and find something a little more exciting before we left. A bear friend of my mom's recommended 5801 and we had a great time even though we were just talking. The three separate bars are great - we were able to get away from the hideously smoke-filled lounger, which is really pretty and had awesome bartenders, but...ugh, cigarettes. the \"upstairs\" bar was also very nice, much less smokey, so that's where we stayed. patio was CROWDED.

all the bartenders are amazing and have very deft hands. I LOVE the cocktails, especially for their names, like \"Platinum Blonde\" and \"Smurf Cum\" - absolutely delicious, and you can't taste the booze at all. the \"upstairs\" bar was not too loud so best friend and I could actually carry a conversation without shouting, which seems a bit backwards considering the lounge bar is smaller and more intimate, but the music (while great) is BLARING.

each bar has a different atmosphere, which is also pretty cool. I'm also glad that they welcome all genders, so that my best friend could walk in with his token straight girl with no trouble ;)"}
{"text":"It's the go-to place for gays in Shadyside, but I'd like to see some refinement in the menu, drinks, and service. 

I don't want to feel like I'm inconveniencing or confusing the server, and I'm tired of getting a glass that's sticky from spilling on the way to my table. 

I also noticed the sound system on the outdoor rooftop deck is malfunctioning. It'll die right in the middle of a good song. Maybe it's not the right system for the volume or venue??"}
{"text":"Beautiful deck, great bartenders, fun atmosphere - loved it!"}
{"text":"Best homo bar in Pitt!  The staff and clientele are friendly.  The food menu looked delish (didn't try anything) and the music was fun.  

As a lesbian it seemed cauttivo was my only bar option and I really didn't like it.  So I'm glad I found this little gem that has a good mix of guys and gals.

Perk: didn't take long to get a drink!"}
{"text":"I'm so very sad that frozen drinks are discontinued...tangerine dream is my all-time fave. It's ok though because the jukebox is kickin' and the back patio is always packed. Never a dull, boring or bad time here. Never."}
{"text":"During our brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was definitely our favorite bar.  It's attractive, nicely laid out, and the bartenders, staff and clientele are very friendly and welcoming.  We did not try anything on the menu, but the drinks were good, and the videos well selected."}
{"text":"This bar literally makes staying in Pittsburgh livable. I'd  highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Stopped here the other day and must admit - they've made significant changes for the better at this place. Bartender was nice. Server was a sweetie. the dill dip was very good. 
The outside patio is beautiful. A+"}
{"text":"Have you been to the new porch?! Styling! 

Beautiful atmosphere, and lots of places where friends can sit and talk and still be heard. 

Excellent drink selection and friendly service."}
{"text":"Yes, of course 5801 is my favorite gay bar in Pittsburgh. From the friendly servers to the great music and dancing... it is just a fun place to be any night of the week. 

But you must never go there. Nope. Because the secret must never get out that 5801 has some of the most DELICIOUS and CHEAP bar food in Pittsburgh. Those capitalized words? They usually don't go hand in hand. Not so at 5801. They have found the magic formula for quality bites that won't hurt your wallet. The menu has something for everybody. Eight types of dips/chips to share, wraps, salads, even pizza and wings! Everything I have had there is large portioned and yummy. 

As for the environment, it varies according to day of the week and area of the lounge. As others have said before, smoking is still permitted downstairs. However, 5801 is so large that you can avoid the nicotine by either going upstairs or enjoying your drinks and watching the game on the large outdoor patio and bar. 

Stay away, though! I don't want crowds getting in on my $3.75 long island Thursdays and daily happy hour specials (6-8 pm). 

...

Ok, fine. You can come. I hope to see you all there!"}
