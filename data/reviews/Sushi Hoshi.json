{"text":"Beaucoup plus de choix le soir, mais je préfère y aller le midi vu l'excellent rapport qualité/prix. Service très rapide. Je trouve seulement ordinaire que la banane frite ne soit pas incluse dans le prix."}
{"text":"It's ok.

Much of the pieces are ok to good. But the service is so lengthy and it's so packed, I can't give 4 stars.

The tablet system is just flashy. But doesn't do much. It's frozen half the time or need to be unlock after each order.

I only went for dinner, didn't try the lunch.

For the price point, I would expect more. 

I concluded that if I want to treat myself to some sushi. I might just travel a bit more to get a higher quality."}
{"text":"Excellents sushis, service excessivement rapide avec des serveurs talentueux. Les soupes, les sushis, le teriyaki sont bons. Situé à côté du gym dans les galléries des Laurentides. Il faut apporter son propre vin ou saké! Je recommande"}
{"text":"Principe à volonté ! 
Belle sortie familiale.
Les soupers sont plus dispendieux 
Commande via une tablette."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi - normally something I don't do, but it was busy and that's usually a good sign.

Menu is computer based, but they still seemed short on  staff. Not that service was slow(actually it was quite fast), but somewhat less comfortable then actually having a server. 

Most of the staff speaks French - a few English. So if your traveling like I am, no worries there.

The actual components of the sushi where solid. Not amazing, but fresh enough to enjoy but nothing to write home about. 

Construction of rolls was just ok. The sushi rice was fresh, but heavily westernized-just barely meeting the definition of \"sushi rice\"

The menu was some what limited with nearly every single roll containing salmon and/or mayonnaise of some variety. And that's what killed off two more stars - mayonnaise everywhere...on everything...

With a bit more menu effort and a lot less mayo, the place could be a decent strip mall sushi place...right now it's obvious they are still figuring things out."}
