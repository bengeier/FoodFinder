{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  Went in a paid for dinner Thomas the rude behaved employee working the register said upon walking to table that I need to come back to the register because of confusion?  I had no idea what the he'll he was talking about.  It was about 45 minutes till closing.  I followed him back to register he pointed at another customer an asked if I was with him?  I said no I came in alone gave you a $20 got change an was being seated or so I thought.  He starts telling the other guy that he owes more money then proceeds to shake me down.  I have never heard of such a thing in this country.  I demand my money back an ask to speak to the owner or manager cause this assclown Thomas is trying to extort money from me.  Thomas the assclown says owner not here an no manager.  I have gone to this buffet several time before an never been extorted this is clearly something Thomas has started to make some extra cash.  I will never return and I intend to share my bad experience with everyone.  Horrible horrible way to treat customers.  If the owner ever reads this please get in touch with me your employee Thomas is stealing from your customers."}
{"text":"Yummy food very friendly Lots to chose from won ton Great Spring roll are awesome the ribs are a joke.  I usually like the spicy octopus and that was bad.  The dessert selection is Huge. The ice cream comes in personal containers that are delicious! Flavors like vanilla cookies and cream chocolate, green tea , coffee ect.  It took 3x to get a high chair that was not broken"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, had high expectation since we tried the same buffet in SD that has really good food & fancy decor. This is a major disappointment! First we were shocked by the high price: price of lunch is equal to dinner! Except for sweet & sour chicken & apple pie, everything is at best luke warm! Most of the desserts are not fresh, chocolate cakes are really dry! Compare to the other Chinese buffets here in town like Jumbo Buffet, China Star, & Buffet Asia, this has fewer selection & worse service!"}
{"text":"Roach infested!  I was craving chinese one day after leaving the mall & we decided to give it a try and grab some take out. It wasn't too bad and the price was reasonable so we came back a couple times a dined in. Sadly, today will be our last time we ever go there. I went to grab a second plate of food and as I sat down a roach crawled right past me on the table and onto the ledge. I seriously froze and didnt know what to do. I was watching the roach crawl past the customers in front of me only to see another one right next to the customer on the back rest of their booth.. The hostess that was there walked right past it and looked directly at it and kept walking.. I still want to hurl. That is so unsanitary and disgusting. If that happens right in front of house where customers are sitting and eating I don't even want to imagine what goes on in that kitchen. You have lost our business & I expect something to be done about this. I am not sure how this place remained in business under these nasty conditions."}
{"text":"This might be the first Chinese buffet that had fried rice available that wasn't bright yellow and full of huge chunks of onion.  Also they have a spicy chicken that most other buffets seem to have gotten away from.  The real star of the buffet though (besides the neon sign above the entrance to the bathroom that reads \"resteroom\") is the Hibachi grill.  Nice fresh vegetables and a good assortment of meats, good teriyaki and garlic sauce, and a nice talkative guy behind the glass making it all for you!  Hooray!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. DON'T let them pay you out at the table! They will add a tip and then present you back the bill to add more tip! They added 10% and then acted all innocent after we mentioned it."}
{"text":"Six entries out.  Told management, reply \"you will then just have to wait\".  Don't think so.  Service good this time but don't think I will be back.  Food fair and only warm, if that."}
{"text":"BEWARE  ROACH!!  I was in this place today for a lunch meeting. Never again will I go back. First the buffet restocking is terrible. There are little or empty item bins for long periods of time. One sauce item wasn't restocked the entire time we were there and we talked for over an hour. Other items are cold and no one will take them so they remain cold and unstocked. Catch 22 on those items, people won't take the cold item and they won't restock until they're gone. However, the food was tasting good UNTIL there he was, making his way across the top of the dividing wall, naked as a jay bird. Mr. Cucaracha, ?? in the native tongue! I tried to get him but he slipped my flick and darted between the post and rail sitting quietly unnoticed watching four people eating their lasts buffet find. He was very patiently waiting for a few crumbs to fall so he could harvest it up and bring it to his 10,264 children back at his abode under the half wall. I went to snap a picture but by the time I walked around the long way, as not to alert the unsuspecting diners at the table that he was 6 inches from, he was gone. Good tasting food or not, ROACH and I'm gone and won't be back! If you're a fan of General Tso Roach or Sweet and Sour Roach, then this is the place for you! We just paid are bill and PEACED OUT!"}
{"text":"Suprise why this place get such low ratings when it is the largest n most wide selections of Asian buffet in LV. It never fail me every time I m here to get my fill of deliciousness The stations r always replenished with fresh food. The place is extremely clean. And the wait staffs r always there to take away your dirty plates or give U a refill when they see your glass half empty.  Please give this place a chance people. Thank u!"}
{"text":"Barf. Vomit. Puke. Yes im describing the food and what i had to do after eating here. Do I need to say more?"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on the reviews I read here. Apparently lunch is a stellar time to go, because at 4:30 in the afternoon it was dismal at best. The highlight of the evening was the salad bar, as the hot buffet items had neither been refreshed or looked appealing. Needless to say, I was disappointed and would run back to Lin's. This isn't saying much for the place because Lin's has been passably mediocre at best. Trying something new didn't turn out well this time, but this renegade foodie will try, try again!"}
{"text":"Went there early, was charged for dinner and then told we had to wait over 30 minutes for dinner food to be put out. We were already done eating by the time dinner was put out. ALL employees including the man cooking at the grill station were very rude and food was nasty!!! Will never go here again!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, good price and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"This place has a rude attendant and on top of that there's flies on food, I went with my family and since I have a son of 3 years old the owner told the waiter to sit us in the back so she sat us next to the kitchen which was uncomfortable because we can smell the dirty dishes and since we paid for lunch which we were not aware of the times for lunch and dinner, we arrived there like 15 mins before dinner so when we attempted to get food he said it was for dinner only and charged us $5 extra or he was going to take our food away. I certainly won't be back and I don't recommended if you like clean food."}
{"text":"I've been here several times within the past couple of years.   I'm not typically a fan of buffets, be it because the quality of the food being served is questionable, or because variety is nearly non-existent. Hibachi Grill offers both quality and variety for a reasonable price. AND, they have Mongolian BBQ. :D  I'm not going to say the food is the best I've ever had, but for a buffet, it's surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, but when it comes down to the owner or manager whoever he is.. he is really rude to his employees. He screams at them infront of the customer which is really unprofessional. The food is ok. Im a big fan of egg drop soup but when i went in to try theirs it was super cold. I didnt even bother to try and eat it."}
{"text":"On a whim went in with no idea what to expect. The exterior lacks the pizazz of some of the neighboring buildings but once inside I was elated to find a sea of steaming basins. The selection is enormous. And the quality very impressive. Much better food quality than most giant buffets I have dined in.   There is plenty of American food, and even some tacos, for those inclined. For me it was all about the clams, egg foo yung, dumplings, beef and broccoli, steamed flounder, crayfish, and soups.   I look forward to coming back with some serious munchies and more time. The desserts look awesome."}
{"text":"I'll start of with their awsome water fountain. The beautiful fish are honestly picture worthy. I has very sad that their food wasn't as good as i expected to be. Even though they do provide various food options. But for starters the chow mein was dry. The food was also cold and just doesnt taste good."}
{"text":"The food was decent and very similar to the other location at Southern and Alma School in Mesa. The server was pleasant, so overall I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a couple friends. It's no Las Vegas Bellagio, but for the price I think it is a good value, and all the food was good. The decor could use a bit of updating but I was amazed at the wide selection of Asian foods but also there was everything from Polish sausage to onion rings to pizza. Service was good, the waitress brought drinks and cleared our dirty plates quickly. I'll be back when I'm in the mood for a Chinese and fried food smorgasbord or just a great variety of everything from appetizers to entrees to desserts."}
{"text":"Ok food. but management is terrible. The manger is rude and decided to pick a fight with is over the tip even though she had poor service. As I was looking a the bill she comes and snatches it from my hand and my bank card. We will never go here again.  Rude people, dirty restrooms, and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Went there last night and it was so disgusting , i felt sick after leaving the restaurant! The shrimp was gross and disgusting, the lo mein was cold and nasty! All the food looked old! The waitress even said they weren't busy that day so I'm sure they haven't changed the food! I did call the manager & she did say that if i had food poisoning her insurance would cover my bill, but still Everyone be ware! Go to Ihop instead! Or china buffet in KP! I did not want to want give them 1 star!"}
{"text":"The overall experience was pretty good The buffet food was great but the grill was not very good would definitely come back for the buffet food again"}
{"text":"A lot of mediocre food for a very reasonable price.  If you're really hungry, you can find some decent stuff there, like fresh shrimp, salt and pepper shrimp, mussels on the half shell and the grean beans were terrific.  The food line up was strange.  Ice cream, sushi and shrimp, desserts, salads and then entrees.  Overall, okay, for the price.  Was really hoping for something \"supreme\" as they've been working hard to tranform an old buffet house into something special.  Won't be a regular, but won't say I won't go back either."}
{"text":"This is a very good buffet.  All the food was fresh, nothing tasted or looked like it had sat in a steamer very long.  Also looked clean and the employees all looked professional, unlike most Oriental places in the valley.  Lots and lots of food.  Very reasonably priced.  Overall, very decent place!"}
{"text":"This buffet has a TON of different things to try. Crab legs, oysters, dim sum,  sushi, etc. It is extremely reasonable too at just $13.95 for dinner. If you like sweets be prepared to go crazy! Cakes, ice cream, coconut pudding,  jello......the list goes on. If you are in the area, give it a try."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times. I would have to say the food was ok. However, first visit eggshells where found in the rice. Understandable, it happens! Second time paper was in one if the dishes. Ok. This last visit was the last. Service was horrible. And also in a cold dish, a cockroach. I politely gave my plate to the server, who seemed like this was a norm. Then headed to the restroom, where I returned my meal. No apology was given. I paid my check and waived good bye. Eaters beware, nasty items are in the food!"}
{"text":"It's great fresh food, better the dragon and buffet of asia that is right around the corner. I've been there a few times. It's pricey but worth the extra few bucks. Quality and quantity well worth it. Ill be going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Have to start off by saying I usually don't do these reviews but today I'm making an exception. This place is horrid, filthy, and the food is bland, gross, disgusting.... I would have never left a review it weren't for finding bugs in my food!! Complete disgusting and when I asked for my money back they were only willing to give me a free meal for next time!! Like what the hell do you honestly think I would eat here again. Please don't eat here this place needs to get shut down its that gross. That's my opinion see for yourself.   I'll be uploading pics of one of the bug for all to see!"}
{"text":"This was only my second time setting foot in a Chinese Buffet, as they are not really my thing, but I went today for a some work research and was pleasantly surprised!   The space was tastefully decorated and had a modern vibe to it, not what I was expecting. I think I could have done without the neon lights around the buffet area, but that is the main attraction and I guess they need to lead you there! The buffet had lots of variety of both Asian and American foods (kielbasa anyone?....weird?). There seemed to be a little bit of an issue with the labeling, some items were labeled, some were not, and some were labeled wrong; like the shrimp that was labeled \"corn dog.\" I tried the dumplings, orange chicken, hibachi chicken, fried rice, lo mein and some cream cheese won tons. They were all tasty and still hot. They also have a large salad bar for those wanting to eat light, which was a nice touch.   I didn't try the Hibachi grill section, but there was a line of people, so it was being enjoyed. The sushi was a bit questionable looking, but I don't really think that is their thing.   For the price, $6.59 for lunch, you just can't beat it....so while I probably won't go out of my way to go again....it is not a bad option."}
{"text":"I have been to MANY Chinese buffets including Southern California, this is by far the best ever!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be not so great because seafood is expensive and it was really cheap and we used the free meal coupon that we found in their ad.   Anyway, the peel and eat shrimp wasn't bad, the sushi fish wasn't terrible either, but I thought it was weird that they just had straight up cut fish as opposed to sashimi. The tom yum wasn't bad, but I've had better. It tasted like this one was made with chicken stock which is... Odd. The orange chicken was okay, but again I've had better. The crab legs cracked open easily, but most pieces didn't have any flavor as if they'd been frozen too long. The muscles were fishy. The clams were PACKED with sand. The oysters were the nastiest I've ever had. None of the flavors in them were positive. I didn't get to try the hibachi station so I can't speak for that. But hey, I didn't get food poisoning! And you get what you pay for.  This review got two stars because the service was pretty awful. I didn't really see the waitress after she set down our drinks and we had to hunt her done for a refill. But hey, if you can hunt the waiters down the beers are only $2!  If you want something that's a little bit better quality-wise go to Fremont casino for seafood night."}
{"text":"Hibachi has very friendly staff the price is not bad and the food is pretty good. Not a very large variety of suchi but alot of choices in food and desserts."}
{"text":"This is a new place and the food was very good as far as buffets go. The price is very affordable. I rated 4 out of 5 simply because the wait staff was lacking basic customer service skills. We had asked a waiter for something and he told us that we needed to ask the waitress that was assigned to the table. Eventually, he ended up helping us out regardless. I think he could have agreed and told our original waitress in the back or complied with the request without saying anything. Other than that, good food, decent prices, and good atmosphere. I would definitely visit again and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Some staff are a bit rude but best orange chicken ive tasted since i moved from cali!  :)"}
{"text":"Can't believe the quality and taste we got for $10 buffet!!! All dishes were freshly made and especially the seafood quality is amazing! The place is huge with diverse selections. Every dish is well made and taste uniquely great (not like some buffet everything taste the same). Amazing would totally come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a great selection. Salad section had brown lettuce as well as the hibachi grill. The gentleman over cooked  the meat and seemed like he just slopped it over. The sushi section was not a big deal; rice was lumpy and overcooked; it was also a bad rice to nigiri ratio. Will not return."}
{"text":"Wide selection of food; however, warm not hot.  Servers are rude and ask for tips.  Not sure that I will go back."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  So gross...disgusting...nasty...yuck..I can't even explain it.  I went here three weeks ago it was fine.  Went to try it again last night...it was sooo horrible.  It's not worth the money.  If it was free, I wouldn't even want it.  It looks like non-experience chef made the food.  I'm not a chef but I can cook better than them.  It seems like they just dump the food in a wok and overload with salt and put whatever spices they want.  It wasn't enjoyable.  So sad...this place is going to go downhill unless they do something about it."}
{"text":"So far, this location is better than the other two on the westside (Metrocenter & Maryvale).  It has more than five vegetables that are not fried nor breaded which I like. The Hibachi Chicken is yumm-m-m.  You have a choice of fried fish or steamed fish.  I like the watermelon and cantaloupe, that's another plus.  The sushi could use some improvement, they all look like they have the same ingredients and made in different styles so I rather not eat none.  The bbq cook need not overwater the vegetables and protein so much.  There are other choices, some are very good and some needs improvement.  I'm a lacto/ovo/pescetarian & occasionally eat chicken.  Summer prices are down, $5.99 lunch, $7.99 dinner with another 20% discount between 2-4pm including Seniors (anytime).  Hopefully, we will see some improvement after I post and mention the reviews to the owner/manager whom I talk to on occasions."}
{"text":"My wife and kids love this place ..unfortunately i do not food looks like its been sitting out for days not alot of selection for so called surpreme buffet"}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffets I've been. There's always staff monitoring the bar to keep the fresh food coming. The habachi grill is amazing. My son loves the koi fish in the waiting area. Everything seems very clean and the staff is professional and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food.  I'm sure some wait staff can be rude.  That happens everywhere.  Never saw a Roach,  or anything like that.  It is too expensive.  Wanna know if you will like it?  Go.  If you are a picky person,  I'm sure you will find something to complain about.  That sign saying you get penalized for wasted food is ridiculous."}
{"text":"We have been here for quite awhile now since we moved to Phoenix couple years ago. Their food quality is ok at times. And we have been getting the loyalty stamps every time we go to this place, except for today. As usual, I showed my military ID to receive my military discount as soon as we got our table.   For the first time, we were told by the owner's daughter who is in charge today that we could not receive the loyalty stamp because I received my 10% discount on my part (but my spouse paid full price). We were not informed of the policy change when I showed my military ID. No one told us anything until after I paid for our check.   My point is that an early notice will be appreciated. Besides, if my spouse came in by herself and paid full price for her own meal, she would still receive a loyalty stamp. Why wouldn't we receive a loyalty stamp when we both paid almost $30 together before adding tips to it? I personally do not appreciate how they handled it. Plus today's food was definitely more greasy than usual. Ice-cream was melting even before I opened the lid. Would I want to go back? I am not too sure anymore. I may just have to drive a little further out to Jasmine Tokyo in Scottsdale from now on or go to the Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler which is near my work. Those two buffet restaurants also offer military discounts, and their food quality is definitely better. Besides, I have just tried out an excellent \"all you can eat sushi\" restaurant (order as you go, not the buffet style) in Gilbert called Orient Sushi Grill. Their sushi and rolls were freshly made as you order them. You pay about $24 per person, but you definitely get more than what you pay for there."}
{"text":"The food here had no flavor very dry and on some food very salty the workers that are in the back randomly come out grab plates of food and go right to the back  The dinner special where it's supposed to be more seafood is a lie its the same as it is for lunch there was no difference our waitress was rude and couldn't understand her and the lil English she did know she would get in your face I was very unhappy with it and when I let the manager know and that I'd like a refund he refused but there was no sign saying no refunds he just kept insisting on me eating the food instead, the same towel that they clean the tables with was the same towel that my waitress was cleaning the floor with! And to top it all of two of the cooks started a fight with each other and was throwing plates very unprofessional for that business I will not be coming here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only tried lunch buffet and it was great for the little price $7.99 per adult, with huge selection! There are so many items to choose from, although not everything delicious, some fried foods and meat are very tough to chew and hard to swallow, but there are other dishes that are good. They have fish, shrimp, and clams during lunch time, for the price I cannot expect more! I like that their ice creams are in little cups, green tea ice cream is yummy!  3.5 star for the food. 5 star for the price for lunch buffet.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"been back several times since my last review. As far as I am concern, it is still the best buffet within ten mile radius."}
{"text":"Experience was horrible we got there at 2:27 and manager sat us down.she never made clear watvshe had charge us for,as we went to grab food ma litle brother went to the grill and put shrimp on his plate and the cook literally grab his plate and pour it back into the container and said u cant touch does this its dinner people only ,we talk to the manager and she just started arguying with us,so unproffesional never going back again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is GROSS.... i got a coke the glass was dirty and when i asked her for a new drink and NEW cup  beacuse the one she gave me was dirty , she looked at me like i had to heads ..  she came back with a new coke with the SAME cup and when i asked to speak to a manager , when the manager came over he said i would have to be charged for another cup ... NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!   sooo cheap and the food sucked ,  food was soo salty and gross"}
{"text":"there was fucking 6 cockroaches in my fucking chocolate pudding!!!!!  the dr.pepper is really good here though so I'll come back"}
{"text":"Good service but food just OK. A lot of items to choose from. Probably won't go again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we went on a Sunday for lunch the place was busy over 50% full so food was turning over quickly and we eat Chinese at least 1-2 time per week. Hot and sour soup was all sour no hot at all. The sweet and sour chicken was overly breaded and very hard. The fried rice was dry some was so hard had to spit it out. The orange chicken was not good didn't taste like any ones orange chicken I've ever had. Honey chicken was good though their cream puffs that you buy from Costco were nasty tasted very stale (I normally love these) the strawberries didn't look or taste fresh at all they were soft my 2yr old didn't even want to eat it. The waiter/ waitress were nice had a hard time asking and them understanding water light ice and a lemon.   All in all this is the first and the last time I will go to this restaurant I'd I could have I would have given it a 0 yes zero stars.   Glad my mother in law paid for lunch is all I got to say"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Asian buffets, mainly because the meats allow you to avoid carbs. I read the reviews on this place and almost didn't go in.  I figured what the heck, if I don't like what I see I am in control to leave or complain. The male server was very professional, didn't feel any pressure, and the quality and selection were great for the price. I wasn't going to leave a tip walking in, but I ended up leaving a tip cuz the kid with was cool, even after I just ordered a water with lemon.  I would recommend giving this place a try. They could clean the walls, and offer WiFi to paying customers without handing your device over for them to enter in the password,  but it's a good spot. Give it a try. I think the music was ok, too. I don't remember."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever.   Everything except the soup was cold.   The cheese filled wontons were like chewing on old boot leather.    The sushi wasn't kept cold and was pale in color like it was old.    I don't recommend and the one star is for the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"I don't know who writes these review but NOT GOOD.  One thing the food was not up to temp. all foods suppose to be.  The foods didn't seems to have absolute any flavors. Their fried rice was lifeless with no flavor, and COLD. The foods didn't looked appealing at all. This was the first time we went to this place & the last.  There was food on the floor and fruit didn't taste good, maybe GMO'S probably. The green beans were COLD & HARD, need to be cook alittle more.  I was completely dissatisfied.  : ("}
{"text":"If you want a management that has no interest in listening to a friendly concern, that quickly turned into a complaint, then by all means go to this place! The problem started when being seated by a thoroughly unprofessional person, dressed in attire better suited to a teens bedroom, certainly not what I want to see when going to eat!  The problem was yet to come however, as we were seated, we were asked not if we wanted additional drinks, but what flavor sodas we would like. I did not ask if they were included in the meal, because she was presenting them as part of the meal.  When we paid, we then found out they were not included in the meal, not really a big deal, except the way she presented the request was deceitful.  I could live with that sort of, after all it is a Chinese Buffet place and some are not so honest it turns out.   The problem really became an issue when I called and explained to the manager what had happened and because this was the second time we had a problem at Hibachi Grill, we would not be returning.   The person on the phone kept telling me it was my own fault, I should have know the drinks were not included. He told me I actually had the responsibility to know what she meant!   There is nothing in this place that states the drink policy. The manager kept telling me he was listening when I told him he was not listening, as he was just blowing me off, by telling me it was all my fault!  I only wanted to talk to him about how she tricked us and I felt it was not very customer friendly. After attempting to talk to him, I could see how the hostess was most likely coached by his poor attitude to lie to customers.   Long and short of the story, do not go there. Not very honest, and this is the second time I have had a problem there. The first one was an issue with my card and their attempt to double charge me.  I always believe in giving a second chance, but they really blew their second chance!  There are many places to eat around, go to one of them instead!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great not anymore service was terrible like I said me and my wife used to come here all the time it's exact opposite of what it used to be her used to be great now it is terrible to not go and eat here foods old not fresh sushi was bad hibachi grill used to have great steak meat for dinner now the steak meat is tough and terrible at the soup was awful the hot and sour just terrible place was empty no kidding . My wife and I ate there about a month ago I will never eat there again and used to be our once every month once every month and a half place to eat try and Asian seafood buffet near arrowhead mall in the parking lot fantastic a little more money but it's totally worth it king crab legs a great sushi all you can eat sushi meet it's just the way you want to eat like I said it's in the parking lot of arrowhead mall"}
{"text":"Hair in my salmon!! For starters. Then horrible customer service! The owner refused to give me a discount or give me meal for free yet any good quality restaurant would say i apologize take it back meals on us half off coupon something! And they left the salmon out didnt think to throw it away make a fresh one or anything. The waiters attitude was a jerk. And its not like this is my 1st and only bad experience. Ive been here before but never going back again!! The food was cold not fresh tasted weird."}
{"text":"This place use to be a really great place to get actual good food for a great price with a great ambiance when it opened but sadly that only lasted a few months and now its just like every other crappy buffett , not worth the price at all ... Sushi: dry, old Desserts: below average selection thats why they put a chocolate fountain that they never clean Everything else tasted like if they use the same recycled oil ... Dont waste your time unless they make improvements some people just like garbage food."}
{"text":"There is a good selection of food choices. I like getting the crab legs on the weekend. Not too pricey..."}
{"text":"Do not go here your gut will regret it, and don't ever pay attention to the sign that says open till ten cause they shut everything down and there is no food remade past 9. So this place just sucks all the way around. And they hover over you like are you done yet every ten min trying to conveyer belt the next people. It's customer service is like a mean mother in lws house who hates you but serves you dinner cause they have to for their child. It's about as comfortable as a colonoscopy. Boom! Stay away. True story guys"}
{"text":"Imma go ahead and just give this place five stars. I didn't get bad service like others have stated. I mean, they cleaned our tables for us and took our plates promptly. That's all that matters.   This place is exactly like Buffet @ Asia. The food and quality of it, and the price. BUTTTTT Hibachi Grill has crab legs, dimsum AND RAW OYSTERS!  So, if you is hangry, go here. Worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"A sign on the building indicates the Hibachi is permanently closed. The space will reopen as a different Chinese buffet on 15 September 2012."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried this place after seeing an advertisement with a coupon for 20% off.  It's quite a distance from where we live, but we made the drive for their lunch buffet.  When you walk in the door you go up to the counter and pay.  When we presented the coupon the lady said \"This isn't ours\".  We told her, \"It says Hibachi Grill on the coupon\".  Another employee looked at it and said it was right, so we received the discount. After getting another coupon from a publication we took two relatives to their dinner buffet.  This time we presented the complete advertisement that included the coupon to hopefully prevent the same situation from happening again. This time the lady said, \"This coupon is expired!\"  We said it's not.  She looked at it again and said, \"Oh OK it's the last day\" and grudgingly gave us the discount.  Unbelievable!!  Why send out coupons or advertise if you're going to argue with customers when they try to use them?  After both of these discussions we were sick to our stomachs before we got to the buffet line. We made a trip to the Men & Women bathrooms to wash our hands before eating. That was another adventure.  Both bathrooms were dirty with toilet paper & paper towels scattered everywhere. Granted a lot of it is from the customers being messy, but they need to do a better job of cleaning them. The only reasons this place is pulling out a 3 Star review is the food variety & taste, price (which included drinks), prompt/polite waiter, and the décor/atmosphere. They need to do a better job of cleaning up spills on the buffet line & changing the serving spoons/tongs.  This is especially true in the dessert area where the tongs looked pretty gross.  You could see pieces of the different desserts on the ends of the tongs from people grabbing different items. We felt like we were getting three or four desserts in one.  Pretty yucky!"}
{"text":"This buffet is average but the grill is well worth the visit. The gentleman at the grill is quiet but very polite. Try it at least once. We drive about 35 miles there just for the grill. The bar is keep stocked and the restaurant is clean, good service."}
{"text":"Dear Hibachi; please come back! We miss you. Restaurant closed about Feb 7th, 2013. This was the best Hibachi out of all of them here in the Phoenix area. Great food all the way. Excellent selections to choose from. The a/c was cranking good in the hot summers. The wait staff were very attentive and polite. Very spacious. The price was right at 8 bucks a person including drink. I was very saddened to see it close. The management actually cared about you as a customer ; )"}
{"text":"Hibachi is temporarily closed for one month. I can't wait till they a re-open. 115 degree days and a $2 - $3 thousand dollar electric bill for a/c in August might have something to do with it. I can't blame them. Why work for nothing when they can go on vacation for a month to see family. Probably will re-open Sept 1 st. Come back my beautiful waitresses and food!"}
{"text":"This is a good buffet, especially for the price. But as a die hard fan of sushi... There is certain things you NEVER put in sushi. Number one... bananas. number two... breaded chicken... ??? Other than that... I like this buffet. I'm rating this four stars because it's my fault for being willing to eat sushi at a buffet. Lol"}
{"text":"Chinese food in Phoenix  is getting an even worse rap from many of these huge buffets serving bland, tasteless, horrible food that passes for Chinese!  This place is now called Super Moon Buffet but the food remains the same boring, tasteless, fare. I can't go back and waste money there....not when there several Thai and Vietnamese restaurants nearby serving the freshest and most flavorful food around! Will the owners of this buffet please stop the charade??"}
{"text":"This place was outstanding,so many things to choose from,I was like a kid at a candy store....the out side looked a little beat down tho,but they play great Music,definitely coming back and recommend this place"}
{"text":"quit going here to eat. food is below average. service is ok sometimes. restroom is gross. smells terrible. dirty. slow to refill crablegs. never going back."}
{"text":"My friends invited me to this place on a Friday night. My first impression with this place is that dinner was only $8.99, much cheaper than other places that I tried, which were usually above $20. I was a little worried that the food would be terrible. However, it is actually pretty good, not excellent but very fair for the price. Some hot menu that I really like are:  - Hot crawfish: small, not very spicy, not bad at all;  - Snail: big, sweet, and fresh;  - Frog legs: crunch and tasty. The waiter did not actively collect our dirty dishes on the table. But that's not a big problem to me. Overall, I enjoyed the food there. It is not the best, but for less than $10 for dinner, you cannot find a better buffet place."}
{"text":"I had better, nothing the extra ordinary... its just like any other buffets, same flavor same dishes. I did have some good sushi, but a lot to choose from and same chinese dishes but like i say just a regular buffet restaurant.  try it out you be the judge of this place."}
{"text":"We both like coming here for different reasons.  I like crab legs and anna likes sushi.  Today everything was terrible.  Service is getting worse every time we come in. Buffet is never full. No one listens.  Food is going down hill"}
{"text":"First time eating here last year was great everything fresh and tasty and clean, second time around a whole new experience food taste like left overs the place was a bitt messy and for the restrooms they were very gross clogged toilets,  t.p. everywhere and hardly any hand soap. My wife and i both and upset stomachs instantly after leaving. Only good thing was our waiter was really nice and if its you birthday you eat free ( but then pay for it with the sh*tz later)"}
{"text":"It was a good $10 for Lunch. Seafood is good here as well as the fruits and deserts..the hibachi station is worth trying. But I'm not excited about it"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese buffets I've been to in a while. The food was hot, the inside of the restaurant was in immaculate condition and the staff was incredible! Our waiter kept our drinks filled and never left plates on the table. I would recommend this buffet to anyone who enjoys chinese food.   I would also like to state that my girlfriend and I ate around lunchtime on Saturday. Both of us ate and had beverages for less than $20.   Lunch is until 3:30 and the price was around $7.00 a person. Dinner was after 3:30 and was closer to $10 a person. Im not sure if this is on weekends or all week.   I hope you enjoy! The pictures posted onto this listing are accurate."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail for a BOGO. Went last night with the G/F, place was busy for a Tuesday night. Has a wide variety and selection of food. The sushi station was filled in a lot of good looking items. Had a nice selection of both your traditional Chinese food and your American food as well. The crab legs are good a little soft but nice tasty and warm. The dessert section was also awesome had a good variety of all different types of desserts including fresh fruit. The wait staff there was terrific always attentive towards the customer and was able to clean the plates off in a timely manner. I would recommend this place if you're in North Las Vegas and want  an honest good buffet."}
{"text":"I called the restaurant and asked the host if drinks included with the meal both of them said yes and our server said yes as well. When I received the bill I had charges for drinks. So I went up to pay and ask the management  or the owners and ask them to remove the charges for the drinks because we were told they were included.  They said no so my wife went up and started disputing w the owners and she said the same thing to take off the drinks. The owner or management called the our server over and said he had to pay us the $10 dollars for the drinks they charged us. As being a server and a bartender for many years I thought it was really crappy that a owner or manager would try to make a employee pay that. So with that being said we will never set foot inside the establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Although the buffet wasn't totally spectacular plus it didn't seem like many people went here the grill was great. Their service was great, the restaurant is somewhat clean, all in all pretty decent."}
{"text":"This place left me confused when I thought to write my review. To start with, we walked into this place around 2 PM .Once we entered, a lady came by to take us to a table .Place is clean and they have a huge selection of food items which is really a solid point .Also for the price they are offering .  They have salad counter, Asian starters, main course  and a live grill with a pizza place along with sushi on the side. However they are few items good in taste and many are under salted and under seasoned . I must say one can find difficult to choose the stars when thoughts are tangled.  My stars go for the variety of food offered mainly. However I may visit this place as the location is most visited by us during weekends."}
{"text":"Dinner is a little pricier than most other buffets in the area. The menu is heavy on seafood little else to pick from. All sushi is eel or imitation crab. The standards are offered, chow mein, broccoli beef,etc but most is over cooked our had been sitting for too long. Add to this that all of the food is heavily layered in oil.  There are better choices in the area for less money."}
{"text":"Big menu and every item I tried tasted delicious. Octopus and stuffed shrimp were the best."}
{"text":"Rand H, and myself went here today for the grand opening lunch buffet . The food and lots of it was very good and the right temperature.Even the hard ice cream was not rock hard and easy to scoop. Most of the food here is the same as there other location.But they did not have the great cake you eat!! I had at Thomas and 75th ave.So  we have another great Chinese buffet in the valley to enjoy."}
{"text":"THIS SUPER BUFFET just made my favorite Chinese buffet anywhere list.The selection was bigger than any other buffet in Arizona and the food was great. Everything I ate was prepared and presented with care and that is something you should see at all buffets but do not.The service was fast and friendly and the decor was OK ,not as nice as 75th ave and Thomas location. So if your looking for a good Chinese buffet try this one because it is the best !!!!"}
{"text":"Well this Chinese buffet just might be my favorite. They have a wide array of food and everything i ate was real good. I started with a bowl of wonton soup and the wontons were packed with meat and very tasty then it was on to the hot foods and the excellent were the ribs,roast beef,beef pie,chicken wings, Polish sausage and the pork tenderloin. Then it was on to the sweets and they were good to, I had coconut cheesecake , fresh cut pineapple, real ice cream ,and some kind of pie that was really good but when I asked what it was all they could tell me was cake. when i asked what kind of cake they just said cake, but anyway what ever it was it was damn good. I really look forward to returning here this place rocks,"}
{"text":"I love the Hibachi's but this one dropped one star because I like the selection is  better at the other locations.Everything I had was good but I missed the ribs that they normally have. Another thing was the Chinese donuts were crunchy on the bottom. The service was good and and the decor was nice but the other Hibachi's are better."}
{"text":"I paid $11.99 to waste food. A lot of the different types of entree's had at least one thing wrong with them. It was either cold, flavorless, looked wrong, smelled wrong or just plain tasted wrong.   Even things like crab puffs, that are normally supposed to be fried and crispy, were so hard to bite into I actually thought I chipped my tooth. The only reason I got full from this place was because I was tasting a little bit of everything but nothing was so great that I kept going back for seconds. The crab meat and cream cheese sushi was good but honestly how can you mess up on that? Now about the other sushi Im not sure about because I didn't want to risk it. Besides that, not one thing that was made by them I enjoyed.  They had \"Water and Ice\" type ice cream that were in tubs and honestly was the only thing I can fully eat without having to waste besides the almond cookies (which were obviously not theirs also because they were still in plastic containers). I used my own clean spoon because they had a gross little sink that was feeding warm water to the ice cream scoopers and the water was murky.  I almost asked for my money back but I didn't want to be THAT PERSON. I still left a tip with the server because the server was actually really good with refilling drinks and removing plates, even though they had food. It's not their fault the food was bad. So please head my warning."}
{"text":"I don't ever expect to get good sushi at these types of restaurants, especially in AZ.  I do expect them to have OK level rolls. (At least on the level of other similarly priced Asian buffets.)   I usually ask the guy at the sushi bar to make me spicy tuna hand rolls.  At this place, the non-Asian guy (who couldn't speak English) manning the sushi bar didn't even know how to make them.  I hope he wasn't just refusing to make them for me.  Unacceptable.  Their salad bar is very above average.    The other food at the buffet is pretty good, especially for the price.  Their wait staff was pretty attentive.  They cleared plates and refilled drinks diligently."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, at least there was a grill, which was also sub par but at least edible."}
{"text":"We came here late since we just arrived in Phoenix but the owner/manager was very accommodating to tell us if we wanted anything in particular that he'd cook it especially. He even brought out fresh crab legs to our table. I can't give a complete review on the food since we were late but their service was really good! They had all the usual Chinese buffet dishes. The ice cream was above average though and was from Texas and packaged. If I'm ever in Phoenix again and in the mood for cheap Chinese buffet I'll consider coming again - at an earlier hour."}
{"text":"I went here for the Grand Opening and enjoyed my dining experience then. Since then, however, it seems to have fallen in quality a few notches. One thing  about this place is that it's huge - you could hold a Star Trek convention here. Put a little random food coloring on everything and call it Klingon cuisine. But I wasn't feeling it the last time I went. Both my dining companion and I felt that the drinks were a bit funny-tasting for starters. Flat. Blech.    They have ribeye steaks you can get cooked for you on the grill. That's a plus. A lot of the same things that Pacific Seafood Buffet has - escargot, frog legs, sushi. I didn't dare touch the sushi though - the coloring looked very OFF. It looked like somebody made pieces of fish out of playdoh or something. Something about the colors looked very wrong. When I see something like that, my food poisoning radar goes off and I won't go near it. Perhaps they just  colored some inferior fish species and got the coloring  wrong - I dunno. It just didn't look right.    I enjoyed the regular Chinese dishes - beef brocolli, egg rolls, chow mein, pizza (didn't Marco Polo bring that to China?), pot stickers, etc.   For dessert I usually get the green tea ice cream. This last time I decided to try the cheesecake. It was still  frozen! WTF! Why even bring it out if the damn thing is still solid frozen!! At least let it thaw a bit before bringing it out for people to dig into! After this last experience I'm  not sure if I would go back to this place..."}
{"text":"I came at 8:00 pm and every food tray was empty. So I asked the guy that does the cooking for two over easy eggs and the guy took the eggs that I gave him and put it back.  The ice cream door said \"ice cream take out 75 cents each\". I ask the guy and he said if you want to take it to go. Then I was like I get it. When I paid the bill the service was bad so I didn't tip. The server said I forgot the tip. I was like I didn't  tip based off of the bad service."}
{"text":"Like any other cheap Chinese buffet in Vegas, this would be a good place to get stuffed.  You just have to be patient and corralled the crab leg area to get some.  They don't replenish them right away and if you are not hanging out there before they do, you're SOL."}
{"text":"Very nice restauraunt. Good food we enjoy going out to eat here. Prices are reasonable good atmosphere"}
{"text":"OK, so I haven't been to a buffet in a long time.  When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.    Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.  I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve)."}
{"text":"eaten here several times , and it was really good, one time I went  there all the food was cold, and it was dinner hour. But the sushi is good, so I just stuck to that. The fresh fruit is really good,  I usually never eat it at a buffet, but this has been good every time."}
{"text":"This place sucked . if your a picky eater dont go here.  Its horrible. I called before heading over that i have a very picky eater.  I asked her if they had some fruit n pizza since that is all my son looks for  . she told me yes over the phone but when i got there they charge 44.95 n they didnt have any pizza like she said they had and can someone please tell me why the fruit tasted like someone had poured salt on them ? I asked her if she could refund me my money for him because he didnt like anything.  She said no. Not very please with this place we will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Buffet has all the typical offerings of your local Chinese buffet, I was disappointed at how MOST of the food was room temperature. The food that was supposed be hot was warm with the exception of the soups, they were piping hot. Maybe it was the time  of day that I came in because I heard good things about this restaurant.  I know the first time I was there (when it first opened, it was excellent. The food was hot and delicious). Not on my second and third trip there. I even tried their restaurant on 51st & Bell before they closed. That one was even worse than the one at Metro which is why it may no longer be in business. I don't know why I kept going back. Maybe the buffet looked so tempting and the restaurant was crowded I thought something isn't right or it must be me. I do know if you can catch the dishes as they come out of the kitchen  when they come out fresh they are very good.  But this place reminds me of all the other C - rated Chinese buffets in Phoenix. I'm generally not a fan of buffets and Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet is nothing special. it is typical of the buffets here, you get what you pay for but the food looks good and they have a lot of choices (a wide selection) so everyone will eventually find something they want to eat there if you can stomached warm - cold food that is supposed to be hot. But it is it's all you can eat.   The last time I went here with my wife I walked around the buffet once, walked around twice... and walked around one last time and NOTHING looked appetizing at all!  I ended up having soup because I could see the steam coming from it and knew it would be hot. .   We should've known better, judging from the demographics of the place.  I shouldn't have given them additional chances and just got the heck out!   CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Is average, they'll do their job like any other buffet restaurant. AMBIANCE: The buffet presentation is very basic, Once you walk in, one side has all the food and kitchen area, the other side is tables and chairs, and booths. FOOD: The food experience was just that- an 'experience. Frankly the health department should really come in and take a look at the food temperatures of the buffet. I am surprised people haven't got sick from food poisoning at this restaurant!  CONCLUSION: I'm writing out of disappointment for wasting $$ at this place. One star is way too generous, more like ZERO star."}
{"text":"Ill take this place over buffet at Asia any day. They offer more selection than what I'm used to seeing at other Asian eateries.  This place is clean, plenty of parking and I like the ambiance of the koi pond. As far as pricing is concerned, they're competitive price-wise."}
{"text":"Just arrived at Hibachi, waitress sat us down in a booth table. As soon as we sat down, a cockroach crawled onto the table. Should I report? Also seats are horrible, they're torn out and in bad condition. No comfort whatsoever. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"The Hibachi Grill is the best thing here.  Nothing like fresh stirfry when you are the author of it's ingredients.  The other selling point of this buffet is the bite size sushi that is offered. Most of the other items are above average.  Dumplings, Crab Angels, and Clams do stand out along with the mildly rude but sexy service.  For the $13.99 price tag you can't be to picky because it's still worth the price of admission.  Did I mention this buffet offers a very large variety of selections."}
{"text":"Now I have to say this is a pretty good place to dine or when your in the mood for Chinese food. All the times it has been... Well let's just say it wasn't perfect but still good. The food is delicious in my opinion. Music is calming. And bathrooms aren't doing too good. But I would recommend it. Edit: I forgot to add this part but know that I tried other types of sushi the sushi isn't really good the rice is really taffy like and I would recommend you trying the meat stand and the sauce in the yellow bottle."}
{"text":"Our first experience was pretty positive except for the price tag but hey, it's all you can eat for dinner, so that seemed worth it. We decided to go back for lunch today since they advertised $6.99/person. Apparently that's everyday BUT Sunday. We had our 2 year old with us and didn't really want to put him back in the car and figure out another plan so we paid the $9.99/person and were seated by the hostess. Our waiter was nice but not really on top of our drinks or clearing plates. The food was bland and most of the the meat had a bunch of gristle and fat. We thought maybe we just needed to try some different things but it was ALL like that. We left feeling pretty cheated money-wise and not at all satisfied that we'd had even a remotely decent lunch.   All that to say, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Bad food. Plenty of other buffet places to go to."}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill. Went opening week and it was descent enough to return. Long story short... we won't be returning for their bland, tasteless food that has been sitting out for hours or the filthy booths. Best to be avoided IMHO.  * The owner also has chosen illegal blocking of a handicapped parking place with a orange cone in front of their business and should be reported to the City of Las Vegas.

{"text":"This was my 3rd time eating at this restaurant. First two times were much better than last night. Many tables were not cleared of previous diners plates. Floor was extremely dirty, not just crumbs but actual pieces of food. Not many of the dishes were labeled so it was a lot of mystery food. I grabbed a fried frog leg and had to spit it into my napkin when I figured out what it was. Never would have taken it had I known. Sushi was awful this time. Just no flavor at all. There were no knives at all in the restaurant. We looked in all the utensil holders...only spoons and forks. Staff never came back to ask if we needed refills on drinks. Just not a good experience this time. Not sure if I will ever go back."}
{"text":"This place was a lot better then i expected! Theres a good amount of food for the price.There is also a good variety of deserts/sushi/fruits. They also have sea food which is a plus. The waitress was super nice, she would always check on us. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Large selection of food, spacious dining area, attentive waitstaff. For an all-you-can-eat buffet, the quality of the food is OK to good, although nothing is outstanding. I really like their prime rib, though; while even this wouldn't get a stellar rating from me, it's pretty good for something offered by a buffet restaurant. I would consider this a 3 or 3.5-star establishment, but I'm bumping it up to 4 stars because of their 50% off take-out after 9 p.m. -- this is how I often get a huge take-home meal, sometimes with leftovers for the next day, for a really low price. Quite the deal!"}
{"text":"Another excellent buffet destination ... thanks, Rand, for organizing the gastronomic excursion! http://www.yelp.com/user_photos?userid=FOmaE6lFWFri8AQUbYTyvg&return_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DFOmaE6lFWFri8AQUbYTyvg&select=X_uFc1NJPF29fIHS0P-7uw This is one of the larger buffets in Phoenix and I find it to be among the best ones. The restaurant is clean, well-lit at the serving area and more dimly (but still adequately) lit at the table and booth areas. There is a large array of mostly Chinese dishes plus sushi and hibachi stations, well-prepared food, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Monday night for dinner, the main draw for us was the steamed crab legs. It was about the best item I had. The shrimp plate with veggies was second. Other items were hit and miss baked pork chop tasted good, also enjoyed the various pot stickers and crispy wontons. The chicken dishes could be better quality. There are some sushi options, I'm still new to eating sushi so the one I picked was not to my liking.  The staff seemed a bit distracted, overall nice but needs to pay better attention to guests.  I would give a second try, maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"what is it about Mexicans and screaming kids at a buffet, God a mighty can't a grown man overeat bad food in peace"}
{"text":":(. this was my second and last visit to this buffet. we came here a couple months ago, at about an hour or so before they close, it was pretty much empty and some things were out or shut down. we had some sushi and I had crab legs, husband had the Mongolian bbq. we liked it. it was decent. I crave sushi and crab legs often they are my favorite so we thought this place was cool for budget friendly seafood. for both of us to eat here cost about as much as one of us at our regular ayce sushi place or strip buffet with crab legs. that's why we came back today. I got off work at 3 and we went for an early dinner. we left hungry and I honestly wish I could have my money back. I feel like I threw it away. I never want my money back for anything, but I am not satisfied at all. the sushi wax ok, they have a pretty good selection. they had a fried roll, but it was really hard from sitting under the heat lamps. it's ok  sushi I guess. think grocery store California roll. I've seen fancier rolls at albertsons though for sure. the drab legs were out for most of our time there, and they disapeared in seconds after being put out. they did have oysters, I don't eat oysters but they have them. and fried soft she'll crab, I think and craw fish and lots of Chinese food. I finally did get crab legs but I swear some of them were empty. I dunno how that happens or what that's about, but there was very very little meat in them. it's all this work and mess with the cracking and everything for just the tiniest bit of meat. maybe I'm being too harsh with the one star I have for them right now....... maybe ill make it 2 stars. I'm just so unsatisfied and it bums me out. I don't understand how at 8:30ish  almost closing time was better then 4pm and they have people, like prime time. their bathrooms are awesome, like they look cool. I took so e pics I'll post later. . I'll give them 2 stars cuz the first time made me come back. this time made me never come back lol. I mean, they have food, it didn't kill me ( although I don't feel very great, a lil quesy) they have all sorts of seafood things. there's just too much competition. my bookmark list is a mile long so I can't see coming back to a place that I don't love. I wanna be excited about a restaurant, I don't wanna eat at just any old place that's cheap. like I love the buffet at bellagio. LOVE IT!!!  yes, it's  more expensive and we don't get to go there often, but I crave  it and when I am there I enjoy myself and I can't wait to come back. this place does not do that to me."}
{"text":"I was craving crab legs and my co worker told me about this place. Best crab legs hands down I ever had in Las Vegas! I went on a Friday night pretty busy so they kept replenishing!  I heard if you go on a slow day they don't replenish fast. My boyfriend told our waiter/bus boy his sweet and sour chicken was cold. He said ok, not even 10 minutes later he brought a place a fresh sweet and sour chicken to our table and apologized about the inconvenience.  Talk about customer service!!! I gave it 4 stars because they need to clean up the buffet a little when people spill things, other then that I'll be back and I will spread the word!"}
{"text":"I am still surprised, but this is by far one of the best Chinese buffets I've dined in.  I've been to many buffets and each and every one has been disappointing compared to this one.  My father and I always joke about how pitiful other restaurants are in comparison with this one."}
{"text":"First time visiting and ... Whoa scary... About the best I can say. Exceptionally unclean, waiting for a new super bacteria to develop here, yeesh.  The place was crowded as to be expected at around 5pm.   We sat for about 20 min at a sticky, unwashed table with food caked on the napkin dispenser, sriracha bottle and soy sauce, watching the dozen or so little kids running around picking up the food with their bare hands and tossing it back into the pans. We saw a couple kids licking and tasting pieces of cake on the dessert table and put it back on the tray, another kid was grabbing french fries and tossing them and yet another one was shoulder deep in the ice cream bins.   Not one adult attempted to stop them, including employees.   Besides that, most of the food was cold, luke warm at best. The sushi looked appetizing right up until you saw what the tongs looked like that you were supposed to use to pick it up with. They were caked with layers of gook and old food.   We watched an employee pick out what looked like rotted vegetables from a dish and push the rest aside. Another employee was putting more food in one of the trays and coughed right into the food, didn't even turn his head.   At this point we did not even bother to try to eat the one plate we had gotten and left.   We went to the register, told the older lady behind the counter that we were pretty upset about all the little kids playing in the food and couldn't eat. She quickly barked something to one of the waiters, who ran up with a bill, and then she said $25.93. Nothing more. We stared at each other, shrugged, paid and used a lot of hand sanitizer from the dispenser on the wall by the entrance on the way out.  We are hoping the couple bites we did take don't make us sick. We will never, ever attempt to go back there.  This is where the eventual zombie outbreak will occur (haha)..  Yuck."}
{"text":"Best Hibachi and Chinese style restaurant around. I have been coming here since they opened. The food has always been very consistent. The best for me is the Hibachi grill where you pick your veggies and meats and the guy cooks it in front of you while you wait. He has been there for years and has it down to a science. The buffet and sushi bars are great also. They have a nice ice cream bar as well for dessert if you have room. I moved as far as 45 min away and still made the drive because it's that good. The only thing that needs improvement in my opinion is some of the wait staff are rude. One waitress in particular gets very annoyed if you ask for a drink after a few times. If I spend my money I will eat and drink for as long as I want until I get my belly full so get over it. The bathrooms could use some work also with getting rid of graffiti on bathroom stalls. The food is that good that is why I come back. They also have a Spot On machine where you get discounts after so many visits which is a nice perk."}
{"text":"For the people that said this was a huge place...well its not. The sushi bar was tiny and not really tasty at all. The other foods were great including the ice cream which had only 6 flavors available. Service was perfect but I just can't go past the fact that people actually thought this place was huge. Ichiban Supreme buffet in Greensboro is much much bigger and has a large sushi bar."}
{"text":"If you want to eat crab legs for dinner, forget this place, their crab legs are a joke, we were there today for dinner time and they toke 45 minutes to come with about 20 very tiny legs and they disappeared in 10 seconds. On my the picture you can see what they keep on their buffet for 45 minutes. For the same price you can eat great crab legs at Kirin or buffet at asia . I will never come back here!  Their mongolian grill is good, so I will give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Ok food. Service suffers a lot and I don't like my tip automatically added to my bill.  Price is a little high."}
{"text":"The food was decent though it was room temperature which was disappointing.  I could deal with it though.  What turned me off is they charged my 11yr old son as an adult and when we said something about it the cashier she didn't seem to care.  Right there I had already decided not to go back.  Another thing that I didn't like and found very tacky is the lady filling our drinks all of sudden showed up right at the counter beside my wife I guess waiting for her to write in a tip which wasn't happening.  First of all it's a buffet and you serve yourself so I had no intention of tipping anyway.  As I said I was very disappointed and will not return.  Guess I'll stick to Golden Corral."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for 15% of our meal price so my wife and I went here after church. This buffet has its hits and misses. The hits: rib roast, orange chicken, baked mussels, clams, and CRAB LEGS. The misses: all the canned fruit in their syrup baths, bought in desserts, and soggy french fries. There's also a grill station where you choose your vegetables, meat, and sauces and have the chef stir fry them for you. My wife and I didn't try it as its very common in Vegas. Their buffet costs around $15 on Sundays. I would give it a passing grade as their seafood dishes tasted pretty good here. Note: When i presented my coupon to the chinese cashier lady, I saw her roll her eyes at me. :P"}
{"text":"Awful greasy food. Flavorless (aside from the oil) and cold. Not to mention the ridiculous signs promising a penalty for \"wasted food.\" I was not willing to compromise my health by eating food that tasted off and I most definitely was not going to pay extra. Instead of focusing on what patrons throw out, management would do well to make sure the food was good. Waste is generally not an issue unless the food sucks and this food was terrible."}
{"text":"I went here today with my family for lunch, We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of their buffet. While its not the best Chinese food I've ever had it was far from the worst. I particularly enjoyed their Hot and sour soup and Black Pepper Chicken. We'll be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night where there were less people. Hibachi grill was delicious and the buffet fair was good. Good overall as far as buffets go. A lot of food for $10 per person plus $2 for a drink.  Recommend going in on off nights when there is less screaming children and more room to navigate."}
{"text":"There is nothing supreme about this place!  Carpets are old dirty and smelled of urine. Food just straight out sucked. The woman did not want to put out more beef and broccoli when asked to do so, she insisted there was some there, I had to point out to her that there was no beef in the beef and broccoli. When it finally did come out, the meat did not taste like beef at all nor did it look it. I mainly ate the noodles whereas I felt that was the safest. What a waste of $12.99! Never to return again!"}
{"text":"Don't go there. I don't like buffets (I went because my friend's son wanted to go there to celebrate his birthday), and this one reminded me why! I grabbed a plate and it was so greasy at the bottom. The floors were dirty as were many of the tables (this is on a Wednesday night and it was not busy!). One of the waiters sat across from us to eat lunch. He has crab legs, took a bite and spit out the shell to his plate. He stopped eating, grabbed a towel and went to wipe a table. He then went back to his table and never washed his hands. I will not be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Good first time. Then it became less and less fresh. Noodles and most dishes are bland. And even the damn restroom sign is spelled \"resteroom\""}
{"text":"Some food was ok but most wasnt very good. The server we had came by the table occasionally but didnt speak. Wierd service and forgetable food."}
{"text":"First and last time. Food wasn't good at all. To say the least, even the ice cream out of the the ice cream machine was bad."}
{"text":"Thing is with chinese buffets, there are far more dishes than you can or even should eat.  You can't taste em all and when you're through trying, you've overdosed on all the wrong things and look like a snake that swallowed a basketball. Food here was ordinary (good).  There were 14 food islands with more dishes than anyone could ever sample at one time....still the same can be said about all chinese buffets that I'm acquainted with.  There is also a shushi bar and a mongolion bbq which they call Hibachi bar.   Because it's new, it's decorated nicely. Oh, I didn't mention that while I was eating, I pulled a long maybe 10 inch strand of someone's hair out of one of the foods piled on my plate. I am giving this a three star rateing but at the same time, I wouldn't go too far out of my way to eat there again.  This was the first time.  An exploration, if you will."}
{"text":"Bumped up a star, I've adopted a \"paleo\" style diet to compliment some Crossfit training and this place has been my go-to for when I'm in the need of large quantities of meats and veggies.  I hit up the grill portion for the first time and I honestly could have/should have just stuck with that, but I went above and beyond on the some other meaty selections (avoiding anything breaded or excessively sauced).  While there are still items that look a little sketchy, I have no problem filling up on the items that look appetizing to me..."}
{"text":"About $10 per person. I ate so much that I felt bloated (not there fault, mine). They have a lot of variety and have tasty honey chicken. All you need and expect from a Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Food was alright nothing surprising but when they sat us down there was a group of people sitting right next to us that had a rabbit and were petting it on the table . So that pretty much did it for me. The fact that they would allow an animal in there, much less put it on the table is disgusting and unsanitary."}
{"text":"Outstanding chinese buffet AND Hibachi grill combination family oriented restaurant. The individual dishes range from very VERY good to quite excellent. The grill selection food is quite varied with plenty of vegetable & meat selections. I chose every vegetable & large portions of each of the meats to grill together. There are dozens of the prepared chinese dishes and \"american\" food too. The salad bar is extensive, fresh, & excellent. The sushi is also quite outstanding. The extensive number of deserts is really amazing. The server personnel are helpful and enthusiastic without being overbearing. The pricing is reasonable too with lunch about $8-10 & dinner about $11-14.  WELL DONE HIBACHI GRILL!!"}
{"text":"The Hibachi grill was okay, very bland seemed more like a Mongolian grill~even the Fiesta has better a Mongolian grill than this place and only $7! The food was okay mostly bland, the dessert selections were okay, not fresh seemed like it came from the freezer. at $15 dollars a person I will not be returning, definitely overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place had TONS of great looking food!  I ran straight to the Sushi to start, & it was slammin'!  I liked everything I ate, & it will take me a few visits to get to everything that I wanted to try.  The place was clean, all the food looked fresh, & I WILL be going back again!"}
{"text":"Went right before closing on a Wednesday night. Services was fantastic, food was great.... there were only 3 other tables with patrons. So I wonder if that has something to do with consistency. They served SASHIMI on the line. I do not think I have ever seen that at a buffet before. Also they had a spicy shrimp soup that hubby LOVED. There was so much to try, I ate mostly sushi. I didn't have any desserts, try the grill, or the salad bar. Hubby ate 6 plates of food. And the owner came over to ask if we wanted anything else before they started cleaning.  I am telling everyone I know! Glad we got the opening coupon in the mail. Well worth $30 for 3 people for dinner. Hubby wants to try lunch tomorrow, so we shall see if it's the same quality."}
{"text":"A lot of grease and no flavor  And I found dirt on my watermelon  Point is you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"After waiting patiently for this place to open, when they finally did me and my fiancee went out to dinner with a few friends. I did not like the lay out of the place at all, as previous reviewers touched upon, it is one line and things get congested too easily. It makes for an unpleasant visit when you are heading to the buffet.  The food itself was decent quality, by buffet standards, they have the basics, seafood, basic american cuisine like chicken nuggets, pizza, sushi, and other asian cuisine like sweet N sour items, orange chicken, etc. The sushi was quite bland, the salad bar was pretty terrible, the lettuce was quite limp, and the main courses were nothing that stood out. Usually when I go to a buffet there is one or two items that I'd find above average, but here I cannot really think of anything that went beyond the average column.   If I were to give this business advice, it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down, and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality. Most chinese buffets I've been too have had a salmon dish, there was none to be found here, the only fish dishes I found were a grilled fish (which was not edible, it tasted disgusting and bland) and deep fried Tilapia which was extremely bony. Just one example of the poor variety they have here.  I will give the place another shot, perhaps it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet with awesome variety.  I was here on a Tuesday night and it appears they had just opened.  The location looks very new with shiny new plates and silverwares.  The appearance and cleanliness of the place is very good, cause its new I guess.  The dinner buffet was $10.  which is pretty standard for a buffet dinner.  I was however not expecting anything special like oysters or stuff.    Suprisingly, its like a Pacific buffet, with a sushi bar, fresh oysters, variety of ice cream-green tea even, about 8 stations full of food.  Pacific only has about 5.  But this place have 8 stations full of different varieties.  I like that they have a very good mix of american and chinese american food.  From fried bananas to roast beef to broccoli beef to fried rice to string beans to a full salad bar and a full dessert bar, u name it, they got it.   But here's the kicker, I really like that they have a very fresh and clean mongolian grill area, where u go over and pick and mix your own plate of noodles and meat and they chef it up for u.  This place has noodles, beef, pork, shrimp, several vegetables and such.  But Their biggest surprise is, they have Ribeye steak.  Yes raw Ribeye steak right there for U to pick and place on your plate for them to stir fry along with your mix.  That was really impressive I thought, such a nice piece of meat that would have suffice as a main course itself at most dinner places, now U can add it to your grill plate and they would cook it any way u want it.  Its very far away from where I live but U can bet I will be looking out for other Hibachi Buffets.  I hear they have one on the I-17 and my buddy who lives in Mesa claims they got a new one opening out where he lives on Alma School and Southern.  I am not sure if they are all the same but U know I will be checking that branch out to confirm is the same chain :)  Meanwhile if U live in Peoria, U lucky Bastard !  Go there and fill yourself up for 10 bucks.     Oh, one little thing that did not mar my experience enough to give a lower rating, was there seems to be too many staff or maybe its cause they just opened, they were hanging around in groups and chatting and disappearing in groups to the back area to laugh and joke.  They were making a little too much noise and having a little too much fun, and not refilling my ice tea fast enough !  But, the manager came around a couple times to check on everybody, and that does help keep them on their toes a little bit."}
{"text":"I went there today with my kids.  We were a little late for lunch , so we paid dinner price.  This place is clean clean clean!  Brand new!  As for the food,  it was okay .   They had many selections like sushi,steaks,egg roll,  fish and all the other stuff you can find in a regular buffet . Taste was okay , nothing great.  Bottom line,  too expensive for me,   we were charged 35 bucks ,including taxes and  soda.     The kids probably ate 5 bucks worth of food."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!     Five star for this place?    Five star for  the look. It looks good with many buffet table but. All long trays.    I donno how the other  guy get 140 items.   I counted 100 with the sauce and raisin pickles thing like that.     Food not tasty at all.      They are busy because they did lots of   advertisement    People are trying it out And the waiters,they expect a big tips just for taking the plates Ice cream nasty! All long trays.     With drinks is 12 buck!! Not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Not the best service, it was quit busy, but service was slow. We waited about 5 minutes after being seated to give our drink order.   The food, I was skeptical about eating from the actual hibachi area since the meat was just out in the open, but my friend had it and it was good. A lot of the food didn't have much flavor, some of it was cold, and the sushi was all almost the same just made differently. The deserts were ok, same as all Chinese food buffets. One weird thing was the pineapple. We weren't sure if it was supposed to be like that, but it had salt on it or at least tasted salty which was really weird."}
{"text":"Didn't bother to go inside was so dirty and nasty looking on the outside.. where do these ppl get their reviews"}
{"text":"They deserve LESS THAN 0. Awful customer service and they don't actually close at 10. Apparently, they close at 9pm and decide to let whatever little bits of food that's left for the last hour of \"business\" dwindle away rather than restocking for hungry customers. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PATRONS."}
{"text":"We went there at lunchtime.  It was pretty good.  Kind of expensive for a lunch buffet.  Some of the food labels were wrong.  The worst thing was a Chinese donut.  That is what it was labeled as but didn't at all taste like a Chinese donut, and I have no idea what it was.  It was gross and I had to eat something else to get the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is very huge and was one of the cleaner buffets that I have been to.  They had plenty of selections but alot of it was just repetitive.  This buffet was nothing special and I will not be returning.  We only tried it out because it was $7.99 for adults and $3.99 for children under six years old.  Plus, my brother really hyped this place up.  Price does not include beverage which is an additional $1.59.  Water is free.  This is a special promotion going on so prices are subject to change.  None of the food really hit the spot but the one highlight for me was they had plenty of fruit ( Fresh Fruit ) and plenty of desserts.  These two areas combined were probably half of the entire buffet ( Seriously ).  They had one small salad bar ( Too small ) but enough to make a decent salad.  Too many people trying to get food at the same time.  The place is too big.  Too many kids running around.  There needs to be an ordering way to getting food.    For Example:  Line Starts Here.  Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet does not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"It is like taking a trip to a B rated Vegas buffet with out leaving phoenix!  A fancy black slate entrance and fountain lead you in to a dining area complete with fiber optic lamps and a giant one sided buffet.  The organisation of items is weird with Desert sushi more desert then back to normal food.  The sushi is mostly stuff with Krab, there is a wide range of items all the usual's including a few good veggie options, and stuff for the kids like pizza french fries and chicken nuggets.   One down side is the lack of accurate labels, this makes it hard to guess what is veggie and what is not.  Quality was decent service on drinks was great and for a 6.99 lunch we were all pretty happy.   It is easy to split a check here and they have large tables making it a good setting for a large group."}
{"text":"I was very impressed as I walked in. They have a nice little koi pond! Very clean and spaciousness seating area. It's really beautiful for an East Side buffet. They have a wide variety of food to choose from. From salad to sushi! The food is very delicious. At lunch before 3:45 it's $10 for adults. Children above 42 inches are half price. Children under 42 inches are free! So that was great! Only payed $24 for two adults and 3 children!"}
{"text":"Not to shabby. The hibachi grill is your best bet for this buffet. You have a nice selection to choose from and you can have as much of it as you want. Plus it is made fresh to order. SCORE! The sushi is also made fresh, but on the buffet, some of the dishes seemed to have sat for a little too long as they had that  \"I have been out for a long time and no one has refreshed me\" look. So be advised, go for some from Hibachi, sushi oh and ice cream. Be a little leery of some of the buffet items. If it looks like it has sat too long, it probably has. If in doubt go for the fresher items. You will be able to tell the difference."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we read the reviews about this restaurant before we went and honestly if it wasn't for the special  anniversary dinnner for my in-laws that we were attending there we would not have even tried it. But since we HAD to go this is our review;  We decided to go in with an open mind and not let the reviews we read tarnish our opinon of the place and let the food do the talking. When we walked in the decor is beautiful and there is a tropical waterfall and pond with gold fish swimming in it. Our spirits were lifted as we now had hopes of a delcious meal. We were severely let down and disappointed. We have been to several asian buffets and this one is by far the worst we have ever been to.  We were a large group of about 30 people and we were in their large \"party room\".   Service: Not good. They had only 1-2 wait staff that did not understand much English and it took forever to get drinks refilled and our used plates picked up. They would come in about every 30 minutes to pick up the dirty plates and would not refill drinks until after ALL the plates were picked up.  Food: Not good. They did have a number of different things to chose from but most of it did not taste good. We kept trying different things hoping to find something edible for the $10 a person we paid (plus the cost of our drinks) but we didn't. As a matter of fact my wife became sick and one other person did not feel good after eating their food.   They have a number of different flavors of frozen ice cream in a freezer like the kind Baskin Robins uses so you have to reach in and dip your own ice cream out. So now you have 100's of different hands reaching in to get their ice cream. I LOVE ice cream but there was NO WAY I was going to eat it after all the kids and people reaching in there to dish out their ice cream. They use only one ice cream scoop for all of the different ice creams and no one was washing their hands. Thats just nasty and unsafe!!   For people allergic to tree nuts it is dangerous to be using the same scoop for all ice creams since some ice creams have nuts in them. Plus we heard from others in our group that were brave enough to try the ice cream that it was hard as a rock and almost impossible to scoop out.   Some of our group were noting even eating or not eating much and planned on going somewhere else to eat dinner after the party.  Cleanliness: Good. We were satisfied with the cleanliness of the restaurant but not enough to make us go back for food we won't eat."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of asian buffets but my mother wanted to try this place, it just opened near our house.   Upon arriving, it seemed like a pretty clean place unlike a lot of buffets near our home. There's even a soothing little man made pond/fountain to the right once you walk in. The decor was pleasant on the eyes.   It's pretty cheap price. We came on a Sunday for dinner which was roughly about 14$. It seemed pretty busy but got seated right away. I was surprised by how much food they had. They even had crab legs and crawfish that night! For the price of 14$ you can get AYCE crabs? I think that's quite a steal.   I rated this place 2 stars because unfortunately the crabs was all that was appealing to me. The other foods all seemed bland and no flavor. The food looked like it was sitting there for a bit. The sushi I tried was all rice no fish in it.. And I'm not exaggerating, there literally was NO fish in it! One sushi I tried tasted like the fish they used was canned tuna.. YES, canned tuna! There was a place where you can pick veggies you wanted and the chef would satay it for you which I thought was pretty cool.   My water didn't get refilled not once while I was there. The empty plates did get picked up right away. We only saw our server once and that was to bring out our waters. It's a buffet so I never expect to see the server a lot BUT at least check on our waters or see how we're doing.  Probably won't be returning. I think my mom liked the place. Unfortunately I wish I can say the same for my myself, but I can't."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for this new buffet in town!!. The place, food, service, price, and location is totally great! My  family & friends love it here!. Also, you may book a party or any special event here too! The place is very spacious n nice. Love it!!"}
{"text":"There is sooooo much food here, so come very, VERY hungry! And that was only lunch! We were told at the cashier's desk that there is more food at dinner time. We arrived at about 3:30 PM and lunch ends at 3:45 PM, so we were just in time for lunch. Thank goodness, since I can't eat that much anyway, so it would be a moot point for me to have even more food in the buffet lines (there are 6 food lines jam packed with delights).   Lunch is $9.24 and dinner is $13.85 -- and I would say that it is well worth the price considering the amounts and variety of foods provided. They even have a self-serve yogurt area and a special section for desserts. There's a special area for sushi and hibachi selections but I really was much too stuffed to try anything from that area. It doesn't take much to fill me up, so buffets always make money on me.  Everything I tried was so very delicious and if I had more room, I would have eaten more (not! don't want to gain too much!)  Seriously, be sure to come here ravenously hungry and you will be satiated not only in your tummy but also on your palate!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile sense my husband and I last came here and it hadn't improved. We use to come here allot but over a year ago we've noticed a difference in the flavor and quality of food. They are merging \" what we believe is Chinese food \" with Hispanic food. Today was the first time I seen sliced jalapeños with a Hispanic yellow rice. They also have elotes, pico de Gallo, jalapeños curados , and other Hispanic sides . Which is great but I come to a Chinese buffet to eat Chinese not side dishes I can get at home. This will be our last time coming here ."}
{"text":"I like to have lunch and dinner here. Good food and service. A buffet at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We go here about once a month. They have a nice selection of food including sushi and the Hibatchi grill. Bad things are it costs extra for crab legs and the bathrooms are gross! See the picture I added."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about trying this buffet because I didn't care for the food from the metro location but I asked the person at the hostess stand and she assured me that this buffet was under a different ownership.  Last week the food was really decent and a few things like the prime beef and the rib eye were surprisingly good. I really couldn't find anything wrong with the food last week with a small exception to the rockfish and was happy that it was decent but thought I needed to wait for a second visit since it's a buffet to do a Yelp review.  I don't know what the problem was last night but almost everything was a fail.  All the sushi had leathery fish, the fish was sort of dried out and like leather so I couldn't eat any because I thought I'd get sick. All the sushi fish was like that.  The rib eye was tasty last week but last night it had no flavor.   I tried to cut a piece of the one steak with the serrated knife but couldn't cut threw it so I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it.   So next I tried to eat the prime beef since it also was tasty last week but last night it wasn't the same and I couldn't eat that one either.  The salmon was awful and I never tasted anything like that before, when you tried to eat it the fish turned to paste and liquified in your mouth and it didn't even seem like fish.  I tried to eat the spicy chicken since this one was really good but a little oily last week. Last night the spicy chicken was even oilier and didn't have the tasty sauce on it but it was spicy.  The chicken sticks were over fried so I couldn't eat them.  I don't know what they did to the chicken with broccoli but when you tried to eat the chicken it turned to a paste (just like the salmon did) and I found that not to my liking to say the very least THE VERY VERY LEAST.  Green beans were oily.  I tried the Hibachi Rice and maybe one or two spoonfuls were ok but then I hit something added that wasn't suppose to be in it and had to remove it from my mouth. I don't know what it was since it didn't even taste like food.  The rock fish was better than last week and tasted OK but I was only able to get a teaspoon's worth since it was just bones and skin left. Last week the rockfish was fishy tasting so I thought I just didn't like rockfish but now I think that one last week wasn't the freshest.  The Mongolian stir fry vegetables were good.  The fruit was good.  The cheese cake was frozen solid.  My husband wanted a refill on his soda and waited and waited and got up to get it himself. Our server had over thirteen tables and the server  from the next station over to her was complaining about not having any tables.  This was really one star to me but I am giving two stars since they are new and maybe were just having an off night or maybe this is just how they are now?"}
{"text":"You might feel differently than me about this one and I give two stars because the majority of what I tried I couldn't take more than a tiny taste and for sure not a second bite  also a few things had to be spit out . Of course I couldn't try everything so maybe I missed what was good but in all that I tried I say in general much of the food was very overly bland or mostly just not right .  The best things about my trip here were the service all the folks working were very attentive and the place seemed nice and clean . As for food the sushi I tried seemed fresh , I passed on the buttered rolls , onion rings and fries but they looked good also at the end I did have a little ice cream and I tried the cheese cake they were good .  Here we go....  Cucumber salad was fresh but had cheap Italian dressing poured over it . The Salmon had a strange what looked like crushed maraschino cherries on top it was so odd I had to taste it...(that was a spit out) so over cooked it tasted like very dry fishy chicken breast I couldn't figure out the red stuff) They had something marked prime beef it was cooked very tender but lacked any seasoning that it desperately needed or at least a au jus or gravy . The pan of spinach was half melted cheese so when you tried to eat spinach you just got melted mozzarella cheese . The breaded tilapia was very strong tasting of fish (a spit out) It was unmarked but the either orange chicken or generals chicken didn't taste like either . The spicy chicken was just sweet no spice . The green beans were just in thick sweet sauce . They had breaded mozzarella sticks that were cold and when you bit in to them it was like biting into rubber .  But the stir fry was the funniest thing and maybe they just purchased the wrong beef and had the grill on too low because we picked a beef stir fry and they cooked up your vegetables and threw the beef on the grill and we noticed it was taking an unusually long time and we left it just taking the stir fry that tasted OK not great but OK about the time we were almost done the stir fry they run the beef to us and you have no knife to cut it and it wasn't fork tender so my husband picked it up and tried to bite a piece off and nearly tore out his teeth trying to eat it...(well that had to be spit out . Lastly the steamed rice was hard and crunchy and wasn't holding up well on the buffet .  Maybe because they are new they just don't have it together yet but this by far isn't 4 or 5 star quality from what I tried ."}
{"text":"Not bad!!!! Crab legs was a little bland but wasn't the worst I ever tasted..everything else was average can't really complain because it is a cheap Buffett..but not completely disappointed to the point we felt ripped off..it was 7 adult and the rest kids  everybody kept getting up so I guess they thought we was leaving multiple times other than that great service refilling drinks and cleaning tables..we also got 15% off our bill!!"}
{"text":"Word of advice: Don't come here when you aren't hungry. Obvious, right? Well, after stuffing ourselves at the Jasmine Tokyo buffet for lunch, we were invited here by friends for dinner just 5 hours later. The selection here is IMMENSE, and the price is very reasonable.  Nothing tasted \"wow\" to me, but that might be because I wasn't hungry. But one big negative for me was that much of the \"hot\" food was not hot, or even warm. I didn't finish a piece of white fish because it was so cool that I thought it might be dangerous to eat. There were 4 soups, and the one I tried (hot and sour) was quite good and steaming hot. They have a Mongolian Grill -like station where you are guaranteed hot food, so that's a good choice (especially since you can also season it to your taste). Maybe it was an off night. I'm going to be generous and round up a 2.5 star rating to 3 stars, based solely on the price and selection."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for HIBACHI! Considering the deal, we will roll with the 4 instead of 3 stars. Unlimited crab for both me and the boyfriend for under $40. SCORE! I didn't walk in expecting huge, great quality crab, which is why it's easier to give this place the higher rating.   Even though I no longer live on the east side of Vegas, when a new food place pops up in my ol' hood, it sparks my interest. Somewhat hidden on the corner of Nellis and Stewart is The Hibachi Grill, and in an area of horrible Asian buffets, this place actually makes the cut!   Now first off, this is more of a buffet, with a grill station. With that being said, DO NOT SKIP THE GRILL STATION!! As a matter of fact, remember to bring a few extra singles so you can tip your grill master. It reminded me of a Mongolian stir fry. Add your raw ingredients, hand to chef, wait for chef to cook, and eat! This was personally my favorite area of the buffet. I had a nice skillet with more veggies than meat, just how I like it.   The buffet looked like a minimum of 50 items. This included sushi, shrimp in multiple forms, HOT crab legs, rice, noodles, a few Asian specialties, and even some chicken nuggets and fries for those picky kids. Overall, there wasn't anything that stood out amazing, and the salmon is very much skip-able. But, on that note, I could get full, on decent food, some fresh some canned, and be satisfied with my meal, as well as the price I paid for it. I am pretty sure every buffet has some of those items you pass on, and here I may pass on more than others. However there was enough good to make a return trip.   If you are seeking gourmet, go elsewhere. If you are seeking a decent price plate of shrimp or crab that you can bring the whole fam to, this is your place. A little something of everything."}
{"text":"Came here on my friend's birthday and the staff was sooooo nice! Lots of options at the buffet, and although it might not be for everyone, we all loved it! The waiter who took our drinks was so kind, he said \"I'm sorry we only have hot green tea\" to my friend when my friend ordered iced green tea. When he came back with drinks, my friend got a cup with green tea and a cup filled with ice! It was so nice of the waiter. When we were all at the dessert point, the restaurant started playing the \"happy birthday\" song over the speakers and brought my friend ice cream with a bunch of treats on it. So cute! We left in such a good mood and with full stomachs! Loved!"}
{"text":"They say open till 10, but the grill and sushi bar were torn down for the night. Where was at the counter offered me half off if I did take out. I said I wanted to sit down and he said well then it won't be half off. I cannot recommend this place"}
{"text":"GREAT BUFFET! Me, my family, and my friends were thinking of dining out either Buffet @ Asia or Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet. Since we ate Buffet @ Asia many times at the other locations, we decided to try this new buffet since we were near my friends' house. The buffet was great plus they had \"GRAND OPENING SPECIALS\" pricing, as well as including drinks.  There was tons of asian culture dishes out to choose from. The food was fabulous and good. The atmosphere inside the buffet was like you were in Asia plus they had river in front of the buffet. I would recommend my friends if they were around the area to try out this buffet."}
{"text":"I heard around that this place was better than the infamous \"Pacific Buffet\" (which I don't even like by the way). I was up and ready to try it, as I walked around the food islands. I wanted to leave. Food was dried up, sushi was not fresh.. We didn't leave because we've already drove so far for this place. I did not like anything but the fried rice I customized myself."}
{"text":"What happened to Habachi Grill & Buffet? We were there when they opened their doors and could not wait to pass on positive words to friends and family. Now, food is tasteless. We were asked twice for our drink order, but never got them.The restrooms are telling a story. No paper towels, no soap in the despensers, no toilet poop paper. You have to ask yourself. If the staff uses the restroom, how do they sanitize?"}
{"text":"Ate there today good food lots of seating and alway had my drink filled good desserts and like the place nice pond with beautiful koi fish not a bad price tried other buffets and got to say this one is my fave forgot to take pictures next time lol"}
{"text":"My wife and I came over here for Saturday lunch buffet.  First of all, the place is HUGE!  A bit different here, because we paid up front and were quickly taken to a booth and our drinks brought out.  $15 for both of us, very reasonable.  Second thing we noticed was how spotlessly clean the place appeared to be, which is always a good sign.  So we hit the buffet, which was quite extensive and had a great selection, so we tried a little bit of everything.  some of it was really good, some of it was ok, and some of it was not so good.  On the \"really really good\" side:  Stuffed mushrooms, salmon, orange chicken, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, crab cakes.  \"So-so\": beef brocolli, egg-drop soup, sushi,octopus, coconut shrimp.  \"Not so good\"; Eggrolls (wet and chewy), teriyaki chicken (too sweet!), grilled white fish (no flavor) and stuffed shrimp (funky and unidentifiable flavor).  The deserts were pretty good too.  Great selection of fresh fruit to choose from.  Overall, we liked the place and will make it part of our normal circle of restaurants."}
{"text":"First time visit. Great and plenty of food selections and quality. Complimented by prompt and courteous service. From the welcome to a Thank you for coming...thank you for a delicious experience."}
{"text":"So many type of food to choose from! I liked this place, it's new right on the northeast side of Vegas (Stewart & Nellis) located right next to CiCis pizza, well I loved the concept of having a hibachi hot kitchen area where you pick your ingredients and have someone cook it for you within minutes so Japanese! and their sushi made fresh right before your eyes also very delish. Like any other Asian buffet I chose this one because of their prompt and friendly customer service. This place keeps up with their cleanliness and food is never low. Taking in consideration that all over the northeast side of Vegas (Nellis blvd) has a variety of Asian buffets. Did I also mentioned that this place is huge! It's spacious and there's not a huge wait time to be seated at most you will be looking at 5-10 mins.  Don't forget to check out the koi fish! :)"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price - it cheaper than other buffets around. Can't beat the food - food choice double compare to buffets around and can be compared with some casino buffets. And it always have seats and never have line - even at busy weekends - because restaurant is HUGE, so when I & my son hungry and dont want to cook, I just go there with my kid, because I know, I don't need to wait. I dont like crabs or crowfish, or oysters, or octopuses, but my Mom does, and she sure happy to find all that here! My favorites is different suchi rolls, algae salad, aslo they have VERY good dumplings,  fried snow fish, different kind of shrimps, salmon, soups, DIY salad where I just add all I like-lettuce, tomatoes,  fresh bean sprouts, mushrooms & bell peppers, chiken wings, cole slaw, and for dessert fresh pineapple & melons, sweet vanilla rolls. Easy to feed the kid, too - I just walk with him around and put on his plate all what he like - tomatoes, tuna salad, shrimps, pizza, meatballs on the stick, brownies, chocolate mousse, tangerine pieces and pineapple tidbits, and, of course, frozen yoghurt... (: Staff usually very friendly,  even a kids-friendly, its a plus."}
{"text":"Let me just start off with how reasonable the princess are, $9 for lunch and $13 for dinner. They have a good selection on different Chinese favorite dishes. My favorite section is the Habachi grill where I made my own chow-mein full of veggies and shrimp. Our server was very sweet and attended. It is not  the best Chinese food place but for the price it was worth it. They serve crawfish, crab legs, oysters, muscles & honey walnut shrimp all of Le Boyfriends Faves."}
{"text":"I  really want to give this place 3 & 1/2 stars but since you can't give a 1/2 star,I'm rounding up to 4 stars.I had been wanting to go to this buffet for months but I could never find a person to go with.If you've read any of my other reviews,I've mentioned that I'm a non-driver and it's hard for me to get around.I live crosstown from this place and it's out of the way but today I decided to use the public transit system.I have really mixed feelings about this place.I had really high expectations and this buffet did not live up to them.I went for lunch and I'm guessing that dinner might have hve a better selection.The sushi selection was really limited.It's not like I didn't enjoy my meal;the food was adequate but I wish it could have been a bit better.They had a lot of items but they just weren't outstanding.I wish they could have had one really good shrimp dish(maybe dinner?) instead of peel and eat shrimp.They did have a salt and pepper shrimp dish but the flavor was not that great.They could have been a little faster in refilling the food.Service was adequate but not really friendly.I would rate this place as better than Lee's buffet(who isn't?) and Jumbo buffet,somewhat similar to Buffet Asia and not as good as my all time favorite,Krazy Buffet on Sahara and Cimarron.I would eat here again,maybe for dinner to see what additional items they have.You could definitely do worse than eating here,but you could do better,too. I probably won't come back here unless I get a ride from someone.But give it one try;you just might like it."}
{"text":"Stop now, & go somewhere else. We went here for dinner after reading prior reviews thinking that it would be a decent experience; we were wrong. As soon as we paid, sat down, & went around to look at our food choices we wanted to immediately ask for our money back. The quality of food looks like they either microwaved everything or just dropped items in the deep fryer.  It was 630pm (prime dinner time) & everything was picked over & sloppily put together You're better off going to Buffet of Asia-- sad excuse for a newly opened business."}
{"text":"I see that others have enjoyed this buffet and had good service and food. NOT THE CASE for this guy. W called to see what time was closing on a Sat. 10:30 is the time for closing and we arrived at 9:30. Here's what we experienced.... Upon entering the basically empty restaurant we were greeted and attempted to be seated at the only  booth in the restaurant that the pleather was torn up...not cracked...TORN UP! We opted for a table adjacent.  Upon approaching the buffet... 40% of the hot trays had little to no food on them. Of course those were the most popular things. There were 3 in our party to share what I would call leftovers. The \"Habachi\" , which is the namesake of the restaurant ,was closed down!!!. When we asked... they replied...oh sorry. The sushi bar was shutting down but to the insistance of my friend, another employee other than the hired sushi maker made him a roll. The original sushi guy refused! At 10pm they closed the ice cream station! At 10:15 they started VACUMMING on the other side of the restaurant but in our section!!! If they want to charge half price for a clean up crew from 9:30 to 10:30 fine. But if I call ahead this is not what I would expect...WTF!!! We received no good will for our inconvenience. What food we had was OK buffet food but for sure I will never be back and I will have already posted out to my FB about my experience.  A satisfied diner may mention to a few people about their experience....a dissatisfied diner tells everyone twice! If the owners are so confident that they will be busy...stop taking people at 8:30 and let them clean you out and graciously warn off later diners  I would have given NO STARS if they would have let me!!!"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  I like a joint with the parking lot full.  Always a good sign!!!!!  Like all the other reviews (Joseph L.), this place is clean and the employees are friendly and very good.   The price is decent for a large family.  I rate the buffet 4 star, the hibachi grill is 5 star.......... but sadly, their sushi just was not that good, therefore overall it is a 3 star."}
{"text":"MMy wife suggested we try this place instead of our regular Chinese buffet (Fugi's). Boy, was I disappointed! The girl at the cash register (you pay before you are seated) was more interested in an iPad than in taking our money). After being seated I headed for the buffet line and found the \"Habachi\"....oops! It was a flattop grill and a gas grill, no charcoal! Stir fry done on a flattop is not stirfry! Then on to the steam table...ALL the food was mediocre at best...bland and unseasonably. The sushi was horrible...tasted like the refrigerator. The salad bar had a minimum of items and the lettuce looked like it had been there all day. Although the price was $9.99,they did offer a 10% discount for seniors, which I asked for and then was charged the full price anyway. The waitstaff were aloof and could have cared less if we were even there. I for one will not go back and will gladly pay the $12 I usually pay at Fugi's for better quality!"}
{"text":"2/13/12:  I downgraded my rating from 5 to 3.... It wasn't as good the 2nd time there. Everything is so damn greesy!  Mandarin Buffett at Bethany Home & 15th Avenue is better.  This is really close to our house, on 7th Avenue & Osborne, right accross the street from Mi Patio... Dinner prices are $9.99 & it's all you can eat... Great selection, even 8 different kinds of ice cream for dessert, icluding green tea ice cream. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Buffet has many foods to choose from. Some of the foods were well worth the price of the buffet.   Place is clean and waiters are always coming by to refill drinks. A good place to eat cheap and good food."}
{"text":"CLOSED as of today for uncleanliness Is it bad I still want to go back?  I really hope I don't lose all credibility with this one but I really enjoyed my time here! I hadn't been to a buffet since old country as a kid with my grandparents and this place blew me away. For 7 of us it was $4 a person avg for food (including tip!) with the help of a restaurant.com $2 gift card for $25 worth of food. I enjoyed orange chicken, sushi, fruit, mystery fish, and ice cream. I wanted to try the hibachi portion but it just looked too sketchy. One person said it was the best $4 meal they ever had and I would say I have to agree! I gave stars as though I paid the new $6 lunch buffet price, which would have been much less exciting but still an interesting place worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at this place with my family. the food is not freash, cheap made, and seem to expired. My mon felt sick after eating their unfreash oyster."}
{"text":"BEWARE! I went here past October and had a serious finger infection from eating the crab legs. Large amount of pus removed and the results from the lab was food contamination. Apparently, insect feces were in the food and went inside the nail of my thumb, thus the finger infection. Even thought the outside is clean, you don't know what the kitchen looks like. I don't anyone to go through what I've been. Someone needs to call the health inspection."}
{"text":"I know this is too much information, but I have to warn you all.  I thought this place was pretty good, huge variety, pretty decent food. HOWEVER, that decent variety of food came out of me THAT NIGHT from BOTH ENDS... x___x Even with the coupon (which they almost didn't accept), this was not worth all the pain and suffering I had to endure. NEVER AGAIN. :'("}
{"text":"My experience was overshadowed by the cons: the hostess said that drinks were included in the buffet price and then the drinks were added to the final bill, many buffet items are not identified in writing, what appeared (i.e. I'm not 100% sure) to be a small, white maggot was on a piece of steak from the Mongolian stir-fry area, the sushi was mediocre and they didn't have any snow crab legs.  Other than that, most of the food was decent.  There are plenty of Chinese dishes (imagine a more authentic version of Panda Express) and there are some good seafood dishes with plenty of shrimp available.  The ice cream is also pretty yummy and the buffet price is reasonable."}
{"text":"My Mother in Law's \"husband\" chose this place for lunch.  They live in the area.  He had been before and liked it.  Well, I have to say my expectations weren't high considering the source.  Walking in they have a nice koi pond.  Great for the kids.  You pay on the way in and sit wherever you want.  We were early so had our pick of tables.  Some tables were dirty and some were lopsided.  The chairs had greasy hand prints in the back.  The floors were dirty.  Especially under our table.   I would have walked out but we don't visit them often.    We all ventured up to the buffet.  They have a lot of choices.  I'll give them that.  Lots of sushi but none that I wanted to take a chance on.  I like Tom Yum soup.  I tried it and it was lukewarm.  I also tried a Bao, that was good.  Gyoza-cold, chow mein-cold, teriyaki chicken- cold.  Honey chicken was good, chicken on a stick was cold.  Chicken wings didn't get refilled while I was there, neither did the fries or pizza.  Yes... they have fries and pizza.  They also have a hibachi station.  Nobody was eating that except my husband had some beef cooked for him.  He said it was good but that was pretty much it for him.   Dessert consisted of a chocolate fountain which I had no desire to eat and other mediocre desserts.  Best dessert was the almond cookies that were still in the packaging that they came in.    Prices are cheap so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had my first frog legs there, yummy. A lot of selection, slight skimp on quality. Was confused a little in regards to using the coupon I got in the paper as they didn't apply it toward the overall cost, but gave me cash."}
{"text":"Sign on door says, \"Closed for one month.\"  Really enjoyed Safeway rotisserie chicken and baked potato salad.  Glad, \"open\" is part of Safeway's business model."}
{"text":"I liked the \"grill\" portion of this place. While what I got was too spicy for me (my own fault) the idea of it is great.   The rest was plain-ol-chinese-buffy food.   The staff was there but never bothered you unless to refill the water.   The place is huge as it was a former Peter Piper Pizza, then a banquet hall.   PS I saw you there Jake.."}
{"text":"UNSANITARY conditions, FOOD TEMPERATURES not correct, Cross contamination visibly apparent - BAD MANAGEMENT and Hygiene issues with servers: AVOID AT ALL COSTS SERIOUSLY. I have never been so negative and critical in  my reviews, I was treated poorly by management when I complained about food temperatures, \"he\" plainly said \"I DON'T CARE!\" multiple times to me in front of others. The meat was lukewarm, the tempura was hard as in old and greasy, the selection was limited, the supposed to be chilled shrimp was moist and lukewarm as well. I had to stop eating as I bit into tasteless, hard, greasy bits. I still paid my $40 (prices of drinks not included) but easily could have left the minute I saw the food. My mistake. I SAW the server pull his dirty pants from the butt crack section  (in front of me) while serving drinks to other table. The waitress made me wait 10 minutes before I got up to ask for more drinks, I literally walked across the restaurant to get a hold of her even though it this place was empty. The seats were sticky and walls had orange chicken fingerprints all over, the floor had grease, crumbs, dry food juice. The 'GRILL, HOW IRONIC SINCE THEY CALL THEMSELVES Buffet GRILL\" was not being attended by any cook, the sushi avocado was old and browned so not appetizing. The ice cream barrels (self serve by scooping) was almost empty so when people scoop their ice cream inside the barrels their dirty bare hands touch the same ice cream the next person gets..ON and On... I asked to speak to a \"manager\" and all he could say was \"I don't care, you have to pay\" about 4 times loudly. THEY WILL EVENTUALLY SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME, HEADACHE OR MONEY. Oh also if you don't eat all your food on the plate at this \"BUFFET\" then there is a sign that you may have to pay extra for leftovers not eaten on site, what a JOKE! Oh...servers might not understand your English either.  ( I would not take time out of my life to write this if I was not seriously concerned majorly about the unsanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in this ill-ran place)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Each time I go, I wonder why I keep going.  The food is salty and not prepared very well.  The Crawfish are dirty as well.  I haven't been since they had their grand opening."}
{"text":"I definitely would not be coming back to this place!!!! Horrible experience over all!!!! customer service sucks!!!! They seriously need to work on that!!  They have a lot of food but nothing was good, the cashier over charge us and when I went to tell her they made such a big deal and didn't want to give us a refund of the price difference, her or the manager never Even apologized for their own mistake plus gave us an attitude!!  And the server never came to refill our drinks, and they wanted to charge full price for my 2 1/2yr old niece ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with Rand H, Jeromy H, and Norm R.  This is a really nice buffet restaurant with a very large and cheesy fountain when you first walk in.  The tables and booths are comfortable and set apart from the buffet area.    This buffet is huge and has all the usual Chinese buffet items, sushi, and a hibachi grill.  The peel n eat shrimp were very good, not mushy or rubbery like most places and the quality of the food was some of the best I've had for a buffet.  How this place differed than most, they had beef roast that you sliced yourself and other beef, prime rib maybe?, that were both tasty and tender.    The only drawback was most of the staff does not speak English, so don't bother asking what something is if you don't know.  Mike C asked what kind of pie/cake that was on the dessert table and was told \"cake\". Obviously!  It was very yummy whatever it was!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times & for the most part the food has been decent, but today will definitely be my last time eating here. The food quality has gone down hill. It's as if they literally don't care to receive any return business. Nothing about today's dining was good. The general buffet was bland, the sushi was horrible &  the hibachi was bland as well. I should have gone to a traditional Chinese restaurant or any other buffet, but here."}
{"text":"Had not been to this place in a year or more. Started off poorly with help pushing past us with no manners. A simple excuse me goes a long way.   We arrived shortly after 3:00 pm and ate off of the buffet. Needless to say the food was average at best. Most items were barely warm and unappetizing for most of our party. When it came time to pay the check they tried to charge us Dinner prices rather than lunch prices, saying that they waitress had marked our arrival at 3:41pm. One of us had sent a text shortly after finishing and the time was 3:31. Needless to say we basically were called liars. Really, this is how they conduct business?  I would not return to this place for any reason. They did resolve to give us the lunch price, but they would not honor a 10% discount card. Effectively we paid the dinner pricing. $47 for sub par food for lunch for a party of four is ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"The prices are very affordable and a very large selection of food to choose from. The wait staff was very pleasant, ooh can't forget the desert station, it was fully stocked....i will return!!!!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement we decided to eat lunch there on Saturday.  This place actually got worse.  The food was DISGUSTING! Had to choke it down.  Items were empty and stayed empty FOREVER and if you ask someone that works there they dont even answer you, they just walk away. AND to top it off my favorite item a very common one Sweet and Sour Chicken they took off the menu.  Kept the sauce on the bar but took the chicken off.  This time I am serious WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Wow, I really wandered to this page expecting more negative reviews and got my mind blown. I kept checking the address to make sure I had the right restaurant, but sure enough I may be the only crazy one who sees it.   The people behind the counters didn't understand anything we asked them, the place is super typical of a buffet that does not put a whole lot of effort into look and quality yet makes a profit off of the cheap food and ingredients.   Total mistake on my part for picking this place, should have taken one look at curb appeal alone and ran away.  People watching at this gem is the one thing that does make the dining experience a little bearable."}
{"text":"Went here because we had a coupon and was craving fresh hibachi and sushi. Yeah what a big disappointment, not only was the cashier rude (first encounter) but so was the owner or manager. We had to seat ourselves, and ask for drinks (I had to search for a server) the food was overall ok, nothing extraordinary. But yet again I had to look for someone to refill our drinks. Not only that but then we saw a family of 6 get seated right next to us basically blocking our way making them get up every time we wanted to go get food. Overall a bad experience, wouldn't choose to go there again."}
{"text":"This place is massive.   The price was good and I think I was expecting too much.  First stop was the hibachi station,  and if you are used to a Mongolia grill, it's the same thing, except you don't have much choice of sauces.  It was okay.  The hot crab legs were good.  We came on  Monday night so it was pretty slow.  Perhaps that's why some items looked like they'd been there awhile.  There are a lot of choices, even tacos, fries, wings.  Not much appealed to me.  On to dessert.  The cakes were bland and dry.  The cookies were stale.  The fried biscuits, like malasadas, we're the best thing I tried.  Overall, it was just...meh.  Perhaps if I tried again when they are busy, it will be better.  Table staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I was just finishing up my last customer stop for the day and mentioned I was going to lunch in the Metro Center area and he asked if I would mind some company.  We settled on here and he is somewhat a regular.  Getting there around 11:30 the lot was full and inside was pretty busy.  I always like to see a lot of people in a buffet so the food turns faster.  Speaking of the food, I had nothing I felt like not finishing.  The grill line was really long so I didn't try that but my customer says that is the best part.  I had several items from the sushi counter.  The ice cream was the proper consistency.  I may have just had the wrong things but nothing really stood out as having much flavor.  It gets the 4th star for being a good value at $6.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch is sometimes the best time to eat at restaurants, and at this buffet that is no different. The weekly price for lunch is $7.99 and M-Th you can eat in for 20% off that price.   There's the standard Chinese buffet fare spread out over 8 buffet stands, and then there's a sushi bar and a hibachi grill bar. They have four types of soup including wonton, hot and sour, and egg drop.   Lots of seafood options and options for vegetarians as well.   There's a little ice chest with individual ice cream cups in different flavored. Unfortunately if you want to \"take it out\" it's an extra $.75.  They serve pretty cheap beer and wine, for under $5.  The staff cleaning the tables are pretty attentive and clean your plates out regularly and refill your water cups often.  When we first tried to come in this past Tuesday, they had dinner pricing ($10.99, no drink) supposedly in honor of the Mexican Mother's Day holiday. I honestly think they were doing that to just up charge and make more money.   Besides for that, it was a pretty decent buffet and the food was tasty enough that I would go back for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I try and stay away from these types of Places they lose so much quality ... A friend of mine said it was \"Pretty Good\" he is the same guy who says\" 2 Pop Tarts and a Mountain Dew is a pretty \" Good \" Breakfast!. Ok so I said to myself I will humor him! As I walk in I see a pretty nice water fall I guess they are trying to give the place a little more upscale appeal!       This place has got to be The Mac Daddy of Buffets! As big as a football field!  No less than 100 items or it seems!! I am going to try and mention some of the items; Pizza, Fried Mushrooms, Peel and eat shrimp, claims, broiled and fried fish and shrimp,beef &broccoli,Sushi, Soups 4 or 5 types Hibachi Grill they cook it you pick your meat pork,chicken,beef, and then pick your vegetables of about 20! Chicken Wings 'Sesame chicken,fries, Egg Rolls And Spring rolls Salad with about 20 ingredients Soft serve Ice cream with 20 toppings,Deserts cookies ,cakes AND MUCH MUCH MORE!           Ok so your get you plate and pick your vise. I swear for the Life of me do not understand why people do not know that any kind of seafood under constant heat will turn to rubber or worse! Thats the quality thing on Buffets that is lost!           I am giving this place 3 stars for being a very Clean place as you can see by the pictures! They had a pretty good sushi selection ..not the best of seafood but, they had a wide selection. And they had a pretty good Salad mix ..And of course for The Mac Daddy Size .. In this case size matters some what..."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Chinese food but my wife loves it. We have came here a few times. Not that big of a selection but the food was good. No complaints from us. The kids always get a kick out of the fishes they she when they walk in.."}
{"text":"This place blows other Chinese buffets out of the water . Everything is so good here ,my family and I have been here multiple times and it never gets old ! Can you say crab legs at dinner oh yea can't forget about the oysters"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have bee to this buffet. The first time was the week it opened, the second was about a month ago, and the 3rd was tonight. It seems to be getting worse every time I go. This time the staff got us the correct drinks, and they were on top of it, but they sat us right next to the staff break room area and I had to listen to the wait staff talking the entire time. The last time I went they kept giving me diet soda even after I told them 3 times diet soda makes me sick and I need a regular cola. The food has gotten worse every time I come. I think the only thing I finished was my egg drop soup. The chicken, was mostly all fat. I must have tried 4 different types and they were all the same. I did pick up two onions rings, which I know you should not eat American food it is a Chinese food buffet but I thought I would try them and they were rock hard. The chow mein noodles I got was under cooked with no flavor at all. They had some calamari tonight that was also hard as a rock. There sushi is good if you like a lot of veggies in your rolls, which I do. There desert is kind of hit or miss. Some items are good, I had some cheese cake tonight that was really good, but some items are not. I picked up what looked to be a rice kripes treat but I could not tell you what it was because it was so hard I could not bite down. They have the traditional fruit in the desert area, grapes, oranges, and bananas in a strawberry sauce.  They have  ice cream as well which I have never tried, because they can not seem to label it correctly. When I can clearly see that the white ice cream is marked as mint and the brown ice cream is marked as green tea I tend to stay away. For some reason I will never understand people like this place, my husband is one of them. To me it is not worth the $10 for dinner even on a weeknight price tag."}
{"text":"This place is now renamed Super Moon, but I don't think I'll be making a trip to find out if it is any better. The buffet was definitely huge, with a ton of different foods on it.   The chinese food had sauces on the side (you could pour sweet and sour sauce on the chicken) but the chicken was rubbery. Other buffet items like chicken nuggets, mac and cheese, jello, and pudding were available. The sushi looked decent but I did not try it because I was not sure how long it had been sitting out. The salad bar was loaded with half wilted lettuce. There were other bland items too, but nothing about this place stood out except for its high price. With all the great restaurants in the area I would never go back."}
{"text":"10/27/2017  I eat at Hibachi Grill occasionally and it has it's good points and it's bad points.  First the good:  There is a Mongolian grill that will cook what you pick out to eat without extra charge, they do have a tip jar.  They have a Sushi section with a large selection of good freshly made Sushi to choose from.  They have a large selection of soup, Asian dishes, Kung Pao, Jalapeno Chicken, Broccoli Chicken, Gen. Tao's Chicken  are some of my favorite.  They also have Fish,  baked and fried, Peel and eat  Shrimp,  and other dishes containing shrimp, Crawfish, Chicken wings, Pizza, Asian Vegetables, French fries and many other dishes too numerous to list.  They have a large fruit section with Watermelon, Honeydew melon, oranges, pears among other selections.  They also have deserts  with cake cookies,  chocolate fountain with strawberries, ice cream, and yogurt.  Hibachi has many more selections to choose to eat which I haven't listed, you just have to see for yourself.  I have never had a problem with being seated immediately, as it is a large place.  The servers do their best removing dirty dishes and I have never had a problem with my drink being refilled.  There is a dollar discount for seniors, and regular price is a little over $10,  and a discount for kids.  The negative things that I've found at Hibachi are, some of the food like the Chicken wings seem to be reheated from the day before and are not fresh.  Some serving trays are overheated and the food is dry.  Sometimes the trays are not hot enough.  At times they are slow to bring out fresh food, but I think this could be blamed on customer flow and what they take and do not take to eat.  In the past, I would find plates and silverware with food stuck to them, but there has been a noticeable improvement in that area.  The place could use a cleaning, I see smudges on the glass partition separating tables.  As you can see I have listed some pros and cons of Hibachi Grill and I want to be fair as I think with a few improvements, this could be a really good place that's affordable.  I recommend giving them a try and leave any constructive criticism to make it a better place.  One other thing, it's located on the Northwest corner of Nellis and Stewart, North of CiCi's Pizza in the Nellis Plaza.  It is hard to  see until you pull in the parking area  and is  in the middle of the strip mall there."}
{"text":"The only problem I have with this place is the Hispanic grill cook. He is rude and racist! I have complained about him the last two visits. When they fire him and bring in a cook who is friendly to everybody, then I will return."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It was a buffet, we didn't expect the food to be that great. And it wasn't, really. But it wasn't bad. My son and husband devoured the all you can eat sushi and the kids got to try things that they've never had such as clams, squid, and crawdads. For kids who are less adventurous than ours, there is a pizza and chicken area. Everything from over there looked pretty dry and basic, but I'm sure for anyone who came to a chinese buffet and grabbed some American food instead, they will get what they expect. I wasn't all that impressed with the service.   What they do have are these melt in your mouth sweet roll things with some sort of honey butter and it is to die for. I swear, I dream about them. I would go back just to have some more of that one item. I'm not even kidding."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times over the past year and the quality of food and service has declined sharply.   I hope they make improvements as the reviews are declining as well, but I will be reluctant to return.  If you do visit this location, the Hibachi (Mongolian Grill) is pretty good. Pick your ingredients and they'll cook it up however you like. So if its more cost effective that going to Genghis Khan or whatever then knock yourself out."}
{"text":"Our trip was less than stellar. The selection of food items was solid. There were lots of options and when I first got there I was really hungry and it all looked great from afar. The restaurant itself seemed pretty clean too which is a must, right?  The food was the disappointment. The selection was a mile wide and 1 inch deep if you get my meaning. The food seemed under salted and under seasoned. Bland and or greasy.   Overall I would love to give it another shot since the location is convenient for me."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because the review requires it.  This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever seen,  along with an indifferent and socially defunct crew.  You're better off eating gas station sushi. You're probably better off even licking the asphalt outside of the restaurant. Mockery aplenty from the staff when cleanliness was addressed,  and the seafood tasted the same way dirty socks smell."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Chinese buffets. The prices are low, the wait staff is efficient and friendly, and there is always a great selection of hot food and desserts. They even have sushi! Most of the offerings are flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"I pretty much hate chinese buffets.  A lot.  My husband likes them though, and so I occasionally concede to go with him.  Usually, I'll just try to get him to take one of the kids on a \"date\" though, so I don't  have to set foot in them.  I generally find them dingy, somewhat shabby, and the food is mediocre at best.  THIS is the first time I have ever gone to a Chinese buffet, and would actually consider going BACK without a fight.  They have a LARGE selection of food, and I found almost all of it to be quality stuff.  They haven't skimped so much on the ingredients just in order to have quantity, either.  The shrimp was cooked well, and not all tough, like it usually is in these places.  This was also the CLEANEST buffet I have ever visited.  By far.    I loved the hibachi, which allowed me to throw together my own stuff, and have it cooked fresh.  I do wish that they had more sauces, though.  Another plus is that they have ice cream (8 flavors) that you can hand dip yourself.  I usually hate the soft serve in these places because it just tastes off to me, but this was real ice cream.  They even had a sugar-free offering."}
{"text":"Driving in my FDX area, had the chance to take my 2 favorite girls this place I eat allot.This is it. I think I made some points.You know when you go there allot and they call you be your first name. I heard the girls saying \" yes that was good and yes that was good\" So I think it was a good choosing on my part.  My girls were happy and they have a big selection of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Lots of food to choose from.  It was not busy when we got there so some of the food was cold.  The hibachi grill was good.  The sushi had no tuna at all, and was not totally fresh, they did not have the types I liked but was good still.  The dessert was large and had many good choices including 8 types of ice cream.   If it was more busy I bet the food would have been even better.  As it was it was better than the other west valley Asian buffets I gave been to."}
{"text":"The food was old didn't have anything good the temp in the restaurant was like 90 degrees in there definitely last time I'll visit"}
{"text":"Our office goes here like once a week. It's retarded, but we love it. But when you're VIP ballers, this place is awesome. You jealous?"}
{"text":"For $10 a person and I hardly ate one plate of food.  There were a ton of options (even really exotic stuff like frog legs) but everything I tried was mediocre to just plain bad. Not sure where these 4+ star reviews are coming from. Have you had real Asian food before? It had interesting décor (huge fountain with real fish, glitter inlay tables) and the staff was friendly enough but the price should be a little cheaper during lunch hours, especially with the quality of food. I'll stick to regular take-out or Mongolian BBQ next time I get a craving for the East."}
{"text":"Haven't ate there in almost 4 months and it has gone down hill in taste.  The hibachi was ok but the person cooking it was very slow and didn't cook the meat completely and when I said lots of teriyaki he looked at me as if he didn't speak any English.  The chicken wings were way undercooked  While some things were over cooked.  When you are seated they segregate you from sitting mixed in.   Won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, add to that we came in an hour before they closed and all the trays seems fresh.   It was a little more expensive then other buffets I have been to, and they charged my 11 as an adult & he barely ate one plate, so that's why they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place was clearly not the best and actually borderline worst.  I would have thought that coming in at around 5:30 PM, things would have been fresh or at least close to fresher for the dinner crowd.  NOPE...many items appeared to have been sitting there awhile, which I never touched.  I went for things that looked fresh/recently replenished.  I tried their sushi, that was a mistake, many of the items appeared to have recently been put out, because there was so much...again, NOPE...it had to have been sitting there for at least an hour or more...the rice was already hard, not semi, but crunchy...not good.  Probably the only hot item they had worth commenting on is the deep fried shrimp...actually good size shrimp and the breading was fairly crispy.  The only items that were decent, the mandarin oranges, that clearly came out of a can and their desserts, that were purchased some place else and they just put on the buffet line.  The service was slow, which is bad, considering there were like 4 servers and about 6 tables...I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I wouldn't go back myself..."}
{"text":"Good variety of tasty food!  Very clean and great service."}
{"text":"Ok I cannot really genuinely review this place because it is a buffet.   Eat! tons of food and choices. Well maintained and freshly renewed by the staff. Some days this place is packed other days it is not so packed but always busy. It is one the best buffets I have been to in Phoenix Metro. I am not a fan of the buffet but I can put up with this one,  They have most of the items I enjoy at a Chinese buffet"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from the last time, someone who give this place a 5 stars is crazy. There is a better buffet by Spectrum Mall on Bethany Home and 15th Ave called Mandarin Buffet. For the price you pay, Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet has an especially underwhelming selection of food. Not only that, the food is probably some of the worse I've had at a chinese buffet. It's not even worth wasting your daily caloric or sodium intake to try this food. Please do yourself a huge favor and don't waste your money on this place. I'm sorry to say that I did."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. It has so many items to choose from on the regular buffet, not to mention a small sushi selection and the hibachi grill (which I've had a hard time finding in this area). I always go before 3:30 to get the lunch price and because I don't find their dinner offerings to be any more appealing for the money. If I remember correctly they serve seafood at dinner and I'm not a fan.   Anyway, over the years the quality seems to have declined. Either that or my standards have risen. Any of the beef dishes seem to have a lot of gristle. Service is hit or miss. It's either very good or you're totally ignored once seated. Today it was uncomfortably warm in the building. We couldn't wait to leave.  This was probably my last visit to Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet. There's a whole lot better out there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet to go to I love this place! What sucks though is most of the time that I've gone we've had to wait a good 20 minuets for a table because there's a line and it's always packed but it's definitely worth the wait I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Okay it's a buffet so i am rating this against other buffet's but it doesn't really matter because it gets one star either way.  Variety is bad here, (one the layout is crappy and could have been better used to maximize space and provide more table space for different options) . The food i couldn't find one thing i like, not even vegetables. Oh wait i lied, the fried sweet donut was good and the hibachi grill was decent for a buffet one.  Bad part about the hibachi grill...i was waiting there for 5 minutes before the chef even came out of the backroom to start cooking my food. Also i got a glimpse of the backroom when he opened the door, i wish i didn't GROSS!!!  Also they had some workers cleaning snow peas on a table where people eat....i decided to avoid snowpeas for my trip after seeing that. Not a food surface and not okay.  Plus side, this place is really clean for a buffet. Lots of places to sit so you can bring a group. The price is very reasonable...but than again you pay for what you get...cheap price cheap/crap food.  Wait i'm not done...thats right i am not done. The wait staff was horrible, All the other 4 that were on duty were too busy talking to each other, braiding each others hair and gossiping about customers while one guy was busy busting his butt off trying to wait on a dozen or more tables all over the restaurant. Not only was it one guy doing it all, but this guy barely spoke any english (i am not hating on him for not speaking english), He REALLY REALLY could have used some help from the chatty kathy's in the back. Hopefully they wont have to split tips, because none of the other workers deserved it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one Sunday afternoon and it wasnt that bad.  It was about $10.65 I think per person (adult lunch on a weekend) and we ordered one hot tea.  It wasnt bad for the price at all.  There was a lot of food and different varieties available for people who like sushi, seafood, veggies, stir fry, chinese of all sorts, and desserts! The food was good, neither of us felt sick or got stick eating at this busy buffet so that says a lot.  The bathrooms are clean and the place is large.  The owner was very nice and they have a beautiful koi pond at the entrance.  They even let you feed the fish (for $0.25 for fish food of course).  Would come back if we're in the area again"}
{"text":"For the price, the atmosphere and variety, you can't beat it. Must have the mongolian BBQ (hibachi grill)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my mom, brother, and her husband. My family is full of skinny people but we go here bc my stepdad us a cheapskate. The variety is really good and there's fresh veggies. I never went to a buffet before coming to Phoenix so I guess this one is not so bad.   The thing is, there's a ton if huge, gigantic people who go here to load up. I find that disturbing. But I'm assuming they like to frequent buffets."}
{"text":"Food had a lot of flavor was really good.  Hudge selection of food including crab legs which where ok. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wanted to throw a quick update about this place. I ended up going back again on a Monday night and the price didn't change. So I guess it's about $11 per person no matter which night you go on. Still a great deal for all the food you get."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this location, but when I went here this past Saturday, the place was shut down! There was a letter posted on the door saying that the tenants hadn't paid their rent and the locks had been changed. So I guess this location is closed until further notice? I guess the bright side was that they were closed down for not paying the bills rather than a health code violation..."}

{"text":"I love bringing the family here for our asian cravings. The place is worth the money, and I feel like it is definitely better than Buffet @ Asia for the pricing. (About the same cost.)  The selection is vast, the only downfall is that they don't keep their items refilled, so people will stand and wait until the crab, or the oysters on the 1/2 shell are put out, then take what was brought. I find it rude, but when you don't keep the bins stocked, that is what happens.   The wait staff usually comes by a few times to refresh the drinks, but don't go expecting better service than you get a the other place. I always remind my family that is a cheap buffet."}
{"text":"This was awful experience for us. It was kind of dirty, the food was not tasteful at all aside from the ice cream. I tried very many different things but nothing was satisfying. Never going their again. The customer was decent."}
{"text":"Calling for boycott.   I would give NO Stars if that was an option.   I would encourage everyone to boycott this restaurant!   Here is the reason for my personal boycott:  The Hibachi Grill Supreme Buffet claims to give you a FREE buffet for every 9th visit to their restaurant.   Don't believe them they are using the following trick to avoid giving the repeat customers their promised free meal.   Here is what they do:  They hand out a separate card with one stamp, per visit. If, you do not bring the same card on every visit they will tell you, the 8 stamps, proving your visits, are invalid and you will be denied your promised FREE buffet.   I asked for the manager and got no satisfaction, then I asked for their boss and was told he is not here....   Then, I ask for the bosses phone number and she said she doesn't know it.   Finally I ask for the owners phone number, she claimed she doesn't know who owns the restaurant.   Does this sound like they care about your feedback?   So it boils down to this....   This company would rather lose a regular customer than to honor their word and bond to their customers.   For this reason, I would like to ask you to boycott the restaurant, until the management begins to appreciate their customers.   Honesty is the best policy.   I will not return to this restaurant again.   I hope you find this review helpful."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is huge!! Where have you seen a koi pond inside of the buffet?! Unlike other Chinese buffets, I haven't had to wait for a table. And for $14, drinks are included!   My favorite things to get include the hot crabs, oysters, sashimi, baked mussels, and grilled items. They also have a Mongolian Grill where you stack your plate with items you want (vegetables, meat, noodles, egg, etc), give it to the cook, and presto-freshly cooked noodles! It's especially good when you add garlic & chili paste at the end!   The staff is also very attentive, they're always quick to take empty plates from the table, refill drinks, and lately I've noticed they do their best to quickly refill the crab legs and oysters (since people have been taking 'em by the platefuls).   Also sashimi quality has gotten a lot better!  They offer mackerel, salmon, tuna, and one other fish (I don't know the name of, but it's delicious!) I've tried them all during multiple visits and so far haven't had problems with my tums, so the fish is good by my book!   They also offer two aisles of desserts, 4 different soups, salt & pepper crab, seafood delight, chicken, pizza, and a whole bunch of other typical Chinese buffet dishes.   If you're looking for a cheap Chinese buffet that offers crab legs, oysters, and a Mongolian grill, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them any stars!! Me and my partner waited over 15 minutes just for our drinks! The lady was sooo rude! When she came to drop off my card back she waited till I filled out for a tip! I gave her none since service was horrible! She then question me and why I gave her no tip and shock her head. This is very unprofessional and we will never come back here again!! I felt discriminated because we are a gay couple! STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!!"}
{"text":"If you can eat its a must !! Food is bomb especially the flat top cooker shoutout to him ! Bad thing its a bit PRICEY but other then that food is great! Everyone that saying food is cold is a hater!"}
{"text":"Its a really nice place the food ain't that good aint that bad either its like a 7 out of 10"}
{"text":"Okay, the low reviews? I don't get it! This place is as cheap as dirt.   I'm reviewing this place on it's price point. They've got tons of dishes, insanely cheap take-out after 9PM (half off) and comfy booths. Don't go here for sushi and expect a delicacy. Expect tons of food, tons of variety, some good sweet and sour soup and ALL YOU CAN EAT!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price and variety. It's great for what it is, a cheap Chinese buffet and grill. I skip the sushi and load up on sweet and sour soup, Chinese donuts and sesame balls with green tea ice cream for dessert!   I've blown way too much cash in those quarter sliders. Whee! Convent location by the mall and nerd table top gaming store not far."}
{"text":"For the price it can't be beat. Some food was cold. The grill masters were workin their butts off at top speed so I gave them a fiver. Lots of variety. Good stuff all over. Green tea ice cream! Cheapo sushi. Roast beef. Fresh grill steak.   Blow some money in the quarter pushers.  Taking off a star for restroom cleanliness."}
{"text":"The food was warm and relatively good tasting. Our waitress, May, was super sweet. She even brought out a birthday cake for my husband. She even decorated the cake and adorned it with cherries and whipped cream. I am not a fan of buffets, but when my husband wants Chinese buffet, we will go back because we were treated excellently."}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. The place was dirty, the food was disgusting, and the sushi looked like a biohazard."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. It's a buffet and the whole time they watched us eat like if we were doing something wrong. Very bad customer service. I wdon't to hard for my money and this is one place I will not return to."}
{"text":"I have tried NUMEROUS Asian buffets and restaurants.  My husband and I have been waiting for this place to finally open.  We tried it today 4/13/14.  Boy were we DISAPPOINTED!!  The Hibachi grill a good assortment of meat and veggies but SERIOUSLY lacking in seasoning options.  The cook used water to Stem the food and threw some soy sauce on it but it was very bland!!! Tried the different soups, lack of seasoning.  The coconut shrimp and cream cheese wont tons were sickening sweet.  The teriyaki chicken was very bland.  Numerous dishes lack any seasoning and taste!  The best thing I had was the pineapple and mocha cake.  Seriously regret going there, our stomachs have been regretting it ALL day!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an all you can eat place. The lo mein is tasty as are the spare ribs. The have a wide variety of soups the egg drop and wonton mixed is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is okay, their hibachi grill and the fact that they serve beer is problem the best part about this place. The rest of the food on the buffet is really bland and doesn't really have flavor. The sushi bar is also okay, but I wish they had a bigger selection of sushi, most of the sushi is the same roll, but with different sauce on it. Also the sushi tastes frozen and pretty bland also. The Thai tea is good, but it is also way sweeter than most Thai teas I've had. So you can't drink a lot of it. I am giving this place 2 stars only because the hibachi grill is really good, you can choose what type of meats,vegetables, and sauces that you want, and they cook it fresh. The chocolate fountain is a good idea, but I would definitely not use chocolate from there due to the fact that I saw a whole bunch of little kids sticking their fingers and hands in there. They also only have strawberries, marshmallows, and pineapple to dip in the chocolate fountain. There should be a bigger selection of fruit for the chocolate fountain. Next time I will only be coming here for the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"This place is just straight up filthy. How am I suppose to eat at a buffet when almost every plate had leftovers on them. Like I'm not even kidding. Even the workers, not even properly dressed and in the very back you can see them on their phones. In. Plain. Sight. Tables were sticky, had to ask for a new washed spoon and fork. Will not be returning. This place is just poorly run. And don't even get me STARTED about the bathrooms.."}
{"text":"For the price its a good buffet. You can come here and have a different meal almost every night.   I don't eat much buffet style but I can come in here and have sushi for dinner at a steal, or get some healthy hibachi cooked food and when I want to I can grab something to cheat on.   Its also great that this place always has specials, discounts and coupons circulating in all kinds of magainzes, mailers and everywhere you look."}
{"text":"If Field of Dreams was never made, \"Build it and they will come\" would have been coined to describe the Chinese Buffet. Just about anywhere you build one of these babies, people come out of the woodwork to eat. And eat they do. It's like people don't realize what a buffet is, and that they can go back more than once. The artwork that goes into stacking pile after pile onto the plate is simply incredible.  Regardless, the selection here isn't particularly outstanding, and nothing you won't find at any of another couple dozen buffets anywhere else in the Charlotte metro. The difficult part is getting to this one - it's on the opposite side of I-85 from the rest of Concord/Kannapolis, so it might take you an extra minute, and then it's down in a hole.  There isn't really any service to speak of, except when it comes to clearing your plate and presenting your check with the stale fortune cookie."}
{"text":"What is with the food Nazis? As if anyone wanted a second helping of this disaster..  Steer clear if you have any love for your abdominal tract. I've accidently ingested dog food that taste better. There are far better options close by, so do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.   +1 for the Chinese donuts."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, and the employees are attentive and so very friendly. Will definitely come here again! Also, free Wi-Fi!!!!"}
{"text":"Just to say I'm not a big fan of buffets. I haven't been here in over a year and sorry to say this place has went down hill. I'm never hot, matter of fact i brought a sweater just in case it was too cold for me like most restaurant are. However, the AC must not been working because it was hot. I had started to sweat by the time we were done eating (they sat us right under a fan). The sushi was old probably because there was barely anyone in there and has been sitting too long (went about 3:30pm on a Friday paid dinner rate in which you get krab legs, roast, coconut shrimp and crawfish). The crawfish was very good. I did not like the coconut shrimp at all but my son did. The fried \"dungeon\" crab leg custers were a big joke, they were so small they barely had any meat in them. These were not your typical snow or king crab legs. What upset me the most is the workers (especially the sushi chef) kept staring my 14 year old son down anytime he would go to the food stations. Sorry, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful! AYCE crab legs, some sushi, huge selection of various entrees and appetizers, and an awesome chocolate fountain amongst other desserts. The dining area is fairly clean. Bathrooms could be cleaner... My one huge complaint is about the server. She didn't pay very close attention to my boyfriend and I. At one point we asked for napkins, and she picked up a pile of napkins off a table that another family had literally just left and gave those to is. That's pretty disgusting in my opinion.   Whatever, still worth the visit :)"}
{"text":"Most places you go, if your unhappy they are great to understand. NOT this place. The manager seemed so offended that I did not care for anything on my plate. It was either soggy, no flavor or cold. I had 8 bites out of everything on my plate. I got rice, noddles, chicken and broccoli, pepper steak, won tons and an egg roll. I spit out the egg roll and the won tons the noddles were soggy and just plain gross. Out of the 8 bites I spit out 4 into a napkin. I was so sad to try this place one more time and now I will never go back again.  At one point the manager threatened to call the cops because I really didn't want to pay for food I didn't eat. He threatened me a lot this evening and I finally lost my mouth and cussed while talking not at him just around him. I wish I could give this place no stars due to his attitude."}
{"text":"Cheap! 9.99 for dinner  Food was okay, service was good. I really enjoyed the wide selection of fresh fruits!   Bf and I are huge dessert fans, when it comes to banana pudding, we find that buffets are skimpy with their Nilla wafers! But not here!! They jam packed it with tons of Nilla wafers!"}
{"text":"been to a few Asian buffets and so far this is the best one so far...it has more variations then other Asian buffets. had lots to pick from...the only thing I didn't see there were crab legs other then that it was pretty good"}
{"text":"Always a variety. I mean it's the best Chinese buffet in the immediate area. Not much to compare it to, I can understand the mediocre reviews. The nice part... you can make your own dish for them to grill up.   Def worth the money for lunch and togo. Value and variety when you crave Chinese food."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place often. And myself and my family used to enjoy coming here. Over the past few years the quality and service has significantly declined. Charged us adult prices for my tall children despite them being of the child age range. Food quality is now subpar and they take forever to replenish the items and will let empty trays sit on the buffet line. Sad as this was our go to spot. I will no longer come here."}
{"text":"Bad idea. Tried Hibachi Grill Supreme Buffet tonight. I was sucked in by the 2 sided full page color ad. Over 250 items plus sushi and hibachi. Some of it looked too bad to try and all the things I tried (including snails, octopus, frog legs, sushi rolls and hibachi) were AWFUL. The only good things were the salty shrimp and my glass of Coke. Note to self - never eat any buffet again. I think it was all radioactive products that Japan is dumping on America."}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend have been coming here for almost 4 years. The price was recently hiked up approximately $2 more than the previous $7.99 it seems. But we've always received prompt service, only once did we have a difficult time with the waiter. Chances are is that since I'm Asian, and my boyfriend is Caucasian, is what caused the not so great treatment. It happens ever so often when the establishment is mandated by Asian males. The females don't seem to care, and are always happy to see us.  We usually come here only for a few staples, their smoked chicken, egg rolls, soups, fried rice, and fried noodle dishes. And we stay the hell away from the ice cream. I found it pretty disgusting that people and snotty nosed kids could stick their dirty hands into the ice cream cartons in the freezer to serve themselves. No thanks.  I've tried their sushi previously, but experience has taught me to never EVER eat buffet sushi. Same rule applies here, unless you don't really have a reference level, then by all means, go for it.  I haven't tried their hibachi grill yet, I probably will soon. I'm afraid of it being bland then not wanting to finish the rest of it, and being charged.  If you're wanting water from here, ask for lemon in it, I'm somewhat of a water snob and their water tastes like tap, no matter, it won't kill you. :)  Although the place closes at 9, don't bother coming in past 8pm. I get it, I've worked in retail and fast food before, it SUCKS when someone comes in before closing. But if it's a privately owned place, and you're reaming in the money that comes through that door, and it means a family member is getting a tip, why not allow it? Especially if it's an HOUR before closing.  My boyfriend and I came in at 7:58PM about 2 weeks ago. The guy (pretty sure he's the manager) who sits at the desk, and doesn't seem to enjoy life, promptly says \"You know we close at 9, right?\" Really guy? I think we can eat in less than an hour, no need to be rude.  Meanwhile, our very kind waitress tells us to take our time, eat dessert, and relax. Why? Cause she probably overheard what the guy told us.  Like I said, I've never had a problem with most if not all of the females here. But the thing is, if you're courteous and polite to those that are serving you, it will be returned most of the time. We also clean up our table and don't leave a mess, and make sure our dishes are stacked, and at the end of the table that they can reach. I understand it's their job to clean up after a customer, but don't be a freaking slob dude. It's gross.  The best time to come is when they first open, as well as around 12PM (their lunch rush). Even though this place is a buffet, it also has a to go option. But it goes by the pound. So you put whatever food you want in a Styrofoam container and they weigh it. It seems like a rip off, cause it's just as expensive if not more, and it's per pound. Don't do it.   The motif on the inside is nice, and they play traditional music (but last time it seemed it was crappy modern music that you find on the radio, I hope this was just a fluke). The walls, windows, and carpet could use a change, or a tleast a cleansing. But with nasty people with no manners running around with their offspring, I can see why they probably feel like it doesn't matter. This place is in an area that is a shadow of it's former self (right next to the Metro Mall where they filmed Bill & Ted). So you get what you pay for.  But if you're looking for a wide selection (they have fruits, alot of desserts, and more familiar things like mashed potatoes, fries, and pizza, but I swear if I see you coming to an Asian buffet to eat that stuff, I will sass you!) and staff that aren't going to pressure you, or fuss at you, this is a decent place for the money really. I've seen other buffets start out at $12 for what these guys offer.  We'll continue to come here until we have to deal with someone or something crazy rude."}
{"text":"I use to love this buffet, but now I have a change of heart. For one the service sucks, it seems like they don't care about your well-being nor the sanitary of the restaurant. Tables, silverware, floors, and even the fancy walls by the booth tables are filthy. Food use to be great, but now they taste old, and with the way the restaurant is kept up I don't trust the cooking ware."}
{"text":"I came here tonight because I was hungry and wanted a variety of food to choose from.  The prices here are fair, and the food selections pretty darn good.  The salad bar is awesome, with tons of fresh fruit, toppings, dressings and a bunch of other stuff.  The first time I came here I ate like it was going out of style and really liked the food. They have a sushi bar, but the selection's limited.  They also have a grill where they cook stuff like it's a Mongolian grill, and its not half bad.  Sometimes the drink refills are slow, and I will admit, even though the food is good, some dishes are better then others.  Definitely a good place to go eat at with a good selection and great prices."}
{"text":"A very good buffet restaurant with good quality overall.  I loved the fact that they have little signs on each table asking guests to be respectful and not waste food to keep prices down for all."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Asian buffet in Las Vegas, the price is a bit higher then most but the selection makes up for it hands down. The food is fresh and hot. The service is like most buffets on and off depending on who is serving you. Its a nice touch to have a chocolate fountain to aide in your desert choices.  Large seating areas, clean , and doesn't have that buffet smell. All in all well worth the venture out of the strip.."}
{"text":"I have been to many buffets like this and felt that this one was lacking a lot from what I am used to in a buffet such as this. Their food was mediocre warm at best very greasy and their service was also not up to what I would call my standard. However, the one bright light in this Buffet is there Sushi offerings I tried all that they had they were fresh well made and tasted really good. But I still only give the restaurant as a whole a one-star."}
{"text":"This buffet was better the first time we went. Better selection.  Having said that it is by no means bad, the food has always been of good quality, and fresh however its \"meh.\"   Staff is attentive and my son likes the Jell-o  Its really just the same ol- same ol for a buffet, nothing to make me really want to go back."}
{"text":"A Five Star Place! no way,   People you need to get out more, the world is bigger than the Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet.  how could someone disrespect other five star restaurants that \"work hard\" for quality taste and expirence to offer their best they can.  My review is more to give argument to the five star reviews. Reasons people gave  five stars, its cheap and large amount of items to choose from.     \"I did not hear how great the food taste or abut any specialty items that are prepared.\"    I'm not saying don't eat there, all places are worth the try."}
{"text":"So far the best buffet and Chinese food I have found in this area. My husband and I enjoyed every bite. The pepper chicken, sweet and sour ribs and the beef ribs. My test is always the hot and sour soup. This was delish. Hope to go again soon.  Also had hot tea and it was definitely a tea not just hot water that seems to come out sometimes. Hope you all have a good experience too."}
{"text":"Don't. just don't. unless you like cold, days old tough Chinese. then, OK."}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated , but the food needs some work. Also , I had an incident where I was eating and one of there staff began making fun of me. I have eaten there a total of 3 times. Each time , I was mostly eating the sushi , which surprise , isn't actual sushi but cooked fish made to look \"raw\". I would've given two stars , but the mere fact that you somehow removed my original review is very disconcerting. You get one star. And I will never eat there again. Also for those reading this , the lin's seafood buffet on 51st and Bell is managed by the same company that manages this buffet. The food is terrible. So I will hope this will save you some time."}
{"text":"For the money, you can't go wrong.  Only a couple things that might be some issues. Your sushi bar area is not bad however it becomes warm in can be a problem.  Sashimi was warm as well.  Which is not a good thing and ruined it. The yogurt ice cream isn't very good, super sweet and runny.  If they fix these two items this place would be number 1."}
{"text":"If I could give this place -5 stars I would. Definitely the worst place I've ever been too. The food had no flavor, everything was cold. Terrible experience. Don't ever ever come here, waste of money. McDonald's is better than this place."}
{"text":"So we went here with a group of friends on a friday night right after work and i gotta say it was decent but not over the top. they do offer the same things that they have at Buffet @ Asia but a little less on quality. The seafood they offer needs work the snow crab legs were very cheap looking and not that fresh because how you can tell its fresh is once you start opening them they still snap on the shells these crab legs were very soft and spongy and very little meat. the fried crab was better but it was cold. One thing i did enjoy was the space here as compared to other buffets it doesnt feel cramped and i appreciate that.  When you have a buffet make sure the food is hot because people like fresh food not something that has been sitting for about 10-15 min before you bring it out. Some cool things that they did have were dim sum and sushi which were ok and the dessert here was a big selection of it from fruiot to yogurt to cookies and cake. For about $13 its a solid cheap buffet so you get your moneys worth but dont expect me to come back to this for i rather go to buffet @ Asia for the quality and for $2 more."}
{"text":"The food selection is amazing. But the bathrooms are disgusting. I don't think they ever clean them on a daily basis. They have shit stains on the walls and its just gross. I told the owner when I was there but it seemed like he was more interested in making money then keeping his restrooms clean!!!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I did the lunch buffet here on a friday, arriving just after noon.  The entire restaurant appeared very clean and well kept, including the bathroom.  The buffet was well stocked with typical, chicken-everything Americanized Chinese food, though there were several shrimp and pork dishes, too.  It looked like there was one employee dedicated to keeping the steam tables replenished.  Most of the items tasted, smelled and looked nicely prepared, especially for a buffet of this price. I particularly liked the fact that the salad section was equipped with a good selection of greens and fresh vegetables, as well as some common prepared deli salads. I did hear one customer complain that no one was available to do her mongo bbq, but an employee then got to her order immediately.   The sushi selection could be improved, but again, for the price it's acceptable and relatively fresh. I wouldn't call this place \"supreme\" but it was OK, and I'll probably be back sometime."}
{"text":"Great service and really yummy sushi. Other than that, similar to Buffet Asia.    Check out the strawberry yogurt."}
{"text":"Great food!! But the restroom smells so bad i wish they would clean bathroom more often. All the food that you eat makes you want to throw it all up and last i wish they would put a sink out so we can wash our hands after eating crab legs."}
{"text":"Good food for the value. Typical Chinese food buffet but this one has a Mongolian grill that is good. Good place for a quick Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Decent prized buffet, with a variety of options for the pickiest of eaters! Decent prize at $13.XX per adult this including drink.  The hibachi grill included as well.  It is very roomy, so even on busy nights you get seated quickly excellent for groups.  They have customer appreciation cards, you get a stamp per visit and after a certain amount of stamps you get a free buffet entry.   Chocolate fountain on occasion"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the years and it is a pretty solid buffet choice.  There hasn't been anything that has really wowed me, but it is pretty good and absolutely filling.    The setup where the guest makes their plate raw and then gives it to the hibachi cook is a cool feature of this place.  The crab legs were small and dinky so I decided not to even waste my time on them.  The stuffed shrimp was sub-par.  I don't recommend that.  The sushi was pretty good for buffet sushi.   Overall, its nothing to write home about, but works out well for groups of 8 or more."}
{"text":"The food was okay for a complete dinner, a good value for $8.00 with 20% coupon in the Chinese newspaper.   They have the typical Chinese food, orange chicken, sweet sour pork, chow main, hot & sour soup, wonton soup, and, sushi.  The sushi is filled with crab meat and cucumber, looked pretty much the same style.   Nothing fancy about it!  The only standout dishes for me were the salt and pepper shrimp, steam clams, and ice creams.  I do like their green tea ice cream and pineapple sherbet.   The hibachi grill selections were limited.  The items didn't look too fresh, so skipped the grill.  They have a so called \"Prime Rib\", don't be fooled by the name.  It was unchewable!  We were trying to figure out what kind of meat it was.  Haha....  I do give them another star for keeping the food hot and stocking the trays.  Superior service for a buffet place!  They actually have a free Wifi password on the price board.   For the price of a Starbucks coffee, you can fest all day and work!"}
{"text":"I've never seen anything like this! I never expected for a buffet to have an indoor pond it's beautiful.  I've been here more then a couple times now and I guess it's time for a review! Friendly staff , amazing food it's big and doesn't feel crowded. The price itself I can't complain me and my family love it !!  Why not 5 stars? Well several occasions I've reached for a plate only to find that it has food stuck on it or the forks/spoons are dirty. Other then that it's a great place just be carful when you pick up a plate and check it's clean before you serve yourself."}
{"text":"First time here with my Husband and food was good, bathroom dirty tho and the guy at the Sushi station sneezing and on his cell phone and didn't wash his hands after,gross we will not be back. After eating about an hour after my stomach felt funny and me and my Husband were in the bathroom with the runs."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall, lots of different choices of food. I was excited about the Hibachi I was thinking flaming onion volcanoes and whatnot, but it's just a grill they heat stuff up for you on which is still nice. Happy to have a good buffet nearby."}
{"text":"This establishment was clean around the stations of food. I did see a few flies around but in this 100 degree weather, the flies and I would rather be inside. There was an assortment of options for food. I enjoyed the wings and salad/fruit bar the most. The soft serve ice cream was also tasty. As for the customer service, the ladies were polite and took plates away quickly. Polite, clean, and quick ...fair enough to receive three stars"}
{"text":"Love this place my kids love the fish and the 2 young ladys allways so nice to my family .   5 star."}
{"text":"Food was great,clean environment and bathroom, grill and sea food grill, great sushi and  very nice dining area Not sure why other rated very low! It is great and will be my first choice whenever I'm in that area :) don't overfill your self and select your food wisely otherwise  you will end up hating it, you must give it a try"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was something to be desired. The place was busy so everything looked fresh but tasted slightly off. Will probably not be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"Very ordinary. Buffet selection very average and typical. While not bad, it's just not that good. Nothing sets this place apart from the hundreds of other Asian buffets. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Thought it would've been better but the food was not good. Food had different tastes to it and a lot of it, mainly the deserts tasted very artificial. Very good customer service but the food unfortunately, just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Okay I returned here and have some great news for all you yelpers. The food is great! So they did raise the price for the first time since they opened and it is now $7.99 for lunch... but honestly that is about normal for a buffet now and they still have amazing quality. The grill is great; still have several choices of meat and veggies, the hot and sour soup is good but not overly spicy, and the sushi was great for buffet, they even had some shrimp and red snapper out. had several different types of chicken, and all were good. the only downsides were the cheese wontons are very crunchy... too crunchy. and the steamed flounder and salmon were both kind of tough and a little dried out. One thing that has changed since the last time I was here is they have pre-scooped cups of ice cream in a cup which are free if you eat in, but you can also take them to go for 75 cents each."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid buffet... I was over at Desert Sky Mall and walked to 75th ave to get on the bus... and I saw this place. I was like.....hmm a buffet I haven't been to... and it has the same name as the one I really like at MetroCenter.... so I decided that was going to be lunch. I was impressed when I walked in; it was a nice place. So the first couple things I tried I wasn't really that impressed with... I did not like their gyoza and their egg roll was meh as well. However, the had decent teriyaki skewers and all of the various types of chicken were decent. A few things that were awesome were they had a fruit bar that was quite impressive.... fresh pineapple, strawberries, and other various fruit.... the pineapple was so good! They had a very good grill, however the guy preparing it did not say a single word. Also, they had sushi that was more well prepared than any other buffet I have been to (except maybe Tokyo and the one on Chandler Blvd) They had 6 different types of ice cream as well as 2 that were repeats of another flavor. Overall a decent buffet if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, and was amazed at the selection.  They have the traditional Asian buffet choices--orange chicken, broccoli beef, lo-mein, fried rice, egg rolls, potstickers...you get the picture, but they also have a Mongolian BBQ or grill station.  The prepared buffet foods are really good.  While I was dining, the buffet steam trays were constantly being refilled and replenished.  I would not say the food is the best, but for a buffet, and for the price, it's a great value.  The orange chicken and egg rolls were especially good.  The honey chicken is extra yummy as well.  The service was GREAT.  The servers are personable and friendly, and clear dishes away quickly, and check back frequently for beverage refills.    It was a great buffet experience.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great buffets. You get what you pay for. Our waiter was very polite and on top of his game . Beer is very cheap."}
{"text":"This place has roachs. I went with my friend on August 23, 2017. I actually ran out of the place. Beware!!"}
{"text":"This is a good selection for a good price.  A better salad bar than even the salad bar buffets nearby.  The fact that I go all the time doesn't mean much except that they're the best in the area.  The best in the area doesn't exactly mean the best ever, though.  Service can be not just hit or miss, but downright bipolar, with some staff providing exceptional service while some just the opposite.   Like most places, they cook almost everything in the deep fryer. So some days the cooks turn things out a little more oily than other days.  Sadly, they are responsible for putting nearby dim sum legends China Chan out of business.  8v("}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the name - all of these Hibachi Grill & Supreme Boofay's popping up around town are under different ownership, with quite different recipes coming from the kitchens.  this location claims to be the largest in the valley, but it must mean sq. footage or something, because the selection was lacking. There seemed to be a ton of food trays, it's just that nothing very good was in them.  A lot of repetetive dishes, a lot of starchy  filler-uppers.   Way too much non-chinese food.  If i wanted hot dogs, kelbasa, chicken nuggets, etc i'd go to Old Timers boofay, not a China Boofay.  Everything in the place seems to have an oily sheen from it's time spent cooking in the deep fryer, since this seems to be the only way anything is prepared.  The entry way is impressive looking, and if you're not really paying much attention, you may get beguiled by the flashy lights and clanking knives of the live sushi and hibachi chefs, but do not be fooled.  This is ameri-chino fare at it's most mediocre, and not worth the price they charge."}
{"text":"Place gets a bad rapbut cheap, fast, and plentiful is how it goes. The hibachi grill makes it worth the price and the rest of the food is actually pretty decent. I would recommend it if you're looking for something to fill up on. Nice people, and the sushi is good! The decor is dated and common but who comes for that? Check it out if you wanna stuff for a good price!"}
{"text":"Terrific selection which even included Mongolian BBQ, crawfish, softshell crab, and several sushi selections.  All of the food was very fresh.  Several icecream options. They played Happy Birthday over the speakers and brought my mom a cake, it was very nice.  Best chinese buffet in the area."}
{"text":"The Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet was awesome! My family and I came here for dinner on a Friday night during Lent looking for seafood options. Boy, did they deliver! For about $14 per person, you are offered a great variety of seafood and meat options. They offer a military discount too, which is great! The place is huge. There are sushi, hibachi, regular entree, and dessert sections - lots and LOTS of food.   I started out by trying the sushi. There were about 10-15 different options of nigiri, rolls, and sashimi. It was all good, but obviously not fresh. The rice was too dried out in my opinion.  I then tried their clam chowder. Delicious! There were lots of good pieces of clam and potato in the soup, it didn't taste canned at all, like I would have expected. Definitely try this if you like clam chowder.  Their salted pepper shrimp was okay. It could have used more salt. The  baked salmon was alright as well, I think even though it was sitting in some milky liquid, it still was rather dry.  I'm not a big fan of fresh oysters, but I tried theirs and I was actually impressed. My mom, who is a big fan, loved them and said they tasted nice and fresh.  The star of the buffet for me were the snow crab legs. They are offered warm and steamed. The legs have lots of meat and the meat is good and sweet! I ate two plates, haha. I was definitely satisfied with those!  Of the desserts, I tried the banana, tapioca, and chocolate puddings. All tasty. I also tried the cake roll and mocha cake. The cake roll was dry and the mocha cake had a lot of frosting, so I ate them together, which was a perfect combo, lol. They offered a few fruit options, I only tried the watermelon - good. Their sesame balls were good! Fresh and chewy, but no red bean paste inside, just straight mochi. My brother tried the frozen yogurt and said it was nice and creamy.  I am really impressed with this place. The area doesn't have a lot of other great dining options, so this place is a breath of fresh area for this side of town. I definitely recommend this place over Buffet at Asia and The Golden Corral."}
{"text":"We go here often... love the grill!!   We aim to go for the dinner time as that is when there is shrimp for grilling.. load up on the shrimp and steak ..add whatever veggies and choose rice or noodles.. hand the plate to the awesome chef.. and he goes to town!!! We love it every time.  Sushi is generally fresh and delicious. Since we use the actual grill, we don't choose too much from the buffet tables anymore."}
{"text":"We went to the grand opening and loved it. We have been back at least once to twice a month since.  There are times when the food is beyond excellent and then there are times when it is not so excellent. However, there is always something there that we enjoy and go back for everytime. They have something called the House Special, looks like a long thin spring roll. Tastes wonderful! Love the coconut shrimp.  Their dessert/fruit/salad tables are delightful. There is something for everyone here. They do have different menus between Lunch and Dinner.  I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy for my tummy!!!  Loved the tacky fountain as you walk in, lol. This place was clean, granted it has just opened. The food was fresh, the sushi was delish (for buffet) and the waitresses were really nice. We ate for two hours, well not straight eating but we were there that long. They sat us at the wall closest to the parking lot, we didn't sit by a window but it was really warm anyway. Next time, because there will be a next time, I will ask not to be sitted by the wall.  Three of us for dinner for $30...can't beat that."}
{"text":"trash. don't waste you're time or money... horrible variety and food is not good. they stole my money, too over priced."}
{"text":"I have been there few times. The food is ok not great.  The steak is not too fresh, and not in a good quality. The waitresses are not very welcoming. You have to ask for a steak knife to get it. The restaurant is clean most of the time."}
{"text":"The food was good but they offer steamed crab legs between 5pm and 8pm. It was quite obvious that they weren't enthusiastic about keeping them stocked they only cooked them about once per hour and only in small batches so there weren't many for the entire restaurant to enjoy at one time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in on Sunday to eat oysters and crab legs because in their ad said they're served \"all day\". We got there around 8 and they close at 10. We asked our waiter \"where were the oysters\" she told us that they weren't making any more food. Which was nonsense. I had called ahead and talked to the manager on the phone to confirm at what time the oysters would stop being made and she just said all day."}
{"text":"Okay so went I first went here the place was great. But it was around its grand opening so buffets are usually pretty great in the start. But from past experiences I've seen buffets go down quite fast. I was right. The second time I came which was about 3 months after the grand opening service was bad and food quality already started decreasing but overall it was still pretty good. Its been awhile since then but after today's visit I will not be coming again. All the entrees were tasteless. Sushi was dry. The hibachi grill guy was horrible. Fruits looked like they came right out of the can and sat there for days. To top it off something I never noticed was that the restroom sign said, \"RESTEROOM.\" This buffet has officially crashed and is now 1 star."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, for the second time in a row waitress was lying down in the booth, playing with her phone, never came to refill drinks, pick up plates or anything. Food is great, but not worth the bad service"}
{"text":"I've lived on the east site all my life, so when I heard about this place I was thrilled. Walking in was really awesome because have a fish pond indoors and it really set the mood.  However, when it came to the actual food I was disappointed. It was a bit greasy (which I can live with), but in terms of spicing and taste it was rather bland. I hope that in the coming months they change that because they have the potential to be something great. I will say that my dad loved, it so just know Hibachi we're rooting for you to get it together."}
{"text":"Horrible service cold food. I had to ask for more water and the guy just gave me a heads up and then he finally brought me  some water 5 min later. I asked him if he saw me he just ignored me, I asked him and two other people to speak to a manager, the hostess said the manager was on vacation. They had to lower their prices because the quality got so bad, and now their service matches the food. Not recommended at all"}
{"text":"Its all you can eat so it comes as advertized. Lots of asian food but some pizza and other general buffet food stuff.  Pretty well stocked and taste is pretty good.  Two problems- service is lacking- the hibachi guys were a surly looking lot with attitude, the sushi was not labeled and the sushi chef couldnt even say whats in each one.  Finally, the mens room is disgusting- urine all over the floor and when i went to pee i learned why- the toilet design is horrible so you end up splashing all over yourself and the floor. The whole drive home my car bow smells like a urinal. Awesome"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Chinese Buffet for a while in my neighborhood and luckily Hibachi Grill has arrived. I have been to few Buffets in which the service was as quick, friendly and efficient. A sumptuously decorated Mid Century Modern Chinese decor makes you feel like you are eating at a fancy casino buffet. Lots of attractive attention to detail. So what ? I'm here for the food.  Only drawbacks- no dumplings- fried or steam or dim sum other than pork bun- which was great however. Also, no duck, hoisin or plum sauce, and if they did have it it was hard to find. BUT- they had wonderful egg custard tarts that were sublime- I am still obsessing ove them and that made of for what they lacked in other areas.  And the food did not disappoint. Great tot and sour soup with a perfect subtle taste of vinegar, delicious and hot cheese wontons, hell, they even had fried sweet plantains that were as good as my Cuban mother makes.   Keep in mind, it's a buffet and I arrived it was the beginning of lunch so everything was hot and fresh. They offer the usual suspects from standard buffet fare, but all in high quality. Lots of shrimp and beef, and although I did not try the Hibachi Grill, it looked very appetizing  with lots of happy diners waiting in line to get their fix. The sushi bar was well stocked and fresh. Remember, it's a buffet, not Ra in Scottsdale. It was all very fresh. No \" low sodium\" soy sauce ? So what.   All that, as well as 8 flavors of very premium ice cream for $6.99. God, I love America ! For a Chinese Buffet with this price for lunch, it is as good as it gets.  I walked out after meeting my new Yelp friends Rand, Norm, Mike, Robyn and Lynn extremely happy, satisfied and pleased as a pig. I will be back."}
{"text":"Why don't you one star  people stop bitching about the service.  It is a cheap buffet morons.  I bet you go to WalMart for the cheap prices and bitch about the long lines and poor service there too!  Most of the people who work here are illegal and making $2 an hour.  Look if you want take out this is the best deal because after 9PM EVERYTHING in 50% off on takeout! So tonite,  instead of $4.95 a pound I am loading up on Salmon, shrimp, and egg rolls, chicken at $2.50 a pound! Where can you get 4 pounds of shrimp and salmon for $10?   At the market you have to pay $7 a pound and have to cook it too.  So if you live near here wait until 9 PM  run down here and load up, take it home.  Then you don't need to worry about  bad service.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst buffet that i've ever been to. First off when you pull in there is a big hole that is near impossible to avoid so turn in slowly. From the outside this place looks busted. It wouldn't be a place that you would just stop in and check out driving past it. We walked in and were seated by the hostess who also took our drink orders. From there our waitress picked up our ticket and brought our drink orders to the table, never, from the entire meal, saying a single word to us. So we took it upon ourselves to wonder over to the buffet. I struggled choosing what to add to my plate. Everything looked old, greasy & soggy. I was excited when I found the fried rice. That was the one thing that looked normal. From the buffet I tried the Shrimp (w/ Head), Beef w/ Broccoli, Some Sort of Beef Roll, Sesame Chicken, a Spring Roll, Stuffed Shrimp, Fried Chicken Wings and the Beef Roast. Not a single thing tasted good. One bite of each and I was done. And the Stuffed Shrimp, when you look under the bottom, looks so disgusting and oily, didn't even try that one. I was just so turned off by this place. The chicken wing was the only thing that I got that I felt was edible.   So I then decided to wonder to the front to try the Hibachi Grill. I figured I should atleast be able to eat that since they're cooking it fresh. You grab a plate and start adding the Starch, Veggies & Protein that you want them to cook. They had Rice & Noodles as your starches. I went for the rice first, but trying to scoop it up it was in large clumps and was hard. So I decided to go for noodles instead though I typically don't eat the noodles. The veggies did look fresh so I added a bunch of those. But the proteins weren't labeled. I didn't know which was pork, beef, chicken, etc. The only thing that look familiar was the Shrimp so I grabbed a big scoop of that and kind of took a wild guess at the steak, which I ended up being right about. I handed him my plate, he didn't say a word to me, and he proceeded to cook my food. I decided to head to my table while I wait to avoid awkwardly standing there. Who wants to be that girl just hanging out at the buffet? lol! Plus I figured it'd take a while for my steak to be done. So after a few minutes I head back to check on my food. My plate was sitting out front the grill with customers leaning on it.  *sigh*. Skeptically I take my food back to my table & still decide to try it. It tasted literally like nothing. No sauce, no seasoning, just nothing. My steak was raw. I figured since it's hibachi they would cut it up. But no, just a big lump of steak place on top my food. The steak was so chewy & tough I couldn't even finish my 1st bite. Later as we walked past the Hibachi again, we noticed that you could pick different sauces and tell the cook what you'd like. Why wouldn't he ask me when I gave him my plate?? So yeah, I was over the hibachi. I ended up just going back to get a plate of Fried Rice & a few Chicken Wings. That ended up filling me up.  We also noticed while we dined that they had a sign on the Napkin Dispenser telling you not to waste food and if you did there would be a penalty. Really??? This is a buffet. Of course there is going to be wasted food. We took our bill to the front to pay and dared them to charge us a fee but they did not. My bill with the buffet and a drink came to around $10. Save your money, this place wasn't even worth that."}
{"text":"If the parking lot is ALWAYS full on weekends and holidays and there's often a crowd waiting in line to get in, it's a really good sign. Especially for Asian buffets.  Yes, it's got all of the typical Asian buffet items, but definitely a whole lot more to choose from. I think 7-8 tables? The hibachi grill is great!  There is a cook who is ALWAYS there to grill your food for you.  The sushi is always being made so you know it is fresh.  And so many different ice creams to choose from.  New food is always being brought out so you know it has not been sitting there a long time.  The place is always clean, waitresses are always friendly, and we feel very welcome even on the most crowded days, especially with two babies who need high chairs. For this area, I truly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Not the best of places to dine at. Most of the food are just heated and waiting for someone to pick at it. I will admit the only appetizing dishes here are the sushi and crab legs, that's mostly because those items are popular and have to be restocked and served again. Other than that the food looks like left overs and not real exciting to eat. The servers are another thing. Not friendly and are mean. When asked for refills, the lady had an attitude like she was gonna DO something nasty to your drink. Another good side note for this place I guess is the oranges. They were fresh. I would suggest coming during the first opening hours of this place, by dinner time most of the food looks like a pack of hungry people ravaged the place and left you with what ever was left. The bathrooms are something else. It's not healthy for people to eat then use the restroom to find it all torn up and not maintained. That was disgusting! They need some reflection on this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now, I have no disagreements with it. Love the food and the prices and the service."}
{"text":"I went to the Hibachi Grill for a meeting, and was amazed at the size of the place.  It seems to take up the entire space that was a Jungle Jim's playland years ago.  The food variety was excellent, the dishes I tried were good, and I did not even make it to the area where they grill your food to your tastes or to the desserts.    Our group was in the party room at the back of the restaurant, and we received excellent service.  The wait staff was very attentive, and removed our used items quickly and refilled drinks promptly as well.  When we asked if we could have the music turned down a bit, it was taken care of immediately.  All in all, I felt this was a good restaurant and I'll go back with my family."}
{"text":"OK, so this isn't healthy fare by any means, but it works when I have a Chinese buffet itch that I need to scratch. You first pay for your meal, then take your ticket to a hostess, who then seats you. A waiter comes by to take your drink order and brings it. You take it from there, right over to the buffet.   On one end is a sushi area, then go from there to desserts, noodles, chicken, seafood, meat, veggies, etc. It's your typical stuff: General Tso's chicken, beef and broccoli, honey shrimp, crab wontons, mushrooms, sweet 'n' sour chicken, etc., etc. and a lot more.   A negative is that you get your food from only one side, instead of the food being in an \"island\" set up where people can get food from all sides. If you were to come here during a rush, I imagine it could get annoying."}
{"text":"This made for a nice date location. The waiter was extremely attentive. The food was mainly really good especially the meat. The fried banana was not good, neither was the sushi. But I suppose it's to be expected that sushi at a buffet won't be the greatest. Overall, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Wasn't great, but wasn't terrible. My girlfriend explained that buffets are better than anything you put in your microwave but worse than what you would get at a normal restaurant. I have to say I agree. I have only been to a couple of buffets and this one is about the same thing I expected. Average. I can't say I recommend it."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went on Saturday morning July 16th (11am opening time) to get some hot fresh Asian food. Lots of customers were already there but not sure why unless they were all first timers. Some hot foods were cold in the middle like the egg rolls, fried dumplings, etc. Actually most of the food tasted reheated, now that I think about it. Maybe left over from the night or day before. NOTHING SEEMED TO BE CRISPY. Sure there was lots of food but it was not as good as we hoped. The meals cost us about $16.00 for both of us but we didn't get $16.00 worth of food. We tried a little of almost everything that looked good but nothing was worth seconds. We didn't try the Hibachi grill though. The best part of the meal was the plentiful and fresh fruit bar. Can't really cheat on that. The restaurant was pretty clean except my table was sticky on the edge. The bathroom was clean but I suspect it was because it was still early.  As we left we wished it would have been better as we live nearby. Oh well."}
{"text":"The only good thing here is the veggie rolls other than that I would not recommend anyone to come. The food is plain and cold. There is food all over the counters where's the food is located. The chow-mein is very greasy."}
