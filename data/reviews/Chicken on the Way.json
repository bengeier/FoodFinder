{"text":"Good chicken, fries and fritters. Reasonably priced and there is always something on special. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait for chicken, but this is okay as then you know you are getting freshly cooked bird!  I like to hit this place for a quick lunch or supper, or more commonly a post-pub feed!"}
{"text":"What a joke this place is. It was never good but I've gone back hoping it was a hit or miss thing, but this last experience has left me just wondering how they can even serve what they do and have any sense of respect for anyone. Overcooked, dried out,, smallest pieces I've ever seen anywhere - seriously, and there were so many feathers cooked right into the crust! I called in to explain this to them , and they said bring the meal back, and we'll give you a free meal.  What? For more dried feathers? A 16 piece meal should not contain only 2 \"larger\" pieces either. The rest was feathery wings and drums, and I kid you not, microscopic. There was more feather than chicken.. One puny piece was even missing a chunk of the chicken, like ripped off of it.  Are they buying sick little discount chicken ? Bottom line, I'd strongly urge anyone to avoid at all costs. I ended up throwing it out since it was just too unethical to feed to my kids. Actually made me feel horrible to even consider presenting that to any of my family. I've learned my lesson, never will I return to this place."}
{"text":"Honestly I am a big fan of their corn fritters, and gravy, however after my experience with this particular store I doubt I'll be eating any of it for a long time. The lady at the till looked inconvenienced by the customers, as well as I had to repeat my order three times. Upon arriving home I noticed there was no chicken in the bags, so I called back the location and was quickly yelled at and accused of lying about my order. I understand she didn't hear me repeat the order three times, however there was no reason to yell at me or accuse me of lying. I won't be returning to a store that screams at customers for their mistakes."}
{"text":"My parents used to get Chicken on the Way from the original location in Hillhurst(?), the one with the no-longer-permissible Sambo character painted on the building. I only recall the corn fritters from those days, but stopped by here over the holidays when I decided I wanted some fried chicken and the local KFC was closed.  As unhealthy as it no doubt was, the chicken was cooked well, and the portions of french fries were ample. You couldn't eat here every day without dying, but for the occasional treat of fried chicken, I felt there was great value. My favourites are still the corn fritters."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, the bang-for-buck factor at Chicken on the Way is quite high. For $8 most can leave comfortably (or uncomfortably) full.   The menu is small and basic but what it does, it does very well. The chicken is fantastic, the fries taste very fresh and have a good crunch to them and the corn fritters were outstanding. The staff was overly pleasant and took time to chat while the orders were cooking. He (the owner) was also adamant that if anything was less than what we were expecting to let him know and he'd make it up to us. A simple gesture, but it felt genuine and was something I appreciated.   I would definitely come back if I was craving fast food. Seeing as the menu is entirely fried it's not something I'll hit weekly, but once a month I can see myself giving it a whirl."}
{"text":"Next to my great grandma's southern fried chicken, this place is the best! It's the best you can get near and far."}
{"text":"Much better than all the fried chicken I've tried. Their fries aren't good but I enjoy them to some degree, their chicken: Now it gets complicated, some days I come in and I get this perfect juicy chicken, other times i come in and I get this greasy and flavourless chicken (still better than KFC's) that makes me feel like I just drank grease. However these guys corn fritters, they must be made with sorcery or something, because they are amazing and I enjoy them every time. I would rate 5 stars but sometimes they aren't that great. Oh yeah, they also have decent fish and chips."}
{"text":"Now that there are 3 or 4 Chickens on the Way in Calgary, there is just no excuse to go to KFC anymore.  Chicken on the Way tastes better and I believe it's cheaper too.  Tried out this location last night, having been to the original location a bunch of times.  It looks exactly the same, except for looking cleaner and newer.  They definitely wanted to keep their style that has worked for them. I don't think the fries are super-great, they're not the least bit crispy, maybe some people like them that way, but the the corn fritters are delicious and chicken is capital-P Perfect."}
{"text":"So far so good! I've been there twice now, and the chicken has been absolutely delicious.  The fries aren't nearly at the same quality, but who's there for the fries?  The gravy is excellent, so I ended up dipping my chicken in the chicken gravy and throwing out the fries.  I had their fritter once, it was really good, even though it seemed like it was over fried.  I'm sure it's just because it was still new and they haven't got the timing down yet - hopefully that will change for the better next time I go!  Not bad at all, and great location as there's no other fried chicken near by!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary my whole life, and I've only ever been to the original Chicken on the Way once  - as a ten year old kid with my Dad. All I remember about it was that I said the corn fritters tasted yucky, and he told me that that was a travesty. So, 15 years later, a new Chicken on the Way opens up right near my house and what choice do I have but to check it out?  I walked in and saw that I was the only customer - and immediately I worried. I used to work in fast food and usually no customers meant that you'd be eating food that was old, soggy and awful. But the staff was wonderful. The girl who took my order was helpful and polite, and the cooks (you can see the entire kitchen) were chatty and funny.  It turns out my dad was right all along. As soon as I got my Snack Pack ($8 including a drink) I opened it up and tasted the corn fritter. Dear Lord, I am converted! The outside was perfectly crisp and the inside was dense, moist, and just a little sweet. I ate it so fast I am amazed I could taste it at all. The chicken was equally stunning. Crispy skin, juicy meat, somehow not the slightest bit greasy. The fries were thick cut and tender, with lots of small crispy ends scattered in there as well - the best of both worlds. Even the ketchup somehow tasted better than normal.   Seriously, I ate this in my car in the parking lot, and the windows steamed up like that scene from Titanic. It was THAT good. I am quite literally drooling as I write this. Go get yourself some chicken right now."}
{"text":"I love going to this location.  I have stopped by here at all times of the day and even if there is a line up they are still quick and friendly.  It doesn't matter if my order is big or small it's always ready quickly.  Teh longest wait I have ever had was 10 minutes as they had to start a completely fresh batch.  This means the chicken is always fresh too.  I feel even with KFC, Mother Browns, Popeyes, Fritou and Catalina as occasional alternative stops in my neighborhood this is the best chicken of all of them.   The salads here are better than the other chicken shops too.  If you like fresh fries from fresh cut potatoes then this is the place for you too."}
{"text":"I could not stand it any longer...\"Must have fried chicken\". Despite my cardiologist's warning, I turned off of Macleod Trail and headed straight  for the little Chicken on the Way storefront. It is a relatively new location and I had to see how they had switched things up from the old 14th Street original which I hadn't entered in years.  Upon walking in the door, I looked around to count the differences. OMG...deja vu. Even the cooking oil smelled exactly the same. The yellow boxes are all stacked on the counter, the condiments are laid out in the corner, the corn fritters were still on the menu and the three piece dinner still sounded as inviting as ever.  Despite my best effort, I could not resist this latter draw. To round out my trip down memory lane, the server even wrapped my yellow boxed order in brown paper. It is reassuring to know that some things don't change. Everything tasted just as good as it did on my first visit in the 1970's."}
{"text":"will never order kfc again. cheaper prices better food and LOVE the corn fritters. can be a little greasy at times. but its fried chicken guess its to be expected."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I haven't been to the one on 17th ave. S.E., but I have been to the original location over the years. The guy working at the front of the store, and takes your order is a pretty nice guy. He welcomes you, with a hello and is eager to serve you. The two locations that I have now been to look fairly similar inside. You enter the door and head to your left, where you'll find a pop fridge and looking ahead the familiar stacks of empty pre made take-out boxes. The fryer's are against the back wall.  It's strictly a take-out store, and the guy that I spoke with when ordering today told me that this was week number 7 that it's been open for. To the far right of the counter, before you leave they have a fork dispenser and condiments for the chicken. Along with napkins etc. The one thing I noticed when I got home after ordering the three piece meal (Can't remember the name for the meal). It was missing honey for the fritter. Other than that, it was usual tasting fried chicken with a good portion of fries. Overall I would have to say that it wasn't to bad, and I'll probably be back. Just not every week, It's one of those things like KFC. You feel a little guilty after eating it. (because of the Grease). In concluding, the chicken was juicy, the fries plentiful and tasty, the corn fritter tasty as well !  Oh and some more the original COTW, I guess it's been around for 50+ years. That's what the guy working at the front told me."}
{"text":"Kinda greasy a little over cooked but damn it this place a good facsimile of the original store. Once in a blue moon for a solid grease fix you can't go wrong. My only complaint is that my chocolate milk was sour. Oh well it's all about the chicken and corn fritters."}
{"text":"One of our family favourite fast-food go to places. Chicken crispy and delicious, good gravy, corn fritters are fabulous...only dislike is soggy fries. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was so bad I was flabbergasted. The woman at the counter was so rude! When my husband and I asked to separate our order the woman had the audacity to say \"You're making things difficult aren't you?\" So to make it easier for HER and to not have to deal with her negative persona any longer we abided by her wishes and put our food in one box. Her attitude continued all throughout our transaction and others.   It blows my mind that someone would still have a job after such rudeness. I would call the manager and complain but they'll probably offer a coupon for more greasy slime they call chicken. No thanks. I'll do this review and hope and pray others will see it and avoid their lovely establishment at all costs!"}
{"text":"the best fried chicken and corn fritters in the city! The price is good for the quantity and quality of the food!"}
{"text":"The most convenient stop for a takout. I find their chicken better than KFC's bc it's not too oily."}
{"text":"Very good. Much nicer than KFC, and the fritters haunt my dreams with their corny goodness. They do seem to rush the food if they're too busy though."}
{"text":"Pretty basic deep-fried fare that doesn't have much to make it outstanding, but I guess having been around for at least 40 years is kinda like a routine that has stuck. No need to do more with it.  The last time I ate it - in 2016 - I got slightly unwell feeling. I think I must have eaten some bad fat or whatever. Seems that the chicken is more fat than in the old days, but my greatest reservation is the nutritional quality of it all. I can imagine force-fed birds just loaded with toxins and free radicals that do rad things to our flesh.  As not had the corn fritters yet, only 2 stars on this whatever..."}
{"text":"I don't have their chicken very often - a couple times a year - but when I do it's always great. Hot & crispy.   I don't have the fries - not a fan. A lot of people like their fries, I'm just not one of them.  [UPDATE - Jan 25, '18] Thank you Bruce, I'll try that."}
{"text":"As far as fried chicken take out joints go. This one is pretty good. I don't give 5 stars because they could always be a bit more welcoming when you enter. But that's pretty typical in take out joints. Chicken is better quality and better flavour than KFC by far. I love the \"softer\" fries as this is a true sign they are really homemade. I'm not sure if they have honey for the corn fritters because I always just go home and don't ask. But for anyone who doesn't know that's how you are supposed to eat them. Dipped in honey. Therefore I love their corn fritters. Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I would actually just go there for fritters.  Since we live fairly close. It's a frequent go to and a good choice for bringing supper home. I also love the old fashioned packaging. It feels like you're opening presents when you get home."}
{"text":"My reaction is to give them two stars because when I think of Chicken on the way I just think \"Meh\" it is nothing special it is just fast food and when I see it on the plates of the pictures I took I am like wow that looks really bland and not colourful at all and unhealthy and it does not make me want to eat it.  However, I gave it three stars because of the fritters alone. They are pretty darn good.  I don't know if I would come back anytime soon.  I only came here because I had a coupon."}
{"text":"The last time I went here, the staff were not all that friendly. When I got tot the counter, the person there just looked at me until I decided what I wanted. I didn't get a greeting or anything!  Despite this, the food here is good for fast food. I would definitely choose this place over say K.F.C, because the quality of chicken is simply much better here. I also highly recommend the corn fritters, which are a good treat to compliment the good juicy chicken.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Until a year ago my fried chicken experience was limited to KFC and a couple of trips to the States. I have lived here for 8 years and heard lots of people talk about how good COTW was but since I had never had good fried chicken I didn't get it. Now...... I totally get it!  I don't know how they do it but the chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and always cooked perfectly. The fries are good, I am not actually a huge fry person but I eat these ones so that's an indication that they are good. But the star of the show for me is the fritters..... I could eat about 100 of them. They are sweet but also savoury and crispy but also soft. The are fried pieces of heaven in my opinion.   Since our first trip here we probably get dinner there every three weeks or so and I don't see that ending anytime soon. Comfort food is right...... Delicious!"}
{"text":"I wonder if I've just been unlucky the 3 times I've been to this 'hot spot'  The chicken has always been greasy as the Bog of Eternal Stench, or as dry as a the hottest part of Hell.  The fritters would be alright if I didn't have to drown my mouth in water just to be able to swallow each bite.  The fries are soggy about 3 minutes after you get your order.  Such a shame as I love fried chicken.  And now my butt is itchy.  This is going to be a bad day."}
{"text":"I went there and they were out of CHICKEN SERIOUSLY but at least we got a fresh batch of pretty good tasting chicken"}
{"text":"Last weekend, my boyfriend and I have ordered Chicken On the Way for dinner. The one we've been visiting is the McKenzie Town location. We ordered Family Combo to go. We had a good experience than our expectations. Chicken on the Way is the fast food restaurant in Calgary and the servings are generous and delicious chickens, which is the same style as KFC.  We arrived the Chicken On the Way around 5 pm. There was a huge lineup, but the line went very fast. After waiting for few minutes, we got our order. We had a family pack, which included Chickens, French Fries, Corn fritters, Gravy, and Vegetable Salad. The chickens were oily and crispy. French Fries were OK and nothing excited. Compare to McDonald's, I like McDonald fries more. The Corn fritters were my favorite. They were sweet and crispy. Dipped corn fritters into the Gravy. The taste was awesome. The prices of the food were very cheap around $28.  In summary, we had a great experience at Chicken on the Way."}
{"text":"well, it's take out only... so no place to sit. chicken is ok. less fatty than KFC but still tastes like fried chicken. fries become soggy, and on the overcooked brown side. corn fritters i don't find good.... they are dry and really no taste.  It comes in a large box....to make up for the small space the chicken takes they fill the rest of the box with fries.... so we never ever finish the fries.    but... still love the honey and frank's red hot!!!"}
{"text":"My buddy had to run an errand at lunch and this was in the same strip mall. I asked him if he'd ever eaten it, he said, \"Once. The fries are alright.\" So I gave it a shot... Snack Pack. Deep fried chicken, deep fried corn cake and fries. It was ok. Let's face it. It's gross food. I feel gross right now after eating it. I threw out half of the fritter because... I couldn't do it to myself. So if you like gross food, like Stampede midway gross, then you will probably like Chicken-on-the-way. Service was fine and fast. Chicken was cooked. The  chicken batter was a bit bland but less greasy than KFC. The fries were alright. I won't eat this stuff again unless necessary."}
{"text":"I had a spontaneous moment today, which lead to me stopping by Chicken on the Way.  I've never eaten food from here before and didn't know what to expect.  I usually stick with boneless meat, so this truly was an adventure for me.  I told the lovely older woman behind the counter that I'd never darkened the doorway, so she took me under her wing (no pun intended) and made sure I understood the menu.  It's not complicated but I had a few questions.  I ordered a single wing to say that I actually tried the chicken and was stunned by the fact that you can choose what chicken part you want.  I also ordered a small potato salad and one corn fritter.  The woman kindly told the deep fryer guy to throw in some complimentary fries, as I should try those too and if I like them, surely I'd return.  This was very sweet of her and I couldn't have asked for friendlier service.    The food was piping hot, for starters.  The chicken was greasy, as most fast food chicken is, but I liked that it didn't taste salty.  The potato salad wasn't chunky, but instead reminded me of course mashed potatoes.  Despite this, all of the right flavors were there.  The fries were good too and I loved the corn fritter.  If I were a celebrity being paid millions to gain weight for a movie role, eating copious amounts of corn fritters to do it never would have crossed my mind until today.  I would return to Chicken on the Way just for an order of these.    My lunch indulgence cost me $3.00.  What a pleasant surprise!  The box of calories I purchased cost less than a Starbucks coffee.  Little lady, you knew what you were doing."}
{"text":"Classic fried chicken.  Really good always crispy. The corn fritters are super good.  A Much better alternative to KFC"}
{"text":"Always good chicken, tasty fritters and good sides.  The staff at this location have always been friendly and quick to get your meal together. The last time I was here they gave me coleslaw instead of potato salad. No big deal and the only time I've been here that there has been an error.   Every once in a while we'll get some coupons in the mail which is a good nudge to remind us that this location is in McTowne."}
{"text":"While service is always really fast here the food isn't worth it. Every time we go their oil is so old that all the food is almost black and soaked in grease. While the chicken is sometimes still edible, the fries are a complete waste of money. If you really want Chicken on the Way, go to the location on 14th st"}
{"text":"move over KFC, bigger, crispier, jucier! sometimes gotta wait. gotta eat the fries right away or else its soggy."}
