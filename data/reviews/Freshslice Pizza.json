{"text":"Freshslice pizza definitely isn't the freshest of pizzas nor do they even have a proper oven, but I love the different varieties of pizza they do have. The pesto and garlic options are delicious and I really like the tomato sauce they use. The meat lover and garlic lover pizzas are my favorite. The balance of toppings to sauce to cheese to crust is pretty good so you really get all the flavors packed in one bite. 

They have 1$ slices on tuesday (pretty big slices too!) and they give out FREE slices of pizza and coupons on random days. I've probably had at least a pizza's worth of free pizza. hehe

Not the best pizza in Toronto but not the worst. Good for cravings or just a simple meal. :D"}
{"text":"I wanted to like them, I really did. The price was right, the people were friendly, and hey... it's pizza. How badly can you mess up pizza?

Unfortunately they answered that with: Very badly.

The crust is thin and flat, almost as if it failed to rise properly. The cheese is slightly grainy and has no real cheese flavor. The toppings are reasonable, although the mushrooms on mine looked a bit like rejected small fragments from the bottom of the barrel.

And then there's the sauce. I don't know what is wrong with the sauce, exactly, but it tastes both sweet and smoky in an extremely unpleasant way. I can't put my finger on what the flavor is exactly, but it has an undertone of rot to it, and an aftertaste that is best described as sickly.

Unfortunately only two pieces of the entire pizza were eaten. The sauce was simply so bad that it was inedible.

If you're looking for pizza pick somewhere else, there's a pizza nova a block away and although they're not so great themselves they at least produce something that is edible."}
{"text":"In a city where chain pizza is reminiscent of cheese slathered cardboard, Fresh Slice serves up a nice change.  Is it the best pizza you'll ever have? Of course not.  It isn't oozy, greasy and gourmet like Bona Pizza.  But it is good and it is very cheap at 1.57 a slice or 10.49 for any eight slices in the display --this amounts to, but is cheaper than, a full XL pizza.  

I love that the dough is soft like bakery pizza and that the tomato sauce has just a little bit of heat to it.  I think it might just be canned sauce with some chili flakes, but in concert with the thick cut, fresh toppings (and hey, did I mention the price?), Fresh Slice has won me over and is now my go-to place to grab a quick bite on the College strip."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizza in town. Better than pizza pizza and other big franchises. They're always friendly and very accommodating and not to mention very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I had to laugh when I saw another reviewer say that he disliked Freshslice Willowdale's pizza and next time he'd go to Mamma's Pizza down Yonge Street in the same neighbourhood.

Mamma's Pizza was the first pizza I tried after moving here, and it was so mediocre that I would never go back.  But a friend from the area then suggested Freshslice, and while I used to get pizza maybe once every three months, now I have it two to three times a week.

The $5-for-three-slices deal is great, but it's also the flavour that draws me here.  Freshslice's Pesto Chicken and Butter Chicken pizza are so tasty that I can devour them even after carrying them home and they're not completely hot anymore.  The crust is indeed soft and thin, and not the kind of deep-pan, crispy crust I like from Pizza Hut, but it's still a great slice, even better than the famous pizzas I've had in New York.  And the one time they didn't have the Indian-flavoured toppings, I settled for the pepperoni and even that was quite good, well above average.  I've since also tried the Canadian (sausage, mushroom and ham, I think) and the Hawaiian; both are also at least as good as any other place I've tried anywhere.

The one time I did get a drink here, it did indeed taste watery as another reviewer wrote.  But the pizzas will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This rating is based on the terrible delivery service since I haven't eaten the pizza that was just delivered. The order took over 1.5 hours to arrive, the driver showed up in the back of a cab - I know, SUPER WEIRD -
and the pizza looked like it just came out of a clothing dryer, except it wasn't warm. On top of that, they gave me a Pepsi instead of sprite and wrong toppings on the pizza. Stay away from this place. Period."}
{"text":"To say taking a chance on this lot was a mistake would be a phenomenal understatement. We made the order at roughly 7.10pm, and over a half hour later received a call from Just Eat to inform us that the place was not open but had left themselves online for no good reason whatsoever. Shortly after again, we received another call letting us know that they had only closed for an hour or so, at 7pm, and not informed anyone of this. Because it is clearly such a wonderfully ran place with nothing but the finest of intentions for their clients.

So finally, EVENTUALLY, the pizza arrived an hour and a half after we ordered... we really wish it never had. One pizza which we had specified to have no onions had onions on it; another we had specified to have no mushrooms on it had mushrooms. The bases on them had more moisture than a used Kleenex, the toppings combined to form a mulch resembling a 10 year old bag of cabbage, the cheese... wasn't cheese. Whatever it was, it wasn't cheese. And the fries were undercooked, cold and soggy all at the one time as if to form a perfect concoction of awfulness. Imagine dipping a potato in a puddle of  mud for an hour and you get a good idea.

The brownie was nice though. The problem is though, that we ordered two. So after waiting for an hour and a half for about the worst pizza the world has probably ever seen, we were missing food on top of that. When I called them, \"Johnny Johnny\" as he referred to himself answered and told me the reason for the delay was \"the chef went out for a while, so when he came back we just rushed your order and forgot some things\" - well doesn't that just fill you with confidence! He did at least he would have the driver send out the missing brownie (after initially just offering us credit, but let's be honest - this isn't a place that gets a lot of repeat business).

Ten minutes later, we received a call from Just Eat informing us that this shower of clowns would not only not deliver the brownie, but that they also refused to ring us themselves. All in all I don't know what was worse, the pizza or the people making it."}
{"text":"I too have traveled around the world but I actually ate all kinds of food. Because of this I know what good food tastes like. Fresh slice is neither good food nor good pizza. In fact, this is easily the worst pizza I have ever had and that includes frozen store bought pizzas.

They do not have a giant pizza oven at this location (and I would guess they don't at any other location) but instead the same rolling heat oven you will find in a pizza hut at a movie theatre or in Quiznos. That's not how you cook a pizza unless it was prepackaged which these obviously were.

Fresh slice has all the freshness of a just opened McCain pizza box. The cheese is tasteless. The crust is dry and bland and the toppings have obviously been frozen for quite a while.

The proof is in the price and you certainly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally describe fries as \"tepid\", but these McCain shoestring fries were in fact tepid in temperature. They may have at some point been in an oven. 

The wings were standard pizza shop wings, so they were tiny and soggy. Why pizza places can't do good wings is beyond me. 

The pizza was delightfully cardboardy. 

The Pepsi was by far the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Really tiny, but seating outside that's good for summer. The pizza is one of the best I've had bar none if we're comparing the chains. Just amazing. It actually tastes like something instead of just a mash of tomato sauce and rubbery cheese.

They take extra care with their pizzas for take out, too, baking it a little differently to ensure it still tastes good when you get home. Nice little place."}
{"text":"Cheap pizza.  You get what you pay for.  No doubt a hot spot for kids in the area.  Pre-made crusts, watered down pop. They call them XL slices, but really a small to medium at best. 2 Slices and a small drink for $4.50."}
{"text":"A slice for just under $2 is a pretty good deal, but it wasn't a slice I'd come back for...

First off, they're pretty stingy with their toppings. Looking through the glass at their available selection, it was pretty sad to see most pizzas were so skimpy with the toppings that you can see the dough underneath...

Second, they didn't heat it for long enough. Usually a decent joint will put your slice in the oven to make it a perfect piece of pizza heaven. But here it barely melted the cheese...

The pizza itself tasted just okay. I found the sauce to be a little heavy with the garlic though. 

On the plus, they're clean with a nice contemporary interior. Unfortunately, that's just not enough to get me to come back..."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good here and super cheap! They have so many deals like 2.99$ for 1 slice and 1 pop. Or 2 slices and a pop for 4.19$ 
They have a variety of ready to go pizzas like veggie pepp, deluxe, meat lover. Prob 5-6 different pizzas to choose from. 
They have fountain pop with the usual brands. Went for dr.pepper today. 

The only downside is that it's a super small place so there is 1 table for 2 inside and 2 small tables outside. Not a place you would want to eat at. It's super hot inside too. Once we ordered I waited outside in the breeze. 
Doesn't seem like there's AC or possibly because the ovens are on. 

Very fast service, no lines. 
Would definitely come again when I pass by and want a cheap eat. 

No parking tho as its on a busy street at yonge and Sheppard (beside Subway)"}
{"text":"For the price you pay....the Quality is really good. They have a variety of pizzas and their chicken pesto is surprisingly good. It is also somewhat healthy for Pizza because their crust is whole wheat. The owner Ravi is a really nice guy who does whatever it takes to satisfy his customers. I have ordered over 100 pizzas at a time for corporate functions amd they always come on time and always fresh. Fresh Slice is better than Pizza Pizza and more healthy. Try it out the next time you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Cheap cardboard like pizza made in a conveyor belt oven. I live in the building above this place and it breaks my heart to see people ordering pizza's and slices here. Seriously, don't people have any TASTE? Frozen tasteless ingredients and the dough is never cooked well enough on that conveyor.

I wish people would stop patronizing this place so they'd close and something good open up. Sorry Freshslice but I'd rather walk 1km away and get decent pizza from Mamma's or Pizzioloio."}
{"text":"I like this place. The pizza is not stellar. It tastes great but the crust sucks being a little soggy due to conveyor oven use. They have slices ready to go that are outside the normal. Beef and cheddar, pesto and cheese, bacon and mushroom, things that are a little more exciting than just the pepperoni you find other places. The service has always been super friendly. The BEST part, though, is the price. I've been paying $1.25 per slice (any slice, any day the window says). That means lunch costs me a grand total of $2.63 taxes in. I'm very ok with that."}
{"text":"Tastes very strange, not good. The whole wheat crust with the not cheese (I won't call it cheese because it didn't have any cheese flavor) was disappointing and the sauce tasted disgusting. Order was 15 min late because he couldn't find our place, but he was polite enough so that's the only thing that was good. Really disgusting pizza. The first slice was OK, but the next was really disgusting. Don't eat more than a slice, I felt sick for the whole day."}
{"text":"I used to stop in here sporadically when I lived in the area, walking by with a toonie in my pocket and looking for a quick snack, it usually did the trick. For old times sake stopped in this week. Slices are a tiny bit more expensive at $1.90 + tax and on Tuesdays are $1.25 + tax.

The problem is that both the beef and hawaiian slices I had were pretty lacking in both flavour and satisfaction. I don't remember why I was so fine with the place before (probably the bbq sauce they didn't have on the counter like they used to), and I'm still rooting for them in the local pizza wars since a freaking Pizza Pizza moved in right next door.... But yeah, its cheap, just not great. Approach accordingly."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good my visit. Any 3 slices for $5 is a deal tasted fresh to me and the slices sell out fast!!!"}
{"text":"I had to take 3 or 4 takes before I finally stepped inside Freshslice. $1.00 A SLICE (Tuesdays only)!? Is this place for real? I had a feeling I was part of a Just For Laughs gag or something, honestly it's crazy!

The pizza isn't great but they've got some good slices (they don't skimp on the toppings) and two slices would be a good addition to any already boozed up stomach.

I won't be looking for Freshslice when I'm walking down the Little Italy strip but once I get liquored up, you damn well better know where I'll be going after!"}
{"text":"Kind people running the place, however the food wasn't the greatest. 

We kind of love our pizzas, and we make them weekly, home made. 
Feeling lazy we went out for some Freshslice. 

The pizza is definitely edible, and the dough has a very interested texture to it (Still undecided if I like it or hate it).
Id like to say it's a bargain at 3 for $5 however the mediocrity of the pizzas kind of even out with the prices of other local, smaller pizza joints."}
{"text":"Say, does Toronto need another pizza chain? No. No way. Does it need another good pizza chain? No. The operative word in that second question is \"another\". There isn't even one. Freshslice, sadly, does not really actually step up to what Toronto probably doesn't deserve. Sorry, any city of 2.5 million that bows before Pizza Pizza has long, long given up the right to expect or demand a great pizza chain.

Freshslice's only saving grace seems to be cost. Any slice for $1.55. Slices aren't as big as Pizza Pizza but you can pork out pretty okay on 4 slices and come in a buck, buck 'n' change cheaper than 2 (eg 4) slices at Pizza Pizza.

Freshslice is similar to Pizzaville in terms of the crust. It's pleasantly soft and doughy. Like every pizza chain, sauce is a ketchupy afterthought. Is it so hard to create a zest sauce? Look, drive 400 km to Windsor, order a bloody pizza from any local mom 'n' pop and run the sauce through a mass spectrometer and just copy a real sauce.

This particular location in North York seemed to be under construction for the better part of a year. Did they hire the same construction company that renovates TTC stations, platforms, and doors? 

It's also a mighty tight fit in this place for someone who wants to munch a few slices on prem.

Still, it's better than a kick in the head, Pizza Pizza, the even worse Pizza Nova found at Finch/Yonge, or the fly infested slices on offer at Pizzaville down at Yonge/Sheppard. .

Meh. 32 more years and I can finally die."}
{"text":"Fresh Slice pizza is somewhere to go if you are on the go or want a quick and easy lunch, I wouldn't recommend it for somewhere to order a whole pizza from but for a slice or two its okay.

I can recall seeing the sign for this location for a year or more before it actually opened, I thought it was just going to be one of those failed establishments even before they opened, but surprisingly a couple years later they are still around.. 

It really is just a grab and go location, very tight and tiny, be aware if you come at busy hours like lunch because they sometimes run out of slices from the school kids."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite. Was incensed to find that (crappy, over priced, tasteless) pizza pizza has set up shop next door. Don t let em take over! Please support this great business!!"}
{"text":"How could a person who lives in a city that is home to some very fine pizzerias ever like a chain place like Fresh Slice?

I know.  Crazytown, right?

But it's true, and I'm not overly ashamed to admit it . . . maybe a little bit overly ashamed to admit it.

Yet it still doesn't change the fact that Fresh Slice has some excellent utility pizza and some of their specialty pizzas are kinda tasty.
The thing is when you couple Fresh slice with their $2 a slice offers, I become a fan.

Are we talking local organic ingredients here?
Will you ever find them serving a baked farm fresh egg on a bed of arugula that's resting atop a chorizo and jalapeno pizza?

Highly unlikely,
but it's still pizza
and like some comedian once said,
even the worst pizza you ever had was still probably still pretty good."}
{"text":"While the pizza here is not anything to write home about (but what do you expect for the prices they are charging), my issue with them has less to do with the pizza and more to do with their service.  They always advertise good deals, but whether they will uphold that good deal varies dramatically based on the individuals working at that time.  I have successfully ordered some of their specials without any problem (in fact, some of their personnel are quite lovely to deal with).  I have also had such problems with the person taking my order that I have given up and walked out.  

All this being said, their pizza is not bad (considering the prices they are charging).  But don't expect high quality ingredients or anything resembling decent service."}
{"text":"Cheapest pizza in Toronto! 
The quality is extremely good considering the price and even is above average with respect to the more expensive competitors"}
{"text":"Was pretty happy to see the owners of the Pacific Mall location reopen here. This restaurant is fairly cramped and at best 3 people can eat inside. Great staff. Overall for the price it's good pizza, period. 

Conveyor belt oven delivers soft crust never cardboard consistency. The toppings are fresh and are not skimpy. Good cheese. In my opinion I find the base tomato sauce is a bit tangy/sweet but doesn't really deteriorate the overall taste. 

Personally, I go for the Garlic Chicken Feast, Veggie Feast, and just regular Cheese. Regardless of what you get they have a unique taste when compared to other stores. They offer Heinz dipping sauce which is a nice plus, not some in house clear container with salad dressing.

Great specials such as 3 slices for $5. Overall would recommend Fresh Slice. Good pizza for the price. Wish there were more locations available. Would definitely go back If I'm in the area. 

I'm a Fan. 4/5"}
{"text":"Well, they won us over on the way to the AGO with their sign for a slice of pizza for $1.90  NOT BAD!!!!!  The slice was a bit small, so if you're anything more than \"snackish\" I'm going to recommend that you order 2.  The slice was pretty good, but a little heavy on the garlic.  All in, not a bad place for a quick snack"}
{"text":"For today's lunch I wasn't looking for anything fancy, honestly it didn't even have to be that tasty, I just wanted something fast and cheap before my next appointment. So I walked into FreshSlice lured by the sweet smell of pizza and the tantalizing low price on display. And what I got was one of the best slices of take-out pizza that I've had so far in the city, far surpassing my expectations. It wasn't burned or dry like the usual lunch offerings, the toppings were generous and the taste was great. The staff was quick and efficient, real pizza guys who knew their offerings and took the time to give a recommendation. 

I was sure I would come back after the first bite, but after using their free WiFi to check-in to that \"other\" website I was thrilled to get a free slice just for visiting for the first time. Now they had me hook line and sinker, since I got to try another great slice. 

I would recommend this place as the best taste-for-the-buck around."}
{"text":"This is my local pizza joint, while they do not have the best pizza, it's decent. The prices are awesome and it's so convenient. There are more food options than pizza although I haven't tried them yet. If you are hungry and passing by a Fresh Slice, I recommend stopping by to try it out."}
{"text":"We're talking RIDICULOUSLY cheap pizza. I was walking past the Wilson 96 next door -- who lets you bring in outside food BTW -- when I noticed a sign promising sub-toonie slices of pizza. \"I'm buying,\" I announced to my kid sister, and we walked into this tiny spot hopefully.

In addition to pizza they also serve salads and wings. They had quite a few varieties of slice pies on offer including two types of veggie and a some meat heavy ones. The 'za wasn't the freshest when we showed up (at the late hour of 9pm), but it looked reasonable. Besides, I was foaming at the mouth for some inexpensive pizza. At that point, I just wanted to taste the value.

The reason for the cheapness is twofold: 1) the slices are really small (i.e., you need two to constitute a typical serving and 2) they aren't very good. Not bad, mind you, but the pizza seemed almost homemade. (As in amateurish, not awesome.) Really soft crust and toppings applied haphazardly.

But I got what I wanted. Two slices for under a fin. WIN.

Obligatory Title Pun: It's a SLICE.

Menu Readability: There is a hell of a lot going on here.

Need to mention: They take debit and credit.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm a GD cheapskate sometimes."}
{"text":"Cheap and Cheerful.

I like the variety.
I like the great prices.
I like the location.
I like the owner.
I like the hours.

I have ordered from here for friends and for corporate functions and I am still a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Be warned as the staff often close an hour early whenever they feel like it. so even though it is supposed to close at 11, you need to call ahead in case they close at ten that day. Lost a star for that.

People come here for the 3 slice for $5 deal. Butter chicken pizza is pretty good, as is the ground beef with garlic sauce.

There is wifi but only some of the staff know the password. Power outlets south of the counter across from the drink machine."}
