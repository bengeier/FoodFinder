{"text":"This Corned Beef Shop is actually great! My sandwich was moist; it was huge and enjoyable. The staff is excellent, fast and friendly.  I enjoyed waiting for my sandwich talking to them. The cost was just like the flyer. I recommend that everyone goes and enjoy a piece of greatness. It is indeed world famous!!"}
{"text":"First of all the flyers states \"Biggest & Best Corned Beef Sandwiches in the world\"  The flyers has a huge pic of a corned beef sandwich!  The flyer also sates \"Jumbo sandwich includes a bag of chips and a pop.  I didnt get a bag of chips or a pop, cause they were extra!  The sandwich was very tiny, nothing like it had advertised!  I'm very disappointed for paying $10 (Coupon state $3 off the sandwich---nope!) for a very small sandwich!  On top of that!  They were so lazy, they only cut one piece of my bread.  Highly dissapointed, please stay away, stick with the people you know."}
{"text":"They're just OK.  I felt like for $10, I could have gotten more meat, a soda and that they could have at least toasted my bread.  Not a wide menu selection either."}
