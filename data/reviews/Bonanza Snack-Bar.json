{"text":"We were a bachelor party from NYC, so we know good food. This place is awesome. Marc the owner is great and really takes time to prepare each sandwich. Here are a few that were big hits for us. Porky's, Chan-Chan, Gary Carter, Pestoso. We are all having withdrawals..."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL.  Basically a food truck in a stand, Bonanzas focuses on making food delicious via perfectly grilled bread.  Had the hot mama and dog, and immediately appreciated the attention to detail for quality ingredients.  Meat to bread ratios were perfect, and it was one of those meals that was so good you felt hungrier after you finished eating.  Only advice is that this is a one man shop, so plan ahead if you're ordering with a large group."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had here was both delicious and reasonably priced. I was able to chat a little with the owner who speaks Spanish which was a plus to me. I'll be looking forward to try more items from their menu as I live and work close from this spot and I'm really getting tired of the mcdo. cheers."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, I came across Bonanza. Nice and cozy spot. The guys who work there are very friendly. Awesome service! The sloppy joes are amazing. I recommend \"Fat Bastard\". I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Tres bon sous marin! Choix interessant de viande de porc et poulet, j'aurais apprécié quil y ai du boeuf aussi.et pouvoir avoir la possibilité davoir le pain chaud ou grillé"}
{"text":"Petit casse-croûte qui sert des sous-marins et des sloppy joe, i.e des sandwichs fourrés avec une espèce de sauce à spaghetti bolognaise. Premier sloppy joe pour moi alors c'est difficile de comparer mais ça va satisfaire les amateurs de viande. Service très sympathique."}
{"text":"Les sous-marins et les grilled-cheese sont savoureux. Chaque sandwich a été pensé avec grand soin et c'est la même chose pour leur préparation. Le proprio est hyper sympathique et on adore la musique. Ce n'est pas fréquent de commander avec du The Pogues! Quand t'es libre, t'es bien, t'es heureux, forcément, tu veux en donner..."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall with an excellent selection of sloppy joes , and subs . Honestly one of the best I've had in a very long time , Fresh bread and amazing sauce . Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Everytime I have visitors from other cities, I take them to Bonanza to show them how good the comfort food in Montreal is. Sloppy Joes and the Subs are unreal! They leave you wanting to go back. And Marc, the owner, is super friendly and genuinely passionate about making the best sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ate here today and it was mega delicious comfort food served up with a smile on small stools in the sun. I'll be back for sure, it's so great to have another inexpensive, unpretentious, fresh lunch option up in this area. There is a list of sloppy joes, a list of grilled cheese, and a list of subs and based on a cursory examination I am determined to sample them all. Today we tried the sloppy joe with slaw and pickles on a fresh baguette roll - amazing classic sloppy joe. Perfectly tomatoey, slightly spicy, with excellent ground beef and a little kicky with the pickled veg. We also shared Long Island Sub - chicken, bacon, mayo, some magic sauce, other good things I don't remember but everything was good about it. Both were kick ass sandwiches, the sloppy joe has me considering going back there again today for dinner so that's the clear winner but everything was win.   There are some chips and cokes available for sale here and of course it would be cool if there was a little more variety in those departments but I kind of love that they keep the accoutrements simple because it's all about the sandwiches. It's a sandwich BONANZA."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest. The sloppy joes are amazing. My personal favourite is the Gary Carter although everything I've tried has been delicious. It's dangerous that it's so close to home...."}
{"text":"This cozy hole in the wall will definitely satisfy anyone looking for delicious comfort food. Their menu offers primarily three types of meals: Subs, Sloppy joes, and Grilled cheese (there are also hot dogs on the menu along with a few other things) so if you're looking for a light meal to pair with your diet, you probably wont find it here. The variety offered in each category will surely please everyone tastes - just don't expect seating for a party of 12, this place really is an order counter with seating for about 8.  Notables :  - Fair prices and the menu has the items listed with the taxes included - Quick and efficient - everything is prepared right in front of you in a timely fashion - Having a horrible day? Have a bacon/pickle grilled cheese and turn that frown upsidedown!  It also helps that the man who made my food was really nice - I did not get his name.  I will definitely come back"}
