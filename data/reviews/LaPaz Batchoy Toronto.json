{"text":"I've seen this place a couple of times in passing and was curious as to what they served so I went in to try it. The service was excellent. The owner was very nice and inviting and explained what dishes they served. I decided to try to chicken steak however what I received was not exactly what I expected, not for a $12.00 combo meal. When I think chicken steak, I think whole pieces of chicken with onions and sauce, etc., but I simply got two chicken skewers, rice and a salad for the aforementioned price. 

Sounds mildly exciting? In reality, no. I will say the chicken was tasty, albeit small, but my rice was overcooked, some parts were so overcooked it was mushy and the salad was basically the kale salad you buy in a pack at costco or the grocers without all the fix-ins. I was really disappointed in the quality of the food for the amount I paid. I was really hoping to find another amazing hidden gem in the area and although the service was A+ quality, sadly the food not so much. Can't say I'll be revisiting."}
{"text":"They are VERY over-priced for a small portion of food compared to what other restaurants would serve for the same price. The price would have been ok if it's justified by the taste, but the food did NOT taste like authentic Filipino. A few more blocks at Wilson and Bathurst and you'd find A LOT BETTER taste, options, and prices! I had mango shake which tasted diluted, fishballs with sauce that had too much cornstarch, it had the consistency of mashed potatoes, and chicken batchoy that had a LOT more chicken bones than meat!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  The store front and advertising look so impressive, but when we got there (6:30pm which is a normal dinner time) the choices were very very limited.  Like to JUST batchoy.  

We ordered a batchoy soup, took it home, and mixed it like the owner said, only to find that it was insanely spicy and inedible.  I recognize different provinces have their own recipes, but this was just out of control.  Nothing like what I ate when I was growing up, or whenever I visited Roxas.  Feeling like a wimp, I gave my husband the rest of the soup since he can handle the heat, and he also said it was crazy spicy as well.

We ordered a bibinka for dessert, only to find there were no salted eggs baked into it.  It was just one pleasant surprise after another with this place.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"The batchoy is super delicious, all I can say its really authentic taste from Iloilo. I'm definitely coming back for the isaw as well and the  soimai is just a mouth-watering yummylicious. The price is definitely just right and reasonable."}
{"text":"I dropped in to Lapaz Batchoy for take out the other day on My way home from work. I met one of the owners when I walked in. I ordered the tapsilog which is an all day breakfast, and I also picked up and order of the chicken inasal, shoma, and pork spring rolls for my wife. While I was waiting I noticed the restaurant had a very family like atmosphere to it, I mentioned that to the male half of the ownership, we struck up a conversation and it seems like they are very humble down to earth people. I also mentioned to him how clean the restaurant was. He seemed genuinely greatful as we spoke. When my order came he invited me to bring my wife on Saturday for the Boodle  fight. When I got home and tasted the food I was absolutely  floored by how good the food was. I don't like too spicy of food and was pleasantly surprised that it was not too spicy at all. My wife found it too be the same. We both agree it was the best we have tasted. As for the Boodle fight , we may just take him up on his offer. We will definitely be back for sure. Great Food guys."}
