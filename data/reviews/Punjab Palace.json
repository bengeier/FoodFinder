{"text":"Service is avg to below avg. they didn't bring our drinks until reminded. One of the order was wrong, which was promptly corrected. We asked for 1 mild and 1 hot entree. Both turned out very mild - disappointing. We were mislead by prev reviews. Need to remind myself that most yelpers who review indian restaurant try the meat dishes, which could've better. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Overall, very good food and service. Some of the dishes were a bit Asian tasting (chili paneer and ginger chicken) but food was fresh, tasty, and came out quick on a busy night. 
Definitely a keeper for that area."}
{"text":"Restaurant was packed even it's Weekday. We the family of four ordered Lamb & Beef Briyani which was Ok\"rice is sticky\". We liked Nan so much but chili chicken was not up-to our expectation. Service was slow and server looks too casual. Price is Reasonable."}
{"text":"We started with an order of vegetable samosas served with a sweet and spicy tamarind sauce and chimichurri. Gigantic deep-fried dumplings filled with a more than generous filling of spiced potatoes, lentils and green peas. I'm not going to lie, I can make a meal out of these things, hit me up with three of four of those bad boys and a drank, and I can watch Men's Olympic water polo and hate myself into tomorrow."}
{"text":"It is a pretty popular place, we waited for almost 30 min on a weeknight for a party of 6 so I would recommend getting take out if possible or making a reservation. I cannot say enough good things about their food--there was not one disappointing dish and we tried quite a few. We had ordered the paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, chicken biryani, grilled meats (lamb, chicken, etc.), and garlic nan. We are from the states and we have seriously considered driving back up JUST to come to this restaurant. 100% worth the trip"}
{"text":"Forget about downtown fares like Le Taj, just go to Punjab Palace with your favourite bottle of wine in hand. Wait a while to be seated because this place is super busy, and enjoy the best Indian food in town! Go with a larger group and order more variety, try many of the dishes in their extensive menu and you are in for some delightful surprises. Place is not fancy, but clean, well kept, not tacky, comfortable and the staff is super friendly and efficient enough. Went there many many times, never disappoints. Last time April 2016, with a family group of 8, and the waiter at reception was extremely helpful securing a table for us in reasonable time, despite the busy line behind us and the packed room."}
{"text":"My sister's favourite Indian restaurant in Montreal (she lived in India so she knows her stuff).
Service is ok, food is great, very close to métro Acadie in case you don't have a car."}
{"text":"Great nice and cheap Indian place!"}
{"text":"Oh so good! 

We enjoyed our first dinner so much that we went back 3 days later (\"weren't you here earlier this week??\" haha). Somebody else had recommended Saag, which I'd never tried before, but oh my goodness TRY THE SAAG!! It's revolting-looking, but one of the tastiest things I've ever tried. Plus the lamb is much more tender than chicken (butter chicken was delicious too, but I always find the chicken a little dry). 

And the samosas? 2 for $2 -- we had them with dinner and then took two more home with us! They are so flavourful, and even after sitting in the fridge and being re-heated the next day, they were still moist and delicious. That's impressive!

Naan is awesome, roganjosh was an interesting try (spicy!), we never had to wait for a table (although we came at 6:00 -- by 7:00 the place was packed), you can bring your own beer or wine... my *only* negative note is I didn't love their chai. For $2/cup I think I'd skip it and just focus on the deliciousness of saag :D"}
{"text":"Excellent food at good price. We had to wait. The naan and the rice extra like everywhere else. Samosa was great but others in the group found it spicy. Also don't forget bring your own alcohol. I wish I knew that ahead of time. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food yet horrible service. They simply gave us a bottle opener to open the wine ourselves. When we asked for a doggy bag they gave us a stack of stirofoam bowls to fill ourselves. Butter chicken was one of the best I've had. Will probably go back anyways."}
{"text":"We love it. It's our fave Indian place. Great Indian byow. Once you're seated it's very fast and welcoming. Just don't sit and wait forever for your bill at the end. Go up and pay when you're ready. That's how they roll."}
{"text":"Good little restaurant on Jean Talon - they have decent service and do all the staples nicely. 

Warning - if you order for pickup, the little bastards won't make it until you actually physically show up, forcing you to wait 45 minutes for your food. I guess too many people have called to order and then never shown up, so beware."}
{"text":"Overall, I would strongly recommend Punjab Palace to Indian food lovers and/or adventurers. According to my first experience there (and it won't be my last one), the value versus the quality is something to consider. They are generous with the portions and all the flavours are very present. I will definitely come back and try out other dishes though just by curiosity.

{"text":"I come here mostly for the thali so my 5 stars are for the thali. The price is very reasonable and the butter chicken was heavenly. Since I'm not Indian, I don't know what butter chicken is supposed to taste like, but this restaurant's version of the butter chicken is one of my favourite: very buttery, a bit sweet, and I didn't find it spicy at all! The waiter was also very accommodating: instead of the tandoori chicken, I asked to have extra butter chicken and my request was granted. The restaurant across the street (Chand Palace) wasn't as friendly and charged an arbitrary 2 dollars to replace the tandoori chicken with butter chicken..."}
{"text":"Just don't go there! Chand Palace is 20000 better and the service much better. Somebody ordered something grilled. The whole place was full of smoke!!! We couldn't breathe and we were all coughing, no apologies from management. Nobody opened the windows! I know good  Indian Food and this place is just as commercial as any Tendoori...."}
{"text":"Seems that in MTL you really have to visit Parc-Ex to escape the over decorated, over-priced Indian restos, and to that end, this one satisfies. Somewhat aloof service, but they promptly took our order.  We wanted desert after, but couldn't find a server.  

For the record:  BYO beer, as well as wine.  Pay at the front after.

Food was amazing.  Garlic naan, dahl, chili paneer all were excellent.  Enough to stuff 2 adults: $25 after tip!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Bring your own beer/wine. Had the classics and they didn't disappoint. Would recommend"}
{"text":"This is a very nice little restaurant that I've been to at least a dozen times. The prices are good, the service is kind of a hit or miss, depends on their mood that day. And the food... WOW! Try their butter chicken with garlic naan, you won't regret it. It's the food that keeps me coming back even though I've experienced really meh service on some occasion."}
{"text":"The best indian spot in town. I tries tge tika masala, kadai, butter chicken and the whole chicken. All the plates were amazing. I would definitely recommend going there before 7:00pm otherwise it will be packed. But service is quick !"}
{"text":"Bel endroit avec un service agréable et courtois (et aussi alerte, je dirais, puisqu'on a ajouté et modifié des éléments de notre commande à deux reprises sans qu'il y ait de problème). J'ai surtout aimé les samosas végétariens, délicieux et juste assez goûteux, et la soupe Mulgatany, pour laquelle j'ai cependant un avertissement : elle est très épicée, alors papilles gustatives sensibles s'abstenir - mais si vous vous sentez d'attaque, allez-y, elle est excellente.

Tout n'était pas parfait, cependant, malheureusement. Les entrées et la soupe ayant été épicées et pleines de saveurs, je m'attendais à la même chose du plat principal. Mais tristement mon poulet au beurre était juste OK, rien pour sortir de l'ordinaire, pas fade mais dans une moyenne qui déçoit un peu, compte tenu des débuts plus prometteurs.

Ceci dit, je crois que c'est un restaurant qui vaut un détour et qui peut satisfaire les amateurs de cuisine indienne. Je n'ai pas été renversé par ce que j'ai mangé (sauf la soupe, à essayer de nouveau), mais j'ai été satisfait."}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch so the service was excellent since my girlfriend and I were the only ones when we arrived. We quickly ordered one veggie thali for her and one non-veggie thali for myself. The non-veggie thali came with butter chicken and savory well spiced lamb and a daal which was also great (and I'm not a fan of daal). My girlfriend had a great very fresh  tasting and looking palak paneer (beautiful not over cooked bright greet colour) which was my favourite item, spice wise, which I can neither adequately name or describe, except that it was intricately spiced well beyond any dish that I've had there or any restaurant in that area (large pieces of cinnamon bark and cardamom pods present which was really nice).    
Veggie thali was $5 and the non-veggie was $6."}
{"text":"Punjab Palace it absolutely the best bang-for-buck ratio possible, and having said that you don't sacrifice on quality, taste, or authenticity either. This place does biryani like nobody's business, the portions are huge but you won't be choking for air when you get the bill. Believe it or not, two can eat here (and I meat EAT, like you may have to unbotton whilst leaving the resto) for $25 tip in. 

The waiters are attentive, but good family-style service aside, their food is absolutely delicious, I can't honestly say I haven't enjoyed every single thing I've had, and I've pretty much done the menu. But then again, this is food you will respect in the morning! It's spicy in all the right places, and the fact that you can bring your own wine (for free, some of us Montrealers take this for granted!), and works well with large groups too. 

Their (classic) butter chicken is worth it alone. I am a butter chicken snob and this one fits the bill. Garlic naan is a must. And the point about reserving ahead is valid, but if you happen to drop by unannounced and they can't accomodate, there are at least 2 acceptable places in the immediate vacinity that will feed you. But this one is definetely worth the wait if there is one. 

Note to the reader! I'm a HUGE fan of all things Indian so this doesn't really bother me, but just in case you're sensitive to these types of things... this resto doesn't have the best ventillation and the wafts of kitchen air spill freely into the dining room. Prepare by wearing something that you can easily clean after. And I mean this with the most respect, but they could definitely invest in some better fans. But all that to say no matter what, this place is worth it. Hands down, the best Indian in Montreal."}
{"text":"Le meilleur restaurant indien que j'ai visité jusqu'à présent (et j'en ai visité plusieurs)!

Nous avons pris les samosas en entrée et l'intérieur était exactement comme je les aime, soit en purée -au lieu de morceaux consistants que l'on retrouve dans ceux des restaurants plus commerciaux- et juste assez épicés.

J'aime me faire mes propres thalis en commandant différents items et j'ai choisi Baigan Bharta (aubergines en purée avec épices et tomates), Chana Masala (pois chiches et épices) et Aloo Gobi (pommes de terre et chou-fleur dans des épices indiennes). Chaque item était savoureux, pas trop huileux et bien dosé niveau épices.

Déjà hâte d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for tasty Indian food in Montreal at a reasonable price (quite inexpensive compared to others). Loved their paneer pakodas, chilli paneer, paneer tikka masala, naans & chole bhaturas."}
{"text":"The waiter was really polite, and the service was fast and efficient. The place seemed not very well lit and a little too dark for me, and their washrooms are smaller than my closet.

The food was delicious, and the portion was gigantic. Everything was seasoned with so much spice and love, the lamb curry was pure ecstasy. I love how they grill their naan, slightly charcoaled and a crispy outer shell with a softer inside.

The butter chicken was slightly dry, but the taste was good, and the sauce was pretty thick.

The food are really cheap, but their flavours aren't cheap at all. The garam masala and the cumin powder stands out immediately when you take a bite into the lamb. The lentils and cauliflowers complemented the meat dishes wonderfully.

You can bring your own wine and beer, which is extremely convenient for gatherings with families and friends."}
{"text":"My go to Indian resto in the city. The food is delicious and very affordable. Plus, it's a BYOB. Triple win! 

Honestly, after being lucky enough to have homemade Indian with the in-laws, my spice tolerance and Indian tastebuds have definitely grown. Punjab Palace may not be as good as a home-cooked meal, but it definitely is delicious. The spice level is nice and the dishes are authentic. 

Only downside is the lacklustre service. Honestly, there are two particular male waiters who seem to truly hate their jobs. You practically have to be very persistent to get their attention and be served. Nonetheless, Punjab Palace serves up some of the best Indian in the city, so it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Punjab is another good Indian in the neighborhood. I always take to go but it's a bring your own wine. I don't like too much the look of that restaurant. The only reason why I pick this place sometimes is for their Kormas. You won't regret!"}
{"text":"I headed to Punjab Palace while visiting Montreal because as a vegetarian Indian food is always a safe bet for me.   It was easy to reach from the Metro, another plus.  When I arrived in the neighborhood I saw that it was a heavily Indian ethnic neighborhood with many little restaurants, but they had not been listed or reviewed on Yelp so I stuck with Punjab Palace.

I was on my own and didn't get any weird looks or comments about asking for a table for one (believe me, it has happened).  However, it took about 5 minutes to get a menu, and then another 10 minutes before I could order, even though there were only a few tables occupied I could not get the waiter's attention.  I received my own little pitcher of water, which I greatly appreciated.

I ordered the vegetarian thali.  It had chole (chickpeas), palak paneer, and khumb matar (mushrooms and peas), along with raita, naan, and rice.  I have never had a thali without a dal, and was a bit disappointed to see it missing.  I don't care for Indian dishes with peas in general, but the khumb matar was good for what it was.  The chole and palak paneer were quite good.  I was also disappointed that there was no dessert, as this is also something you generally see on a thali.

The food was definitely fine, but nowhere near the best Indian food I've had and somewhat below average.  Along with the slow service, this gets it 3 stars.  

It was quite cheap ($8.50, I think) and you can bring your own wine.  For a couple or a group that is a boon but for one I was not going to bring an entire bottle of wine.  Note that you pay at the register in the back of the restaurant, rather than having a bill brought to your table."}
{"text":"We've been going to Punjab Palace for about two years, sometimes weekly. My husband craves the street food of Mumbai, and in five years being abroad this restaurant has been the most authentic, dish after dish. Their appetizers are fantastic, and every curry we have had here has been on point for the Punjab style. The service can sometimes be slow, and weekend evenings can have a huge line, but it's so worth it. It's also BYOB, so take advantage as desired. We've tried every Indian place we could find in Montréal, and this place has the best food, and at a great price. If you love quality, I'd suggest getting individual curries, and don't bother with the Thali, where the same curries seem to lack the same level of care in the cook."}
{"text":"I love Punjab Palace! If they delivered I would have it much more often. Their butter chicken is perfect, the lamb curry too, their palao rice with spices, fried onions and green peas is the best around and their eggplant curry is my favorite. I've never tried their thaly dishes but they look great. The recent renovations have improved the look of the place, but when I was last there it looked like they had difficulties handlin the new influx of seated guests and the weird light wall in the back was pretty trippy, in a weird way. So you might want to call ahead and take out."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night with my family for my birthday (because Indian food gives me life) and b o y was it crowded. Especially because we were a group of 4, we had to wait for around 20-30 minutes. I recommend reserving a seat or going on a non-peak timing, when I last went there on lunchtime on a weekday, so I got to enjoy all the good food without the wait at all. 

The food here is always really good, I had the palek paneer and the vegetarian thali the last time, which was awesome (the palek paneer was one of the best ones in Montreal in my humble opinion) but I got out of my comfort zone and ordered different dishes this time. As the appetizer, we got a pani puri, which was so nostalgic since I used to have it in Malaysia. However, they don't have enough of the potatoes for the filling, which was kind of sad. It wasn't as spicy as I hoped for it to be as well. It was still really good though. We got a tikka paneer masala, chana masala, and chicken curry (for my non-vegetarian family) for the entrees. The tikka paneer masala was phenomenal, I dream of it till today. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty for me and it satisfied my Indian food craving instantly. The chana masala wasn't too special for me, especially after the tikka paneer masala. My family liked their curry chicken too. The price was quite reasonable too, I believe it was less than $60 and it fed my family very well.

The service is quick and friendly, which is impressive since it was such a busy time. I also thought it was really smart that they had this carpets that would guide the waiters and waitresses when they bring stuff to the tables. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

The ambience is a mix of casual and cozy, especially with the people talking not too loudly. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to Indian food lovers. It's family-friendly, BYOW, and has awesome food! (Bring your own wine opener though!)"}
{"text":"Had supper for the first time at Punjab Palace. Very clean restaurant, very good portions. Their butter chicken & garlic naan are to die for. There's not really service, they put a pitcher of water on your arrival, a bottle opener so basically you have to open your wine, which we really don't mind since it's really cheap for the price you're paying. Very good portions, we were 4, ordered about 6 dishes and we were full for about 80$ tip included. Best part is byow!"}
{"text":"C'est bon, c'est cheap et c'est un AVV :) J'ai mangé dans les restos indiens aux alentours et cela reste mon préféré :) Essayez le poulet au beurre il est délicieux!"}
{"text":"It is another usual and typical Indian restaurant on Jean Talon Street. But as usual, it got the authentic feeling.

The service was friendly and good. Everything was quick and efficient. 

We ordered pani puri as an appetizer. There were 8 pieces for 4$. It was so good that we wanted another platter, but we needed to save our space for our main dishes. My sister had her chicken biryani. Flavors and its aroma were filling up our nostrils. My sister enjoyed the dish very much, but it was a lot of food for one person. I think she ate 1/3 of it and the rest she took it for take out. I had the vegetarian Thali which includes naan, mixed vegetable curry, daal, paneer masala curry, cucumber/lettuce salad, rice and pakora... all this just for 10$. Every single item were very delicious. My tummy felt happy! 

Nice restaurant, good service and delicious food! Recommended!"}
{"text":"The Punjab Palace is  my favorite Indian restaurant in Montreal (out of, say, the dozen or so that I've been to, including the more expensive Taj downtown).  I've probably eaten there more than any other restaurant in the city over the years but that probably says even more about their prices than it does their food (but not about its vicinity - it's a bit of a hike north and not too accessible to public transportation). It's not only bring your own wine (and beer), but it's pretty hard to get out of there spending more than 15 bucks per person with tax and tip (including appetizers, main course, nan, etc).

On the other hand, I'm not sure that I agree with the review below that claims the service is good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty bad. Come to think of it, it's just outright awful. I've waited twenty minutes just to get a menu (having to wildly flag down the server). Even when the places is half-empty, the service is still pretty bad. But if you factor the price in, you can accept it with zen-like serenity.  However, I'd advise that the restaurant is  not only bring your own wine but preferably bring your own wine opener too.  We started bringing ours because we struggled so many times to get the attention of the server to come over and open our bottles.  Once the bottles are open and alcohol is flowing, waiting is less frustrating. In fact, the last time we did that, our waiter ended up borrowing ours. Of course, he disappeared with it and then we had to hunt him down to get it back when we were ready for the next bottle.

But enough about bottle openers. The Punjab has a fried fish appetizer (damn if I don't forget what it's called) that's spectacular. The only dud is the vindaloo which is not only not spicy but somewhat flavorless.  Everthing else is a winner."}
{"text":"This place was so Awesome that my wife craved for the food that we wen the next day."}
{"text":"What we ordered:

Strawberry and Mango Lassi
Lamb Curry
Palak Paneer (Spinach and tofu)
Chicken Tikka masala

My boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. We got there at around 5:30pm, and had no trouble getting the table we wanted. That being said, the restaurant does get busy at around 6-6:30pm.

The dishes were accompanied by their delicious Naan bread baked in their clay oven with a generous portion of seasoned white rice. We opted for the garlic Naan, which is very fluffy and pairs well with the sauce. Our food came out quickly and was warm and fresh. Everything was flavourful and rich. The Lamb curry, we were told, is their signature dish. It turned out to be my favourite. 

The portions offer great value for money. Their prices are inline with the other Punjab restaurants on Jean-Talon.

The service was excellent. Our waiter was knowledgeable and helped us navigate the menu, which was helpful as my boyfriend was new to the cuisine. We were recommended the Lassis and it turned out to be a great suggestion.  They are a bit like a mix of milkshakes and smoothies but made with yogurt. 

Overall it was a great experience, and we had a great time. This is now one of our new favourites."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and found this place. Truly one of the best places I have yet to find. Butter chicken, palak paneer and chicken tikka masala is what we ordered and it was great. Customer service was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I would probably say this is my favorite Indian restaurants at the moment. There are a couple of things to note: their strengths seem to lie in the tomato-based sauces and in anything with spice. The shrimp korma we had was lacking in flavor and depth...I would pass in future. Everything else was really good: samosa, chaat papri, shahi paneer, butter chicken, naan - all excellent. The mixed vegetables had a good flavor, but can we stop using pre-cut frozen veggies in future? So with that, a 4/5 star rating. Not perfect, but really good overall and I am seriously in love with their chaat and shahi paneer."}
{"text":"Of significant frugal prominence, the Thali lunch spread willingly deals a valuable effort. Their seven dollar Chicken Curry Thali would fare as good as any better famed establishment. The plate is apportioned into 5 shares of various serving; cook veggies, a papadum chip, a tandoori drumstick, curry chicken and basmati rice. All rich and savory except the rice must commit itself to more fat. It needs BUTTER."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past but this time I came to try their lunch thali plate...what a mistake.
I came on a wednesday a little after noon, the place was 3/4 empty and the staff were at their usual spot, all grouped together around the cash register whispering. 
Not at all a very welcoming attitude. 
Our waiter was a mumbling low talker dressed like a young thug from the street.
Absolutely no class to be found here.
We order our food and he grunts away with our menus.
I start looking around at others that have their food and notice that all the naan breads seem to be burnt. 

A sign of things to come.

Our thalis arive seperate from the naan which comes several minutes later, burnt and nowhere near hot at all. Seems like they were just in a basket waiting for the last 15 minutes to be brought.

The butter chicken was as mentioned by others VERY SWEET and dry, WORST I've ever eaten.

The rest of the thali consisted of an oily vegetables side, tasteless rice, ICEBERG LETTUCE trying to pass as a salad, dry and room temperature tandoori chicken, yuck.

All in all a completely dissapointing tasteless meal served by a lazy uninspired waiter in a creepy restaurant.

You're better off taking your $12 elsewhere, anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Montreal. The Naan and lamb curry dishes are very delicious and flavorful along with the chicken tandoori dishes."}
{"text":"Solid authentic Indian food. I bring Indian clients there all the time and they say it's comparable to what they eat at home in India ! Great service, and bring your own wine. Can't miss!!!"}
{"text":"Very small, muggy restaurant (NO A/C) reasonable prices, but nothing is included with the main dish, though  accompaniments are very  cheap; the naan, including whole wheat, is only $1.50, specialty (garlic, etc.) $2.50, rice $2.50, .and do you get rice, enough for 4 people!, good to bear with n mind. I ordered a ginger/lemon  chicken dish..could not discern any of the aforementioned flavours, but the dish was tasty nonetheless, the naan was good, not as good as in other places, rice, way too much, and chai  tea, ok, can't compare to Hesteas. Price for everything? Just under $20.00"}
{"text":"The best... period price, quality , service, even take out. I drove from pointe aux tremble because my wife love their mulagamy soup and nowere they made anything close to that good. We tried elswere... many times(sorry) always disapointed will never do again... the only down point the huge lines for rush hour all the way outside..."}
{"text":"This has become a staple for me and my family. First off it's a BYOW!! And the food here is impeccable. Good portions and fast service with the best garlic naan and saag dishes ever. Oh and try the mango lassi if you forgot to get a drink because it's so worth it"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. Tons of flavour and depth to their dishes. The best Indian resto on the block. Plus, it's bring your own beer and wine."}
{"text":"I loved their food so yumm,, the spices were perfect,,, the place was packed ,,, you can bring your own wine or drinks ,,,"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to have lunch here after discovering that our usual spot down the block was closed for the day. We ordered beef biryani and I asked for really mild for my youngest daughter who doesn't tolerate a lot of spiciness, however the dish was spicy even for my high spice standards. The biryani was dry and didn't have much meat in it. 

I ordered the masala dosa and was quite disappointed with my choice. The dosa was thick and I was practically eating dough. My wife and older daughter ordered the tandoori chicken thali and the chicken tikka thali. Those two dishes were good and they both liked it. The naan that came with our meals were good too. 

As far as service was concerned, it took a lot to get the attention of the staff who were more focused on bringing out dishes to the tables or hanging out by the cash register. After several attempts to flag them down,I had to go to the cash register to talk to them. Also, if you are in need to use the washroom, I would avoid at any cost as they are dirty. Hold it until you can use one at a gas station or a coffee shop. 

Bottom line, I wasn't impressed and therefore won't be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious food at very affordable prices. We ate 3 adults and 2 kids for 80$. And we ordered 5 different recipes and rice. Its good that its a BYOW place. The kids dint like the mango lassie, but generally a nice place with delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Not a fancy restaurant and service was dull but overall was worth the trek from the plateau. We had garlic & plain naan (go with garlic!), butter chicken which was good but the meat came cubed and a bit weird and some red chicken dish that came sizzling in its plate (so good). We went with an Indian girl who knew her stuff so she can assert its authenticity! (Sorry I don't remember the names of our dishes)"}
{"text":"Sooooo gooood!! Punjab rice is sooo good. Be careful for spicy food: it IS spicy. Be prepared to wait for a seating, service is fast, but place is crowded: because it's delicious!
Luxurious diner for 4: 78$ tx and tip included! Must go :)"}
{"text":"Parmi les meilleurs restaurants indiens de la ville, toujours plein avec une bonne ambiance, prévoyez un petit temps d'attente qui reste acceptable quand même, les samosas aux légumes restent un must, très très délicieuses, après vous avez un tas de choix, j'ai essayé 3 spécialités, un poulet Tikka Masala qui est très bon, bien sûr le poulet au beurre et mon favori est le vindaloo agneau qui est très très épicé  mais très bon :) 
Le plus intéressant est le prix qui est pas cher du tout pour la quantité et la qualité des plats
Enjoy it !"}
{"text":"how odd!! i came here for lunch, it was my first time and i asked the waiter what he recommends and he pointed out a dish.. i said thank you for the recommendation, ill look at the menu.. next thing you know, he comes back, i have the menu in my hands and im ready to order.. and guess what!! he came back with a plate.. i was very confused as i didnt even order yet.. i told him i never didnt order this.. he said what? (assuming he doesnt speak english or french). I ended up just saying, never mind and took the plate as at the end of the day, its all food.. anyways.. lets say this was by far the weirdest restaurant experience in my book thus far.. food is alright though!"}
{"text":"Delicious samosas and pani puri! The main dishes were decent but the customer service was not great. Ordered matter paneer, chicken kadhai and chicken biryani. Our server never asked us how spicy we wanted our food to be. She couldn't even give us good suggestions. The chicken kadhai and biryani were very spicy. Thankfully, matter paneer was mild. Wouldn't go back unless I am craving their samosas and pani puri. Definitely recommend these two dishes!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken Korma and we served some kind of chicken curry. When we asked the waiter what's wrong he replied that they don't use raisins and almonds in the Korma anymore....because people have allergies. Well they shouldn't order Korma in that case! #bullshit"}
{"text":"Went to Punjab Palace this evening. The waiter brings me an empty plate upon which I find a piece of hair. I return it to him and as I'm handing it over, I see a frickin cockroach hanging out in between the plates he was holding. I yell out \"omg is that a cockroach\" and he looks at it and says \"yes\" like it was nothing. I die. and then I left."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian in the city. I am a regular. There are dishes and spicy and flavorful. I love the Aloo Gobi and the Tarka Dahl is standards. The only dish I'm not crazy about is the butter chicken, not a big fans of the tomato in it. Everything else seller. Service not so much. Lol"}

Le service est cordiale, cependant une serveuse marche comme un éléphant ce qui n'est pas très agréable. Sans doute le plaisir indien"}
{"text":"Place is nice with great ambience. Try grabbing a table near the road for a good view. Option of BYOW/B
We ordered two Thalis one vegetarian and one chicken. Both were very good and authentically Indian in taste. Very nicely cooked vegetable and the bread was served hot (as expected). Quantity is more than sufficient for one person. Overall a very good place to try Indian food. The only thing missing was the dessert which could have completed the Thali in true sense. Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"I know that most people go to an Indian restaurant because they want to eat butter chicken (I'm totally like that too), and the butter chicken here is good, but their lamb saag (cremed spinach) is even better!  I never thought a greenish gooey looking dish could taste that good. Their samosas are also mighty delicious (beware, they're quite spicy!) and were a great teaser to the main dishes. It took them quite awhile to bring out our food - more than 20 mins - when we went there on a Saturday evening (it was full house), but other than that, I have no complaints."}
{"text":"5 $ veggie Tahli was the best . It actually had flavor!  I could taste the coriander in the fresh Dahl!  The naan (gave me an additional serving) was included in the price. The staff was friendly. This is a good place to bring a friend for a first time introduction in not too spicy Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Delicious! We wanted good decent. Priced Indian food, so we drive all the way here. We were not disapointed! Really great food!"}
{"text":"Le thali est pas cher, l'endroit est correct comme la bouffe mais je trouve qui manque un ingrediant .. l'amour .."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de ce restaurant  par des amis. En effet nous avons très bien mangé, le serveur a cependant pris du temps avant de venir nous servir. Ils ne prennent pas de réservation pour moins de 6 personnes alors nous sommes arrivés vers 19hr et avons attendu environ 10 minutes. Les prix sont abordables."}
