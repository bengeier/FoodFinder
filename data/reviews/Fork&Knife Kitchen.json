{"text":"Awesome food and excellent service!!!  Wasn't quite sure how'd I'd like their variety of food since I'm rather particular with my menu (meat & potatoes) and I don't like surprises.  But Basel and team have blown me away with their offering.  Food is always fresh and I'm always eager to unwrap my twice/week deliveries."}
{"text":"Fork& Knife hands down is one of the best meal prep places I've tried so far.  I have only been a customer of theirs for a few weeks.  My favorite dish so far is greek chicken feta quinoa salad!! There's great variety of quality food and the service is great as well.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}

{"text":"First off, Fork and Knife's food is amazing. I get 5 meals delivered to my gym and it saves me time and money and I know I'm getting some tasty/healthy grub.

The real reason I'm writing this is because Basel and his crew really care about their customers. My bank updated my address and I didn't have time to update some recurring payments, one of which was F&K. Basel had emailed me about it but I missed the email. When I saw my card declined I quickly got on and updated it. The next morning I had 5 meals that I wasn't even expecting.

They didn't have to do that, it was totally my fault....but my stomach sure is glad they did.

Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"I work in Catering and Conventions and am a foodie. Fork and Knifes quality food is amazing, I have been recieving the food for about 3 weeks now and I love it! 

Basel is great about communication and I look forward to the meals every day! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a meal service. I have tried a few services in the city and this by far is the best one. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Love love love Fork&Knife.  A crossfitting coworker initially recommended F&K several months ago so I gave it try and have not stopped ordering since. I order meals for lunch for my husband and also some for dinner. If you are busy or want to get in shape and looking for a good meal prep service, this is definitely the one. The food is very tasty, yet healthy. Basel, the owner, is also very accommodating and friendly.  While I'm trying to get better, many times I forget to make my order (timely) and Basel will send a friendly reminder or lets me order late (thank you!!).  F&K is perfect for us because we are busy and don't have time/don't really want to cook.  Thanks Basel. I hope your business continues to thrive!"}
