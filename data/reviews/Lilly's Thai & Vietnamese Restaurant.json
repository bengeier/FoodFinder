{"text":"Called in for pick up, the meat combination pho and summer rolls. Rolls are mostly lettuce and bean sprouts. Hardly any meat in my soup, it's ridiculous. They only offer 3 meats in the combination pho so it could be filled more. I'm not one to complain but I feel ripped off. Portion super small for 9$."}
{"text":"I ate here twice, both times with friends. It's not easy to find if you're not looking for it, which is too bad, because the food is great. Both times, everyone loved everything we ordered.  I can't remember all the dishes we had, but I do remember the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Cucumber Salad, Chicken Satay, Thai Tea, Sticky Rice & Mango and the shrimp and vegetable rolls that are wrapped in a see-through rice thing that is not fried. Also ordered, were a few other Thai dishes (chicken & beef) and some Vietnamese dishes.  The service was good, and the food was fresh, tasty and priced well. The six of us all agreed that Lilly's would be added to our regular dine-out options.   The second time we were there, we were shown an insert to the menu, which is already quite large, offering Steak, Lobster and some other pricey dishes ($25.95 - $29.95). None of us tried anything from the insert."}
{"text":"I wish i could give a \"Negative Star\" to this ridiculous restaurant. THis is a SCAM.   1. Service is bad .    (We stand at the door for 5 mins without a look or smile, he just doing his own thing)   2. Food is not good and unprofessional      (serving Vietnamese food not even have fish sauce, Rice come out is cold...)  3.It is a SCAM. We bought a Groupon 20 minutes before we go, but after dinner they said they do not accept Groupon. They said we have to pay them in full and only thing we can do is just  get a refund from Groupon. But they still posting their ads now at Groupon and the reason they do that just because they want to draw customer to dine in there and get a free ads posted.This is a great SHAME that a restaurant will do that.  I highly recommend that do not go there to eat even is free."}
{"text":"What a surprise when I presented my Groupon for $30.  Manager said we don't accept that coupon anymore.  I just bought it 3 weeks ago.  Too bad for me.  No way to run a business."}
{"text":"The noodle dishes were mostly noodle with very little vegetables or meat. The meat dishes weren't too bad, like chicken basil, except they were very oily. My biggest problem with this restaurant was the overall cleanliness of the place (poor).  It really felt almost dangerous to eat there.  Fortunately, fried or stir-fried food is pretty safe in almost any locale, so none of us got sick or anything. There are many better Thai and Vietnamese places to choose from around Las Vegas, so I don't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Seen an ad at my local gym , 10% off meal with the key . They didn't honor the ad so I had to pay full price. Came here during lunch hour , only a couple tables but took almost 30 minutes for our foods . Foods were mediocre, compared to archis and pan Asian, this place need some works, take it easy on the sugars.  Probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant has been open for only a week when we visited.   I tried the chicken larb and it tasted different than the larb I've had at other Thai restaurants. It was very crunchy, like there was dried onion (or galangal) mixed in with the chicken. I'm not sure if crunchy larb is another version served by some Thai chefs, but it was unexpected. Nonetheless, the larb didn't have much flavor so the crunchiness might have been the only good thing about it.  We tried the Vietnamese rice dishes and pho. These also did not taste remotely like anything they're supposed to. The pho broth was very sweet (not flavorful, just sugary sweet), and the spices were not familiar. These entrees weren't bad, just not very authentic at all. If you want authentic Vietnamese, you'd be better off eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got chicken pad Thai to-go so I could eat something while smoking hookah at Madhouse. All I gotta say it's a super cute place and the pad Thai was good. I think it was made with pho noodles but it's still yummy nonetheless. Mine was a level 7 spicy and the flavors made up for the difference in noodle texture. Would definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This a great meal of yellow curry, Sam rot both with chicken. Great meal with a great price. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great food nice neighborhood atmosphere. Service was good. Nice people. Green curry was sublime.  Yellow was almost as good."}
{"text":"New restaurant, the food was not bad.  There was no one there but our table when we went, I believe that is because they are located in a business district and most customers come in for weekday lunch (we went for dinner).   Our server is nicer and more attentive than most other servers I've had.  Just for the friendly service I would recommend people giving this place a try, plus the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I was surprised that the place was empty at 6 pm. Their food is great, we had pho and pineapple fried rice. Their food is definitely authentic, because it tasted nothing like the pho and fried rice I've had at large popular restaurants in town. And their prices are reasonable. Absolutely recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid four and a half stars, but since I cannot do halves I picked a five star.  It was my boyfriend's birthday, I decided to come here as a surprise.  I left him in the car and explained that I was doing a surprise dinner and the waitress took my order and sat us in a secluded area without a hitch.  +1 Star.  Upon entrance into the dining room the perfume of a sweet curry fills your nose and starts your appetite.  I had ordered two appetizers - pork satay and the summer rolls.  The pork satay was beyond description - buttery and slightly charred - absolutely delicious.  +1 Star.  The summer rolls were crisp and fresh.  The shrimp in the rolls were a beautiful pink colour and perfectly cleaned.  +1 Star.  I had ordered two entrees - crispy duck and the pho dac biet xe lua.  The crispy duck was very good, although the garlic was a little strong and the duck was not crispy.  +1/2 Star.  The pho dac biet xe lia was awesome!  The broth with additions was flavourful and robust.  It contained a generous portion of all the meats and delectable bits of tripe and marrow.  +1 Star.  All in all, I have and will continue to recommend Lilly's to anyone who likes Vietnamese and Thai food.  I myself will continue to be a patron."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai place. They make Kung pao tofu and serve it with brown rice for me! I highly recommend it! Tell them Danny @ Remax sent you!\".........Danny Lambert, resident of Las Vegas since the 60's"}
{"text":"great little place close to home just found our go to Thai place. great flavor, great service."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles with tofu: 4.5 stars Soft shell crab with green curry: 4.5 stars Sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream and strawberries: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 5 stars for a local thai restaurant Menu selection: 5 stars  The menu was so extensive and everything looked so good, that it took us forever to choose. We ended up with the drunken noodles with tofu and soft shell crab with green curry.  My noodles were the perfect amount of spice, though I would have preferred more vegetables. Let me make it clear that a normal person would have been happy with the amount of tofu/vegetables, but I just like more... I am 99.9% sure that if I had told her this, I would have been accommodated (but now I know for next time). The soft shell crab was nice and crispy, with the perfect accompaniment of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. The dessert was a hit for us however, and I'm sure it was hard for my fianc√© to share that block of sweet sticky rice with me. I could eat just a bowl of that rice alone!  What really wowed us was their presentation of the food: it's almost worthy of a casino restaurant. The service was attentive and appreciative of our business. She even asked if we had a coupon! We definitely plan on returning, both to try the lunch specials and to continue exploring their main menu."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY GROUPON, LILLY'S WILL NOT ACCEPT!!!  I don't know why they are offering a deal again.  I was there just last week and they refused to accept my Groupon, as well as 3 other patrons.  We still ate there, but the food is not worth returning.  It's good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love this quiet place. I like the husband's cooking more than the wife's. For dessert, try the fried bananas. They have good wifi too. If you want peace and quiet with good food, come here."}
{"text":"Our family 10 peoples come to this restaurant on 28 dec , before we came we called made reservation , a men worked at front deck set up table for us very nice . Food excellent , service the best , cook fast ."}
{"text":"Food was very good, we tried the papaya salad, seafood tom yum and pad thai. Service on the other hand was lacking, kids too busy on Facebook to give us service. Had to shake our empty glasses of water for a bit till they got the hint. Waited ten min watching them play on computer before going up and asking for our check so we could leave."}
{"text":"i love Thai food and always search for a good place. this place is it. the food is decently priced like any other restaurant maybe even a few bucks cheaper. anyway the quality of the food is great and the quantity is also great they really give you a lot. very quiet, chill, environment. for sure coming back. Thai tea and coffee here are also great."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and the place was empty the whole time.  We were the only customers and it was prime lunch time.  They have a pretty good size restaurant.  The noodle bowl was pretty good, but another item we ordered was pork and rice.  There were just five small pieces of pork in a big plate of rice.  I've ordered this dish at other Vietnamese restaurants and had like ten times more pork (sometimes proportionately more than I have rice!).  The service was ok, but it seems there was only the cook and one server, who ran out a couple of times for deliveries."}
{"text":"The food at this place is not worth your money. They have small portions and the flavor is gross."}
{"text":"Great food! Got pad see ew and the portion was so generous. Friends got panang curry and tom yum soup and loved the powerful flavor of their dishes. Would come again."}
{"text":"Very good mom and pop place w/fresh ingredients and good dishes. My favorite comfort food is beef pho and they execute it pretty well. Haven't tried any other dishes yet but probably will soon."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated, but no music playing. I ordered a house special pho (pho dac biet), I assumed since it's mainly a Thai restaurant, it'll be sweet; which it was. If you want chop sticks, ask for them. Great service.     Overall, I'd come back again."}
{"text":"The pad see was very good, had good flavor as for spicy I went with a two because he said they were true to the number, very good advice. I liked the spring roll it too had good flavor to it. Next time I will try the curry and fried rice, I love they use \"NO MSG\" and have it posted. I went at 2:40 so I got the lunch special portion  it was plenty enough and had left overs. I do recommend you give it a try it's very affordable and you can go during the lunch time specials, or spend a couple extra dollars and get the full portion and have the full menu option. Great customer service, very friendly, clean establishment."}
{"text":"This review is a comparison of the pho I had from the other two nearby places. Had the pho hai san. First off, you get a lot for what you pay for. The basil wasn't as fresh as I've had but I will write it off as an off day and will report next time on this when I go back. The variety of pho is the most out of the three restaurants except for maybe the other place where you can custom make your pho. The broth was mild in flavor but I wonder if it's because I got the seafood instead of a meat selection. My pho did come with thinly sliced onions which added to the flavor. The dining area is small but clean and is my second favorite regarding decor.   I would definitely come back because this place has the best bang for the buck."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the mood for some Vietnamese food and this place was near by. We each order Pho soup and the meat looked questionable. I didn't eat my meat but my brother did and he was sick a few hours later. I wouldn't eat here again but I will say the summer rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent, particularly their noodle based dishes. Food is usually ready very promptly. Guy behind the counter is always courteous, friendly, and ready to assist."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to eat on Thanksgiving and happened upon this place. What a gem!  The food was delicious; the staff was friendly: the portions are large, and the prices are reasonable.  We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best pad Thai and coconut curry and pot stickers I have had in Las Vegas and I have been to A lot of places here"}
{"text":"My daughter and I wanted to try someplace new and stopped into Lilly's tonight. We shared the Summer rolls with Tofu, Potstickers, Chicken Pad Thai and Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio which was grilled pork and Vietnamese Egg rolls over vermicelli and fresh veggies. It was all delicious and extremely fresh, especially the veggies. Little things stood out like how awesome the sauce for the Potstickers was.   The atmosphere is clean but basic, it's all about the food and the service. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and took the time to answer all of our questions.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there on accident. But it was a great restaurant. Got the spice level right, good portion. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Good food good prices great portion sizes.  I don't have much more to say, yelp got mad at me for filling in the rest of my review with II's. So here it is, good food, good service, good portion size, good value."}
{"text":"Delicious, flavourful and really spicy Curry! Service us quick and great. Will return."}
{"text":"Yelp continues to disappoint in Vegas. I tried the Thai Fried Rice and Pho Chin Nam. The pho was skimpy on the meat, but it tasted OK but not great. The rice wasn't actually Thai Fried Rice and was rather bland. I always order Thai Fried Rice at Thai restaurants because this style is my favorite. So when the dish came out with no tomatoes, it was a surprise, especially since the menu describes it with tomatoes (as is standard). Instead, it contains carrots, corn, and green beans. WTF is this? When I asked why the difference from what the menu describes, I was told that they removed the tomatoes \"a long time ago\" because customers didn't like it \"so fishy\" ... uh, what? When have tomatoes ever been fishy? And green beans? Corn? This is definitely not Thai Fried Rice, and relying on Yelp in Vegas continues to make me shake my head."}
{"text":"This went down the toilet, there food is getting smaller and the quality has definitely decreased since i have been here. I dont know why yelp takes my posts off but i hope people will read the ratings of 1 star because they are telling the truth. If you want to go try it, be my guest but you will regret it. They use to have an awesome waitress but she left to go back home. Now they have people that dont speak english."}
{"text":"So great food! I love the price! Fast delivery service and friendly staff! If you craving some thai food i truly recommend here"}
{"text":"Food is great and staff is very friendly! I got pad Thai with chicken and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to others and will be going back myself!"}
{"text":"I had tried a few Thai places in my hood and they were all pretty much forgettable, so I kind of gave up on it for almost a year. I live less than 5 minutes from Lilly's and decided to give it a shot when a random jones for Pho Ga hit one night. I've eaten at some A-list Vietnamese places in San Fran and the East Bay area when I go to visit family there, places so legit you won't hear a word of English when you go there. Lilly's wasn't far off the mark - delish white meat chicken with bean sprouts and noodles, not too salty. The pot stickers and spring rolls were good, but the summer rolls were a level up on the intensity. Massive portion, hint of cilantro, perfect with peanut sauce. The bun ga nuong cha gio was excellent, something new for me, tasty and unique. Large thai ice tea that was better than most, the thai spice was spot on, sweet but not over the top like some can be. It was pretty quiet when I stopped by later at night, there was only one person eating in. The kid at the counter was friendly and we chatted for a minute. I'm looking forward to trying the Thai food to see if it measures up also. Very solid as far as Vegas goes, I will definitely be keeping this place in my back pocket. It was tough to find for a second as there are a couple rows of strip malls packed in behind Vons and the new Anytime Fitness that just opened. Lilly's is 2 doors down from Madhouse Coffee on one side and next to a dry cleaner's on the other. Definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. I love Thai food and decided to give this place a chance. Curry chicken is on point, so are the fried calamari, fried rice and shrimp. Love it."}
{"text":"such good food. never had spicy pad thai that was still so flavorful. had no idea how i've missed this place when ever i'm around that area. it's a must go."}
{"text":"Always great food. Pho ve don is my favorite. Nice delivery guy Its been a rough week and good food heals the soul!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place long time cause I used to go mad house coffee but I haven't try this place yet. So I decided to try lily's thai for today. And I love this place!! I ordered pad thai and my spicy level was 10 of 10.  This place's pad thai is one of the bestest pad thai that  I ever had. I will definitely coming back! Thank you for serving delicious foods!"}
{"text":"We ordered the tofu pad Thai and the combo pho and they were both delicious!!  The tofu was cooked perfectly and the pad Thai had perfect texture and taste. The pho soup had great flavor with the basil and jalape√±os. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once so my review is more on the customer service than it is on the food. I ordered a Thai salad #3 spicy out of 10. I get that these run a little spicier so I try to get a low number. When I got my food it was burning my lips it was so hot! It was literally a 10 out of 10. I took it back to let the guy know that I ordered a 3 and it was really hot. He rolled his eyes and he said he will tell them to remake it. So I came back in 10 minutes and I swear to you it was still as spicy and I don't feel like it was changed at all. I did not take it back at that point because I didn't want to deal with the guy at the front."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for some Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. We had the pad thai and curry and we were both pleasantly surprised by the food here. The food is good and the service is fantastic. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"FYI... I did a delivery order.   I ordered:  Pho Tai: broth was okay but wtf happened to the noodles? When I poured the soup into the noodles they didn't separate. So I started to stir it around and then the noodles starting breaking and it became blocks of noodles.   Tom yum: I asked for it to be hot and I swear it was less than mild. It wasn't even sour so it tasted like watered down tom yum. Plus I thought it was weird they used cherry tomatoes.  Spring rolls: $6 for two spring rolls and you're only going to put one shrimp split in half in each spring roll? Then stuff the rest with lettuce and noodles? I feel like they just robbed my money after I ate that.   Thai tea: was just thai tea. Really sweet.   Total was $28 plus tip."}
{"text":"This was the worst Thai Food that I have ever had in my life.  My boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew and it was full of tiny pieces of broken, overcooked noodles, (seriously....the longest noodle that we could find was about an inch long) TONS of grease, a few dried up pieces of chicken and what seemed like an entire bulb of raw garlic, roughly chopped into huge chunks.  To add insult to injury, it was served lukewarm, which is a miracle in itself, seeing as how we were the only people in the restaurant and we sat there and watched the cook hand the food to the server. I ordered the Pad Prik King, my favorite dish, but what I received was definitely NOT Pad Prik King! Pad Prik King is an extremely flavorful and pungent dish that contains green beans, meat, fish sauce, basil, red curry paste and kaffir lime leaves. The sauce is always bright orange in color. NONE of these things were in the meal that they served me....not even the green beans! I asked the server to make sure that this was, indeed, Pad Prik King, and she said that it was. But what was in front of me was a plate of mixed vegetables with greyish colored rubbery mystery meat served in a flavorless brown gravy---like the kind you would buy in a jar to put on mashed potatoes--- filled with huge chunks of the aforementioned rough chopped raw garlic. No fish sauce, no kaffir lime leaves, no fresh basil....nothing but meat and veggies in a brown, garlicky paste.  And mine, too, was served lukewarm.  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service, veggie ph√≤, and Thai spring rolls were outstanding!  We'll definitely be back in the near future.  Bonus:  we also receive 7% Yelp Cash."}
{"text":"We came here twice for dinner during our weeklong trip to Vegas over Thanksgiving.  Both times we were the only table.  Kind of weird at first but after you realize you have the undivided attention of Tippy the waitress and the food is fresh and well-made, it's not that big of a deal that you're the only ones in the restaurant.  This place recently opened in Sept so it's still new to the locals.  I'm not a local but I found them through restaurant.com.  Used my certificate the first night but the second night, got a 15% discount.  First, thai tea is not $3.95, but $2.95.  Still expensive but it's really concentrated and in a big glass that you can actually mix w/ water and get at least 2 glasses out of it.  We like ours not too sweet so we were able share it w/ 3 ppl.   Here's a list of some of our favorites: -Pho (the first one, can't remember name but this was delicious.) -Fried Snapper with Basil sauce (fish was fresh) -Panang curry with beef -Fried Banana with Mango Ice Cream (YUM)  This place is situated across a Mercedes-Benz car lot on Sahara.  It isn't the most ideal location, so I hope they do more advertising to get more patrons.  I wish them the best and will definitely return in the near future when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm so glad there is a decent Pho restaurant that isn't on Spring Mountain! Their Pho is excellent and same with their Summer Rolls. Everything was very fresh. The waitress was very attentive which is a plus. I will come back next time to try their Thai food."}
{"text":"So always notice Lilly since next to one of my regular coffee spots. Always looking try new places plus was in the mood for Thai lunch special action.   I ended up getting the Panang Curry with Chicken. Any Panang Curry would say fan of with Thai food. It always going be losing battle when think about lotus of siam the ultimate Panang Curry sauce. Lilly is pretty solid in my opinion. It had a nice depth in flavor, love love the color, and compliments the chicken and vegetables perfectly. Chicken and Vegetables was cooked on point. The only thing would complain is wish got bigger portion. Truth is lunch special so expect smaller portion. The lunch specials one thing that really stood out compare other Thai restaurants diversity. It takes up whole page on the menu not just couple items but literally filled it out. You got choose from noodle dishes, curries, and regular dishes. The price is steal of deal most of them is under $8. It comes with your standard egg roll and rice (you can do brown rice besides white rice).   The service was fabulous. I was the only one in the restaurant and went when it first opened. The gentlemen was great. It was my first time explained the menu, friendly, and just great service!!!  Lilly will be spot come back try more of the menu..."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for Pho. We always dine in. Its small, but always clean and quiet. The staff is so kind and attentive.  We usually start with the chicken pot stickers, which remind me a lot of dumplings. There is so much goddess packed in that little bite.  Their pho is always proper. Flavorful broth and good sized portion for $6-8. And their thai iced teas are delish.   Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Seems like a great place to get a quick and cheap lunch, (they have specials) and we order to-go from here. It's family run, with the whole lot helping out, kids included. If you're a fan of spicy food (I am) I'd recommend the Thai Beef Salad. Curries were good too.  I'd recommend getting food to go, there isn't much of an atmosphere to speak of, but good inexpensive food."}
{"text":"Solid little Vietnamese place. I stopped here for a quick bite to eat on my way home and needed something to go as I had a meeting to attend. As soon as I walked in, a woman quickly greeted me and I asked if they had any banh mi's. She said, yes, pork, which is exactly what I was craving. Perfect. She said she'd have it right out to go for me and they did. Seriously don't think it took 5 minutes. Got home, unwrapped my sandwich and chowed down. The bread was clearly fresh and had the perfect light crunch on the outside and soft middle like a truly fresh French bread should! The meat was flavorful and texture was perfectly soft. I love love love that they didn't skimp on the cilantro and carrots. Austin, TX needs to step up their banh mi game. Take note!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place today. The server was really helpful helping me decide on my plate . The food was amazing . It's a perfect mom and pops restaurant . You can taste the original recipes , I can't remember the name of the plate but the pork had so much flavor it was crazy . Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lily's at this location. I used to go often when it was in Sahara several years ago, but never since the move. We enjoyed our lunch. The nam sod was light and tasty and I enjoyed that it was served on lettuce instead of on rice. The egg rolls were ok, nothing special, but they came with a very tasty sauce that I'd like to try on something else. My wife had pad Thai and she said it was good. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I would probably have given a better rating but when I went in the person who took my to go order wasn't very nice...I don't remember his name I came in around 8:45 at night but I still expected him to be somewhat nice... I ordered the pho tai and spring rolls and since I just moved back to Vegas I lost my Asian pho soup spoon and asked if I could get one..the guy said no!! I said I'll pay for it I don't mind! He said no!! We don't sell and walked away from me! NEVER in all my times of eating Pho from Nevada to Florida did ANY restaurant not at least sell it to me! He told me I could use the little plastic spoon that come in the bag...smh needless to say this is the last time I will order from here"}
{"text":"Ever have 1 great experience and then feel totally ripped off by the 2nd? We apparently got lucky w/ our 1st visit to Lilly's. Food was good & fresh, service was aight. 2nd visit: $15 Wonton soup that was just broth, a couple wontons, cabbage and an odd amount of pre-ground black pepper was the 1st foul. Mixed Seafood Pad Thai featuring old, stanky mussels was the 2nd. The sauce was broken, the noodles that awful texture you get from grocer's pantry just-add-water pad Thai. We sent it back to receive a 10% discount. They served us ratchet food & expected us to pay $4.50/bite of it! We serve for a living, and it takes an awful lot to get us to tip sub-20%, but we left 10% and awkwardly shrugged this sad little joint off. It feels good to support a struggling small business, but it feels extra-shitty to have it repay its guests by daring them to argue over the tab on their F-ups. So that's why Lilly's is always empty. If you like looking for hidden SE Asian gems stick to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Lilly's Thai & Vietnamese is a nice little Thai restaurant tucked away in a small shopping center.  The atmosphere is nice and laid back with plenty of space.  They serve wine and beer.    Overall my experience here was pleasant, mostly due to our server.  However, I have mixed feelings about the Thai food here.  Let's get started.  A friend and I ordered the Sam Rot with chicken ($9.95), the red duck curry ($16.95), and the Lilly's chicken wings appetizer ($6.95).  I have had Sam Rot before, so my opinion probably isn't well educated here, but it seemed like a sweet dish.  It was lightly fried and served with a sweet slightly sour and savory sauce.  It was well prepared, no grease, and had a nice light (although sweet) flavor.  Interesting, but not overly impressive.  The Lilly's chicken wings were well done as well, but again lightly sweet.  The style seemed slightly Chinese.  They were good though so no complaints.  The duck curry is where I had a little disappointment.  The serving at first seemed large enough, but upon further examination there was very little duck for the price.  A well known Thai restaurant nearby has three times the amount of duck for nearly the same price.  The duck itself was tender and not gristly.  It was well prepared.  The curry was very light on this dish, and used more like a sauce.  It had a good flavor but was a little bit too sweet.  The cooked veggies were good but nothing to rave about.    Overall this is a decent Thai restaurant.  Would I return?  Well the menu is large, but the food seems a little too sweet for my Thai tastes.  I would like to explore some of the other menu items though."}
{"text":"The food is good quality and tastes great. The service is quick and friendly. The tap water tastes good. The atmosphere is comfortable and quiet. I got pad Thai with chicken at level 4/10 spice. It was delicious. The flavor were distributed evenly amongst the dish giving it a consistently good taste. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Thank you for all the support but we are no longer at this location. Our current location is 8470 W Desert Inn Rd Suite H-3 lilly's Thai and Vietnamese Cafe. Hope to see you there"}
{"text":"We had the Lilly's house noodle and spicy seafood clay pot. Both dishes were delicious and priced very reasonably. I'd have to return to see how their pad Thai tastes, but I think this is my new go-to Thai restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here with family last night, the food is good and the service is very friendly and accommodating.  We ordered:  - Pad Thai - noodles were a little over cooked, mushy - Yellow Curry - good, order spicy! - Nam Tok (Thai beef salad) - awesome, order spicy! - Papaya Salad - yummy, order spicy! - Chicken w/ Mixed Veggies - good We previously had: - Crispy Duck - good, expected breast slices, but it's sliced like roasted duck - Red Curry Catfish - good spicy  The highlights were definitely was the salads, fresh and flavorful.  We'll be back again.  Plus it's the closest Asian food you can find coming from the West side, until you hit further East."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Pho and I'm soo glad I did.  I had the chicken pho and it was amazing.  Whatever spices are in that and green peppers give it that heat that sneaks up on you.  The chicken larb is amazing with fresh cilantro and mint - just love it.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Loving this place. Came here with a huge cravings for curry. Luckily, it was just across the parking lot from where I was. I ordered their Panang Curry with chicken & tofu. It came just at the right amount of time. The ingredients was fresh & the curry was so delicious with the spice level #4. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp pad Thai. It was good enough. Nothing to shout about. The shrimp were perfectly cook just not a lot of flavor. Also had the spring rolls. They were really good. Friendly service when I came to pick up my order. I will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great new location & they have take-away! It's a generous portion for the price of a small on the Pho."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday! So that means I'm craving Thai food. Thai food Tuesdays lol. Anyways, I came here for some pork pad see ew because my other go to places were either closed or on vacation. So this place was my third choice. I ordered pad see ew and an iced Thai coffee. The pork pad see ew was pretty good. It had nice flavor and a good kick. I ordered it level 3 spicy. The only thing that I didn't like was their iced Thai coffee. It was just mainly sweet and I didn't really taste much of a coffee flavor. I'd come again if my other go to Thai places are closed."}
{"text":"Thai and Vietnamese offerings?  Upon looking at the menu, I was instantly impressed.  What we ordered: Lychee Drink - Yummy.. actual pieces of Lychee.  Mmmm. Thai Coffee-  Very good here.  I recommend it. Vietnamese Spring Rolls- Nothing fancy here Calamari- Very good, it tasted very fresh. Beef Panang Curry-  We always order this when we do Thai.  We were not impressed. Chicken Pad Thai-  Pretty good.  We nearly finished it. Deep Fried Banana w/ Coconut Ice Cream-  Had strawberries in it.  I liked it, but I don't think I'd order it again...  It was really good, just very sweet!  Pros:   * There is an extensive menu that is separated Thai & Vietnamese ( I liked the layout)   *  Lunch specials available.  Decently priced.    *  Lychee Drink.  Yes this is a plus!  I love Lychee!!   *  Good sized portions   * Attentive server.     *  I loved the Thai Coffee here.   Cons:   *  I noticed there were spring rolls on the Vietnamese menu, but the server pointed out the spring rolls on the Thai side of the menu.  He insisted I order that instead... if I'm not mistaken, it was a dollar more?  I just found that a bit confusing.  *  The beverages were a bit over-priced.  Nearly $3 each for Thai Coffee and Lychee.  * Panang Curry.  We were not impressed.  In Lilly's defense, the veggie cuts in the Panang Curry were larger than usual and did have a more fresh taste.  It's just that it was not as flavorful when in comparison to other places where we had this dish.  Tips:   *  Make sure to eat your Calamari while its still hot.  It doesn't taste as great after it gets to room temperature (I've never had this problem when ordering Calamari elsewhere).  Also if you want a lemon wedge with your Calamari, you'll have to ask for it.   *  The dessert was big enough for 2 to share.     *  I know some Thai restaurants use a 1-10 scale for level of heat, but at Lilly's they just ask if like it mild, medium, or hot.  Just a heads up.    Overall,  I plan on coming back.  I liked nearly everything we ordered and I'm anxious to try out the rest of the restaurant's offerings (maybe next time, I'll focus more on the Vietnamese side of the menu).  A place where you can order both Pho and Pad Thai... I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice little find :-) The food is really good, fresh and wonderful flavor. I had the Pho which I'm kinda picky about and it was great! The flavor was really good, noodles was done perfect too. You have to save room for the Mango sticky sweet rice! I don't even like mango's so I just skipped eating the mango's and just enjoyed the sweet sticky rice :-) prices are good, food is great and they were very helpful with my little toddler ;-) I love eating at place where the workers are so sweet and nice. I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with Don, armed with a Restaurant.Com certificate. When we walked in, we were pretty much given a warm welcome by everyone and seated at a nice table by the window. The waiter gave us both the regular menu and the lunch special menu and asked us if we had any coupons. We debated on whether we were going to get lunch specials or use the certificate, but since they already took it we figured we might as well. The menu had a VERY large selection with one side being Thai and the other being Vietnamese. Since we originally came here for Thai food, we decided to stick with our plan. We ordered Calamari, Beef Pad Thai, Chicken Panang, Lychee drink, Thai Coffee, and the Fried banana with ice cream dessert.   The drinks came first and we were both in love. The Thai Coffee I got was was light and tasty. Sometimes i get Thai Coffee or Tea and it's just waay too sweet or concentrated. This one was made perfectly. The Lychee drink, however, was the star of the whole meal. It was SOO delicious! It tasted just like the Lychee Jelly cups I used to eat when I was a kid. Don really had to try hard not to drink it all at once.   They brought out the Calamari first. It didn't really strike me as calamari at first sight/taste. It was extremely crunchy and fried, but I really enjoy crunchy food. I actually tasted the batter a lot more than the Calamari itself. It was served with a little cucumber/peanut salad and sweet/sour sauce. We left a few pieces and ended up eating them during our meal, but by then they were kind of cold and a little soggy and the flavor just wasn't good, so I suggest you don't let it sit for a while. The Panang Curry wasn't as flavorful as what I'm used to; it had a more subtle taste, but it was okay. The Pad Thai was very good though. The noodles and meat were both perfectly cooked.   After eating our entrees, we decided to try their Fried Banana and Ice Cream (coconut). The presentation was very nice (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wWrB4eU6MmK4J9I_8vzOPQ/l.jpg). The banana pieces were so small, especially since they were all surrounded in wrapping, but they still went very well with the coconut ice cream, which was very fresh (not icy at all).   Overall, we definitely plan on coming back here. Next time, we'll be trying items from their Vietnamese menu!  Tips: -You MUST try their Lychee drink!! -Get a Restaurant.Com certificate for more savings -If you order Calamari, don't let it sit for more than 5 minutes -Lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The service at Lilly's is really good.  Tippy was our waitress, and she really does try her best.  However, the food was just a-ok.  Nothing special or worth remembering from this place.  I've been to many Thai restaurants in Vegas, and Lilly's would probably rank as one of the lowest in terms of how good the food is.  Pin Kaow, Archis and Komol are far by superior - by a long shot.    The panang was so-so, and the pad see ew was ok at best.  They didn't ask what level of heat you preferred on any of their dishes which is strange for a thai restaurant.  We ordered the Lilly's appetizer sampler, and it was $14.95 for 3 pieces of calamari (teeny tiny pieces), two whole egg rolls cut in half, two pieces of fried shrimp and 3 little dumplings about the size of a quarter.    The amount of food and the quality of the food you get compared to what you're spending is not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is small was really clean. The service was amazing and the server was quick to order. We ordered summer rolls with shrimp and it is freshly made.  The Pho noodle soup was amazing and the Thai curry was perfect! Its only one mile from our home so we are definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time eating from here and I ordered delivery that should've taken an hour and they were here in 30 minutes. I ordered the Panang Scallops, Thai Salad and Pork Satay (yes, just for me, although the leftovers my husband will eat) and I am pleasantly surprised! I am always willing to try new Thai restaurants in town and this one is near the top. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had to try it once, but won't go back again!  Stopped in on a Friday afternoon for a quick lunch midday.  There was another table seated before us, and several other patrons came in after us.  Our orders were simple, Iced Tea, Soda, Tom Ka Soup for both, and chicken & broccoli for both (luncheon menu)  The soda was canned (not the end of the world, but a great indication that you wont get free refills), the iced tea was good.  We were promptly served our spring rolls also quite good, hot and fresh.   The soup came out, piping hot and quite tasty.  There was a certain 'funk' about the mushrooms that we couldn't pinpoint, but it was good, nonetheless.  Then came the entree.  A very simply chicken & broccoli (which, after a quick glance around appeared to be ordered by multiple people).    I could smell the odor of (raw) fish steaming from my dish.  I took a couple of bites and was completely overthrown  by the stench and overpowering taste of fish (my guess is it was from the fish sauce).  The wait staff didn't speak enough English to try to send it back or negotiate another dish.  We didn't eat any of it, settled the check and had to leave we were so disgusted by the smell and taste.    Sadly, we wont be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. I always order the chicken pad Thai (lunch or dinner portion) and both are big enough to fill me for two meals. My boyfriend always gets the beef pho and he says it's amazing, I've only ever tried the broth which is great. Not that I don't want to fully the the pho, it's just I like to save my appetite for the delicious chicken pad Thai. I usually order it at a 5 and boy is it spicy! And I am a spicy food fanatic, so if you're not be aware haha. The food is always fresh and the people who work there are sweet. You can tell it's a mom and pop place and that's why I love it. Prices are reasonable. I'll definitely go back :) (also, try their Thai milk tea it's delicious!)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is kinda hidden. I only knew about it through Groupon. Lighting was a bit dark and there's no lights in the back by the restroom! Also, I'm not sure if its normally this way, but their AC was probably broken. It felt like we were eating in a sauna. There was only one guy working and he sat us down and didn't come back until 15-20 minutes later to take our order.   We ordered Vietnamese eggrolls which were pretty good. However, their Thai dishes were horrible. We ordered Phad Thai and it had no taste as well as the Garlic Chicken and Yellow Curry. I would probably give this restaurant another try with Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for lunch today. Unfortunately we missed the lunch special but the food was delicious. The chicken sate was the best I've ever had. I ordered the shrimp stir fry and he got the pad thai. Both were very flavorful.  We can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I just got delivery from here and it's fantastic. Great prices and good quality food. Definitely one of my new favorite places to order from plus the delivery guy was really nice. Only downside is the delivery took about an hour which is typical. I ordered fried calamari. Most other places I get fried calamari, it comes squishy and gooey. Not Lillies! The calamari was super light and fluffy with a nice crunch. Also the size of the pieces were pretty big and the sauce that came with it was amazing. I also got the green chicken curry and got it spicy medium. The flavor was great and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. Also the chicken was amazing and juicy.  My friend got the combination pho. It was kinda mediocre. The flavor of the broth was there but the consistency was thin and it was really oily. The noodles were already kinda hard which is an easy fix but still we had just got it so it should've been like that yet. Also the meat didn't look super fresh and one piece of the flank was a little green. The pho was still good though regardless.  Overall this place was really great and would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I work around the corner, Why did I not find this place sooner!!! My Go To place for pad thai, drunken noodles or pho!! Love it! Food is great, price is reasonable and staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"This won't be long. The food and service was great. Nice atmosphere and it's a great value."}
{"text":"The service was attentive and great. The food wasn't at all what I imagined. The food all had a Tom Yum flavoring base which was kinda odd and it made the food fishy smelling and tasting which was awful. Myself, I ordered Drunken Noodle.. I've tried a bunch of drunken noodles before and this was waaaay different. First off the noodle was super overcooked so it was mushy and broken. Typical drunken noodles are somewhat solid not broken into a bunch of pieces looking like baby food. The shrimp fried rice had such a fishy taste to it and it was really greasy. I love Thai food so I've eaten at majority of the places by me, but this experience wasn't something I'd like to come back nor recommend. The only good thing from this place was the pa nang curry which tasted and looked exactly like a yellow coconut curry lol."}
{"text":"We just went here last night.  At first we were a little nervous because we were literally the only people in the restaurant, but the waitress was really friendly.  The menu was pretty ambitious--they have Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese.  We had a Restaurant.com coupon, so we had to spend at least $35.  Because the Chinese and Vietnamese was a bit cheaper, we ended up getting Thai dishes, along with an appetizer, dessert, and two Thai iced teas.  The prices were fair and portions were big.  The only thing that seemed a little off was the price of the Thai teas, which were $3.95 each!  That's definitely high, and the drinks weren't big or anything.   But everything else was really good.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I tried their pad thai as soon as they open. I usually like eat spicy number 8 to 10.  It was not spicy at all and taste nothing.  The staff is not really friendly.  Online orderin system was good."}
{"text":"I ordered a to go pho combination, the container of the soup is broken. And they said that the combination is a lot, is only 5 pieces of meat and no tendons... no good!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here, ordered the calamari salad and tea.  The calamari was really good.  The salad veggies tasted fresh.  And I really liked the nuts in it, it gave it a nice crunchy mix.  The dressing was very good, but I thought there was a little too much of it on the salad.    It left a bit of an aftertaste.   I did like the fact that I could hear in the kitchen as they were making the salad, hearing everything being chopped up and mixed - fresh and homemade.    For some reason, I didn't care for the tea.  Perhaps it wasn't hot enough.  The service I thought was OK, not great, but not bad either.   Functional, but lacking the \"warm and friendly\" factor I think is so important for these types of places.    Also I think the physical presentation factor of the place could be improved.  It looks \"hit-or-miss\" from the outside, and if it weren't for the good yelp reviews, I doubt I would have given it a shot.  Inside, I think there are probably small things they can do to help increase the atmosphere factor.  Right now it lacks something.  That said, I think this place has potential.  With a little more attention to detail, it has 4 or 5 star potential."}
{"text":"Very disappointing :( I really wanted to love this place being that it's so near to us. The service was great, there was one waiter who was friendly & attentive. Food was poor quality.   Appetizers: Spring roll- I'm not a huge fan of spring rolls to begin with but my bf ordered. I thought the wrap was too thick, I'm big on texture and it felt weird. Wontons were probably the best dish, fried Foods can never go wrong.   Main course: we both got pho, I had the well done brisket & steak pho which came with about 3 pieces of meat. I ordered more meat on the side which was a $2 up-charge.  Dessert: mango sticky rice is one of my fav desserts, sticky rice was good not the best quality and mangos were about to go bad, very mushy & flavor was almost tart.  Overall, I thought the place was well kept but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  I wish I could remember the name of the dish I got (my husband ordered for me while I was out on a business call), but whatever it was, it was delicious.  It tasted very close to Massaman Curry, though I know it was not.  Also, my husband's pho was delicious.  Very herby and aromatic. Not flat at all, like most pho we've had.    The waiter seemed to be very invested in the food, so I think he may have been the owner or manager.  He asked us how he could improve the dishes, even though they were already delicious.  I told him I would have to try something *better* before I could critique it.  He was very friendly, very attentive, and it was a wonderful experience.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great food great service! it's a very small cute place with great portions of food as well. my friends and i got the drunken noodles, yellow curry, and pad thai noodles with calamari as an appetizer. all super good! definitely gonna be a regular stop for us now since it's right next to our fav coffee place :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try this restaurant after driving by several times and reading some Yelp reviews.  I also had a Groupon I wanted to use.  We ordered Chinese style egg rolls.  They were quite good, served very hot such that we had to let them sit for quite awhile to prevent mouth burn.  For main courses, my wife ordered their garlic stir fry with chicken.  It was just the way she likes it, lots of garlic and a good amount of chicken with some vegetables.  I ordered the soft shell crab in garlic curry sauce.  They didn't ask me about a spiciness level and I didn't specify one.  It was a mild curry, but it was very good.  The crab was on top of asparagus and some yellow squash and zucchini.  The presentation of both dishes was very good.  For dessert, I tried the custard-Thai style.  It's more like a piece of bread pudding.  It was very flavorful and quite enjoyable.  My wife got some green tea ice cream.  We enjoyed our meal a lot!  The place is small--the sign says Maximum Occupancy 49.  Our server was very efficient.  There was a small language barrier but we overcame that with numbers and by pointing.  After the meal, he asked two things--how was the food?  Did we think it was priced fairly?  It's as if they are trying to find pricing that gets business but doesn't break their bank.  I did find the question quite odd.  We will be back.  I have to try some of the Vietnamese dishes.  And when my wife asks, \"Are you going to write about this restaurant on the computer?\" (Is the pope Catholic?), you know she enjoyed her meal a lot!"}
{"text":"Several years ago, I stopped at Lilly's to get take out but in those days they closed between lunch and dinner.  Having dropped a friend off at home, this was a nearby choice to get some Thai food--something I've been neglecting recently.  The restaurant is a small space in a strip mall in the Von's plaza on DI.  I was told I could sit wherever I wanted, and I was brought water and the Thai iced coffee I ordered for this hot day.  Looking over the menu, I stopped when I came to the duck selections.  It was simply a matter of choosing which one.  I opted for the Ka pao duck which is boneless, roasted duck topped with a spicy basil sauce.  I was asked how spicy I wanted my dish.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I chose 7.  The server questioned whether I liked spicy foods and told me that they use fresh Thai spices.  I stuck with the 7.  After a reasonable amount of time, my dinner was brought and it smelled really good.  That matched the way it tasted too.  I would get a spice level of 8 another time but the 7 was good.  I was asked if I wanted chopsticks or silverware.  I opted for silverware because I don't eat Thai food with chopsticks.  Service was good.  I need to return to try some Vietnamese food they have and see how it stacks up against other Vietnamese palces.  There are also a number of duck dishes to get too."}
{"text":"The pho soup base is really good, no MSG, tastes fresh. The panang curry pork lunch special was not bad too, wished more rice comes with it but the pork was not as soft as expected. Definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It's 10x better then SideStreet Pho across the same Von's parking lot.  That place should stay as the name states \"on the street side\".  Lilly's is more authentic.  No reason for China mainlanders making Pho. Lilly's is the place togo!!"}
{"text":"This place is great had the combo pho won't even try to write it great flavors nice amount of meat but not much tendon which is my favorite part. Also had some calamari and fried perfection is what they gave me.  Also had a little bit of a spicy pickled cucumber with that was great.  I'm going back sometime soon and getting one of their daily specials they had about 7 listed on a Monday so I'm interested in what they will have on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great workers.  From the first time you get in there they greet you with open arms like your family. They always made sure everything was ok with my meal and even ask if there is anything that needs to be changed.  What restaurant would ask you that?!?!  After my meal even the chef came out to see if everything was ok. I really appreciate that from all of the staff.  A great experience and would really recommend this place to anyone.  A must try!!!"}
{"text":"I came in in the middle of a weekday right after a doctor's appointment so it was not busy at all... I mean there was no one there. No biggie.   Since i was the only one there the service was wonderful. The female sever was really attentive and checked on me from time to time.   Being a Thai and Vietnamese restaurant, I wanted to try something from each cuisine. The food was just ok, oohing that I would come back for. I think it's great that they have two cuisines but they need to concentrate on one and get that right instead."}
{"text":"He says.. We came here with high expectations after reading some of the reviews here. Ordered the Tom Kai gai, viet spring rolls, the pad Thai, pho bo, and panang curry chicken between the 2 of us. After tasting them all, I've concluded that this is the worst Thai/Viet restaurant I have yet to try in the entire Las Vegas area. The pho was absolutely tasteless, almost like water and noodles, and even with some hoisin sauce it just tasted like water with noodles with hoisin sauce. The curry looked like it came out of a fast food place, the carrots and chicken were so horribly cut they look like they were made by a 5 year old, and the sauce was way too salty. The Tom Kai gai was too creamy, it was literally like coconut cream with some chicken in it. Maybe I've gone to Lotus of Siam too recently to have my tastes spoiled, but after trying 5 dishes I can safely say that I don't know what every other review says is right, perhaps it's even contrived.  She says...  Coming from a Vietnamese gal, I really have to say the broth of the Pho was extremely tasteless. I never seen a restaurant who did not bring out the hoisin and hot sauce when serving Pho. I had to ask the servers for it and after having the sauces for 5 minutes, the servers took it back as if they only had one set. I understand that there might be a possibility that the chef forgot  to add the flavors but we did not receive an apology after telling the server about the Pho. Pad Thai was the best out of all we ordered I have to say. Panang curry was wayyyy to salty. Even with the white rice didn't help hide the saltiness. Servers was very attentive, too much I say, but maybe because we were the only table there at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. I'm usually not to critical when it comes to food but I could not say anything for this restuarant. I give them a solid 2/5."}
{"text":"We ordered from here tonight for delivery, glad I did!   We drove by the other day and saw they delivered, for us it is a game changer for my non cooking nights.  I found the menu online,  Thai we pretty much always order our favorites.  Our normals are this time Shrimp Pad Thai (we got a level 5 out of 10)  Panang Curry ( level 9 ) and  Papaya Salad ( level 7 )  The food was GREAT I loved it and almost reminded me of Thailand i am so happy to find a great place this side of town since our move to this side.  I will be ordering again!!!   I do recommend thinking about your spice level.  This place does not lie, a level 10 might burn your face off.  I order from my spice level from past places and this place is true to word for hotness!   I loved it and will be my Go To Thai place...   Great Job!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Kinda empty on account of them being new, I think. I've only had one dish. Drunken noodle(Pad Kee Mao). It's spicy :-) yummy. I got a seven in spiciness.  I like that it's not overly fishy.  Some Thai places use too much fish paste for my liking.  The lady who takes orders and mans the front shows little emotion but her words are nice.  I can't speak about the taste of the pho but it looked good.   Overall I'd say it's a good place to hold you over when you're hankering for some Thai or Vietnamese food. I like it because it's close to my house. 3.5 stars but rounded up.  Prices higher than Thai places near here"}
{"text":"Always amazing! Favorites include Tom Kha Gai soup and Pad See Ew. Pho is also great! You can't go wrong with these choices. Melvin is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Their seafood pho, summer rolls, veggie pho, and shrimp tempura were delicious!!! The server was very polite and recommended different dishes when my sister was indecisive about what to get. He listened and took what she said into consideration when giving suggestions. The place was a little small, but was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"A mom-and-pop joint serving food made with love. My wife and I have eaten here half a dozen times in as many months--just to see if this place would remain as good as we hoped it might. Decision? Delicious. Again and again. And again.  I blame the master cooks at Lilly's for the two pounds I gained these past six months.  This place is in a nondescript strip mall, but as all longtime Las Vegans know, some of the best neighborhood joints are snugly nestled back in these smaller neighborhood shopping centers. From the sizzling, juicy chicken satay (and god, do NOT miss either the rich, creamy peanut sauce or the crisp, refreshing mini salad that comes with this appetizer) to the pho to a variety of thai curry dishes to the stir-fry, Lilly's offers some of the absolute best Thai food (and Vietnamese, too!) in our part of the valley. The delivery through Yelp is fast and accurate, and the dining-in experience at the restaurant is great, too. Mostly teens work here at night, but these kids are on their game. Great service, great attitude from the servers, very helpful . . . a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Ordered the pho dac biet xe lua and was expecting a massive bowl. I should have read the menu and walked out after seeing that there was only 3 types of meat that came with it. And although broth was great, what came out was a kids bowl with hardly any meat in it. Seriously such a disappointment.  Service was okay. $9 wasted and I'm still hungry. That was basically an appetizer.  My stomach feels a little weird after eating it as well so there might be some MSG in the broth."}
{"text":"This was our first and last visit for dinner using a $10 Restaurant.com coupon.  It was hidden in a small strip mall on W Sahara Ave/near S Rainbow Blvd in Las Vegas.  When we walked in, the owner gestured for us to sit down.  There was only a party of three there with a coupon. A woman walked in with a Groupon and the owner said they are no longer accepting Groupons so she walked out.    They do not have a website but they do have a Facebook page.  They had Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese items on the menu.  The Vietnamese food was reasonably priced.  The curry, duck, seafood, and some of the specialty entrees were expensive.  The tables had burgundy table cloths covered with glass.  A single Cala Lily was in a vase at each table.  Rap music was playing.  The owner took our order, left the menu in our hands and then brought us glasses of water 10 minutes after we walked in.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl and I ordered the Shrimp Rice Plate.  We also ordered the Summer Rolls.  The two Summer Rolls came out on a plate with peanut sauce.  They were not cut in half.  I like my Summer Rolls to be cut in half.  There was no mint or shredded carrot garnish like on the Facebook page.  About 25 minutes after we arrived, the owner told me that thay were out of white steamed rice.  He asked me if I wanted brown rice or noodles.  I said noodles were okay.  Why didn't he tell me that when I ordered #34?  What Asian restaurant runs out of white rice during prime dinner time?  The owner was also the cook.  I could see him frying something.  A young Asian guy walked in and started clearing plates from the other party's table.  He must have been out on a delivery.  The Shrimp and Pork Noodle Bowl had 3 boiled or barely grilled shrimp on a skewer with yellow squash and sliced carrot.  There was about 2 tablespoons of BBQ pork. There was shredded carrot and peanut garnish.  The Shrimp Rice Plate was now a noodle bowl with 2 skewers of 5 shrimp and vegetables with a garnish of shredded carrot and chopped peanuts.  It was served with fish sauce.  I had to ask for a spicy tray to give the entree some flavor.  We did not get a refill of water nor did the owner check on us.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"We saw Lilly's on restaurant.com, so we got a certificate and another couple to join us, and off we went.  I was put off a bit by the exterior - \"Vietnamese and Thai Restaurant\" in hand-painted letters made it look like a take-out joint.  Inside it was rather plain, too well-lit, and lacked much atmosphere, but didn't look like a take-out place.    The menu was huge, and it was hard to decide what to order:  Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese?  Our friend is Vietnamese, so she helped us choose which Pho to order.  The Pho was absolutely delicious!  We also asked for two orders of the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, and she even repeated the Vietnamese name.  But when the first of the two orders came out, it was the fried roll, not the healthier unfried one our friend specified.  Our waitress seemed flustered, didn't speak English very well, and apparently was Thai, and not Vietnamese.  She also didn't seem to have very much experience.  The other hubby ordered the Calamari and he liked it;  I tasted it and it was way too greasy for me.  Our Asian friend had a dish with pork rinds and rice, and when it was served, she was dismayed by the tiny portion of pork;  she said that at other places, there's usually a big mound of it.  Here, she had to do extensive digging before she could even find it.  We also got two orders of Pad Thai, one with shrimp, the other with chicken.  Wee all found it too sweet, and I thought it was unsufferably sweet.  Other than the Pho, there is nothing compelling about the food here, and the service didn't make up for it.  If it weren't for the Pho, I'd be giving Lilly's two stars.  But I guess I'm in the minority, since other reviewers seem to disagree with me.  I guess that's what makes horse races."}
{"text":"I love this place because they have Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food! Sometimes I can't decide on which cuisine I want so I'm glad Lilly's is around so I don't have to choose. My brother had some Pho (Vietnamese Soup) which came in a huge bowl. I'm glad because I wanted some but not a whole bowl so they brought me another bowl so I can have some. I ordered the Drunken Noodles with a side of white rice. This also came in a big serving so my brother had some of that. We also had some egg rolls which went perfect with the meal. I'm getting hungry just writing about this !"}
{"text":"T'was pretty good.....there's another pho place on the same parking lot, which is a little wierd, but I think this place is slightly better, and a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Was decent, nothing special. I like that they are open late. Ordered Sticky mango rice and the rice was really really hard. Like undercooked. Maybe just a bad day for the chef."}
{"text":"I recently moved from Henderson and have needed to find my new go to Thai spot for drunken noodles, found it!"}
{"text":"Tom Kha (sp?) soup was absolutely delicious. Love the option to make anything vegetarian. Drunken noodle was flavorful and not too spicy for the little ones (which is rare). BF got some cashew vegetarian and the sauce was flavorful and delicious. Thai tea was also great. Will most definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Haven't even eaten our food yet!! However I placed an order for delivery about 1 1/2 hours ago and still no food. No call no text no email saying that they were busy or running late. Tried calling and they set the phone to the side and I held for 3 minutes. Called back and they said the driver was on his way but it's been 25 minutes since then! I don't know who's fault this is the restaurant or eatstreet but it's really upsetting! Guess who's not ordering from them again? Or using eatstreet!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials.  Everyone who works there is super nice.  I love the curry.  Plenty of food for a lunch special, so you can take food home.  The service is very good."}
{"text":"The red curry duck was absolutely amazing! The scallop panang was the most perfect I've ever eaten! Both dishes were spicy and accompanied by quality fresh vegetables and perfectly fresh rice! Right down to the coconut ice cream, every detail was thought out! Mmmm"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 dishes to go and it came out to about $55. That's a lot for take out. But, if it's exceptional in taste or value, there's nothing to complain about. Well, it was average in both. It wasn't bad, just not great.   Taste-wise, it was ok. Nothing was really off or funky. But, it wasn't the best Thai ever. Portion-wise, it was on the skimpy side. The square fliplid togo containers were the smaller size of the larger looking kind. And, they weren't really packed full.  I'll be trying different Thai places before I return to this one for another shot."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Their spring rolls are YUM  I really enjoyed their tofu pad Thai. Very clean place, small and the service was excellent. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Lunch for two.  Pad see eew,  Pad Thai,  fried wontons and two beverages for $28. Great deal,  great food and super sweet staff.  Thank you Lillys Yhai & Vietnamese Cafe"}
{"text":"First visit, i usually travel all the way to DownTown for Le Thai. I enjoyed the food, very tasty. I now do not have to travel so far for good Thai food! I am very picky & i was pleased. The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here twice & probably won't ever go back.   On the first occasion I sampled their Thai food. The chicken larb had no flavor and the pad see ewe was over cooked. Both dishes came in such a small portion.   The second time we came at 9pm and the restaurant appeared close. Which is weird since the sign said they were open till 10. The server reluctantly let us in. My chicken pho had the tiniest sad looking little shreds of chicken. The Chinese broccoli was dry and our chicken/rice dish looked unappealing.   The servers were nice and they have a nice beer collection but the food is not good."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore lilies and find myself eating their vegan, or veggie combination for PHO there at least 2 to 3 times every week! Wall every PHO I've had in Las Vegas has been good, very few places make it great. This place in fact does an incredible job and aunts just the right amount of anise, where I found many places either use an overabundance too little or none at all. Anyone who is either made or grown up with someone making fun knows that the perfect amount of Anise is crucial. The only reason why I didn't give Lily is five out of five stars is because every single time I go there for dine in instead of take out The waiter rarely comes back to her table I believe in most circumstances they only came to our table to deliver the food while I understand that waiters and waitresses are busy and have many patrons take care of every single time I've been there I've been the only person who Is doing at the restaurant at the time. While the waiter is always exceedingly friendly and kind a little more attentiveness would be a big bonus however the lack of attention has never impacted I tip nor detracted from my experience however I think improving that attentiveness would definitely reflect a five star rating"}
{"text":"Fresh spring rolls were awesome, ordered the double delight wish was full of flavor, pad thai was also great. The owners were super nice and gave great service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My Gf and I decided to try this place since we normally go to Sidestreet pho nearby.  We both ordered Pho noodles and what you get here is stingy!  Compared to any pho place I have been to this place probably gives the least even for a regular portion bowl.  They didn't ask me for regular or large and wasn't on the menu.  They gave me seriously 3 slices of beef and the noodles weren't alot.  So that wasn't good.   So anyways, as for taste, the soup stock was really bland and light.  Not inspiring or good in the taste department either.  From my understanding they are a thai restaurant more than a vietnamese so maybe ordering the pho wasn't a good idea.  Maybe I'll try the Thai food next time, but I can't give it higher than a 2 for the noodles."}
{"text":"I will be honest and say that I don't come here for the Vietnamese food. I come for the Thai food. It is my favorite place to come for Thai food. I love the pad se ew and it is not on the menu, but the yum woon sen (silver noodle salad) is literally the best one I have ever had. I come in a couple of times a month with my husband. I always order the same thing, the yum woon sen as an appetizer and the pad se ew with seafood. The squid tastes so fresh! My husband has tried quite a few different items on the menu. He has enjoyed every dish he has tried. The server is really nice and the food always comes out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Add these lunch time specials to your rotation! (If you can live without brown rice.) We stopped in for our midday meal, and we were greeted with friendly, attentive service even though they were training a new waitress who couldn't answer all of our questions. However, we ask a lot of goofy questions (can we get this with broccoli only, or that with more garlic, is this a good one, and so on). They were very eager for feedback and special orders did not upset them.   The menu is huge, so it is hard to imagine they can do it all well. We went with some basic stir fry dishes on their lunch specials menu. Fresh, generous and saucy are the three adjectives I would choose. I ordered the garlic chicken with broccoli only, and later in the day, driving down the highway I realized I had an entire chunk of fresh garlic wedged between my back teeth. Not so great for the breath, and perhaps a bit too much information, but a perfect indicator that the chef here is chopping up the cloves by the dozen and cooking them up on the spot in the dishes. The waitress said, \"If you like garlic, you will not be disappointed,\" and she was right! It was very flavorful.   The lunch special comes with a spring roll and is $6.95. A little cup of soup would be a nice addition to the lunch price, but I had enough to eat.   One disappointment was the lack of brown rice. We are avoiding white rice as much as possible these days, so the husband went without rice. I ate about half of the jasmine rice they served, and it was good, just the wrong color. Hopefully, if they get busier, they will add brown rice, and Lilly's will then become a true repeat eat!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this sweet little place and the lovely family that runs it.  I had been running around setting up new doctors and appointments after moving to Las Vegas from  California. Phones, tv, insurance, driver's license, etc. etc.  My head was spinning. I was pooped and hungry and lower than a snake's belly. Was too tired to drop by Von's for a soggy sandwichDon't know why I decided to look around on the other side of their ten mile long (or so it seems) parking lot but I am so glad I did. I had never had POH before but the price was right. It was cold out and Martha Stewart had just been raving about this Vietnamese traditional soup she was making on her show so I said to myself, why not? Good enough for Martha should be good enough for me.  What a comforting and delicious soup.  I don't know how it is supposed to taste. All I know is the shrimp pho I had was just what the doctor ordered. (No pun intended) I was going to take it home to eat but had such a nice time visiting with the owner while waiting for my soup I ate it there. There was enough left over to have for a light lunch the next day and he graciously wrapped it up so it wouldn't spill. Tiny place, big on service and good food. Now that the weather has turned cool finally I am going to go over there and see what else might warm my heart and belly."}
{"text":"Come on now Nothing can't top this place for having the best Thai Food! I really love spicy drunken noodles and pad thai noodles here! This place is really cool! Very clean and employees is so sweet and price is right!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery took over an hour. Order was wrong. The summer rolls are absolutely terrible and they are something I normally enjoy. Also my pho came with brown wilted bean sprouts that smelled rotten. I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Nice job Lilly's.   Kidding.  Usually go to Side street Pho in the same parking lot.  Decided to try you.  Hours say open until 10.  9:40 I enter and you tell me closed.   That's ok.  I'm at Sidestreet Pho."}
{"text":"This place has some really good food, I highly recommend it! I got the tom ka gai and it was better than Le Thai which I thought was the best in town. I also tried the pork larb, yum! The food is fresh and delicious and priced right. Must try!"}
{"text":"I am what they may call picky or high expectations , I am Thrilled with every single item that I got: Summer rolls (cold fresh rice paper w shrimp and the flavors are great) Tom ka gai soup (chicken was on point and I did 3 star spicy which still has heat to it) Sticky rice w mango (I pop in fridge to get cold)"}
{"text":"Worst pho ever. The portions were smaller than any other pho restaurant I have ever been to. It's cheaper than most places, but you get what you pay for. The quality of the meat and the amount of the meat were lacking. This place is uninspiring and lousy. I would rather go to any other place for pho. On a good note, the service was good. SIDE STREET CAFE ACROSS THE STREET IS 100000000 TIMES BETTER, AND THEIR PHO IS ONE OF THE BEST!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I really didn't think the lunch I had, BUN THIT NUONG CHA GlO (charbroiled pork and eggrolls with vermicelli and vegetables) was nearly as good as I have had in several Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas. Maybe it's my fault as I didn't order a Thai dish but with so many Vietnamese dishes on the menu I thought it must be one of their specialties. The rice noodles were fine, prepared well, the fish sauce is fish sauce (I think they all buy the same one) but the charbroiled pork wasn't very good (thick chunks that were not tender or charbroiled looking) and the eggrolls were disappointing. If you like this dish got to Kim Long on Spring Mountain, it's wonderful. I may try Lilly's again but if I do I'll order something Thai."}
{"text":"Was getting my mails done next and decided to stop on by. So glad I did.   They have a lovely dining area. Open floor plan. Average four ppl per table.   Offer lunch specials, great variety too. Most locations limit what they offer. These lunch specials are great.   The portion is a nice size. About half the plate and and egg roll. I nice size plate not a little one. Lol.   Easy to find as well. Definitely want to come try the duck dishes. Smell so good."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since my last review of Lilly's Thai & Vietnamese Restaurant.  So I dropped in for lunch just after 11am on a  Thursday and I had the entire restaurant all to myself until I was 95% done with my meal.  It was pretty awesome, like having your own personal chef and butler :)  After studying the menu for along time, as if I was cramming for a quiz, I ended up ordering Lilly's Chicken Wings again.  It was crispy with good flavor, before being dressed in a modest amount of sauce. It comes with 6 pieces of wings, so it is perfect for sharing. But this appetizer came out last, contrary to my expectation of the order that the dishes I ordered would be brought out to the table.   Lilly's House Noodle. Stir fried noodle in house sauce w/ vegetables and seafood was tasty.  It packed just the right amount of flavor for me, and I would not hesitate to order it in the future.  The Crispy Duck, made with boneless duck, lightly battered and topped with Chef's special sauce was good. Big portion, but the nice crispy duck was covered in sauce.  I was told that was the traditional country style presentation of that dish. I still like it, but felt that it was a shame to undo the crispy duck skin at plating. I liked this duck dish, but will tried one of the other duck items on the menu in the future.  Service was great.  Food was brought out promptly. I also drank a lot of water as it was still rather warm outside, and never had to asked for the glass to be refilled.  4 stars!"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night after 7 pm and were surprised the place was almost empty.  This surprised us because the spring rolls were the best we have had since leaving Chicago.  We used to live a block from a Vietnamese business district and were introduced to spring rolls there.  The green curry was hot and spicy enough with a 6 rating.  My wife also had a vermicelli noodle dish and it was delicious.  Service was personable and the restaurant was very clean.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I am not one who is stingy with my stars, but I am willing to give this place 1 star due to the fact that at least the food was edible (we did not get food poisoning) and the servers were nice enough even if there was a language barrier. We decided to try this place out coz there was a $50 gift cert deal from restaurants.com (must order $100 worth of food,there was 6 of us) and after reading yelp reviews from others(I should've listened to the negative ones, I AM open minded about reviews though, and I figured that the reason behind the negative reviews was because they were not Asian and they were just not used to Asian food, coz most of the reviews  from asians said good things about the place, WELL I AM ASIAN and here is MAI review.) I really don't want to be a hater, but the dining public has to be WARNED. the whole dining experience to SUM it all up was DISAPPOINTING & the food was UNSAVORY, MSG filled and OVERPRICED. I went on an MSG induced coma after that dinner. Now i am going to give you our orders by the $$$  $9 minced pork lettuce wrap (way too salty with frozen veggies), $11fried calamari (very greasy and it was mostly batter little squid), $4 Vietnamese fried spring rolls (2 pcs of mediocre egg rolls) $9BBQ pork(bland no flavor, it wasn't what I wanted anyways, I asked the waitress if they were on skewers and she said yes and they weren't) $9 grilled pork meatball(5 tiny pieces with lettuce and limp noodles, mediocre at best) THATs just appetizers! For entrees we had $8 Pho Dac Biet (contrary to other reviews it was not good. The soup did not taste like real beef broth at all) $10 lemon grass steak (small pieces of beef with tons of  overcooked veggies, green onions mostly, I did not see nor taste any lemon grass, too salty) $9 Singapore noodles (again wrong info from waitress, seems like she just answers yes to every question asked...hmmm) honestly I really did not understand the flavor of this dish, it was not good too. $19 sea bass with ginger sauce, the sauce was good, but the fish was not fresh, it was flaky & dry. $5 Tom yum gai soup bowl (supposed to be with shrimp instead of chicken, but language barrier once again) it was ok, nothing special, the chicken had a stench to it, my nose is really sensitive to that kind of stuff.) DRINKS $3 lychee juice(ok), $3 Thai lemonade (too sweet) DESSERT $6 mango with sticky rice (mangoes were sour, sticky rice & coconut sauce ok) Which leads us to a GRAND total of $153 including 18% gratuity & tax, less $50 gift cert we paid $103 out of pocket, divided between 5 adults, it was $20/person. Now don't get me wrong am not whining about the price nor did I say that the servers where rude, I just thought it was a huge RIP OFF and for the %18 tip we had to leave the service was at best mediocre (they should provide an interpreter) Needless to say I learned my lesson, sometimes what you think is a good DEAL might turn out to be a RIP OFF. Needless to say we are DEFINITELY NOT COMING BACK HERE & I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Yelpers HEED my WARNING, am not giving this review because I was bitter, I just felt it my duty to inform the public. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"No longer accepting Groupons!  I went here last night to use a Groupon (that I purchased Aug 30 and expires in Feb 2013) and there is a sign on the door they are no longer accepting Groupons per management.. I guess they don't want any new business!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch today! The food and service was outstanding, the flavors incredible, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here because of a Groupon. We came here a few weeks ago for lunch with our $30 Groupon in hand.   I started with a Thai tea and my fella got a regular iced tea. The Thai tea was a little on the sweeter side than I would have preferred, but was good. We decided to share a panang curry with pork and a chicken pad thai to share.The curry was pretty good, but I had hoped it would be a little thicker and flavorful. It was just a little more watered down than I had expected. The pad thai was on the slimy side. It wasn't the most pleasant texture, but aside from the texture it had a good flavor, albeit a little on the sweet side.. We finished our meal with a mango and sticky rice. I can never resist sticky rice, so was happy with this rendition. I think I would prefer the coconut ice cream next time to the mango since it wasn't the freshest, but it was a nice way to end our meal.   We had a pretty good meal and I'd be interested in trying out a few more of their menu items that looked tasty.They also have Vietnamese items that looked good as well. The service was exceptional. I'd go back for that alone."}
