{"text":"Love coming here and new owner has a really made it his own. Great food. Great service and free coffee with your meal. Also he loves supporting his community so I had a workshop here and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Please it's nice, but food was very oily, and lacked taste. Also, not worth the price. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is good,  the portions aren't huge but just right.  Get anything with hollandaise, it's magical and the reason I come back!"}
{"text":"Rip off and poor quality and portions for the money! 
Go to Egg Smart or even Halibut House is a better deal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but sadly the dish I got was disappointing :( 

I got the steak and eggs. It was fine. Meh. I measure the cuisine by how much it impresses me and how it takes my tastes buds to a foodie adventure. There was nothing about this dish that made me think- wowsa. It was fine. I just kept thinking, I could've  just stayed home and made this and added fresh fruit. Ugh. Sad story

I should've tried the eggs benne with the smoked salmon. Should've listened to my gut but I didn't so sadly this tale has an unfortunate ending. 

I doubt I'll come here again. But if you do, avoid this mediocre meal and go for what seems to be the fan favs- waffles and bennes"}
{"text":"A good breakfast with good service and not over crowded.  Very accommodating for substitutions to the menu.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly.  

Will definitely come back if in the area again.  

Not many breakfast places nearby so this is worth a try."}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant - our server was very accommodating for my dietary restrictions and food was delicious. My friend had pancakes which were light and fluffy and I had steak and eggs. Great neighbourhood find and will be back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service .. But sadly this food is horrible ! I don't understand why these reviews said the food is delicious , the sausages tasted really bad , the eggs had a fishy taste too it , the bananas is too over ripe also the food is beyond greasy , you can just see old oil all over your plate 

I only liked the rye bread , bacon and water 

Would not recommend and won't be going back"}
{"text":"We love coming here whether it is for breakfast or lunch!!!!!  It is quiet, with delicious food cooked by Duss and Kelvin.  You have to try their waffle with fruit!!!!!!!  There is room to hold a breakfast meeting or lunch meeting!!!  They also do catering!!!"}
