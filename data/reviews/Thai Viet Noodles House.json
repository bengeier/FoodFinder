{"text":"What a hidden gem!   On Independence heading toward Charlotte, just past the Walmart in in Indian Trail, an obscure strip mall. Summer rolls are huge and fresh.  The Pad Kee Mow was hot and spicy.  Beware!  Spice levels are 1, 2 or 3.  I chose 2 and it was super spicy.  Get a one or have lots of ice water on hand.  Hubby got the Pad Thai 3.  Hot enough to make your liver fall out!  But, Oh. So.  Good!! If you're in the mood for great Thai or Vietnamese and you don't want to drive into town, give this place a try.  Totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"The pho was amazing on this very cold night. The hot jasmine tea made with tea leaves in an infuser steamed before bringing to our table was heavenly!  Ate with my teenage son who had a chili ginger chicken dish was thumbs up.  This was as good as the pho restaurant we visited in Richmond va in November but half the price.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I tend to try and go by this place at least once every couple of weeks. If you love Pho, then I highly recommend their Pho Thai. I usually get a large, but a Medium is typically more than enough to fill me up. I have also had their Pud Thai and it is delicious. 
One thing that they serve that many people don't know about is their Bubble Tea (Boba Tea). I usually get the Strawberry, but their other flavors are delicious as well. The staff is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the ingredients in a specific dish."}
{"text":"First visit, but it was a good one!  Brought the kids... they really enjoyed their food.  The staff was extremely friendly and very eager to please.  We'll be back for sure.  I really like that a decent Thai/Viet restaurant has come across the country line, love that my money stays here in Union county."}
{"text":"Looooove this place. The food is fantastic. The service is pretty ok, considering. The owner and his daughter act as service staff and, what one trades off in Westernized service style, one receives in amazing traditional Thai food. My BF loves the Thai Tea and we have yet to have a bad meal. As a recent transplant from the Bay Area, this place gets my two total thumbs up."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food! Hubby had the GA Pho and it was SO delicious! I had the Pad Se Ew (asked for the spice tray so I could add my own level of heat) which was very yummy! One daughter had the Teriyaki Chicken with Mushrooms and rice which came with a bowl of mayo based sauce that she absolutely loved. Our other daughter had Pad Thai with Chicken (she orders this every Asian place we dine) and said it was great. We will be back...and if it's cold enough outside I will be ordering the Pho!"}
{"text":"Great place that serves some of the best Thai and Vietnamese food in Charlotte.

I've been a customer for years at the families other place Viet Thai noodle house. Serviceis fast and friendly and the Food is outstanding and affordable. 

Some favorites of mine are the summer rolls, the pho, House special Bun, Pad Thai, and the pad ka praw.

Check them out you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"The service was great and everyone there was super friendly. Food was great too! Love the concept of both Vietnamese and Thai cuisines. Kind of in a traffic-heavy shopping center (without a light) of Independence where it takes a minute to turn out of but worth the minor inconvenience."}
{"text":"This place is great! Almost a hidden gem. I usually stick with Spicy Red Curry with chicken and it is phenomenal but I have also had their tofu and pud thai and those were great as well. Its worth a visit and is also family friendly."}
{"text":"Obviously most reviewers have not eaten good Thai food. Wanted to wash my hands before we ordered and the women's restroom was filthy. Decided to try food anyway because of great reviews. Ordered the Pud Thai. While waiting for food I decided that I needed to check their sanitation grade... It was only an 87.5. That is not good, and neither was the food. No lunch menu, the cheapest dishes start at $8.75 which is expensive for what you get. Not worth wasting your money on this place."}
{"text":"Some of the best good I've had in Charlotte!! Totally worth going!!  I normally don't write reviews or even trust reviews cause when I go to places they just ok or pretty terrible!! I was really excited when this place was good!! Check it out for yourself!!"}
{"text":"The first few times I went to this location the food was great, and the service was great as well. Although one time I go in to the restaurant to pick up take out and I noticed their sanitation grade was 82. Cleanliness and sanitation grade are key."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once so far because the whole household doesn't eat Asian cuisine but I really enjoyed it. Not too many places in Union County to get this kind of food and it was reasonably prices. Would recommend it to anyone. Sure beats driving into Charlotte for the same thing at a higher price."}
{"text":"This place is great. Moving from Portland, Oregon here 3 years ago finding good Thai can be very difficult. This place has a great mix of oriental flavors. I can't get everything here that you can get on the West Coast because of availability of products, but what they offer is very good. The owner is very friendly and knowledgeable; this daughter helps out who is a real sweetheart. I'm still working my way through the many menu items and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Thai Viet based on the few reviews I saw.  This place is off the main road in a strip mall.  It isn't a great location but the experience was excellent.  A better location could help bring more clients.  The service was good.  I was the only person in the place for lunch so I wouldn't expect anything else.  The food was great.  I had the shrimp tempura appetizer.  I was surprised how great is was and it came with shrimp and vegetables too.  Very nice presentation and delicious.  In addition, I had the hibachi steak with the noodles on the second to last page,  this was the best I have had.  This meal was a great deal of food so I am planning to bring some home for the wife to enjoy.  Please recommend to others and please try it yourself.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay fellow Yelpers, another great recommendation from YOU! 
First off, it's kinda hard to find this place, but definitely worth the effort. Thai Viet is across Independence from The Chrystal Shoppe, about 1/4 mile from the light at the Wal Mart.
I love Thai food and prior to this, DeeJai was my favorite. Emphasis on WAS. The food is better, and the prices lower. We had summer rolls w/basil, pho w/beef and the wide noodles with chicken in brown sauce. (can't remember name, sorry) Everything was fresh tasting. I'll have to admit, I never tried pho before. BIG mistake. It was awesome. Order with rare beef, it cooks in the broth. Anyway, if you are out this way and don't try Thai Viet, your bad, cause you're missing great service, awesome food and very reasonable prices. 
When you do go, you'll probably see me. I'll be the one with the HUGE bowl of pho and a very contented smile on my face :{)

mi penri (you're welcome)"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai and Vietnamese food I've had outside of Charlotte proper.  It's a small place and sometimes the waitress is hormonal but the food makes up for literally everything else.  The location isn't super convenient and some nights they are crowded and close however overall this is a must-try if you enjoy Asian food or are wanting to try it

I've enjoyed the Pad Thai several times as well as the Drunken Noodles.  Their spice level isnt exact and if you arent sure, go light of you may find out how it feels to have melting eyeballs!

Their Vietnamese options are worth trying as well.  I've not had much Vietnamese food so I don't have much to compare yet, however the Pho I had was really good. Their bubble tea is also a nice treat and worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many great meals here.  The menu has a nice variety of Vietnamese and Thai dishes.  The staff is very friendly and very helpful explaining how the various dishes are made and are quick to offer suggestions for something new to try.  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are not bad at all.  I highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's the closer to my house and also I loved their food especially the Vietnamese Soup Pho.. I always get the beef combinations. The server is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A welcome surprise on my drive home. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of delicious Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte and this another solid one to add to the list!  Great, small, open space, clean and brand spanking new!

The fresh basil rolls were delicious loaded with crisp lettuce and herbs, that's my favorite part!!  If you order a dish spicy, it arrives spicy, this makes me happy.  They also top their vermicelli dishes with grilled onions, you want an onion with every bite!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food for a small place in Indian trail North Carolina. If you are concerned about atmosphere maybe you should move to a town that has some lol."}
{"text":"Who knew you'd find a good Thai/Vietnamese restaurant all the way down Independence? Indian Trail now houses this little shining star and beckons all those who crave Pad Thai, Pho, and boba tea. 

Once the typical Sunday Thai craving set in, my wife and I were listing off our typical go-tos as we thumbed through our bookmarks. Enter: Thai Viet. One of the places we had yet to try and decided to traverse ever-hated Independence Blvd for a taste. 

The unsuspecting space rests amongst a few other small businesses in a strip right off of 74. Not much to look at from the road and the sign is kinda small. If you're headed south, just look for it on your left about 2-3 miles after you pass under I-485. 

The interior is pretty plain. Just booths and a few knickknacky things for decor. We got our menus and started with some tempura veggies. \"Meh\" is all I can say about these. We should have known better to get these, but they did sound so good. The veggies were a little too tender for some and pretty bland. The sauce they came with was reminiscent of Japanese steakhouse \"white sauce\" and was overtly sweet. Not my bag. 

For entrees, I went with the Pud Thai and added the seafood mix. Not a typical order for me, but I wanted to try something new. Brilliantly flavored rice noodles, a smattering of veggies throughout, and a mix of mussels, shrimp, crab, squid, and scallops. The seafood was pretty fishy and might not have been the best grade from the day's catch. I picked around most of it, but at least tried a bit of each. It was definitely interesting and I'm glad I tried it. The noodles and usual Pad Thai suspects within were spot on. 

The owner was really nice and upfront with my wife about the veggie Pho. He even claimed, \"Well, if you want veggie broth, it will be pretty bland.\" Really great to have that honesty. Though we didn't find it to be bland at all! It was packed with veggies and just needed a little sprucing up with Sriracha. Love the mix of their broth(s), too. 

The price was ridiculously affordable. Competitive compared to some of the other places in town. 

Should we be in the area, or just in the mood for more Thai/Vietnamese in the near future, Thai Viet will be in the mix."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai and super service make this one to return to!  Will be trying more of the Thai- Vietnamese menu."}
{"text":"I don't care for this food very much it was greazy  and not much flavor and the noodles were badly cooked and the shrimp were overcooked. me and my partner could not even finish our food it was a total waste of money I'm sorry but if you're looking for below average Thai food this is the place for you.If I could I would give it a zero just really bad food."}
{"text":"We got the summer roll. It was great, fresh, and tasty. The sauce was a little too peanutty for me, but, it was still good.

We also got the pho. Now, my favorite is Vietnam Grill on South Blvd. But, this is close to home, and their pho was very tasty. The broth flavorful, the noodles perfect, veggies fresh and crisp.

Can't wait to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to break 5 star roll this place was on buuuuuuut......honestly this place was just below okay... I was on this side of town and because of other Yelp reviews I tried this place for lunch.   Walking in at around 1pm this place was dead empty.  Upon sitting down about 3 others entered and sat down.  I was wondering why this place was so empty at lunch and now I know why.  I ordered the summer roll and spring roll as an app.  The summer roll was bland and the lettuce inside was slightly brown and lacked freshness.  The piece of old lettuce that was placed on the plate as a garnish was limp and had brown edges...Gross.  The spring roll was pretty good.  

Now on to the entree, I ordered the Pho with the meat raw on the side as I do at all Vietnamese restaurants.  The thinly sliced raw meat was brown...I just put it in my soup because I was too hungry to complain....the broth lacked aroma and flavor.  I tried to doctor it up with different sauces...just didnt work...I probably had 5 bites.  My BF had some noodle dish the owner recommended and he wasnt crazy about it either. He said the flavor got old.. 

Im annoyed we spent $40 on a 2 star lunch as I dont mind spending money on good food that is fresh and well made. There are much better options in Charlotte for vietnamese.  Hope Yelpers arent getting this place confused with Viet-Thai Noodle House which Ive never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is great and the owners are extremely friendly.  Don't be afraid of the extensive menu; all of the dishes we've had are top notch.  The wait staff is great at recommending dishes too.  This is the best restaurant in Indian Trail in my opinion, and one of the best Thai/Viet restaurants in Charlotte.  Good food at a good price..it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Thai, Vietnamese and Hibachi!  

We ordered a Thai Dish \"Pad Kee Mow\" Wide Flat Noodles, Stir-fried with Vegetables and Shrimp and a Vietnamese Dish \"Vermicelli Bowl\" with Chicken, Shrimp, Spring Roll, Beef and Pork!  Both Dishes were 5 yelp stars!  These were some of the BEST Asian Dishes I have ever eaten!

The Portions are Bigger and the prices did not come from Charlotte!  More Food!  Great Quality, Superb Service, Lower prices, I'm not dreaming, though it feels like it!

Hey POPROCK LOVE, they are serious about SPICE levels here, if you order, spice level two it is pretty hot (not sweating nor hallucinating) just about right, (pretty spicy HOT!)!  If you order 3 level spiciness I do not know what would happen, though I'd like to be there when it does! 

Iowa's loss is Indian Trails gain!  A Thai Chef from Thailand via Iowa (it sounded funny to me too!)  The Chef here has SKILLS!

The interior is the opposite of most Thai or Vietnamese places, lots of Red, everything looks NEW and clean!

Readers: if you are new to Thai or Vietnamese Cuisine... Look at the food everyone else is ordering and get some ideas!  The staff here has a LOT of experience and will help you pick something you'll probably LOVE!"}
{"text":"Had pho last night at this place it was so freakin good! The bean sprouts and basil were fresh the broth was clear, the meat was tender. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get their pho fix I am hooked. I also had the pad kee mow for the first time and I fell in love, I ordered mines spicy and it was perfect I love spicy but when there is still flavor and not just hot and they made it perfect. Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"Had the Pud Thai which is wonderful with beef and the same as Pad Thai anywhere else. Love it and the sliced orange slices. Also ordered Chicken Satay with two sauces, my favirite is the peanut sauce. Comes with carrots and broccoli as well as orange slices. Fyi.....they are now OPEN on Tuesday and closed on Monday. Looking forward to delivery in September 2015 woo hoo!!"}
{"text":"I would give them 6 stars if possible.....The summer roll was big and delicious sooooo good. I got the Mi Dac Biet the broth was amazing the seafood was perfectly cooked I can't rave enough about this. My Bf got Pho Dac Biet and and he raved about it as well. This was so good we ordered the same the next night. I cant believe this place is so close to home. I will be back here again."}
{"text":"First time here but will not be our last :)
Food was great and you could not ask for friendlier service!"}
{"text":"Based on my one meal I'd say very good, better than some  but not \"hands down the best in Charlotte\". It's not even in Charlotte anyway! 

I had entered Stallings instead of Indian Trail in my Garmin and it lead me astray. I spent one hour in the bumper to bumper traffic going up and down 74 looking for it, only found it by asking in Viet nail salons - didn't see Mimi. 

I don't know it they have a lunch menu but Saturday 3 pm I paid dinner prices.
Shrimp Tum Yun : largish portion but priced accordingly ($7) as an appetizer you're better off sharing it. I asked for hot and that's what I got, cleared my sinuses right up. Good, all the original ingredients were there, personally I could have done without the pineapple chunks and with less salt but that's just me. 

For the main dish I asked the waiter which had the most flavor: the Thai lemongrass chicken, or the Viet special dish which is a mixed grill. The guy said the chicken and I went with that.

What I was served was a plate of *intense* curry , nothing at all like the Viet lemongrass dishes at Doan or Ben Than, more like an Indian curry than the typically lighter Thai curries too. There was more flavor in that dish than in all of Thai taste's menu combined.

I wish the location was more convenient, traffic on Independence makes it chore getting there. I might have rated it 3 1/2 stars if it wasn't for all the 5 stars it's already gotten"}
{"text":"Really good hole in the wall in Monroe. Best aromatic soups, service could be better but the flavors are worth the waiting, server was very nice and helpful, really good prices."}
{"text":"Disappointing. 

I grew up in Southern California so I was utterly spoiled with ethnic foods. Since moving to Charlotte 5 years ago I've become a bit cynical of Asian restaurants (near where I live ) subsequently lowering my expectations. Still, I keep an open mind and try new places. 

A couple of weeks ago I was in El Monte, California and swallowed a bowl of Pho. It was extraordinary, perfectly balanced with broth that was prepared for hours and crisp fresh herbs over quality noodles (all noodles are NOT alike). Today I was craving Pho so based on the reviews, tried this place. 

The waiter was horrible. The lack of service was equally matched with food that tastes like the canned variety on the \"ethnic\" isle at Harris Teeter. I can still taste the MSG in my mouth. Perhaps some vinegar and and a squirt of our pets \"no chew\" spray might cleans my mouth!  The curry was bland, the chicken in the Pad Thai seemed, well, old; like they bought a dozen from some geriatric home for chickens. Yuk! 

The worst was the the Pho!  I think I figured out the recipe; tap water from Union County's newly contaminated reservoir (this just happened), can of Pho seasoning from isle 6 at Harris Teeter, sticky beef (I'm not sure how they accomplished this but several of the thin beef slices were stuck together, I couldn't pull them apart so I left it alone), seven cubes of MSG and Basil leaves, sucked of all flavor and smelled like cardboard. 

Okay, where's the beef?  Well, look at my pic.  I have never seen what seems like bleached beef. Maybe they bred the geriatric chicken with an albino cow?  How does this happen?  Oddly the flavor was okay but we couldn't get passed the color. 

Normally I'm not this hateful but even the bubble tea had chunks of hardened mix in it. We should have stayed home and broken into the frozen peas I used after I had me vasectomy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place BUT:

The service is SO slow for pho. What is taking 15-20 minutes? Hasn't the broth been done for hours? If you taste it, you can tell it hasn't been. The egg rolls- do you know those nasty, peppery ones that you get at cheap Chinese places? Yeah, it's those. 

There are way too many noodles for the measly amount of broth you get.  
The last time I was there, I only ate the noodles and I was so low on broth, that when I needed a to-go container, I had to ask for more broth to be added. (not that it was very good- but what good are the noodles without it?) The owner was getting yelled at in the back by his wife maybe? And it took 10 minutes just to bring out a cup more \"broth\" for me to take home. 
 
If you are in the area, try Saigon Kitchen if you can't make it to Central, it's much better. The egg rolls will leave you happy also."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Both Thai and Vietnamese dishes are great.  My favs are bun dac biet ( house spl vermicilli noodle bowl), pho Bo vien and fried rice. Summer rolls are always fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"We just had some delicious bun! As new-to-Vietnamese diners, we had only a sketchy idea of what to expect. Bun, it turns out, is a combination of soup and salad on one bowl. Crispy, fresh vegetables with rice noodles, cilantro and peanuts with your choice of meat added. Full of flavors and a plentiful amount of food. Also, one of the best egg rolls we've ever had. 
The service is friendly and helpful, the prices are good and the menu has plenty of choices. It's not the prettiest place we've ever been, but we'll certainly be back. That green curry is calling me."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The service was attentive. Had large Pho Ga and couldn't believe the size if the portions. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Tremendous food with great taste and variety. Exterior and interior will not dazzle you but high quality food at a reasonable price are much appreciated. No pretentiousness here just very good food. We will be back. ( we had the Pho Ga, Kang Dang, and Tom Yum Kai )."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much. It's very small and in a shopping center where it doesn't quite fit. 

We were the only diners there for lunch on a rainy Saturday, which was initially worrisome. Clearly, though, everyone else is missing out. 

The pho is excellent. The broth is so good, it was a challenge to keep my dish flat on the table instead of slurping straight out of the bowl. Great amount of food; not too much to put away in one meal. 

The service was unfortunate though; a very young man, likely high school age, who didn't know very much about the food and asked us what appetizers we'd like before we'd even opened our menus. With more training, he could be a good server. 

I'll be back, for sure. Pho season is coming."}
{"text":"Was hoping this place would be just as good or better than Viet Thai Noodle House (Pineville NC).  It wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, the Pho was great but everything else needs improvement.  Ate there twice, first time with my friend and the second time with my wife and younger daughter.  
First visit -  food was good and service was fast (holiday Monday around 2pm)
Second visit - food was bland and customers that came after us got their food before my wife's food was delivered to the table.  It was like they forgot her order or something.   This was in the evening on a weekday.  

Overall, I won't be going back.  I will spend the extra drive and go to the one in Pineville instead."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and very good variety of Thai, Vietnamese, and even some Japanese hibachi style dishes. This is my 2nd time eating here and both times the food has been great!
I have done take out both times, but the restaurant itself seems very pleasant. The decor is simple, with an Asian feel, seats about 40-50, and has a flat screen available to watch your favorite game.
PS-They are waiting on their alcohol license, so that should be coming soon..."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte. Fresh ingredients, made to order per order, overall great tasting food. I've had the summer rolls which are very refreshing especially in hot weather. The peanut dipping sauce that it comes with pairs very well with it. We had Pad see ewe shrimp and the red curry with tofu both great dishes. Ms Vicky is a great cook and very welcoming to all costumers. If you want great tasting Thai/viet food and can appreciate the flavors and preparation come here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Friendly staff, wonderful food. 

I have been there too many times to count, but due to the location I typically order over the phone and pick it up to eat at the office or at home. Never disappointed.

A delight to have in the Indian Trail area!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and it was clearly excellent. Not only was the food great but the environment was quite warm and pleasant!  A pleasant surprise for this area..."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST Thai, Vietnamese in Charlotte! We had dinner there for the first time and loved it! Their summer rolls and peanut sauce are awesome, Pad Thai is without a doubt the best in the area!!! We also had Mi Tom soup with Chicken instead of shrimp and honestly it was so delicious I could have just had it with the noodles and veggies. I think my favorite part though was the FRESH tea! It came in a pot with the leaves soaking and it was so, so yummy! If you are looking for a sweet treat when your meal is done I recommend the Coconut bubble tea. The prices were very fair, food presentation was great and it was all so fresh!! I highly recommend you check this place out and don't be afraid to share some dishes so you can try more than one thing. I'm looking forward to getting lunch there tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"The location is quite small but seating area is nicely laid out. 

Let me first say that I have taken my mother's seafood pho for granted. Not a lot of pho joints offer seafood pho on the menu unless you ask if they have an off menu dish. 

I had the seafood pho while my husband ordered chicken tom yum and pho ga. Our broths were alright until we added hoisin. The bottle itself was watered down and had an odd taste not like the usual hoisin. The chicken broth tasted straight up from a can. My husband took a few bites and couldn't finish it. And he LOVES his pho so it was sad to see him not happy with the taste. I forced myself to finish as much as I could after that horrible hoisin incident. 

The tom yum is pretty good. The hottest is 3 stars. Not that very high and although it tasted as if from a can, it was a LOT better than the pho ga.

The waitress whom seemed like (probably the mum of the shop) today wasn't her day so she seemed hurried. When a group of usual came in, her attitude changed drastically towards them but it remained the same towards us and another party. I overheard her cutting someone who was telling her their order. Maybe my husband is right and she was having a bad day and worked the floor alone or, she's just ??

We would probably return if we're on that part of town and order other dishes besides pho. Otherwise, I will stick to my usual pho joint. 

(UPDATE: We stopped by tonight due to the other place being closed. The tom yum ended up being better as well the niece of the shop was kind and a lot patience. I ordered the summer rolls and it's pretty large than the other places we've gone to. I'm not sure if they usually put pork in it as well but the only meat was shrimp. They also have a few flavors of bubble tea which I have yet to try out.)"}
{"text":"Incredible food and friendly (very informal) staff.  Owner, John came over and talked for a while.  Very friendly and honest person.  

Do yourself a favor and visit often.  Can't go wrong, good portion sizes and surprisingly affordable for this cuisine. 

Can't say enough good things about it.

Stick with the Thai food and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the dining room floor and bathroom are filthy.
The seating is extremely uncomfortable.
For these reasons alone I will not be returning.
The summer rolls were BLAND as was the runny peanut sauce that comes with them and they are huge.
The Tom Kai Kai soup tasted like it was based with whipping cream and the soup contained huge chunks of raw ginger
The chicken green curry basil was delish but full of potatoes which is typically only served with yellow curry."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Anything can be made vegetarian!!  Friendly staff!  Local business!!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything we eat here, the freshest foods and original tea, can't say how much we love it"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Union county. Not to mention the friendly service and large menu. The placement may be a little inconvenient to pull in and out of when there's traffic but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Viet-Thai Noodle House in a different part of Charlotte, the menu is very much similar: mostly Thai and Vietnamese inspired.

Perhaps the most difficult part of finding this location is getting there - maneuvering on Independence is bad enough, but then you have to determine exactly which part of the strip mall you are getting to, and that can be challenging. Once you're there, however, you have plenty to choose from, and the staff is generally helpful in getting you there.

The portion sizes are decent, though the prices are a bit on the high side (this could be because, as has been mentioned elsewhere, we went on a weekend afternoon - lunch prices could be available during the week).

As to food quality: Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, but due to access and prices, it may not be worth making a trip if you're a ways away."}
{"text":"Went here last night - food was great!  Friend had pad thai and raved about it.  Wife had beef w/mixed veggies and loved it.  I had chicken krapow and loved it.  We will go back.

Service was inconsistent, which is why these guys only get 4 stars.  I will still go back again despire service troubles because the food is that good!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to get quick take out food. The young kid who works up front is always so friendly on the phone and in the store. The other employees are always polite and kind. I've gotten pho almost everytime im sick and they take good care of me. The pad Thai is great as well. Five star spicy!!"}
{"text":"We get this any time we can!!  We live hours away but at times commute past this restaurant and if we can't stop we get take out. They are fantastic at packaging items to go and are still beautiful when we get the home (2 1/2 hours away!) which is amazing.  Love love love!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  The pad thai is amazing! Super friendly waitress I think it's family owned. Great service and you don't feel  rushed. My daughter in law is Korean and it's spot on. She tries all the authentic food and lives it. I'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"The food was good the first few times, but It must have been a bad day or something because the place was so dirty that we left after we got our drinks. The table and our glasses were dirty and there was a booth filled up with somebody's belongings. Also, the usual owner and staff appeared to be missing. Don't know if we'll be coming back just because of how dirty it was."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and it was really great at first...even though the prices are really high. But the last two times seems like the food has totally changed. May be under new ownership?  Too bad, it was good enough for us to pay this price, but now we'll go to a place up towards the city. It's cheaper and the food is MUCH better."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were very good.

Beware of the \"Meat Ball Pho.\" I notice there was pieces of white, fatty matter in the meatballs... After realizing that it wasn't onion, I asked the waitress what it was,... She responded \"tendon.\" 

..........


Yeah,... I didn't finish my meal. 

My friend really enjoyed her tofu pho though."}
{"text":"You will NOT find better Thai/Vietnamese food in Charlotte. Period. Do yourself a favor and get the Pho Ga. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"Slow service does not even come close to describing this take out scene. Being in the business, I will cut people an inordinate amount of slack but this is crazy. Excuse making and incompetence. While I wait over an hour for  a small to go order. Sad because I live nearby and like the food. This food would need to be really special for me to ever come back here."}
{"text":"This post goes out to all the fine folks who make Indian Trail home; please visit this restaurant so it survives!  The food is really full flavored and authentic, so you will enjoy the experience.  The place has only been opened since this spring, and the owner is trying to spread the word.  I live in metro Atlanta, but was passing thru and saw the great reviews on YELP.

This is a family owned restaurant, with the young daughter playing \"hostess\" and she does a nice job explaining the specials (when she's not doing homework!).    

I am vegan, so I ordered the Angry Dish with Tofu.  Super delicious and perfectly spicy.

The restaurant is not super visible from the road, and the strip center it's located in is not fabulous, but the location is clean, and the folks are friendly.

Please give the place a try, so it will still be in business when I pass thru again in the future.  Your taste buds will thank you..."}
{"text":"Authentic, family owned and run.  The wife and I travel a lot and are rather picky.  So happy to find a local gem like this."}
{"text":"So I finally figured out that there is a Thai place in Indian Trail. For my first visit, I opted for take out. Found the place ok. It's in a tiny strip of stores next to the Walmart. You have to do a U turn on Hwy 74 at the Walmart to get into the parking lot. Small place with red tables. Ordered the Pad Thai and two spring rolls. The spice level is 1,2 or 3. 3 being \"Hot, Hot, Hot\". I went with a level 3. I really enjoyed the flavors and the heat of the Pad Thai. I was really expecting the level 3 to be extremely spicy but it wasn't. The spring rolls were crisp and fresh. The sweet dipping sauce that came with it was a nice accompaniment. This place offers both Thai & Vietnamese food. I'll be back to try some more soon."}
{"text":"I got noodles to go. The noodles were good, but I'm glad I got it to go. The restaurant just reeked of in-scents. The smell was too strong for me. But very nice staff and good noodles. I'll do take out again."}
{"text":"I'm not a Pho or Pad Thai expert by any means, but I enjoyed my meal here and would be willing to return.  Dining room is cozy, not very fancy but I wasn't here for ambiance.  If you live in Indian Trail / Monroe / Matthews / Stallings, etc.... and you like Asian food but are tired of the same old greasy stuff, give this place a try.  There are some unique flavors and ingredients you do not get at typical Chinese take out joints."}
{"text":"This place is one of regular spots. They have great pho, pad thai,  and papaya salad. Generous serving sizes. Nothing hits the spot like pho on a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"What a little treasure of a restaurant, especially for the Indian Trail area. John the owner is so friendly & passionate about introducing people to Thai food. 

I dined on Pad Thai with pork.  The ingredients they use are wonderfully fresh. The meat in my entree was not a cheap after thought but tender delicious quality cut of pork in and of itself even without the accompanying noodles. It was deeeeelish!  My honey had the red curry rice dish. We also sampled spring rolls & the spicy chicken soup - no complaints, all tasted great!  Thoughtfully seasoned and wonderful balance. 

Thai food is on track for healthy living!  It's fresh ingredients combined to create unique amazing flavors that wake up our Americanized senses and wow, I don't know about you, but I kinda dig that.

If you come at a busy time of day, hey be patient please!  It's not crappy McDs food!  It's fresh homemade food made to order just for you, so keep your panties un-bunched and wait. It's worth it!

Needless to say, I'll be back.

{"text":"I found this little place in the area because I waned some Thai cuisine. It's located in a little strip mall that is s but hard to get to especially if you are in lunch time traffic on Independence, but I got there eventually. 

The food is great, as I had the Ginger Chicken and the service is good and pleasant.  I've had a lot of Thai over the years and this is better than most.  You don't get any soup or spring rolls like other places give but that doesn't distract from the taste.

I was really disappointed they have no lunch menu as I looked for it twice. Be prepared to pay full menu price if you go any time of the day.  Like most Asian places you do get a lot of food, but as you do at other prices, with tip $15 for lunch is high for my blood.

That being said if you go and split your plate you might be alright but a guy on lunch break will probably try the other Asian place down the street to find the lunch menu."}
{"text":"This tiny little place packs a ton of flavor! We get takeout often but have eaten in as well. The owner is such a sweet and helpful lady. The food is so good! Love the pho salad, the spicy shrimp appetizer, chicken soup and bubble tea!

Lemon grass chicken!! So good. Angry shrimp. Mmm."}
{"text":"So happy to know there is a wonderful and truly authentic Thai place in Indian Trail!  Woo hoo!  We ordered shrimp tempura, green curry, teriyaki noodles, and pad thai.  The food is definitely worth it and can be a \"go to\" place for many (instead of the First China restaurant that you like but makes you sick after you eat it). It comes with healthy portions and good prices.  I'm Thai and a native of Chicago where the food just can't be beat, and finally I have a place that I am excited to order from again."}
{"text":"Prices were too high for too little portions. The meatballs and beef pieces in my pho tasted artificial, like Spam. The menu said the pho broth was nothing more than pepper and MSG soup. The spring rolls tasted ok, but once again not worth the dollar/each price."}
{"text":"First time I was here I liked it.  Second time I just didn't order something I liked.  Next time?  After reading their abysmal health inspection reports I won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in the area for sure. Tons of options as well as some very tasty generously portioned pho and other Vietnamese option. I particularly enjoy their Bun bowls and fresh rolls. Curries are aromatic and well spiced. Lovely little spot for Thai and Vietnamese fans."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant only cuz we had a restaurant.com voucher. But, once we got there, we were told they don't accept it.. That was disappointing since we were famished and had travelled too far from the city (in Indian trail) just to get here.. However, the staff was extremely nice and the service was great! 

On the food front, we had spring rolls and fried chicken as appetizers.. Though it tasted great, it was way to oily.. For our main course we had their spicy Thai fried rice and yellow curry.. It was really delicious and it makes up for the distance factor and the oily apps.. The portions were really huge too.. The most I've ever seen being served at any Thai restaurant so that was a pleasant surprise.. 

I would definitely go again, only if I happen to be in that area! Recommend it to whoever lives in the Mathews/Indian Trail area and the ones who are passing by!"}
