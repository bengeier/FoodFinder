{"text":"Since my wife has turned me into a bit of a Francophile I've been on the lookout for authentic French places. On the recommendation of a friend, stopped in quickly for a sample. 

Croissant and pain au chocolat were just like we had in France. Flaky and buttery. Baguette was perfect, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 

It was noon so there people eating but service seemed a little slow. Also, they were out of a number of items which seemed a bit odd for noontime. Later in the day I could understand. 

Would really like to try some other pastries and one of their lunch meals but overall very promising!"}
{"text":"If there is still freedom of speech in this country I have to say I did not like their bread, I have had French bread in many different cities, specially in (yes!!!) Europe! And I did not think, personally, that this could be considered an authentic French bakery. But that's just me, a mean, frustrated, hateful,real french bread lover!"}
{"text":"Great find! Excellent service with authentic french baked goods. Highly recommend the pistachio brioche with white chocolate chips. Quiche florentine was great as well. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I thought livin in SF for so long has gave me a chance to try some of the best French cafes n bakeries the Bay Area has to offer. But nothin prepares me for the genuinely authentic French gourmet Las Vegas has been hidin. Delices Gourmand is one of those hidden gem u thought u could only get a chance to enjoy by flyin to Paris, France."}
{"text":"WOW! I was a little concerned that this place was next to a CVS and Jiffy Lube, but it is legit. Best off the beaten path find in a while. Croissants were world class and the rest of the menu (including our crepes and sandwiches) was fantastic. Also don't leave the blueberry tart or Nutella muffin behind!"}
{"text":"I will most definitely come back to this bakery for their surprisingly delicious goodies... It's worth overlooking the lack of customer service exhibited by the gentleman at the counter.
Their almond-chocolate croissant was very moist and crispy from the outside, their Linzer cookies were alright, their Nutella and raspberry muffins were very tasty and moist, overall a good bite!"}
{"text":"A Las Vegas Gem tucked 2 miles West of the Las Vegas Strip on Sahara and Valley View. I spotted this place while driving and really only wanted a cup of coffee. When I entered the place the smell of the fresh pastries was more then I could take, I had a coffee, a breakfast sandwich and a cheese danish (the first time).  The bakeryis truly french, made fresh and delicious. The staff is very nice and eager to help with your selections. Venture off to this place you will not regret it. YES they do take AMERICAN EXPRESS !!!"}
{"text":"We ran out of clubs and the chemicals that fuel the night. We needed some Java and a little something to prove to ourselves we still had mouths. The sun was just bouncing off of the black sea of a strip mall as the car wash and office supply stores were squeaking to an early morning. Delices Gourmands French Bakery welcomed us like the sand welcomes its lizard royalty. 

This is a place where industry meets cafe. The place looks like a commercial bakery that, thank the good lord, is open to consumers.

The bakery has incredible breads and sweets but no cakes. We believe you can special order those.  They also have crepes, omelettes and sandwiches.

We ate some delicacies that could not decide if they should be in heaven or if they should be on earth. We also questioned whether perhaps we were in heaven or on earth. 

This place could use some help in the service department. You order at the counter, then find a seat -a task that gets harder as Delices Gourmands grows in popularity. Then you wait.  Sometimes the food comes scattered so some guests start earlier than others. 

But the food will bewitch you into returning over and over to try everything. It's that good."}
{"text":"Today is the second time being here and can't complain, everything tasted pretty good so far. 1st time, came in for lunch with a friend and I order the smoked salmon scramble on a brioche it came with a side salad and that was delicious. Also order the caramel macchiato and it was way too sweet that I could even finish half the medium size order. Way too sweet! Today, I brought my kids for an after school treat and we order a few macaroons, cheese danish, almond croissant, coffee eclair and an Apple danish and it's quite good. 
During the 2 visits I got the same cashier and he was not very friendly or personable, does not greet you, thank you or smile. Oh well, only here for the pastry."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, and wouldn't come back unless it was very convenient.  I ordered the ratatouille quiche, which came with the saddest side salad (of the one-cucumber-one-tomato-iceberg-lettuce-thick-dressing variety).  The quiche was fine.  

Also ordered a palmier, and THAT was quite tasty.  So maybe my ordering was off, and I should have focused solely on the baked goods?  Who knows.  Prob won't come back to test this theory out.

As noted elsewhere: very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.  Had the veggie omelet, enjoyed it immensely.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is quality thru and thru!  Excellent breakfast crepes, they are big enough to share, breakfast sandwiches are amazing and pastries and coffee are delicious!  Def gonna be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Talk about a hole in the wall! Diamond in the rough, outside is rough, but inside is awesome, clean, and smells amazing! They have their own bakery there and everything is made there. Amazing sandwich, croique monsiuer, with an egg on top! Simply amazing. The best part is the desserts, like the fruit tart and the almond croissants! If you like almond croissants, you must go here, it's one of the best croissants in Vegas. Easy parking and super nice people working there to go along with it. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had their Paris Crepe. It was ham and cheese with a fried egg on top. It was delicious! I got an eclair to go and had it eaten by the time I got to the car. I took a baguette for the house. It was so fresh! I recommend this place. Their selection of other desserts looked really good as well. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried their Bacon quiche, chocolate croissant and fresh fruit tarte. All SO fresh and delicious. If you're looking for an authentic French bakery, look no further. This place is a hidden gem! Prices are also so reasonable. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Great new place in Vegas near CSN Sahara West #esl Center for treats, like French pastries!"}
{"text":"WARNING GREAT PASTRIES!!! HABIT FORMING! 

My husband and I found this place one rainy day when we were looking for a afternoon nibble. It is everything you want in a French Bakery, Friendly Staff, Almond Croissants that taste like heaven and most importantly you can see the baking area very clean. This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"I was in the area & was looking for some sweets after having lunch.  Stopped in real quick to see what they had.  It's a bakery obviously, so it smelled yummy! Saw they had a good selection of macarons so we bought quite a bit.  I love macarons & I always have to try them when I come across them.  For $1.20??? Uh... I bought a little more than I should've. lol. That's actually pretty cheap compared to some places I've been to.  Quality of them?? Actually, not too bad.  I like the outside a little chewy. Not a fan of it if it just crumbles too much when you take that first bite. So... these met my expectations.  The other pastries looked good too but didn't get any during our visit.  This might have to be my go-to place for my macaron cravings tho."}
{"text":"This place just changed my work day/life!! The apple turnover is EVERYTHING I would give it 5 stars but I just went there for the 1st time...20mins ago"}
{"text":"I felt like being a Paris for one day and just carbing up. I just have to say is that bread is my weakness. Its so much, that I get weak in the knees LOL If you get any of their sandwiches with their freshly made baguette, you cannot go wrong.

The almond croissant and plain jane croissant were also bomb.

The coffee I didn't really care for. It did not satisfy my coffee craving.

Overall its a cool little spot if you need to change your taste palette."}
{"text":"Waste of time!! The man at the counter must not friendly and should be fired!!! Very very rude"}
{"text":"Perfect traditional \"Galette des rois\" !!! 
It was like back home and a really enjoyable moment with friends !"}
{"text":"Best food we had all week in vegas. Quiche chicken and salmon - very tasty. Ham and cheese sandwich - awesomely good. Great right down to the croutons on the salad. Desserts are melt in your mouth delicious. French coffee was perfect. When we come back to vegas this is the one place we will visit again.  Did I mention the prices are very reasonable?"}
{"text":"Not recommended. Tried to order the bakery  and coffee. The person at the counter not considerate with your time. Under staffed. You need to have more staff to take order at least"}
{"text":"This little jewel was much better than I anticipated. Good coffee and a wonderful chocolate muffin. I came in around 3:30 in the afternoon and the muffin was still soft and fresh. Next time I'm going to have to try one of the cheesecake slices, they look really great."}
{"text":"This is a great great French bakery and Cafe in a much needed area of town. The coffee, sandwiches and pastry are very good. This place is definitely worth the drive or if your in the area and must try."}
{"text":"Parfait ! Accueil chaleureux de la part de toute l'équipe, en anglais comme en français. 
Viennoiseries, sandwichs et salades sont délicieux !"}
{"text":"This little cafe is absolutely great. Very authentic European flavors, none of the icky sticky salty too sweet pastries that unfortunately abound in many coffee house or breakfast cafes. I love the freshly baked bread, also. The prices are extremely reasonable for the high quality of ingredients. If it's a splurge day for you, GO! Eat a beautiful, flaky, sweet, delicate pastry. They have an abundance to choose from, so take two at least!"}
{"text":"They definitely serve a 5 star. Pastries are amazing, coffee bean is ok, service is very good and staff are friendly. Cafe is really clean. Wish they would put their beautiful espresso machine more out front. Too awesome to hide toward the back of the kitchen. Get a good French or Italian bean only and rock that machine up front, the centerpiece ;))) in my opinion. For sure coming back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this new French bakery for an after lunch sweet something.  I had the choclate chip pecan cookie and the chocolate twist.  I loved every bite of them. I will return to try something else."}
{"text":"Sure, we will come back! We had a quiche and crape. They are beyond my expectation!  We liked the both. I would like to try dessert crape next time.     By the way, staff was not nice or friendly, it was rather impolite.  I think kitchen staff helps while unavailable."}
{"text":"What a find! Calling all residents of Old Vegas (Rancho, Alta, Oakey, Valley View and Sahara): this bakery is scrumptious and deserves our support. Friendly and accommodating owners, delicious merchandise. Innovative. Caring. Listening. Authentic French. So happy this is on my doorstep."}
{"text":"I just had a cherry danish it was delicious the bread was soft and peets coffee was good too nice little place and cheap would definitely stop by again"}
{"text":"Really enjoy our brunch!!!  Another great French bakery- very fresh.  Great selection.  Croissants is very flaky- compare to Cafe Breitz. Their crepe is delicious and big.  Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"They've barely been open three weeks, and I've already been by as many times. Vegas has been seeing a surge of bakeries and coffee shops, but this one is close to my home, has a full food menu AND coffee (everything done well), and great service.

Visit #1: A latte and a chocolate-raspberry cake/pie thing? The dark chocolate and perfectly-ripe berries atop a firm crust was the highlight of my day!

Visit #2: Popped in for a solo brunch, under $10 for a small salad (love the slightly-spicy house Dijon dressing!) and a ratatouille quiche that was surprisingly filling, with a light crust of cheese on top.

Visit #3: Grabbed a sandwich to go, then hurried back to work. Heavenly bread, plenty of toppings, simple but fresh. I swear I got back to business in a better mood, thanks to the great meal.

Whatever the opposite of three-strikes-and-you're-out is (three swings and a run?), this place has quickly established a great standard for quality and service. I'll continue to drive past several other spots to come back here!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful and tasty! Very very good!!!! Never been here before, will definitely be back again. Large selection of bread and pastries, also a decent cafe menu if you're looking for food."}
{"text":"The crepes here are scrumptious! Both savory & sweet. Haven't sampled the many other delicacies  I see here yet, but I'm working on it!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for morning coffee. My eyes were darted towards all the pastries and bread as I enter the front door.
I couldn't help myself looking through the glass display at all the croissants, pastries, macaroons, quiches and cakes.
Coffee was great and the chocolate croissant and almond pastries takes you to France literally!
We each ordered an assortment of pastries to take home with us. It did not disappoint. The baguette was just perfect with some cheeses, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.
The good news is that I don't live close by bakery  or I suspect a thicker waist line!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Great food. Bread is soft and crunchy at the same time. Capuchino was delicious. I'm definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This place is great. The only thing that would make this place better is if they played music. I ordered the parisien sandwich, delicious!! The bread was so fresh! The French onion soup is very tasty as well, fresh thyme and lots of flavor! They also serve organic tea, which is always a good sign in my book"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and when I was in Las Vegas recently I decided to give it a try. I ordered the banana crepe with chocolate and whipped cream and a cafe au lait. My friend ordered a lemon crepe with coffee and we shared a almond croissant. We both loved it. It was very fresh. The bakery was very clean and we didn't wait long. I will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"We had our second visit here today. The food is amazing and very consistent. I've had the quiche florentine, the croquet madam, the smoked salmon sandwich, the Normandy(turkey&apples&onions) so good! Today I tried the tuna quiche, by far the most delicious quiche I've ever tasted. The sandwiches and quiche come with a small side salad with a very tasty dressing. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Service was respectful and prompt. Gabriella was attentive and efficient. I needed assistance to help me order since I haven't eaten many of the dishes before.

I ordered the CROQUE MONSIEUR. A sandwich of Swiss cheese, bechamel sauce, and ham, served on a brioche with a side salad. A truly great lunch with iced tea. Everything was fresh and delicious. And the restaurant was clean! A hidden gem! Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"A true french bakery. Everything we had was amazing. We stopped here on our way out of Vegas and on our way to Valley of Fire to go cycling. We grabbed some coffee and a couple of treats and browsed the cases. We ended up getting a good sized box of goodies to go to eat after our big ride that day. 

The favorite was hands down the cheese danishes. Just wow. Might be the best cheese danishes I've ever experienced. Everything about them was just perfect and the flavor was really nice.

Great service, easy parking and a fun little bakery to visit. The only thing we had trouble with was using the Wifi. Three of us couldn't seem to get it to work on any of our devices - iPhones and Macbooks. Oh well, we were there for treats!

If you're in the area and considering Starbucks or something else, just do yourself a favor and go to Delices. You'll be happy you did.

Definitely a must stop at next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Heaven help me for ever finding this place!!  This was my first time here as I found this on the \"Eater\" website and decided to give it a try. Oh my......

As I was standing in line, I had mentioned to another customer that I was really excited to try some of the items and she said she drove by this place a couple of weeks ago and saw \"French Bakery\" on the sign and decided to try it and she has been back 8 times since\"!!!! She told me to leave now or I will be addicted.  She was right. I loved it and plan on going back many more times.   Had the Paris Crepe and it reminded me of a lighter version of Croque Madame. Bought a box of 6 pastry items to go and plan on eating each and every one of them, okay I \"may\" share with my husband, not sure yet.  

So if you are a visitor to Las Vegas, it is not that far off the strip, you can hop in a Lyft to get here. Well worth it. The prices are very fair."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic French Bakery and a great place to brush up on your high school French. The pastries and coffee are fantastic. There is even outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I love this bakery.  We've been going every other weekend or so since we found it.  The breakfast pastries are amazing.  I always get the Roller Balls. Mmm mm.  They don't heat the quiche, they give it to you cold when you order it which we didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place!One of the best French bakeries in town.The food is great-always fresh and tasty ,nice an friendly service ,very cute and cozy interior..."}
{"text":"Amazing, food and service is perfect. Is a must must go. Don't miss it. More place like this should be open."}
{"text":"I had a simple tuna sandwich. The bread was (as expected )outstanding. The surprise was just how great the rest of sandwich was. Sliced egg, sweet pickles, tomato, all tasty and perfect. Will be back next time I visit."}
{"text":"The food, and breakfast was good but the service was very poor. The server did not bring us napkins, ketchup, etc. I guess this place is better with these pastries."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery with yummy teas. 
My friend and I had some quiches, I had the florentine and it was so full of flavor. The mushrooms were so good! My friend had the one with ham and she loved it. That side salad it came with was not good though. The dressing was very pungent and not pleasant to the tastebuds. We had a few of their pastries as well, the one drenched in simple syrup was way too sweet. Lemon tart was good and the almond croissant was under baked. My friend took home some other pastries and a loaf of their bread. The location is loaded with bums. But the bakery itself is cute, just a bad location. I suggest taking their goodies to go. Really wanted to try their pistachio roll but they were out."}
{"text":"Greatest ever almond croissant I have ever eaten!!The pastries are amazing and delicious!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I missed my exit on the 15 fwy and found this hidden gem behind the carwash. Delicious baked goods and the coffee is good as well. Best thing is that it is close to my office! Yay!  Too bad that I drop my latte at the parking lot before I can finish it.. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Okay driving up to the location (corner of valley view and Sahara) you think - NO WAY! How can there be beautiful French pastries residing  anywhere here. This is a case of you can't judge a book by its cover. Had the almond pastry (in pic) and it was soooooo good. Just the right crispy/ flaky outside and light texture inside with a hint of the almond paste. The raisin pastry was not my fav. I order this every time I visit a French pastry shop and it was heavy and not delicate ( amazing at the baguette cafe). Don't go here for the ambiance - they have a huge selection so I'm sure there are more good options."}
{"text":"I work close by and try to come here once a week for lunch. The staff is always so nice and pleasant.   My go to meal is the Florentine Quiche, its so good and just enough to hold me over until dinner time.  I would give this place a 5 star review but the only complaint I have is about the side salad that comes with the quiche.  The dressing is delicious, but the lettuce always looks like its on its last life."}
{"text":"3 stars for the apple turn over.

The review is just for the pastries.
Not bad for US made pastries and especially for Vegas standards.
I was about to give 4 stars for the apple turn over ( it tasted almost like the ones you can have in France) but for whatever reason the next day it tasted different ( like a US one).

-the chocolate croissant: not bad but the chocolate is too sweet.

-the brioche -Nutella was pretty dry and very little chocolate.

-the raisin croissant , I didn't like it, different from the real French recipe.

The staff isn't really nice, except the lady, she's professional and helpful. but the guys are obviously annoyed. I'm not complaining about Vegas service, having lived there I know the deal..., rudeness is the norm. That's another topic...

Nice French music though."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything looks and tastes amazing. The cold sandwiches are great and the salmon is delicious. The variety of the pasties is excellent and I totally see myself coming back much more."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town for pastries and straight up bread. Croissants are crusty and airy, almond croissants are amazing. Pain au chocolate are the best I ever had! I come here way too often, it's the reason I can't lose weight"}
{"text":"I had been to this bakery several times, but never early in the morning.  Let me tell you, the earlier you get here, the better!

On previous visits, which were mostly late afternoon, they only had a limited selection of pastries.  This time I showed up around 9:30 on a Friday, and there were so many more wonderful pastries to choose from.

My #1 favorite here is their Almond Croissants ($3.90).  I can not begin to tell you how much I love those things.  Almond Croissants aren't even my thing.  Other than this place, I never order them.  The only reason why I tried them here is because, on my second visit last summer, the guy behind the counter practically insisted that I needed to.  So glad I listened to that cat.  One of the best pastries I've ever had in my whole damn life!  Spectacularly good!

I'm also all about the pistachio rolls.  So good!

When I was paying for my almond croissants, another customer strongly advised me to check out the bread here.  The woman had a French accent.  French people don't play when it comes to bread or wine.  They know their sh$T.  I took the woman's advice and brought home a nice crusty baguette.

Sliced up the baguette and made a nice little charcuterie platter.  Really wonderful bread!  And it's not expensive.  I don't recall exactly, but it's like $1.79 or something for a baguette.  Whatever it is exactly, it's worth it.

Mikey C says:  Liberté, égalité, fraternité, baby!"}
{"text":"I got the salmon sand which. The French bread was really fresh and yummy. Sand which was too large for me to eat myself, so I get to take a snack home :) will be coming back to try deserts another day."}
{"text":"Excellent! My chocolate croissant was perfect. I can't want to try the savory items on their menu. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think I could move to Las Vegas and Delices Gourmands is one reason why.  They have great french pastries and the best coffee in the city.  Truly a gem.  Also, no tourists (yet...). Come here at breakfast, sit at the counter at the window, look at the sun rising, sip espresso and take a bite of a croissant and smile."}
{"text":"Incredible quality (you have to try the Cheesecake, best I've tried ever) and very very kind workers. After going 2 days in a row asking for carrot cake without they having, they gave me a piece for free once they got! Huge pastries variety. 200% recommendable. I'd give them more stars if I could."}
{"text":"The crepes, omelet, eclair, and danish my wife and I ate here were fantastic. We will be coming back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite morning coffee and pastry stops in the morning. Amazing service, coffee and food! 

Crepes are a must try and the parfait is one of the best I have ever had- light and fluffy! The croissants are melt in you mouth delicious!!!"}
{"text":"So many yummy desserts. I had 4 of the macaroons. She has about 8-12 flavors. I like the fact the it's open and you can see the kitchen. Nice and clean. Everything was freshly made."}
{"text":"Great pastries, delicious and savory! Definitely recommend trying the Strawberry Tart and Chocolate Eclair."}
{"text":"Oh, YES!
Just walking in you know you are in for a treat.  It smells wonderful.
I went for the first time yesterday to browse but ended up getting croissants and some pastry. They were wonderful!
This is what a croissant is supposed to be. Lots of layers, flaky crust and tender inside with the layers.
And if you are looking for pastry that has the flaky, layered consistency with just the right amount of filling instead of the bread-y type normally found here in Vegas, this is it!
Make these guys successful so they stick around!"}
{"text":"A little slice of French charm. I'm sitting before a table of authentic delights, light traditional music is almost covering all of the French being spoken in the bakery. This place is a find."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Good portions overall with a nice selection for lunch consisting of french onion soup, cold or hot sandwiches, and crepes.  Quality is great, and the bread and pastries are fresh and authentic.  The place is a little expensive but a nice touch to the area that caters more towards fast food than local cuisine.  Expect service to be a little slow as there aren't many people working there.  Give it a try.  I really hope people find out about this restaurant and come support it, especially if working or living in the area."}
{"text":"Love this French bakery! Great pistachio roll, almond croissant, danishes, ok I'm a pastry lover and don't discriminate. But they make really good pastries! I also love the mozzarella, tomato and pesto panini. 

This last visit I tried the French onion soup. It was a very generous portion with lots of bread and cheese. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall place is really cute we ordered a couple of things my absolute favorite was the swan dessert i could eat it a million times.  We also ordered this cute pink cake which was a big macaroon type cake really cool. And a type of alcohol cake."}
{"text":"Located in an old strip mall at the corner of Sahara and Valley View, this place is fairly large, with much of their space dedicated to the production of their pastries. Their display cases are fairly extensive, offering a wide variety of items. There are several tables available and on the Saturday I stopped by the place was swarming with people.

Their almond croissant was decent. A better option was their apple danish with its buttery pastry, sweet apples, and icing and slivered almonds on top. Their cheesecake was particularly good, as well. Simply decorated with a bit of chocolate and whipped cream, it was surprisingly airy and light, while also creamy and smooth.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. When it comes to pastries it's hard to choose because they have a good variety of choices and all that I have had were pretty good. On the menu for the breakfast choices they offer about 7 different types of quiches and they also serve omelets as well sweet and savory crepes. For lunch options they offer soup, salads and both hot and cold sandwiches. They use Peets Coffee and Tea and the large White Chocolate Mocha I had was fairly priced under $4 and tasted good. Drinks can be made hot or iced. They offer catering and take orders for specialty cakes for many occasions. They are open until 6 pm Mon - Sat and close at 4 pm on Sunday."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall where you least expect an authentic French bakery to be, its nice to see a true Parisian experience here in Vegas. The baked bread is the best you'll find in town. The croissants and pastries are exactly the right look and taste. And their quiche Florentine is the bomb. We'll be back regularly. Nice atmosphere, very laid back. And the coffee is actually good.

Tips: 
- The Pistacchio bread is ridiculous!!!
- Pate sandwich is excellent, ask them to butter the bread for perfection"}
{"text":"Great bakery!!Very friendly and all fresh items.Family owned business.The location is different but do not that deter you.I highly recommend checking Delices Gourmands out.You will definitely enjoy their pastries"}
{"text":"So in love with this place food is yum the service was ok tho, but food... amazing, affordable and fresh"}
{"text":"Great little find. Wondered in there while my work truck was being washed at Terrible's. Almost walked into the pizza place next door but Delices was much more inviting. I ordered the salmon crepe and a coffee, the coffee came out first and it was outstanding. The sitting room is limited but I found a spot on the high top counter by the window we their is a place for me to plug my laptop in and get some work done will I waited. Shortly after the crepe came out, and it was both delicious and filling. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"We live around the corner in Spanish Oaks and we waited impatiently while they remodeled. 
From the very first day it was love love love. First of all the staff is gracious and generous and friendly as can be. We were offered small tastes of many things and we instantly loved the atmosphere.  We immediately found it to be our favorite, and we have gone almost every day since they opened sometimes twice a day sometimes three if we forgot a loaf of bread. 
Then we ordered an iced latte. They use very delicious coffee and the drink was made to perfection. We are both very picky about our iced coffee drinks and this was wonderful.  But why am I talking about a coffee drink in one of the best French bakeries I've ever visited?  The croissant was large and flaky and exactly what you would expect. Their breads are divine. 
They have created sandwiches such as a tuna and boiled egg concoction that has to be seen and eaten to be believed really delicious.  The quiche Lorraine is divine very very rich and they have about seven other varieties including a bacon one that are equally delicious.  Small glaze desserts are great and many times I've taken a box of them to work to share everyone loves them.  They cater to American taste by offering cheese danish and other danishes which are delicious in their creative versions.  I've had most of the crepes on the menu but my favorite is a mushroom one that is made of mushrooms with a delicious gravy and my husband gets sweet ones which are delicious as well.
One of my favorite French foods is onion soup; i've been known to order two bowls of it for lunch at this place.  They make other soups - there is a vegetable purée it is out of this world.  I recommend getting adventurous with your order because everything coming out of the kitchen is wonderful. 
They offer a brownie that rivals any brownie in an American shop, as well as just one cookie which is made of pecans and deep dark chocolate pieces. How wonderful that they only offer one cookie and it's my favorite. 
The kitchen is open clean and spotless and even the chef comes forward sometimes to say hello.
I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is and how it's become something of a second home; I run into neighbors there and meet new people there.  You meet great people and visit with great people in this atmosphere. congratulations!"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery! 
In an odd strip mall, but don't let that dissuade you. The baked goods are all legitimately french and the joint is run by french people....very authentic.
Prices are reasonable, and the selection is significant.

Put your beret on, crank up some Edith Piaf on the headphones, and grab a baguette on the way home. 
I'll be doing that bien sur."}
{"text":"The top memory is having a nice breakfast, reading the paper I brought from the hotel, having a well made latte, and listening to the pastry chef visiting with a friend in French. It transports me out of Las Vegas and to a favorite cafe in St-Germain, Paris.
The pain au chocolat has perfect chocolate throughout it, and the pastry just melts in the mouth after the crispy bite. Just saying chocolate croissant seems to be too prosaic. It's the best palmier ever, and finally, the canelé -- perfection.
A canelé is supposed to be so heavily caramelized so as to be skirting with going black. It will taste like caramel and molasses on the outside. The inside will be airy and cake like. It is heaven in two small bites. That is if you get a proper one. I've almost never had one like that in the US. I was so looking forward to another one on our second trip, and they didn't have any. As our dear leader says -- Sad.
The second day we went with cooked food, along with pastries. My wife says it's the best omelette she's ever had. It was more in the French style.
Finally, the coffee. The coffee was excellent both days. It wasn't bitter, or sour. The drinks were properly made. However, on our first visit the barista had more skill, and it wasn't just that the latte art was better (it was), the coffee was better. That's the problem with real espresso drinks (no whipped cream or flavorings wanted) is that the flavor is in the quality of the barista. So, good both times, but the only inconsistency we found."}
{"text":"Wow! A real French bakery! They even have incredible quiche! Impressive selection too. Definitely will be back. Very impressed. This quiche is unreal!"}
{"text":"i got the french bagette today. it is probably 2 feet long & only cost $2.10 i believe. it's perfect & authentic, 100 x better than supermarket bread. i also highly recommend the large square pastry with chocolate & pecans in the middle on top (only cost $2.70) which i got the last time i went here."}
{"text":"My expectations were too high. 

One morning I the thought of a savory crepe wouldn't leave me alone! So I decided to go a hunt for this craving. 
Me and my girls ordered one each they a Nutella crepe and I a tuna crepe (which is not on the menu) so sorry to say I was not impressed at all. The crepe were average which was very disappointing. I deduced to give the pastries a try.... mmmm... sorry but the macaroons tasted like they had been seating in the fridge for a while! 

I felt like I spend $40 dollars very poorly that morning. I don't think I'll be coming back. Price is too high and taste was too average 

Ps the guy in the front was very kind and accommodating"}
{"text":"I love this little gem of a place...So many vegetarian friendly options, by far the best coffee in town....Oh and don't forget the yummy pastries, always hard to just pick a few!"}
{"text":"My new favorite French Bakery that serves great breakfasts too!
The desserts are on par with Gay Paris! The bread  is killer! Stop in and have a cappuccino and a napoleon!"}
{"text":"OMG!! My new most favorite bakery ever!! It was like walking into a cafe in Europe!!  Can I say Pastry Pastry Pastry!!  So many deliciousness to choose from!  I am in heaven!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot!  These are the items we tried:  ham and cheese sandwich - the bread was crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside.  Croissants - light and flaky -yumm. veggie omelet meal - more than satisfying.  Ohh tiramisu is heaven.  salmon quiche -outstanding.  We just can't get enough of this place.  Staff was very nice and friendly too.  We're impressed."}
{"text":"We love this place! The desserts are awesome. The onion soup and the quiche are my favorite."}
{"text":"Loved it. I ate there with my family. Croque Madame were perfect. Cherry cheesecake was also great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very rude & unhelpful staff. Also very limited pastries... there was maybe 5 varieties of croissants . Would never stop again was not much in this place that was appealing from the moment you walk in."}
{"text":"Best bakery in Las Vegas! Love the sandwiches with their delicious fresh bread! My favorite is the Tuna Sandwich! The crepes are so good too! Trust me, you definitely wanna go check it out and see it for yourself."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is fantastic. I've been to a few French bakery/café type places and this one is by far my favorite. Coffee is great, and awesome fresh pastries and bread. Had several sandwiches on soft and crunchy baguettes. I think my favorites are the Pate and just the classic ham and cheese. So good. I've also tried a crepe with mushrooms and it was really good. I haven't had anything there that wasn't top notch. Prices are great and so is the service. One of my regular spots."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this bakery on a fairly regular basis and have never been disappointed. When our original wedding plans were canceled with only a week to figure out new ones, we turned to Catherine and her team to perform some dessert magic! The cake and small desserts were delicious and a favorite of our guests."}
{"text":"Tasty pastries and fresh breads! They are French! 

What
Actually went here a couple of times. When I am in Las Vegas for tradeshows, my coworker and I like to go here to pick up quick sandwiches and ofcourse a couple of pastries that we never finish.. The pastries are always tasty, I always pick up different kinds to try everything! Also got the regular ham and cheese sandwich before. The bread is fresh and delicious. To me, it's a bit chewy! My jaw hurts after, but I still finished the sandwich! 

Environment 
The location is in an open plaza. There are a couple of out door seating. Seating can eat limited. It looks big, you can see what goes on behind the scenes. 

Niceness
The ladies there are all so nice. They are patient to explain anything you want to knows whether you want to know what a certain pastry is made of or what she recommends.

Dollar
Reasonable. On a day when you work at the convention center and want to have a sandwich not from a chain. Or whether you just want to pick up pastries. 

Yes?
I would recommend this to someone that likes sandwiches. It may not be a grande meal or something overly special. Simple sandwich with tasty pastries! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing macaroons! Perfect texture great flavor! And made fresh everyday.  Super nice people and I can't wait to try everything!!"}
{"text":"First of all, great service. Second of all, delicious and authentic French treats. We got canapés, almond croissant, and chocolate croissants. So buttery and delicious. Who knew you could find such a place off the strip?"}
{"text":"Having lived in France six years in the 90s, I'm curious about everything French. So when I heard there was a new French bakery in town, I had to try it. The place had the feel -and most likely is- a wholesale operation, but still the atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant, and the staff very friendly. The selection of breads looked the par, but my years of authentic French bread experience made me a discriminating eater: the chocolate twist was good, the raisin roll not so much: too soggy, not crispy enough from outside. Still a credible French bakery worth trying."}
{"text":"Best Pastry/Bakery of Las Vegas! Fresh bread, quiches, crêpes, everything is so good!! And the French pastries are absolutely delicious!! I would like eat at this place everyday!! Just excellent!!! And there is a very good atmosphere! I recommend it to you at 100%, for everyday, wedding, baby shower, Christmas, Thanksgiving.. French Bakery is always a good idea :-)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Next time I am in Vegas, I am coming back for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"My regrets? Not ordering more items and/or coming back for more on my previous trip to Vegas. We were in Vegas briefly as a pit spot to pick up our rental car from McCarran Airport. The road trip was destined to send us through various places in Arizona and Utah. Vegas was just a starting/ending point of the trip. I found this place via Yelp because I was eating at a local breakfast joint literally down the street. Scoop up some pastries for the long road trip ahead? Hell yeah, who doesn't get the road munchies while on a long drive.

It was a Thursday morning and the parking lot was as desolate as being inside Blockbuster Video Store during its final downfall (who remembers this?). The store is just two stores west of the CVS and sits facing W Sahara Avenue. Don't look for the name, just look for the big words: \"French BAKERY & CAFÉ.\" It's really not that far from the strip, only a few blocks down from The Palace Station hotel. 

Not to get too boggled down with overbearing specifics, we scooped up a pistachio roll and an apple Danish. The pistachio roll was very subtle. The texture was perfect though. Not too mushy and not hard as a rock. It didn't fall apart; not flaking all over the rental car as I bit into it. It's quite the perfect pairing with a hot caffeinated drink. 

We actually ate the apple Danish the next day. Surprisingly, it still tasted great. Obviously a little sweeter than the pistachio roll. It looked like it should've been overwhelmingly sweet but it wasn't. Again, the texture was still good even though we were eating it the next day. It held up just fine 24 hours later.

As stated, my only regret was that we didn't pick up more goodies from this place when we got back into Vegas. They have plenty more to offer. Some good looking croissants, pastries, breads, and a few French entrées. I will definitely come back to check out the other items when I'm back in Sin City.

A solid find. Thanks Yelpers."}
{"text":"Ok I wanted to love the bakery but it failed!! I only tried there bakery products and not breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Tried the sugar brioche and chocolate eclair. The chocolate eclair is jam packed with chocolate. The sugar brioche is delicious !"}
{"text":"A great find! Tucked away and understated! Photographable, delicious food! We had a savory crepe and breakfast sandwich; the coffee (Peet's) was also quite good.
Some may draw comparisons to Manon on West Charleston. While there are is not a wide visible selection of cakes, the pastries abound (my guess is that many cake type desserts are made to order). The variety is huge!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend, we decided to have a late breakfast at Delices Gourmands French Bakery. Boy what a delight that was. Everything about this place was on point! Coffee, bold & strong. Pastries were authentic and the crepes took me back to those bistro cafes in France and Italy. 

We ordered from the savory crepes selection which were the Paris and the Montmartre. The Paris crepe consisted of ham, Monterey Jack cheese topped with a fried egg. Delicious! The Montmartre consisted of spinach, goat cheese, chicken, béchamel, onion and Monterey Jack cheese. Good but a little too rich for my liking. 

 We also got a couple of pastries to accompany our coffee. I have a weakness for almond croissants and these were fantastic! Flaky, buttery with almond cream goodness inside. We also ordered the cranberry scones and they were very good. 

I enjoy Bonjour Bakery, but Delices Gourmands offer a bigger variety of Parisian baked goods and pastries. I recommend Delices Gourmands. Oh and naturally they have baguettes and quiches."}
{"text":"Best in the city I would say. This place manufactures for many hotels on the strip. It shows."}
{"text":"Amazing eggs Benedict and French toast!!!!! All pastries look so delicious! I would move to Vegas just for this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this recently opened bakery on our vacation.  She selected a cheese Danish while chose a pistachio roll.  We also shared a pistachio financier.  Both the Danish and pistachio roll were very good and reasonably priced, but our first ever financier proved to be, at best, just fair.  The size of the bakery operation and number of workers appears much larger than could be supported by the walk-in business alone so I would hazard a guess that a wholesale operation is either in the embryonic stage or being contemplated.

Update:  A local reviewer reported that this bakery is making the brioche rolls for Eggslut that recently opened in the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Decent pastries, slow service,  below average ambiance.  Nothing more to say.  Drove from the strip because of yelp. Yelp fail."}
{"text":"The French Onion Soup is very refreshing.  The soup doesn't have the overwhelming saltines as other places do, the sweetness from the onion is well blended into the soup.  The cheese on the top is soft and juicy and the baguette in the soup still remain its shape after dipping in the soup for some time.  We also ordered the omelette and quiche and both are very good.  Pricing is very reasonable and the wait staff are friendly.  We will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I happen to look for a quick breakfast place while waiting for my husband. This popped in on my search and went to try it since it was close by. It's located in a shopping complex that I don't think I would go in to. I drove around to see if it was safe and decided to go in. 

I walked in and there was two employees talking, I was not greeted so I said my greetings. The place looks clean and the kitchen is open. You can see the bakers in action.

I ordered a cup of coffee and almond croissant. I was impressed and finished the whole thing. I have tried a few French pastry around town and by far this is now my favorite place.

I ended up getting a few more items to take home so my family can taste it. I asked the guy at the counter how long they've been open, and It's only been a little over three months. 

Definitely a must try, if your looking for good quality pastries."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, amazing omelette and eggs Benedict for breakfast! What a new hidden gem in Las Vegas. And now I'm heading home with a fresh sourdough baguette and about seven different pastries that I'm so excited to try.  Affordable Authentic French deliciousness in an unpretentious place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best French bakery in Vegas!  Can't get enough of their almond chocolate croissants and pistachio pastries!  Definitely my new breakfast spot and would highly recommend coming here to enjoy a pastry or 5!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem quite by accident while we were lost. Next time you're in Vegas and look g for authentic French cafe with Croque Madame and pasteries make the detour and stop by. It may not look like much on the outside but the goodies inside and worth it!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this bakery.  The caneles and macarons were good and priced reasonably.  The other desserts looked yummy.

However, we ordered a bacon panini and a smoked salmon sandwich to eat in there  before heading back to LA.  We both thought the sandwiches could have been better, as they really skimped on the bacon and the salmon.  The lettuce in my side salad was wilted.  We also ordered coffee, however no refills were offered.

I'll go back the next time I'm in Vegas, but will probably try the crepes instead of the sandwiches.

Rounding up my 3-1/2 stars to a 4 for now."}
{"text":"déjeuner

I spy out the corner of my eye this French bakery & coffee shop while getting a car wash this morning! Starbucks doesn't compare to an authentic croissant so of course I had to check it out!

My croissant was soft, flaky, fresh and delicious!!
I ordered one coconut macaroon; pretty sweet and delicious. I completed my ordered with a slice of tiramisu as well. The tiramisu was prepared well! I'm use to overly moist or dry cake and this was not the case at all!!! I'd definitely return in the near future.

The service was prompt but the employees are not social at all!

$7+ dollars I'm certain I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Great little authentic Neighborhood French Bakery. Also serves hot and cold sandwiches and breakfast specialties. Great coffees, pastries, and breads."}
{"text":"Amazing! Having been to the Beautiful Paris on many an occasion I can attest to their genuine flavor and demeanor - food and service both blow any American Parisian imitation out of the water!"}
{"text":"Great but docked stars for an employee. 
The man running the cash register was not friendly & didn't know the pastries when I requested by photos, and while enjoying our food my bf pointed out that he had been wearing the same gloves since we walked in, using the register, handling money, putting together pastries and cleaning the floors.  Baba au rhum and pistachio roll were amazing. Almond croissant & pistachio bread were pretty hard & wouldn't order again, but we did come at 5pm. The chicken crepe was great too!"}

Opened for approximately one month, and gathering some positive word of mouth from persons often in-the-know, it was just past 10am on Friday that the pink and green sign demarcating \"French Bakery & Café\" was located, the corner of Valley View and Sahara certainly no 'culinary destination'...the same to be said of Delices Gourmands.

Reportedly owned by the former team behind La Belle Terre, \"they use low quality ingredients\" quoted from one local Chef, *though not the one with whom I dined*, Delices Gourmands occupies an enormous footprint within a random Strip Mall and offering several housemade breads alongside sandwiches, quiches and pastries the goods are all nicely presented and average priced, both important to note as management admits the Bakery to be ramping up as a production facility soon.

Well trafficked for a new place, a total of eight parties coming and going over the course of an hour, perusal of Delices Gourmands goods shows several puzzling inconsistencies in labeling as well as ingredients, the 'crescent' in place of Croissant amongst the most obvious though the accented server also seemed clueless when reference was made to a Mille-Feuille she could only call a Napoleon, similar blank stares meeting the request for a Blueberry Clafoutis that she insisted to be a Strawberry Tart.

Eventually selecting fifteen items, the total charge pennies shy of $40 when accounting for tax and tip, tasting began with a twice-baked Almond Croissant that avoided the mistake of too much sweetness but fell short in terms of shatter, the effort still more admirable than a butter version that was almost completely flaccid, the quality only a notch above that of a New York Street Cart.

Disgusted by a canele that ate no different than a gumdrop, the fact apparent even behind glass as the center is puckered while the outside comes across medium yellow instead of browned, Financiers quickly right the ship with great texture and richness whether Pistachio or Natural, the Kouign Amann well caramelized and buttery but falling short of CRAFTkitchen or Bouchon while the Pistachio Snail was another fine choice, though still lacking in terms of lamination.

Executing cookies well, both a jammy Linzer and bitter-sweet Chocolate-Walnut round meeting standards of French bakeries on both sides of the Atlantic, Palmiers come across as a bit drier than several found elsewhere, though it was also less sugary - perhaps merely a different style considering regional variations across France and the Basque, but not particularly memorable just the same.

Moving on to the cold case, a brownie saved for later actually the best thing sampled at Delices Gourmands with a light crunch on the outside and fudgy interior studded with nuts, Carrot Cake was decidedly pedestrian with frosting too-sweet to be described as cream cheese, the 'Napoleon' an unmitigated disaster that smooshed under fork pressure with the layers already soggy despite theoretically being stacked just earlier that day.

Rounding out the morning with a crusted clafoutis that was a bit more firmly set than most yet still satisfying as a result of so much fruit, the Baba au Rhum proved a fortuitous offering considering the Chef I was dining with has been toying with the idea of putting one on his menu, the flavor \"Americanized\" due to a high simple syrup-to-rum ratio though the body was moist and toothsome beneath a dollop of cream that was unfortunately pasty and low-grade.

** Having recently seen the local pastry scene upgraded by Rosallie, Mothership, CRAFTkitchen, PublicUS and Kitchen Table there is simply too much great baking going on throughout the valley to seek out instead of 'settling' for something made to be scalable that is merely 'okay.'"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast, lunch or just a sweet treat with coffe. Everything its delicious here. Almond Croissant very tasty, I got the  Italian omelet was great if you like pesto of course. Stop by and get something to treat your self."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to Paris and wish you could find pastry in the United States that tastes the same, look no further.  For those that have never been, come enjoy the experience.  Simply fresh, not overly sweet and made with love.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best hidden gem bakery in town! I've been here several times and have tried just about everything, never disappointed. My favorites are the cannele, pistachio roll, and their amazing almond croissants. If you're feel like something more than a pastry, try one of their fresh savory crepes. My go to is the Paris crepe with a fresh dippy egg on top."}
{"text":"Delicious French Bakery!!! Very authentic, coffee was perfect! They close at 6 pm and we showed up at 5:55pm. They were very accommodating and still served us!

Also ordered French Onion Soup to go! She packed the bread & cheese & the soup was homemade!!! Delicious all of it! I just ate it"}

{"text":"I happened to see this charming French bakery as I was getting my car washed across the way and I decided to pop in. I was glad that I did. There are an array of delectable pastries and various gourmet meals. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with ham and it came with a salad for less than six dollars. Next time I will certainly try some of their coffees they looked delicioso!"}
{"text":"This bakery is outstanding! Great pastries and breakfast. Glad we came here and we will return."}

{"text":"Delicious food and affordable. Variety with a pastry or a savory quiche or crepe. The owner was friendly enough to help pronounce my mother's French maiden name which my American family has pronounced incorrectly."}
{"text":"My husband favorite almond croissant! Nice coffee. Always fresh French bakery. Even atmosphere is French not is friendly as Americans cafe shops."}
{"text":"We just \"discovered\" this place not far away from our neighborhood and immediately got hooked! Delicious French pastries, quiches and sandwiches! I am a big fan of French cuisine and I am sure to become their \"regular\" :) The owner lady was kind enough to take her time to speak French to me and it put me immediately in a good mood! The service is fast and the prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to come back."}
