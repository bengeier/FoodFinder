{"text":"Something worth mentioning were the fries. I don't know what it was, but they were sweet and most importantly stayed crispy until the END of the meal. They are generous with the fries, and this is justified because you really can't stop eating them; it was like the fries were deep-fried in oil and sex."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Great Food
- Good Portion
- Good Price

Cons:
- Rather bland decor
- Rather bland service

Conclusion:
What can I say, I do enjoy Portuguese food and so far, this little joint which does not look inviting has the best Portuguese food in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very good. Worth a try! The price is just right and it's plenty of food if you're hungry"}
