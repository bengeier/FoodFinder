{"text":"Party of two, but didn't get noticed until over 20 minutes after we got seated and the food took well over an hour to reach us. The food was good, but not worth the wait or the price tag. The problem is the management - only one waitress worked the entire floor on a weekend evening! She had a couple bussers to help but it wasn't enough. Unless I hear that things have changed, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Came for a quick drink a bite to eat before a movie. Service was painfully slow, especially since the restaurant was maybe 10% full. Food was a notch below average and the price was certainly not a value for the quality and portion size. $15 for a few spoonfulls of curry? This isn't NYC/SF, guys.   I really wanted to like this place but you're better off spending your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ugh. This place is so incompetent, I don't even know where to begin. They mess up orders like George Lucas messes up movies. I wouldn't be surprised if I went here one day and some goddamned blinking Ewok was my server.*  The food is not terrible. It's okay, but there are certainly better Thai places around. The service is slow and it has a certain knack for getting things wrong. The interior is pretty nice, I will give them that.  I would recommend this place only if you're hanging out around Cedar/Lee and you're on the verge of knifing someone if you don't get yourself some Thai food.  *Mental note: Open restaurant that serves authentic Ewok cuisine. Scratch that, Ewok-fusion cuisine. Create a bajillion fake Yelp! accounts. Five-star review that mofo like it's my job (which, btw, it will be). Make $$$$$$$. Laugh a lot."}
{"text":"Absolutely, the best restaurant in Cleveland   Try Crab fry rice here they are using real crab (I think vancouver crab)  I have never had better fry rice than this in my entire life  they also have good tom yam coom?(spicy soup with shrimp)  and try extra spicy pad thai and you will get the world class food here in cleveland"}
{"text":"This isn't a good restaurant. Luckily there are tons of good Thai nearby (Peppermint, Bangkok and High Thai'd). Service is poor, ambience is flat and the food is blander than competitor's dishes. Recent price increases on their relatively small portions wasn't a good touch. Furthermore, my party of only 5 got charged automatic gratuity and they wouldn't split the check so one of us got stuck paying $15 in tips - no one had cash. Even without that experience the place is a 1/5 because of poor food and service."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. The service is horrific. For example, we had to find a waiter after twenty minutes or more of sitting at a table. Their manager could not care about the patrons. Go there at your own risk. If you want to be smart find another place like Lopez down the block or even Wendy's on the corner for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Lemon Grass used to be better, and it's still decent some of the time. Inconsistency is a real issue, particularly with freshness of ingredients. I can't recommend this place anymore but will probably give it the occasional try because it's convenient to the Cedar Lee Theatre."}
{"text":"Below average pad thai, horrible tom kha ghai soup and they gave us the wrong spring rolls. Ty Fun is one thousand times better IMO.  Have not been back even though it's right around the corner. I drive the 15 min to tremont."}
{"text":"Found Lemon Grass open on Memorial Day when many restaurants were closed. We were seated immediately and our server was attentive. The Pad Thai was delicious as was the poached chicken with crisp vegetables. This restaurant can satisfy the palate of both Thai aficionados and healthy eaters. I recommend this restaurant without reservation!"}
{"text":"from what I understand the restaurant used to be a mcdonalds; for as long as this business has been around you'd think the old mcdonalds chairs and decorations still remain.  Service slow; smells of sewer which is prominent outside and then finds it's way into the restaurant via air conitioning."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointing!! Exceptionally rude waiters and manager. Literally within 5 minutes after we sat down family of 4 (2 little children) we were warned that we should leave if my 13 month infant did not behave. We were forced to leave in the freezing -6F from an already empty restaurant. This place should be out of business."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Lemon Grass just a few days ago, and I have to say that I wasn't all that impressed.  My boyfriend, his roommate and I decided to head out for a few drinks and food and we ended up here.  We sat out on the patio, which was really cute and cozy (I actually preferred it to the seating inside - plus it was much quieter outside).  They instantly gravitated towards the drink menu - let's put it this way: after ordering one, they stuck to beer for the duration of the meal.  I had the fool proof, safe vodka soda, which somehow managed to turn out wrong (I'm not really even sure what it was to be honest).    We ordered our food - appetizers were toong tong, which was really just a drier version of crab rangoon and I had the lemon grass soup, which it just their version on tom yum soup.  Well, I would really suggest neither.  The toong tong didn't have any good flavor and my soup was overpowered by the taste of shrimp (if you want good tom yum, head to tree country!).  For entrees the roommate and I both had pad thai, two different versions, that were both very good.  I wasn't blown away, but it was a vast improvement from the appetizers we just ate.  My bf ordered some kind of sampler platter with a summer salad, ribs, and chicken wings.  The meat was good (wings were really crispy and great), but the salad he (and I) could have totally passed on.    I really wanted to give this place 2.5 stars, but the pad thai made up for it ever so slightly, bumping my overall rating to 3.  If you're looking for great Asian food there are PLENTY of other places around here with a better selection at better prices."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful. But everything else is lacking.  The service is incredibly slow, and not attentive. The food is ok, at best. One thing I got excited about is their fresh rolls are done in a style I'm used to (Chicago Thai style). It's a thin crepe with lettuce and tofu inside, with a sweet sauce. But the thing had so much lettuce inside it just tasted watery.   I feel like this restaurant is just going through the motions, an echo of whatever it was when it started. They should really do something different, or give up the excellent location to someone who can knock our socks off. The Cedar Lee area could use something new, and Lemon Grass is definitely the 'old.'"}
{"text":"Poor Thai food.  I had samosas and orange chicken ala Thai style. This food was presented as Thai yet tasted like microwaved frozen food. My wife had the fried rice which was tasteless. (Ironically, Trader Joe's fried rice tastes better).    Very disappointing and I will not go back unless I can go back in the kitchen and watch the preparation by the chef (is there a trained chef at this place??).  This place caters to the local crowd who appears not to demand real Thai, Mexican or Italian foods. If you want authentic cuisine go somewhere else. What a rip off."}
{"text":"This is the first place I ever had thai food. It was quite an experience. The selection of curries and dishes were great. I thought the prices were a little expensive compared to other thai places. However, its does have a decent atmosphere. Its good to go after or before watching a movie at the Cedar-Lee movie threater."}
{"text":"CRAB FRIED RICE!   I considered writing those three words alone as my entire review, but I will elaborate. Everything else is mediocre as described in the other reviews, but I LOVE the crab fried rice. It was a recommendation from their delightfully goofy server, and I have ordered it repeatedly since!"}
{"text":"The food was good, and the waitress was particularly helpful in picking out what food to order. We got Dancing Squid and Drunken Noodles. Both were tasty and it was our first taste of squid! I though the price was a little high though...."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night for the first time in a year or so.  The food was okay but the service was terrible.  Not at all what had experienced in the past.  The server barely said two words to us and was nowhere to be seen if he wasn't delivering food.  No asking if everything was okay, if we wanted more rice,  another drink, etc.  Our bill was incorrect and we got another server to correct it.  I don't know if it wasn't a regular server and just someone filling in, but it was so strange to be so negliected by a server."}
{"text":"A bit more expensive than other restaurants, especially by Cleveland standards.  Food was good, solid Thai food.  The \"winter special\" pork and pumpkin curry was pretty good.  The seafood Cho-Che was ok.    Judging from the other meals I saw, I'll try to stick with the specials here.  I've tried this and Mint.  Lemongrass is better than Mint, but not so much that I wouldn't pay much less at Mint.  Still looking for fabulous Thai in Cleveland.  And looking ........"}
{"text":"Went here once. It was alright. Nothing bad or amazing. Kind of expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Uninspired Thai-fusion. Nothing to complain about, especially, but nothing to write home about either. For the price, much better Thai can be had in Cleveland (try Tremont's Thai Fun!)  Edit: Or, try Thai Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars based on my experience, but I was forced to give a rating.   I have been wanting to eat here for a long time ( at least 5 months). I showed up at Lemon grass today at 4:45 pm and noticed on their sign they do not open for dinner on Fridays until 5pm. So I went to CVS for a few minutes. I came back to Lemon Grass at 4:57pm. The doors were still locked so I yelled at myself for not walking around more at CVS (I didn't need anything there though) and proceeded to look at their menu on my phone. I saw someone working inside but they never came to the door. I continued to wait until 5:03 pm...the doors were still locked. I pulled at each door. Then I noticed a staff member walking near the doors. She appeared to looked at the doors and me waiting outside, but never let me in!! At 10 (feels like -2) degrees outside, I decided this place wasn't worth it. Lemon Grass you lost a single customer today, but one who typically consumes a  lot of expensive food. I will not return to eat based on this. I went down the road to Lopez, who also opened at 5pm but appeared to let their customers in early if they were outside waiting."}
{"text":"Was there on Thursday, July 28, 2011 for lunch.  Had Panang Curry which was not on the menu, but they said, \"Oh yes, we have it.\"  Mediocre at best.  Too sweet and underseasoned.  Asked for it spicy, got it bland.  My friend ordered a crab noodle dish which was supposed to be different than Pad Thai.  He said it tasted too much like Pad Thai and only ate half.  Service was very slow and the place was less than half full.  Don't think this place will last a whole lot longer."}
{"text":"Lemon grass is a restaurant you can bring a date. We shared an appetizer that was very good. Our entree was the vegetarian pad Thai. The service was great but the food came out a little too quick.  The meal came out in under 10 minutes and it was obvious that the tofu had been fried in the morning and then reheated before serving. They had some local Asian beers that were not overly expensive. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and good service but that does not make up for the less than desirable food. Better pad Thai can be found around the corner."}
{"text":"While this place suffices as a Thai food restaurant, I didn't find anything particularly amazing about it. My fiancé got a green curry and I got mango fried rice. The green curry was actually the really good part of the experience. I thought it was pretty delicious and my fiancé liked it enough. It wasn't his favorite of all of the green curries that he seems to have registered in his memory, but it was good. The mango fried rice was certainly lacking something. The pieces of mango were substantial and one of my favorite things about fried rice is the amount of onion in it, so that was good too. But overall, it wasn't packed with flavor and, though I ate a lot more of it than either of us expected me to (I was super hungry, ok?), I would have to say I don't think I'd do this again (order the mango fried rice...or even come here). Everything was just ok and I don't feel a pressing need to come back.  Needless to say, my leftovers didn't end up getting the attention they may have wanted. We even forget about them in the car, then they sat in the fridge for too long."}
{"text":"Why aren't you eating there right now?: Stop what you are doing and immediately go to eat at this delicious, comfortable and relaxing restaurant. It is a great meeting spot before a show at Cedar Lee, or a night of bar hopping along Lee."}
{"text":"Garbage. Meat was older and tougher than old raw hide, appetizers gross.  Left my full plate, untouched and wife did too."}
{"text":"Lemongrass is like a first girlfriend; I was really happy to have her at the time, but as the years have gone by I realize wow, I was WAY too into her.    See, when I first got to Cleveland, Lemongrass was the only Thai place I knew.  And it was right outside the Cedar Lee Theater, so we could see an indie flick and then get Thai food!  How awesome is that?    I was in love.  I told all my friends.    But as time went by, like any relationship, the excitement waned and I started to notice all the little irritations.  Like how much Lemongrass cost - it was spendy for Thai food.  And the fact that the curries really weren't all that flavorful.  And the soups were bland.   Like a bad girlfriend, my friends started to complain.  \"Lemongrass AGAIN?\" they whined.  \"Why does SHE always have to show up after the movie?\"  \"Shut up!\" I cried, putting my hands over my ears.  \"She's awesome!  She's the best Thai food EVAR!\"  Then I listened to Jimmy Eat World and ate my Thai food, crying, in the car.    Eventually, this cute little Thai Hut on the other side of town caught my eye.  \"I'll just have some Massaman,\" I said.  \"To go.  That's not really cheating, is it?\"  But man, that Massaman was everything Lemongrass could never be.    I didn't want to admit it.  We never had a formal breakup - I just saw her less and less.  It was awkward, coming out of the theater; Lemongrass would look me in the eye, and I'd just pretend I didn't see her.    Sometimes, I think, \"Man, I should go to Lemongrass.\"  And sometimes we hook up, and then I come away going, \"Wow, that was too damn expensive and didn't taste all that good.\"  Just like my first girlfriend.  ZING!  (DISCLAIMER: Actually, my first girlfriend was a lot better than Lemongrass.)"}
{"text":"Place was clean, service was quicker than what other yelpers had lead me to believe, but we went late lunch, so not too many people there to fight for service. Got the green curry with tofu...i love this dish, i get it at new Thai restaurants to have something to compare. I give it 4 stars because the taste was good  the quality was good, but i had asked for mild and didn't find it to be true-it was spicier than what i wanted. But, overall, yum!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge, but they have very few clientele and even fewer waitstaff. It takes a really long time to even order your food. Unless you're really not that hungry, you're probably not going to like the service a lot.   The pricing of the food is also a bit high. For far cheaper (and probably a lot tastier), you can get similar options at Mekong River down the street.   I was here a few years ago though and the food was definitely better. I'm disappointed that the quality has decreased. Hopefully they'll bounce back because I'd be sad to see a local business fold."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this restaurant. My friend and I came here for dinner at around 7pm on a Thursday night, and the restaurant was fairly empty. There was only 1 waitress working, and she took over 15 minutes to bring us menus. My friend and I were both very hungry, so we knew what we wanted to get right away. However, it took another 20 minutes for the waitress to come around to take our orders.   I got the duck panang curry, and was very disappointed by the lack of flavor in the curry. There was also too much vegetables and too few duck meat in the dish, so I would not recommend this dish whatsoever. If you're looking for some great Thai food with awesome service, go further down Lee and check out Mekong River!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years and have never been disappointed with their food or service. Their Pad Thai is the best I've ever had from anywhere. I've had this dish from tons of Thai restaurants from different locations in the US (including San Francisco and New York) and none have been as good! Anyone I ever brought here has said the same. Lemon Grass's garlic duck is also amazing - my aunt who is a very picky eater and rarely likes restaurant food raved about this dish - and I definitely recommend getting the mango sticky rice as a dessert after any meal! The only way to describe this dessert is orgasmic! They also have tons of vegetarian options, anyone can find something they like here. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good but fading ... Yellow curry and duck were very good ... Understaffed though ... Our server tried"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a friend on a Saturday night after deciding to explore Lee Rd. I wasn't too impressed with the decor of this place, particularly the tableclothes and the dark orange on the walls. I had the chicken pik king and the beef satay. I felt that both dishes were good, but not near the best satay or coconut-based curry I've had. The food prices here were a bit expensive, but the drinks were quite reasonably priced; we had an excellent bottle of wine for a little over twenty dollars."}
{"text":"At $12- $16 a plate Lemon Grass is kinda expensive for a Thai restaurant and for what you get I don't think it is worth it. We ordered takeout so I can't comment on service or decor. The pad prik? fish dish was served in a sweet, goopy, chinesesk sauce, and not at all what I was expecting.  I appreciate that the pad Thai looks like what pad Thai in Thailand looks like without the gross tamarind sauce that you find all too often in the states, but it was bland and lacked peanuts and sprouts. The bf thought the red curry chicken was also bland, but I thought it was tasty and my favorite of the three dishes."}
{"text":"I came to Lemon Grass to redeem the Groupon I'd bought earlier in the month. The transaction went smoothly and I didn't have any issues regarding that.  I'd never eaten Thai food before but the server went above and beyond the explain the different dishes and recommend things that she thought I might like. The food itself was very good, albeit on the spicy side, but that was pretty much expected.  The prices seemed a bit on the high side, and that's really my only complaint."}
{"text":"Good food just took forever to get our food we were a group of six and it took over an hour to get our food the place was not packed heck it was a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now...and I have to say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!  I have no explanation for why I went back other than, I'm new to Cleveland, I was craving Thai food, and was too lazy to some research and discover a new (good) place.    The Thai food at Lemon Grass is average (3 stars at the most).  I had the Squid stir-fry and the squid was under cooked or overcooked (it was rubbery) and the spice was NOT hitting me like it would at a good Thai place.  Also, the service was subpar, which lowers the whole experience down to two stars.  While I was still enjoying my entree, the waiter ran up to ask us about dessert.  Dang!  Can a lady put her fork down first?  We were too polite to say \"hold up!\" so we went ahead and ordered and do you know they brought out the dessert (melting ice-cream!) before I had even finished my entree?!  Poor showing, chums! SMH.  And then you had the several waiters coming up every 3 seconds to ask us if we would like more water.  Ummm...thanks? I'm glad you don't want me to die of thirst from the last time you checked...three seconds ago!!   It was date night for me and my husband and it would have been nice to continue our conversation uninterrupted, thank you very much.    In short, if you want to have a nice leisurely dinner with plenty of good conversation and maybe authentic spicy Thai food, Lemon Grass is NOT the place for you. Oh, and did I mention this place is overpriced? Fried crab rice was like $15!!?  And it still wasn't better than the one I had in San Francisco for $7."}
{"text":"We were in the area to see a film at the Cedar Lee and had a taste for Asian food and so we gave this place a try.  The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was nice, but the food was just ok.  Unlike the other restaurants on Lee Road, I wouldnt make a special trip to eat here.  I agree with the comments below regarding the spring rolls--too much lettuce and they were a bit watery.  So if you want a basic meal and are in the area to see a movie, then Lemon Grass might be ok, but if you want something special, then head down Lee Road as there are plenty of other choices."}
{"text":"This is mediocre Thai food at jacked-up prices (at least relative to the Cleveland area, where almost all good food is cheap).  It is too expensive relative to what you get.  For better Thai food, go up the road to Mekong River, or if you want a real treat, go to Thai Kitchen on the west side.  The food here was relatively bland and didn't do anything for me.  It seems to be catering to the snootier people amongst the Cedar/Lee crowd, folks who drive in from the suburbs and want to shell out some money for a nice sit-down restaurant but don't really know how to distinguish great food from merely edible food."}
{"text":"Yeah, so metro Cleveland has a Thai restaurant called Lemon Grass.  What city doesn't?  It's about as expected as that local coffee shop that uses some pun with \"bean/joe/java/grounds\" and writes its menu on a chalkboard.  But wait!  The predictability doesn't stop there!  A perfectly adequate curry suffered a certain diminution because the cooks just couldn't deliver on spiciness to add punch to the heavily cooked veggies.  Sorry, but I don't think they can play that \"Midwestern tastes\" card anymore, because Indianapolis has a Thai restaurant on the uber-suburban southside that curled my nose hairs.  I ask for spicy and can certainly expect better than what Lemon Grass had to offer; no doubt other Clevelanders would feel the same way.  At the same time, nothing was bad at all, and the service at this big-for-Thai was really exceptional: super friendly and attentive but never quite approached gushing or fawning.  As we were leaving, they even rushed one last time to send a final farewell--they didn't need to do that, since we had already put the tip down.  Just nice!  Midwest nice!  Now let's pull off \"Midwest spice\" because, seriously, that doesn't have to be an oxymoron."}
{"text":"This place sucks the food and the service went here back in july with a female friend it took 40 minutes to get our food when we got it it was cold my chicken tasted like cold rubber tuff and cold i complained to my server he said sorry but they had  a large party on the other side of the restaurant. So i paid for my food and left i then called back and talked with the manager he was very rude and stated he wasnt going to do anything about the food or service complete moron i hope this place goes under dump"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good but food is expensive for the small portion they serve. It is not exactly authentic as I have been to Thailand many times. We walked away hungry after spending over $60. Would not be back unless I have someone else to pay for it."}
{"text":"This place was pretty dead when I went here. The service seemed a little low energy but extremely friendly. It was a large, clean, and nice looking place, good atmosphere. The pad thai was alright, but it really lacked that old smoky wok flavor that I've grown to love at the cheaper thai restaurants in Seattle. My friend had some spicy green noodles that tasted pretty good. It was a little pricey for my level of satisfaction. I wouldn't decline an invitation to meet someone here again, but I'm more interested in seeing what else is out there."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  They have really good pad thai.  When Mint Cafe on COventry changed owners/went under, I switched to Lemongrass.  They have good curry as well, but not quite as good as Mint was.  The dishes are vary big, worth the price.  The drinks are pretty expensive, but that is not why most people are going there!  Their spring rolls are really good, I have yet to try any soups or other apps however.  Service is usually really good.  One time they accidentally put shrimp in my boyfriend's pad thai, and when he complained, it was fixed in just a few minutes.  Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is amazing! Crab Noodle is a good dish also. Pretty chilled atmosphere and they are always polite. Good prices for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" certainly describes Lemon Grass.  Was longing for Chinese food and ended up finding Lemon Grass.  I know it's thai food, but I figured it would do the trick.  Here's the thing... service is sloooooooow.  Now if you think it will be fine when/if you go, you're probably wrong.  To make the wait for the mediocre thai food even worse, the cd coming through the sound system in the dining area was skipping.  It kept repeating the same 30 seconds of \"Let's go round again\" by Average White Band.  If you haven't heard it, I'll be glad to sing it for you as I am now quite familiar with it.  About 30 minutes after the song kept playing, the rest of the restaurant started to realize the song was repeating as well.  It would've been easier to correct this issue, but the waitress was MIA.  The one positive note from this experience is I now know what I will be choosing for my disco karaoke night.  Okay what about the food you ask?  I started with the lemon grass appetizer sampler (I don't think that's what it was called, but who cares at this point).  It had the spring rolls, shrimp in a blanket, chicken on a skewer and some other kind of fried thing.  It came on a nice platter with 4 sauces.  The waitress put it down and did not explain what the sauces were, as is standard appetizer sampler protocol.    Then came the main dish.  I ordered the pad thai.  Can't go wrong with the pad thai at a thai restaurant.  Should be the staple right!?  It wasn't bad, I was hungry and devoured it, but it was nothing special.  Had a glazy-ness to it's taste.    Overall... service sucks, food is okay.  Do not take the advice of the Average White Band... don't go round again!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now and both times have been disappointed. Cold tea and a cold room did not help!"}
{"text":"I was really hesitant to come to Lemon Grass because of all the reviews I read on Yelp. However, it really isn't that bad of a restaurant... IF and ONLY IF you know what to order so keep reading!  I went for dinner with 3 other friends and we all loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the spaciness. Here's everything we ordered:  Appetizers: Chicken Satay (3 stars) & Shrimp in Blanket (4 stars) The chicken satay was delicious! However, the chicken was a bit too hard for me. The shrimp in the blanket was PERFECT but a bit small and pricey (only reason it's 4 stars)  Entrees: Seafood Jade Noodles (0 star), Drunken Noodles (4 stars), Crab Noodles (5 stars), Chef's Frie Rice (4 stars): First, I didn't try the crab noodles or the chef's fried rice..it's purely on what my friends thought. The drunken noodles flavors were good with a kick to it. To those who are familiar with Chinese food, it tastes like Beef Ho Fun. The seafood jade noodles was disgusting.. it sounded so enticing because it had squid, scallops, and shrimp! But the noodles and seafood had ZERO flavors and it was very watery. I almost feel like they cooked frozen seafood and it \"melted\" while cooking in the noodles and hence the fish was so watery. My friends ordered crab noodles and thought it was AWESOME and had them add chicken (extra $3) to the dish. But yeah, he LOVED it. Then, my other friend had the chef's special fried rice and I think that might be the next dish I tried. She loved it AND it looked soooo delicious and flavorful!  Personally, I would come back here again to try more dishes. It's not my favorite restaurant but I'd love to try again."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for Thai cuisine. The Pad Thai is easily the most authentic I've eaten in the area. The prices are decent, the staff is usually very good and the atmosphere is warm and romantic. If you love authentic Pad Thai, check this place out."}
{"text":"Took the family as we hadn't been in several years and was terribly disappointed! Portions were small, kids didn't eat what they always enjoyed.  I know you are supposed to be hungry an hour later but we left hungry and after a hefty bill!  Had the chili duck as it used to be a favorite and it was nowhere near as good.  Oh well check another off the list!"}
{"text":"I hesitated to come here because they really don't get that many customers.  It's a fairly sizable restaurant with lots of windows and a nice patio, but if only one or two tables are filled, it just feels a bit... eerie.   I finally did come because I got a deal from living social.  Tried the Pad See Ew because High Thai'd does not carry it.  The noodles had a weird texture to them... they tasted a bit soggy, for lack of a better word.  The meat was overdone.  It was passable for the sole reason that we had to drive 30 minutes to Pepper Pike for better Pad See Ew.  The next time, we came for takeout.  They told us 15 minutes - when we got there they made us wait for 20 minutes more.  The restaurant was nearly empty as usual, and while we were waiting we couldn't help but notice that the bartender had his shirt half tucked in.  I know, that's a nitpicky detail, but seriously?  The Pad See Ew was the same - soggy noodles, meat overdone.  That was the last time we've come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and feel that I can write a non bias review. I always think places deserve a second chance.  the first time i went was during the wind storm and the place was dead. there was maybe 2 other tables. Despite that the service was awful, super slow and forgetful. When i asked for the bill, the server gave me the wrong bill TWICE. Finally we decided to just walk up to make sure we got the right one. I got the seared tuna that came with what seemed like pickled garlic. it was pretty good, something i didn't expect to see.  Round 2 Ordered the curry which was delicious. I really enjoyed it and was actually impressed. It wasn't like other curries I've had, it had a different taste to it but I loved it. The portions are a bit too much for one person and not enough for two people. You  must order something else! Appetizer?  Again the service was extremely slow. However, it was a BIT busier than the last time, but i expect better service. The waiter gave us zero time to look over the menu and then when we were ready it seemed like he never came back. Waters never got refilled. just terrible.  I've only been to 3 thai places in the cleveland  area and this is pretty good. but the service is terrible. whats a good dining experience without good service?"}
{"text":"A few days after Thanksgiving, we all needed a change from turkey. What better way to spice things up than to order Thai food?  We placed a gigantic order at Lemon Grass, including Pad Thai, House Fried Rice, Chicken with Pine Nuts, Green Curry Noodles, Panang Curry, Massaman Curry, Chicken Coconut Soup, Beef with Macadamia Nuts, and Pork with Green Noodles.  Everything was ready quickly - we picked up the order after about 20 minutes or so.  I'd say, given the quality of the food, it was overpriced.  Nothing was really especially good.  It was all just standard, but tasty, Thai take out.  Nothing that made us say wow.  I did enjoy the non-curry dishes the most (the fried rice and pad thai especially) - those were a little above average to me.  The curries were all fine....but they all tasted REALLY similar.  That was disappointing.  We really couldn't detect much difference between the three at all.  That was a bit disappointing.  They were so much alike that we mixed the leftovers all together and put them in the same tupperware - no reason to keep them separate.  It's fine, it's fast, and it's pretty much what you'd expect Thai takeout to be.  There might be a few standouts, but overall it's not anything you haven't had before.  I'm sure you could find more authentic and more fresh-tasting Thai food easily."}
{"text":"I've had better at a lot of joins, but that was Los Angeles where Thai people are plentiful. I guess I have to accept that the scale is lower here in cleveland cuz there just arent alot of thai's to open a eatery. Anyway, IMHO over priced for what you get. and what you get is just OK. it wasnt bad but ok is the best I can give em. if you never ventured outside of Ohio I suppose you wont know the difference. If you frequently visit SF, LA or NYC, you wont like this place. Skip on the thai food in cleveland cuz the buz on this place is that its the \"best thai in cleveland\"."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Thai food, and this is definitely my least favorite Thai food in Cleveland. I've tried it 2 or 3 times- primarily for group events. Unfortunately food is bland, portions are average.  I feel like pad thai is always an easy go to dish at any Thai restaurant, but I'd much rather try some of the places on Coventry. The fried appetizers are good...but they are still....Fried appetizers. Anything tastes good fried!  They do have good space for group events and are generally pretty accommodating."}
{"text":"I think this place has had an overhaul in the past few months.  Service is so much better than it has been in the past.  And dishes have changed a bit.  I probably eat here at least twice a month and I have noticed a pick up in the number of patrons as well.  Their portions are generous and the prices are on par with their competitors.  My go to dish used to be their Jade noodles, which WERE phenomenal.  But, the last time I was there, the dish was quite different.  I inquired about it (as the noodles weren't jade green as they usually are) and the server insisted that it was the right dish, and they just changed the brand of noodles.  Maybe they changed chefs.  Certainly the number and the quality of the servers have been upgraded.  But overall, I am a fan and think this is a solid restaurant in the neighborhood. I also consistently buy restaurant.com coupons to use here, which makes it even more of a deal to dine here."}
{"text":"The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the Tom yum soup, a staple of any Thai restaurant and it was literally horrible.  Super salty, lacked any real flavor with the only substance being mushrooms and a few shrimp.  The main dishes were mediocre.  The pad thai was decent and the crab fried rice was good.  The basil chicken and red curry beef were bland.  At the end of the meal, the server goofed up the bill, overcharging us, so beware."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Went here last Friday with two of my co-workers (also fellow foodies) to try out Lemongrass's thai food.  I was curious. Definitely hesitant, but curious to see what thai food would taste like here.  It's a nice restaurant- nice patio, nice location, nice set-up. Yet, our service was ridiculously slow. Way too slow. There were only 2 other groups of two people...yet we kept waiting and waiting and waiting JUST to put our order in.   One of my co-workers ordered a seafood platter dish. It didn't taste very thai.... but he seemed to like it? The friend next to me ordered the duck in some type of curry. The duck was so not cooked right. As duck is one of my favorite dishes to eat, I know a good duck when I taste one..and the duck was dry, overcooked, not good. I, in turn, ordered the green noodle curry...which wasn't really spicy in my opinion...just very mediocre, overall?  I mean, I think this place is better than thai fast food places I've eaten at. But it was....okay.. It's okay for the occasional fix- their menu is huge, so I'm sure there's lots more to try....hopefully. I have my hopes."}
{"text":"I have heard that this place's service is bad and slow, so I was pretty cautious before I decided to come here with a group of friends. Actually, we finished dinner in just a little over an hour and we had 8 people in total in our group. I would definitely say that our service was pretty good - the waiter came check on us very often and always kept our water filled. The food also came pretty quickly, so i was pretty happy with the service.  Food wise, I am going to speak for their vegetarian options, cuz that's also partly what they are known for. I would give it a 3 for the food quality. So we ordered this vegetarian gyoza and it was very yummy. Although the crust was a little thick, the flavor was pretty good. Then I ordered the vegetarian pad thai. It was pretty well made and the portion size was very reasonable too. It costed only $11 so that was not expensive either.  Overall, a great place to go for vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Lemon Grass is my favorite place to have dinner when I'm going to the Cedar Lee, or just over on the East Side in general.   Yes, its menu is pretty much like every other Thai place at first glance. However, one thing that sets it apart is the large quantity of vegetarian entrees, or entrees that can be made vegetarian. My husband actually had a hard time choosing an entree at dinner last night, because there were just so many to choose from, not to mention that more appetizers were vegetarian than not. Four out of 5 times when we go out to eat, his decision is made for him because there is usually only one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu (and it's usually a veggie burger or cheese pizza).   Me being the hypocritical flexitarian that I am, I always indulge in my favorite dish at Lemon Grass when I visit: the Spicy Thai Basil stir-fried duck. It is just phenomenal. My brother and I shared this dish about three years ago (or whenever it was that 500 Days of Summer was playing at the Cedar Lee) and he still talks about the dish to this day.    This duck dish is just delicious, but probably not the healthiest thing on the menu. It reminds me of certain Korean chicken dishes my mom makes, where the fat from the meat melts into the spices and juices of the rest of the dish, and you kind of spoon all of that on top of your rice as a clear fat gravy. It's the best ever.  Also, I appreciate that the duck is deboned as well as it can be (only the bones in the drumsticks remained).  I also really enjoy the fluffy, perfectly-cooked jasmine rice at Lemon Grass.   For dinner last night, we also ordered the basil fried rice with tofu. I think I prefer the same dish at Cuisine du Cambodge simply because I like it to be a little on the spicier side, but my husband scarfed it down, loving it.  Overall, the servers, greeter and bar staff were SUPER friendly here last night. I think we were greeted with an enthusiastic welcoming hello and sent off with a very kind Thank You by every single employee that we passed."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has been in the area for quite some time... I don't know how. The food was not very good but it was expensive. Lotus Thai is just down the street and tastes way better, plus with better service. There is also a Thai restaurant on Coventry which I prefer. It's too bad because the atmosphere and location are fantastic."}
{"text":"I question the authenticity of this place, and who's in the kitchen cooking. Most of the apps are \"deep fried_____ with sweet thai chili sauce\" --gross. So we ordered spicy seafood soup and 2 entrees--chicken green curry and something called sizzling land and sea speciality blah blah. The soup is actually tom yum soup made with frozen seafood. (How do I know? You can see the mercury-like glaze over the shrimp, scallop, and squid.) Green curry should have been called chicken bathed in coconut milk and the land and sea dish was suppose to be served on a hot plate...sizzling at the table. Negative. No sizzles, no fun.  Our server was slow. Prices are too high for the quality. On the plus side, there's a nice patio in the back."}
{"text":"I went on my first official date with my ex-boyfriend here, and while the relationship didn't last, I would still go back.  The Thai and Vietnamese food is pretty good, and the Cedar Lee area is nice to walk around, see a movie, or hang out at one of several pubs.   The Pad Thai is yummy, and you get a choice of how spicy you want it."}
