{"text":"Wow!!! My son talked about the food here and raved about it. It is by far the most amazing 'Mexican Sushi. Called locally Sushi estilo sinaloa. We had 7 different 'rolls'. My favorite was the Sushi-to roll with 3 meats and bacon on top!    They don't have anything like this in salt lake. I am hooked on it."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about ordering sushi from a random house but after talking to Lucy I had to try the fusion food. It was only $8 for my plate and I had to pay cash and there are no menus available online. But the food was awesome I have nothing bad to say about it!  We ordered the guatamalin and the cielomarytierra.  I would recomend them both.  I will be ordering again."}
{"text":"These rolls are delicious! Not pricey at all, so I was able to try many at once. I tried the Guamuchilito which was packed with shrimp, crab meat, cucumber, Philadelphia cheese, and topped with some more crab meat! Each roll was better than the one before the flavors kept coming. The best was the Torito Chiles, wow, spicy crusted chilies filled with Philadelphia Cheese crab meat and love. I Definitely recommend this to all!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! I defiantly recommend coming here. Great food, great prices great everything!!! The family is so nice too!!"}
{"text":"Very intimidating walking into Liquidation Warehouse looking for \"sushi\"...but the family that runs the place is SO nice. The location cannot be easy to keep their business busy so spread the word. It's Sinaloa sushi roles, which are a unique spin on sushi. The little crab salad on the side is super good! I'll definitely be back again!"}
