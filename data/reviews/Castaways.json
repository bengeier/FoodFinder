{"text":"Was okey. I tried the baked chicken dish. Authentic but too cheesy."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise when I looked at the menu for the first time, they have a wide variety of signature pizzas and pastas. I ordered take out and was a little sketched out bc of all the motorcycles in the lot but realized that crowd belongs to the neighboring establishment. The inside is clean and has plenty of tv's. The pizzas were good and very reasonable priced. I had the #16. Ill definitely order there again."}
{"text":"Chad is a great guy. Their food is good. But I'm sorry to be the first to say it: they water down their booze. Simple fact. Went there with a friend to kill time before going to the airport. Wild Turkey, Jim Bean Black, Dickle 8, Jamison, jack....all watered down. How do you think they can afford to give you a shot every time you check in on Facebook? - you're getting 1/2 the booze you pay for. Tip: order everything neat, they've already given you a water back."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Great food...but even better the staff. Erica is the bomb! She rocks this place with her Chicago style. We love when she works. Guaranteed fun!!! Kevin...sold us on the  BEST pizza EVER!!! Yum!!! He always has a great smile. Then there is Boston...funny dry \"wicked\" sense of humor.  GOTTA love him...
Gotta go...yummy pizza is here!!!"}
{"text":"There is so much to say about this place. They get a 5 from me any day. Food is always amazing, drinks are better than expected. \"BOSTON\" #1 bartender/cook ever!!! He is one of a kind when it comes to his customers. Gives great service an over the top drinks an food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Oh an not to mention the happy hour amazing prices. #1 spot in az."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar in Phoenix. Local spot, cheap drinks with a great staff. Boston is awesome and will put any football game on you want to watch as long as the patriots aren't playing.  Food is also great."}
{"text":"Castaways may seem an ordinary place from the outside. Yeah, you may be confused with its look, but never mind, don't judge, you know. So it is a charming spot, where you can get good food and nice drinks at affordable price! Are you a fan of beer pong table? This place is yours, and mine LOL. No jokes about the portions of food, truly giant. Be ready to split your order. I can only finish it by myself if I'm really starving! My hat's off!"}
{"text":"Rude bartender. Using profanity with customers. Will never come back. Tips are not demanded they are earned."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and gimormous, out of this world hoagies!! Boston, Ernie & Laura will most definitely take care of you! Super clean, delicious drinks and a great lil place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Castaways is my JAM! I seriously love this place. It is such a good place to watch a game or just to hang out. Their drink prices are a screaming deal and they seem to always be running a kickass drink special. Their pizzas are also creative and delicious. We usually order the Obama Drama with red sauce. It is basically a Hawaiian pizza but it is covered in delicious bacon :)
The bar has lots of TVs all over the place, a smoking patio, and bartenders with great attitudes.
My husband and I spent about $30 for something like 4 shots of fireball, two pizzas, and 4 beers. Amazing. I just wish it were a little closer to my house since it never takes long before I'm in no shape to drive :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere reminds me of a Southern Florida neighborhood beach bar. Its laid back, the bartenders are friendly, and its cheap. They're always running drink specials. They also have good sub sandwiches."}
{"text":"Looks like a normal bar from the outside, but once inside its a chill place to have good drinks and good food. They have beer pong tables which is cool. If you have a chance to eat here be prepared, the portions here are no joke. From the pizza, pasta to the sandwiches you better come super hungry and the food a great. Great staff!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite views is seeing the Papago Mountains from the inside and outside seating at Castaways. Friendly staff that makes excellent food at the most reasonable prices in town! Pizza and Italian Sandwiches are very, very, good."}
{"text":"My new favorite place  off track betting cheap drinks amazing food and great staff. Try it today"}
{"text":"They have lots of cocktail options and some shot specials. The beer selection is lacking. Bartender was a young guy but crotchety and rude. I guess I'd hate my job also if I worked in a bar on 51st St. and McDowell on a Saturday night. Castaways would be a way better place if they served better beer."}
{"text":"I have been a faithful customer of this establishment until today. I came in at two and ordered two pasta dishes to go. Played 3 races and then was notified they had no pasta (this is an Italian restaurant). This was 45 minutes after I placed my order. After watching 2 more races I asked for my bill. I asked if my bill was going to be accommodated for waiting for my food and being told they had none and blamed a sister location and the owner for not having any pasta. At this time a very large man-the cook comes out and starts yelling at me and slaps my paid for drink across the counter and it smashes into the floor of a full establishment and then starts screaming to \"get the fuck out of here\". He then returns to the kitchen and I ask the bartender if he was going to replace me drink- he states \"I can't he just asked you to leave\". I asked him what did I do for this type of treatment - he began to start making up things about me being notified immediately about them having no food-a lie it was 45 minutes. I looked at the customers and asked if there was anything I did to get this type of treatment. In unison-20 plus people said no and about 10 immediately left, with me. 
Boston the bartender I am ashamed of you. I have been a loyal customer for years and never does anything other than watch a few races and get food-then goes home. 
As for the big fat cook-you should be fired and never return to any job that involves interacting with any living creature. Your behavior was repulsive and extremely demeaning, not only to myself but every customer in there today. 
To the owner, you will probably do nothing. They-Boston and Fat Cook blamed you. 
I have been a customer since you opened, but will never return. This type of \"explosive\" behavior I do not accept. Hope you have video footage and you can view for yourself. Goodbye forever."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff!! The sandwiches are ginormous!!! And the pizza was amazing! Great prices and good choice of beer and drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here out of yelp reviews and it was amazing! We are from LA and I can assure this place is awesome! If you are looking for a good time with friends and good pizza this is it! Cheap drinks and good memories, ask for a guy with a Boston accent he was a sweet heart! :)"}
{"text":"Interesting meal here.  Not sure if waiter was new or his is how they do it here: we had to pay for our meal before we got it, like it was our tab for the bar????

Food above average not overly over the top.

Service was weird.

The server was maybe new as he also gave my buddy a hard time about something else."}
{"text":"First-time here and this place isn't welcoming. Went to the bar to order a drink, bartender noticed me but turned his back. Staff there don't even talked to you. Rude vibes. Never going back, off to Gypsy :)."}
{"text":"The only thing I remember about this night was the bar tab was $28 for 2 people drinking for hours and hours. I was expecting it to be like $80-100. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Great food good beer and horse betting!?  Yeah!? Great spot to have a good night to. 
Don't forget to tip!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: Yes, Castaways is a total hole-in-the-wall dive bar. It's small, it's not fancy, and it is -the bomb-.

I didn't know about Castaway's until my kickball team started using it as its league bar on Tuesday nights. The first time I ate there, I was super hesitant, not being a huge fan of bar food... but in all honesty, this is my FAVORITE place to grab a sandwich now! Seriously, I bet I've been to this place 20-30 times, and there is nothing better than the W sandwich. I've had the pizzas too, which are good... I saw someone else order some pretty amazing looking pasta once - but nothing can turn me away from that sandwich!!! It is SO good (and probably enough for two people!)

The drinks are cheap, and the food is good. Go with friends, and hope you're there on a night when they have more than one bartender. The guy that's usually there on Tuesdays does a great job of working his butt off to get to everyone, but the bottom line is that they need another bartender there on league nights. The time it takes to get a drink has become such a point of contention, they've actually considered changing bars over it...

All that said, if you can get in there when it's not slammed, bring some friends, grab a W-Sandwich, and raise your glasses! Cheers, friends!"}
{"text":"Castaways Sports and Sand Bar. Went on a Saturday, service was on point, food was great! Karaoke guy: Dick!!  Don't wast your time! Epitome of \"That Guy\"."}
{"text":"Dooooooooo not come for Karaoke unless you have a gun to shoot yourself in the head with...  I will never freaking come back here when Karoke is going on. It cleared the bar.. Unfucking believable!!! I bet I could sue and win for the headache that will never leave.. 

Stay away....."}
{"text":"Local hangout, regulars,  great prices on drinks, food is really good. Betting guys are intense. Karaoke too! Check in on Facebook get a free shot!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give less than 1 star?  All the bartenders were more concerned with watching their football game then serving their customers. Then half way through the second quarter they started changing all of the TV's. We won't be back. Who in the hell does horse races and NASCAR during NFL Sunday? They are letting their regulars run their business and if you are from this industry you know that is the kiss of death."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. How about I'll save my precious breath and just say I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL"}
{"text":"Let me start off with; I was a karaoke host a couple times in my life, also I know how to respectfully speak to other human beings. 
This was the second time I have encountered this karaoke host. And the first time should have been my red flag. 
If a guest wants to ask you simple questions and you are either too rude, too drunk, or too incompetent to reply with an answers that satisfies the question then you should not be in the HOSPITALITY industry. 
When I asked about certain songs and their versions he did not want to answer me and responded with a couple F-bombs. This makes me think that he has illegal copies of songs. I hope the owner of this bar understands he is losing good money by the people he employs. 
Do not go on nights that Dan Dan the Karaoke host is there. I can't speak for any other nights."}
{"text":"Drinkers BEWARE!! Check your bank accounts. I have had my tip amount changed for the SECOND and LAST time. The people doing it are very skilled, knowing the banks do not require receipts to be saved for amounts $15 or less. Bet you couldn't bet what my charges were, BOTH times?!?!!!! FIFTEEN DOLLARS! Hah! This makes it impossible to pinpoint where the alterations are happening. It's either the bartender or a manager. I'm shaking my finger at you guys!"}
{"text":"Great good always hot and fresh call ahead and beat the rush. Fresh food takes a little extra time, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"From out of town and this place has amazing food! I was blown away! Have to try  it! I'm passing the word by mouth to all my friends that live here."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical about this bar since I had been to it when it was previously Juggheads. I think anyone that's ever been to Juggheads knows what I'm talking about. I gotta say Castaways knocked it outta the park. It's owned by the creators of Giligan's in old town so it's got the same vibe, just not as... quirky. The location kind of sucks, and draws some funky characters but it's a great sports bar, and the food I've tried is pretty good so I'd definitely go back! I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Wonderful bartenders and great food. One of my regular spots and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"yeah, ok. here we go again. another dive bar.  on entering Castaways, , noticed a middle-aged couple groping in the corner.  an incredibly gross and revolting  tableau.  seated myself at the bar and waited for the bartender to wake up.
  just after I placed my drink request,  the bartender staggered over to the ice caddy and began sneezing, hacking and coughing. (No ice in my drink,  please...wash the glass with bleach..hold off on the spittle)
    An unfriendly vibe permeates the Castaways. The customers tend to stare down tourists visitor with a zombie-like glare.   No worries...had my vampire and counter aggression kit ready in my executive backpack. 
  Probably wont be back , unless I can locate Van Helsing as a bodyguard.   Watch your 6 if you decide to visit this watering hole,  Good luck, if you do."}
{"text":"Best karaoke jockey in town works here. Dan Dan the karoake man updates his books every week! I've done karoake in Arizona, California, Tennessee, and Texas and by far, Dan has the latest songs in his online catalog! The food at Castaways is also the best bar food I've ever had. I'm vegetarian and they have great sandwiches and great pasta too! Baked ranch potatoes are so delish!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Great bartenders and food is AWSOME too. Very reasonably priced too!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and sandwiches are delicious!  Fresh cooked bacon, great sauces (tried Alfredo and ranch sauce, both great), all around great food!"}
{"text":"Food is great staff is friendly drinks are stiff and a nice eclectic group of people plus Off Track Betting"}
{"text":"The food is great, the drinks are cheap (especially on monday/thursday), good times to be had here, shame they don't serve wings, otherwise great drinks,  great sandwiches, & great pizzas"}
{"text":"I like the look of the place and the food is okay. However I see alot of people commenting that this is a great dive bar. I agree but why do they have their drink prices so high.  This is not a fancy Scottsdale restraunt. If their prices were more reasonable I would definitely recommend to more people...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this bar every Friday night.  We have tried all 19 of Castaways pizza and if for no other reason, you need to go here to try them.  Their pizza is DELICIOUS.  It has a nice, comfortable atmosphere and all the bartenders are nice and welcoming.  If you're in it for the sports, they have TV's all over and are always playing the games.  Food and drinks are reasonbly priced as well.  And for us, the best part is that if needed, we could walk home. :)"}
{"text":"Castaways is the spot we go after our softball games to eat and have drinks. It's a great place for hanging out and I hear football Sundays are awesome! The only complaint I would have is if their service could be a bit faster in the evenings. Great place and affordable. The food is good too. And the best part is that you get a free shot when you check in on Facebook!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here...Erica was great...perfect attitude for the place!  Pizza was very good, drinks were good, but the  place was a little slow for a Thursday Happy Hour.  Lots of sports action to behold!
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The on tap beer is like what you would drink in college, on your bad days. 
But the prices - Awesome
Food - IDK if I would try it but some of the regulars were raving.. some people came in by themselves just for dinner. Nice big salad at a dive bar. (Interesting)

But, for being a non regular I don't feel the place was 100% inviting because of the bartenders attitude. It was... a bit.. ODD? to say the least. But nothing deal breaking."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service of any restaurant I've patronized in my 23 years in Phoenix. I only wish I could give them no stars. We ordered a sub sandwich and a Caesar salad, and when the snarky bartender came out to tell us our food was delayed because there were three pizza orders ahead of us, we told her we'd be leaving if our ordrer wasn't out in 15 minutes because we had a game to get to. Guess what? It never came out -- after 45 minutes of waiting!!! Not even an apology from the bartenderess, who was a class A, All-American bitch. Avoid this place at all costs if you want food. Even getting a beer was a struggle. When I asked Miss Bartender for a drink, she looked at me if I had defaced one of her tattoos."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good for a bar. The sandwiches are huge.  Inexpensive drinks and a fun crowd. Not too snobby and not to trashy. Just good people. Decent selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. We walked in the door and sat down at a dirty table for 45 minutes  and was NEVER acknowledged by 1 staff member. We sat there and watched 1.5 quarters of a steelers game and no one came to wait on us to take an order. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yes finally a dive I can stumble home from. Amazing interior tv's everywhere great specials. I got a new addition to my rotation."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every week! We get food and a lot of drinks and we never spend more than 30 bucks! The people that work there are amazing and there's always something fun going on! Plus, it's right by my house! Never too busy either, which is what I like!"}
{"text":"Not a complaint. Local bar/restaurant portion control was for two. If I lived on the area I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It is clean and the staff is friendly.  The boneless wings are great, their sandwiches are awesome and they have these super delish alfredo potato skins.  Beer is cheap and it is overall a good place to spend your time."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood dive bar.     U shaped bar with plenty of tables around... They have an track betting crowd but also lotsa regulars from the neighborhoods nearby... A lil mix of everything... All the staff is really chill not a true full kitchen but plenty to pick from subs pasta pizza boneless wings potato skins..this used to be a regular spit after Kickball on Tuesday nights. I've been here for weekend karaoke before and they play the sound for most big sporting events...."}
{"text":"We love castaways! We live nearby and have always wanted to check it out. It's great for watching games because there are TVs everywhere. Also, their food is AMAZING. We've had the sandwiches and pizza and it's some of the best we've had. It's clean, not crowded, and a very \"neighborhood\" atmosphere. Love it"}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The drink deals are great. And almost all of the bartenders are great. The only reason this rating is low is because of the female bartender with dark curly hair who was highly offensive to guests we brought to the bar. We highly recommended Castaways and this was such an embarrassing experience. We are weekly visitors who tip very well (when earned) and if it weren't for the other bartenders who are so awesome (Hazard and Boston) then this would have been our last visit to the bar. Karaoke is very entertaining and it's a great bar to chill with friends."}
