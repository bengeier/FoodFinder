{"text":"Moved into the area last year from another part of Charlotte, so we're relatively new customers.

Let me just say, aside from PF Changs and one or two other asian places, we struggled to find anything worth going back to in Charlotte. (and obviously PF Changs is pricey)

My family gets takeout from Jade Dragon probably twice a month minimum and we dine there as well, lunch or dinner.  We have yet to have a complaint!!  The food and the service is always awesome, the staff is always so fast and professional!!  Doesn't matter if it's takeout or dine in.  

The consistency is amazing.  I know every restaurant will drop the ball every now and then.  This place has yet to do it with us in as much as around 40 experiences.  

This is hands down the best asian food in town!!"}
{"text":"I only gave a one star because the food was edible (barely). The food was so bland and nothing close to authentic Chinese food from any part of China."}
{"text":"Always excellent service and food.  Tried various new dishes this time and consistently tasty at a good price.  One of the better Chinese restaurants in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great service.  Best egg fu young and edamame in town.  Very nice staff.  Worth the drive.  If you live nearby, they will deliver."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant that also delivers to our area. They will customize an order. Think their emphasis is Cantonese items, but not sure. I've never been disappointed! 

My favorite dish is the Singaporean rice noodles, & my husband likes the chicken steamer or any of the garlic dishes (Garlic chicken, garlic scallops, etc.)

Recommend them highly: dine in, take-out, or the wonderful delivery service!!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant through yelp as we were in search for wonton soup. How they have 4 star rating is a mystery. The soup is not authentic traditional wonton soup at all. Keep in mind, this is meant for providing comfort to someone who has tummy ache. We also ordered tofu with basil. Quite salty and overcooked for the tofu and basil. We were told that this is a popular dish. Truly disappointed. The redemption is when they offered both brown rice and white rice with what we ordered."}
{"text":"We are always treated well at Jade...good service, good food, good environment.

Now how about delivering to Piper Glen since Rea Road is finished?  Please???  :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Rice was fluffy not sticky. General Tsos was moist, crunchy and tender. No old grease or msg. The vegetable fried rice was packed with crisp veggies. The crab ragoon, spring roll and egg roll were all fabulous. The icing on the cake was the superior service and ordering support.  So happy to find this place in the neighborhood... I only hope they learn to make Wor Su Gai. Can't find it anywhere in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Have picked up dinner here twice and have been impressed both times. Service and food are both fantastic. Dinner combos are a great value. I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I just had absolutely the most tasteless Chinese food I've ever tried. Thanks, Jade Dragon! 

The ingredients all seemed to be fresh and the takeout containers rule. Now, if only someone could explain \"flavor\" to these folks. Seriously, I've had a lot of Orange Chicken in my time, some good and some bad, but until tonight I'd never had any that was 97% FLAVORLESS. (How does that even happen when a pretty strong flavor is part of the dish's name?!) But even the chicken packed a flavor punch compared to the fried rice. It was literally brown rice with some oil and vegetables. Apparently there is a strict \"No Seasonings\" policy at this place. Not so much as a hint of salt. And for the hefty price, this was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"What a gem!! Jade dragon truly lives up to its name. It is a rare find in Charlotte. The Crab Rangoon were amazing; truly a great start to any meal. We had the lunch specials which are great deals, ranging from $6.95 to $8.50. Lunch specials are a generous portion of food and they come with the most delicate spring rolls you have ever had. The Orange Flavored Chicken was bursting with flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. The Sa Cha Beef was also amazing with the perfect combination of flavors.

Only draw back is that they have no desserts, which my son wanted. Atmosphere is nice, decorated with traditional Chinese paintings.  Service was superb!! Our waitress was a delight and so helpful explaining the dishes. Nevertheless, the service was very fast, we got our appetizer and our dishes in under 10 minutes!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. . I always get the sweet and sour chicken and it's always fresh. Order is always ready by the time I get there.  Very nice customer service!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Restaurant in Charlotte!  Always excellent food and I mean every dish every time. Great staff and a quiet place to sit and visit with no noisy TV's everywhere. I go there all the time with friends and we can visit without yelling. A pretty rare find these days. Very clean inside. The nicest friendliest people of any restaurant I visit. 
I would give them 7 Stars if I could.  The only reason this isn't your favorite restaurant is because you haven't gone there yet. Whoever you take there will feel like you really wanted something special for them. 
I'm so lucky that I'm within walking distance!!!"}
{"text":"We have gotten delivery from here twice now. Quick, friendly, and not soggy or sad the way some delivery Chinese gets (I know you know what I'm talking about). We have been pleasantly surprised by the quality, too. More fresh veggies than frozen and tons of tasty meats.

If you're looking for tasty, easy, reliable place to deliver when you don't feel like leaving the house, this is gold."}
{"text":"Apparently Jade Dragon opened in April 2013. They have a small dining room that is comfortable but the A/C doesn't seem to work too well.

We all ordered dinner specials in the $7 per platter range - each comes with rice (no substitutions!) and an egg roll or spring roll. Everyone had a good meal and agreed we have found a new 'go-to' place for quick chinese food!"}
{"text":"The Chinese food at this place is amazing.  The restaurant itself is nice, too - there is a decent amount of room for seating and it's very pretty and peaceful inside.

I ordered the hot & sour soup and the general tso's chicken,  They were so good!  The soup was one of the best hot & sour soups I've ever had and the chicken was perfect - a little spice but not too much.  The rice was cooked perfectly - not dried out at all, which is what I usually get at most Chinese food places.  The amount of food that came out was very generous and everything just tasted great.  

The waitress was very nice.  

I will definitely be going here for my Chinese food fix from now on!"}
{"text":"Take out service was fine. Prices seemed decent. Literally THE blandest food I have ever had. I couldn't eat almost any of it. Really disappointed. I had the sesame chicken and vegetable lo mein. Sesame chicken was extremely mushy with barely any sauce. Lo mein was Yellow- not browned and again no sauce or seasoning whatsoever."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch. Prompt service. Reasonable price. Zen atmosphere. Great 1st time. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"I admit, I always get the same thing for take out, Sa cha Chicken, but it is always fresh tasting. The chicken is very tender and the veggies and brown rice are too. The employees are also very nice."}
{"text":"Take out. Food was terrible. Beef was hard, egg roll was over fried, and everything was extra salty. Honestly, my stomach is hurting as I type."}
{"text":"Chinese food is one of my favorites.  I've been going to JD 2 or 3 times a month over the past couple years.  It is a hidden gem you won't regret trying.

Positives 
- food is great!  Best Spring Rolls ever.  Great egg drop soup.  Everything is very fresh and flavorful. 
- Very clean.  Bathrooms are immaculate.  Clean bathrooms usually mean clean kitchen.  
- wonderful owners and staff who are attentive, friendly, and genuine.  Always helpful, always polite, always accommodating.  
- price is great (most plates are $7-$8).  I can feed my wife and three teenage sons for under $50.  Everyone leaves full.  Usually take home doggie bag.
- food comes out fast and hot.
- they deliver. 

Negatives
-  the only negative I can think of is the lighting is a bit dull and dated.  I would recommend using downward directional spot lighting in an contrasted dark space.  Spotlight some of the nice artwork.  Black ceiling. This would create a more intimate atmosphere and may attract more dine-in folks."}
{"text":"Super good Chinese food!!! It's not cliche like most places, it's calming, there's great artwork, and it's nice and cozy! The fried rice was great, plus the rest of the food.

The waitress was awesome and attentive, and she was nice. The food came out fast. I'm sure takeout would be great. They need sizzling rice soup though, a Chinese favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to eat at a decent Chinese restaurant in Charlotte for the first time, ever. 

As someone who comes from an Asian background and having lived in Los Angeles, I've had plenty of good Chinese food before, but sadly none in the past few years in Charlotte. We finally stumbled upon Jade Dragon after reading the encouraging reviews on Yelp. Equally rare is that JD scored a 95% sanitation rating, which is stellar for an Asian restaurant! I have to say that our meal was good (3 cups chicken and basil tofu were tasty; walnut shrimp was decent)-- food here will never compare to the best stuff in LA, but it's more than passable and hits the spot. Jade Dragon is easily the best Chinese food in Charlotte. We'll be glad to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!

Everything we got was sooo fresh tasting and well-seasoned that I am day dreaming about eating the leftovers for lunch right now!

We started with the spring rolls and wonton egg drop soup, both of which were delightful!  For the main dishes we got basil tofu, Singapore noodles and eggplant tofu. I was really impressed by all, but especially the Singapore noodles, which were not greasy or dry and expertly seasoned. The shrimp in them were not over cooked or rubbery at all. 

So surprised by the quality of the food from a Chinese takeout/delivery place!"}
{"text":"Dined here for first time tonight. Pleasantly surprised. Good food, good prices. Recommend to all"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a favorite Chinese place since we moved to Charlotte 4 years ago. After trying A LOT of places we have FINALLY found one to call our favorite - the search is over and they officially have our business from here out! 

The black pepper steak is delicious and the meat isn't tough or dried out, not to mention the flavor is GREAT! (It's a little heavy on the mushroom for me personally but still will definitely he peering from again!)

The Szechuan chicken was delicious too! With red pepper broccoli and mushroom, so good! 

Take out was ready in 10 minutes and ready to go when I showed up! Thanks Jade Dragon!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte and noticed the great reviews for this place.  Every word is true!  The entire experience was wonderful.  We were seated immediately at a four top.  The dining area is absolutely spotless and tastefully decorated, none of the cheap, gaudy prints or furniture here.  They offer a small selection of respectable beers for $3.75, a real bargain and departure from other experiences we had in the area.  We ordered the pan-fried dumplings app, sesame chicken, and General Tso's chicken, both as combination plates.  We agree, best ever, and with hot, crunchy egg rolls too.  Food arrived quickly, very hot, and perfect in every respect.  Sorry, but we advised the owner to raise prices!"}
{"text":"Don't sleep on this place!!! Had the shrimp lo mein, orange beef and honey chicken....everything was really amazing...no lie"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Had the general Tso's chicken. The flavor was good but it was mushy. Diet Coke tasted terrible. No one asked me how my meal was. I'd be willing to try again but I'll wait awhile."}
{"text":"I get delivery from here all the time and we eat in maybe once a month.  It is very nice and clean.  The service is friendly, you can always get a table, and the food is very good.  The ingredients are fresh, I've never gotten anything super greasy or oily, and never feel gross after.  The only suggestion I have is to order a little more food than usual as the portions are a little small, but at least you know you are getting real fresh food so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was bland and dry...if didn't order take out and have to be back to work I would of took it back. Both my coworker and I ordered and had the same reaction"}
{"text":"Great place to have solid Chinese food at a good price.  Food will well prepared, vegetables are fresh, and not greasy at all.  The food is very well seasoned and I would vote Jade Dragon as a \"go-to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far the best we have found in this area. The owners are very nice and respectful. The food is fresh and really good. The general chicken is very different from any that I've ever had. Hard to explain, but it does not have the typical general sauce. The egg-rolls and crab rangoons are really good. Delivery is quick and food is still hot."}
{"text":"A rare five-star rating,  Our now favorite Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area.

Very wonderful food.  They do it right and have some twists to their Cantonese style cooking that we love.  One of those is the \"Szechuan spicy won ton.\"  These are soft won tons in a spicy brown gravy, warm but not hot.  The sauce is of the peanut variety and the won ton dough is \"slimy\" in texture, but they are DELICIOUOS. It is not on the menu so ask for it, in fact, if you are heading there, call ahead to insure that they will set aside an order or two for you.

My wife and I fought over the final one and ended up making a second order which we laughed through as we slurped them down.  So yummy will go there today for lunch.

Their won ton soup is PERFECT, being golden yellow, flavorful and not greasy or infused with soya sauce.  Marvelous with those soft delicate won tons.  Do wish that they would have a larger order and one with vegetables.  Will have to ask for the \"wor won ton\" type of soup.

I find that the portions are fair, but not generous.  Rice is a measured bowl and the servings are OK for two people, but far short of what you get at other places.  You might find that where you order two mains you might want an appetizer or a third main.

And don't expect spicy. Cantonese food is generally not spicy, so please ask if they will juice it up if you like more zip to their dishes.  Some dishes they will and others, no.  Chef's call.

It was no surprise to me when I found out that the chef of this family-owned restaurant is the former chef of Wan Fu in Charlotte.  This is another reason to know who is in the kitchen.  It makes a lot of difference.

Jade Dragon is located in Quail Hollow, off of Rea Road in South Charlotte.  It is in a Harris Teeter shopping center which also contains more of our favorites, like Brooklyn Pizza, The Lodge and Mai Japanese Restaurant.

It is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere. The service was friendly and fast. But best of all was the incredible food.  It was a great value.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick dinner. I had the triple broccoli with beef chicken and shrimp. Flavors were good. Broccoli was crisp... maybe a little undercooked, but in a good way."}
{"text":"Just got take-out and will not be doing so again unfortunately. $36 for two bland as can be entrees, fried rice and one app. Orange chicken was so-so, fried rice tasteless, shrimp lo mein tasteless and reminiscent of Ramen noodles from college. Steamed dumplings were also a big letdown in the taste department and way too heavy on the dough aspect. Only saving grace was that whomever took our order over the phone spoke English well and was friendly, but beyond that I don't see any reason for us trying again."}
{"text":"Inconsistency is the curse of small restaurants like this one. 

We've eaten here a couple more times and while it's generally pretty good it wasn't as good as our first visit. Last time they gave me a mountain of Singapore fried rice, there was a lot of shrimp in it, but the dish was dry, the shrimp overcooked and it was so spicy that I stopped being able to taste the food half way through it. 

Also tried the Hunan beef for lunch, it's only like $7. The veggies were crisp, the beef was well done but still  reasonably fresh - unlike at the typical Chinese - but the sauce tasted boring. Honestly, I can't remember what Hunan is expected to taste like.

It's still much better than the neighborhood take out joints."}
{"text":"I have to be completely honest .... this food was nasty as hell ... I didn't even want the food but my daughter kept asking for orange chicken. So we come in the place stinks. The food has the weird odor and taste . I can't even explain it , but apparently people like it . I know I won't be back"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese I have found in Charlotte. I am a huge fan if Chinese food and it have taken me some time to find the right one that makes my taste buds sing! We dine in on 4/28 and the service was excellent. My husband order the egg foo young with brown rice and I ordered the honey chicken with brown rice and a side of veggie fried rice. When I tell you that everything was so fresh and delicious! The Jade dragon will be our number one choice for Chinese food in Charlotte forever!"}

{"text":"Nice little Asian restaurant tucked in the rather large shopping center.  Unlike a lot of Asian restaurants, the food wasn't greasy at all.  The flavors were good.  We opted for the combo platters--my kung pao chicken was only $6.25.  Wasn't a huge portion (wasn't small either) and it came with rice and your choice of an egg roll, spring roll, or two crab rangoons.  And, you can get that portion/combo at dinner too!

The only disappointment was that my kung pao chicken wasn't spicy at all, even though it had the \"spicy\" asterisk on the menu."}
{"text":"I finally found a great Chinese restaurant in charlotte!  I'm so happy and will definitely be a regular. We did takeout and got our order in under 15 minutes! Everything was fresh and warm.  We had general tso chicken, which is very good, but like someone else said very different from other versions I've had.  The walnut shrimp was excellent. The shrimp were huge.  It was on the rich side.  The crab Rangoon was reliably good as was the pork fried rice."}
{"text":"We got a takeout meal here for the first time on a Saturday night.  They said it would be ready in 10 minutes and it was.  The food was excellent and there was a good quantity for being a takeout order.  There were an abundance of jumbo shrimp in the shrimp and vegetables dish and there was no extra charge for the brown rice which is an up charge in some places.  Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went there first time with a large group - therefore had low expectations.  I was fooled - great food, perfectly prepared, (hard for a table of 16) and the sign of a well-trained kitchen and wait staff.  Well done JD!  Will return soon with wife to work our way around their creative and varied menu.  I looked over the shoulders of fellow guests and everything looked well prepared, appropriately cooked, and interestingly presented.  Several in the group said JD is consistently good.  Nice contemporary upscale dining room."}
{"text":"The food was just OK, though I must admit that the beef chow mein was just strange. Normally it has a brown gravy but this was just clear gelatinous sludge. Not a lot of flavor either."}
{"text":"Great food, love the delivery.  Really helpful, nice staff.  Our favorite Chinese in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good quality and a nice go to. Wish they would improve the inside experience. Surprising as of last night, they have a nice beer selection for $3 crafts. Which is great. But, only 3 bar stools. Lol."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to this area and saw the great reviews so I thought I'd try the food. The group of us ordered two sesame chicken combos, vegetarian fried rice and shrimp lo mein. The fried rice had almost no initial taste and then left an after taste of old oil and chemicals. The sesame chicken was chewy, rubbery and too salty. The entire meal was over 40 dollars which I also thought was a little high compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. The lo mein was never eaten because everything else tasted so terrible.


Update: the two people who ordered the sesame chicken got food poisoning."}
{"text":"First time here and we enjoyed it.   The interior is simple and plain (3/5) and not as decorated as other chinese restaurants, but I don't come in to eat the decor.  The service was fine and she topped us off constantly (5/5).  We ordered the pepper steak and sa cha shrimp.   The food came piping hot and fresh.   Both dishes tasted very good (5/5)  Wife said the egg roll was the best she's had in awhile.   The crab rangoon was good and on par with others I've had.  I recommend this place and would come again."}
{"text":"I saw the rating on yelp before I came in. This place is so great. I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch platter and my mom had the chicken and vegetables platter. The food was nice and hot, the portions were just right. I enjoyed this food so much. Check this place out if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Best Chinese ever!  Delicious fresh food and lovely presentation. Very reasonable prices and great service."}
{"text":"Food is very hot and good the only downfall is the price is a little high for a standard Chinese restaurant. Service is great!"}
{"text":"Yelp to the rescue again! While pet sitting off Carmel Road, I was searching for something, anything edible within a mile or two of the house. How can such a wealthy, affluent part of Charlotte still be in a total foodie desert?! Seriously. The only thing for miles is The Lodge (so-so), Maria Bonita (no thank you) annnnnnd Jade Dragon. I knew I wasn't in the mood for the Lodge and I wouldn't be caught dead in Maria Bonita, so Chinese take out it was! 

Previous Yelpers suggested ordering the Szechuan Wontons and thank goodness they did! These magical little dumplings, which aren't on the menu, come in the tastiest, spicy peanut sauce. I will be back to Jade Dragon when pet sitting again and will order these every time. 

Besides the excellent dumplings, I got chicken in garlic sauce with brown rice. It was a solid choice -- not the best Chinese I've ever had, but certainly not the worst either. Next time, I think I will specify which vegetables I like to avoid the dreaded red and green peppers but score the beloved mushrooms, water chestnuts, broccoli, carrots, etc. Why, yes. I have been told I'm high maintenance before thankyouverymuch."}
{"text":"One of the only restaurants in the area that serve traditional Cantonese food (that tastes delicious too!). We always come here for family celebrations/big birthdays. Definitely order their tofu rolls, ginger & scallion lobster, and braised duck!"}
{"text":"Headed by the former Wan Fu chef, this place is great (and I know my Chinese food).   This place is mostly a secret among the  Chinese community (for now); food is delicious and authentic. Vegetables, fish, walnut shrimp, fried rice, all good."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery. Good stuff here, got to my apartment pretty quick and was still very hot. The Pork Fried Rice was really great stuff. The chicken was pretty decent but something in my Kung Pow lacked in taste just a tad bit, couldn't pin point what was off. Overall though good experience and will be ordering again!!!"}
{"text":"Buzzable. The lo mein and the spicy crispy chicken were good (but not so spicy). The hot and sour soup was also good. The egg rolls were so-so. I am glad they deliver and I will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Nice family-owned restaurant and one of the better ones around the area. The food is light and flavorful compared to other Chinese places in town which tend to be a little heavier on the grease and somewhat bland. Hot and sour soup is one of my favorite things but many versions around town are not vegetarian.. However the one here is and that makes me so happy!  Also tried the veggie spring roll, veggie version of the Singaporean rice noodles, and stir-fried okra and tofu in black bean sauce. BF had the teriyaki chicken appetizer and walnut shrimp. We both loved the food and service was great as well! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Truly excellent! We had the Sa Cha chicken and Beef fried rice and the quality of the ingredients was far above most Asian places we have been. Service was great and ambiance was tasteful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time tonight. Portions and variety are normal and this place has such great reviews, I figured it would be excellent. I'm not kidding when I say every single one of our meals were horrible. Shrimp lo mein was flavorless noodles. General tsos barely had any sauce and there were bones and cartilage in it! The beef and broccoli-bland and undercooked.  The meat was definitely a shade of pink inside. My shrimp and vegetables in spicy brown garlic sauce came with tails still on the shrimp which was not only gross but annoying and again flavorless. Tasted like salty water.  This was the worst Chinese we've ever had and we eat out all the time. I never post on yelp, but I felt I should for how disappointing this was. $42.00 and everyone was upset. Don't waste your time or money. 18 Asian is where we will continue to order from. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Chicken and vegetables plate was pretty bland.  Hot & sour soup was also very bland.  They do not have sriracha sauce.  General chicken was good though."}
{"text":"I visit this place once a week. The stir fried okra is amazing and seems to be the only place I can get it. The savory three glass chicken is always a homerun hit!"}
