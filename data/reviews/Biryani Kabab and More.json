{"text":"Butter chicken,  kabab and naan were great. Chicken biryani was dry and the rice plain."}
{"text":"Scary place, good food.  Take out only!  Not sure if they had the health stamp of approval but, I don't care.  Taste so good and I have never felt sick.  The beef kabob roll is great and cheap.  All around great prices.  They also have take out.  Lots of veggie dishes too."}
{"text":"You want friendly customer service with a real smile? Do you want real original food. Unmodified to western culture?  Do yiu need to feel welcome ? You just found it. Not the cleanest looking place but the service and quality and quantity will make up for it. I promise . No eating in. Only take out. The chairs and tables are for seniors only please. Look at him on the phone.  His voice smiles when you are on the phone with him. I live this place but it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Just like Stephanie mentioned the place is really run down, I used to do takeout from them a long time ago, but got sick couple of times, also my wife prohibited me from going there ever again, it is too dingy for her :)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We had halwa puri and channe and eggs and it was HELLA OFF THE HOOK. My parents said it was the best halwa puri they had ever had. The location is a bit run down but don't let that scare you. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I went there based of the reviews on the yelp.Next time I will never trust yelp so much.I bet they have put these reviews not by their customers but their tech savvy kids. First of all this place is not for dine in.There is one table with chairs I dont know how they will accomodate multiple customers there. Now only one uncle and aunty in the kitchen.They adverise all day poori halwa breakfast from 11am.We went there at 1 pm and they said it will take 1 hour as poori halwa lady is not there.We ordered payas.That looked one month old frozen same with their shami kababs and biryani had an after taste.samosas were cold and horrible .Wheb we asked to warm them atleast he said they will become soggy so you eat like this.There is a dirty wash basin sink next to the table and no washroom.While I saw the puri halwa lady coming in and making puri halwa.She was making puri flour on the dirty counter.No foil no covering, didnt even bother to clean that place.So now all of us who went there and had food are terribly sick. I dont know how people in Canada can get away with this.Its people's life.How can you serve frozen expired dated and unhygienic food.It didnt even taste better. The uncle was more into scolding is or perhaps he talks loud I dont know but he wanted us to order before hand on the phone and take the stuff out.So then perhaps you shoukd say take out only. I wonder if a food department guy should visit this place and inspect the health and safety standards.I am still suffering from indigestion and so are my other friends who went with me to enjoy some tasty pakistani food."}
{"text":"I went in here after not going for about 5 years. Since that time this place has changed ownership and the interior has been very minimally upgraded.  The new owners have really turned this place around, the service and quality of food has changed 10 fold.   For those who aren't familiar with this place, they are a Pakistani/Tandoor restaurant. They offer Biryani as their speciality, but they offer other various dishes.   The food: I ordered two Seekh Kebab Rolls, I didn't order them both at the same time; since I ate in I had my first one and really enjoyed it and had one more! The quality as stated above has changed immensely, the food was very fresh and it didn't taste like the Kebab was re-heated which I really liked. I asked for it extra spicy so the cook/owner loaded it up with onions which gave it a very nice kick. I ordered my second one with a different type of naan, this time I had the Onion Naan (If you couldn't tell, I like onions lol). Since I ordered that type of naan it did take slightly longer to make so he had his son fry me up some Pakoras while I waited which was something I really appreciated! It's not every day you get free food! The second one was just as good, but I'd stick with a regular naan as it got a little too \"onion-y\".  Asides from that, I commented on how fresh the Kebab tasted and the owner told me he makes everything fresh, which contributes to the sometimes extended wait times.   The service: Without trying to sound rude, most other Tandoori places lack good service, but with this place that just the case. The owners are very nice people, they are super courteous and genuinely appreciate your business when you go in. Even if your food does take longer than quoted the owner will be very apologetic, something I witnessed and don't see too often at other places.    If you're in the area definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"3.5*  Chicken Biryani is one of my favourite take-outs!  It's fast without being too fast-foody, a meal-in-one, very tasty, and relatively cheap - or at least it should be.  And having passed by this place on multiple occasions, I thought that I would give it a go, as it's nearby!  (I was EXTREMELY hesitant in even trying this place out 'cause the outside looks sorta derelict.  Windows are cracked and covered up with paper, so I questioned whether or not it was even open for business!  However, 1 good sign is that it's been on the Wolfdale/Central Pkwy corner for a long time.  And luckily, the inside is slightly better than the outside.)  Tip:  The entrance is easier to access if you're going north on Wolfdale.  If you're going south OR coming from Central Pkwy, you'll hafta do a bit of a u-turn to get in.  Anyway, since I already knew what I was going to order, I didn't really look at their menu which was posted behind the counter.  So I don't really know what their \"and More\" entails, sorry!  1 stuffed, rectangular, styro container of Chicken Biryani is $5.50, no tax.  :)  I didn't dig through it, but the thigh that I got was nice and moist, albeit a bit bland.  However, there was lotsa flavour on the bottom of the thigh, most likely where it sat in the marinate.  Rice itself was decently flavoured.  The interior was less sketchy than Desi Corner, whose cleanliness is a bit questionable to me.  Anyway, I'll be going back for my next biryani fix!  I guess you can't always \"judge a book by its cover\"..."}
{"text":"Too bad, but the place is closed.  Now some generic shawarma shop has taken up residence."}
{"text":"this place is  not halal becuase i heard one of the inman said he they are not muslim they dont use halal meat"}
{"text":"I usually order a few dishes off their regular and catering menu. It's always been fast and delicious. I usually call in a large order to last us a few days and they have it ready for me when I get there.  It's inexpensive, delicious and the portions sizes are large. Their food is not as rich and fattening as most Indian restaurants.    I recommend the mixed vegetable curry, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, shish kabab, tandoori chicken, naan and gulab jamun.  Those are the dishes I've tried and loved!   Now this is not an eat in place, although there is one table there that you could eat in if you chose. It's one of those hole in the wall gems! The staff are also very courteous and even help to bring my orders out to my car."}
