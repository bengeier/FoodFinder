{"text":"Not a bad stop if you want to fill your tummy and have some time to spare.  The panni and onion soup (soup of the day) are great.   The waitress is friendly. The only issue is very slow and not quite attentive. It is like she is hiding somewhere most of the time and if you needed anything, get it all at once b cause you might not see her for another 15min. Lucky that I came to the airport early and got time to spare. Otherwise I would probably be quite impatient with the service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was extremely bad. I did not taste the food because I ended up walking out after waiting over 30 minutes for bacon and eggs and watching at least three people who came in after me and order the same thing get served before me. The only upside was they had free coffee."}
{"text":"Served all the white people beside me.....took them 20  min to ask if I wanted anything I relied a beer and never got a reply. Watched the person sitting next to me get 2 drinks before I even got asked if I wanted anything"}
{"text":"Not your typical airport breakfast! Eggs poached in house made tomato sauce,  6 pieces of bacon,  and Nutella for my toast. Near gate D42. Would have been nice to be able to get a glass of prosecco but no bar service till 11:00."}
{"text":"I travel through YYZ a lot. Most if of the actual restaurants are not very good. This one is the exception. I had the spaghetti with bolognese sauce and it was very good."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, it's not worth the slightly lower price of the beer.  First the hostess tells me to put my licence away (um, OK. Thanks mom) then I wait for 15 minutes (not even a drink) for a server to kind of  aggressively say \"are you ready to order something?\" I answer \"yes, I have been here for a while\" he answers in a pissy tone \"well we're all really busy\"  (they are not, I counted ~6 servers and the restaurant is 1/4 full) he should started out with \"sorry for the wait\"  I ordered the rose penne, it was obviously microwaved (top very dry, lots of hit steam when stirred) the pasta had too much sauce, too little chicken & mushrooms and packaged pasta noodles.  I had to ask for pepper & Parmesan. It was good that I asked when he brought the food as he didn't come back until I was finished for ten minutes and getting ready to leave. (It's an airport! People are jn a rush!)   He was curt, unfriendly and wouldn't even look at me.  I had a 3 hour layover, if he had of at least not been an jerk I might have had another beer or a coffee.  He didn't even ask and I went to give Starbucks my money.  Terrible service and really mediocre food. I travel through YYZ often & certainly won't go back.  Try millstreet, fast, friendly, attentive and good food."}
{"text":"The italian panini I had was cold in the middle, and completely tasteless (except for the grease.)  A bottle of water was $6, which is pretty outrageous.  The service was fast, but obviously too fast as there was no attention to quality.  Stick with the nearby Molson Pub if you need to eat in Pearson, the service and food are much better for only a few dollars more."}
{"text":"If you were a restaurant manager and a customer found mold on your cheesecake would you A. Apologize profusely, inspect the rest of the cheesecakes on the counter and instantly process a refund or, B. Deny responsibility. Blame the vendor who delivers the cheesecakes and make pathetic excuses delaying a refund  This restaurant opted for B. The manager has no managerial skills. The food is awful  If you are looking for mold induced food poisoning this is the right restaurant for you!"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice and did a good job, thats were the goid ends.. Wine menu advertised $45 bottle of wine which is already robbery, but then explained that menus were \"wrong\", and meant price was actually almost 20% more than what thier menu stated.  Then i ordered calamari, and wad SUCH A PILE OF SHIT, i couldnt believe it, but what was really a kick in the pants was even after i sent it garbage back, i wS still charged full price and manager wouldnt do shit about it!!  Liked this place before, but will NEVER set foot in this fraudulant SHIT HOLE again!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto airport. Good food and good service. I highly recommend the arancini and the Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Quote of the morning from the lady working the counter, \"I have no idea what's going on\". Tasteless blueberry muffin. Moist weird pizza sandwich. Ended up returning everything."}
{"text":"For airport departure lounge grub, I was flabbergasted.  This was fantastic!  The name of the place is not prominently featured, but you can recognize it by the Moustache Motif.  If you know that TV chef guy Massimo, you'll be able to pick it out.  They're licensed and have a very estimable selection of fine beverages (great wine list, lots of on tap beer, scotches, you name it)     My lasagne was perfect, good size portion, served piping hot (properly salamandered, not microwaved) and served promptly.  The salad was excellent.  I had a cocktail and a large glass of wine and the bill came to $40.    I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This is the worst f@&$@ service i have ever received.  I simply asked to order a full pizza and all of a sudden the order taker started yelling at me to come back in 15 min. it was 10am and there was no other customers.  I wasn't sure if i had it right or if i needed to order it. i also didn't want to end up wasting  15min for nothing. when i then went back to clarify she started getting mad at me and said come back in 15.  at the 10 min mark i asked if my order was almost done. To my surprise a second lady then said we won't have my pizza ready in 5min but that we will work on my pizza in 5min which will then take another 15min to reheat.  are u kidding me? the first lady then started speaking to the other ladies in some foreign language in an irate tone that she told me to return in 15min.  The owner of this joint really needs to review how these ladys are treating their customers."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and very well-priced.  I had the Pollo something (grilled chicken, roast potatoes and salad).  It was exceptionally good.  Way above and beyond what is expected for an airport restaurant.  YYZ has elevated its game to the point that I think its got one of the nicest airports I've been to in the world.  Right up there with the Asian airports and Dubai."}
{"text":"Ordered the Verde pizza, for airport food I have to say it was very good.  The problem was the service, to order a drink, get a menu, order food and get my bill I had to always work to flag the bartender down which you can imagine gets very irritating."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant almost a month ago. I was waiting for my lay over to St.John's and decided to grab something to eat here. I ordered plain spaghetti and it was actually pretty damn good. The only negative thing I really have to say is one of the female waitresses mouthing off to another co-worker because he told her someone was waiting for her at one of her tables. Her reply was \" Well she can fucking wait. \" like excuse you. You're job is to serve people. The waiters and waitresses didn't really seem interested in their jobs. At least the food was good so the cooks at least knew what they were doing. Due to the cooks I give this place four stars. They lost one due to their servers."}
{"text":"In the airport.  Bright and airy.  Has a bar counter.  Draft beer $10.  Stick with bottles.  The chicken panini with salad was surprisingly good.  Staff were attentive and friendly at the bar counter.  Tv screens.  A good place to kill time.  And watch people.  Food Prices not bad.  I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant isn't rated any higher! To me, it's the best sit down option in all of Terminal 1 @ Pearson!  Considering that it's airport food, a 4 or even 4.5 would be easily justified.  I had a lot of time to kill between my 2 flights so I decided to grab dinner there. Don't get me wrong, this is not a review for the \"grab and go\" section, but rather for the sit down area. Waitress was nice and quick to welcome me. I ordered a pizza (forgot the name - but it's the vegetarian option), asked if they could skip the garlic. It was no problem at all, the waitress even made sure it wasn't because of an allergy. A+ service right there and thoughtful of her to ask.  I grabbed a (bottled) Peroni to enjoy with my pizza, but they had a couple of decent options on tap too. My pie was HUGE and delicious, airport food or not!  You'd be silly not to eat here if you have a long wait in T1. It is most definitely the best option out there for the money (and I've tried them all).  I'm just thankful my gate was at the opposite end of the terminal. My belly is sooooo full."}
{"text":"Just a really yummy meal well above and beyond airport fare. Good solid friendly service. Price is not cheap but it is not too bad."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight while waiting for my flight to Winnipeg. It was the best meal I had at an airport restaurant. I ordered a pan seared salmon it came on a bed of grilled vegetables (onions, roasted red peppers, beans, mushrooms, capers, tomato drizzled with lemon garlic sauce. I ordered the Italian white wine to go with it based on the recommendation in the menu. It was great too. The salmon was priced 24 $ and the glass of wine 11 $.  It was a little pricy, however considering the location and the taste, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Yes it's an airport and the constant noise and movement doesn't allow for a relaxed meal, but this was a pleasant surprise.   First and most memorable was the lovely smile on the waitress. She was still cheery in spite of the location and it set up a little reprieve in the midst of all of the activity.   I had tagliatelle with a bolognese sauce and it was great. There was a large portion of pasta and some very tasty meat sauce that included some nice cheeses in the mix. Also provided was a good quantity of shredded Parmesan cheese and some fresh cracked pepper for lots of flavour.   I needed something to hold me over for a few more hours in the air and this just hit the spot - much better than something deep fried or between slices of bread."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh beautiful Italian food and wine selection. Worth being at the airport early for :-)  Had the Treviso Salad...savory, sweet, tart...perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Massimo with candied salmon for breakfast. A wonderful dish, rich, smooth tomato sauce with perfect over easy eggs and lovely little potatoes. The coffee is great as is the service. For an airport restaurant, this place is well above the standard. I would eat here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'll never award five stars at an airport, but this place might be close to one anywhere else. It's good sized, with a few high tables, bunch of standard ones and a lot of bar seating. Several large televisions for taking in the sport and just the right volume level. Quite a good selection of beers, though why you'd chose anything other than Moretti at an Italian I don't know. Food is fresh, tasty and comes in decent portions. Service is fast and efficient without being impersonal. Prices are steep, of course, but in comparison with the competition, nothing too eye watering."}
{"text":"Ate here twice: the pasta sauces are straight out of a Sysco vat and the pasta is overcooked. Service is not great. This place has only got location going for it, otherwise it would be out of business in a month. A subpar experience at best."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably the best choice of all the sit-down restaurants in Terminal 1 at Pearson. My husband and I had a 3 hour layover at the airport recently and went to Boccone for dinner.  I had the Fagioli & Tonno salad $14. It was argula, grape tomatoes, red kidney beans, onions, potatoes, a boiled egg, and albacore tuna. The argula was fresh and had that strong peppery bite that I love. The tuna appeared to me to be canned, but there was a lot of it. The dressing, which I got on the side was very rich and creamy - I only need a tiny bit. The salad was pretty good and was a decent size. I did not feel ripped off, as I usually do at airport restaurants.  My husband had the Affumicato Panini, which was $14 and came with a small side salad. We were pleasantly surprised that the portion of smoked salmon in his panini was generous. It also had a green onion frittata in it, goat cheese, capers, lettuce and tomatoes. I had a bite and it was great. The side salad was just mixed greens, but at least there was no iceberg!! He said had he known that it came with a salad he would have asked for the dressing on the side because it was drenched with dressing.  Other than that though, he really enjoyed his meal.   So overall, we were really happy with our dinner. We saw some pizzas coming out of the kitchen and they looked great. If we ever have the displeasure of having to dine at Pearson again, we will go back to Boccone and probably try the pizza (or have the panini or salad again).  Service was nice. The location is out near gate D40."}
{"text":"This restaurant had probably the worst service we have ever experienced and it was all the waitress because normally the kitchen has some blame but not this time. The only thing the waitress got right was the drink order. I ordered a panini and got the wrong one my husband ordered mac and cheese and it never did show up. She comes by and says oh sorry it'll be awhile. Omg it's mac and cheese and after waiting as long as we did it should have been put at the front of the line. She spent the whole time we were there running around like a chicken with its head cut off and actually she was a chicken with its head cut off. VERY disappointed"}
{"text":"I don't expect good food at airports, and I'm shocked when I find excellent food, as I did here.  Situated in a bright and open terminal, Boccone delivers on both atmosphere and food.  I had the Giardiera salad (with roasted yellow peppers, eggplant, onion, zucchini, garlic, and arugula), which was dressed with a subtle house vinaigrette that complemented the taste and texture of the vegetables (which were cooked to perfection).  Service was friendly.  If you're anywhere nearby, I'd recommend trying it.  Note that my review is for the sit-down restaurant, not the take away counter."}
{"text":"Been here a few times while waiting for flights.Like the robusta pizza with the egg on it. Different than the usual airport food and served in decent surroundings for an airport restaurant. Tables not crammed in too tight and good seating at the bar if you are alone. Make great coffee here too."}
{"text":"Can't say I had the best experience. Their staff rush you through everything even when it's dead and the potatoes and toast served to me were cold.  Apparently their pancakes are far better so I might still come back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this is as fancy as it will get folks! Run by the 3 chefs that own the O&B chain comes Boccone Trattoria. It's a nice space and their menu is very traditional Italian.  The score:  First: Ceasar Salad The Verdict: Loved the bacon, the rest was just OK. There wasn't enough sauce for the whole salad and the cheese, although properly grated Parmesan just added saltiness.  Secondi: Spaghetti and meatballs The Verdict: Meat balls were excellent. Flavourful and juicy but the tomato sauce... That did nothing for me. It was traditional in the sense that you could taste the tomato paste but it was too sweet and tangy. It needed some extra spices, maybe some oregano and fennel.  I can't remember what the main is called... so I'll call it \"main.\"  The main: vegetarian pizza The Verdict: It's not bad... It's not mind blowing. The crust was thin. That's all I got.  So in overall restaurant rating, it deserves a 3 star but since this is at the airport and selection is dismal at best, it gets a 4!  P.S. You have got to love the mustache. What a great marketing campaign!"}
{"text":"I liked the salad.  Ordered the basic for $10 decided to just order it as it comes.  No dressing on the side or any changes and it came out, nearly perfect. Maybe a bit too much dressing for my liking and that's why I'm giving them 4 stars.    I did get a side of crispy fried calamari which was surprisingly a good portion considering this is what I would call modern airport food, I was impressed.  Gone are the days of the old 70's and 80's style cafeteria when I would have to order up the rice pudding as part of the airports god awful food tradition that I had.  You can now order good food!  And this is what I found here while waiting for my delayed flight from my original booking that I got bumped off of.  Pssst the food is good but Air Canada sucks!  What's with all those delayed flights this week and overbooked planes and no service?   Glad I got decent service here before I get on a plane with a bunch of grumpy airline people."}
{"text":"Went in on a layover from Edmonton. Traveling with my mom who had been in here before.   I ordered lasagne, which I thought would be awesome as it claims to be authentic Italian. It was cold and very small portion, I have had better tasting lasagne from the freezer section of Safeway.   My mom had a penne type dish with mushrooms. Hers was too hot to eat when it arrived, but after it cooled slightly she didn't complain, but wouldn't say it was amazing.   Server wasn't the most pleasant either."}
{"text":"I had some time left before my flight, and got hungry waiting, so I checked all the restaurants in the airport's secure area. I ended up here because it's one of only two places where you can sit down and have a look outside. It was sunny so this made the difference.  What I experienced:  Very friendly people behind the counter, giving good advice and making the day so much more enjoyable with their smile.  I decided for the salmon panini, which was tasty, and I had a nice view outside while eating it. Not so many people here as in the other diner with bar next to it.  A back draw is they have a bar for coffee and drinks, but it seems to be closed at least during the day.  Conclusion: Nice view, nice people, simple but tasty food. And as someone in the other review said, it's an airport, so it's as good as it can get."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's an airport restaurant. But, the salad and the pasta were nicely prepared, the veal meatballs were tasty and numerous (4). The service was friendly and attentive. And the price wasn't heart-stopping, like most airport restaurants. I'dve been happy with the same meal on Queen West."}
{"text":"Acceptable airport food.  Just about everything is pre-made.  The Salami pizza was OK once warmed up.  This is one of a lot of different restaurants at YYZ."}
{"text":"My favourite place to spend my layover at Pearson  Try  bruschetta or a salad. I love their ragu, tastes like it has simmered for hours. In general, so much better than the take-out places nearby.   I also like sitting at the bar with a glass of the house red.  The staff are always very chatty."}
{"text":"Wanted to get breakfast and sat down and was ready to order before 1145 but they servers were too busy talking to one another that we missed it. Service sucks."}
{"text":"Very rude customer service and tasteless pizza. Doesn't cook it fresh. They just warm up the old food. You can taste the staleness. Stay away from this place. 0 for customer service and 0 for food."}
{"text":"This place is seemingly all about appearances. I ordered the ravioli and for 16 dollars received a few raviolis barely tasting better than canned ravioli.I didn't try their coffee or drinks, maybe that is where they shine, but my meal was lacklustre. The service was slow and not great either."}
{"text":"Better than any Wolfgang Puck airport restaurant.  For an Airport restaurant, this place is huge, great open air feel, excellent service and amazing food.  Highly recommended this place in YYZ Terminal 1"}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff and horrible espresso/americano. Tastes like boiling water with a weak coffee flavour. Wouldn't recommend this place for coffee, better off just going across to Starbucks."}
{"text":"I loathe airport food. I dread the thought of spending hours at an airport knowing I have wilted lettuce, frozen chicken wings, and day old yogurt as my next meal. But Boccone has created a standard I didn't think was possible. I'm going to miss the golden and red beet/goat cheese/arugula salad with balsamic dressing for days to come. And the stellar service and company. Thank you, Toronto, for giving me another reason to visit you."}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis, for a great cup of coffee before my flights. The coffee - Lavazza - is always great, the food is ok but the service, especially what I received today, could use a lot of work.   I was desperately craving an espresso con panna, and asked the girl at the register if they had whip cream. This may have sounded like a stupid question, but it had merit. However, it was treated like a stupid question and then she had the audacity to turn her back and walk away from the register as I was explaining WHY Id asked if they had whip cream!   As a result of her horrible attitude, I walked over to Starbucks, even though their espresso is not nearly as good. Then out of the corner of my eye, I see a group of servers from Boccone looking at me (some were craning to see me), with the initial server's back to me, as she is clearly re-creating our interaction. I waved, simply to acknowledge that I saw them, and immediately called the manager. Jude, who I spoke to, was great but clearly managing an immature group of workers not yet ready to work in the real world.  When you allow customers to walk away to your competition, even when the competitor's product is subpar, it is a poor  reflection on the establishment.   Sorry Boccone - one bad apple just ruined it for me."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service for an airport restaurant. Waiting 40 minutes for a pizza. May not even get it before our flight."}
{"text":"Think everyone can relate to the sub-standard quality of airplane food, the daunting task of finding something that's decent taste, really, that's what we're looking for, either right off the plane or getting something to bring on, despite the long lineups.    And I've found it.  Their Giadiniera salad simply superb, maybe a bit too heavy on the olive oil, but guess when you've got nothing else to do on the plane, it's hard to complain.  Best part was the crispy chick peas, roasted garlic, and roasted peppers.  Wished there was a proportionate amount of mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.  Glad they were easy on the onions.  I highly recommend this, worth even getting two ;)  Has its own large seating 'patio', thumbs up to their marketing for an experience as they put some extra decor to it."}
{"text":"Thought we would try out this Massimo restaurant while travelling through Pearson.   It did not start off very well. The hostess obviously did not want to be there. Did not even say hello simply how many.  When I asked her how she was her day she did not even respond. Had I not wanted to try out the restaurant I would have simply left. Not a great impression.   Once we sat down our party ordered drinks and we began to discuss our meeting from earlier in the day. The server came by and we said we need a few minutes as we did not look at the menus. In hind sight this was not a good idea. We could not get out sever to come back. After about 10 minutes we were finally able to have her come back to take our order.  Not great in an airport environment when passengers need to catch a flight.   I started with a caprese salad.  The salad was excellent with plump delicious tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil and candied balsamic with olive oil.  Very good appetizer which reminded me of my trip to Italy this summer.   For a main course I tried the spaghetti bolognese. I was a but surprised when I received linguine noodles.  The dish was average and the noodles were over cooked. Good thing they were linguine.    One of my colleagues ordered the BT Mac and cheese with green peas and prosciutto.  He devoured the dish saying it was the best Mac and cheese he has ever tasted.  I gave it a try and thought it was also very good.  Another of my colleagues tried the  Calabrese pizza.  He was not impressed with the pizza. The thin crust was soggy and the pizza was average. He was not impressed. He only ate about 1/2 and left the remainder. I tried a bite and was also not impressed.   All in all the food was above average but dependant upon what you order. The service was not good."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with our lunch at Boccone during a recent layover in the Toronto airport.     I ordered the capra pizza.  I can't pull up the menu online, but from what I remember, it had a pesto base with red onions, goat cheese, and roasted red peppers with an olive oil drizzle.  I enjoyed that the crust was thin and crispy.  I don't care for onions and had intended to pick them off, but these were cooked a little bit so I didn't mind the taste.  My husband ordered the spaghetti (or linguine?) and meatballs.  It came with a pomodoro sauce.  My husband enjoyed it immensely.  The waiter brought out a bottle of red chili oil and told my husband that it would go well with his dish.  I thought that was really nice of him.  The waiter wasn't the friendliest, but he was helpful and professional.  It was nice to have a calm sit down meal in the middle of a hectic day of travel.  The food was much better than I would have expected from an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolute trash. Maybe because the staff show any glimpse of caring about their work. Pizza was cold and doughy. We wanted a fresh pizza, they said it would be 30-35 mins as they obviously want to keep the conveyer belt of trash dough slip moving along. Shame on whoever owns this pile of crap and shame on whoever failed to train the staff. I travel to a lot of airports and the food does not have to be this garbage."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good breakfast then this isn't the place I can tell you that, but if you're in a rush then probably it is the place for you. Their breakfast is not very fresh, and the tasty is just okay I would say. I'll probably eat from home or find another place if possible next time."}
{"text":"We had some French fries dusted in sea salt and Parmesan and other cheeses. Very tasty if a tad salty for my better half but still good for me.  I had a beef Panini sandwich - solid but not special, a slightly wilted side salad and a beer. Wife had the tomato/mozzarella blend and enjoyed it.  Brisk and friendly service. Patron next to us was ticked that he was given a wine glass with lip stick which was quickly replaced but no apology or topped up glass.  Overall, it's a good place for lunch, but it may be a stretch for dinner. Somewhat pricey but it is in an airport."}
{"text":"I flew to Winnipeg this morning and had an early lunch at Boccone Trattoria Veloce, my go-to restaurant at the airport, before my flight.  I ordered what I usually order there ... a Calabrese pizza without the chilli flakes.  I love love love pizza and they make a good pizza.  It was a little burnt in parts so I left them behind.  The salami seemed extra spicy today.  My server spent a lot of time chatting up the guy next to me, ignoring her tables.  The hostess came over to let her know that a woman at one of her tables would like another glass of wine.  My server said, \"Oh, she's a drinker, is she?\" to the hostess and the fella she was talking with, which I thought was very inappropriate."}
{"text":"Really nice place.  Order from the restaurant - same price as take away. You get a side salad with the panini  Get a bottle of wine if 2 people or more.   We had a good server Gautam.  I recommend this place over some of the others in T1 by D gates."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch prior to boarding for my flight to Calgary. I love the open air concept and it's well set up. The food is fantastic and so much better than grabbing Tim's if you have time. They can get you in and out in under an hour or less if you tell them when you order.   Food- 5/5, they serve what I'd expect at a posh Italian resto Service- 2/5. No one smiles here. The hostess and the waitress were both very dry and nonchalant. They were not rude or unkind, but not friendly either. Atmosphere- 3.5/5, it is a resto situated in the hallway of an airport.   Be sure to try the meatballs and the pasta. My hubby loved the pizza."}
{"text":"Over priced airport food. I had the sicilian pizza, it was a safe bet. Not so bad."}
{"text":"Very mediocre place at Toronto airport. Nothing stood out, but it wasn't bad either. I just went there for a quick lunch between flights."}
{"text":"Best place to eat (all things considered).   Pearson airport ain't the Danforth but Boccone will make you feel half way there. While waiting in the domestic terminal I got to partake in enjoying some pizza and beer with my wife. The beer is gigantic-humongous. I like it. Pizza is a solid choice but it is pricey. As I said, all things considered it ain't a bad option."}
{"text":"This review is with a caveat ... the 4 star rating is at Greater Toronto Area Airport (GTAA) standards.  This means that airports are a rip off and quality of food is often on par with corporate lunch rooms.  If you get decent service on top of that, that makes it a 3 star.  For this celebrity chef,  Massimo Capra, 'restaurant', they hit all of those points and happen to make it a smidgen better than a company lunch room.  To me, that's where I feel this is a preferred place to eat if you're stuck in the Toronto airport.  Pizzas are the forte here and I would suggest only getting that as my colleague had not so great comments about the overcooked limpy pasta. I ordered the Calabrese pizza with the comment of 'well done'.  I would say that the pizza was definitely a step up from most other places in Pearson and a step up from casual places (Pizza Pizza, Pizza Nova, Pizza Hut...).  The crust was chewy but still had a nice crispy outer texture.  It wasn't too thin ... I would have preferred a bit thinner but it was a good balance between the light sauce and spicy sausage.  The topping wasn't sparse either.  The pizza arrived hot! Yes, this was dang pricey but considering this is considered food rather than an edible airplane meal, I actually liked it.  Service was a bit spotty... they were quick to serve the meals from the pass but capturing their attention for water or the tab was a bit harder to do.  The place was busy during lunch so I can somewhat understand but it wasn't like they had a line out the door.  They had the occasional table empty.    Overall, it's a 3 star at best outside of the airport but since it delivered a tasty, hot, and freshly made pizza, that puts it on my 'places WILLING to eat inside Pearson' list.  At the moment, only 3 places out of the many choices are on that list."}
{"text":"Wow I grabbed a slice of house made Pollo Pizza.  It was nicely grilled upon request, cut in 2 and packaged for easy access.  And YUM so delicious.  Crispy light fluffy crust, premium toppings.  So good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I know Airport food is supposed to be expensive but gee-wiz.  Single pizza slice with Salami topping $16.  Small Fruit Salad $6.  Dasani Water bottle (20 oz), $2.69.  While the pizza slice was larger than normal, it wasn't that big.  Where I'm from you get a whole Sicilian pie for 24 bucks.  So by that calculation, the slice was about 3X above the price it would be on the streets of LI.  It tasted OK, but you never quite get over the price.    The pizza would get three stars on its own but I've gotta subtract one star for the price."}
{"text":"I give a 4 star for the food, as it was really good for airport food! My team and I had caprese salads, with great basil and balsamic flavors - we al loved it. I followed with the grilled chicken on arugula salad. It was so flavorful and nutritious, it really hit the spot! I highly recommend it.  I think this place is hit or miss as my coworkers were not all excited about their food so make sure you ask your waiting staff for advice. We did have to wait for quite a bit to get the check, I had to flag someone as our waiter was nowhere to be found after our meal was over. TLDR: My food was awesome, service was not always present, coworkers not all happy with food choices."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this restaurant by Massimo Capra and was looking forward to trying it out, hopeful for a bright spot of good food in the airport. On arriving we said we needed to see the gluten-free menu which we were promptly provided. Husband ordered the tagliatelle Bolognese ( the \"tag boll\" according to the waitress) and I ordered the garden salad with salmon. Thank goodness he had eaten here before and recognized the pasta as NOT gluten-free...an asthma attack and other symptoms would have been the result otherwise. Everything was ok but that slip was scary; if it had been me with celiac disease, and not recognizing the non GF pasta, I would have been very I'll."}
{"text":"This place has saved my veggie bacon twice now.  If  you have ever spent time in the domestic terminal of Pearson, you know that vegan option can be hard to find early in the morning.  I was in Pearson at 6a and starved the first time I wondered into Boccone for breakfast.  They have a few vegetarian options, but none that are vegan.  Starving and generally freaking out, I asked the server if there was something vegan on their menu, she talked to the Chef and came back to announce that the chef would whip something up for me.  I received a mountain of sautéed veggies.  This last time (a week ago)  I was simply tired and hungry and looking forward to a long flight back to Vancouver and once again, the chef was able to put something together for me.  I never expect people to do things like this, but greatly appreciate they are willing.  Thank you Boccone!  Your willingness to accommodate other diets is truly appreciated."}
{"text":"With limited time and dinner sized appetites we were seated at a table for two in the sunshine at Boccone's so conveniently located right beside our Gate #40. Location location location! Unfortunately they were out of calamari and my other favourite bresaola but this leaves me a good reason to return (and the fact that this is without a doubt the best restaurant at Pearson and I'm a frequent flyer.) The beet salad was delicious as was the penne rose and the polpette. A glass of house red and Moretti beer, attentive and quick service and we were on our way. Delightful. We will be definitely be back."}
