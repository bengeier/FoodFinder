{"text":"This little shop recently opened up right by my work. It's been awhile since we've had something only a few steps from our building. It is brand new and as a result is very clean with all new equipment and fixtures.  When I arrived there were three customers actively interacting with the lady assembling the subs and two others standing waiting. The way the store is laid out it was hard to determine who was waiting to order vs who was waiting to receive their food. However within 10 seconds of my arrival the very friendly man on cash waved me over so I didnt have to try to figure things out on my own.  I ordered a pork sate sub. All the prices on the menu include GST which makes it easy to figure out. $6 for a decent sized sub is not bad in my opinion for a downtown Calgary lunch. The sandwich assembly lady was super friendly as well, serving customers quickly while still taking time to explain different ingredients and toppings, making sure guests were okay with spicy etc. (and if they weren't, adjusting accordingly). After she assembled my order, she made sure to give me napkins and then sincerely thanked me for supporting their new business. Awesome!  My sub was SO good. Warm, crusty bun, just the right amount of spicy heat, super fresh ingredients like cilantro, carrot, onion and cucumber. The flavours all danced together beautifully. Yum Yum in my tum!   I'll be back for sure. So nice to have something good, inexpensive and served by nice people, so close to work!"}
{"text":"The service is great.  Very fast and friendly.  Most sandwiches range from $5-6, which isn't bad for a foot long.  Meat sandwiches are served hot meat with fresh cold veggies on top.  I had the Pork Sate and it was just OK.  It seemed to lack a bit of flavor compared to other Vietnamese pork sandwiches I've had.  I also had their ice Vietnamese coffee.  It's a bit expensive, $4, but it definitely gets you pretty wired.  The place is very small.  Two small tables outside, with maybe enough to seat 6 people total.  No seating inside.  Overall, this is a great place to grab a quick lunch and is definitely a nice alternative to the ol' Subway."}
{"text":"So I've had my fair share of Vietnamese subs, and this is by far the best sub I've had. I always get the satay chicken and it was delicious. I recently tried my go-to spot just to compare again, but I have now found a new go-to. My husband comes here quite often and gets the beef, which I tried his too the other day and it too was very good. I highly recommend it! Small, but Very pleasant and welcoming when you walk in."}
{"text":"Express Vietnamese Subs is a small lunch spot downtown across from the Courthouse.  The owners/staff are kind, friendly and helpful.  The space is cleanly kept, but only seats a few (i.e. this is clearly meant to be take-out stop).  I ordered the Wor Wonton Soup, which was entirely fine.  There were 6 or 7 wontons, vegetables and garnish and the broth was good too.  There were also egg noodles in the soup, which seemed a little like filler.  The bowl is $12, which is a little bit steep.  I will try the Vietnamese sub next time I stop back."}
