{"text":"This is the real deal - the only authentic french bakery in the area. From the baguettes to the chausson au pommes - tastes like France. The service is kind (Normandie style) and friendly. Tons of regulars go there."}
{"text":"Fantastic pastries and excellent coffee. Had apple turnover, pain de chocolat, double espresso and a latte. This is now on my go to list."}
{"text":"Quality has been continuous and their menu has grown. A great addition to the Danforth and has become a go-to destination to have a coffee and pastry and to take home some croissants."}
{"text":"I always get the quiche with a coffee (americano). So good! Davide, owner, is very prompt with his service, and always very friendly, and enjoys having a chat, if you are so inclined. BTW, for those who don't know, everything, all pastries, quiche, coffee, EVERYTHING is flown in from Paris and baked / prepared in house. Check it out neighbours!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful cafeteria. French make French pastries. Very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"A great French cafe in the middle of Greektown.

All the pastry is flown in from France then baked on location.  We tried the quiche, lemon tart, apple turnover, French bread and tomato soup.  All were excellent.

For me it is the coffee that made me a return customer.  Great authentic French coffee."}
{"text":"Popped in today to get out of the rain. Friendly proprietor with a focused selection of in-house pastries. The pain au chocolate was a knockout. Good coffee.

Give it a shot the next time you are looking for a killer croissant."}
{"text":"Lovely interior and waitress. I had awesome eggplant quiche, cafe au lait and madelleines. I enjoyed it all very much. Only reason i didnt give 5 star is that it did not have alot of menu choice."}
