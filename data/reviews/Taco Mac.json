{"text":"Average bar food, incompetent service.  This is my third visit and waited over 2 hours for food.  Finally gave up and went elsewhere.  There are too many other establishments in Charlotte with a great beer list and much better food.  I won't waste my time here again."}
{"text":"Loved the Nachos All the Way!!  The Kenmore burger was delicious also. Our waitress was great.  Great service also."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection for a chain restaurant . Good service to boot."}
{"text":"Taco mac is an example of a great environment hurt by poor service. I love the large tvs and large booths, but the food took extremely long and our waitress was lack luster."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Place an online order for pickup. Arrived 30 minutes later at the time it was said to be ready for pickup and still had to wait 10+ minutes for my order to be ready. When I got back with my order, my fries were cold and my order wasn't even correct. 

I've have had several other awful service experiences from this place from before. From rude staff, incorrect orders, long wait times. First time patronizing this place in about 7 months, to see nothing has changed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to watch a football game that has a variety of beer, this is the closest replacement to old Park Road Champs that I have seen in a long time in the area... albeit a very loose replacement (e.g. beer, tv's and space).  

I suspect that the people who like this place are recent grads for who this is upscaling from their college hangouts.  The service is spotty, the food is fair, and the floor is sticky (the upscale is the beer, tv's and space).  

There are better places out there in this space.  I should have read the other reviews before going.  I also thought it odd that the manager was walking the tables asking how the food was."}
{"text":"When my family moved here in 2013 we were so excited to learn that there is a Taco Mac in Charlotte. We immediately started going to the South Park location about once a month or so. Unfortunately, we have never really been impressed with the staff at this location, but we kept coming back for the beer selection and the laid back atmosphere. After today's meal, I feel like we are done. The whole experience was just a nightmare. They were understaffed. Which we can be empathetic about. 

HOWEVER...

We ordered drinks that never came. Our appetizer came out incomplete. My $10 salad was almost all lettuce and MAYBE had an ounce of chicken on top. We were charged for four beers even though we only ordered two. A different waitress put hot food down right in front of my 15 month-old baby. My margarita was so watered down, I couldn't even drink it. And, the whole experience took over an hour and a half. 

My husband almost has his PhD with the Taco Mac \"Brewniversity\". That's a lot of money spent at one restaurant! I'm sorry to say, we won't be coming back to this location and if we do visit s Taco Mac, it will be back in Atlanta."}
{"text":"Worst and I mean WORST service ever...... We were a group of 9 who went for lunch. Food took around 45 plus minutes to come. And when we complained to the manager he said \"okay\" and left. We asked the waitress why is food taking so long so she says it takes long for large group and it will take some more time. 
I have never seen such a rude manager before. He did not even tell us that he will take care of our bill (which he did). When one of my friends went to show her weird taco, he said don't worry I will take care of your bill.
Once we ate - nobody came to us to say anything. We just left. I am going to call their corporate office and file a complaint.
I would never ever go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the beer selection is extensive.  But they still need a few more options from the Great Lakes Brewery.

Yes, it's walking distance from my office so a huge plus that I don't need to move my car and find parking.

Busy?  Always.

Loud?  Always.

Food? - Edible and soaks up the alcohol.  But a culinary experience, it's not!

Appreciate it for what it is, accept its limitations, don't expect a Zagat-rated experience."}
{"text":"My first visit was a Friday night and I had Tyler as my waiter. He really made it enjoyable with his down to Earth persona and silliness. Great staff makes a difference and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Good service, decent food. Management was quite disrespectful and unprofessional, which would be my only real complaint."}
{"text":"We've been to the SouthPark location a few times. The service is always terribly slow, and the food is mediocre. We waited more than 45 minutes last night for two orders of nachos, which is ridiculous. A manager came by our table and said they were \"busy\" and that's why our food was taking so long. She was unapologetic and didn't ask if we needed an appetizer or drinks while we waited. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to other Taco Mac's but this is the worst of worst!  The place was not even a quarter full. Took 20 minutes to get a beer at my table. I was told the kitchen was behind but 20 minutes for a beer??  I spoke with Zeke the manager who apologized and got our beers out about 4 minutes later and the wings a couple of minutes later. He gave us 4 napkins for 5 people who are splitting 50 wings!  What??!?!  Then I asked our waitress for more napkins which never appeared. I went to the bar and got some after 10 minutes.  Then I had to find waitress for the check. I asked if the manager was around and he was no where to be found. They gave us 25% off.

So let's recap:  25 minutes for beer, 30 for wings, 4 napkins, 5 waitress appearances, 2 turtle doves and a lousy manager who doesn't care about his customers. 

Please stay away!  After I left several locals told me it was horrible. If you need to see multiple tvs it's great. But that's it!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Manager was rude. Waitress were ... Well they musta been invisible. Cuz I didn't see any."}
{"text":"Great place to have drinks and watch sports.  Try the roasted wings with hot sauce.  I was surprised how good they were."}
{"text":"Terrible meal. Barbecue chicken sandwich was very dry and tasteless. I don't know if they have sauce to add to it because the server never came back to check on us after he brought the food. The onion rings were fried in a sweet tasting batter. Yuck! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good TVs and lots of drafts are about the only thing this place has going for it (but I'd question how often they clean their draft lines, so I went with a bottle).

Slow service... And I mean slow. After one beer and a shot we decided it wasn't worth it and walked to a different joint for our food."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The service levels have definitely improved.  Food was great, service was great (thank you Kristen), and most of all I was very impressed with how hard the staff was working to ensure everything was clean. It is spotless. This is very impressive compared to so many other restaurants with dirty booths, broken booths, dirty salt / pepper shakers, empty ketchup bottles, filthy floors, etc- basic stuff, but so important. Good work TMac. Keep pushing your managers to run your other locations as good as this one. This visit was 9 AM Monday August 24, 2015."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We ate an early dinner and there weren't very many people in the restaurant. The service was very slow and they got my food order wrong twice."}
{"text":"You can only give a place so many chances. The past 3 times we've attempted to have lunch here it's been a 15-20 min wait. I don't mind waiting but when there's at least a dozen open tables, it's not acceptable. 

When asked why the long wait with so many open tables, it's been the same exact  answer 3 times. \"We just sat two large parties and don't want food times to be too long.\" They seem to be reading from a script.

At least sit people at one of the open tables and take a drink order. Much better than making them stand around at the over filled bar."}
{"text":"The food was good and filling and their staff is very friendly.  Lots of T.V's to certainly satisfy ones craving for sports."}
{"text":"Guys from our office started with some wings that are marketed as extremely hot, but the three of us concluded that they had a a little \"zing\" to them. The buffalo style was not Buffalo and the blue cheese dressing that it came with was flavorless and seemed more like sour cream.

The burger and fries was good, but under cooked, the fajita was good as well, but the beans they came with seemed like they were reheated from three days prior and had a weird taste. The shrimp wrap was OK, but the pablano coleslaw had no flavor (they may have forgot to put dressing in it).

The server had a great personality, but was slow bringing food and had to repeatedly ask for the same refill of unsweetened tea, which he kept forgetting (he comped the drink). The waiter shrugged off our comment about the food when he asked our opinion. If he waited and listened and gave feedback to the manager, they could have a better product.

We won't go back."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:15 and sat at bar.  I travel quite a bit and eat at lots of different places mostly at the bar because that is where the best service is.  NOT in this case.  Worst service ever.  Felt like I was bothering the bartender anytime I needed something.  He never once asked if I needed anything.  To order a drink and food I had to track him down and give him my order while he looked so disinterested.  Food was ok but certainly would not come back here"}
{"text":"I was very excited to find out that there was a Taco Mac here in North Carolina because I used to go to one when I lived in Atlanta all the time.  I went with a friend on Friday night and we had an excellent experience overall.

A little strangely, the hostess sat us in the back room where there was not anyone else. It was quite loud in the front of the restaurant though, so it ended up being for the best. The back room did start to fill up as the time passed.

The waitress, unfortunately I do not remember her name, was very attentive. She checked on us often. And she let us know about joining the beer club, which was great because then the queso that we had ordered was free.

The queso was as tasty as I remember. I got the fried chicken, cheese, and mushroom sandwich, which was quite large. I definitely took leftovers home.

The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that they did not bring the honey mustard listed on the menu when they brought my meal. When I asked the waitress \"Doesn't this come with honey mustard?\", she said \"I could bring you some.\"  It was not a big deal, but her response turned me off some because I checked the menu again and they had made the mistake of not bringing the honey mustard, which she did not acknowledge by apologizing. But again, it was only a little thing."}
{"text":"Slow service, some menu items were out of stock. Extra plates came out dirty. Limited selection of foods. Took 20+ minutes to get the bill after I asked for it. They incorrectly charged me. The waiter was very slow at getting a manager to help remove the incorrect charges. The restaurant was not very busy and I spent 1 1/2+ hours there for dinner. Most of that time I was waiting on something (ex. Drink refills, extra sauces, etc.)  Not impressed at all. Highly unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Fun place to meet up with friends.  Lots of big screens with just about every sports game imaginable.  In that respect its an ADD nightmare.

I was slightly underwhelmed with the Appetizers.  

I joined the \"Brewniversity\" which tracks the beers I've had and offers rewards for sampling each of the beers.  It requires registering online, and when I did none of the beers I had appeared on my card.  I'll ask about that on my next visit."}
{"text":"I can't give a zero star , let's start from here. We ordered  some drinks and believe me it took 35-45 min to bring freaking drinks . Food can't even guess  , it took them almost 1.35 hrs for just to bring starter . Pathetic service . I will not recommend and will not come back ever ."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but ridiculous beer selection and \"roasted\" wings are best around!  I used to think Big Al's had the best, but no more.  Also there is no place in the entire restaurant including outside where you dont have a view of multiple HD tvs.  Great place for sports.  If you cant tell I'm sold.  If you live in the area and plan on going alot, sign up for the Brewuniversity card.  Its like the Flying Saucer reward system but with more and better prizes, atleast in my opinion."}
{"text":"the t-mac chilli is bomb with the nachos but i ordered wings and ive been sitting here 30 min and still waiting as i type this review but i hope the wings are good"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I would like to give it a higher rating... but I can't bring myself to do it. I've never tried the food but the beer selection is obviously good (150 beers. Yum!). The wait staff could use a little more training - like making eye contact with customers or delivering drinks a little more quickly (I realize that's not always in the hands of the servers.) Overall its a decent place. It's not going to be the first place I pick, but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Queso arrived lukewarm. It was solid due to not being hot enough. My food arrived cold. The server had it removed from the bill but one would think a manager would have come over to apologize. The atmosphere was nice, lots of draft beers and tons of tvs but now I understand why this place was not even at half capacity on a Saturday at 6pm."}
{"text":"Poor service combined with nothing more than an excuse for Mexican food equals a zero chance of a return visit."}
{"text":"Beer, beer, beer!  With a seemingly unending selection of beers on tap (and more bottled), Taco Mac is definitely the place to go to expand your horizons on the beer front.  Great selection of IPA's (my fav), and their Brewniversity program is really neat if you plan to return any time soon.  LOTS of TVs with all kinds of sports showing.  I especially liked the beer taps that are self serve at your high-top table.  Pay as you go!

Good food selection, but don't let the name fool you, this place is all-American."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go.  Went there tonight, many open tables.  We were stuffed in a booth and ignored for 15 minutes.  We decided there were better options and left with nary a glass of water.   I hate to say it, but this location has made my no second chances list.  We found an excellent place on Morrison Blvd and had an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"The place is pretty nice. TVs everywhere, definitely a place to watch the game. Great music. When it comes to the food, it's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"T. Mac is usually better than it was this evening, April 20th, 2015. Service was unreasonably slow, especially since I could see employees standing around looking lost. The manager of the evening tried to rectify the situation by offering to reduce the meal...but that doesn't give me back the time I wasted waiting on a simple meal. Do better T.Mac. There are still people out here that value good, efficient, customer service."}
{"text":"Save yourself...go to the South Park location, this one sucks. I got a bad beer and the manager could not even come to the table to explain why they could not take it back.  Long wait times,  warm beer...blah."}
{"text":"Taco Mac has the best wings around! The beer selection is always outstanding, albeit a little highly priced. The 'brewniversity' is a great idea to try out new brews.

This is a new location, the service wasn't the best but there was a large birthday party there at the same time, maybe 30 people. So I'm sure that affected it.

You should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have given Taco Mac multiple chances to redeem their service and they disappoint every time.  We once ordered take out from their Huntersville location and someone gave themselves a 75% tip on a take out order.  We reported it to the manager and were told it would be resolved.  It was not and we swore to never order from that location again. It did not surprise me when they went out of business a few months later.  2 years later, we decided to give the University location a chance.  It failed to meet minimum expectations as well. We put in a to-go order.  When my husband arrived, we were told they did not have an order for us.  After arguing with the \"to go person\" and showing his phone with the correct number and insisting we had ordered, she realized the bartender had our order the entire time and had not communicated it to her.  It was sitting on the bar cold after 15 minutes of back and forth.  In his frustration over the situation, my husband did not check the order and when we got home, he realized they had gotten it wrong.  Needless to say, the incompetence of this restaurant spreads to all it's locations and we do not plan to go here again."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try out Charlotte's Taco Mac because I'm not a huge fan of any of the Taco Macs in the metro Atlanta area that I've patronized.  

My only gripe about Taco Mac: Charlotte is its location.  Parking can be tough, but it's nothing that would keep me from visiting again.  The 4 Atlanta Taco Macs that I've been to all had more of a bar feel to them.  Charlotte's location is quite spacious and has a somewhat fancier interior.  There is also a second level.  Our waitress was great and had a pretty good handle on her beer knowledge.  If she didn't know the answer to something she'd get an answer from someone who did know.  The beer selection is definitely great.  

If The Liberty and Duckworth's weren't closer to my house than Taco Mac, I might visit more often."}
{"text":"Decided to meet a friend there for lunch one day.  After some trouble to park and walk back to the restaurant we walk in looking for a host or hostess and they are closed for lunch.  No notice.  No warning.  No sign out front.  Finally someone came out and met us and told us there was a utility issue.

Thanks for the heads up as we drove by looking for a parking spot......"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place - great beer list and appetizers - but the quality has plunged in the last few 6 months. The GM quit and they are perpetually short staffed. On 7/16, I waited over an hour for a mediocre shrimp wrap. The manager comp'ed the meal after I requested he do so, but that didn't change my mind. I'm not planning go back, and other friends who used to like Taco Mac feel the same way. Walk across the street to Birkdale instead and find something better and faster."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love(d) taco Mac. My husband and I used to go once a week when we lived in Atlanta. This taco mac, however, is terrible. We've gone maybe 10 times and every single time there's something wrong with our food. I stopped ordering the tortilla soup because it's always, always cold. Used to love the shrimp and avocado salad but there's hardly any avocado on it! And by hardly I mean one tiny bite worth. Three times I ordered it and three times there was one sad, tiny chunk of avo. I will say their wings are pretty good, but wings are hard to mess up. Don't bother coming here unless you want wings."}
{"text":"I'm sure you can read the previous reviews and get a good idea on what this restaurant is lacking. Which is why it has 1 star from me... 

But I would like to say that the manager I spoke with before leaving, Liz, was very polite. Going off how ALL the staff members were I assumed that would be her attitude also. Which was awful from everyone of them.... Luckily that wasn't the case. She was immediately apologetic and took full accountability on the issues. I wasn't just bought off with money for my next visit, or free meals either. She acknowledged the issues I brought forward and planned on handling them. I can fully respect a manager that is capable of addressing issues and is willing to take harsh feedback. Especially in person. So thank you so much Liz, honestly, you should go manage somewhere that's a fully functioning restaurant with staff who want to help invest in the company whole heartedly. Places like this taco Mac will burn you out. 

Good luck to future guests. Fingers crossed for you. I don't think I'll ever go back or recommend this location."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Taco mac, and most likely my last time. 

Pros: Large beer selection, and beer was served at a good temperature. 

Cons: I ordered a single order (10 piece) of buffalo wings with a side of fries.  The wings were not flavorful, and barley had any sauce on them. In addition, the fries were cold and soggy."}
{"text":"The food was just just okay and it took us almost an hour to get it. The kitchen was s l o w. The restaurant was 70% empty and our waitress made us WAIT a lot!!! I'm actually upset that we had a group of 10 because she didn't deserve the gratuity. Never coming back for mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Our service was good.  We had a good server who knew what she was doing. I ordered a quesadilla (not an appetizer, the  regular dinner one.)  It was awful.  There was barely any meat in it.  Plus it was in this burnt. dried out tortilla.  Terrible.  And it took well over an hour for our simple dishes.  The server apologized and said they were short on kitchen staff."}
{"text":"three strikes and your out the last time we went there we waited 35m between visits from the waitress and only reason she stopped was cos we flagged her down. The food isn't that great to make up for lousy service the last 3 times

the first time went there to watch the Clemson Carolina game and got a booth in the back corner with a TV right above us..ok np the game is on....next thing you know it gets changed to a different game. After fighting the clicker three times..called the manager over and he said the other table was watching it first( The table on the other side of the room that had the exact same game on right beside them). Mgr offered no apology , appetizer or anything.

Second time was more of the same. mediocre food and horrible waitressing that wanted to strut around more or go out to smoke than do their job."}
{"text":"The only thing this restaurant has going for it is a ton of TV's and a decent setting to watch a football game. Other than that, our experience was very subpar...and this is coming from myself and 6 friends at my table, and 5 friends that sat at another table in another part of the restaurant.

First off, we sat at one of the high top tables that had the built in beer taps in it. Great concept... but our taps kept spitting out all foam and no beer. The manager had to come by several times to try and fix it. And we were getting charged per ounce for all the foam! 

Secondly, the food was AWFUL. Between the 6 of us at the table, only 1 person enjoyed their food, but this is also the same guy that will eat 2 week old leftover pizza. I had the fish tacos, disgusting and soggy. My brother had the salmon entree, which was dry and plain. The 6 others also did not enjoy their meal. 

Lastly, the service was GOD AWFUL. Everything was slow for most of the night...but that happens at most restaurants during busy hours, so we let it slide. After we finished our food, it took the server 30 minutes to get to our table with the checks. It then literally took him another 15 minutes to run all of our cards, and he got several checks wrong. The worst part about this was one of the girls that was with us had to catch a flight and we told the server this several times. He did not try to hurry up by any means to accomodate. I think she made her flight though by a few minutes....

All in all, I would never go back. Neither would my 11 other friends who went with me that night."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Possibly understaffed.  Over 30 min to get a beer.  Appetizer arrived before the beer. Had to bother another waitress to get help.  Bathroom lacked toilet paper.   Food was good when it arrived though."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  Met a couple friends here and first it took the waitress about 45 minutes to take the orders then about an hour for the orders to come out, and no one ordered anything fancy.  Next problem was that I ordered a dessert but minutes later was informed that they are out of the item.  Then I proceeded to order a beer, which minutes later I also found they were out of, then this process repeated for 3 more drinks.  At this point I just decided that I obviously did not need to eat or drink that night.  The waitress was not apologetic at all and proceeded to disappear for so long that we actually had to flag down another waiter after waiting for close to an hour to get our checks.  She then returned to our table with the check and an attitude.  I actually live right around the corner and frequent the Piedmont Row area, but I certainly will not return to this Taco Mac.  Definitely left a horrible impression of the whole establishment."}
{"text":"This is the bottom line.....you go here for good beer or unique beers and/or to watch a ball game.  I would not recommend going here for the food (avg at best).  The beer taps at the tables are a great idea."}
{"text":"Decent bar food and plenty of beer styles on tap.  It can be very noisy when college football games are on."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Good service. Wings are good.  Bit overpriced though in my opinion."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beer on tap and tons of TVs. However, the service is poor and the food is subpar. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the amazing beer selection, I would never come to this place. The food is pretty crappy, and the seem to change the menu ever few months. But like I said, they've go great beer and lots of it. I will continue coming here just for that."}
{"text":"Food is served cold!  Party of six waited 45 mins to get 1 person food and the rest came out 10 mins later!  Send my food back and was question 3 times why.  
Do not waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Place is dirty and service is lacking at the bar. Food is a C, but when you see the condition of the restrooms and glance in the kitchen....only one word - DIRTY!  I've been going here since it opened and it has gone down hill steadily.  Beer is usually over-carbonated!  Management needs to get in gear and get this place back in order."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and won't go back.  Too many better places to go.  The hamburger was supposed to be \"medium\" and came burned and dry.  No forks in the utensil caddy.  The beer flight was served backwards so the tasting was not the experience we expected.  I had the feeling that everyone was new to their jobs."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I do believe I just found our new favorite restaurant. Chuck said he wanted a steak so we headed out. We thought we would try a new place. Oops its not a steak place. It's wing joint. We didn't get the wings... we started off spending 15 minutes going over the beer menu...105 beers in bottles and another 100 on draft. After a few samples we turned our attentions to the food. Nice choices from salads to burgers. Heather our waitress was outstanding. The burgers were the best burgers we have had in a longtime. If you like a laid back beerfest this is the place for you. We will be back next week!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are pretty good! tons of beer choices too."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd trip to TacoMac. I travel to Charlotte for business often. Great casual place to hang out and watch a game. Great bar and unbelievable draft beer selection.  Marty and Brandon behind the bar make every visit great.  Great guys and very knowledgeable about beer.  Most bars don't have great service like this.  Dont expect gourmet food - but the food is good with plenty of choices."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with the bad reviews; my food was awesome.  Got me a Rueben sandwich and a stout that had soaked in a bourbon barrell.  That one beer kicked my butt.  Good stuff, complimented the sandwich well.

Service was good.  If you're a beer snob like me and already know what kind of stuff you like, you won't be overwhelmed by the beer menu.  I go dark and high ABV so it's easy to choose.  It's not terribly expensive either, if you know what you're getting.  The quality of beer here is top notch.

I recommend it to everyone without reservation...that is, to beer guys and chicks.  If you want a \"nicey nicey\" restaurant feel, then go to one. 
If you want a cool beer place with good grub and tons of sports on TV (I like that they have skateboarding to watch!) then this is it.  
It's a guy's place for sure, or a place for a really cool woman.

Princesses that suffer from restaurant snobery need not darken the door."}
{"text":"This place is only getting one star ( and that's only because we didn't have to pay for our less than lackluster meal).

Came here in a group of four on a Saturday night, and there was a 30 min wait. Sure...fine that's no biggie.

So my group and I sat at the bar & ordered drinks and appetizers. When it came time to sit at our table we were in a nice booth etc...fine so far.
THEN... When we are ready to order our second round of drinks-which included 2 waters mind you....WATERS. Our ditzy server never showed up.
So the men in my group went to the BAR to order drinks. That's already an issue.
Finally, after waiting 20 min our server comes back around to get our orders.
Then after another almost 30 min our food arrives (we still haven't received our waters at this point) and our food was COLD. 
Cold wings, cold fries (ew) cold burgers.
So obviously our food was sitting in the window waiting for our ditzy server.
It wasn't even busy at this point!
There were at least 5-6 empty tables!! (Wtf).

So we somehow manage to get the manager over to complain, and the whole time we were talking to him...he had this stupid little smirk on his face. Super.
Maybe he was use to complaints? (The crowd in that area is questionable anyways)
So he took back our food that was cold to make us fresh & HOT food.
Meanwhile, our ditzy blonde server has finally come back with the WATER & she never even apologized. Pathetic.

All in all the food we got back was still gross, but we were so hungry we ate anyways ( I didn't eat my gross quesadilla....I munched on my friends salad instead).

Pathetic service, smirky/arrogant manager & gross food. Definitely wont be coming back here.

Watch out for the short blonde waitress with long blonde hair! You'll need smoke signals to get her attention."}
{"text":"Overpriced sub-par food. Everytime I've had their wings they've been overcooked and small in size as far as wings go. The prices of their wings are a joke also,  $10 for 6 tiny wings.. Gotta be kidding me."}
{"text":"Came in with my wife for dinner and a few beers. Would give 5 stars for good food and great beer selection but service was pretty non-existent. I saw the drinks sitting at the bar for a good 10 mins before our server brought them to our table. My wife and I ordered nachos and 10 wings to share. Food came out in a reasonable time and was great but by this time our beers were empty and our server was no where to be found. I had to walk up to the bar to ask for 2 glasses of water. Ended up having to flag another server down for our bill. I noticed what seemed to be a manager sitting at a bar table against the wall on his cell phone for the majority of our visit. 
I may have been able to understand if it had been busy but we were one of maybe 5 or 6 other tables in the whole restaurant. Overall a pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to preface this review with the caveat that I am both a beer snob and a football junky.

Went here last Sunday for football.  This was my second time here but had just gone in for a quick lunch the first time so wasn't really paying enough attention to review.

The first impression when you enter this place with the intent of watching football is that you have found paradise.  There must be 100 HD tv's in this place.  From my vantage point, other than the men's room, you're about 8 feet away from 3 tv's at any given point in this place!

We sat at one of the high top islands that had taps built in.  There was a cluster of 4 tvs directly above us, and they'll tune the tv at your table to whichever game you prefer.  The taps at the table are a little gimmicky, IMO, but a cool touch nonetheless.  

The beer menu here is extensive.  I'm not sure exactly how many beers they serve here but it must be over 100.  Prices for the beer were reasonable too.

The food that I had was just ok.  I ordered wings (what else do you eat while drinking beer and watching football?).  They were actually a decent size and cooked well, but my problem is with the \"sauce\" or lack thereof.  They pretty much didn't have any.  If you like sauced wings, I suggest you order extra sauce on the side.  

The service at my table was great.  The waitress was friendly and came to our table at just the right intervals.  

Overall, I prefer the Flying Saucer for hanging out with friends and drinking some cold beers, but for Sunday football, Taco Mac is tough to beat.  I do also like the Three Monkeys in Harrisburg for football, but sometimes they struggle with the big football crowd.  Taco Mac seemed to have no problem handling the larger crowd.  I will definitely go back for another football Sunday."}
{"text":"140 beers on tap.   My review should be complete at this point.   However, I'll go on to discuss the food and service anyway.   

The food:  Its a sports bar, don't get your hopes up.  The queso pablano is a pretty solid appetizer, but beyond that, you're not going to find any mind bending food here.

The service:  I come here a lot (for the beer).   Typically, the staff is well educated about the various beers on the menu and can give you some good suggestions based on your tastes.  But last night I went there some buddies, and wow did we get a lemon.   He jacked up our orders royally and didn't know the difference between a stout and a pale ale (seriously).   In his defense, he apologized profusely for being new."}
{"text":"I have visited the Taco Mac in the University area on several occasions. At first, I ignored the food because I was overwhelmed by all the games being played on the TV's. Once I got over the set-up, I started to concentrate on what I was paying for!!! I started off with chips, salsa and queso. That was not cheese!!! The queso was like glue and difficult to swallow. I had to take a drink of water to wash it down. The wings were the worse I ever had. They were undercooked and also naked. They were suppose to be buffalo wings(3 mile sauce). The celery was wilted. My waiter(Wes) was good but the food sucked. I am not a beer drinker but maybe if I was, it would have tricked me into not thinking about the food like the TV's did at first!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch so it was not busy 10% occupied.  I know servers have assigned tables and how the whole thing works.  The host took me and my son to a booth and it was wet from a server just cleaning it but obviously not drying it.  I told the host the table was wet and he said he would go get a towel and dry it.   I said we will just sit at one of the other 15 booths that are empty then wait.  My opinion if a server  can't clean his/her table properly maybe they deserve to be skipped.

The rest of the experience was OK,  had to ask for silverware after our food came.

Food was good fair priced.  I guess good help is hard to find in Huntersville."}
{"text":"YAY is right, great food, fun environment and amazing beer selection! Always a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Took a group of 10 and the service was bad, kitchen out of control. Half the group was finished eating before the rest got their food! Drink orders wrong multiple times."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and I liked the location. Was not aware beforehand that they only serve beer and wine. I am more of a cocktail person but, the frozen margarita I had was decent nothing to write home about. The service was good. I had the buffalo chicken taco plate again it was decent. Did not go inside instead sat on the patio which was good for people watching."}
{"text":"Always have great service here. Food is great and beer choices are awesome! Wish they had some better vegan options."}
{"text":"I visited the university location today,February 5th, around 1 in the afternoon. The hostess was nowhere to be found. A few minutes later she came around and went to seat us in the dining area, we asked if we could sit in the bar table area instead, and she make it seem like an inconvenience to make such a request. Once we were seated, it was another 5 minutes before someone came to our table. We ordered our beers and food and were left again until someone else dropped off our food. The Cobb salad I ordered consisted of lettuce, a few strips of chicken, a single grape tomato and brown avocado. There were several parts of the chicken that were inedible. Our beer glasses were empty shortly after receiving our food, yet the waitress never came over to check and see if we wanted more. She only appeared to give the check before we asked for it, instead of asking if we wanted anything else. We came in expecting a few beers and a good lunch, we were very disappointed with what we got. I could accept bad service if it was busy, but we were 2 of the 15 people in the restaurant. No one was friendly,helpful or attentive. I used to be a fan of and frequent this establishment, but the declining service makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"I give Taco Mac four stars based on service and the selection of beers offered. The food is not very exciting but edible and enjoyable. As one reviewer stated, this place is about the beer. Plenty of TVs to watch sports. A parking deck is located nearby, so you won't be hassled with locating a place.
The service is great from the time you enter the restaurant to the time you depart. You won't be neglected."}
{"text":"If I could put negative stars I would....sadly, looks and appears to be a great place....but take a second look...came here to \"change it up\" from our normal spot, worst...decision...ever!! 
Service is horrible, but worst of all they don't tag their tvs for the games...leaving it to a free for all. Games constantly changing tvs, and management saying they \"don't want to tag the tvs because it confuses the servers\""}
{"text":"Great service behind the bar.  Every time that I have been there with friends, we had excellent service.  Love the variety and the bartenders' willingness to sample some of the drafts.  Great go to spot after work!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always a good one to chill with friends, or just make new ones with the awesome waiters. 
Food here is pretty decent, but the atmosphere and super-huge selection of drinks makes up for it admirably. 
Great location, good prices, and uber convenient parking. Loads of outdoor seating and I don't even wanna know the total number of flatscreens they have up. 
The noise level, yes, can get a tad loud on game nights or weekends, but hey some of us like that.
One of my favorite hang outs."}
{"text":"Stopped in Tuesday night for a first visit and ended up leaving without ordering. A employee brought our menus then disappeared, waited 15 minutes while watching the rest of the staff chit chat with each other by the cash register. (One girl spent most of the time looking at her hair) Tried to get the attention of other staff a few times including someone I think was the manager but to no avail. The place was maybe 20% full. Won't be back. Maybe we were expecting to much but the interior is pretty barren and bleak as well, I guess they spent their money on TV's."}
{"text":"It is frequently difficult to eat at a restaurant with a food allergy. Recently one of our members ate at Taco Mac with their family including their allergic daughter.  The staff was unable to find the allergy menu but the manager came to the rescue. She double checked all of the labels, made the food herself, changed gloves and so on. She really went above and beyond and the family was so very grateful."}
{"text":"I like the convenience of this restaurant and the baked wings are worth the trip alone. My kids also love this place with all the tvs and the arcade. 

My biggest gripe is the very slow and lax service. It takes much longer for them to bring you a beer than it ever should, much less the food. We also had more than one occasion where they seemed to have forgotten about our order and in one case the manager hid from us instead of apologizing for a particularly bad service that day. 

I don't like giving negative reviews but write this in hopes they will recognize they need to greatly improve their customer service if they want to retain their customers. I doubt I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sports bars but none of them could prepare me for the amazing experience I had at Taco Mac. 

When you walk in you first see there are plenty of nice hd tvs all hung around the place which is great for a game day. The most amazing visual is when I laid my eyes on the over 100 beers on tap!!! From local to nationwide their selection is unmatched from every nearby bar. 

The food is what you'd expect from any sports bars. Burgers, wings etc. The food is nothing really special but it's all done well. 


Ian the manager who was working this night was the nicest most pleasurable manager I've ever met."}
{"text":"I can't remember if the food is good here or not. Oh, that's right. It's because an hour after ordering, I still didn't get any. To be completely unfair, wings and fries are a complicated and labor intensive order. Although easy to blame staff, this type of incompetence comes from the top down."}
{"text":"The second and last time I will dine at this restaurant.  Nothing good to say about the dining experience except the flatbread was great.  Long wait time, mistake made with our order, mistake in the bill, and the manager did not seem to care."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best beer selections I've seen at a restaurant in a long time. They also have THE best friend pickles I've ever had. And I have had a lot! 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the service was a little slow, especially since we were basically the only people in the place. They were, however, very friendly."}
{"text":"Only reason this place gets one star bc our Walter was great, manger was a dick head, we didn't like our food and was told that they have a policy where they don't take food back, manger also said that he can't lose money, and he will not be open if he took everyone food back, so fuck customer service, will never spend money at that company again def will be going to cheddar's next time.."}
{"text":"We live in the apartments above, and we used to stop in here multiple times per week, but will not continue to do so. Our past few visits have been extremely disappointing. The food is average (at best), the service has declined, they are usually out of a few of the beers printed on their DAILY menus, and their corporate office isn't doing anything about it. As a frequent customer, I reached out to the corporate contact message board the other day and all they really offered was \"I'm sorry\" and \"which location were you at?\". Not that I was planning on going back, but they definitely didn't offer any solution/motivation to return."}
{"text":"Fiesta chicken nachos are great. Tons of beers on tap and sports on every TV all the time. Open late with full menu served until closing. I love T Mac!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place, but my favorite thing about them was the way they pack up your take-out orders. LOL. I got wings and celery and a drink. When I went inside to pick it up, I stood their for five minutes until their bartender handed me the bag that was sitting in front of me the entire time - already paid for. Then unfortunately I drove away before I realized they hadn't given me the drink I paid for. On top of that, the wings and ranch sucked. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place! When we visit from Ohio, we always make it a point to come here.  The food is good, and they serve a lot. Cool promotions going on if you download their app. Service is quick, and the servers are super friendly. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Taco Macs in Atlanta and this location nowhere near represents the service level of a good Taco Mac.  I've been twice now while on business in the Charlotte/Huntersville area and both times my server has been lacking.  Everything from the wrong order, to the wrong beer and then when trying to correct the order, more problems.  

The atmosphere is excellent with so many TVs and places to sit.  The food is very good as their roasted wings are excellent.  The beer selection is mindboggling.  They even offer selections for those looking for a lighter fare as well.

I just have a problem with a location when their service is lacking like this location."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte, I was put up in corporate housing at Piedmont Row, right below the Taco Mac. Yeah, try sleeping on a weekend when there's a game on...the place was PACKED! 

On the days I worked until 11:30 at night, I'd get some quick takeout from Taco Mac, which featured a full menu until 2am.  (At least that's how it was when we were there.) 

The servers were super nice, and taught us this tip:  when ordering wings, get them with fries, and then a side of celery.  It'll be cheaper that way than ordering a side of fries. 

The wings come in different spicy intensities, and I think are nicely crisp/tender. The fries are decadent and crispy with a slight seasoning. When I want a greasy, late night snack, Taco Mac is where it's at. 

PS: for beer drinkers, the thousands of beer possibilities and the taps on some tables...very fun. (You can even get a print out of all the beers you've tried...it's like a collecting thing.)"}
{"text":"We had visited Cary's T.Mac sometime in April, 2015 and had a horrible experience - service was slow, food was good and not that good - the manager gave us a coupon for a couple of complimentary meals to try them again. We live in Charlotte, so, we finally decided to try T.Mac's Charlotte Flagship location at Piedmont Row. The service was fantastic (albeit it was 6:00pm on a Tuesday evening), Olivia was very on top of things and cheerful. We were seated and perused the menu. There is no bread or no chips before you actually get your meal - which we missed.  I ordered the All New Shrimp, Avocado and Mango Salad; my husband ordered the 3-handcrafted tacos (chicken, shrimp and steak). My salad was large, fresh and quite good, all though half way through it, I felt like it was missing something and I asked for a couple of tortillas. My husband's tacos were on a very small tortilla (we've never seen a tortilla that small) and dry. The tacos could have stood to have some pico de gallo or something to moisten them up. Then we ordered the Chocolate Stout pie for dessert - that definitely had a unique flavor. All in all, it was a good experience, and we were allowed to use our coupon."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It wants to be a family place, and would probably be really cool if the staff wasn't so concerned with pushing you around like the popular kids in middle school. I shouldn't have to beg or justify not waiting for all of the dining room guests to be seated for myself to walk four feet for a table in the empty bar table section. I understand how restaurants work, I get the hostess station, I just don't get why they have the \"I am SO cool that I don't even need your business\" attitude. 
The manager working in front was a total jerk, I didn't catch his name. He thinks he's extremely awesome...and encourages his employees to be snide too. The manager talked to me like I was seven years old for asking if the bar tall tops had open seating (no they don't....but you'll have to wait for allllll the families, obviously not sitting in the bar, to be seated in the dining room before considering letting you sit at any of the empty tables)...they pretty much just don't care because they'll be busy anyways.
It's an overrated Buffalo Wild Wings that is currently new and novel for the area, therefore busy. I might go back in a year when the power trip manager has been fired, or they understand that bullying guests won't help a business float."}
{"text":"The food is okay and they have an amazing beer selection.   The reason this is a one star review is the service. I ordered a beer flight and a water. It took 29 minutes!!! to get the beer. I had already finished my appetizer, placed a dinner order, and received the dinner order before the beer came out. To add insult to injury the server kept coming over and saying the beer should be \"right up\". After the third time it became comical. I had taken an Uber over hoping to enjoy a few drinks. I didn't dare order another after how long it had taken. Someone at another table was also waiting really long for their drinks and their server blamed it on there being a party upstairs. That's hardly an excuse. I've been here 3 or 4 times but the service has steadily declined each visit. I'm afraid this visit may have been my last, which is a shame because they really do have an impressive beer list and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday, when it was quite busy. Plenty of seating, didn't need to wait. Appetizer was cold and after waiting for our waitress to walk anywhere near us to send back the app, when they came back with fresh mozzarella sticks it was almost at the end of our meal with no apology or compensation. Our waitress seemed she had better things to do then get us refills or even bring us hot food as she was standing around talking. The grilled chicken avocado sandwich was good but the wings were just ok. I really wanted this experience to be better because the food was actually decent but the service and the cold app and meals just was unsettling."}
{"text":"The food here is brutal.  Makes me miss Champs on Park Road.  I'd say it's a great place to go watch a game, but only if you don't mind not drinking (much) - when it's crowded, it takes forever to get drinks here, even if you're sitting right at the bar.  I still don't understand why they card people who are at least 2X the legal drinking age, but maybe there's a good reason.  So don't forget your license.  The people who work here seem very nice though."}
{"text":"Is too bad this isn't a Flying Saucer or really any other place that hires attractive waitresses. This place is so loud, the wait staff is so disgusting and the food is so mediocre that it surprises me that this place gets as much business as it does. I guess it's because there are no other sports bars anywhere around South Park which is a shame. 

Between the pain to park and the poor food and service. I'll skip this place."}
{"text":"The story goes that 2 guys on their way from Buffalo to FL, stopped in Atlanta and opened a restaurant with wings, etc.  After the server told me the standard Buffalo wings were breaded first, I have to ask.......we're they thrown out of Buffalo, or did they leave voluntarily?
My recommendations:
1.  Buffalo wings are made by deep frying the wings until crispy, then tossed in a mixture of butter, garlic and hot sauce.
2.  When someone asks for \"Hot Buffalo Wings, they should actually taste like buffalo wings, and have some measure of heat.
3.  Your iced tea should be refreshed with ice if it is melted within 2 minutes of hitting the table, and refilled within a half hour of having only a quarter inch left in the glass.
4.  If you have run out of spoons, don't just deliver the bowl of chili without one and wait until it is cold to come back-then deliver a plastic spoon 5 minutes after.
5.  On Sunday afternoon, instead of having Euro league basketball on all TV'S but 1 (and the other had bowling), maybe you could tune in a baseball game or 2, the NASCAR race, or even a real NBA game on a few screens.

Just a few suggestions to make your next 1st time visitor come back.  This 1st time visitor won't be back."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant. The service was horrible. Waited for over an hour to receive our food. The kids received their food first and were finished eating before the adults received food. Two out of the three drinks which were ordered they were out of and when we first tried to order drinks they could not even find a drink menu. After the first hour of waiting and excuses from the waiter we asked to speak to the manager who never came. My husband finally went to go find the manager who was talking with another customer that was complaining about the same issue. When the manager finally came to our table, he had the attitude of \"Oh Well.\" We were also there during a time of a Panther's game...the televisions that we could see from our seats had the Seahawks game on. We asked if they could change the channel on one of the screen's and our waiter said the customer at the table next to us had reserved it to watch the Seahawks. Excuse me if I am wrong, but I thought I was eating in a restaurant in Charlotte not Seattle. Food was so-so. My family will not be back."}
{"text":"Taco Mac is a southwestern inspired American restaurant that will satisfy one's craving for good food and television. This place provides a diverse menu from tacos to burgers and wings. Also, there is a plethora of drink options- from a large assortment of beer options to several soft drink combinations containing your choice of flavored syrup. 

Another great quality of Taco Mac is it's operating hours, as it stays open pretty late. The only complaint I have  is the speed of service. In the evening, service is extremely slow. However, day time service is average."}
{"text":"1 Star is too many for this restaurant. I should've known better than to go back after a few other bad experiences, but considering it is in such a pretty location, I thought I'd give it another shot. The service is ATROCIOUS. We waited about 25 minutes for the first beers to come and about 45 minutes for the server to come just to take our order (as we sat with empty beer glasses). I work in a restaurant so I understand sometimes it gets busy and hectic, but it was SLOW. There was ZERO reason for our experience to be the way it was. The beers were flat and warm (tasted like they haven't cleaned the taps in awhile), the food was chilly (seemed to be sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time), and our wait time was never acknowledged by any member of that staff. Yes, they have an extensive beer list, but so do many other quality restaurants in the general area (Duckworth's on Montford is a great example!). I will NEVER go back and I highly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"This is my probably 5th or 6th time at t. Mac due to its proximity to where I live.

I have found their extremely slow service a consistency. I will say they were the only bar to show the ranger hockey playoff game with sound so that was a plus but whether I've sat at the bar or at a table.... The service has been atrocious. The food is okay at best.... Nothing memorable.. But there are plenty of TVs and space if you are looking to catch a game that is out of network. There are a TON of beers on tap.. So many that it may be tough to narrow down your choice unless you're a beer connoisseur.  Only come here if I have to.."}
{"text":"Good not great beer list... The list is very large but not very diverse or unique. The few I did want they were out of. Had decent recommendations from our server but all in all expected more from a large list. 

Food... GREAT! wings are awesome. Fish tacos were killer. All around good. 

Service... Left something to be desired. Seemed as though he had other priorities more important than the tables. Maybe it was the 300 tv's distracting him. Tv's were good to distract you from this service flop. 

I'll def be back. Only downfall was service everything else good!"}
{"text":"Their food is much better now then when they first opened.  My husband loves their wings.  They are one of very few who oven roast them which we like since my husband can't eat the traditional fried wings.  Last time we went was during the football play offs and parking was difficult to get.  We waited forever for a table and finally settled for one outside rather then inside like we originally picked.  It was freezing cold that day but the nice thing about their outside area is that it does have heaters.  They have a ton of TVs so if you can't see what's on its your own fault.  The food was decent considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"The only reason we keep going is their beer rewards program and the amount of TVs. The food is disappointing 4 out of 5 times (and then the one time it'll be delicious so we keep going hoping the good chef is working). Tonight I ordered a wrap and it came out on a bun. I ordered mild buffalo sauce and it was definitely much much hotter than mild. I ordered a side of ranch dressing and received none. Chicken was very dry. 
Other problems we often have are soggy or completely over spiced fries and not so fresh salad ingredients. 
Service is alright; neither terrible nor great. We'll keep going, enjoy our $6 beer, and hope it's a good food night. And then I'll end the night with a PBJ sandwich at home like tonight because the food was crappy."}
{"text":"I loved Taco Mac. I thought the beer selection was amazing and the waitress was knowledgeable about the beer. The food was good for a sports bar and the atmosphere was fun. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"this place has all the intentions of being rad, but every beer i ordered was skunked, and its your kinda place if u like drinking in a massive suburban cavern. the staff is kinda lazy also."}
{"text":"A good choice for late nights and sports. Good bar food and great service- our server Cathy Hernandez was one of the best we've ever had!"}
{"text":"We used to go to Taco Mac quite often, we loved it.  Then they changed their menu.  I haven't been back since.  I loved the a la carte tacos, and a some other dishes they just don't offer anymore.  They tried to \"class\" it up, and instead changed what we loved about it. The beer selection is great, but they do not have any specials (See Duckworths 3.50 nights).  Before the menu change, this was our go to over Duckworth's but, and I live in Ballantyne.  But now, I will just stay closer to home, with better food, deals, and the same great beer selection.  One thing hasn't changed though, the mediocre to sometimes downright horrible service.  This was always the worst part about his place, and before it was worth getting over. Now, not so much."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and try a multitude of different well crafted beers from all over. Not absolutely sure but me thinks they have 170 beers on tap and then there are some bottles. Lots and lots of North Carolina beers on tap as well. The food is also very good. They also have tables with taps built right in so one doesn't have to wait to get another beer. Not that we ever had to wait long. The staff are on point and willing to please."}
{"text":"We went to this Taco Mac on a Thursday night.  The food was very good, however it took FOREVER for the food to arrive, and the restaurant was not busy.   However, it was very tasty, and I do recommend the roasted parmesan zucchini!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here at the last min. Wasn't a bad choice. I had the burger. My husband had the fish tacos (chicken and beef).  Both were excellent! We will go back."}
{"text":"The beer selection is fantastic - 140 beers on draft! However, the service is slow, and the food is pretty meh. I've had better meals at dive bars. But I've never had Victory Golden Monkey Tripel 9.5% on draft at a dive bar , so it evens out."}
{"text":"3 African Americans at door asI walked in to dine and not a single Hello!! What are they paid for?! I walk to a seat and after 5 mins I had to ask for a menu. A couple of servers? walk around and not one asked me food or drink!! Did not feel welcomed as a dining patron at all and we done at various restaurants. After 10 minutes of ignorance and after talking with a 'manager' I resorted to sitting at the bar for a drink and service. We will not be returning!
I'd rate it a 0 if there was the number!!"}
{"text":"You think I would have learned after my first terrible experience there.   A party of 8, forgot out us and had to chase them down for a drink order.   Proceeded to take a considerable amount of time to get waters and beer then took longer to come and take food order.  And since they were on a roll got the order wrong.   So after a year give them a try again, wait 10 minutes for someone to decide to take an drink order, forget about us then get another waiter and he proceeds to forget what we ordered and then presented they don't have the beer we want on draft or bottle.   

For the love of God, you have to try hard to be this bad"}
{"text":"Good food, huge selection of beers. Service leaves something to be desired. Lots of tv's and different sports on. If you like beer and sports this place is for you."}
{"text":"Terrible service and average bar food. Does not compare to the TMACS in Atlanta. Last visit, we were seated and could not even get a waiter to stop at our table. We left after 20 minutes and did not even get a question from the hostess."}
{"text":"The worst service on the planet.  Message to the owners.    Fire your apathetic employees!  Absolutely no instutional control.   The gm couldn't get a job at Chucky cheese.  Cartoons"}
{"text":"Taco Mac is a great place in some ways and not so great in others.

Great things: HUGE beer selection.  Tons on tap and in bottles.  Self serve taps at the bar tables with OMB Copper on tap.  Nice environment with wood paneled walls, thick stone counters, some architectural interest with the 2nd level.  TVs everywhere - probably one for every customer.  Would be a good place for watching some event.  Nice location in Southpark on Piedmont Dr.  This area needs more bar type hang outs.

Not so great things:  beers are kind of pricey.  Not a place for conversation due to the huge distracting TVs everywhere.  Service was slow (though friendly).  Food is uninspiring.  Attracts the \"in town for business\" crowd.

Would be a killer and comfortable place to watch a game with friends."}
{"text":"The worst service I've received in a long time. Food was alright, good beer selection, but the service is enough of a reason to stay away. Our server heather had the worst attitude I've seen in a server. Not to mention she disappeared for about an hour and a half during our visit. We waited 10+ min for our first beers, asked for menus and eventually had to go hunt them down ourselves, didn't have silverware when our food arrived, and just had a generally unpleasant experience. When we asked for our checks, we waited TWENTY FIVE MINUTES, only to receive one check instead of split up and our waitress was clearly annoyed that we could ask such a thing. We spilled a drink and had to search for our own towels to clean up. We interacted with what seemed to be every other server on staff and they were perfectly pleasant. On the other hand, our server was constantly rolling her eyes and sighing with an annoyed attitude. If it had been busy, maybe the service would have been acceptable, but the attitude from our server was enough to keep us from ever coming back. As a server myself, I understand being busy and not being able to pay the best attention to your guests, but there is never an excuse for a rude attitude."}
{"text":"To be in such a nice area of Charlotte I expected good food and drinks. This was not the case. First off, the wait was ridiculous. We went and waited by the bar until our table was ready and we literally had to chase the bartender down for drinks because he wouldn't make eye contact with us. The restaurant was understaffed and the bathroom was a disaster. When we finally got a table it took quite a while to be greeted.  I ordered a Caesar salad with a margarita in a rocks glass. The first drink they brought me was in a tall beer glass and was disgusting because it was premade syrupy, sugary margarita mix. Totally cheap. The chicken on the salad was just microwaved junk and the salad was soggy and wet. A friend got the steak quesadilla and it too was disgusting and the steak was so hard and rubbery that it took several minutes to chew. This food was no better than cheap, overpriced fast food.  I literally got sick after dinner. The ONLY good thing about this place is the amount of TVs for watching the game. This place could be soooooo much better if they would invest in experienced people, serve real food and decent liquor drinks."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm from Atlanta and this review might not go very far seeing I'm not local but it's only to try and help this location improve there service. We went on a friday night around 8pm and was pretty surprised to find only that about half the tables were occupied with about 8 people sitting at the bar. I thought great,  service will be quick. After ordering it took about 20 minutes to get a draft beer, than another 20  minutes to get food. I put up the little red card in the holder which is supposed to signal your waiter that you need service. Well it stayed up there for over 15 minutes with no response. Finally took me getting the attention of another waiter.  I ordered another draft Brown Ale and was brought an IPA after waiting another 10 minutes for that one which was the wrong beer. Here is the funny but sad part, when the waiter sat it down I said that's the wrong beer. He said why, I said that's not a brown ale, he replied taste it and see!!!. If you can't tell by simply looking at color as a waiter I think some training is called for. I was nice and for fun I did taste it and explained to him what an IPA is verse a brown ale is. All that being said I was disappointed in the service but food was good. I can understand when a location is full service might be a little slow but it was far from that. 

I believe in second chances so we tried it again the next night being Saturday night. Now it was later around 11pm but once again very few people and no one sitting at the bar. I ordered a 6 pack original wings hot. After once again a long wait they brought out 5 wings. I asked the waiter to count \"not to be a smart ass\" but to verify only five. He said he would correct it. 10 minutes later I got one chicken wings on a plate brought out to me.  Now this time we didn't order any alcohol just soft drinks and food. I counted maybe 20 customers in the restaurant. Overall time from entering to leaving was 1 hour 35 minutes. 

From experience I should have known better than go to a place on a Friday night that should be super busy and only have 8 people sitting at the bar. But I really do enjoy the TMAC wings. Hope this place can work out whatever disconnect is going on with the servers, kitchen workers and bar staff."}
{"text":"Really should be 0 stars. Our family of 4 was seated but never waited on. They were not at all busy, either. 4 hostesses at the front just standing around. We walked out and no one said anything. No wonder the parking lot was so empty on. Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Food good... service are you joking, not even close!  Would have liked to have dessert and coffee  yet check was put on table so I guess we're out of here... never refilled drinks ask how our food was the list goes on..."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Beer good, wings good, TVs good, taps on tables - are you kidding me!!!"}
{"text":"Wow...how does a place like this stay open?  It was a comedy of errors.   Horrible service, excruciating long wait for our meal, food served cold, and uncomplicated orders incorrect.   
They play rugby which I like, and they have nice TVs, but other than grabbing a beer, this place is a must miss!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot if you are looking to watch a game because there are TVs everywhere and the beer selection is expansive with a ton of different beers on draft.  With that said, the service is SLOWWWWWW. It takes forever to get drinks and food and the servers are less than attentive. I will go back because I like the atmosphere but just be prepared to wait for things."}
{"text":"Tried this place a 2nd time and it was a HUGE mistake. The restaurant staff was rude when picking up the orders, the food was disgusting, and we had to throw away more than we ate. Definitely not worth the money and wish we would have gone to mcdonalds as we were originally planning on. Their food is far better than this crap Taco mac tries to serve."}
{"text":"I wish I could say something good about our experience here...it was all bad.
The servers have no concept of customer service! It took forever to get a refill on my drink. Worse yet, I had to get my own silverware, since our waiter never came back after requested we requested it.
The food order took over 45 minutes and was wrong when delivered. This was the worse restaurant experience i have has in Charlotte. Save your money and go to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out for the first time last night in search of some wings and beer. I was pleasantly surprised that they had my new favorite Jalapeño pale ale that Bird Song Brewery makes. The wings were also hot and tasty. The one thing lacking was the service. Everything seemed to take forever and the table next to us even asked to speak to a manager based on the level of service they received. Overall not a bad place and will venture back in one day I'm sure."}
{"text":"such a good beer selections.  all the food we've tried has been really good as well--the wings & cheesecake.  they are nice enough to let you sample some of the beers before being stuck with a not so delicious beer choice.  wait staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Moved to Charlotte a couple weeks ago and found this little gem down the street. Great wings! I love the table side draft beers and they're selection is broad and not too pricey. Good place for an afterwork beer as the crowd was very trendy."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the outside atmosphere and our food was good.  My service wasn't all that great.  I thought maybe it was just an off day but after asking a couple of my friends, their experience was similar.  Great menu, fun atmosphere inside and out.  Staff needs to pick up the customer service or you will loose your fans."}
{"text":"First and foremost this place is a SOLID 3.5 stars. ANNNNNNDDDD Beer fans, this is the place to be. They have over 250 beers to choose from and over half of those on tap! 5 stars in my book. Also, the selection of food was fantastic.  
Not being familiar with the area, it was a little difficult to find as the sign is not as large as other surrounding businesses. We parked and decided to walk as we knew we were close and sure enough we passed right by it. Love the outdoor sitting area too. 

Upon entering, it reminded me of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. They have a large bar area with a ton of large screen TVs for any sport enthusiast, booths line the perimeter with a few in the middle with several inner tables,both with low and high seating. Oh, they have upstairs seating as well. Great place for large groups or family. They do have bar tap tables that contain three taps of your choice, for purchase of course; however, call ahead to see if they are available. They were not available the day we went.

Food selections were impressive from flat breads, to salads, wings (pick your sauce), wraps, burgers and, of course, tacos. Staff were friendly and appeared to work well with each other. Orean, our bartender was great and for not being a total craft beer snob like me, he knew his stuff. We ordered take out - mexican sweet corn, slaw and apple & goat cheese flat bread. Orean suggested we double up on the side items as they are small. We ordered two corns and glad we did because he was right, palm size at best. The flat bread tasted awesome and loved the unique combo of apple and goat cheese, however, I was rather disappointed in the size of it as well. 

When asked why the restaurant had less than exemplary reviews, Orean suggested it may be due to the location and type of establishment. However, reading many of the more recent reviews, most mentioned bad service. Well, the service we received was top notch. Although the food tastes great, the portions could be larger considering the prices you are paying.
 
Yes, it is a sports bar in a part of town that is known to be higher caliber or as we say in Hawaii high makamaka; Yet it's classy, well laid out, and very clean."}
{"text":"I only recommend this location for the beer and sports. The food is not the best and the service is less than average. If you're looking to grab a drink and watch a game then this is a good spot. Anything else and you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"This use to be one of best places for watching the game, customer service, wings, and enjoyment. The customer service has fallen tremendously. 15 minutes for drinks (tea and Arnold palmer). Order the app and wings. Wing order is incorrect. You would think the waiter would apologize for the mix up. No he never checks in to see if the food taste good, correct order, or how the experience is going. Even after talking to another waitress the experience doesn't get better. We asked for ranch dressing and refill. another 20 minutes passes by. We end up having to ask another waitress for assistance. I will never recommend this place again. Highly disappointing experience and customer service."}
{"text":"the service was great, probably because we decided to go watch the heat/miami game on a tues night at 930...i ordered the chili con queso and it came with tortillas and chips, the tortillas reminded me of good ol texas...anyways i tried the mecklenberg fru bock and it was horrible, i got a warsteiner pretty good and a miller lite....do you see the regression pattern...anyways u have never been to a place where almost every square in of the wall was covered in brand new flat screens...i thought i hit my 409 cholestrol mark and died...awesomeness"}
{"text":"The food at Taco Mac is great. The atmosphere is a bit hectic with the crazy number of telivisions in the restaurant. The servce wasn't bad and at times could be very fast. My overall experience here was great."}
{"text":"Food not that good, but great drink selection. Service pretty good. Sat in a booth that the air conditioning was blowing at full force on us. Too cold, so we had to move (and I'm normally HOT ALL THE TIME). I had the black bean burger and fries. The black bean burger was too big it wasn't even cooked thoroughly. Literally the patty was like 3 patties in one. Fries under cooked as well. I will say that their Bloody Mary was AWESOME!!!! This place was so so, more like a place to just drink."}
{"text":"The salads are awesome. Wings make your stomach feel like you just ate five pounds of grease lol:/Hannah is the best bar tender by far at TMAC!!! I've had Lydia a few times and she's awesome too. The chocolate cake dessert is the BOMB!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, but definately will not be my last ! The service was great, and the food was delicious !! I had the Turkey-Que ( turkey with BBQ sauce ) and it was fantastic ! The french fries were AWESOME !! And the sweet tea was great, too !!
The only negative is the entrance...if there are more than a couple of people waiting at the hostess station and your leaving, you have to do a little two-stepping, but a small price to pay for a great dinning experience !!
Give em' a try, I don't think you will be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. This place is great If you enjoy 
a. two hour waits during football game days
b. sitting for twenty minutes waiting for a greet on a SLOW NIGHT
c. watching a server pawn your table off to another server so she can go get sloshed
d. bartenders and servers holding your glass from the rim after touching money"}
{"text":"The taps at the tables no longer work! I was told to go here for just that. Nothing special. 40 mins to get our wings. Not even worth the Uber out there from Uptown."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here. After making a tough decision - I chose to have the mix n' match tacos (shrimp, steak and street) and was glad to have chosen it! Also enjoyed mozzarella sticks as a starter --- they are HUGE and CHEESY!!! Loved them so much!!! They have the Coca Cola freestyle machine so any flavors of your favorite coke products. I will definitely visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"I came in around 4:30pm and was instantpy greeted and seated. I got my drink quickly, and had my order taken. I had the queso carne(which is delicious). I orded the bacon ranch burger (cooked medium). It was juicy and very good. The fries were seasoned just right that gave them the right amount of flavor.For dessert i had the chocolate  cake which is a huge, moist piece of cake. It too was very good. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"We were thrilled when Taco Mac came to Charlotte. However, we ate at the University location twice. The service was horrible. The food was greasy. The second trip was in response to a complaint that we called in to the restaurant. Even then, nothing improved. It is real sad to see the Taco Mac of the 1980s is now gone. The present day, cookie-cutter Taco Mac is just pathetic.

Addendum:  As you can see, my review was responded to by one of their staff.  Well, I think it is all an empty gesture.  Avoid the Taco Mac of today.  It is NOTHING like the ones that used to be scattered around Atlanta in the 1980's.  As for the response from Taco Mac, I see lots of them from the staff of Taco Mac on various reviews.  So, here's some food for thought:

1 -  Our second visit was because of a poor, disgusting visit the first time.  It was VERY apparent NOTHING had changed between the two visits.  Why would I accept a second comp visit only to rack up a THIRD horrible experience?  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on you.  Fool me a third time, I am just a f*****g idiot for going back again.

2 -  Instead of posting, \"gee, we are sorry\" comments, HOW ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEMS YOUR CHARLOTTE LOCATIONS SEEM TO HAVE?????  The Huntersville location has already closed.  It should only be a matter of time before the University and South Park locations likewise close.  I work in customer service myself, and I have to say that your responses and comp trips are USELESS unless you FIX THE PROBLEMS!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the big game or any game - BIG tv's everywhere. Depending on the size of your group, I recommend sitting in a booth which has tv's right in your face. You'll get sound overhead for the most prominent game. 

The beer list is the reason to come here, over 100 on tap and another 100 in the bottle. The service can be a bit spotty depending on the crowd, but normally it's on par. I haven't found any food that is worth ordering, so I just stick to the brew. The price of beer isn't the best, so I go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to nearly every Taco Mac there is - and this has been my favorite location so far. The place is clean. The service is good (well maybe because my cousin seems to know all the servers) and the food is exactly what you get at Taco Mac, a step above bar food, but nothing outstanding. 

We come here because you can watch multiple sporting events and get food that's much better than Hooters and Buffalo Wild Wings. If you come expecting that, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. It was a staple every time we came to Charlotte. Last three times we have been here the service has been horrible. This past visit sealed the deal for us. We will not be back to this location. Food was great, but the server was too busy hanging out at the hostess stand to get us more drinks, ranch, anything. We were there for over an hour and my drink was refilled one time. They were not busy at all."}
{"text":"I have probably eaten at a Taco Mac restaurant over 100 times in my life. If this restaurants last another 100 days, it will be by Devine intervention. 
Suggestions to attempt to stay open:
1- use a clean towel to wipe down tables
2- train your wait staff to listen and smile
3- check the lighting, dark dining in a sports bar is not recommended
4- if in the event a customer has a legitimate concern, and you are the manager, don't catch an attitude with the customer. 
5- have the staff take a few classes in customer service, have the manager take a lot of classes.

By and large this is the worst TMac in the chain."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick Team lunch.  After a short walk from the office, we were seated without a wait.  The service was fine and the food portions ample.  My salad had a good amount of chicken but few actual vegetables.  The black bean side was tasty.  Overall the lunch was ok."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and the restaurant was fairly busy for the opening game of the NFL season. Our waitress Ashanti was as attentive as she possibly could have been but it seemed like she was way overworked and the reataurant seemed to be understaffed. Therefore, service was slow. However, the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was nice for a game."}
{"text":"I took some out of town guests to Taco Mac this past weekend for a cheaper bite to eat.  You can find some great dinner choices here at super-reasonable prices.  They were doubly impressed by the extensive (and sometimes overwhelming) beer menu.  I sometimes think I'd like to try various ones, but with over 100 choices, I really wouldn't know which ones to pick, so I stick to a handful of usuals.  

I ordered the boneless chicken wings with sweet potato fries ($1 upcharge from regular fries but worth it because the meal itself is only $7; I tell myself I'm being healthy).  I ordered the Three Mile Island sauce because I love me some spicy chicken!  Unfortunately, they're *always* pretty stingy with their sauce (that's why I have to take away one of their stars).   I can tell because the chicken pieces are barely dipped in the sauce with a lot of obviously bare, uncoated spaces.  C'mon, now.  If you're going to dip them, really dip them!  I'm afraid to ask for more when the server brings them because a lot of places will charge you $1 extra for a side of sauce!  I don't want *extra* sauce; I just want what should originally be on there.  The bites should be totally coated in sauce, not randomly spotted.   

Shame on Taco Mac for their sauce-stinginess, but yum to everything else."}
{"text":"The Taco Mac franchise is pretty good considering.

It's fun to pour from your own draft tap, though it does add up quickly and foam counts...

The food is a few steps ahead of standard pub grub. The mexican food isn't amazing but it is better than some of the wanna-be Tex-Mex restaurants that seem to satisfy appetites here. Good burgers and pretty good wings as well.

These guys will give Fox and Hound a major run for their money! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Went to Taco Mac for the first time this past weekend and had a great time. 140 draft beers and 218 beers in the bottle (I think I remembered correctly). Found a seat at the bar on college football Saturday and was treated with great service. The bartender explained the beer menu to me and even asked what game I was trying to watch. Wrote it down and said he'd do his best to accommodate it....and he did. Tons of TVs and tables around the bar area. 4-5 of them have taps at the table, which is cool. 

For me, I ordered a few NC beers and maybe 1-2 PBRs (just to keep it real...ha). Also had the taco salad which was huge and good! Highly recommend it. I'll be sure to be back for more!"}
{"text":"My first time at Taco Mac in the university area was somewhat unpleasant due to poor management that led to understaffing the night of a Duke and North Carolina game. 

If your a manager in Charlotte everyone know that Duke and North Carolina will bring out 3 times the crowd to that of a normal night in any bar or restaurant in the entire state of NC so to be understaffed on this day falls entirely on managed and it should be addressed. We met friends there for a birthday gathering and it took 20 min to get a glass of water and drinks and another 45 minutes to get wings and there wasn't any apologies from staff of management regarding the long wait.  

I've heard a lot about Taco Mac and I finally got to see what it was all about and I was turned off by the service. 

On a positive note I will say that the food was excellent the wings very hot in temperature, The sauce was tasty and the guacamole and salsa tasted very good as well. 

I may return or NOT on a night that doesn't have a major sports event on that night but I just assumed that a franchise model like Taco Mac would be prepared for the biggest rivalry in college basketball Duke and NC 

My Only guess is that management was unaware or didn't care and staffed like a regular night and being that we didn't get and apology we figured she didn't care.  

Service gets 2 out of 5 stars 
Food gets 4 out of 5 stars 

Overall I wasn't impressed we drove from mountain island area all the way to university for bad service and if it wasn't for a friends birthday I would of went to north lake mall area and visited Fox and Hound or Buffalo Wild Wings where service is always prompt and great food."}
{"text":"Well.

Only once I have had a decent experience here, which is why I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1. That was my first visit, should have been my last. I have been a handful of times since and every time it gets worse.

Every time I go in this place, the service is slow slow slow. It usually takes over 5 minutes to even have a server show up at your table...and don't get me started on how long it takes to get a drink (and no I don't mean bar drink- I mean water or tea). The servers never come back to check on you and you rarely even see them walking throughout the dining room. When you do see them, they are either texting on their cell phones or flirting with the other employees. I generalize this only because I have seen it EVERY TIME I have been in here.

Last week, we ordered take-out for the first time. Just a few orders of boneless wings since we know how slow they are. We were told it would be 15 minutes to make the food. We showed up exactly 15 minutes later to pick up our order and the food was not ready. I don't mind waiting a few minutes, but we ended up waiting an additional 25 minutes over our quoted time. Total that up...it took them 40 (FORTY!) MINUTES to make a few orders of boneless wings. Those probably take 7 or 8 minutes max in the fryer. There is no excuse for that. They weren't even busy and they assured us they would be out any minute. Nope. Waited and waited, and nobody even tried to expedite the process. 

The food is actually decent. The boneless wings are really good and that is the only reason I keep giving this place chance after chance. After this last debacle though, I doubt we will be back anytime soon. But hey, if you love waiting and waiting and waiting, and subsequently being ignored by your servers, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Taco Mac has the best beer selection in Charlotte, with possibly the exception of The Flying Saucer. It's nice to have a great beer bar in the south part of town as opposed to Uptown or University areas. I stopped by on grand opening and it was fairly busy... good wings, good service, great beers! Great place to watch the game or games... next time my wife wants to go to the mall, I'll just have her drop me off here!"}
{"text":"The beer selection at Taco Mac is the BEST!  The only bad thing is that with so many to choose from, the decision can be a tough one.  With their frequent beer drinker program - Brewniversity - you'll never want to drink the same beer twice.

The food is also pretty great.  My favorite is the Pacific Cod Soft Tacos - there is always a good portion of fish and it is not overrun by excessive filler toppings.  The house-made cole slaw, enchilada sour cream and house-made pico de gallo are the perfect compliment.

The service is typically fast and friendly, even when they are busy.  Game days are especially busy because they have a lot of televisions showing various sporting events."}
{"text":"We love this TMac! It's always the first place we come when we visit Charlotte with our kids. Friendly service, great food and wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal. We had a large party of 11 at 2:00. The service was kind of slow since they weren't busy. It seemed as if the other staff would have pitched in to assist our waitress. The artichoke dip was awesome as were the wings. I ordered fish taco and two steak tacos. Both were okay. I like this location better than the University location. Overall it was a good experience and I'd be back again."}
{"text":"2 times in 1 week....worst service ever!   The servers were nice but it has to be the management behind the super slow service and horribly cold food/warm drinks.   Waited 50 minutes for an app and drinks.   Not to mention the other food and drinks ordered which took even longer.  Spinach artichoke dip with pita and tortilla chips?  This is what finally arrived after asking several managers about our delayed order.  

Guess the pic won't post but it was cold dip with 6 pita chips. No tortillas.  We are taking the football crew elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"I don't know why I thought ordering chicken with one of Taco Mac's specialty hot sauces at this location would be any different from ordering at the one in SouthPark.  As our *beloved* former president Bush would say, \"Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me...you can't get fooled again.\"  Ah, but you can George, you can!

So, how hard is it to actually COAT the chicken in one of their \"specialty\" sauces?  A few dribbles on top barely gives me a taste of it.  Is that truly acceptable by any chicken wing/finger standard?

I ordered a Buffalo Ranch Salad with TMI (Three Mile Island) sauce for the chicken.  As you can surmise, I could barely taste what is extremely spicy sauce.   I also noted that the \"chicken\" was basically just chunks of fried breading.  There was barely a chicken to be found.   I requested blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  The salad came with a big glop of chunky blue cheese dressing on top PLUS the server brought another big side of it.   It was a nice gesture, but geez...I didn't say I wanted to drink a glass of blue cheese dressing; I just wanted it in place of the ranch dressing.   I could barely taste the droplets of sauce on the chicken to begin with; with that much dressing, it sealed the deal.  

I love Taco Mac's menu options and this particular location -- the interior, the decor, the atmosphere -- but the service here for lunch is always a bit too slow.  Many of us only get an hour for lunch, and that includes drive-time.  I know I am taking my chances by going to a sit-down restaurant for my lunch hour, but I don't think a 20-30 minute wait time after ordering is acceptable for what is basically bar food.  

I really wish they'd respect people's lunch times and get some freakin' sauce for their chicken options that are all over the menu."}
{"text":"Beers...AWESOME...great selection, stuff you cant find everywhere...the food...EH...I wouldnt go out of my way to eat here, but If your looking for a good beer and a million TV's, this would work for you!"}
{"text":"Worst service! Every time I've come here the service is slow and that's being nice! Food is ok to poor!"}
{"text":"Good: Beer variety

Bad: Food. All of it. Incredibly bad version of the worst pub food you could imagine. My wife's \"Mac and cheese\" literally looked like Easy Mac from a box. It had to be, we laughed it was so pathetic. Queso dip was some skinned over, congealed, yellowish brown concoction. Steak quesadilla was passable. Just all and all the worst pathetic meal we've had in years and years."}
{"text":"I would have to say that our overall experience was a one star at this Taco Max location. Let's start with we sat there for about 7 minutes with seeing a server. Another couple came in after us and within three minutes a server (also our server ) came over and took their drink orders. I guess the server realized that she had another table and came over and got our drink order.
Fast forward to the arrival of our food most of the order came out, but when asked about our flat bread the server said she forgot to put it in and asked \"do you still want it\". We told her yes and she went and had it put in. She was all over the place the entire time not waiting for us to ask her questions or anything. We will never come to this location again. Eating out is expensive you should be able to enjoy yourself and not feel like you wasted your money."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice in spite of knowing what Taco Mac's reputation is in Atlanta area. The concept is great, the execution is poor. I believe Taco Mac's corporate philosophy must be flawed in order to hear the same story come out of so many locations, and that is world record horrible service!
First time there, there was confusion with the servers, long waits in between being waited on, and the busboy literally creeped up to the table while we were still there and took a few of our \"buy the beer keep the glass\" glasses that still had beer in them and ran off! Very odd.
Next trip in went like this: friend and I walked in, place not really busy, 4 \"hostesses\" standing around host station, after some debate they decide where to seat us, we literally sat there for 15 minutes without so much as a \"we'll be right with you\", attempted to get someone's attention, and then gave up and left.
This franchise could be so good if they could just figure out what is so flawed with the corporate policy..... 
Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Great service from Trey! Good food and a ton of TVs! Oh and did I mention that there are over 100 beers on tap. Thanks again Trey, we will ask for your section next time!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  Wings were ok.  I had the habanero sauce and orange mesquite dry rub.   They were both tasty.  I ordered the whole mushrooms side and ate them all... while they were tasty I barely felt light headed... no wonder they were so cheap."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We typically go once a week or so. The tv's are amazing. The staff is curtious and pleasant. The beer list is great and is always changing. However, dont rely on the staff to tell you about the beers if your not familiar with them, most of them dont know much about the beer list. We know a good amount of beer so it doesnt matter to us. The food is pretty good bar food, but nothing to special. The food prices are pretty right on and much cheaper then what you would expect for a grande restaurant like that in South Park. If you go on the weekends for the games they are very good about putting atleast one tv on with the game you want as long as one has not been requested already. They do have beer tap tables where you can pore three different beers on your own. The only draw back is if you do the brewniversity then those beers dont count toward your points. Get there early on busy nights because it is first come first serve but typically the wait is less than 20 minutes for a table"}
{"text":"Our favorite sports bar to bring out-of-town guests or to hit up when the weather is nice for patio time. The beer menu is 100 times better and bigger than the food menu, but I've had some nice entrees here. Also, they host events, so ask about the upstairs for private parties. Like any venue, if you arrive at 12:45 pm on an NFL Sunday, it will be packed and parking will be tough. But if you want 8 pages of beer menu and friendly staff, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The last few times I've visited this place has gone wayyyy down hill. My orders come out wrong or cold or both. Today's visit of course was no different. I ordered my food, waited more than 40 minutes and when it arrived it was cold. I want to like this place but I think it's time for me to take a little break. Ugh!"}
{"text":"140 different beers, wow!  The food was better then I expected.  Plenty of TVs to view whatever sporting event happens to be on the time you dine.  It wasn't rowdy or overly loud.  A pleasant surprise, when we first arrived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Call in order took 30 minutes after I got there to pick up. Bartender was to busy clean, greet people, pretty much anything. Host was at the front flirting with some guy, and not once the whole time I was there did I see the manager. Poorly managed,"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, they get my order wrong. Considering there were about four people in the whole place, you would think that it wouldn't be too difficult to pay attention to detail. I ordered a grilled buffalo chicken wrap with no blue cheese and a side of ranch. First forgot my ranch. No big deal. Bit into my wrap, no buffalo wing sauce. They gave me the ranch chicken wrap. The waitress came back out with a small side of buffalo wing sauce. Ok? I guess I'll just pour it on my sandwhich myself. Its not that big of the deal, its the principle that she couldn't just take the sandwhich back and have the correct one made. Instead of saying \"I'm sorry that your order came out wrong, let me get this fixed for you\" I got \"they are pretty much the same thing. Here's some hot sauce.\" The chicken is usually tossed in the hot sauce, then wrapped. Thanks for the 10% comp off my bill and still charging me for the side of ranch that I ordered. That whopping dollar I saved will definitely get me back in the door.  I'll be shocked if this place survives much longer."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and TVs. That's about it. Oh, well located at Piedmont Row. Food is weak."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheddar bacon burger with fries, my husband ordered wings and kids had chicken tenders ! The chicken tenders were seasoned so well and the fries were hot and crispy. My burger was cooked just as I ordered and my husbands wings were ok. I wish they were more saucy. Service was good and the bathrooms were clean. This place has the largest selection of beer ever!!! Also TMAC is located in a beautiful area as well! ENJOY"}
{"text":"They've got a pretty good beer selection and a lot of TV's.  That's about it though.  Service is lackluster and the food wasn't worth going out of my way for.  That said, this place is still waaaaay better than Bikini's next door.

Wheres the tacos and wheres the mac?  OK, they do have some Taco's, but nothing special by any means.  Tried them on a prior occasion.  I really didn't see any mac though.  They did have Highland cold mountain, which was the reason I was there.

After it took a good 20 minutes for us to get our 2 beers that we ordered the second we sat down.  Apparently because it took the entire bar staff to make one chick a chocolate martini.  I then realized I wouldn't be ordering much food here.  Six wings for about $7.  Not that great of a deal.  They were above average in flavor and texture, but that's all I can really say.  Oh yeah, hot wasn't hot, its more like mild.

We asked for our tab and that took quite a while as well.  I probably should have ordered another beer for the wait.  Good strategy to up sell guys.

Not impressed, no way the one near Duckworth's in Huntersville stays in business very long.  This one might do alright considering the other options around it but real beer drinkers will be at the Flying Saucer."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is extremely Bad! When we complained about the 10minutes it took to even get a waiter to the table, it got worse. 3 different times we had to flag him down just to get him to the take a beer order. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"My third time here. This time was thee worst. Trying to even get a seat was a hassle. They wouldn't sit us to accommodate our party which included several children. Then the food was terrible!! Just a terrible experience :/"}
{"text":"$hit load of beers to choose from. Tons of TVs to watch your fav games on. More than makes up for the lackluster food..."}
{"text":"I've come here for wings. Don't even bother giving me a menu. What kind of beer would i like? Something cold, preferably. No small talk, thank you. Just give me wings. Lots of wings. A wing sampler, a wing bucket, several plates of wings. That's all I care about. I've come here for the wings."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for a business trip and found this place since it was close to my hotel. I did not expect the food to be that great. I was wrong!
I tried their three tacos-very reasonable price too. 12$ for 3 mix and match.
I tried the fish taco, shrimp and Mango and the chicken fajita. All three were amazing and I finished all of them.
The surprise was the chicken wings. I just took a chance. Not the original one but the crispy ones. I tried those with a medium buffalo sauce (on the side). The chicken wings are absolutely delicious. For dessert I ordered the cheesecake. It was just about medium okay. I have had better cheesecake. I would skip it next time and given how close the cheesecake factory is to this place, I would go there for my dessert fix."}
{"text":"A little bit of this and a little bit of that.  I love everything...unfortunately today was a different story, waited approximately 50 minutes for salad, got home and realize it wasn't anything that I requested"}
{"text":"Terrible experience and inept staff. Not sure there is even a manager. 1 waiter for 20 tables does not work. 30 mins into dining experience our children finally got waters delivered to the table. Food arrived cold (except for the wilted salad that clearly sat under the heating lamp). 30 TVs in the place but no one knew how to change the channel on one of them. Never returning!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and drinks! I'm not a beer lover but there are great cocktails (try the Southern Hurricane!) for people like me! Great place to hang out and watch the game or just hang out after work! The wings are pretty good and the onion rings are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but the food made up for it. The buffalo hummus is a must ... I  don't know why I've never thought of that before, but I actually went home and made it for a party that weekend after having it at T.Mac. Sandwiches were all good sized, flavorful, and reasonably priced. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here again."}
{"text":"This place is close to my home and I wish it was good or even serviceable due to the convenient location.  The food is just ok which I would overlook if the service wasn't so awful.  It is not unusual to wait a LONG time for someone to come and take our order, refill out drinks, etc.  We have given them chance after chance thinking it may have been an off night, that they were understaffed, whatever.  But unfortunately TMacs continues to disappoint."}
{"text":"New Year's eve. Did we miss the memo that perhaps your usual chef is out on vacation? and did your hostess or whoever answers your phone too busy checkin her instagram to forget to put in our order on time? 

Take out order placed at 4:55pm, for a 30 roasted wing order- Mild, Plain, and Lemon Pepper. arrived at 5:20pm after being told the wings would be done in 20 min over the phone. 
Receipt indicates we paid at 5:41pm and we received food at 5:50pm. By this time, we were already annoyed. No more than 10 people in the restaurant. thank gawd for the countless tvs to keep us entertained while we awaited aimlessly, with no apology for the late food delivery. 

Come home looking forward to the wings. open boxes. The number of celery sticks included was about 8, with the skimpy small pieces which were not even crisp. I thought you are supposed to receive celery proportional to the order placed?!?! cost savings maybe. Proceeded to eat the lemon pepper, with no flavor of lemon nor pepper whatsoever. 6 people around the table compared the plain vs lemon pepper and all concurred they were the same flavor. Mild tasted more like someone mixed hotsauce and splenda together. 

Overly hyped, poor food, poor customer service. 

Maybe we missed the true chef since it was new years eve, but damn. that was some nasty crap."}
{"text":"If you like beer, good wing sauce and big chunks of blue cheese in your blue cheese dressing, this place is for you. Been here twice and both times the food and the service were great."}
{"text":"Was catching the Sunday afternoon games a couple of days ago. Service was lousy- took about 15 min to even get a glass of water! We ordered the original wings- sauce was good but can get much better wings elsewhere... The only things I did like about the place were the amount of flat screens and the beautiful patio area (if watching sports, that leaves 1 thing)."}
{"text":"This could be the BEST place in SouthPark if they would just make some changes.  The food is overpriced and awful!  The WORST Bloody Mary I've EVER had in Charlotte, and I've tried them all.  It so disappointing because its a great place to watch football!  It could be great!  Please, please get a real chef and a bartender who can make a proper Bloody!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to try new beers. This is the best place to watch sports in Charlotte hands down!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The bloody Mary's we ordered were I drinkable and I sent them back in favor of a couple of beers. The beer selection is the best thing I can say about this place. The service was slow and inattentive and food (buffalo wings) was mediocre at best. I won't be going to any taco macs in the future."}
{"text":"Upon 15 minutes of arrival, the group I was with waiting to be seated while watching the hostess text in a booth instead of seating us when there were plenty of tables available. A server brought all of us drinks but then left. After that, a new server took our order without enthusiasm. Her irritated demeanor made us feel like an inconvenience to say the least. After thirty minutes of waiting for our food, things still didn't get better. The chips were way too salty. There isn't enough water in the world to quench my thirst after eating those chips. In addition, we saw our server maybe twice in all. She continuously walked by on our phone. The experience was upsetting and embarrassing to bring friends from out of town to. Next time I'll think twice about returning."}
{"text":"So. Many. Televisions.  0_o

I'm in town visiting my parents and we heard they had a decent selection of craft beers so we went for lunch to check it out.  Beer selections are diverse and seem to rotate enough to keep it interesting, but our server knew almost nothing about any of the beers and could not help us choose something based on our other preferences.   They would do well to educate their servers better, have them taste the beers and take notes.  My dad and I know a lot about beer so we were fine on our own but how are you going to really sell anything to customers that may be new to the whole craft beer movement?

That being said, you can ask for a sample of beers as long as their are not designated as an 11oz pour on the menu.  Why, I don't know.. Again, our server couldn't tell us.

Other than that, the food was predictable but good.  Fajitas, burritos, tacos, quesadillas, salads, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.  That sort of thing.   I had the original burger and it had nice chargrilled flavor and a soft buttery bun.  Didn't really need much in the way of condiments.   However, I think it's completely ridiculous that they cannot  cook anything less than medium.  Seriously, is that a law or something?  Lame.  

My side salad was large but mostly lettuce...  some variation in vegetables outside of the standard tomato and cucumber would be nice.... but at least it was fresh.  

My folks had the wings, and I sampled my moms order since she had the boneless  (I generally think
 wings are way more trouble than they're worth)...    They were good, and the medium spice was on the hotter side of medium (and rather salty in my opinion).   She had a hard time with them being as spicy as they were.  I probably wouldn't want to eat more than a couple, myself... more due to the salt/tang factor than anything else.    My dad was pretty happy with his regular order of wings and the fries were pretty good and crunchy but again... really salty....  I suppose it goes well with the beer.  

Service was attentive aside from our server not being able to guide us toward other beers... and I think the self serve tabletop taps in the bar area are fun (and probably dangerous).    Unfortunately we're unlikely to go back... it just wasn't interesting enough to hold our attention, though it's probably good for game nights and big groups so I'm sure they'll do well."}
{"text":"Wow...service here is very erratic.  Today the kitchen is so slow!  It's lunch time people!!! I've been waiting 20 minutes for street tacos - and it's take out.  This place is not busy today..."}
{"text":"Taco Mac, seems like an Applebee's menu, wings, sandwiches, burgers and salads.  In fact, those are the words out of Billy's mouth. I thought to myself and said aloud, I do not want to eat here. But we were pressed for time and couldn't go anywhere else.  I joked with Billy, watch the food be fantastic, since I was judging it without even trying it. I realize this is not fair, but it totally seemed like a chain restaurant menu.

We ordered a couple of beers off the expansive beer list, where is the Dewey Decimal System when you need it? The beer menu is alphabetical, so if you want to try something new, you have to read the whole column to find the type of beer you would like.  Maybe it should be divided by style, then alphabetical.  No drink specials, booooo.  They only have pint night one week night. We weren't on the right night, so I did not process this information.

Billy ordered chips and salsa and a Monterrey chicken salad.( I was going to a movie so I was just going to eat some of his salad.)

Copied off menu:
Grilled marinated chicken atop crispy romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes, cheddar-jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, black beans, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips.

Surprise surprise, the salsa had a nice kick and the salad was really good. The ranch dressing served with the salad was fattalicious! YUMMY.

Judging from the remarks from other Yelpers, seems like a place, that you might want to avoid at peak hours.  But to meet a friend, sit outside, drink beer and have a snack, I was pleasantly surprised.

Dear Corporate people at Taco Mac, let your servers untuck their 
t- shirts. Please and thank you."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place for the obscenely large beer menu.  We have still yet to try any of their food, but we are members of the Brewniversity where we can drink our way to free merchandise like t-shirts, mugs, and free beer.

I enjoy the layout of this place.  The space is huge and clean and there are special tables in the bar area with beer taps so you can pour your own drafts.  The idea of pouring the drafts is pretty cool but it doesn't work out so well when you have to work kinks out of the taps.  We tried the tap thing once and we kept getting full glasses of pure foam because the tap wasn't adjusted properly.  In the end the waitress worked things out for us and we ended up with a couple free glasses of beer, but it probably wasn't worth all the trouble.

There are tons of tvs so this is a great place to catch a game and work on your Brewniversity credits.  Plus they have a small arcarde room in the back of the restaurant that the hubs and I like to hit up."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn over the taco mac - I love the selection of beers the wings were awesome probably some of the best I've had since living ing Buffalo,NY but everything else was just blah.  Now it was a Monday night so that could be the cause of some of my blah...but stiky menus and an unattentive waiter can definilty put a damper on the experience.
Oh and serving the wrong beers to everyone doesn't make 4 passionate male beer drinker and a one ex-waitress of the Flying Saucer who knows her beers very happy.  Lately I've been very forgiving so I'll definitly give it another shot."}
{"text":"Taco Mac is a typical chain to me but they do have a great selection of beer.  Great place to meet a group of friends and hang out.  We came in on a Saturday night the place was packed but we only waited ten minutes for a table. Our server was very friendly and helpful.  I like the fact that they are serving a lot of local brews and have plenty of others to choose from.  Big surprise to see baked wings on the menu they were really good and still crispy just like the fried ones glad to have some healthier options at a bar."}
{"text":"Hands down the first place I think of to take out of town guest ESPECIALLY if they have dietary restrictions. I cannot say enough nice things about this place and they way they take care of my husband each time we dine and my guest. Several members of my family have extensive allergies and the staff here take the time to explain what is involved in each item and make alterations if needed. Mondays are $3 drafts and Thursday is a free glass! Just go here"}
{"text":"I have been to 3 of these and the university is the WORST!!! I took my family there last night for my birthday dinner and Malachoy was our waiter and he was great! Here is the problem, my Girlfriend ordered Fajitas and the first order came and the meat was so bad she could chew it, Malachoy brought another plate and it was just as bad. At this point we had been there about an hour and my girlfiend did not want to wait for a third try. I asked for a manager and Malachoy came back ten mins later stating he was to busy to come. I got up seeked him out and stated my displeasure and ART asked why did she eat it if it was so bad? I mean really this is customer service???? I threw my bill and the table and left before I said something but I can tell you that being in sales and management for 25 years I would fire this guy on the spot. I know my measly 100 bill probably does not mean a lot to a high profile sports bar but had to let people know what a sham and what an A******** ART is!"}
{"text":"Taco Mac University is a shining example of the fact that craft beer in Charlotte has come far enough that simply having a good brew list is no longer enough to make you shine. You need to bring in in food, service and atmosphere and I hate to say it but they just don't. The place is loud. Not bustling, not \"a little noisy\". LOUD NOISES, loud. The staff is not unpleasant by any means, but they don't wow me with either their personality or awareness.

I do have to say that the Queso Poblano was tasty and definitely an appetizer for 2. I would also be remiss to completely gloss over the beer list. It is massive. Bottles, drafts, big beers, lighter beers, probably even Light beers (but I really didn't check). It's all there and it's all decently priced. For me though, there are are too many better places in town to grab a good beer to make Taco Mac a regular watering hole."}
{"text":"Megan and Tanya gets 5 stars for service. So does the manager Jason. Great food, great drinks, great environment. A+++"}
{"text":"35-cent pints- fantastic promo. Did they even make money on this?? I mean, with some of those drafts on the special they had to be losing anywhere between .40- $1 on each pint..? I don't know, more curiosity than anything else.

I'm glad they came up with such a fresh promo though, they definitely attracted some new clientele, which I feel they needed. 

It really isn't a bad sports bar. The food is fairly decent but I feel it's overpriced in proportion to quality. I'd much rather be at a Saucer or Wild Wing Café. I used to like BWW too but they have since gotten greedy too.

I've been here a handful of times, service definitely could've been better almost every time. 

The beer card definitely comes in handy if you frequent this place. The beer prices are average. I can't recall exactly but I thought I they could've had better specials during the week.

Overall, just such generic bar food. If it was priced better, it would probably be in my top 5 frequent stops on the way home from the office."}
{"text":"Solid. A worthy try if you're close by and want something simple & quick."}
{"text":"Sports bars. Good wings. American style tacos. Lots of televisions. Lots of beers. 

I live upstairs in the condos and order take out from here about once a month. Most notably today when we had this crazy snow storm and everything else was closed. They had limited staff and a limited menu but were still trying to keep up with the crowds. You have to admire that kind of spirit. 

I ordered burgers and a bottle of cab to go and was happy to get that! I had called all over looking for delivery in the snow with no results. So I applaud taco macs for weathering the storm.  

The burgers were great and the cab was ok. I will be back to dine in sometime."}
{"text":"Regular food that took a little while to come out and was still incorrect but the server fixed everything quickly and tvs are literally everywhere!"}
{"text":"Think an overly franchised, corporate version of Fly Saucer.  The good.  140 beers on tap and 200 plus by bottle.  Waiter knew his beers and could make recommendations.  High-tops in the bar area with your vary own taps (2 regulars and 1 seasonal).  Plenty of TVs in a 2 story space so there's not a bad seat in the house for the game.  Foods reasonably priced, most of it was under $10.  The bad.  Burger I had was required to be cooked medium well.  There could be some surprises but I would imagine the rest of the menu is similarly mediocre (the food prices seemed to indicate the quality).  Beer prices weren't great but weren't exorbitant.  Service was acceptable.  Neither impressing nor disappointing.  Shame that its in South Park.  I think it could have a cool neighborhood character if it was in a different part of town (I'm thinking Duckworth's).  Conclusion.  I'd go back for the beer selection and to watch a game.  The taps at the high-tops would make for a fun night with a group of friends (first come first serve unfortunately, no reservation so it's a shot in the dark).  I'd try the wings on the second trip but if they flopped I would probably try and eat before hand.  I'd go again but not necessarily put it on the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Go for the huge beer selection and TVs, not so much for the food. Staff is largely populated by college students who don't seem very knowledgable about the menu in some cases."}
{"text":"Said thanks as we walked out as more waitresses and waiters walked by.... and just stared  I wouldn't go there unless you want to waste your time"}
{"text":"Taco Mac is great! We stopped by last week before a concert at PNC and last minute decided to come here. Our waitress was sweet and attentive and the food was very good for a cheap price!! I'm always skeptical about trying a new place, but this one was yummy and we will return when back in the area. Fun atmosphere and good beer."}
{"text":"The experience has gotten worse each time I have gone, but last night took the cake.

We waited about 5 minutes at the front waiting to be sat. Mind you this was at 9:30 on a Wednesday with no major sporting events scheduled, so it was not full in the least. I would say it was another 5 minutes before we were greeted by the waitress (wiping her nose with her hand as she did so). 

I ordered Wings and my girlfriend chicken tenders which took a solid 30 minutes to arrive. After the food was dropped off, we waited another 20 minutes or so to have our drinks refilled (which were empty at the time the food arrived). After pointing out to her how long we waited for service, she laughed and said she got on a cleaning spree. I'm glad paying customers rank lower than wiping a table off. At this time we also pointed out to the waitress the hair that was found in the food, to which she replied \"oh s***,\" and then asked if we wanted the rest of the food the hair was in before she took it away.  No apology was given, and we tried to find a manager, but we quickly discovered that the lack of attentiveness was not limited to our waitress. 

Our entire meal took about 1 1/2 hours (no apps, no beers, just 10 Wings and some chicken tenders with hair in them). We will not be going back.

Update: I emailed them in response to their comment to this post four hours ago and it seems their customer service is as prompt as their wait staff."}
{"text":"This review is based on a bar visit.  I have never sat in the restaurant.  There are 100-something craft beers on tap.  We had great service, good beers and the chicken nachos were great!"}
{"text":"Pro: draft beer selection. TVs for the games.

Con: they serve terrible food to accompany the beer.

Pro tip: eat before you come."}
{"text":"In general sports bars are placed I avoid, they're generally loud and often have really bad food. The service is typically average and they're usually really rigid about the games they've got on. Taco Mac was nothing like that.

We got there and were immediately greeted and taken to our private room- where the service was perfect. The waitress was attentive without being overbearing and provided a great experience for all the guests. 

I got to try a lot of appetizers and main courses and everything was good - the menu is varied enough you can eat something healthy, much on some flat breads or enjoy some of the amazing dips. They've got a great beer selection and a bunch of high tops with taps built in. 

If you're looking for a place for a private party or to watch a game this place is great."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I eat lunch here a few days a week and burgers and wings are wonderful"}
{"text":"great place to watch the game & grab some drinks.  huge beer selection and tv's are everywhere.  regardless of where you are sitting (or if you are blind as a bat), you shouldn't have a problem viewing the game :)

food is good, it's not a gourmet restaurant by no means, but if you are looking for a gourmet cuisine you probably shouldn't go to a place famous for \"Brewniversity\" and that probably should also be a sign that it's probably not the best place for kids, but i don't have kids so what do i know :)


check it out & cheer on the PANTHERS & the TAR HEELS!!"}
{"text":"Like many of the reviews, my experience was so-so, but I might go back if I have a group that wants to watch the game and grab some beers. The beer selection is obviously great. I came in with my fiance to watch a specific game. The place was basically empty so I told the hostess that we were hoping for a TV to see the Nationals game. She seemed uninterested in that request and apparently just sat us wherever she felt like. So after getting a TV switched, we were able to see the game we wanted. The food was ok... Let's just say I won't go back for the food, but after a few drinks it might look appetizing. Again, the beer selection and the number of TVs is this places saving grace in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not great food, just okay good. My husband got boneless wings and Bleu cheese dressing. The dressing tasted like cheap mayo with some cheese thrown in. When he mentioned it to the manager, he replied with \"I don't know what to tell ya, Man.\"  As he opened one of the containers and stuck his finger in it in front of us. Really kinda rude. 

First and probably last stop here."}
{"text":"The service is horrible because the management is lazy! You get driveby service every 15 mins, if you miss that train wait for the next. The managers do not setup the TVs for football Sunday so it becomes a free for all if you can see your game and when asked they basically give lip service then walk away.  Overpriced and slow and a cluster F.  Do not waste your time here!  One star because there is no way to rate stupid ineptitude!"}
{"text":"I understand that it was a big week for them considering the beer deal they had going on but that is no excuse to be rude to any customers. The lady that was taking names down around 5 PM yesterday was extremely rude. I have worked and still do work in the restaurant industry so I do understand it gets stressful but that was terrible. Our group ended up leaving and telling all of our friends to not go. I will never come back again solely due to the staff. I am obviously not the only person who feels this way considering the terrible reviews so I suggest that they step it up."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has 2.5 stars. We ignored it and tried anyways. The manager on staff convinced us to stay when we got there and found out the table taps weren't working. Apps were mediocre but the worst part was my wedge salad. It was good until my girlfriend noticed a bug in it. I didn't believe it until I looked closer. It was definitely a worm! we brought the issue to our servers attention and her response was \"ohhhh\" no apology and we still paid for the wedge. Nothing to reassure us that they felt bad about the WORM."}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment kind of visit. My hubby had never been but I had about 10 years ago. Our server was Julia and she was awesome. She recommended the queso and and the hickory burger. So good! Please don't pass up the queso. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you want to experience good service, please go to the Southpark location rather than the University location. Food is great, service not so much. Teach the staff about the choices available, rather than making you trying to figure it out own-your-own. Second time here in two years and I realize why I haven't been back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to Taco Mac numerous times for business lunches, happy hours, dinners etc.  I thought it'd be a great place to stop on a Saturday night for a drink after a movie.

We showed up around 10pm and were seated in the bar. We got some beers and then one of my party decided to order food.  That was an interesting experience.  He's allergic to onions, rice and a slew of other things.  It took some bargaining to order a onion-less, rice-less chicken burrito with fries that normally came with rice & beans, without an up charge for changing sides.  The burrito normally comes with tomatoes and lettuce as well.

The food finally arrived, and he began eating the burrito.  A few things were odd, there were no tomatoes or lettuce in the burrito.    We were also expecting only the rice to be replaced, and still get beans and fries - but alas, we only got fries.  NBD - we can deal with that.

However - a few bites in, what did we see? Rice.  After specifically stating allergies of rice and onions, there was still rice.  So now what?  

We bargain again and try to find another item on the menu that we don't think will be an issue to order.  After some searching, he decides that its just not worth it. 

At this point, its 11:30, I'm about to fall asleep and my beer is long done.  I keep seeing our waitress visit her table beside us, and I'm all ready to ask for the check.  She never comes back.  I can't even flag her down if I can't find her... I end up going to the bar and hope that they can track her down.  I wasn't too stoked on how they responded to my question.

Therefore, after at least 20 minutes of waiting and falling asleep at the table, we leave money on the table and bail.  First time I've ever had to do that.

I really hope this is a small, bad experience.  I've had great experience from that server before and very good food from Taco Mac, but it may be a bit until I return..."}
{"text":"POOR MANAGEMENT - It will take forever to be served & the food is ok. We thought it would be different & gave it another try - it wasn't! Had to chase down the Manager after 20min. At least may be the table beside us will be waited on after we told him they had yet to be served too. Not one of the better restaurants (for service) in Huntersville. We left & ended up at LaUnica - service is the best around along with great food!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, poor quality food, but fun sports bar atmosphere. T-Mac has the best selection of Tap beer in Charlotte and a full bar. If you want a few beers and to watch a game it is a great stop, however do not expect to love the food. I have yet to be impressed with any food item at T-Mac. They really should work on the food quality because if they could do food like they do beer they would be tough to beat."}
{"text":"Tons of beer on tap, great wings, and great service. What you would expect a sports bar to be."}
{"text":"Went out with the boys,, Had a great time and great beer selection. The wait staff was on point and the beers came flowing. I would give it 5 stars but the food was good but not great for a south park spot. I will be back and I can bring large parties there with no problem. Over all really happy with everything."}
{"text":"I come here a lot as I live really close by. It's a solid go to spot, but only when you have time to kill. In fact I'm currently sitting at this location and after 2 hours I am just getting food that was order an hour ago. 

The food is actually really good. It makes Hickory Tavern look and taste like a cheap roadside McDonald's in the middle of BFE. Just be prepared to wait your ass off for it.   Of course having 100+ beers on draft is awesome, and delicious wings are great, but not when I have to wait 1 hour to get it.

Advice: MANAGEMENT...Hire more staff, hire better staff, improve processes in general. Try to define the reasons that it's taking people over a reasonable amount of time to get food and drinks."}
{"text":"Very nice looking sports bar. The food was a little bland. The wings were really good. So get the wing! Nachos are huge order. Staff was very nice. Clean which is always good."}
{"text":"Way too many tv's in one place. No matter where you turn BOOM a tv. I went with a friend and we were not impressed. The wings were dry, we barely got refills on our drinks and the waitress couldn't have cared less. Plus it was so loud from the tv volume's fluctuating that it felt like we were screaming at each other!

Needless to say it was an experience and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good beer selection but the service is terrible!  Food is very hit or miss in terms of quality, flavor and quantity.  Plan on taking a while to eat.  Good thing is the number of TVs."}
{"text":"This restaurant has delicious food and brews. The spinach artichoke dip was perfect to share between four people. My party ordered the chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches and we were all satisfies. The chicken was cooked and breaded perfectly, but the homemade ranch was really the best part of the meal! The waitress brought out extra without being asked and she was right on point. The ranch was more reminiscent of a gourmet aioli and I dipped both my chicken and fries in it! Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The place is not called \"Taco Mac\" anymore. It's now \"T-Mac.\" Although they seem to serve the same amount of tacos as before.

Also, one server doesn't have long hair anymore. He cut it. Looks like a different guy, lost his edge.

T-Mac has great televisions. It is the most spacious sports bar around, and they check the IDs of *everyone.* No exaggeration.

Beer flows like wine in this place. There are at least 170,000 taps.

T-Mac seems to understand that people enjoy feeling like they are a part of something bigger than themselves. With this in mind, all patrons over 21 years of age are welcome to \"enroll\" in their \"Brewniversity.\" 

Upon enrolling, you have to be a pledge first. Pledgeship ends after you drink 10 different beers. *NOTE - It is not necessary to do this in one sitting.* You also get a grey t-shirt signifying your new status. After this, you are just like the rest of the worthless souls in the place, free to spend a few hundred dollars in order to get another worthless memento.

Last week, all draft beers were 35 cents. Full pints of draft beer for 35 cents. No limit. Granted, on the nicest day of 2014, their patio wasn't ready. No chairs or tables. Baffling. We stood in the sun, drinking 35 cent beers, which was great.

The new lunch special is underrated. $6.95 for a full color page of options in large fonts. Wraps, burgers, quesadillas, burritos, or the Monterrey Chicken Salad plus a side for $6.95. That's GREAT. You can get T-Mac Chili or Chicken Tortilla soup or fries (maybe vegetables, too?) as a side. The T-Mac Chili heated my tortured psyche on a dank day.

Some people don't like the food here. I tell you, I have enjoyed everything I've tried. Granted, the Shrimp and Avocado Salad was preceded by much hype and it didn't meet expectations. I blame the expectations, because I have been pleased by everything from their tacos to their hostesses.

They have an upstairs room available for events - fantasy football drafts & scrap-booking outings. 

I'll leave T-Mac with this: A sports bar of this size with a full menu should have bigger bathrooms with more stalls and urinals."}
{"text":"Big space, lots of flat screens, and a lovely patio...other than that, nothing else impressed me. 

The food was mediocre at best. The salsa was bland, the veggie quesadilla was boring, and they don't have any drink specials. 

The service was basic...not friendly, but just functional. It seemed even the tvs enticed their own employees because they were watching the games more than focusing on the tables. The one area that service was good was at the hostess station; they gave a warm greeting. 

All in all, unless someone else picks this place to meet up, I'd rather take my business elsewhere to get better food and better service."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Taco Mac randomly. Had a craving for Tacos.. Unfortunately they didn't have the best tacos around. But the environment was perfect for watching many sports games simultaneously. Not really for carrying on conversation. The staff was pleasant and their drinks weren't overpriced. But unless I'm drunk already I might not be able to eat their food again with a satisfied smile on my face. Oh, and don't order the fresh fruit side...."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was horrible on a late Saturday afternoon when there were not many others in the restaurant.  Two kids meals, never got the Oreo that was supposed to come with them.  Might return, probably won't"}
{"text":"Good all-round food and drinks. The wings are good, but they're like $1 each. I hate the idea of paying $1 for a wing, but that's life. The queso con carne is my favorite. This is a great place to have casual food with friends and/or watch a football game. Or basketball. Go Cavs."}
{"text":"This is our second visit and each time the service has been terrible. We have gone 20-40 minutes without seeing a server and our bills each time have included items we did not order. Food is decent but not worth the rest of the hassle."}
{"text":"Forget the food, the beer is amazin! If you love diversity of beer come here, and don't dare order a bud light!! The staff we willing give you samples and have you hooked on beers"}
{"text":"140 beers on tap...awesome!  Baked wings...not too bad.  Tons of TVs...necessary for a sport's bar.  Service...pretty solid.  Fish tacos...excellent, a real surprise."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are looking for a quiet, intimate, romantic meal.  Beer, wings, and sports.  That's what you get here.  
We came for the Carolina Panthers playoff game and sat at the bar.  The wings were excellent, the beer was cold, and the TVs were big ('Murica!).  On this particular day, that was just about perfect.
Service was a bit of an issue.  Not because our servers were unattentive or rude, but because the layout of the bar doesn't lend itself to efficient service.  For example, the beer glasses are at the extreme ends of the bar.  If you are sitting in the middle of the bar (as we were), the server has to go at least 10 steps to get a glass.  In the bartending business, that is a mile.  Additionally, as in most restaurants, the bar is responsible for all carry out orders.  On big game days, this is almost a full time job for one of the bar tenders.  I would have liked to have seen an additional bartender to take care of the bar patrons or house orders.

This will be my Charlotte destination for beer and wings.  It should be yours, too."}
{"text":"The baked lemon pepper wings were awesome!  There wasn't very much socialization there though."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Staff was pleasant. Good selection of craft beer. A lot of TVs for sports invents. Great place in the back for parties."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews here and I HATE sports bars. The beer selection is unparalleled. And no, it's not expensive- for instance- I get the Big Boss Aces and Ates here, but if I bought it at, let's say Total Wine, just by itself for a 12oz it's $4.99. It's all relative. I go here for the beer, they do specials, and I'm in the Brewniversity club.....So I can track what I drink and get rewarded for doing so. I even lost my Brewniversity card, shot Taco Mac Inc an email and same day customer service said they had one in the mail to me. BAM! Good stuff. I've had their chicken fingers (good), Turkey BBQ sammy (yum), chicken nachos (double yum)...I don't go here for the Mexican food, but I can't say I've had it here either. My husband, on occasion with a larger group, will splurge on the wings, which he says are delish and you can get them in range of \"hotness.\" Try it out and don't be a square drinking Bud Light drinker. And by the way, if you drink beer at this establishment and get a Miller, Busch, Bud Light- you should be kicked in the balls."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and the food is good, but the service is less than par. They have a lot of craft beer options on tap. I just wish the service was better."}
{"text":"I have visited this Taco Mac as well as the Taco Mac near South Park serveral times.  This was by far the worst service experience I have had to date.   I believe that several of the other reviewers are correct that it has a lot to do with the proximety to UNCC.   If your party has more than four people, there are better options in the area.  The beer selection is awesome, riveling only the flying saucer in the area.  The food is mediocre at best, incidently it seems better and bigger portions at the south Charlotte location.  Overall, avoid the place if you can."}
{"text":"Trying to be a hip sports bar but, reeks of a corporate restaurant.  Vanilla is a good word.  12$ margarita in the country nowhere North Carolina?  I got the strawberry, however, I think she gave me blackberry.   Not very fresh, more like a fruit mix NOT fresh squeezed and NOT worth 12 bucks!   I got the bland street chicken tacos with a thimble of a Mexican corn salsa.  The food was an unseasoned joke.  We left to go to another bar.  This place is going through the motions.  No passion.  They do not care."}
{"text":"I was SO looking forward to eating here, and when I finally did, it was a HUGE letdown! I had the Burrito covered in cheese, and first off, it was small. Not what you expect at a Sports Bar. And more importantly, and unfortunately, it was BLAND! This certainly was NOT Cotija cheese which is flavorful and salty, similar to parmesan. Was probably white American cheese. And the meat inside was chewy and bland. I do not associate Mexican food with Bland, but Taco Mac seemed to achieve this dubious honor. 

My friends ordered Nachos for the table. Sure, there was lots of it, but about 90% chips. The beef was ultra fine and bland. Where's the heat? There were a few jalepeno's but they were dry! Must have been sitting out too long to lose flavor like that.

The boneless Buffalo wings were decent, but also lacked the punch I love with traditional Buffalo Wings.

The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the awesome Beer selection. If it didn't, I'd have given this 1 star. But they really do have a tremendous selection of beers, 140 on tap! And about 100+ bottle available too.

Certainly a rowdy place to watch a game as it does get very, very crowded and LOUD!

So IF you want Great BEER, then you'll love this place. If you're expecting good food, SKIP it."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in Lake Norman. Have been waiting 2 hours for food. People at our table that ordered 1 hour after us received their food before us and the order was wrong. Takes 30-35 to get a drink refill. Will never return."}
{"text":"I've only gone here on game days. It's your typical over crowded, long wait to be seated sports bar. Food is actually decent and the wait staff is friendly. I usually go with the flat wings and their loaded sweet potato fries. Haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"So the much anticipated Taco Mac is finally open in Charlotte. I have heard so much (good and bad) about this chain, so I decided to find out for myself.

The place has a typical chain restaurant, sports bar appeal. Lots of TV's, if there is a game on you should be able to find it on one of the TV's. When you first approach the place you see all of the outdoor seating, which is nice if you are not interested in the sports bar scene inside. Once you walk in you see that the place is huge. Tons of seating, some of the tables have taps at the table. There is also an upstairs seating area. The place is very chain restaurant esque.

The service was slow and not overly friendly. I don't know if the place was understaffed when I was there or if they are still getting used to thier jobs as the place has only been open for a couple of weeks.

The menu was OK, nothing special, but not bad either. Reminds me of a Ruby Tuesday or TGI Fridays. I ordered a burger and fries, and had no complaints. The beer menu us huge (140 taps), an awful lot of those taps are devoted to Macro. Really there were only a couple of taps that I was really impressed with. 

This place was not bad, but I think Duckworths is still the best beer destination in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Taco Mac in Atlanta. The food here in Charlotte is OK. The one star is based on the service. I have never had good service and have been at least a half dozen times. I would choose someplace else but it is so close to my office and there are not as many good options to watch sports and drink beer. 

Six of us arrived at 4:00. We were told to seat ourselves.  After 10 minutes I asked if there was service in the bar area. Five minutes later we were brought menus.  We ordered beers.  We then ordered guac and chips. The food came a few minutes later. Still no beers. Finally beers arrived after 30 minutes of waiting. We were told there was only one bartender and one waitress. This was during March Madness. Poor planning. 

The bill came and the \"March Madness\" pitcher special was not recognized on the bill. Waitress did adjust after I pointed this out to her."}
{"text":"To start, I have been here several times and there has never been a host waiting at the host stand. I always have to wait a few minutes before someone acknowledges me. One time we went and we waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. We ended up handing our menus back after the 15 minutes to go somewhere else due to a time constraint. 

The wait staff are all friends and pay no attention to the patrons. There can be 3 other tables at the restaurant and you will still have extremely slow service. You will also find the staff smoking on your way out after your meal. 


Honestly the beer selection is good, but it's really not worth a trip here. It's also priced higher than other sports bar in the area. We come here because it's the only sports bar walking distance from our place. Moving soon though and won't be back to TMac ever again."}
{"text":"Taco mac was a lot better than I remembered from my last visit. You can eat fairly healthy here (if you want to) with several meal sized salads with interesting ingredients. Lunch portions are really generous with side options including premium options.This place was completely dead during the lunch hour and service, while friendly was pretty absent. There aren't many options in this area and Taco Mac can accommodate a crowd. And you can mix and match three tacos of your choice."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: sports type 

Service: our service was excellent .and our waiter Ashanti was awesome. She was very knowledgeable about the  soft drink mixers and the menu. You can really tell that she loves her job. She was happy and made our experience rememberable.

Food : the food was normal .nothing over the top. Its what you can expect from a taco bar. I ordered the shrimp and guacamole wrap with a side of sweet potato fries.

Prices $"}
{"text":"Service is slow and the help looks lost  and confused the prices are high since the food is fair at best and cold. Long wait for food that is not worth it. Go somewhere  else"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! Their quesadillas (minus the onions. Too many onions). I strongly recommend trying them!!!"}
{"text":"Bleh. That's the only word I can use to describe this place. The food is Bleh. The waitstaff is Bleh. The atmosphere is confusing and Bleh. It looks as it should be a nice bar with a full service kitchen but the marketing as a family restaurant muddles that. The lighting is harsh which makes you want to have a drink and go instead spending time socializing. I wish I could say something positive about the food but, I've never had anything good here. Tacos are not the focus at this establisment and neither is mac and cheese. In my opinion that perfectly describes this sham restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is terrible!!!!  U will wait forever just to get a drink .  food was alright......burger one guest had was way over cooked, other food was good.  Overall, they need note servers and we would have been much more pleased!"}
{"text":"Really Taco Mac... Queso con Carne for 9 bucks and this is what you get... Barely enough for 5 chips. This what going to be split between 3 people. Guess we each get a little taste... Didn't know it was Tapas"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Genuinely.  My last visit changed all of that.  Horribly awful slow service.  Thought my wings were lackluster.  Tortilla chips stale.  At prime time on a Friday evening you'd expect this place to be buzzing with activity, but was probably half full.  Apparently others have concluded the same thing.  The awful service last night has me crossing this one off of my dining rotation.  I predict this place closes down within 6 months.  Sometimes when you dine at a place that was once great but has fallen off the wagon, you just get a sense."}
{"text":"I miss Taco Mac so much.. I am pretty upset that there's not one in Florida! I hope they plan to open more locations.

A pure one of a kind restaurant with an amazing selection of food and beer. The location is located in University City and it is definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in the Charlotte area.

There has to be at least 100 TV's - perfect for watching Sunday night football. This is a sports bar people, please don't complain about the noise level because Bars aren't really supposed to be quiet. If you find a quiet bar, let me know. 

The wait usually isn't long, the times I've been here I waited for no longer than 5-10 minutes. The service here is great, I never had an empty soda and the wait staff was attentive to our needs. 

I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked exactly how I liked it and really was a great burger. The fries were delicious, too. 

All in all, I say CHECK THEM OUT! Taco Mac is a great restaurant and I miss them dearly! Come to Florida!!!"}
{"text":"I made a mistake.  I went to an amazing beer place and college sports fanatic dream hang out for tacos.  The tacos were sub-par and inconsistent with other reviews.  For that reason, I'll withhold judgment on the food.  As for the beer and atmosphere, I'm ready to relive some memories.  Good food, they say, helps you relive a memory.  So does sticky floors and the smell of left over beer.  When I walked into Taco Mac, I could swear I discovered a long lost fraternity brother who followed his franchisee dream.  I wish there was a Taco Mac at Penn State when I was there.  With a beer selection second to none and tables with taps built into them, this is a college sports bar that has been misplaced."}
{"text":"Ugh I had really high hopes for T Macs (I love a good sports bar), but after three visits I'm done. This location's service is horrible! The first time we came we had slow service, but the food made up for it (buffalo hummus is on point). The other two times our service was bad and half of our orders came out wrong. Plus it took nearly 15 minutes to get our beers, which come on people!! The last time time we came was not by choice- we were visiting a friend. When we arrived we were told a 25 minute wait and half of the restaurant was empty. When we were seated, we sat in a table that was open from the get go. And of course our service was horrible again- we even had to get the manger in order to get a server... Never again."}
{"text":"I'm convinced this place is only still in business because of location. Service has been terrible every single visit. I've given this location 3 chances and I have been disappointed each time. During my third and last visit, I tried to call in my to go order while driving in that direction. No one answered. When i got there I placed my to go order at the bar. Wasn't too busy, and there were plenty of employees walking around cleaning than assisting customers OR answering the phones. While waiting for my order, I saw the bartender purposefully let the phone ring off the hook, to only grab it, answer and hang it up just to get it to stop ringing. So that explained a lot. 
This place has got to do better."}
{"text":"Ok, so was on the way back to the hotel (really) when I passed Taco Mac, of which I was unfamiliar. Being a curious sort, in the mood for wings, I flipped a B in the middle of WT Harris and have say I'm impressed: pretty much every table/booth has its own huge flatscreen hanging from the ceiling. They have 100+ draught and 115+ bottled. And to cap it off, alongside MNF, the tv on the far right was showing a replay of the England/San Marino WC qualifier... I think I'm in love. Waiting on the wings for final verdict...

Ok, a couple days later. Still like the place. Turns out its a pretty well-known chain down south, I'd never heard of it. The wings were OK, not great, not awful (I had wings more to my taste at the Flying Saucer the following night). So, I'm sticking with 4-stars, would be a great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! Ashley was a sweetheart and a great server. We will definitely watch more 49ers games here! (Love how they change the station at your table)"}
{"text":"Parking is very difficult to get.  I need to say that again: this place gets busy and the parking lot gets packed.  I had to circle around a few times one night to find a single space.

My friends love this place - they have the loyalty card that gets them larger beer mugs than us occasional visitors.  I think you need to buy 100 different beers to move up.

The food is standard for bar food.  I did enjoy my chicken fingers.  I am usually a blue cheese eater but here there was no flavor to the cheese.  Very bland.  The ranch dressing was the surprise winner here.  I order ranch dressing here and blue cheese everywhere else.

The beers are great - but not always in stock.  I have had at least one beer I ordered (first or second pick) every time that was out.  I wish this didn't keep happening because it is disappointing.  With such a huge menu it is not easy picking a beer out of the myriad beers.  Once you do it is that beer that you want.

Flying saucer is similar to this place.  The trend has continued for there to be far greater choice than ever before.  This is a macro trend so I think T-Mac or Taco Mac, however you say it, is an average specimen of these types of bars.

I am a tough grader so you may think of this place as a 4, but you really have to wow me in some way to get more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I do not come here and I go to other sports bars. Taco Mac has the best TV's but the food is so so. 
I think 3 stars is all they need to receive, I mean the service was inconsistent either on top of you or where did they go? We asked twice for utensils and finally received them on the 3rd time. We couldn't hear the sound for the panthers game and we asked the server and she gave us a bogus reason that \"it has to be low so that we can hear the customers\". But I told her I can hear conversations at tables around me but not the game. Finally in the second quarter they turned up the volume, mind you people come hear to watch and listen to the games. I think they forgot to turn up the volume because other customers were complaining too. 
I would suggest that the managers need to start checking in with the customers and use their common sense on why people are in the restaurant. C'Mon man!"}
{"text":"I work across the street, so me and some co-workers walked over one nice day for lunch.  The patio was half full so we sat outside, which was nice.  It didn't seem that busy but I guess the inside was with the beginning of March Madness.  But it showed in how painfully long it took our food to arrive.  No joke, 40 minutes for a table of burgers and fries!!  I don't fault our server because obviously she doesn't cook the food.  However, she really could have acknowledged it better.  It almost seemed like she avoided our table for a while instead of just a quick apology to let us know the kitchen was backed up.

The food was pretty good.  I enjoyed my burger with sautéed mushrooms and onions.  I upgraded to the sweet potato fries but they were meh.  Prices were good though.  If it wasn't for the time constraint of an hour lunch break and the slow food, it would have been fine.  But I might come later next time to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Fish tacos - flat

Draft beer at my table - flatter

Service - dude, don't try so hard...you creeped me out.

I'll visit a locally owned bar next time."}
{"text":"Very cool for a game day. I was visiting from Tulsa, OK and was deeply enthralled by the tap tables. WOW! Fabulous idea! 
I had the buffalo chicken tacos and they were darn good! Lots of TV's and great service!"}
{"text":"Let me first start out with a few positives.  They have a very good beer selection.  Some of the tables in the bar area have their own taps.  The food is pretty good, but a little overpriced.  The fries are excellent.  They also have a ton of TVs.

Now let's get to the service.  I've been there 3 or 4 times and the service is consistently terrible.  Maybe it's their proximity to UNCC, but whatever it is they need to get it fixed.  In my most recent visit we were seated for 5 minutes before a server ever came over.  I had to ask for a beer menu.  They have over 100 beers, why don't they just give you a beer menu with the regular menu?  My beer was almost empty when our food arrived and I quickly finished it once I started eating.  I didn't see our server again until after I was finished eating then she asked me if I wanted another.  I told her no, just a check.  She said she would get it and bring my daughter her oreos.  After another 10 minutes went by we finally got the check and of course, no oreos.  Needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Drink selection is always awesome. Wait staff are sometimes friendly but ALWAYS slow. Food is overpriced and never that good. I work in the building next door so I visit by default with coworkers on occasion. However, if all you care about is beer and watching sports, this is perfect for you."}
{"text":"I came here for the beer. The food is average. Typical bar food with a restaurant attached. I was interested in the Brewniversity which I joined on my first visit & immediately threw myself into earning a degree.

I will return but only for the beer & maybe an appetizer or two."}
{"text":"As others have said, great beer selection although somewhat pricey. Food is really mediocre especially given it's location. I will go watch a game and have a beer but I eat before I go ;)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and have yet to try their food. But quite frankly, they could probably serve poop on a plate and get away with it. Maybe not, but you come here for beer, sports watching, and then food. They have enough beer to make me a happy camper and tvs at every angle featuring every game. Don't bring someone here expecting him/her to focus on your conversation.  

Another big plus was they were eagerly willing to allow beer samples so you didn't get stuck with a new beer that didn't agree with your beer buds. 

We sat at one of the tap tables and initially it was kind of a huge disappointment, but they fixed it to get the beer flowing as it should. They also have a beer club like the Flying Saucer, however there is no charge to join this one. i forget the perks, but if i lived closer it'd be pretty cool. 

They do have a mini game room tucked in the back and yes they do have Big Buck Safari if that is a necessity like it was for us this past weekend."}
{"text":"Beer selection is very nice. My only complaint is they never have a beer on special...ever. Sure, you get a pint glass on Thursday if you come at the right time, but a discounted brew of the day would go a long way for making me return more than once a year. 

My roasted wings were actually pretty good, although the Three Mile Island roasted was not very hot...not sure if it is just because they were roasted or that the sauce just wasn't very hot. It turned out to be delicious, but i was actually looking for more burn on this night. 

Service was fine, although i would've ordered a 2nd beer, but she never looked my way or offered before offering the check. i would think a place with this much beer would expect someone to have more than one beer or at least offer. 

Definitely a great spot for sports. Sat in a booth and while you have one tv directly above the people across from you, the tvs are situated perfectly where you can watch the tv at the next booth as well. If those don't have what you want, turn to your left or right and it will probably be on there."}
{"text":"Awesome beer and food selection. I'm originally from Western New York so I am very picky when it comes to my wings. Taco Mac does not disappoint! Whether I order out or eat in, the food is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Great service ! We had a private event here where we reserved the top room that easily held our group of about 40 people. Our waiter, Jordan, was so organized on top of things! I really appreciated that. We did not wait long to order and the food came out fast as well. I appreciate a restaurant that prepares in advance for their private groups. You can tell they had extra staff on hand in the kitchen because the food came out as if it was a party of 4. I do recommend this place for group events if you want to do something because it was easy to get and upstairs so away from the main crowd. Request for Jordan to be your waiter! He did his job well. Food was excellent as well for a wing spot and prices were good. The wings are not amazing but they are good."}
{"text":"Good food and amazing beer selection but terrible service.  I've been to Taco Mac twice and twice I've been very disappointed with the wait staff.  The first time I went I was the last person of my group to arrive and I had to ask the server three times for a glass so I could have a beer off the pitcher my friends were already drinking.  Then the server messed up our order and blamed us.  Finally, she asked us to pay our tab so she could leave.  On my second visit I suspect our server was also trying to leave because as soon as we were done eating he asked us how we wanted our check split up.  Never mind the fact that no one asked for the check and we were going to stay and have a couple more beers.  We were all so annoyed we nixed the beers and left."}
{"text":"This is a very laid back sports bar type atmosphere. Their food is awesome and you get great portions for the price. 

They have awesome drink deals and have an incredible selection of beer on draft. Would definitely go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo burger cooked 'medium' and it was cooked perfectly. Juicy and very pink. I did not like their signature buffalo sauce whatsoever, but the rest of the burger was great. Skip the zucchini side, it was alright but nothing to write home about. Good beer list, and the chicken nachos looked delicious. TVs playing football all over the place. I wouldn't come here again just because there are so many other options in Charlotte, but it was a solid 3."}
{"text":"So, there are a few things that are very appealing about this place.  It has an enormous beer selection, both bottles and drafts.  And there are more Charlotte beers available here than almost anywhere I've seen, outside of NoDa.  There areTVs... everywhere.  We were at a booth and had a 30-something inch flat screen on the wall literally right in our faces.  Every booth has this same situation going on.  I love beer, and I love TV, so all was well there.

Everything else is average at best.  The food is your typical bar food and there is absolutely nothing special or interesting about it.  And while the idea of having a million beer options is awesome, it doesn't make a difference how many they have if you can only get one because the wait staff is not very attentive.  It is worth noting that there are some tables with built-in beer taps which would seem to offset the dicey wait staff situation.

Bottom line, this place was okay.  The appeal is the sheer number of beers available.  If your favorite beer is not offered in most bars, you may be able to find it here.  Otherwise, it's really not worth venturing into South Park for this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to IKEA, and honestly I didn't have any of the service issues that people described. We ordered a decent amount of wings and it came out at an alright pace. The staff was nice and kept up with my water guzzling ways--pretty much my only requirement. The wings were pretty good, though I think the dry rubs were probably my favorite, because the outside was crispy. Pretty standard wings, pretty standard flavors. What we did enjoy was the beer selection. Found a sour that I really like there, which I later bought a 6-pack of at a beer shop in Durham. The Dragon's Milk is also pretty good and it was a part of a pretty decent stout flight. That's what brought an otherwise 3-stars up to a 4. I'm always happy at a place with solid beers."}
{"text":"My wife and I were riding around looking for a place to grab some food last night. We stumbled upon Taco Mac by mistake while turning around. I was never aware of this place being stuck back here. The parking lot was full of cars, so I gave into my curiosity and talked my wife into giving it a shot with me. 

Upon walking it, it has a sports bar vibe. Lots of TVs, a great looking bar and tables full of people. When I say lots of TVs, I mean more TVs than I've ever seen in one building outside of an electronics store. Seems like there is a TV for each person to watch. I didn't mind it at all, I love watching sports while eating. 

My wife and I both went with the boneless wings. I was curious about the death flavor, but we stuck with hot. The wings were good, a bit bready, but overall tasty. One part that caught me off guard was the homemade dressings. The ranch was really thick and creamy, I enjoyed the flavor though. We had fries with the wings and they were hot and tasted good as well. 

One thing I really enjoyed about this place is the beer selection, our server explained the beer club to us and that sounded pretty cool. I sampled a few local brews ( I can't recall the names ) and they went down smooth. My wife was driving so she had sweet tea. 

For our first experience here, it was overall a very good time. The service was nice and quick. The food was hot and fresh, and the prices weren't too bad. I would recommend this place to anyone in the University area looking to try something new. It's worth a shot, I know we will come back to try out some other menu options. 

( While filling out the additional survey options for this place, one of the options was Has TV:  I had to laugh out loud at this one. )"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me for wings. Horrible wings, bad food, one member in our party found hair in his food & another got sick. 

This was at the Huntersville location.

Never again."}
{"text":"Our server was pleasant but things definitely got off to a rough start with our dinner visit. We ordered drinks and my gram's sweet tea was awful, it wasn't even unsweetened iced tea, it was watery and gross. The server did take it back and brought her a new one a few minutes later that was much better. My mother ordered a mixed drink that didn't come out as described but the server was quick to replace and did not charge for it. I was surprised that they did not have any happy hour specials. We all ordered our food and everyone was happy with it. You also get a good quantity of food for the price. Overall an alright visit, might go again but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Went with a group.   Very good, attentive service from the wait staff.  Pretty typical sports bar with numerous TVs etc.   had appetizers as well as a burger for dinner.  Nothing unique about it, but definitely nothing wrong with it either.   I would recommend it."}
{"text":"So it's Thursday night and there are some GREAT college football games on TV (2 sets of top ten teams playing) and you want to go have some dinner and drinks and watch the games.  Taco Mac should be a great choice.  It is a big sports bar/restaurant with like hundred tvs.  Well, think again....

We had a dozen tvs right around us.  We pleaded with the waitress for an hour to get one of them changed to the big college football game.  She kept telling us that the managers were all really busy.  Now, I understand that the restaurant was busy for evening.  They were on a wait and the place was packed.  But I guarantee you half of those people there were coming in to see the college football games on TV!  It is just crazy to me that they only had the big games showing on a handful of TVs in the place.  Not to mention we never got a tv near us changed as requested - and we were there for 3 hours.  Never.

Besides that, the hostess was rude to me after I requested to move to a booth that opened up near us, telling me that there were people on the wait.  She offered no other solution, just basically told me no.   

I have been to this Taco Mac dozens of times.  Unless you get wings, the food is just okay.   I tried the new flatbread \"pizza\" which was basically a semi-crispy flour tortilla with some tomato and cheese.  Umm, no.  And I typically like the queso poblano, but when it was delivered to us this time is was cold and hard.   We were so hungry we ate it anyways.  

In conclusion, I keep going back to Taco Mac because it is a convenient sports bar in SouthPark.  But the truth is it just isn't that good.  

At least our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I first experienced Taco Mac in Atlanta with a friend and was pumped when one opened in Charlotte in 2010. They are well known for their wide-ranging draft and bottled beer selection, as well as for their chicken wings. The Brewniversity program allows you to earn credits and free gear for trying different beers. In South Park, the service is a weak three stars, but I typically sit at the bar where the service is better and the bartenders will always entertain a conversation. Four stars for the food and five stars for the beer selection."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Taco Mac in South Park, but swung through here on my way home earlier this week. They have a \"Brewniversity\" program where you earn credits for trying different beers, so I usually just go to relax, watch sports and kick back a couple frosty beverages.

The University Taco Mac is smaller than the South Park location, but still has a great selection of different beers on draught, in cans, and in bottles. I sat at the bar and it definitely took a while to get noticed. The bar wasn't especially busy, but there was only one bartender, Megan, working for some reason. Had no problem with the service necessarily, more of a problem with the staffing. Food was great and beer was cold. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had a really cool experience here after a long day at work.  I walked from my hotel with the intention to get something fast and go but then the magic happened.  I walked up to the bar saw some of the hugest, clearest, big screen hi-def TVs everywhere and the middle seat of the oversized bar was open.  

On the main screen they had my beloved Yankees scoring 8 runs in the 3rd inning over Detroit, another tv had Broncos playing the Texans, and another tv had men's  USA basketball......I had to sit down.  I wanted to try something new so I ordered the rotisserie  wings with the new cracked pepper cayman flavor.  If you like spicy then this is the flavor for you - it has a great taste with a spicy kick.  I was not proud of this moment when my nose started running but the wings were so good that I didn't even bother to pick my napkin up to wipe my nose until all of my wings were finished (I have provided my before and after pics of my food).  It was not a good screen but I didn't care who was looking.

On another note, this place is know for their great selection of beers on tap......and I ordered a sweet tea - lame!!!

I definitely will have to come back every time I am in town."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Taco Mac in Atlanta and my experience at this location was mediocre at best. Walking in, of course they have tvs on everywhere, but the volume was insanely loud. And you still couldn't understand what they were saying on the tv with everyone in the restaurant talking. Our waitress came around and we ordered some queso. It took a while to come out and she told us it would be on the house. When we started eating it, it wasn't hot enough at all. Almost rubbery. But we didn't want to complain because she told us it was free. We got our entrees and they were fine, but nothing special. What you would expect from food at a sports bar. When we got the bill, we were charged for the queso that we were told was on the house. At that point we were ready to leave and didn't want to deal with it anymore or argue over getting free food. We probably won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waitress didn't get anything right.  Long wait to get food.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here once after a wedding.  I was in the wedding and most of the wedding party and younger guest went to grab some drinks and food after the reception.  First thing I wanted was a cold beer after all that had gone on that evening... It took forever to get the attention of one of the three bartenders. Now don't get me wrong I know my way around a bar, but this was ridiculous.  It was literally 30 mins. to get a beer.  If I had not been there with a wedding party I would have left.  So my next thought was to order 2 beers to avoid the 30 min fiasco.  Nope! They needed the ID of the person the second beer was for, so I showed him my ID again.  They would not sell me two beers at once. I was there with all people that were over age and I was 27 at the time, it was not like I was sneaking them out the back to underage kids in the parking lot.  I have never had bar service that bad, and I have been in a lot of bars....  The food service was no better,  I would not go back here if I was paid to. Stay Away!!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for a nice night out and to get some grub! So let me first say this, they have a lot of televisions. Everywhere you sit, you will be guaranteed to get a screen. And also, be warned the floors are very slippery so when you come in don't run!

My friends ordered food and I'm going off of their reactions to the food. They ordered a bacon burger, chicken caesar wrap, and a chocolate chimi. The reactions were that even though the entrees were good, they weren't worth it because they didn't get full! However the desserts had better reactions and this is what they said: \"it was bangin.\"

My friend who also ordered the wrap also said that when you see on the menu the fresh fruit for sides, they meant apple slices not extravagant all types of fruit to eat.

Overall, it's not bad yet it's not amazing. Prices aren't ridiculous but they could be a little better."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, polite wait staff. What more could you ask of a wing joint?"}
{"text":"It's a sports bar chain just like the rest. Nothing really makes it stand out above the rest. The service was friendly and the manager makes rounds to every table in case there are any issues. But the shrimp guacamole wrap was much better than expected."}
{"text":"5 Star Craft beer selection, 5 Star Sports TV's everywhere, 5 Star Sports Atmosphere!!!!!

4 Star service.

Bring down to 3 Star is the food.  Really?  Yes, really.  But, 3 Star is A-OK.  Right?  

People keep in mind this is typical sports bar food.  Not necessarily bad, not good, just right in the middle.  It would be hard to compare Taco Mac with Fox and Hound or Hickory Tavern, they are all about the same --- but I do like Taco Mac's craft selection better, also, they actually have beer specials --- which are none existent at the other two joints.

On a Saturday, this place was full of college football-a-holics.   That is why we went, alive with energy!!!!  We had a blast, put down some beer and ate decent wings........  If you want awesome food, go to Dillworth, but prepare to pay twice as much."}
{"text":"Went in at around ten on a Wednesday (they close at 11) for a quick dinner after work with some friends. We stood awkwardly at the door for a few minutes waiting to get sat.. We debated seating ourselves and then we saw someone running over. The drink order took forever, we ordered and we waited until 5 minutes to 11 before our food was finally brought out. I ordered another beer and I could see it was sitting waiting to be brought to us and we were the only table in the place at this point but the servers focus was on closing up and obviously not on us. The food was great, I got a wrap and fries, they had a huge selection of beer as always and an updated list of what was available. The service is what killed the experience for us. What should've been a quick thing turned into almost an hour and a half."}
{"text":"I have dined at Taco Mac 3 times now and it only get worse each visit. I am not sure if I will go again and it's not that the food is the worst it's the service. My last visit was on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't crowded but the service was the worse. I ordered the wings which were fine but I waited 45 mins for the order to come out. I watched at the server was spending all their time getting beer for others from the bar and not taking care of us. It only got worse when it was time to pay the bill and had to wait another 10 mins for him to come but close enough to get their attention that I needed to leave. I enjoy dining out and I always love to give a compliment on good service but this was terrible. If you want beer and have all day to drink I guess this place is happening place but if you want to get in and out try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The stars are right. But I didn't pick it. We we're there for a birthday. There were 10 of us, not showed up at the same time starting at 7:30. They were not busy at all on a Saturday night, now I know why.  It took about 15 minutes to get drinks after ordering or longer on reorders. Two of us had the Buffalo chicken sandwich. While very large both were very dry and stringy. Very hard to bite and eat as a sandwich. Coleslaw tasted very old. And that was it's only taste. Shrimp tacos were a hit. Nachos not so much. And the place was about empty. Maybe 2 stars are to many."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We have been coming here for awhile now since it's within walking distance from our hotel. The service only continues to get worse.  Ordered several drinks and 15 minutes later, no drink.  Asked the waiter and he said he would check, 5 minutes later no drink but states they ran out of 2 different types of vodka I asked for.  Finally got my drink about 10 minutes later.  We placed our order for food with several of us ordering wedge salads.  You would think these would come out pretty quickly, well we were wrong.  2 came out first, 1 about 15 minutes later and one 15 minutes after that and one never even came to the table.   The rest of the food came out in long drawn out spurts.  Waiter was unapologetic and not even concerned for the wait.  So many other places to eat in SouthPark, so my recommendation is to eat and drink somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I am not too impressed by this place. The only reason I keep coming back is there large beer menu, other than that there food is just average. The wings are the best choice, avoid burgers unless your not picky."}
{"text":"A part of the Dirty South right here(ATL)....in the Dingy South(CLT)....

So we meet again Taco Mac. What a pleasant surprise that after all these years, you found me again. You know I cannot resist your delicious wings and far &wide selections of beer. Yes, beer the nectar of the god(s). 

TM is a chain founded in Atlanta, GA. Yes, they are internationally known for having over 145+ beers on tap. Some very cool things, you can join their university and get a PHD in beer. Why wasn't this offered back when I was in college!? Kids today have it made. I have had many types of wings over the years and think TM has the best of them all. I highly recommend to get them swimming which means they come \"swimming\" in sauce. It is a $.50 charge but worth every drop. 

This is by far the largest TM of them all. What a way to make a splash in Charlotte and in South Park no less. I sat at the bar to catch some of the games. So my service was pretty fantastic. I had about four bar keeps waiting on me. I was impressed that they carded everyone which is a great habit. 

On this visit, I went with the Wings (Hot/Swimming) and fries with a pint of Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale. I was definitely feeling the arrival of fall with college football on the telly and pumpkin ale in the belly. 

If you have beer, sports and wings on your mind then I would say give Taco Mac a try!"}
{"text":"If you like beer selection...def worth checking out...but the food is meh.  I have tasted a bunch of their apps and went for lunch,  I have to say, I felt sick the rest of the day.  The place is huge but pretty crowded.  Can't say I would ever go back"}
{"text":"Well, I'm vegetarian so my reviews of the food are lacking. I usually just get a grilled cheese or cheese dip. They are both delicious but I don't think any meat-loving adults would care much about either. They do, however, have an incredible number of TVs. I think I counted between 75 and 150 last time I went. There's always something to watch. The service is great. And they have a pretty decent beer selection for a chain restaurant. I go to the Flying Saucer for beer a lot and they have about 1/2 - 2/3 the selection of the Saucer, which is still quite impressive. I'm not big on the food there but the Brewniversity club does have its perks (free stuff, mainly). The food is pretty decent bar food, there's plenty of beer and there are plenty of TVs. Definitely my kind of place if it werent for the food prices."}
{"text":"The service was worse than awful, if that's a thing. Myself and my manager came around 11:45am and sat outside on the patio, as it was a gorgeous day.

We were greeted semi-quickly - I'd say five minutes or so and our server promptly took our drink order. It took quite a while for us to get our drinks but I will admit that I think our server had been double, maybe triple sat... so he may have gotten a little bit in the weeds.

We put in our order when he dropped off our drinks and still had not received food FIFTY minutes later. No apology from our server until we asked for the check since we had to be back at a meeting at 1PM. The manager never came by to try to remedy the situation either.

We paid in cash, and our server said he would check one last time to see if our food was in the window. Five minutes later, nothing. He had to give us our money back and we left starved.

Apparently they were super busy inside... somewhere... although I only saw one table in there but whatever. Maybe there was a 50 top upstairs hiding that I was unaware of.

Anyway, server was nice but not very apologetic. We went back to the meeting without lunch and were put in a pretty sour mood. We will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"When Tacomac opened, I loved it. The atmosphere and food was great. But they have surely taken a nose dive.  Nowadays, the amount of food on the plates is laughable for the price, and there were no garnishes or sides worth making it memorable. The place seemed dirty like a bar and not clean like a restaurant.  The service was not bad, but just seemed ok.  There was a new manager that said that he was new there and had been brought in from one of their other locations to work through some issues.  He was a nice guy and genuinely seemed concerned. For the sake of the owners and people, I sure hope he can get the job done, otherwise Tacomac will be faltering just like its neighbor Birkdale Golf Course. I sure wont go back for a while."}
{"text":"Super cool place .. really accommodating to all sports fans .. the food was good. It is a great environment for Panthers games if you do not want to be downtown with all the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"Keep pounding...wings and beer? Yes, that's exactly what you do when you find yourself at T.Mac during the Super Bowl and the home team is losing.

I'm no Taco Mac novice so when my friend wanted to go somewhere with good wings for Super Bowl viewing, I had a pretty good idea that T.Mac would be a contender. We showed up on Sunday around 4:45 and it was already packed (shocking). She put our names down and we ended up waiting for only about 15 minutes and scored the last table of the night! 

We got to enjoy the Super bowl on the upper level in a pretty deluxe booth for only the two of us. We immediately put our order in for beer, wings, and nachos. We went with the double order of wings (comes with 20 wings) and chose four different flavors: parmesan garlic, lemon pepper, honey chipotle, and honey BBQ. The wings also came with an order of fries. 

The only gripe I have about the food is that I wish it all came out hotter and not lukewarm but I get that they were so busy sending out food so it was only a minor issue for me. The fries were very tasty! hot, crispy and had a slightly herby flavor. The nachos were also good, although I could tell the scoop of guacamole was made from a mix and not fresh (again, not a big deal just an observation!)

I really have to give it up to the entire waitstaff that night. Knowing that it was going to be packed, I didn't really expect much in the service department but T.Mac delightfully proved me wrong. We had multiple team members check in on us, offering to take away plates, refill drinks, etc. They were all incredible!

It was a very fun night getting to cheer on the Panthers and I highly recommend stopping into a Taco Mac location during a big game."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sports bar/ restaurant you can go to if you really focus on watching to game. The way the tvs are set up you can see 6 tvs without moving your head. While that might seem like something a lazy person might say, it's important when you want to keep up with your fantasy football or of you want to watch baseball and football. The food is really good. I got a regular burger and it was pretty good. I also tasted the honey Chipotle wings and they where good. The service was good too. This isnt the type of place you go to sit down and eat a meal at. Because it's a sports bar it's loud sometimes but the perfect place to watch the game and have a burger or wings. I like this one better than some others because they don't rely on a few big tvs or projectors. They have the LCDs everywhere visible. Perfect set up and good food."}
{"text":"Very slow service and I have to order the same flatbread pizza every time to ensure it will be good to eat. If I vary from the pizza, bad news."}
{"text":"T Mac...meh. This place is nothing to call home about. It's a bar, it has bar food. The food is ok for the price. Some of the chicken is gristly but  sometimes that's the luck of the draw. They have a ton of beers but the beer menu isn't easy to read. The service is bad. Like BAD bad. Every single time! I have been to T Mac for dinners and the service was awful, I have been for happy hour and the service was awful, and I used to work down the street so I would go for lunch somewhat often and sit at the bar, and that was the only time the service was decent (hence the 3 stars). The dinner service is SO super slow. The restaurant would not be busy either. It's like they just forget about you, every single time. Southpark has a nice reputation but T Mac is not one to visit. The type of service it has should warrant cheap drinks and that is just not the case. I'll never be back if I can help it!"}
{"text":"I just left this place. I have left at least 2 scathing reviews from previous visits about just how bad the service is here.

Tonight was different. No joke, I just put the family dog down, I needed a pint and my expectations were low. A former ATL native, I just wanted something familiar.

Sean was new, but man this guy was trying. I might have had to repeat myself, but he wanted to be sure he had this order. He checked in plenty, but not that interrupting annoying way... more like WASSUP SEAN! The kitchen swapped our fries on our wing plates, but we didn't even care. We just picked em up and swapped em.

Tipped that guy 100%. Great server, good effort. 10 levels above these eye candy college girls who can't get it together when it's dead.

Sean might save this place. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this place. 

This is the worst place I have been in Charlotte. We waited 1.5 hours for our food, it was wrong when we got it, Lukewarm when it came out right, and the managers offer was the use of his 30% military discount.... equaling 3 dollars per person. 

The food is horrible and the managers apparently couldn't be bothered to make things right if the restaurant screws up. My favorite was the \"you seem like good customers...\" nonsense he gave us. Good customers? Every customer that walks in that door is there to pay you money for a quality product! Not have their day wasted by your incompetent kitchen staff and \"good ol' boy\" nonsense. 

Don't waste your money on this place. There are better bars to watch sports all over Charlotte. Pick one and save yourself the hassle."}
{"text":"We had a gift card to PF Chang's, so we headed out to Phillips Place at 6:15 on a Saturday. Big mistake. Hour and a half wait for a party of 2. We called Cheesecake Factory--same deal. We finally decided on American Roadhouse, a quick service burger place. Then my dad mentioned Taco Mac, so we walked over to Piedmont Town Center. We were immediately seated, and the place was loud and busy. 

Alabama vs TAMU was on, so naturally every time a big play happened half of the restaurant screamed. It was a pretty cool atmosphere. Our server introduced herself and quickly brought drinks with chips and salsa. My cup said Coke Freestyle on it, and naturally, my Sprite was disgusting. Oh well. I ordered a Hollywood Chicken Sandwich and my dad got wings. They both came out quickly, and after getting some honey mustard, mine wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it was decent sports bar food. Dad's wings were pretty good as well, but nothing we'd go out of our way for. The bill was $25, which was quite acceptable. 

Taco Mac is a great place to catch a game. Otherwise, there are many other restaurants in the area with a superior food offering."}
{"text":"I went to Taco Mac last night with my sister and we ordered 2 drinks ( hooch punch and electric lemonade). we had never had these drinks but tried them after they were suggested by our great waitress. Well after tasting the drinks, we did not like them but was told by the general manager, (short man) that it was their policy that customers had to keep their drinks even when they didn't like them. He stated \" we can tweak the drink to your liking but we don't like to take drinks back....We thought we were being punked and Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out.....Customers should be allowed to change orders if they do not like it....Has anyone ever heard of such foolishness....well Jason the regular manager saved the day....he changed our drinks and treated us with respect.....Customer satisfaction and professionalism  from Jason.....Jason get short man,general manager 's job....."}
{"text":"They have a great draft selection and good food. They also have great wait staff! Always happy to help and let you sample beers."}
{"text":"Ok, after our first disaster there, we tried again today. The sound went out of entire restaurant during World Cup. Manager didn't seem to worry or fix for 35 mins. My order came w guacamole all smoothed in it instead of sliced avocado and bf's chili came cold. Not giving it a 3rd try. BONG!! X"}
{"text":"Really love this place!  Wait staff is attentive, lively environment and family friendly!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a nearby hotel and decided to walk over to Taco Mac for an early dinner. We were seated right away and our waitress came right over. We had excellent attentive service for our whole visit. 

We ordered the guacamole appetizer which was fresh and tasty. The salsa had a good little kick to it. I ordered the buffalo chicken tenders and the broccoli queso casserole. If I ever want to test out a new restaurant to me, I will order something that I think can make or break a visit, buffalo tenders or a burger. Staples of traditional American bar food. If a restaurant can't cook either well, I'm not impressed. 

Their tenders were the real deal. All white meat, juicy and their hot sauce was the perfect amount of heat. I love some spicy food and they did those right. The casserole was amazing! Just like you'd want a broccoli queso casserole, cheesy and gooey. 

My daughter ordered their black bean burger and she devoured it, saying it was one of the best she's had. My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla and also agreed that it was equally tasty. 

For traditional bar food, they do it right. We were not disappointed and would enjoy another visit if we were in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Service was below average, we ordered wings and a side of tater tots, the wings were the smallest o have ever had and the size of the tater tot side was extremely skimpy. I don't recommend at all and have no idea how they stay open, considering my experience and all of the negative reviews I see."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have bad service. We sat in the bar area and several staff members kept checking on us. I agree that the beer menu is amazing! The prices are in line with what other beer pubs charge - between $4-$8 a pint. We had the chicken nachos. They were ok, nothing remarkable, and fairly priced. I think if you're looking to drink a variety of beers or watch a game, this would be a good place to go. So I'd go back a second time."}
{"text":"In Charlotte on business and hotel recommended TacoMac for a burger & beer. Got there on Sunday evening around 9:15 pm. No one seemed to be assigned to my table...one server took my drink order...another server took my food order and yet another server checked to see if anyone had taken my order. I never saw the first two servers again and the third server did appear to be attentive and after I had waited about 20 minutes he assured my my burger was on the way. 

My experience was the food was ok but the service was not very good. BTW: They were not busy at all when I was there."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest place I have visited in Charlotte when you come in ask for Rodney he is the best server in Charlotte and please don't forget to try The red roasted wings O my God they're wonderful. If ten stars was available that's what it would be ."}
{"text":"Seriously terrible

Pro:  Large beer selection

Cons:  Terrible food (seriously bad) mediocre service (at best)

We have gone to this location four times now and each time experienced either food so bad it was taken off our bill or service so bad we had to speak to a manager.  We have given this place ample attempts but every time it is just horrible....an absolute train wreck. 

If all you want is a place to watch a game and have a few beers, it's doable, but get food at your own risk."}
{"text":"Want to catch a game somewhere?  This place has 70+ TVs and an amazing beer selection!  They have like 140 beers on tap and another 200 or so by the bottle!  Almost overwhelming!  You definitely won't go thirsty unless you sit upstairs where we were.  There seemed to be a lot of empty glasses at our table throughout the evening.  When everyone starts complaining about it, you know it's a problem.  Next time I think we'll just hang in the bar area with direct access....."}
{"text":"Very bad service. When we walked in from the door, we were told there was a 10 min wait, even tough bunch of empty tables all around the place. Hostess said, kitchen gets slammed so they have to slow it down. After 10 minutes we sat down waited for another 15, nobody came to table. I guess we made a mistake with coming! We will do a favor with not coming again so kitchen won't be slammed! :)"}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin? First time patron.....walked in and greeted with a huge wall full of beer taps. Thought I died and went to heaven. Sat at open table in bar......well, 15 mins later someone finally stopped by to clean it and speak to us. By that time, already had grabbed a beer from bar. Ordered an appetizer, got it 15 mins later - good thing they comped it as I would've hated to pay the 9 bucks for what turned out to be a small plate of burned cheese dip. Decided to try the wings based on their recommendation - big mistake.  Simply, quite nasty, borderline undercooked, rubbery and tasteless. All in all, a complete waste of time going there. Outside of the amazing beer selection, this establishment offers nothing. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Taco Mac gets by because they have a gazillion televisions. If you want to catch a game or a bunch of them at once, Taco Mac is your place.
If you want to eat, I would suggest somewhere else. I will not say the food is horrible but it is very overpriced and just adequate. You will not be blown away by anything but for the price, you should be.
The do have the largest selection of draft beers I have ever seen. I usually have one maybe two beers in a sitting so I don't drink a lot. But I love a good craft beer and Taco Mac always has something new for me to try.

They do not take reservations so if you are with a group for a big game or on the weekend, plan to arrive really early or be prepared to wait a long time for a table."}
{"text":"The real loser here is all of that delicious craft beer that has to deal with dirty tap lines, bad food, slow service.

We went there on a Sunday at 6p...there may have been 20 other people there.   To get three draft beers served to us, it took 10 minutes.  DRAFT BEER!  

we ordered some boneless wings, and they came back extremely overcooked, they were like jerky.  We would've said something to our server, but he disappeared for 20 minutes.  We would've got another round of drinks, but we never saw our server.  I consider that mkney saved.

All in all there was reason why there was only 20 people there.   It's a shame, it could be so awesome.  I'll do the Flying Saucer from now on.

I gave it (2) stars just iut of respect for the beer that sits sadly in their beer cooler."}
{"text":"If you're going here for wings, just don't. Worst \"buffalo\" sauce I've ever had, by far. I ordered the mild boneless wings, which were pretty much frozen breaded chicken bites with a little sauce on top- totally dry and boring. 

The method in which they serve these is retarded. If you order mild wings, you get a wee little bit of sauce, but if you order hot wings, you get a LOT of the same sauce. It *should* be that if you order mild wings, you get the same amount of sauce as the hot wings, but a *different*, less spicy sauce. That's wings 101, man. 

So because their crappy boneless wings were dry as a bone, I wanted extra sauce, so I asked for more \"buffalo\" sauce and ranch. They charged us $.75 each for those sauces. Come on. 

Also, no beer specials? Really? Like... NONE. NEVER. They \"don't do beer specials\". Sorry, but if you're a beer and wings joint, to make a decision to never have beer specials is such an elitist attitude. People go out of their way to go out to eat during the week for specials and good food. Both of which, are not present at Taco Mac. 

The manager even walked by and asked us how our food was. We were very honest with him about our experience, and he got really defensive about the food and never offered to fix the situation. It was also deafeningly loud. 

The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 was because of 1) beer selection and 2) environment. They've got a massive list of beers, which is really nice (even though they're pretty pricey). They've also got mini taps all around the restaurant at select tables. So you can pour right into your own glass. Very smart. They've got big screens everywhere and it's quite clean. 

So if you want pricey, rare beer and want to watch sports, it's all yours. You won't find me there, though."}
{"text":"We had a group of 9 and were seated almost immediately they were not busy on a Monday night.   The service was prompt and our waitress was friendly.  I got the hickory burger and the flavor was good, it could have used a lil more bbq sauce.  The sweet potato fries were tasty as well."}
{"text":"Ordered Shrimp Mango tacos thru Grub Hub and they delivered lemon pepper wings and broccoli. After 30 minutes of back to back phone calls, someone finally decided to answer the phone. Idiotic response blaming Grub Hub- that they grabbed the wrong bag off the bar. I asked for the General Manager - Jason is the name I received. He was the most unprofessional GM I have ever interacted with. Continuing to blame the delivery service for the error and rudely stating he canceled my order and refunded the money back to Grub Hub. I didn't ask for a refund Captain Obvious- I asked for my tacos. Don't you worry- I will NEVER order from this establishment again. It is very unnerving that to-go orders are placed at the bar for any random person to come in and grab, go through and potentially tamper with food. Hopefully someone above this individual will get a clue before your business is driven into the ground. You see word of mouth is the best and worst form of advertisement. DON'T SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS THAT IS OKAY WITH DELIVERING HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, especially the beef on wick.  Hopefully it is getting back on the menu as us Western NY'ers don't have many options for this back home favorite. Beer selection is great and everything is reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Foiled again. We used to love coming here until about a 1.5 years ago.  Today we experienced a 20 minute wait when there were several tables open.  Our two appetizers came out about 15 minutes apart from each other. Food was mediocre. Service wasn't that friendly or fast. Today was a good reminder of why we stopped coming here.  Step it up management!"}
{"text":"I have been here countless times for lunch. Service is always amazing and I love their boneless chicken wings! Their ranch dressing is absolutely delicious and the sweet potato fries are wonderful. The draught beers are numerous and they have a great local brew selection. Definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"The food here is good and pretty consistent. The beer selection is other worldly and amazing. I had their new cracked pepper cayenne sauce on chicken tenders, which was delicious. The fresh guacamole is also very good. So why a 3-star review for good food, great beer selection, and a good atmosphere? The service is atrocious. I waited for 15 minutes at one point just to ask for another beer. I would have flagged down a server from an adjacent table, but they weren't getting service either. Doesn't matter how good your food and drinks are if it isn't delivered to customers in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Was a huge fan until tonight. Everyone seemed annoyed we even walked through the door. Service sucked...they brought the wrong drinks twice. We didn't get a chance to say anything because the only time the waiter stopped by was to take the menus...before we ever had a chance to order entrees. It was busy but not crazy, with plenty of seating. Biggest mistake was not going to Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll start off with saying I have had really good service except for tonight, however we were treated with excellent customer service by Art,  one of the managers.  We have always had amazing service (ask for Emily if you get a chance she is one of the best servers I have had by far!!... I'm also a server so I definitely appreciate excellent service) and food. My boyfriend and I have had nothing shy of excellent service from the bartenders as well. The food has always been excellent. Tonight are only problem was server error. We were ignored by our waitress (another kind waitress helped us more than she did). Our food was cold because she left it in the window too long, so finally another waitress brought the food to us. My boyfriend had asked for a beer and she took 20 minutes to tell us they were out (this happened twice). He eventually went to the bartender and got a beer and had closed out with her way before the waitress had even stopped by again.. she also messed up his order and forgot my chili. I didn't eat because my nachos because they were cold so she told me she got the manager to take them off and told my bf she was taking 50 cents off his bill for messing up his side item. When we received our checks she had handwritten the 50 cents off his check which we found fairly weird. We also found it strange the manager had not stopped by the table to make sure their customers were happy after that mess. We ended up asking the nice server (again who was not our server) to see if she could grab them...It turns out she didn't even tell the manager she was trying to hide her terrible service (hence why my boyfriends check was half handwritten) . I have honestly never had such terrible service in my life... which stinks since TacoMac is such a great place. I wish I could remember her name so I could save everyone else the trouble of going through that mess. I just cant believe It took 2 hours for 2 beers, nachos, chili and wings. HOWEVER LIKE I SAID TACO MAC IS AMAZING, the only fault is that waitress. We will definitely be back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Sort of non de script food served here. They had plenty of beers on tap from that perspective you could certainly find something. The food is about the same as chilis or TGI Fridays. I had the quesadilla almost inedible with some guacamole that had clearly seen its better days.   Go for the beer and skip the food."}
{"text":"Food and service were good.  Flatbreads were great especially the Buffalo Chicken and Hickory BBQ."}
{"text":"Buffalo Wild Wings is number 1 by volume of wings but Taco Mac have them beat. The Wings are big enough to have a meal out of them only. Over a 100 beers on tap. The Shrimp-avocado salad was excellent. The service was very attentive. Prices reasonable. What more can you ask."}
{"text":"Service - excellent.  Great place to watch the game - such an interesting dining room and bar.  I love the high walls - helps make the place seem more intimate.

The chicken nachos - BLAH.  Let me let you in on the secret to nachos.  Don't put a giant pile of nachos on a plate and then put the good stuff just on top.  You need to LAYER.  Otherwise everyone fights for the top couple of chips and the rest is just wasted.  HELLO.

The beer selection is fantastic.  Tho they did not have Hopslam - bummer.  Only the best places do.  They did have a Great Lakes beer on tap tho (just one!) But that is fun.  I have never seen so many beers on tap.  I can't wait to go back just for that reason.  If you are not sure about a beer then they will give you a little taste.  Very nice!  

Parking is easy right behind the building there is a parking garage.  There is a little patio out front which will be awesome in the summer.  Will be back - not my fav sports bar tho."}
{"text":"Well, looks like we're the outlier but we loved the food and service   The boys had fish tacos and wife the chicken tenders with parmesean and they said 5 stars baby."}
{"text":"\"300\" of us descended upon this glorified sports and beer bar.  Okay it was really only a 100 of us.  After spending the better part of an entire afternoon here, I must say that we were all accommodated and really could not complain given the massive amounts of people the waitstaff had to serve.  It seemed as if we were never wanting for a drink.  While not always accurate, drink service was quick enough.. even when we couldn't decide how many shots we needed.

As mentioned before, food isn't really the draw, but it was adequate.  

4 stars for being able to deal with all of us and keeping us consistently less than sober"}
{"text":"great beer selection but lousy food and service.  I've been many times and service is always slow at the bar.  beer is fairly expensive which is fine as long as the service is there.  The place is huge and can get very, very loud at times."}
{"text":"Smells awful.
Walked in and turned right back around
Friend used the restroom as I waited and she said it was disgusting.
Clearly the staff did not clean up from Friday night.
If CLT health inspection showed up they would easily get a C rating. I could smell the bar and how sour and rotten it was and yet no one flinched an eye
Disgusting. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Taco Mac serves quality food at a reasonable price. Try starting with the Queso Pollano. The Burrito Mac is huge. It comes complete with beef and refried beans and is topped with chili. The chili is very well done. Taco Mac's onion rings are thick cut. 

I enjoyed Taco Mac's outdoor seating. It overlooks a fountain at the South Park location. The portions are very generous. My wife and I packed most of our entrées to go. 

Taco Mac serves more than Mexican food. They are also known for Buffalo chicken wings and a large selection of micro-brewed beers. Sports fans will love Taco Mac. They have many large screen TVs with sports on inside. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love/hate--LOVE THE WINGS and BEERLIST, HATE THE SERVICE.

Taco Mac has a good thing going--with their extensive beer list, self service taps on the tables, and delicious wings.  But then there's the ugly side of Taco Mac... the ridiculous method that the servers have to follow, which gives the customer a terrible and frustrating experience. 

First off--you don't have a \"waiter.' You have a group of people that all do only 1 job: you have your friendly order taker; then there's the person that delivers your beers; then there's the person that delivers your food;  then there's the person that delivers condiments after you've waiting on your ranch or blue cheese and your wings are getting cold or by now your mouth is on fire...; then there is the person that takes your empty glasses off the table... you get where I'm going with this. They have to put everything through the computer. I've been to the CLT location 4 times and have had a horrible service experience EVERY TIME. The wait staff is friendly but the system just isn't working. You're either waiting on your beer, food, or condiments you ordered 10 minutes ago or suddenly you have 4 beers and 4 orders due to the service inefficiency and lack of proper communication.

Great place to watch the big game, just come with patience or make sure you sit at a self-service tap table or you WILL be waiting on your beer."}
{"text":"While a group of us were in town for a few short days, we decided to eat lunch here on a Friday. We arrived at noon to a pretty empty restaurant and were seated outside. After the waitress arrived and took our appetizer and drink order (4 Moscow Mules and 1 beer- not too complicated!), we waited over 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive- and only did they arrive after we spoke to a manager. We asked for a second appetizer that showed up after our meals arrived (they also brought out the same meal three times). The food was decent, but certainly did not make up for the absolutely awful service we experienced during a dead lunch hour. Once our checks arrived, we asked to speak to a manager to take our drinks off (which they should have done from the beginning). It is clear that providing customer service is not a pillar of importance for this restaurant and never again will I set foot in this establishment.

Update- I spoke with Kay, the GM, and she immediately remedied the situation. She was a pleasure to speak to, and i will definitely give Taco Mac another shot when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My review is for Taco Mac during the week. I haven't enjoyed my weekend visits because the place is so packed and so loud. During the week, it's still busy, but not insane like the weekend. 

Checked it out again for dinner this week, even though my past visits were deafening! We sat at the bar and the friendly bartender took care of us right away and brought us the massive beer list - I think there were 150 on draft! Oh my! We found out they give away Pint Glasses on Thurs night if you order certain beers, so I got the Sweetwater to get my free pint glass to take home! 

They have a big menu - sandwiches, burgers, wings and of course apps. We decided to split wings and they were really good! Hot sauce was just hot enough. My only gripe is they don't give you celery with wings, you have to order a side of celery for $0.65. I've never been anywhere that didn't include some celery with wings, I don't like that they nickle and dime like that. But, the wings were good so I'm over it.

We also decided to join their beer club - you get a card, get points, get free stuff. I'm already drinking beer, so I might as well get a free tshirt out of the deal! 

Check it out some time you're thirsty for a good selection of beers!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Took them over an hour for us to get our food, and it was cold. The waiter didn't fill up our drinks but once. Took him way to long to do everything, including taking our order. After we got our food we were so ready to go we just asked for togo boxes but they were out! They were out of multiple things, including some ingredients. When I ordered I was told they were out and my dish would be missing things? but they offered no discount or substitution. Do not go to this location. Bad service. Bad food. and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Food was good but server was absent.  Our visit started around 930 Saturday, restaurant had a few customers, but not busy. One of the other servers took our drink orders and we waited for a while before our server finally came by for our dinner order. 

I had the steak quesadilla lots of good flavor in there. My girl had the Philly cheese steak  which was also tasty but probably needed some toasting to keep it from getting mushy.   I also ordered the broccoli queso casserole which my server said was great but sadly never made it to the table with the rest of dinner when the another server dropped it off. 
I would have let our server know, but he didn't visit the table for more than 20 min, long after we were done eating.  More than a single beer? Not tonight.   Dessert? Too late for that now.  He did manage to drop the check (with the broccoli on it) but after a bit of wait the manager happened by and I asked him to take it off.  Manager was very courteous and brought back the corrected bill.  

Have had good experiences here but tonight was not one of them."}
{"text":"This is another nice spot. I loved the atmosphere. The mood was mellow. The food was A-1. 
The servers were on point the whole time we were there.
I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why anybody would not be a fan of TacoMac.  With 148 beers on tap and 105 bottle varieties, TacoMac is a treasure trove for craft beer fans.

I first learned about TacoMac right after I settled in Charlotte.  Unfortuantely, it took 5-months for me to finally try it out.  The thing is I had had ample opportunity to visit dozens of breweries so by the time I walked into TacoMac I knew what I wanted to drink: And, they had it.

Wow, cannot tell you how impressed I am with their selection. Moreover, they list out the style of beer, ABV, and prices for glasses and pitchers in a well laid out format.  5-Stars for beer selection. 

Even if you're not a craft beer fan you'd like this place. They have an awesome atmosphere, with TVs, and large bar area, ample seating, and even private keg areas for groups.  Never saw anything like that before. Call ahead for availability.

The staff is a gem here. Orean was our bartender and he was great. He explained everything beautifully, gave us samples, and also offered up ideas for us to do in the area.  Well done.  

I have not had a chance to try a lot of their food items, but they offer up a rich mix of tacos, soups, salads, burgers, wings, and flat breads.  I especially like their Side Items.  They have a Mexican Street Corn and House-Made Slaw that's to die for. We also got the Apple & Goat Cheese flat bread: I'm a fan.

I know a lot of the bad reviews I've read for this establishment were from casual Yelpers who complained about the service.  Let me tell you the service is not only great, it's 5-Stars.  

I'm giving TacoMac a 5 for atmosphere, 5 for Service, 3 for Location, and 4 for food. They get a 2 for the price of their sides: very disappointing  considering I like to order ala carte sides.  5 for beer choices, but a 3 for prices: more than I generally like to pay.

TacoMac is a solid 3-Stars in my book. Great catch all place for craft beer fans and a classy, yet oddly priced establishment for a range of food preferences."}
{"text":"Taco Mac brings you in for the great beer selection and the fact that a limited amount of tables have the ability to pour your own beer. Other than that, the food is very unpleasant. I stick to the beer and leave to a place next door for food."}
{"text":"We were just in taco mac and the waitress was so rude we actually stood up and left. We sat ourselves in the bar area, because usually at the bar you seat yourself. She walked up to our table and said \"for future reference, the host seats you.\" She then threw the menus on the table and walked away. 

I have never seen a waitress so blatantly act so rude, even if we did make a mistake in seating ourselves. She then continues to talk smack about us to surrounding tables. We stood up and left because this restaurant doesn't deserve the business. Go to Hickory Tavern or Fox and Hound--better food, better service, nicer people."}
{"text":"It was ok. We went there to watch a game and it took a while to get seated. They sat us at our own tv but then failed to put the game on for about 15 minutes which was annoying. The food was okay not the best nachos but a good beer selection for sure."}
{"text":"I love going to Taco Mac. They have hundreds of choices of beer. The food is good for being a bar :)  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Taco Mac a few times and have never had a problem. However, last night was definitely a waaaay different experience. 
Our server was as nice as could be and got all of the drinks correct. The kitchen, not so much.
The appetizer brought to our table was not what we ordered, but was taken care of in a timely manner. Then our wings and burger came out to the table. The wings were great but 3 bites into my burger and it was actually raw. As in, I feared that I was going to be violently ill just by the few bites that I did have.
Though they did bring out a fantastic donut desert because it was my birthday, I was very disappointed in the kitchen's execution. 
I really did appreciate the manager coming over and apologizing, but this is definitely a birthday I would love to relive... at a different restaurant :-/"}
{"text":"We went to Taco Mac in South Park last weekend for lunch. I'd been to one in Atlanta and had a really nice experience.  When walked in I noticed it seemed rather quiet. It was after 1:00 and thought we were in the late side for lunch. Anyway, I ordered fish & chips and my wife ordered grilled chicken tenders.  

Fish & Chips were lame; like you'd get at some CHEAP fast food restaurant.  Small portion and barely warm fries. 

Chicken Tenders were dry and not much flavor.  

Neither entree was more than warm. Why?  Well my guess is because our waiter / bartender left our food sitting in the kitchen.  I was wondering what had happened when shorty thereafter someone else served it. 

Doubt I'll return and the prices aren't any deal."}
{"text":"Personal History:  This was my 27th different Tacomac that I have been to. It was a milestone in itself. The first Tacomac I visited was about 15 years ago downtown Chattanooga on a blind date. Back then, I never heard of a Tacomac. But that's where she wanted to go. Since then I have made lots of friends at a Tacomac. I have had some good times at them and of course I have had some boring times while visiting different ones. A few have even closed that I went to. 

Beers:  Wow! It is the simple truth: Tacomac has the most beers on draft and in the bottle than any restaurant / bar that I know of. This Tacomac currently has 200 different beers in the bottle and 100 different beers on draft. Or is that pronounced drought? 

-------------------///////////////////----------------
Beer Club: Anyway, you can even join a beer club here called \"Brewniversity\" where they keep up with how many different beers you have tried. Once you reach 1000, you become a -Chancellor-. Personally, I know of a (double chancellor)which means that alcoholic, I mean that customer has had over 2000 different beers. I have no objective in racing to pass him nor become a so-called \"Double Chancellor\". 
-------------------///////////////////----------------

Menu items ordered:  3 all beef Tacomac Tacos. They were out of hard tacos so I had to order them as soft tacos. They we're pretty good and kept me from being hungry.

On Scene Customer Service:  Well, they were a little slow.  When I was ready to order, I had to wait several minutes. I could tell the bartender was avoiding me for some reason. He knew I was ready to order but kept talking to some girls at the bar who had a little too much to drink. So, I got the attention of the other bartender to place my order.

Final Thoughts:  Well, for some reason I did not enjoy my visit here. The food was good but no social inter action at all from bartender. I even tried to tell him that I have finally visited all Tacomacs including every one of them in and around Atlanta. Just no one cares, and  a \"da\" keep pouring beer response."}
{"text":"Great for viewing sporting events. Lots of televisions. The food, however, is another story. Worse hamburger I've had at a restaurant. Honestly."}
{"text":"I really try to take time and reflect before I post negative posts!  The company boasts existing over 20 years - REALLY?  In the banking epicenter OF CHARLOTTE NC - there are that many stupid people?  Why does a \"dichotomy\" sound so logical all of a sudden?  Ok - so the food was marginal - had wings and fries - Fries showed up stone cold - wings were ordered dry rub extra crispy - still bloody and too wet.  Now to the server and abusively lack of service!!  There is a chain called DICKS where wait staff knowingly abuses customers - did I make a wrong turn?  This server should not be working a busy sports bar on Sat ngt - or any night - or even be a server!!!   Honestly don't argue with customers!!  Don't get in a side conversation with the hostess when you have our drink refills in hand and empty glasses on the table - an on it went!  To recap - marginal food and poor service - add to that a myriad of places to eat within walking distance from this location - how do they survive is beyond me - but I assure you that it will not be with my support - nuff said."}
{"text":"People really seem to either love or hate this place.  I love it.  I love being able to catch a game literally anywhere in the joint.  I love the fact that I can join a \"Brewniversity\" (sp), where the more beers I drink I get rewarded.  Although that one might come back to bite me.  

The food is par for the course, bar food, but also a few selections that remind me of a typical chain like \"Outback\", etc.  Still decent.  

The service here seemed really good, very packed when we got there and even though the crowd died down a bit, the service kept up."}
{"text":"First timer on Sunday afternoon.  We met up with my boyfriends' parents and wanted to go somewhere we could enjoy the nice weather on a patio.  Bryan recommended Taco Mac, as he hadn't been in a good while.  We were seated right away at lunchtime on a Sunday.  Perfect weather and nice view of the fountains in Peidmont Town Center.  Our server was speedy and thorough.  Great local beer line up.  I ordered the Fiesta Nachos which were one of the most delicious nachos I've ever had!!!  Queso was spot-on!!!!  I devoured them and when I asked for extra salsa and sour cream, I was given a carafe of salsa and two nice scoops of sour cream!!!  (salsa was amazing, btw!!!)  Needless to say, this pregnant girl was in heaven!  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  I asked Bryan why we didn't come here before then and he said \"Well, I guess we'll be coming here more from now on!\"  DEFINITELY!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their food best in town... the service was so so but not bad.... will be going back"}
{"text":"It's Taco Mac, not a 5 star restaurant. The food is bar food, and it's ok at best. The atmosphere is chill. Lots of TVs. Service is ok. Particularly disappointed when I ordered dessert and was told that it's frozen and just popped in the microwave."}
{"text":"Taco Mac is a new casual / bar dining location. New to the northside, 2nd in Charlotte. Its definitely known for its wide variety of beers. However, since I don't really drink beer, I will speak on the food. There prices are good for the amount of food that you get. The Chicken Cesear Wrap is my favorite. 

The atmosphere is very inviting and comfortable. There's so much space in the new restaurant that you have your pick most times where you want to sit. 

Also, it's a good place to watch the game or local news because TVs are everywhere.  It does have some competition with the surrounding restaurants (TGIF, Chilis, Cheddars), but it's worth the stop in because of the food quality and prices. Plus if you don't want the usual wait at other places, this is a show in (especially for lunch)."}
{"text":"The food is unimpressive. The wait time for two menu items was an hour (during non peak, pre-dinner time).  I placed a to go order and when I got home I was missing several components of the items I ordered as well as napkins and utensils. I called to speak with a manager about my incomplete order and was treated with suspicion and distain by the staff on the phone, put on hold for a long time, and finally left a message for the manger which was never returned. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great selection beer to choose from.  I'm not talking good selection, but a beer menu that can be freaking overwhelming.  Extensive selection from local breweries which is cool.

Food is okay.  Lots of TVs if you want to watch a game.  Kind of a sports bar feel.

They must have gotten busted for serving alcohol to someone under 21 because they card EVERYONE, no matter if you are clearly over 21.  I went with my boss, who is her mid 50s, and they carded her.  If you come here and want to drink then make sure you got your ID."}
{"text":"Great food and HUGE beer selection!! The outdoor patio is nice during the evening- and the service has always been spot on!"}
{"text":"Taco Mac..what can I say..sigh.  One would expect some banging tacos from a place with this name.  unh uh people think again!  The food is not bad but it just leaves something to be desired, I have tried tacos and I have tried the wings.  They have an extensive list of beers for the beer lovers out there and LOTS of tvs everywhere you turn."}
{"text":"Service was fair. Food was fair. Lots of better places to go in the area. Food took excessively long, close to 30 minutes. That was during Saturday lunch 1pm and only about 5 tables in the entire restaurant were in use(now I know why). Great location and concept, just need to get their act together and manage the place better"}
{"text":"Meh. Wasn't expecting much and was still disappointed. I feel like a place called Taco Mac should at least serve up some decent taco options. 5 taco options that come only on soft flour torts warrants a name change. Anywho, as some may know...this place is way more of a sports bar than any sort of hub for Mexican or even Tex-Mex (I didn't). Perhaps that's why it's \"T.Mac\" on the building. Pros: they were open after the show we attended (got there at 12:30a), our server was very kind and attentive, andddd they serve food. Was this food the worst I've ever had? Maybe not, but my husbands chicken ranch wrap WAS the worst wrap he said he's ever had. He said he wasn't even sure there was actually ranch in it-dry and flavorless. I was hell-bent on some sort of Mexican but with no corn torts, not much adhered to my current dietary restrictions. I ended up getting chicken fajitas and just eating it sort of like a salad/bowl. The chicken was flavorless and kind of dry, onions and peppers are hard to mess up, the black beans were more like chili? My Abuela would have pitched a fit. I kind of pitched a fit (in my head, of course). The guac was amazing compared to the rest of our meal. I would not recommend this place or return."}
{"text":"Lots of different beers, lots of TVs, good food at a good price.

I'm from out of town and came here with some friends from here who love this place. We were looking for a place with a good craft beer selection that also had a good menu and we found it with good prices to boot. Nice sports bar :-)"}
{"text":"I have always loved TacoMac for their roasted wings but tonight something was very off. The \"roasted\" wings were clearly fried and tasted of oil.  The ranch and blue cheese cups for dipping had maybe a teaspoon each. We had to ask for more and even then that wouldn't have filled even one dipping cup. The hot buffalo sauce was definitely not hot and frankly tasted like BBQ sauce, which we did not order. Also, now the food comes in paper buckets. What is up with that? If I am paying a premium for wings, I would like a plate. I'm not at KFC. Overall, it was highly disappointing and I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Wild wings at 1.5x the cost. Beer selection is great but $6 for Gilcrist beer that goes for $12 a six pack? Really?

The wings are actually better than those at Wild Wings, and the BBQ habanero sauce is good when made spicy enough (no consistency between orders). 

However based on my buddy's experiences the rest of the food (boneless wings, burgers, nachos, etc) is pathetic. 

I'll be going to Mac's Speed Shop next time for good beer and food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Having never been to a Tacomac before (I am assuming they are a chain) I was expecting Mexican food. They have a few Mexican style dishes, but this place is definitely a Burger and Wings kind of place. Also they have a beer menu that has things I have never heard of before. Food was good and prices where alright, but two of my co-workers didn't get what they ordered. All and all Taco Mac is alright."}
{"text":"Below average service and food.  Don't waste your time at the Taco Mac in this location.  The Huntersville location is much better."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Taco Mac is actually what most people don't see. The Suite that the Taco Mac Brewniversity gets to use is so elegant. It's like a restaurant within a restaurant. The reason I knocked off a couple of stars was because you have to drink 13 different beers to get in and most people will never get to see it. When I go with friends, I can't take them to the suite with me and it's a bummer because the fried chickpeas and the different beer menu are so worth the visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Ordered wings, asked for all flats if possible. The waitress said we could do that. And asked for garlic parm on the side. The wings are brought to the table, no garlic parm, not all flats. Bummer. Ordered our main entrees. I see the waitress walk out with our food, then walk back in the kitchen.... Hmmmm? She comes over to the table a few minutes later to let us know the cook made the entree wrong. ... Such a disappointing experience at tmac. I used to go to the one in Cary nc and always had such a pleasant experience. Greeted, clean restrooms, great service. This one provided none of the listed qualities. The bathrooms were gross, menus too.  I know they have a person to clean them before lunch/dinner shifts... I'm not one to ever leave a complaint, just positive experiences.... Need to take some lessons from the Cary tmac."}
{"text":"We had a very nice waitress who steered me away from one of their advertised drinks by telling me nobody likes it and she isn't permitted to take it back if I didn't like it. They had none of the drinks my Companion requested but finally gave him \"something\" in the scotch family.

The food...I had their salmon and broccoli and it wasn't very good at all. As a matter of fact I shouldn't have eaten it because the pain in my stomach started about an hour after bed and I suffered until I was finally able to throw up at 4am this morning. Return visit? Never."}
{"text":"So, Taco Mac is not known for Taco Mac, or Mac and Cheese, or really, Tacos....so I have to wonder, were the founders two guys known as Taco and Mac? This joint is known for three things:
Beer
Wings
TV
They do all three well. I didn't even try to count the TVs, they are literally EVERYWHERE. This is a beer loving, sport fanatic's wet dream come true. They show a good mix of sports and vary the games b/t pro and college.

Definitely a kid friendly environment and the staff was great with them. The manager makes the rounds and everyone is busy but helpful (to guests and co-workers.) We were promptly seated on a busy Saturday at lunch, quickly greeted and received our drinks just as quickly. While the service and atmosphere are good, I feel they fell short w/some of the food.

The kids had corn dogs, sweet potato fries and apples. The sweet potato fries are some of the best I've ever had and the boys loved the s&p with the sweet honey mustard dressing. The apples were fresh and perfectly cored. Hubby had the wings and he said they were good, but nobody beats Hooters. I tasted and found them to be tender inside, crispy outside, medium heat was just right. BUT...but...the ranch. We both asked for it, him for wings, me a light ranch for my salad. It is house made and looks like tartar sauce. A bit gritty, super thick and with the weirdest flavor. We were later told it is garlic but nothing about that seemed garlic-y to me. I swapped for blue cheese (literally a first for me) and hubs liked the buffalo ranch. 

Now, the salad I mentioned. I ordered the Cobb that comes w/grilled chicken. It was actually blackened and not in a cajun-seasoning-lotsa-flavor way. It was charred and the flavor completely overpowered and ruined the rest of the salad. Also, the tomatoes were not quite ripe, they were a little past their best days. I usually devour salad and barely ate half. The manager made rounds and I know if I'd said something, he would've comped the salad, but I do not complain just b/c the way something is made does not suit my tastes (it'd be different if it were just wroooong.)

So, will we be back? Yes. The menu is extensive and a number of other items looked good - especially the onion rings at the next table. They smelled unreal and it was hard to stop myself from reaching over and stealing one. The wings were quite good and the service made up for the 'meh' salad and dressings."}
{"text":"My god people, stop it.  

You're writing reviews about Taco Mac.  TACO MAC.  Taco Mac, the Atlanta institution that has, thankfully, invaded Piedmont Row.  We should all pause and thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that we're blessed and Taco Mac is in our city.  

A couple of things to note to prep you for your experience:

It's a bar, not Applebee's.  Referring to Taco Mac as Applebee's is just disrespectful.  Applebee's could not pull off a beer selection like this.  Taco Mac has the largest draft beer selection in Charlotte.  Not only is it awesome, it's awe-inspiring.  And, it's a mile from my house - +1 for me.  

OK - It's a sports bar, not a bar.  If you want fine dining, go to Del Frisco's across the walkway.  It's a sports bar - they have unhealthy bar food.  And it's good.  They have 100,000 flat screens.  You can see any game you want.  This is your place to watch the Cricket Championship - they will have it not (Disclaimer - they probably will not have it on because we live in America. )

In closing - Taco Mac is awesome.  It's beer selection is unrivaled in Charlotte.  Stop hatin', start drinking."}
{"text":"Lots of tv's...they're everywhere.

The food is not that good and service is lacking. I also don't like their drink menu, I'm not a beer drinking kind of girl so I didn't see anything that I really liked."}
{"text":"T.MAC sucks, it took them over 40 min to get one taco plate order to us! Lunch was barren, which should have been the tell-tale sign to RUN!  Do not go here!!! They are going down - the Tuesday Taco is not a $6 special - it costs $9 for 3 tacos on reg. days, so they ACT like they are giving you deal --WAKE UP! They are only out for MONEY & provide bad service & HIGH cost and do NOT want to compromise if someone has a food allergy and needs replacement of an item! They want to charge you MORE MONEY for that!   This is a VERY GREEDY place.
So I guess the ONLY THING that someone MIGHT want to enjoy here is a BEER (but I don't drink)"}
{"text":"I love your Beer University, just going and sitting with friends even though beer is not a to go for me, its the atmosphere of Taco Mac and the great staff  (management included)

The wings are great if you hit them on a good day (some days there is not much meat on the bones, sorry to say its not consistent)"}
{"text":"Ordered a buffalo chicken salad through door dash. They didn't make my salad as requested . I got a salad with four chicken strips. Two cherry tomatoes cut in half and a very small amount of blue cheese on a bed of lettuce. And then forgot to include the salad dressing . 
This is why I typically don't eat at chain restaurants . Being over charged for crappy food ."}
{"text":"We returned after several months and we're really surprised how slow they were for a Saturday.  The menu has changed and they didn't have the Poblano Queso we used to order so that was a huge disappointment. Also my husband had to order at least 3 different beers because they had just \"ran out\"."}
{"text":"Love their buffalo chicken tacos with habanero BBQ sauce. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends who wanted to go to this place. This time we sat inside.  I had the Bacon Cheese Ranch burger and it was excellent. The burger was cooked as asked and had great flavor. The service this time was also excellent. The waitress checked on us several times. She brought the refill to the table without being asked."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch last week. We were looking for a quick bite to eat during our 1 hr lunch break and ended up deciding to come here.

The Good:
Huge Beer Selection (200+)
Lots of TV's (more TV's than what a Best Buy would have on display)
Lot's of seating (at the bar, booths, tall tables)

The Ok stuff:
The food. I understand it's a sports bar, but its just ok. It's not awful, its not amazing. I will try to go back and try there wings -- the waitress did say that it was the most popular item on the menu (again, a sports bar so I'm not surprised)

The bad:
The service was a bit slow. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, an hour and a half went by. We didn't order appetizers and she took down our drink and food order as soon as we sat down. I don't consider myself a very needy customer but after taking our order, we didn't see her again until she came back asking if we would like our check. There was numerous times where we could of used napkins, refills, etc.

Anyways, I would 100% come back here to watch a sporting event as the place did have an awesome set up for that. As far as coming here for a good \"dining experience\", I would have to pass.

I'm giving this place 4 stars because you need to review places based off what they actually are. Like my friend Paul says \"it's all relative\". This place is a sports bar, and that's exactly what you get. A GREAT bar, with OK food."}
{"text":"23 minutes to get a beer on a slow Monday night. Brought the wrong beer.  Not what I call good service."}
{"text":"Tons of beer choices, reasonable prices and lots of big screens. This is a great place to watch a game! My husband and I like to grab a beer here while we're on a wait at Terrace Cafe next door. Last time we even returned our buzzer and stayed here drinking and watching a football game. The food is pretty much what you'd expect at a bar but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch with my dad. He ordered a beer and when they asked for I. D. he looked at me and said \"I am F**King 83.\" Well the server got offended and my Dad said he was sorry and even gave her a $10.00 front end tip to prove how sorry he was. Well she went to the kitchen and started to cry and a manager came over and said to us \"I have a server crying in the back and she says you cussed her out.\" I explained to him that was not the case and told him the the comment was directed at me and not the server. Well from then on the sever was rude and unhelpful. If you are offended by what my dad said you are in the wrong business. I will never be back. If you go make sure you don't say anything that could possibly offend a server because at Taco Mac the server is always right."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience. Sat outside and service was beyond horrible. 2 drinks in a hour and a half. Decided to leave. I've had better experiences at the one in Atlanta (Dunwwoody). I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Not joking the worst and slowest service ever. There were literally 5 tables in the entire restaurant and it took 45 mins for the food to come out and everything as sub par."}
{"text":"They get 4 stars for having a ridiculous beverage choice, both beer and soda. 11.8% IPA on the menu, drink more than 3 and try walking a straight line. And have you ever heard of orange Sprite or purple Sunkist? Very cool. 

Food is not the strength here. We were also waited on pretty well, good waiters and bad waiters will be a flip of a coin in an environment like this."}
{"text":"The service is just to bad to bother anymore. The beer selection is great the food stinks for the most part. The service is horrendous!!!!!! We got here pre dinner rush and as usual starts fine then gets slower and slower. We had to wait 15 minutes for the check then when we got it, it wasn't ours. I'm sticking with world of beer."}
{"text":"Food was delish- had the grilled chicken and onion quesadilla.  We came to a large party of over 45 with one server and it was still fantastic service."}
{"text":"Never hated a restaurant this much!! The food sucks and the TV channels don't even show the games! They have terrible signal and nobody seems to care. Food wait went from 5 minutes to 15plus when our waiter advised us to leave! Terrible never coming back here. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Finally found a place for game night! Every booth got two screens! Yay! They even have screens outside!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is okay, I'd stick with the wings. The beer is awesome though!"}
{"text":"TM has decent food for a bar. The beer selection is great though which makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is a updated Review

Summer 2014 my fiancé and I came here for dinner. The service wasn't worth coming back: food was cold, and we were over charged on our bill. 

University Location:Yelp Party
I visited the University location for a Yelp Elite Event! Lucky Me I won a gift card for the most ugliest sweater yay!!! Thanks Nikki. The food was amazing along with the service.

South Park Location
Since I had a gift card I decided to give the South Park another Shot.
New Years weekend I took my mom to lunch around Noon on a Saturday...We were seated Immediately!The restaurant was clean, and our waitress \"Olivia\" was super nice and informative. 

We had 2 Orders of Wings, a burger, and steak quesadillas....majority took home for the guys lol. I am HIGHLY impressed with TMac. We definitely enjoyed our meals! The food was PERFECTION! Nice Presentation, flavorful and Hot!

My experience was Much better this time! Keep up the good work. I'll be coming back again soon"}
{"text":"We have been to this T-Mac 4 or 5 times but I haven't visited in several months. We recently (11/21) stopped in for lunch and something has drastically changed since our last visit.  After being seated, it was 6-8 minutes before we were acknowledged. Our server 'Owen' took our drink order and a minute or two later another person (manager?) dropped off free Queso to our table for the wait, which was great because we ordered it anyways.  15-20 minutes following that we finally received our drinks (no apologies for the delay, mind you).  20 minutes later we had not yet received our food (wings and tacos, nothing extravagant).  I asked our server if we could get our check because we were running short on time and he just replied 'ok'...no apologies, no question as to why. He dropped off our check and left.  So we paid (including our 'free' Queso) and left.  Something has changed at this location and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great service, decent food, freezing cold restaurant. This is the 2nd time I've been here and both times I attempted to use napkins as a blanket. Lots of TVs so a great spot to eat and watch sports. Attentive staff so you don't have to flag anyone down for a refill. 1st time I went I got the shrimp, mango, and guacamole wrap which was good and healthy but not too filling. Last night we split an order of 20 roasted wings with tots. The sauces we got were three mile island, honey chipotle, and hot buffalo. None of them were spicy and they all sort of tasted the same."}
{"text":"They apparently fired previous management & that's not a bad thing. Watched the Panthers beat the Falcons...place was packed & the service wasn't t bad....quite surprising considering I've been there at slow times & the service was terrible. Keep trying Taco Mac...maybe add SPECIALS!"}
{"text":"Well I joined some friends here for lunch yesterday, even though I wasnt excited about it considering the reviews I had read.  Well.....the beer selection is overwhelming and the TVs are great.   I went with a salad cause how can you damage a salad.  Well, it was the most tasteless salad I think I've ever had.  I'm not sure if the waiter knew what he was doing or if he ever knew where he was.   Great place to watch a game, but eat somewhere else before you go."}
{"text":"Came here on a fairly busy night and it took the server over 20 minutes just to even greet my fiancé and I. About 10 minutes after we were sat a server came by and said he'll be with us in a second and never came back. Yes I do understand how busy restaurants get (I work in one also) but to have customers wait for 20+ minutes without drinks is unacceptable. I'm a nice person so I didn't feel like getting a manager involved. Although, I would very much prefer the hostess put us on a wait rather than be sat and wait awhile before we get drinks. We ended up getting greeted by a different server than our original server so we just go ahead and order the food. It was alright nothing special and mind you I gave this place 2 tries in hopes of better service so I definitely will not be coming back. Servers please let the hostess know if you're too overwhelmed and you can't take anymore tables instead of having customers wait forever they will understand!!"}
{"text":"Brewniversity?  Where do I enroll?  Actually I already did, but it's a pretty cool program to tack onto this place.

The Southpark location is a bit different than the UNCC location probably due to the fact that the UNCC location took over a steakhouse while Southpark took over something else (I can't remember for the life of me what was here before TacoMac).  Anyways... parking can be a pain.  If the area is busy, and for the most part it is busy all the time, the deck can be a nightmare trying to find parking without 1) ramming into a concrete wall and 2) ramming into someone that is trying not to ram into a concrete wall.

Once you survive parking, there's a pretty big waiting area in the front of this TacoMac.  For good reason too.  The first time visiting, we had to wait about 45min (standing)... but the beer and wings were worth it [I keep telling myself].

There's a nice outdoor patio area - but I have not had the pleasure of enjoying a meal out there yet.  It's actually quite funny that the two times I have gone here, the hostess seated us at the exact same booth both times.... I can understand that happening occasionally, but this place is quite big with lots of tables.

There looks to be an upstairs at this location... don't know if it is reserved for private parties or if it's just another overflow area, but I will investigate some more!

Overall - this place gets a solid 4... the waiters do a good job and seem pretty knowledgeable about the beers on tap (or usually find someone that does know the answers)."}
{"text":"Came in for a bite and a brew or two on a Saturday afternoon.  

As Melissa B says, this is a great place to watch a game. Every seat has a great view of at least 4 TVs so you are bound to find a game that interests you.

This place is also HUGE!  There's a big 1st floor dining area but I was seated upstairs and there's two large seating areas there.  To go along with the size of the place the beer menu is huge.  There had to be over 400 selections with like 150 on tap.  

The place claims beer and wings as their specialties.   So I tried both.  Well I attempted to try both.  Two of the beers I wanted to try they were out of.    For the wings, I asked if \"Hot\" was really \"Hot\" and my server said no which is what I find across many wing places.  So I opted for the next step up, the Three Mile Island flavor. 

The wings were big and were juicy, the flavor of the sauce was ok but it still lacked the heat I was looking for and the more wings I had, the more I disliked this flavor.  Some of the wings I've had were even rubbery.   

I thought the prices were a bit high here.  $30 for a few wings and 2 beers?  No thanks.  I don't think this place is worth returning to.  Too many flaws for $30."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this by saying I have been here at least five times in four years, and there is always poor service.  I went here because it was my sister's birthday.   I was hoping that this most recent visit would prove that the Taco Mac in the university area had changed.  NOPE! The service was terrible, at no fault to the wait staff they are spread too thin.

We had arrived and waited 5 to 10 minutes until our friendly server should see us.  Ordered waters and a few beers.  Our waters were brought to us but waited about 15 to 20 minutes on the beers.  We ordered our food and chatted.  My father had finished his beer and ordered another as our food was served 15 to 20 minutes later.  After he had finished his meal he was still waiting on his beer.  He told the waiter to not worry about the beer it was to late now, and the waiter said he understood and he was sorry about that.  Eventually the manager came over with the beer and gave it on the house.  My father explained to him that there was poor service due to no fault of our waiter.

I honestly hope Taco Mac management see this, and potential customers.  I walked in to five hostesses waiting to seat people.  Two waiters that's also bussed tables. One bartender. And one manager, that when he was told there was poor services explained to us that millenials were lazy and it was hard to find good workers.

This location  is surrounded by office parks, they serve a large variety of good beer and have okay food.  But they are always empty.  It's beacaue of poor service not due to servers fault but due to servers being understaffed.  I joked that our server cooked our meal and that's why it all took so long, but now I'm wondering if that's the case."}
{"text":"Been here countless times to catch a game, grab a beer and have some bar food. I love the endless selection of beers and the \"brew niversity\" gimmick that encourages you to try different beers for fun incentives like t-shirts, mugs, etc. The atmosphere is really cool. Big open space, lots of tvs with every major sporting event represented. Waitstaff is hit or miss. I've had some amazing servers/bartenders and some pretty bad ones too. Just depends on the night I guess. 

a lot of people seem to dislike the food, but I think it's alright. I like the chicken nachos and the wings and the cheesesteak is pretty good too. But I'm rating it as bar food and not on the same scale as a fancy restaurant. To me, the draw here is the beer. Not every bar has the goal of having an endless selection of beer, and it does its job. And for bar food I think that it's up to par with a lot of the burger, wings, fried food places that I've tried. 

It's definitely one of the better places to watch a game."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football games on Sundays, but if you're coming before the 1pm games, I suggest you lock up your tables about an hour before the game. Trying to creep in around 12:45pm will not cut it. You WILL wait until at least halftime or so. Overall, this is an alright joint. Obviously, they're known for the tons of draft beers. The food is above average. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and their Sweet Potato Fries are a few of my favorites. The only downfall about the place is their service is below average. They should have their most experienced associates working on really busy days. You can tell that the large crowds overwhelm the newer waiters/waitresses. They tend to screw up orders and don't come around as often as they should at times. The other thing that kinda irritates me is they have to get management for customers that have South Carolina IDs/Driver Licenses. I completely understand needing management for out of state IDs, but SC? Come on.....with the Charlotte area being right on the state line, seeing SC IDs should be as normal as seeing NC IDs. Anyways, it's an ok place. I know what to expect when I go, so I just go with my game face on."}
{"text":"Sunday at 1:30.  Parking lot half empty.  Building half empty.  They tell me its a 1/2 hour wait.  Huh ?.  Staff more people.  It's Sunday lunch...."}
{"text":"Wow. This was bad.

We went to Taco Mac because we love beer and a friend wanted us to meet up with her in the South Park area (we normally don't frequent)

This was a random week night. It was PACKED with guys (listen men- this is NOT the place to go to find a chick...because there are very few women). It was LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD. It felt like a frat party. We sat upstairs in an attempt to get away from the noise level.

1. The service was atroucious. Examples why:

a. The waitress knew NOTHING ABOUT BEER. If you are going to claim to be a great beer spot in Charlotte- then please hire some ppl who know about beer. The Flying Saucer has hot chicks in short skirts who know about beer. This is totally possible. WE asked for suggestions and she looked baffled. I asked for a Ranger and she said (and I quote) \"I have never heard of that\". WTF.

b. the bathroom did not have toilet paper in it. Gross. I told the server. She didn't really respond. I told another server. They all placed blame instead of correcting the obvious problem.

c. the food came out cold. We complained. They eventually heated it up. They never apologized. They never docked money off the check. We are talking COLD WINGS.

d. we must have had not the brightest waitress- but she seriously kept messing up our beer orders.

2. The food sucked and the menu is weak. 

Hopefully- I will never go back."}
{"text":"TMAC has a terrific atmosphere.  It is very well managed and the food is consistently prepared. The servers are friendly and the enviornment is great for the game day. I would highly recommended this restaurant, especially if you're into no hassle fun."}
{"text":"Come here to drink beer.  You can get food and it is just fine but I can't say I am ever hankering for any of the menu.

The bartenders are always very personable.  On the downside I saw some PDA between a bartender and some waitstaff, not keeping your eyes on the customers is a big no no for me.  It was also unprofessional.  A mere five feet from the door to the kitchen would have been discreet."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming our go-to restaurant to watch the game (whatever game that may be).  Love the ambiance and family friendly feel of the place. We've always been able to walk right in and get a good seat in front of many Tv's. The food is pretty good too.  I've had a burger with sweet potato fries and one of their shrimp wraps. Both were above average in my opinion for sports bar food. 

The wait staff has always been really friendly and attentive as well. I was a little bummed though when I visited a few months back that they wouldn't show the UFC fight because they are a family oriented sports bar. I get it but was really hoping to see the fight since I knew one of the guys fighting. All in all taco mac is well worth a check in or two."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Pretty chill.  Good place to catch a game or \"get out the house\" spot.

Service: Jive alright.  From the hostess to the server they didn't seem to mind working Thanksgiving Eve.

Food: I usually stick to the wings and the chili at T-Mac.  This time around Lemon Pepper Wings and Medium Buffalo (with extra sauce), along with French Fries were the items of choice.  The Lemon Pepper, always on point, consistent at each location.  The sauce for the Medium Buffalo is not my favorite, but somebody likes it.  To compliment the wings and fries, the \"house\" ranch was...ranchy.

Drinks/Beverages: Water and Goose Island IPA.  I'm a fan of IPAs and for commercial IPAs this a decent one.  It was also the beer of the month (Yes, I'm in the Brewuniversity).

Overall: On the list of places to watch the game, have a beer, and grab some wings.  Not at the top of the list, but definitely on the list."}
{"text":"They have a lot of beer choices, a lot of tables & a lot of TVs.  You can see multiple tv's from every seat in the place & on the outside patio.  

They have specials each night, so look those up.  I know Tuesday is Taco Tuesday offering 2 tacos for $6.  I like the shrimp & fish tacos.  I've also always enjoyed their queso dip served with tortillas & chips.  Great place to watch a sport of any kind."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for a drink the other night.  There was no seating in the bar area so we had to sit at a table upstairs.  It was the first time I had been there and I have to say the place is really big.  

Our waiter explained that it was \"pint night\" or something to that effect and if we ordered a Purple Haze we would get to keep the glass that it came in.  He then mentioned that they were out of Purple Haze glasses so we would not be getting a glass....ok?!?!?!  He then went on to tell us that they had a mug club and something about getting our names on a plaque outside the door if we drank a gazillion beers and asked if we would like to sign up.  We politely declined and said we would sign up next time!

I don't know how many beers this place has on tap but I know there has to be at least 120 taps on the wall, probably more.  I also don't know how many TVs are in there but they are everywhere.  From where I was sitting I think I counted about 45 of them but I know there are more than that.  

I'll give this place 3 stars for now because I haven't tried the food and I didn't get my Purple Haze glass... :-) Grrrr!!!!"}
{"text":"you gotta try the new baked wings with the hot sauce....AMAZING and 80 cal less per wing!

What more can be said, tons of TVs, lots of beer and decent grub with a Cigar lounge next door."}
{"text":"Great selection of quality beers, especially IPA's! Food was fantastic! And most importantly, great service!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I will not be returning. Worst service aka management I've ever witnessed. Took over an hour to get our food & the \"management\" gave us a discount of 10% off our bill. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Decent wings service wasn't all so great, would come again to see what else they have to offer"}
{"text":"I have kept trying this place for 3 years, I believe its time to write a review.  The negative is the food is not even mediocre, its bad.  The positives its a great sports bar you can watch multiple events on many TVs from you table.  They have tables where you can pour your own beer out of tappers.  The service is good.  Go there to drink and watch sports but don't venture out to eat the food."}
{"text":"So, I had some service issues in the past, but today everything was great.  The beer selection is outstanding.  Had a chance to get Founders CBS on tap, and if you know beers, you know that's not an easily accessible commodity.  Food is decent.  Wings were on the small side, but they were crisp, and very tasty, and I like the proportion of sauce to size.  Not a fan of fat wings anyway.  Anyway, great place to watch a football game and chill."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, ok place to drink a beer, kind of crappy place for chicken wings."}
{"text":"Let me state this for the record: You can NOT claim to have Buffalo wings if you do not use Frank's Red Hot in your sauce. No exceptions- period. 

Also- if you order pizza and/or wings in Buffalo you will receive not only Celery (a given) but Carrots as well. 

I wanted so badly to have real Buffalo sauce on my wings but Taco Mac did not deliver. The Hot sauce was mild to medium ( I am wimpy when it comes to sauce too so keep that in mind) I definitely needed more heat. I also was asked whether I wanted fries OR celery? Since when did wings come with french fries? Does anyone really not want celery with their wings- that's craziness! 

I did enjoy the ranch dressing- kind of unique and had chives in it- a little gourmet touch. Also, the prices were pretty reasonable $6.99 for a half pound of boneless wings. 

The place itself is a bit overwhelming unless you're a television addict. I felt like every inch of wall space was covered by a tv - who needed ...you know...conversation. I wasn't a huge fan, I suppose if you want to watch every single game going on in the 50 states at the same time, this is your place. The place lacked personality-where are the pictures of old-time downtown Buffalo??- Or at least a Miller Jersey.....

The beer selection looked awesome- Ive never seen personal beer taps at your table (cool!). The service was excellent. Our server was so friendly -and very accommodating. 

I probably would have given 2.5 stars but I was so disappointed by their false claim! Just because you have Beef on kimmelweck  and name your menu items after Elmwood Ave and Kenmore doesn't mean you know how to deliver Buffalo food to the South. 

Cue end of rant."}
{"text":"A nice place to hang out with friends and watch a game. The servers are friendly and food is pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying this place.  They responded to my previous yelp review where I said I was not happy with there food and service.  They say they have improved everything.   I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"So I admittedly was rather unimpressed with this T-Mac. Considering the location in a high-end area and surrounding competition I kinda expected better. The menu is your typical T-Mac stuff. Lots of bar-food including wings of course. There are several taco choices and since it's in the name you'd expect them to be pretty good. I wouldn't tout them though. For the same price I'd rather do Cabo Fish Taco or Krazy Fish here in Charlotte.

They have a crap-load of beer options but beware of the attempts by the big beer companies to win your patronage through their far less worthy \"crafty\" options. The bar here is also, likewise, huge. It spans the length of one entire side of the restaurant. Prices are what you'd expect from similar restaurants like Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili's, etc.

My last visit here was on a weekday night when there was no game going on. Naturally they were dead. Similarly, the staff was pretty useless for lack of a better word. Slow to check on us or come back after a wait to take our order. And slow on refills. Considering the price I don't plan to come back to pay what I could pay at a local restaurant for better quality and service. But all in all, I wouldn't call it a horrible experience. Just what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Ready for 81 Samsung TVs worth of pure-T overwhelming? Boom! There you have it. This place went up quick and got popular quick. Probably a much needed alternative to places like the Hickory Tavern up the street. Taco Mac seems to be the go to joint for game nights. But if you're looking for a good meal and conversation you had best check the game schedule or you won't even hear each other speak over the hollering and cheering.

I ordered the buffalo chicken tacos and was surprised at how good they were. That aside, I have no idea why the hell they named the place Taco Mac. It perplexes and confuses me to this day. Seems like you could give a place a more interesting name if you were just going for something random. Yeah they have tacos, but obviously it's not why anybody goes here. If you're looking for an energy filled drinking night with the local gang and a good game watching experience this is where you belong."}
{"text":"MEH is right.  was told it would be an hour and a half at least the other night, took that in stride and went straight to the bar where it was so packed you could barely breath, way too many dudes up in that joint.  sat in the only 2 seats on the entire bar, in front of a computer game and only bc my friend is supremely aggressive when she wants to sit down and very good @ acquiring said opportunities.  so we crammed ourselves in the corner and tried to enjoy ourselves.  they have an over the top beer selection and i love beer but im mean really theres only so much good beer on earth.  we had a really nice bartender and server, the chick checking people in was pretty much rude.  the food was nothing special, i had fish tacos, she had a portabello wrap, the fries are great but i can make much better food than that.  overall very unimpressed as a whole with taco mac.  oh yeah, someone puked in one of the urinals = awesome.  i'll certainly go back once they get another month under their belt to see if it is the jam like i heard it was but i doubt it could get that much better.  for a crazy beer selection and bar food i'll take duckworths any day over taco mac but again, i'll give taco mac another try, it is an impressive space with tubes everywhere."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this building, it was a steakhouse, and anyone that has been reading for a while knows how I feel about casual steakhouses in general, and perhaps even Texas Land and Cattle specifically.  Put another way: Taco Mac really had a fairly easy comparison to live up to here.  They really didn't make it.

Starting off, about all they did on the inside was add a bunch of televisions.  And when I say a bunch, I mean a bunch.  There must be fifty of them.  It is good to have somewhere to go to watch the game, but there are so many, you cannot avoid them if you want to - and to make matters worse, they added glass at the tops of booths (to help with sound from the next table?), so the sets reflect and it looks like there are not fifty, but a hundred sets.  It is really distracting.  But enough about the sets.

We went for lunch, specifically because they had a Coke Freestyle machine.  My wife loves them.  But Taco Mac has a full-service variety.  Any of you whipper-snappers may not realize that full-service means that someone gets it for you.  Sorta defeats the fun in the Freestyle - you have a hundred or so flavors to play with, but you have to figure out which you want and order it.  Go to Firehouse instead, where you can check out the touch screen wizardry for yourself.

The good news is that there are plenty of servers (presumably so that they can keep those glasses full), and they are friendly enough - but they do not listen well.  We said we didn't want to know about the all-too-impressive beer list, and were promptly told all about it.  We asked for advice, and were given some suggestions - all I can say is that if the suggestions were good, I would hate to have gone with something not suggested.

As has been mentioned elsewhere, lunch service is slow.  Don't go here if you're in a hurry.  Even getting the check and paying it can take a while.  Plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice without any complaints. First time I got chicken fingers in hot sauce. Their ranch is probably one of the best I've had. It's really thick with possibly green onions in it. We also got salsa and queso. Second time we went, me and my fiancé each got wings. To our surprise it was buy one get one free because it was chicken wing day lol. Wings are ok. They are small. I tried the macaroni as my side item and it was just ok."}
{"text":"Large parking lot. We were immediately greeted by the hostess. Food was delicious! Wings were banging and the chicken and bacon ranch wraps were good!"}
{"text":"If your a huge sportsfan and beer drinking this place is for you.  I like the fact they have my favorite beer on draft and bottle a little pricey however 4.75 draft for Woodchuck and bottle was 6.75.  TV's everywhere over 140 draft beers great to the draft beer drinker.  However the food was not good.  I ordereded the wings I like mild when I asked if they were spicey the server said they use the same sauce for all wings they just add more for if med, hot, hot  hot.  Okay strange but I ordered them they were small and hardly any meat on them. The sauce was okay not mild a little kick to my taste buds.  Great place to hang out and drink if your wallet can afford it but the food left me wanting to go to wendys for buffalo bites lol"}
{"text":"Skip this place if you want to eat. I ordered boneless buffalo wings and they're definitely frozen. Barely sauced and a couple of my friend's weren't fully cooked inside. They were good about it and didn't charges us for hers. They come with fries or celery. You get charged extra if you get both. Celery is cheap, c'mon folks. Don't be stingy. They have a whole wall of taps so if that's your scene have a beer and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Great food waiter apologize for being new. Ok I get that but apparently he never waited tables before either. No one there only 5 patrons and took 20 minutes just to get our Margaritas. Service was horrible. If you can't get good service with 5 customer's I would hate to go there when their full....."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. A server did not come to our table for thirty minutes and only then it was because I had to request one. Drinks were delivered thirty minutes later. Dinner finally showed up after another hour. Lack of customer service and training. We visited two years ago and it was great, not sure what changed."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place.  First, I'll start with the good.  It's in a great location and has tons of tvs.  Beer selection is great.  A lot from North Carolina and local beers which is always a big plus.  As far as a sports bar goes, it is decent.

Less than stellar is the service and food.  When you walk in from the decor, you expect the food to be a little better than that of a Wild Wings, or somewhere similar.  I feel like they are going for a more upscale sports bar, but they miss the mark.  It's just a bit confusing.  If this was a hole in the wall dive bar, I would not at all be criticizing the food (Because hey you get what you get).  When we first sat down the server who greeted us was not the server who took our drinks, which was not the server who brought our drinks.  When our actual server arrived he appeared a bit disheveled like he didn't expect to be sat.  He was friendly enough, but seemed aggravated we were just there to drink a beer and not eat.  If you're looking for a good beer and solid television selection you may enjoy this place.  If you're looking for any sort of decent meal for the price, maybe try something else."}
{"text":"so i love love love the tv's in this place. i go here often to watch the my Lakers play! the food is ok and its not expensive. if you are a beer fanatic this is the place for you. i believe they have about hundred different beer; possibly more. the staff always gives me weird looks, and i don't know why that's the only downfall. lol."}
{"text":"They went down hill. Quac looks like left over from last night. Chips greasy clumped heap or just broken pieces. Been dining here for years. Guess Taco Mac's transition to T-Mac mean bad food."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because it's been about a year and I decided to give this place a second try...bad idea. I went on a Thursday, they do free glasses if you order certain beers. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same beer and didn't get a glass, when we asked our waitress told us they were out, but we saw couples that got seated after us get their glasses. Not a huge deal but annoying. It took our waitress about 20 minutes to realize we needed another round of beers, then brought us the wrong ones. I ordered the black bean burger and as soon as I took a bite it fell apart I couldn't even pick it up with a fork. I asked to speak to a manager but he was on a conference call at 11 at night.......I doubt that. Another waitress came over and told me it fell apart be they don't use rice anymore bc they don't carry it on their menu...but they have a new rice dish on their menu. I order black bean burgers at almost every place I go to and this is the only one that falls apart. My boyfriend ordered a flat bread and t tasted like it came out of a freezer and had been microwaved. Their prices are too expensive for their awful quality of food. I definitely won't be going back. It's in a great location, I hope it goes out of business and they put something much better in its place."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. Been to this place 2 times. First time I went and ordered wings. When they finally came out they were disgusting. The waitress saw me grimace and said \"oh yea they make that sauce from a powder, it's really gross right? I probably should have told you when you ordered it\". I couldn't believe it. Very angry I had to pay for it. The next time I visited it was an NFL Sunday. Our waiter took about 45 min after we sat to come get our drink order. We told him that we would order food at half time. He didn't come back to our table until the game had 10 min left (roughly 2 hours later). Finally by the time we got our food the game had been over for 20 min. Our waiter apologized when he brought the check and said \"sorry it's busy\".... no crap it's busy, your a sports bar and it's a Sunday. I couldn't believe the horrible service. We asked to talk to a manager and after he didn't come to talk to us for over 30 min we just left. It has a ton of TVs, that's about the only positive to this place, otherwise it pretty much sucks."}
{"text":"Great Beer selection! The tap tables are awesome! Food isn't the best... but honestly, I don't go there to eat."}
{"text":"Great Beer selection! The tap tables are awesome! Food isn't the best... but honestly, I don't go there to eat."}
{"text":"Would give ZERO stars if available. Seriously 820pm on a Saturday at a sorts bar and two couples waiting and they tell us it's a 45 minute wait for a table because the kitchen is behind. It's bar food people . Hire more staff and let us watch the game with a beer and the more than 20 tables we saw open"}
{"text":"Waitress was awesome, Beer was good, and food was average. Didn't really make sense to why they wouldn't show a free UFC fight because they were a family restaurant however they are willing to show other violent sports."}
{"text":"Very cool bar. No Flying Saucer, but awesome none-the-less.

Definitely the place to be when there is a game - TVs everywhere. Plenty of tables (many \"tables\" are island bars with their own taps). Food is pretty tasty (Wings, fried or roasted, medium, +10....they staff will know you're a pro) and prices are fair.

Staff is very friendly and fast - I went for a work-day lunch but you can tell these guys and gals can handle the crowds. 

A little out of the way (not easily visible from Harris and not visible at all from Tryon), but a great place for beer and snacks."}
{"text":"Best selection of beers and knowledgeable bartenders. Get the Three Mile Island wings. Best food on the menu. You must also have an order of chips and queso to go with your brew. It compliments any palate."}
{"text":"I live right next to this place and find it to be a convenient place to grab a drink and watch sports.  This place yoyos in my opinion though hence only 3 stars. Ive had great service and ive also had very poor and slow service.  They have a decent beer selection but the food department is lacking in my opinion. I ordered wings (twice) both times they were cold and overly dressed with sauce.  The queso con carne is about the best thing on the menu in my opinion.  But as usual ill be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Love the atmosphere and unbelievable selection of Craft Beers"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and thought the food was pretty good. Good atmosphere for watching sports. I thought the tap tables were pretty cool. Never been able to pour my own beer while sitting at my table."}
{"text":"I love walking in to 11 empty 4-tops to be told there is a 30 minute wait. Must be hard to keep people working here.
The good news, the Buffalo Hummus has reappeared since the last time we were here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, atmosphere was like an average sports bar.  They have every type of beer you could possibly want.  TVs everywhere.

Wait staff left a lot to be desired.  Appetizer arrived after our meal, server only came to the table once, no refills, manager came by but didn't apologize when we mentioned the bad service.

I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, new place, new staff... will give them another try in a couple of months.

If you go, plan on a wait, plan on it being noisy, and plan on bad service!"}
{"text":"OK -- someone needs to say it.  A nice place to watch the game, a fantastic selection of beers, very friendly staff, but quite possibly, the worst food in Charlotte.  Even for bar food.  It is a menu of mostly junk using what appear to be the cheapest available ingredients.  I know it's about the beer, guys, but I've eaten the food a few times here (including last night) since they've opened a couple of years ago, and I've always been astounded how bad it is.  At least at other places, the junk food tastes good.  This doesn't.  Come on, guys, it wouldn't take much to change this."}
{"text":"Be prepared for poor service. Server didn't know the menu or the beer selections. It took 4 requests just for water"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at this location. We wanted to sit outside because it was a beautiful 70 degree evening but since they were short staffed again we weren't able to. We were sat down at a booth and met our waiter. He told us he was new so we didn't expect exceptional service. My friend and I ordered the mozzarella sticks appetizer and the buffalo tender meal. The tenders meal came out with no sauce and the appetizer came out 15 min before we left. Our waiter brought the manager over to our table but she didn't seem to care that we were unhappy . Another waiter came over that recognized us from his previous job, he brought my friend her ranch and took some fries off my plate. I didn't even know him like that for him to think that was appropriate. After that we was fed up and asked for the check so we could leave. This is the 2nd disappointing experience at TacoMac, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I come to Taco Mac often.. And I ALWAYS  order the chicken fajita and a 1800 margarita. On this visit I was very disappointed that the fajitas was taken off the menu and I didn't have 1800 tequila. I was already there so I was forced to order something different off the menu. Will probably find another regular bar to go to."}
{"text":"I go here ocassionally when others suggest or for business meetings. 
Parking is close by and easy. 
This place is just dirty. The floors, the glass, the bathrooms. Ladies room is trashed even shortly after they open. There is a chipped first step on staircase that has been broken for at least 2 years.
The food I have had is mediocre.Any piece of meat I have ordered reminds me of my ex mother in law's cooking.Done to dry death. 
I wouldn't go unless you had to."}
{"text":"Don't try going here during your lunch break, because you will be late getting back. Also, even ordering the most basic meal does not guarantee your order will come out correctly."}
{"text":"I had dinner at T Mac for the first time tonight. I thought the food was pretty good. A friend had suggested that I try the wings, but I really wanted something that came with a side item. I went with the Philly Cheese steak. I asked the server which side item was the best, and she recommended the broccoli casserole. She was right- it was very good. The cheese steak was good too. Not great, but not bad. I was still kind of hungry, and almost ordered some onion rings, but I just had dessert instead. I ordered the S'mores brownie. I didn't care for it at all. I found it to be cloyingly sweet, and I think it was warmed up in the microwave. I even let my friend finish it, which is really saying something because I have a quite a sweet tooth. I was with a large group, and the service was quick and efficient for the most part. There was some confusion, but I think that is to be expected with a large group. I will return because I think the menu has a lot of promise. I wasn't blown away by T Mac, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came out here with a colleague of mine for a few beers after work. They have quite the selection of beers which I did appreciate, although a bit overwhelming.  Also, I liked the infinite number of tvs that they had.  Enjoyed the flautas that we ordered as well.  Only thing is that the brews are overpriced considering its beer.  Probably wouldn't come here for drinks, I'd rather probably just grab a few drinks from Georges Brasserie next door and have dinner there.

Troy, a server, was awesome.  I left my keys there and he came out to return my keys.  Pretty cool considering I was meandering about Piedmont Town Center for a few minutes."}
{"text":"I am giving Taco Mac 4 stars because it is better than any of the other restaurants around it.  

We got the nachos and wings.  The nachos were piled high as nachos should be.  The wings were good too.  I think they are better than the two wing places in the area (buffalo wild wings or wild wing cafe).  However, the habanero BBQ were not that hot for being second hottest wing.  Also, hot, medium, and mild just mean how much sauce they put on the wings so I recommend getting hot.  

Taco Mac has a wonderful beer selection that is a little pricy. 

More TV's than anywhere."}
{"text":"Great service.  Excellent television coverage.  Not so good food.  Not even the fries."}
{"text":"Went to Taco Mac on Saturday for the first time with my girlfriend, and had a truly outstanding experience.  Our server Emily was an absolute delight and incredibly knowledgeable.  Food was really good and the atmosphere was wonderful."}
{"text":"I normally visit Taco Mac at least once a month. had a call in order and one of the orders was incorrect. I tried explaining to the cashier that it was incorrect. She rudely cut me off twice. Since I was on my lunch break, I had to leave. I called back and asked for the manger. As I was explaining to him the situation, he asked \"Nobody is going hungry because the order is wrong are they?\" Excuse me? At that point there was no use in continuing the conversation. The manager said \"Next time you are in here\". There will be no next time. To make matters worst, once I got back to the office another order was incorrect and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Our group of 19 had dinner here tonight. Service was excellent. But the food was just regular run-of-the-mill sports bar fare."}
{"text":"Awesome beers. Awesome atmosphere. Always nice staff. After a couple beers and DEATH wings you can walk to other spots for dessert etc.  Piedmont Row has a GREAT alive after five in the Summer."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with tons of beer varieties to  sample. The atmosphere theme is beer, sports, and tons of TV screens. 

Not sure why people don't like the food-maybe they should give it another shot. The soft pretzel served with a beer cheese dip was great. My table had chili with all the fixin's, shrimp mango tacos, street tacos, and the chicken sandwich. 

They have calorie counts next to each entree which may not be a beer drinkers care but, I sure liked it. Casual dress, free parking garage next door. Average prices."}
{"text":"My choices were limited as I just arrived in town Sunday night for an all day meeting Monday.  After checking into my hotel, I hit up ol' faithful to help me find a bite to eat nearby.  The last thing I wanted to do was have to drive anymore after dealing with post holiday traffic entering Charlotte.  I ended up opting for Taco Mac because it was a stone throw away and I could grab a beer and catch up on fantasy football stats while I waited for my take-out order.  I sat down at the bar and waited as the bartender went about his business.  It was obvious he wasn't much of a people person as it took him about five minutes to acknowledge me by setting down the menu in front of me while he finished a conversation over the Bob Cat's game with a passing server by yelling through me.

I ordered a beer and opted for a Chicken Caesar salad and a six pack of boneless habanero bbq wings (reasonably healthier than what  my guilt free conscience would order).  The order took about 20 minutes, but I was occupied with the big screens behind the bar.  After my food arrived, I closed my tab and headed back to the hotel with the food and was back in no more than five minutes.  When I opened the containers, I was surprised by how poorly my order was executed.  I ordered wings with celery and ranch, but what I received was french fries and blue cheese. Okay, no big deal.  Looking at my wings, it looked like they gave me way more than what I ordered so that made up for the error...but after biting into the wings, the breading was so thick, it practically overwhelmed the chicken.  They were also very sparing with the sauce on the wings, so it made for a very dry crunchy bread bite.  Since I received fries I figured I might as well enjoy 'em.  After a few, my taste buds were locked on a flavor of Salt & Pepper UTZ chips (a personal favorite).  

Moving on, I decided to check out my Chicken Caesar salad.  I popped the container open and on first inspection everything looked fine, but I thought they forgot to include a container of dressing to accompany it.  Wrong!  They pre-dressed the salad and by the time I opened it, everything from lettuce to croutons were beyond savings from absolute sogginess.  The chicken was spared though as they grilled it above and beyond, resulting in charred-dry chicken strips.  

Overall, not impressed.  Food can be easily fixed, but the service will require bigger strides to improve customer satisfaction by doing things right and respecting the customer. My realistic rating is 1 & 1/2 stars culminating from service experienced, mistakes on my order  and food execution flaws."}
{"text":"I really missed taco mac had not been for at least 3 years. I don't even know why but I tell you what glad I came to see the NBA Finals our waitress was awesome she thought about things to accommodate our experience not just to get a tip. The only draw back is they need to find a better way to regulate temperature because some tables are directly under vents and it gets so cold you can't even think warm."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a bar-food kind of gal, and when I heard we were getting a Taco Mac in Birkdale, I was disappointed. You see, I lived in Atlanta and had been to Taco Mac several years ago, but was never impressed with the place. But, times have changed and this Taco Mac is better than I've had in the past. 

I think the food is marginally better than Hickory Tavern. Whatever you get, you have to try one of the queso dips as an appetizer, with chips AND tortillas. The tortillas come warm, folded over, and are just divine with the spicy queso. 

The pork quesadillas are pretty good as well. And, for only $7.95, I consider them a bargain.  To be honest, though, my chicken fajita quesadillas were a tad bland on a different visit.  And the fish tacos were also bland.

When crowded, the inside is so loud you can barely hear yourself speak. There are a few tables inside that have taps on the tables, but they are never available.  Because we don't like a lot of noise, we usually eat outside, and we really like the spacious patio, with plenty of TVs and heaters for when it gets cold. 

Service is hit or miss, though, regardless of whether you sit inside or outside.  I am so tired of getting asked for my ID when I order club soda.  That's NOT an alcoholic beverage!

Taco Mac is a good place to try if you like wings and basic tex-mex food and, of course, a great selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot at all. I've been plenty of times and will keep going back. I dig the atmosphere. Spacious, bright, and with plenty of TVs, like any sports bar. You have your pick of the litter when it comes to beer. Taps are always changing but with well over 100 selections, you're sure to find a tasty brew. I usually just pop over here for a drink and on a nice night, the patio is the place to be. 

The food isn't anything to brag on. Tasty but not memorable by any means and something you could snag at any chain restaurant really. Occasionally I'll grab an appetizer here but that's about the extent. 

The service is truly hit or miss at TMacs. I've had good, on point service - usually by sitting at the bar - and I've had several, not just one, but quite a few servers at TMac that just seem confused or end up rarely coming back to the table, dragging out our visit. Last time I stopped in, our server was really nice... whenever she actually came over to the table... but messed up my food then told me they didn't have a beer I ordered. I then pointed to the tap handle and informed her, yes... yes you do and then my beer was served. Granted, she apologized but after being left for 15 minutes (no exaggeration) with dry glasses, all 3 of us at the table wasn't too pleased. She then brought my beer but never returned with my friend's beer. Like I said, this is pretty common in my experiences at TMac I hate to say. 

Yet, prime location in South Park, awesome beer menu, and if you are looking for a game, they definitely have it - but if it's a big game, be sure you head over early to grab a seat or you'll be left without one."}
{"text":"My other half and I went here last night after work, so we arrived late- about 10:45 PM on a Tuesday. We found a sparsely populated bar and booth area, which was no surprise given the time of day and week. Still a good number of servers on the floor, and the house manager, Cooper, was on deck as well. Full menu was available until 2 AM, which is great for those of us who work 2nd shift.
Service was good, very friendly, very accomodating (other half was not definite about his beer selection, and needed help/samples/prodding). Downside: no one seemed to know the beers all that well. Upside: too damned many beers to actually know in 6 weeks of being open! 
The beer menu looked a lot like the Flying Saucer Flypaper, which is a good format. There are no flights, a/k/a themed sampler trays offered; having them could be an improvement. If you're going to go head-to-head with the Saucer, you need to promote your variety. Just sayin'.
Food was as varied as the beer. We opted for the nachos-huge!- and a dessert- chocolate chimi-yummy!!! Note to self: Nachos are really big for two people as an appetizer, but just right as an entree to split. Ditto the dessert.
Back to staff. Our server was extremely nice. Ask for Noelle. Tell her I sent you, and that I still don't know where I recognize her from! *g*."}
{"text":"Taco Que is awesome! Marty was the best server we've ever had here! Kudos!"}
{"text":"They got televisions like a Best Buy on Black Friday. They got beer, the got great bartenders (Kim Rules!) and they got televisions, but there is nothing else to it.

Did I mention they have televisions? Yep, lots of them, lots of bland bar food on the menu too! The service is good, the beer selection is good, the beer specials are less than special, the food is even less special than that."}
{"text":"I love their wings! I like the fact that you can choose between fried or roasted. It's a good place to watch a game. They have lots if TVs."}
{"text":"Ehhh...just ok.  I say that, because I don't like the food.  Which, it IS a beer place, in all fairness, so I shouldn't judge based on that...but you have GOT to have good food with beer in my opinion.

The service is not bad.  The bartenders keep up with the flow pretty well.  The beer selection is vast and there is pretty much something for everyone. 

I just wish they would change up the menu.  Small plates? More crafty foods? More thought and feel into the food vs bar food...blah blah."}
{"text":"Literally nothing special. Many draught beers, but would NEVER go back to eat. The food is worse than bar food and just gross. Greasy, flavorless and disgusting. I was very disappointed!! Prices are too high especially for that crap."}
{"text":"This restaurant is moving in the right direction. The customer service has greatly improved. With the right management in place they are starting to work out all the issues. I am excited to give them another try and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Well, back a few years later.... Same review 
Wings are great, beer is cold and cool taps at table. Service is still WEAK. Bartender could not care less. Maybe a smile once and awhile? Goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I guess I just had really high expectations when I went here because I by the time I left I was disappointed. I went with a few friends after hearing how awesome this place was and although it did have some cool things like taps on the tables and a pretty kick ass beer selection, the food and service was not that great. Our experience started with being seated at a table that had drips raining down from the AC system. The waitress was very pleasant until we pointed out the constant dripping all over the table and asked to be moved - then she became very unpleasant. She said that it was only water and it was no big deal if it landed on us or in the food. We felt differently as we did not want water from who knows where in our food or on us. We were moved out of that waitresses section to a drier area. That said, after we moved to a different table, she came back and said she would still be our waitress. The service was not very good from then on and I feel it may have been because of our disagreement with what was acceptable and what was not. The food was OK... nothing to write home about. I would suggest going here for beer and appetizers only.  Maybe if I check it out again it will be a bit better.  I know I am jaded because of the service we got."}
{"text":"Taco Mac has good food for a sports bar and consistently good service. I visited Saturday and was waited on by Trevor, who was nice, knowledgeable, and gave his true opinion about different dishes, as I was debating between a burger and tacos. I went with his recommendation and got the tacos, fajita steak; fajita chicken, and mango shrimp. Each was good, but I think the steak and shrimp were better than the chicken because I expected the chicken to have more of a char grilled taste.

My friend had the Garlic Parmesan wings, which were delicious. Make sure you ask for them to be charred so they have more flavor. 

This is a pretty well oiled machine and they do a great job handling high traffic."}
{"text":"Chicken was undercooked, with blood still leaking. Management would not acknowledge our poor service, and Macaroni was disgusting. Never coming back! 

Update: Management fixed our meal, replacement was wonderful. Kay, the general manager was great! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for a drink and a bite to eat. Service was good,and steady not fast but not slow. We opted to sit outside and enjoy the weather. Wouldm definitly go again for a first date or if I were in the area but not drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Slow Service. Mediocre Food. I ordered a pick up order today at 2:51pm. I drove straight to the restaurant and proceeded to wait at the bar for 20 minutes for my food. I left the restaurant at 03:35pm. It shouldn't take 44 minutes to make a hamburger and fries. The bartender was nice but slow. She spent 10 minutes playing with a draft beer spout while i waited for her to take my payment. Fries were old, and luke warm with some burnt ends. If i wasn't already late getting back to work from my lunch break, I would have given it back. Go to the South Park location."}
{"text":"Boneless Wings had a tasty sauce, but not enough sauce and too much coating for my taste."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here! Came here last night for dinner and waited 50 minutes for our food. I told the manager and he insisted it couldn't have been that long of a wait? Like what?? Why do I have to lie about my wait time lol. We ordered chicken wings and tacos both with fries. This place wasn't even slightly packed for us to have to wait this long. When the food came out no apology or anything. Is there any good customer service anymore? I will not return sad to say because they have the best TVs for sporting events."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for a quick yummy meal. I've been here several times and usually get the nachos, they're delicious! The bartenders are friendly, the atmosphere is inviting and definitely geared towards a sports crowd. Their customer rewards program gives you points for every beer you drink to keep you coming back! Only gave four stars because I did sit at the bar for quite a while before being helped during my last visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a Shrimp Caesar Salad. I could count the number of shrimps that was on it than the croutons. It came with so many croutons, I started placing them on the side of the bowl. I guess I'll have to order a \"CROUTON\" Caesar Salad the next time I go, maybe I'll get a ton a shrimp on it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for beers and lunch. Lots and lots of beers on tap. My last visit, this past Friday, however, was not a good experience. The food and beer was fine. I had the grilled shrimp tacos, a little small but overall good flavor. It was the service that was lacking. We started at the bar and once everyone arrived we moved to a bartop table. Well, that really through them for a loop. After almost 15 minutes we finally got someone to stop and take our order. One of the guys I was with tried to order beer 3 different times. They were out of all 3 beers he ordered. I know that's not the staffs fault but it just seemed we were destined to get bad service that day. Will I be back? Probably, but just more wary."}
{"text":"I think this place is a solid 4 stars.  I've been here twice so far and both times the food is pretty good.  The one area they lack in is the service. The staff is very friendly, just very slow. Both times I was here the restaurant wasn't very busy and it took awhile to get out food. I do like it here though and will return"}
{"text":"About 5 years ago, I would have given TM 5 stars as a corporate wing spot.   They took pride in their wings.  The wings were a good size. They had sauce on them.  And their Three Mile flavor, their hottest sauce at the time was a solid flavorful medium.  

Today, they serve pigeon wings that are dry and lifeless at room temperature.  Sauce is no where to be found on the wing. They continue to charge premium prices for their servings.  And their much hyped Slo Burn sauce with scorpion peppers is not at all what they claim.  Not even a bit of sweat at the base of my neck.  Which for me is a good sign of heat. 


TM.  You are off the list."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep expecting this place to get better but it doesn't. Order an app, which showed up after only one of our two entrees appeared 15 minutes after the first entree. Servers are friendly, but this place has a long way to go."}
{"text":"Great Place.  Excellent staff. Made this place our hangout while in Charlotte for March Madness.  Good food at fair prices.  Lots of beer choices, a tad high priced, but a lot less expensive than other cities we have traveled for the Tournament.  Tell the staff the \"Uncle Dan's\" crew from Cleveland will be back."}
{"text":"Beer fans unite! The food is pretty tasty but not mindblowing. Love the upscale sports bar feel and all the beer choices. Has something for everyone! The roasted Apple and goat cheese salad was spot on but would have been better with toasted pecans or walnuts. The chicken on it was spot on though! Would definitely get it again but hope they add nuts or cranberries to it for a little more heft."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with 2 stars. We walked in to no one at the hostess stand and waited about 5 minutes before someone noticed and seated us. We then waited another 5-10 minutes before asking for a waitress. We had 3 different ones in the next 5 minutes asking is someone had taken our order. We ordered beers and waited another 5 minutes and one of them was delivered incorrectly. Our order was 6 boneless wings with fries, an iceberg wedge salad and a bowl of tortilla soup. We waited approximately 30 more minutes before the wings/fries were delivered. The waitress said that she asked for my salad to be redone because the lettuce did not look good (and it would be one minute). My soup was not brought out at that time. 20 minutes later after my tablemate had finished his food my soup and salad arrived - neither of which take a significant amount of preparation. It would've been fine but was told they were out of bowls so I got two cups of soup. Unfortunately one was lukewarm and the other was cold. We finally asked a passing waitress (not ours) to speak to the manager.

If any one of those things had happened, then I probably would've been fine. But all of those things happened and what we hoped was going to be a 30 minute meal turned into an hour and a half nightmare killing the rest of our night and errands. And the restaurant wasn't busy - the bar had some business but there were only about 5-6 tables with food patrons. One of the early waitresses said they were short staffed and we over heard them asking another waitress to bus tables. The only reason why this is getting 2 stars is because the manager did comp my food.

Needless to say it will be a long time before considering to come back if at all. It was my first time there and it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Oh dear, we had a terrible time here service-wise.  When we sat down and the waiter finally came by, told him our son was VERY thirsty.  He took 10 minutes to come back and take drink order.  At which point I walked my son to the bar to get him some water.  The waiter took another 10 minutes to bring drink order.  Husband ordered steak WITHOUT blue cheese and sure, enough, it came with blue cheese.  The rest of us finished our dinner and his food still had not come.  I wanted to love this place - was a major original Taco Mac fan during my college days from 1979-1982 and was looking forward to introducing my family to my 'old hangout'.  Love the humongous beer selection.

On a positive note, the Death wings were definitely HOT.  I have a hot-food eater in my family and we try wings everywhere and they are never hot enough - saw tears in his eyes for the first time.

Manager comp'd our meal after he heard about our bad service AND gave us a gift card.  I guess I will come back with my son and leave my husband at home.  He will never return."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited a Taco Mac, or TMac as they are trying to trend. First visit was the South Park one. Waiter had 3 tables yet disappears for 30 minutes at a time. They even brought out our order of nachos that looked like it was sitting out for an hour. Oh did I mention my drink was empty for a good 20 minutes with no waiter in site? 

Last nights visit was to the university area. The service was slow but everything was going good until the bill came. Everyone watch your bills, I had a beer that was $2.75 more than the menu price and another that was .50 cents higher. A friend was ripped off $1.25, and a couple other at my table had drink prices charged to their card that was different then their super beer menu indicated. I honestly wonder how much extra money this place has made on people who just swipe and sign?"}
{"text":"I love Taco Macs.  When it popped up under nearby bars in Untappd I knew where I was going for dinner...should have checked the Yelp reviews because not all Taco Macs are created equal.  

For a Monday night with football on, they weren't that busy, probably not even 35% capacity.  I sat at the end of the bar as several people had tipped up chairs to save for their friends, a big faux pas for me as bar seating should be first come first served, yet half the seats available seemed to be reserved.  

Anyway, I set down and waited 15 minutes before anyone even talked to me.  I had looked up most of the beers under the categories \"stout\" and \"ipa\" in untappd.  It went downhill from here.

To my neighbors surprise, who had ordered wings 10 minutes before me, my hamburger came out first.  In fact, our bartender said he completely forgot about his wings.  I had received my beer and water, but no silverware or napkins.  Asking for some when he set down my plate along with ketchup.  10 minutes later he returned with ketchup and I once again asked for napkins...it's hard to eat a dripping burger with a beard without napkins.  Once again he returned with ketchup and I asked yet again.  Then when I was almost done with my burger he asked if I needed anything and I said, \"I need some freakin napkins, I had to borrow one from my neighbor!\"  

So service completely sucks.  

As far as the beers go..yeah, they have a big selection but quantity does not mean quality.  There weren't any nitro beers aside from Left Hand (the bud light of nitro) and the barrel aged beers weren't highlighted.  On top of that, I completely missed a large group of beers on the front of the menu under the local section..I incorrectly assumed that they would all be on the giant beer list on the back.  

Long story short...the Taco Macs I visit in Peachtree City is one of the best beer bars I've ever visited.  This one...horrible all the way around.  Bad service, bad food, bad selection, they even let the smokers stand with the door open to stay warm letting smoke blow into the restaurant.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hey Mac, I do not understand the crowd here... at least after my experience.  I guess it could be the numerous beers to select from or maybe the numerous flat panel TVs.  To me, it was just \"meh\".

Atmosphere - Chain restaurant on steroids, been there done that-ish,  large, more TVs than Best Buy, tiered, noisy, crowded, they do have tacos...not sure about mac & cheese. 

Food - I should have gone with the same dish (Los Cabos Fish Tacos) as my friend as he thought the tacos were decent.  Me, I had the Buffalo & Blue Cheese Chicken Sandwich w/ a side of fries.  You think this would be a safe dish for any place.  Unfortunately, the bun tasted of a generic grocery store variety, the chicken was present, and the sauce...the sauce tasted like spicy spaghetti sauce on chicken...it was awful.  To top it off, the fries were over seasoned to the point that I could only eat a few.  Normally, I eat any fry provided.  Due to the seasoning, I left more than half on the plate.

Service - The girl who waited on us was nice but very busy.  The manager did stop over and ask how the meal was, but it was more of a going through the motions than really asking as I clearly gave a \"meh\" and a bad face with the inquiry.  All I got in return was an \"all right,\" then he walked way.  Maybe my reaction was received as positive...I do not know. 

Overall - With a big \"meh\", I doubt I will be going back anytime soon...mac."}
{"text":"So I really have conflicting feelings about Taco Mac.  The food is solid, the beer selection abundant, and the TV's are set up to the perfect angle for your viewing pleasure from any spot in the house.  

That being said, the beers are way overpriced, and service is OK at best.  We had to chase our waiter down to order anything.  I have been twice now and it was the same both times.  

Now I don't mind over paying for beer, but to me high dollar product should come with high dollar service.  I would to back here, mainly because it is a good place for larger groups."}
{"text":"So I will say, our waitress was extremely nice and friendly... Which is always a plus. But when it comes to the actually service part, so very slow. Took almost 30 minutes, no exaggerations, for our chicken tenders to come out. I work in a restauraunt, therefore i am usually pretty leniant, but when tables that ordered after us recieve their food, i get a little ticked off. Asked for a side of ranch, took about 5 min to recieve it... Im sorry but unless you have to ring it and wait for a food runner to bring it out, it takes 30 seconds to go grab it and bring it. It was supposed to come with the food, but it was forgotten. 
The few other tables were irritated by the slow service as well, i could tell. One man had his card ready to be ran for 10 minutes and he had to ask the host to get the waitress!
Food was really good though, sat outside and it was nice. Never were left with empty drinks.
Overall, I have tried this place a numerous amount of times and each time I go back i think the service will get better, but it doesnt! 
I believe i will go back in a few months and if the service still stucks, sorry taco mac, no more service from us. 
WHICH YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT!!!"}
{"text":"If you like cold, greasy, food after waiting for 30 minutes, this is your place. Not sure if the waitstaff is overworked or unconcerned but then it's hard to find out through the forest of tv screens. Oh well."}
{"text":"Pile on alert. I read all the service warnings and low & behold they had a point. I was meeting up with a friend and this place was halfway. Didn't heed the warnings, and sure enough no one greeted me when I came in so I just sat myself and then had to ask for a server when no one came. Once I finally got service everything was fine. This a cool place with good food, so I'll give it another run. Hopefully, a better experience awaits..."}
{"text":"There is a God and he created Taco Mac for mankind!

Food:  Buffalo Chx wrap with onions. 4/5. French fries. 5/5. Buffalo wrap isn't on the menu but they offered to make it for according to my specs. I will try the wings next time for sure.

BEER:  As far as the eye can see. Every kind, color, nation, and price. I am on the clock so I didn't order one but it may have taken me damn near an hour to decide. Also, there beer club is free to join and has pretty sweet benefits. Offers pitchers as well. 

Location:  6/5. That's right. You read that correctly. 6/5. TVs and sportscenter on everywhere. Free WIFI.  Supremely clean and modern. Taps at the table!! Two floors. Located in a very safe and classy section of Southpark.

You will love it. Enjoy!

{"text":"I was having lunch with a friend in the University City area, who suggested Taco Mac.  First thing I noticed were the HD TVs - they are everywhere!  No matter where you are seated you have a good view of several sets.  This must be a sports junkie's paradise!

I ordered the Smoked Turkey & Swiss Panini that includes warm smoked turkey and melted Swiss cheese on a crispy ciabatta roll with spicy mustard.  It was also listed as all natural and made with made all-natural,
phosphate free and 100% vegetarian fed deli meats.

They really piled on the turkey in the sandwich.  With as much meat as it had, it could have used a bit more mustard to enhance the flavor.

Server was efficient and pleasant.  She attended to our table while also giving my friend and I the opportunity to enjoy our conversation.

Much better restaurant choice than the nearby Bikinis sports bar."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was good. From start to end, every interaction we had was very poor customer service. We asked the hostess for a table or booth anywhere that could accommodate a high hair. She brought us to a high booth and told us it wouldn't work for a high chair, and asked if we wanted a booster. We have a tiny 1 year old so we told her anything else would work, and had to reiterate. The whole building was empty, and every seat type was available so that was odd. Then our server Ali came 15 minutes after we were seated for drinks. We decided to order everything at once, not knowing when we'd see her again. Our drinks took another 10 minutes. The food we had was great but our kids meal was never ordered, so after we got our meals our kids had to wait for theirs to be made. Our drinks were empty most of the meal and we had to go hunting for silverware. Overall, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Good food good service.  I have been here 2 times before and was disappointed in the food both times. I got the BBQ chicken salad with the fat free balsamic vinaigrette this time and was very pleased. I always liked the fact I can get flavored Diet Coke.  Our table all seamed to enjoy their food as well. Enjoyed being able to see the Panthers game as well.  The manager changed some of the tvs to the Panthers for us. Very accommodating.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food quality has totally declined at the South Park location. Very disappointing. I got chicken and steak fajitas--something I thought they couldn't get wrong. I honestly have made better food at home...Steak was fatty and tough. Chicken was too chunky and not very flavorful.. Fries were also overly seasoned but probably the best thing on the table... My son's chicken fingers were overly greasy and breaded (would have rather gotten a chick fil a kid's meal)

It was honestly terrible but I am pregnant and was absolutely starving, so ate it anyway. Service was also a solid C. Service was never great here but not bad either. I guess that hasn't changed. Tables we were seated at was dirty, there was no ketchup, and we had to ask for silverware.I could go on but I won't.

I will not be back to this location again."}
{"text":"I went to Taco Mac to watch the Alabama vs Penn St football game and to try it out since it is new.  The game was on Saturday night and the place was packed, but I managed to steal a stool at the bar.  I started of with a Guinness, the nectar of the gods, and ordered some chicken wings, heat level hot, with fries.  I asked the bartender for a side of the death sauce just to see how hot it was.  The wings came out pretty quickly, but my side of death sauce was missing.  The wings were pretty good.  The bartender checked and saw that I didn't have my side of death sauce, so he went to check on it.  I finished my Guinness and asked the bartender for a recommendation of another stout.  He recommended the Jailhouse Stout which was a special.  Guinness is the nectar of the gods, but Jailhouse Stout is what they drink when they run out of Guinness.  Smooth and creamy with a hint of coffee.  It made an excellent counter point to the rest of my wings, now with the side of death sauce (which to me was hot but no where near death).  I finished my wings and was looking for a palate cleanser something light.  Unfortunately they were out of Pilsner Urquell, but the bartender had another recommendation which turned out to be very good.  I can't remember the name of it, but it was a wheat pilsner that was great.  I would probably go back to Taco Mac, but not on a busy Saturday night.  The food was OK, they have a massive number of TV's and the bartender was very knowledgeable about the beers he was serving."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is slow. The past 3 times we have waited over an hour to get our food. Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Visited T.Mac with a few friends to have drinks and quick bites. Our server Sam was extremely attentive and patient with the extreme & varying personalities at the table.

We all ordered the wings which were well prepared & delicious. Nothing goes better which hot wings than an ice cold beer. This also appears to be a great place to watch sports so hint hint.

I would definitely return again if in the area and the seats are long enough for 6 people so large booths. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!! 
How is it possible to be ignored constantly, even when you are clearly trying to get someone's attention. A friend and I decided we wanted to try Taco Mac since we have heard so much about it, BUT I wish we never walked into this place. First off, our server took forever to get to us and we watched them stand around and talk. Once we were greeted, we asked about the tacos and any specials. Our server simply said \"Everything here is great, you can see the taco choices in your menu.\" WHAT?!?!?! We clearly asked for some form of advice as to what we should order! After getting our drinks, we ordered wings and tacos in hopes that the food would make up for the lack of service. Unfortunately, that was not the case! Our tacos were wrong and we asked for all flats for our wings and of course we didn't get all flats. We were hoping our server would come back and check on us so we could correct the issue, but we didn't get that chance. So we ate what we had and left TOTALLY DISSATISFIED!!!! A piece of advice for management, come by and touch your tables!!!!! Get better servers, who actually care about what their job!!!! Even after sharing our horror story with our hotel, they still insist that we give them another chance. I'm sorry, I refuse to pay for service like that and to receive the wrong food!!!"}
{"text":"One star is one too many for this location. I meet my fiancée here two years ago so we came back to celebrate w a drink and a meal today. After 20 minutes we had not even been greeted. Then when we asked to see the manager and the waitress talked to him he walked the other way. I had to chase him down just to express my displeasure. Save yourself and the wasted time. Don't stop here."}
{"text":"I visited this place randomly as the first restaurant my party was interested in going to was a bit too crowded.  I hadn't read the reviews, but I had always heard talk of this place while attending school, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

When I first walked in, a nice fella had opened the door for us.  When we went to see the hostess, they were nice with seating us, but they weren't as friendly as hostess' usually are, so that's fine.  The service with our waiter was great though.  I say kudos to him.  Service is very important to me, and he was always spot on with that.  He also seemed very knowledgeable of the menu and the beers included.  He was always pleasant checking up on us the whole time we were there.

The atmosphere was very chill.  I thought that the restaurant was laid out pretty well.  There is definitely not shortage of TV's, let me tell you that!  Everywhere I turned, I was always able to have a TV in sight.  Not bad if I were a huge sport fanatic.  The booth that I was in felt very comfortable.  It was a big booth, so I liked that I had a lot of elbow room to eat.

Now the food, it wasn't the best food that I've had.  I feel like I could have had better food eating at home.  The chips and queso that we had ordered for an appetizer made me a little sad.  I just love queso, and this just didn't hit the right note for me.  The cheese felt like it wasn't melted that great, so after about 2 minutes, it started getting hard to dip.  I had ordered the Burrito Mac and wasn't very pleased with it.  It didn't really have that much flavor, that umph!  The only thing that I did really enjoy from my plate were my fries.  Sad, but true.  Maybe I just wasn't feeling it that night.  

I don't think that I would go back here unless friends really insist on going here for lunch or dinner.  Maybe if I end up going another time months from now, my opinion will change, but I hope they will still have the same waiter."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with my last visit being that Taco Mac was my son's favorite restaurant. The restaurant was fairly empty but for whatever reason it took a long time for someone just to even acknowledge that we were sitting at the table. When our drinks finally came my wife had what seemed to be gum or mucus in her cup. When we let the waitress know she moved the cup over to an empty table across from us and asked \"so what would you like to eat\". I'm not a person that looks for sympathy or a free meal but I do feel that was one of the most disgusting things I have seen at a restaurant and for it to be brushed off in such a manner was disturbing. Unfortunately for my son I don't see us revisiting his \"favorite\" restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come watch games, hang out or to host a fun party. They have different optiosn and party plans - or just bring a crown and go dutch. Whatever your plan is, TMAC can accomodate you. The food is plentiful and affordable, but great quality. 

This location is really pretty large - plenty of room for everyone. TVs are EVERYWHERE! I love their selection of domestic, international and LOCAL beers. While they have food options for everyone (bar-food lovers, vegetarians, meat-lovers, or health-conscious...), here are a few of my favorites.

~ The Mac & Cheese was so creamy & cheesy
~ The steak quesadillas were stuffed to the max with deliciousness
~ The wings & sauce were complimented with a deliciously thick ranch
~~~~MAKE SURE YOU ORDER YOUR WINGS EXTRA CRISPY! 
~ The onion rings were crisped to perfection
~ The sweet potato fries were SO good
~ The chips & salsa, along with the salads, were perfect appetizers.

Definitely a bar & restaurant I'm happy to recommend. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the food was great."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are really good and the TV for everyone is really great. Try boneless wings. 
Side dish: if you dont mind a little sweet then you should try the sweet potato fries. 
Ranch and blue cheese compliments everything."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food and beer selections are vast.  Never had a bad meal or service.  Being a sports bar theme you must be okay and prepared for loud patrons who are watching their favorite teams, especially on SAT and SUN.  Overall four stars"}
{"text":"Place was clean, prices were reasonable and service was slow. We sat at the bar, the bartender was nice however he was slow. I noticed only one bartender so maybe that was the issue. We didn't eat anything only had a quick drink and it was pretty cool. This was my first time here so I will definitely be back to eat and give it another try."}
{"text":"This could easily have been a terrible review. But thanks to our server (Darien-sp?) it was very enjoyable. 6 of us checked in at 6:55 and were told 20-25 minute wait. We saw MANY empty tables but still waited. Finally at the 45 minute mark, we were ready to leave. Our table was ready (one of the many we had seen) right then so we decided to stay. Darien explained to us that there were only 3 servers in a packed house tonight and that he appreciated our patience. From that point on, it was excellent! He took very good care of us, in spite of being run ragged, and the food (most of us had wings) was delicious. Mis-management is the only reason this review is not 5 star."}
{"text":"While the menu looked good, my husband and I couldn't wait to taste any of it because the volume of the tvs was so obnoxiously loud we had to leave. I actually got a headache from sitting in there for 5 mintues. I felt bad making the waitress cancel our order. It doesn't matter what game is on, some people go to your establishment just to eat and enjoy themselves and they can't do that when they can't even hear over the loud tvs."}
{"text":"I like it here.  If you like sports there are flat screens anywhere you turn.  The food is what you would expect and there are a ton of beers available. The place is pretty big too and has a nice outdoor space.  Parking is easy too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a wide selection of beer in the Huntersville area, Taco Mac is not a bad place to be.

One of my favorite parts about Taco Mac is that it has TVs OUTSIDE on the patio to serve those of us who like the outdoors AND football :)

The food isn't anything to rave about, but it's decent bar food. The skimp you a little bit on the guac, which is one way to make me grumpy, but the good outweigh the bad here.

Also, if you order the beer of the month on Thursdays, you get a free pint glass!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin!!!! We drove from Asheville, fished in the sun all day at Lake Norman. Drank a few beers but nothing crazy. Then went back to the hotel to Uber to a concert. On the way my friend found out his dog has cancer. I love that dog!!!! Don't worry I'm getting to the review of Taco Mac - you need the back story....
We got to the concert via Uber because we figured we would drink & I would never drink & drive! Well once we got there neither of us were in the mood to drink surprisingly. We both drank at least 4 big Diet Pepsi's from 7-10pm between the 2 of us. 
We leave early because I can't stop crying all night & we were both tired from the drive & being in the sun all day fishing then the concert - we are both in our mid to late 40's, not kids anymore. 
We arrive back at our hotel that is 0.1 miles from Taco Mac. We decide to have some food if they are open & have a beer before bed. So I drive over there. There are roughly 5 employees at the hostess desk when we arrive just standing there. We go and sit in the bar area. Then shortly after Richard who I can only guess is a manager of some sort comes to the table & asks questions the 1st one being did you drive or Uber? Did you go to the concert? I thought it went to 11? ( it was like 10:45 ) Have you ever been here before? 
This bothered me. I've worked in the  the restaurant industry for over 20 years I knew what he was getting at / doing. Now I wouldn't mind but we showed no signs of drinking. If he was checking for being old, tired & sad yes - drunk no!!!!! My last beer was at 5:00pm almost 6 hours prior. I was so bothered so my friend asked him why he asked us that - he said he can tell that we've been drinking and it was his years of bar experience that lead him to that conclusion. We did not correct him because in reality we had been drinking that day just not currently. So we ate & left - oh I had a beer too, a sour that was flat. 
And the food wasn't good either - we ordered fried wings with dry rub. They were not dry rubbed - they were fried & seasoned after. Not sure how but not dry rubbed. It was a dry rub but not executed properly ( again I do have 20 actually 30 years Restaurant experience) Wings sucked!!!! Service sucked!!!! Customer Service sucks at this place for sure - took forever to get our food & drinks while the bartender was eating wings behind the bar &  washing glasses as we waited for our drinks then one of the beers they didn't have the keg was kicked. So my friend didn't even drink!!! 
Richard was totally off base & out of line. I don't think his past restaurant experience lead him in the right direction tonight. I will never go there again! It was an awful - he was awful! Servers were sub par so the experience all together sucked!"}
{"text":"Great beer! Beer of the month is one of the many reason I keep coming back. Food is good! Service for me has always been great. If you are looking for a game this is the place to be. Tons of tv's."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Typical mid-tier bar food. There are variety of options so for sure you will find something you like on the menu. Same goes for the beer, great selection for all tastes. The staff are super friendly, which is always a plus"}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game. If it is a big event, arrive early. They don't take reservations and wait times can get in the 2+ hour range. 

The place has an awesome amount of NICE TVs, one from almost every vantage point. Seriously, I think they have more TVs on display than Best Buy. If this place didn't have such nice TVs, I would have probably given it a 3 based upon everything else. 

If you like Duke, steer clear, every time I have been it is Carolina turf.

They have every beer known to man, and this comes at a price. There isn't a cheap beer on the menu. Coors Light was the cheapest at $3. Most I saw were in the $5-$8 range. We usually order pitchers to keep costs down.

Mixed reviews on the food. I had their chicken sandwich with the avocado on it one time, and it is the best thing I have had on the menu. Don't get the fish and chips or chicken tenders, I have had friends order those and say they sucked. The fajitas were good

Location is nice, located in the roundabout in Piedmont Town Center, the area has an European flare with outdoor seating and condos above the shops. The building is spacious, and offers 2 levels of seating.

As for the staff, I have no real gripes other than when the place gets packed. I came for a Carolina/Duke game one time with standing room only, and was wedged near the section of the bar where the drinks go out to the servers. I began watching the staff more than the game, it was utter insanity behind the bar, no true leader and everyone pissed at each other. Reminiscent of Lord of the Flies."}
{"text":"Poor service and poor management. Spent an hour waiting for our food with almost no other patrons at noon on a Saturday. Took the manager 30 minutes to respond. No drink refills. Asked for ketchup 3 times. Will not return."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is absolutely terrible. Waited like 30 for my check and 15 minutes to get it back. They weren't even busy. food is over priced too. Good beer list though"}
{"text":"I typically am not someone to write a review after one visit, however Taco Mac is not my typical spot so I highly doubt I will return. I attended a work event which was very well organized. We arrived and were brought upstairs to a spacious room, overlooking the downstairs bar and tables. There were multiple TVs and a great amount of tables which we rearranged for our group. We had multiple servers that were great. We ordered pitchers, because there is a great beer selection, as well as individual drinks for the non-beer drinkers. Each table was served chips and salsa, which I can say was the best thing I ate while there. The salsa has a great kick and the chips were fresh and salty, just to my liking. We had preordered a variety of food items that were setup buffet style. We enjoyed quesadillas, wings, chicken tenders, hush puppies and onion rings. The wings, in my mind, ugh! I thought the quesadillas were no worth writing home about, no filling. The hush puppies, horrible. However, the chicken tenders were large, cooked in a light batter and delish. I do wish they offered more dipping sauces, as we only received Dijon. Overall, I think if you are looking for a great place to watch a game, enjoy a beer and have some decent food, Taco Mac is your spot."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. We love the roasted wings and the beer selection. Everything else we've had on the menu has been mediocre. Tonight, our wings came out and were cold to the touch (parts were lukewarm, while others were actually cold in spots to the touch). We sent them back and I immediately ordered another beer to cover me during the wait. About 10 minutes later, after I had to ask the server if the beer was on its way, he finally brought it. 

The manager did come over right after we sent wings back to apologize and said it would be 5-10 minutes before the wings came back out. We got them about 20 minutes later. While they were warm this time, the order of 20 was short by 2. In their defense, I tried one before I sent them back, but the other one just disappeared, I guess. 

The fastest service we got was when we asked for the check. It showed up very quickly. I wish I could say the same about everything else. Based on the food the past couple of times I've eaten there, I'd be surprised if this place is around in another year, which is unfortunate, as the roasted wings CAN be really good (sometimes)."}
{"text":"Arguably the best selection of beer in Charlotte.

Now for the not so great stuff, starting with the outrageous prices.  I'm willing to pay a premium for some hard-to-find beers, but $6+ for a bottle?  This isn't NYC/DC/LA, give me a break! 

Their wings are terrible.  The boneless wings were little, over-cooked turds of dried-out chicken that appeared to be sitting under a heat lamp for hours - tough as leather too.  Their roasted wings were chewy and disappointing, but not nearly as barf-eriffic as the nachos.  Any sports bar with a beer menu like this needs to kill it on the wings if they're going to get some street cred, this place makes Pizza Hut's wings look like Gordon Ramsay creations.

The atmosphere and facilities are okay, I will give them that.  Tons of TVs with sports in every corner and the bar area is large with plenty of high-top tables and seating options for your happy hour crowd.

The biggest issue I have with the place is its lack of identity.  If you want to be a neighborhood sports bar and grill, be that - but don't over charge and stuff it full of pretention and expect me to sing your praises.  In a nut shell, this place is a much more expensive version of Wild Wings Cafe or Buffalo Wild Wings with a greater beer selection and crappier food."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but always seems to disappoint in one way or another.  Usually it's the service which is slow, inattentive and just plain aloof most of the time but this time it was the food which is mediocre at best. side from their burgers, which are surprisingly badass and the TVs, I don't know why we keep coming back lol!"}
{"text":"Lots of TVs and Big Selection of Beer.

Hosting a  tons of beer on tap, there will always be something new for you to try.  Apparently, if you sign up for there free members card, they will keep track of the beer you order their for you.  If you get above 125 unique beers, you will get a special mug to drink out of.

With the massive selection, the beer is a bit on the pricey side.  Ranging from 4-6$ dollar for a draft micro brew.

Check the paper updates to their beer list. Also if your a fan of pale ales, try the heavey seas - powder monkey if they have it."}
{"text":"This is bad. This is really bad. I have a place barely a mile from my home that offers 200 bottled beers and 140 beers on tap. They have food. They have outside seating. They have inside seating. They have so many TV sets tuned to sports that you might never miss \"a\" game, forget about \"the\" game.

None of the distractions like at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, this place is about the beer. Yep, the food is good too. So far, my favorite salsa in Charlotte. Also, the Turkey 'Cue sandwich is good.

Parking can be a bit of a pain, since it's Piedmont Row. But that can be conquered. (It's the idiots who put their Chevy Tahoe in a \"compact\" space that bother me.)

Let me know when you're here - I might be here too. :-)"}
{"text":"I've always gotten good service from most of the servers and the food is good.  One of the servers named Senait always goes above and beyond for us.  The part that has been the greatest is the attention that they give to my two babies.  As a single father, I often come in to eat at night and get a break because they give so much attention to my babies and it makes me feel good to see the treatment that they get.  Senait sometimes even holds my babies and plays with them and I am able to eat in peace.  I've come here with groups before as well, and she is always very attentive to the needs of those at my table.  I plan to come here for the years to come because of the good treatment that we get.  There are restaurants everywhere and many of them have really good food, but no one has given so much attention to my babies before which is one of the reasons that I have come back so often."}
{"text":"I went back last week for pint night, and was disappointed to see the service got worse, not better.  Pint night was explained differently by two different waiters, we had a difficult time flagging down our waiter and to top things off he spilled a beer on my iPhone, and now it is having some issues.  I know accidents happen, what was aggravating was the \"who cares I just spilled beer all over you phone\" attitude.

If service continues to worsen, I don't care how many beers they offer, it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"All the way around terrible:  buddy ordered the wings and the reviews were correct. It looked like they killed 4 pigeons and scattered the wings in a basket.

Guacamole was literally brown. 

Service:  lame. Had to finally ask for silverware. 
Ordered an old fashion. They came back ten minutes later stating \"they did not have the correct ingredients!\"  Shrimp looked like something out of a grocery store frozen food section. 

I could go on....but this place was so bad I couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"I ordered Taco Mac through GrubHub and it took 40 minutes longer to get my food than I was originally told and I don't know who's fault that was but no big deal  the food on the other hand is not good the zucchini and Mexican Street Corn was amazing! The Mozzarella Sticks were disgusting! The breading was so weird! I also ordered the chicken quesadilla and it had hardly any cheese and all the chicken was extremely dry
I won't be ordering from here anymore"}
{"text":"Again the food was terrible.   I have eaten here 4 times trying something different each time hoping I'd find something decent.  No dice.  If it was not for the incredible  beer list and amazing amount of TV sports I would not come here at all.

 I ordered the wings which they tout as their specialty. I can name several spots in the area that are much better. They were big and meaty for sure.  However they were just fried and thrown in a basket. Not tossed in the sauce at all. There was a microscopic squirt of sauce in the side of the basket. Even if I wanted to dunk the wings in the sauce myself i could not because there was not enough of it. Just terrible. 

Lastly the bar tenders are brain dead. All of them. The personality of a log. 

Thank heaven for the beer."}
{"text":"It's been a year since we tried this place.  It was a Monday night and after an hour wait I called for the manager.  Told her we were leaving, that I needed to get my family feed.  She said she had fryers down and food would be out shortly.   We left.  Won't be back.  Service was terrible and the beer was warm."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Large selection of beer too! They even changed our tv to the Ranger game :)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and food! I went to Taco Mac with several coworkers during one of the Concert Events and our server was the best. We were in a rush and he made sure that we were in and out in plenty of time. I would recommend Taco Mac to anyone!"}
{"text":"My first time here! It's good bar food, decent bar service, and they have a cool rewards program to make you feel like you're joining a fraternity! Free beer glasses on Thursday nights!"}
{"text":"I made my second visit to Taco Mac with a small group of friends. The beer selection rates 5 stars the food rates 2 stars. Great place to watch sports events. There must be 75 flat screens in this establishment.

A number of the tables in the bar area have their own tappers right at the table. You just start pouring and a counter keeps track of your consumption. No waiting for the server to order another round.

Great place to go with a group. The appetizers and the one entree we ordered were a dissapointment."}
{"text":"what a truly chain bar..crappy food, average service..overpriced drinks.  think stadium quality everything at a restaurant and you will be happy there"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at Taco Mac. I chose the All The Way Nachos, which were pretty good. THE SERVICE SUCKED!!!! I had to wait on 15 minutes for anyone to notice me! Finally the bartender realized I had not been help and said something to the host. The host brought me a menu and said that my server would be over shortly. I had to wait 10 minutes before she and came over. I ordered a water, which took 5 minutes to get to me! These times are not being exaggerated by the way. My server finally came over to get my food order after another 7 minutes. The food came out fairly fast, but my server was still nowhere to be found. She finally showed up to ask me about my nachos once I was half way done. She disappeared again and didn't return until I was finished. She immediately returned with the check as if I was totally done. Before I could put my card in the book, she came by to inquire about my payment 2 times! That was the most I had seen her consecutively since I got there. Where was this urgency during my meal? NON-EXISTENT!!!! THIS WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND I WILL NOT COME BACK!"}
{"text":"Well unfortunately I find myself needing to write a review that was not 5 stars, too tell you the truth it did not have to be that way.  The setting is good, like a sports bar you may find in Boston or I guess Buffalo (in a nod to the owners) and from what I saw the beer and alcohol would fit any bill and with over 100 coke products on tap . . . you can't go wrong there.  But then there is  the general feel of the place.  Everyone that worked there looked bored, not enough people in the place during a late lunch to keep them busy and maybe a little too much time to go before happy hour starts.  The food was bland . . . even in the 5 star review below they say the food was just ok and he was being nice . . . 

It's just a place that might be great during the games, but if there is not a game on . . . or you have no interest in the game . . . then you are in the wrong place.  I am sorry to all those people out there that love it, but it might be a good place to stop by after you have eaten . . . or if you just want to be by yourself and have everyone else leave you alone."}
{"text":"Came here for their 35 cent beers night, wish I had just stayed home. To be fair, I showed up at midnight so I expected a crowd, but it seems like they offered this great deal but weren't prepared and weren't really able to deliver. My friend and I went to the bar, which was packed with people, but there were only three bartenders so we couldn't get served. After about 10 minutes I asked one of the bartenders for an Angry Orchard draft and was told they were out of them. After that, we decided to just sit at a table and try to order food. After a good five minutes of sitting, no server, so I told the hostess we had not been served. When our server came over, my friend ordered a shock top and I asked for a margarita, she said their blender was broken. Before I could open my mouth to ask for anything else, the server just walked away and went to another table, so that annoyed me. When she finally came back, I asked for an Angry Orchard bottle. The bartenders then started walking around saying it was last call even though it was only 1am and they closed at 2am. It would've been nice if they had told us this when we walked in. My friend and I asked our server if she could bring us two of the drinks we ordered since it was last call, she said she couldn't. After she brought our drinks, she put them down and walked away, not even a \"do y'all need anything else\", so I decided not to give her any more business and didn't get food. I then went to the bar to try and get another drink myself. My server cornered me at the bar and asked what she could get me, I said I was getting another drink. She said \"oh, I can get that for you.\" I was baffled, she had just told me she couldn't do it, and seemed like she was annoyed that I had gone to the bar. After about 3 minutes she came back and said they didn't have any more of my drink so I was extremely annoyed. While all this is going on and the restaurant is complete chaos, the manager was chatting it up with his buddy, didn't even walk around and ask guests how everything was. 

I have been a server before and have no problem tipping well and cutting slack because I know how hectic the job is, but our server was extremely lackluster and didn't seem to care at all. The management was no help and the whole situation was unorganized. I've never had their food, but I don't plan on going back to try any. I wish I could give this place zero stars."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great fish tacos.  Great chips and queso.  HUGE beer selection, my goodness!
Not so good wraps (rice and chicken in the filling tasted a bit cheap).  Or maybe that was just a bad day, don't know."}
{"text":"Ah yeah ... where shall I begin? This is yet another restaurant with the word \"taco\" in the name but serves some god awful thing trying to pass as taco with an american fusion flare. Apparently a lot of people here like that foolishness. Not me. I like my mexican food and asian food unassimilated. This joint is a man cave on steroids. Lots and lots of tv's and beer. Food is bar food, period. My man loves this place, but then again he lives on chick-fil-a and panera bread. Want great tacos, go to Midwood."}
{"text":"My family went there last night for the first time.  One complaint, the parking spaces are the smallest I've ever seen, you better not go there in a monster truck, think I'll take the Mini next time.  Place was packed and we were told a twenty minute wait. I was sorta glad to see that business seems to be doing well cause that part of town has had several  restaurants go under recently.  Anyway, we got a table after about 15 minutes. Oh, wow, this place has more TVs that anyplace I've ever been in  its sorta neat to try and take it all in. IMHO they've done a great job remodeling a old steakhouse. Anyway service was outstanding(I think I gave our waiter about a 30% tip.  He was that good)  The food was outstanding, the wings were the BEST I've ever had. And the beer was great.  And I thought prices were very reasonable.  We'll diffidently be back.  Certainly makes my list of top 10 restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for lunch. We were seated quickly and received great service. However, I'm not sure what Taco Mac is trying to accomplish with there food varieties. Feels like they are trying to be a higher end Applebee's (Mexican, wings, burgers, sandwiches). 

We had guacamole and salsa to start, which were OK. My daughter had the chicken tenders which were great. My wife and I shared the roasted hot wings and the chipotle ranch burger. The wings were good and the burger was OK. 

I has a couple different beers which were good, but served in a glass that is not equivalent to a pint (somewhere between 12 and 14 ounces). 

My wife got a moscow mule which was overly sour and a Long Island ice tea which was really good. 

Overall, we would likely choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"My server was very good, even though it was very crowded in her section. Everything was really great. I've never been to this location before, but I would come back here. The service was awesome and the food was fresh. My server was Guirely. Very attentive."}
{"text":"This location was the worst Taco Macs we've ever eaten at! The Georgia location and the location in South Park were great! My husband and I got food poisoning after we ate here. Really slow service..we should have walked out after we waited 20 minutes to get our water and heard all about the waiter being overwork. Never again."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Used to get the chicken burrito but it got worse and worse. Then they stopped selling my favorite dessert, the chocolate chimi. Service is lacking. Won't go back."}
{"text":"After heading back to Taco Man several times since my first review, I must amend and give another star. Every time I've been, the service is stellar. The food just seems to get better every time and the beer is always cold and good. Although Taco Mac is a chain, they do it right. The patio is great and you still get good service, and the upstairs area allows for some great people-watching."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in after the Hornets game on the way home.   Was a little concerned with it being late at night as service usually goes down as the night gets later.  However we met Sandy who was awesome.   Even though she was busy she took the time to answer all of our questions about the menu and everything came out in a timely manner.  She was very friendly and polite even though she was slammed.  Thank you for such great service!!!  Ps: thanks for adding the lemon pepper to my buffalo wings!!"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my rating due to a really bad experience last night.  I guess that the \"secret\" is out on Taco Mac glass night and my normal running crew planned to be there to run a quick 1.5 mile run specifically around the apartments behind the Taco Mac and then go in to enjoy a beer or two to cool down and have some laughs.  Our main goal was to get the free glass - which was a glow in the dark skull glass....  

We sat down and waiting a good 10minutes before someone even approached us - I don't know if it was because we were all sweaty, or whatnot, but the waitress was nice enough and we ordered - specifically asking for the beer selection that would get us the free glasses.  At first our waitress said we all had to sign up for Brewniversity... which was not the case last time.  Some of us were already members anyway, but that was the first sign of trouble.

Later another server came with 1 beer.... I thought it was strange.  But just ran with it.  It took them about 10min to finally get all the other beers.... between all the servers... there were about 3 trips to get all the beers to the table.  The last server brought a huge tray (ended up with 3 extra beers that he took back to the bar).  Anyways, everyone had their brew and were somewhat satisfied.

Usually once they bring the beer, they bring the glasses with it... but not this time.

I made sure when we ordered food to ask our waitress if there were glasses left... and she said, \"YES\".  It was really hard to get her when we needed something as well.  Refills and other orders.  Super annoying.

Food didn't take that long, but once again,it came piece meal...and some of our orders were wrong.  Halfway thru eating the waitress came back and said they were out of glasses.  She kinda gave us a half apology and tried to be cute about it... but man, what a disappointment.

I think because of the busy night, the service REALLY SUFFERED.... and for that.. I must update my review.  May have to think twice about TacoMac before returning... but what a sour note to end a supposed fun evening."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and beer.  

Had the fish tacos and loved them.  Good selection of beers on tap.  

TMAC is a chain.  But it's worth a visit for decent food and beer."}
{"text":"What can I say? The soda was good, the wings were good, the hot sauce was good.  Everything else...nothing to write home about.  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, it didn't look or taste good. The sandwich was supposed  to have blue cheese on it (three crumbles is not blue cheese) the lettuce looked withered and the tomato look as though it had been sitting out all day.  My shoes were sticking to the floor and looked as though no one cared to clean under it.  Someone with me had a side salad which had practically no dressing on it and the waiter forgot to bring the appetizer, so we had our entrees before the appetizer.  All I can remember is leaving very unpleased at what had just transpired.  Taco Mac has lost a customer unless I want some wings...but then again there's wing stop and wing zone if you like wings!"}
{"text":"The only way to describe Taco Mac (piedmont row) is hit or miss.  I've been there a BUNCH as it is right here in our neighborhood and I can tell you that the best thing, hands down about this wing place is... the beer.

Selection is great, price is what you would expect to pay for quality and the obvious over head of a place that large in SouthPark. 

The wings and boneless wings are good, sometimes excellent, sometimes downright cold by the time they make it to your table.  Maybe that's because I'm only a pledge in their Brewniversity and therefore are not privy to warm wings like the brothers.  I'm not playing pledge-invaders tho.  I draw the line. Inside joke.

The best sauce is \"Hot.\"  The death is a very very peppery version of hot with some additional heat but I can tell you I never died, nor did I ever require a sip of milk, maybe it's spicy to some but I'm not impressed.  2nd best sauce is Habanero BBQ, although they must get mild habaneros as this sauce lacks heat as well.


Will I be back, certainly, it's close by, doesn't completely suck, and unlike most of the restaurants in southpark I don't need to take out a second mortgage to pay for a full meal for two.

I read another review on here which sucked. The person complained about a SPORTS BAR with TONS OF TVs being busy on game day.  You probably should have planned ahead.

Overall, I recommend you check it out.  Try a couple of beers you've never had before (I laugh aloud when I see people getting bud light bottles at this place, or friggin Mich Ultra.. are you kidding me?) and enjoy the patio on a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"Been a frequent guest here the last 30 days. I would say I have eaten and drank here about 15 times in that span. 

PROS: 
Great Beer Selection (100 beers in tap).

Bartenders: (ALL of them are friendly and quick to serve. Shout out to Tyler especially. I love them all, but in a city where the majority of bartenders are female, it's cool to have a make bartender who is quick witted and fast at pouring a beer. I've also been told by my female friends he is hot. I personally think he looks like Richard Jefferson formerly of the Brooklyn Nets).

Loyalty Program: (You get cool stuff for drinking. I like cool stuff. I also like drinking).

Certain Foods: Buffalo Hummus especially. 

CONS:
Wing Sauce \"Heat\": I wish they had a sauce that was REALLY HOT. Their sauces have taste but PLEASE get one with MORE HEAT.

Bathroom: It doesn't have any pictures of 1970's pinup babes. I know that's being picky, but if I'm going to be in it 30 times a month, I want pictures in the men's room.

Phone Ring: Their incoming phone ring tone is quite annoying. Not....even....kidding.

All in all, I will be going there regularly. If you like trying different beers with sports on multiple TV's run to this restaurant. If you are  a blind Amish recovering alcoholic, I recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"Arrived about 9:30. Requested a booth for 4. We were told the area was closed but eventually sat us anyway. Our server was not too friendly. Asked about one of the wine selections. The reply, \"I don't know anything about it because I don't drink wine.\" Really, you can't ask? Ordered a glass of wine and she returned saying they didn't have any of the wines on the menu because it is changing. Pass on the wine ordered a couple beers and placed a food order. While we were waiting chairs were being put on tables and the floor swept. It was still 2 hours before closing. We cancelled the food order and left. The server seemed pleased that we did."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. Been twice with friends and once for date night since moving to Charlotte in February. Definitely recommend the Chicken Nachos with queso. Rivals the Mexican food we're used to in CA"}
{"text":"We ordered Taco Mac delivery through grubhub on July 1st, Order # 1733434885.
First of all, they forgot one of the sides. We paid $50.89, and we expect our order to be complete. Second, I ordered Hot Dang Shrimp - the portion was microscopic for $11, and the taste was disgusting. We also ordered two different wings, they were ok, that why I give \"two\" starts. Overall, extremely disappointing, will never order or visit this place."}
{"text":"This place is new and different and has a very cool feel to it.

Why they call it Taco Mac I have no idea because it has nothing to do with Taco's.

They have over 100 beers on draft...including Bells Two Hearted ale.

Me and my son stopped in for a light lunch on a Friday...it wasn't busy at all. We sat at the bar and got great service from Hannah.

I had the shrimp and avocado salad...it was tasty but I wish they had taken the shell off the shrimp.

This will be 'the place' to watch a Panthers road game."}
{"text":"10 stars for hiring my son as a host and 4 stars for the rest. Clean, tons of TVs, tons of beers and pretty decent food. Especially when weighed against the truly pathetic Fox and Hound and the entirely average Hickory Tavern that are both nearby. 

Wings are good with homemade blue cheese or garlic ranch dressings. The burgers have a nice char to them and come with fresh toppings. On the service side, they are on point and friendly and the food comes out at a good pace. Nice to have in the hood!"}
{"text":"OK... so the food is your average chain bar type. Big deal. What this place has is a great beer selection and more TVs than I've ever seen in an establishment like this before. even some tables with frigging beer taps built into the table ffs!

Seen some other reviews mention bad or slow service. Say What?!  We received excellent service with a smile and have no complaints whatsoever. 

Best news.... It's almost football season and the next Taco Mac will be opening IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD soon!  Seriously....  Within walking distance in what used to be the horrible Max and Erma's.  Can you get a walking while intoxicated charge?"}
{"text":"Went to TMac on a whim and without much expectation. The menu looked like a typical American Grill menu. To my surprise, however, the food was delicious! Service was prompt. The French fries were hot and appeared to be out of the fryer just 30 seconds prior to being served. Will definitely come back another time on game day!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. If you're a beer lover, this is the place to go! Amazing wings. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not being from the southeast, I'm not too familiar with the Taco Mac brand, but I'm told by other people they are good.  This particular location though, stinks.  I stay nearby on business frequently and this is one of the few nearby choices to have a beer, and due to their vast selection, I come here.  Every time I find myself in this Taco Mac, the service is abysmal.  It usually takes flagging them down to get someone to serve you.  Not sure why this is, I'm guess it's just improper training or laziness on the part of the local management team.  Otherwise, Taco Mac has a great selection of beer and a good looking menu to order from, along with TV's to keep up on all the games.  If they could just finish off with device, they could be great!"}
