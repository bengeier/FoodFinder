{"text":"Terrible!  Small and taste absolutely awful.....expensive as well!  Don't waste your money.  Try Haninis instead...no comparison...cheaper prices 3x the food, better taste."}
{"text":"Today I ordered from this location giving them a second chance from my last experience. I will say that it was disappointing! The 
conversation while ordering seemed promising as the employee was polite and seemed to take my order and my requests (up-charges were not an issue). 

When I got my order I did not get any of the requests that I had asked for of extra garlic sauce or crispy wings. I also did not get the jojo's that were part of my order.

The wings were awful and the sauce was watery!

The only positives were the lady taking my order was polite (although somewhere communication broke down and my order was screwed up) and the delivery man was timely and polite.

The food was awful and my order not completely fulfilled, which is a disappointment since  we have had great food from other locations!"}
{"text":"Always had good wings at the Exchange st. Location. Tried them here and they were tiny wings not cooked enough. I was eating at the adjoining bar and was given my food in to go containers. Asked if that's how they serve food to the bar and was told yes. Looked around and saw other people had food in baskets on their tables. Won't go there anymore!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!! Not only do they delivery but quickly....even better part FOOD IS STILL WARM!!
I've tried numerous dishes A******* all around"}
{"text":"We just ordered tonight. I got a small Stromboli (which was AT LEAST a foot long, and 5\" wide), and my husband got the pepperoni pita. The food was ready in 15 minutes, made correctly, and for our orders plus a coke it was only $14! I think we've found our spot!"}
