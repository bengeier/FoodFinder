{"text":"First of all, you don't want to sit at the bar because you're facing the back of the restaurant that looks like a clean but boring sports bar. If you look behind you at the rest of the restaurant, it's cute. Decor taking cues from the viceroy hotel for sure. Hipster black and yellow, life size horse lamp.
  I ordered a cocktail, the club soda was flat. I also ordered the Cobb salad. Errrrr, it's hard to mess up a cobb salad. I was excited to see \"5 minute egg\" as one of the ingredients as I love a beautiful yolk, but it came out on a square of iceberg lettuce. This is only okay if you've ordered a wedge salad and they disguise this cheap lettuce by drenching it in blue cheese. I cut into the egg... lovely. So, why is my salad sort of watery? Like maybe they rinsed the lettuce and didn't spin it? The whole thing has a slimy feel.  Plus an excessive amounts of pickled onions, which I'm a fan of generally. I'm about to order something else cause I can't choke this down....wish me luck. 
  Ordered the tartare. Interesting and pretty good. Pickled mushrooms and mushrooms crisps on top (yum) but half way through,  there was so much mustard, I got queesy.
  Staff was lovely, it was absolutely freezing, I left."}
{"text":"I came for lunch for a friend's birthday.  The service is A1 and I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of the staff to educate us on what the Yellow Door has to offer.  As a lunch experience, I thought it to be very good, yet, quite pricey.  I don't have a problem for paying prime for a dinner with wine. That being said, I am really excited to experience this restaurant on an evening in the near future.  I look forward to trying their wine tasting and experiencing their cellar selection the next time.  The only reason I've given them a 4 is that I  honestly feel that the menu was a little extensive for lunch (meal size and price). Other than that, I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"Came here because of Avenue Magazine review for best brunch buffet. Terribly disappointed with both the service and the food. We were greeted by a hostess / waitress who seemed to be in a perpetual bad mood. Most of the \"hot\" items (hash browns, sausages, etc) were stone cold. A total rip off for 24 bucks. Save your money and go to Carraigehouse Inn, Thomsens or any of the other options in town."}
{"text":"We went to Yellow Door for Sunday brunch. Their buffet had a good variety of options including eggs, pancakes, cheeses, sausages, etc. We should have probably gone with that option instead of the menu items... I had the steak and frites and my boyfriend had a duck confit hash. The steak was really good, but the confit was extremely salty and had tons of cheese which made it hard to taste any other flavor in the dish. I had the macaroon for dessert and I wasn't crazy about it. It was a huge macaroon with a fruity filling, it could have used a lot more softness and something creamy to balance the bitterness of the fruit. Service was great and food was served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I'm quite disappointed with this \" high end \" restaurant. Food took over an hour , and it wasn't all that great. My steak was over cooked I did mention it to the server, she just said \"oh sorry bout that\" ... Paid almost $50 for over cooked steak! VERY pricey not worth it at all...."}
{"text":"Staying at Hotel Arts. My room service meals from here are incredible.  Hot , fresh, fast delivery and the best part is the genuine staff who bring your meal.  Staff asked about my stay and when I told her my story she came back with a couple snack items for me - from her own pocket.  Would absolutely dine in the restaurant or order takeout"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had the flames gameday special.  Great service from the bartender and delicious steak frites/salad combo."}
{"text":"Had brunch here while staying at the hotel and it was delicious! Everything was cooked to perfection (which is hard on a buffet) and our server was great. The baby pancakes were so cute and delicious!"}
{"text":"great restaurant, great service, amazing atmosphere
 we especially love the sunday brunch"}
{"text":"The entire experience blew us away. Started in their Yellow Door restaurant for a dinner after driving back from Lake Louise. 
My wife walked in and the Maitre DE who looked like a character in a local play could not have been more gracious & accommodating.
Our server Adrian guided us through outstanding menu selections.
Service was over the top incredible.
Has to be in the top 1% of any restaurant in this Province.
And for all the uppity snobishness around Vancouver dining establishments, eat your heart out over Calgary's Yellow Door."}
{"text":"I came to Yellow Door twice, once on a late Sunday morning brunch with a couple friends. The brunch food was amazing and I really enjoyed how classy and clean the place was. The second time I came by was in the evening for some dessert and the vibe was great, it wasn't too loud so I could actually have a conversation with my friend and enjoy the food. Overall, it is the best place in Calgary I have been for brunch and dessert. I will definitely come back to Yellow Door and bring important people to converse in conversation and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Was tasty but pricey, which I expected. The service was excellent. I suppose I give it a three out of five because there were not too many pork options and the options I did choose were not as amazing as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Came for a nice dinner with the wife who is a foodie.  We both enjoyed the food and service.  Very decent portions. I enjoyed the Cobb Salad - maybe a bit heavy on the blue cheese. The roast duck leg was very nicely prepared. Atmosphere was mature but lively. The decor is kind of neat - better than the previous incarnation (we were sad to see that close since it was where we held our wedding reception but happy to see this nice establishment take its place). I have also had lunch here before. Very nice. Hopefully they keep it up."}
{"text":"Did the 5 course chef tasting with wine pairing. Food was good and wine pairings were pretty good as well. Its a very good value for what you pay. This is a good option if you want to do a chef's tasting for group 4-6 people without having to paying through the nose. Great service"}
{"text":"We went for the Christmas dinner. We had our 18mth old son with us. Our server was great. Very accommodating to our young family. The food was great. We all enjoyed the atmosphere. Between courses we could step out into the hotel and let our son run some steam off. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We're ladies who love to lunch, well in this case - brunch! Enticed by things such as chocolate chip pancakes, smoked salmon eggs Benedict and breakfast bowls, who wouldn't love brunch?
Add a few mimosas and you're set!

You can tell on the presentation of the food that they take pride in the fresh and quality ingredients that they use.

The furniture and pops of color from flowers and throw pillows gives this place a modern bistro feel - great food paired with great atmosphere make the experience that much better."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Calgary. Each time my girlfriend and I come here, we get the chefs menu and it's always delicious. Each time we have been served by Adrian, and he's an excellent server. Always great service from him. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"My mouth had an orgasm tonight. The outstanding dish was the cod, which is the best fish I've ever tasted, including shore lunch when I was learning to paddle a canoe back in Manitoba."}
{"text":"We finally went to Yellow Door for Sunday brunch. We heard about it from a few people but kept forgetting about it since we normally don't go for brunch downtown. Glad we ventured out of the suburbs and made our way to Yellow Door. Worth the trip.

Their buffet had a great variety of options including eggs, pancakes, cheeses, sausages, toast etc. etc. Loved the salmon eggs benny and the super cute pancakes too. The presentation of food items is what I love. My husband isn't overly crazy about it and as long as its great food and lots of it - he is happy. The presentation and all the breakfast items we tried were fantastic. I can't complain about anything.

The d√©cor is top notch and the service was fabulous as well. Steller experience from arrival to departure.

Will be back again since I hear they do change out their brunch items quiet often. Can't wait for next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

As a brand new restaurant, I was excited to check it out. But quite a few restaurants these days underwhelm me, despite the hype. So this is just my honest and constructive feedback. 

I dined here during Big Taste, and it was good. Nothing extraordinary.. Just good.

We were a party of four. We had the $35 dinner menu, which consisted of a salad, a main and a dessert. The great thing about Big Taste is that it gives you a good idea of the menu, the prices, the quality etc of a restaurant before going and splurging $100+ on a meal there. 

First, the food. The salad was a fancy carrot and goat cheese salad, which was quite tasty, but it was very small. The regular menu says it is $12, which would be quite painful to pay. For my main, I had the lamb shoulder with polenta and supposedly baby vegetables. I say supposedly because my dish did not have the vegetables.. It had a tomato salsa-ish type of thing instead. The lamb was quite good, and the polenta went well with the lamb, and so did the tomato side. However, my friend who also ordered the lamb dish, was disappointed he did not get the vegetables. Two others at my table got the poached dover sole as the main. This was supposed to come with a mussels, clams and shellfish veloute. The dover itself was a fairly good size of fish and was cooked perfectly. Tender, buttery, and delicate flavours. Very enjoyable. However, it was sitting on two or three prawns, one mussel and no clams.. a tomato-ey veloute with a few miniature sized vegetables. Guys, come on. If I read on the menu that my fish will be sitting on 'mussels, clams and shellfish veloute', I am expecting something there.. Literally one mussel, 2-3 prawns and no clams does not a shellfish veloute make! 

The dessert was quite nice. It was a brownie with vanilla ice cream. Not what was mentioned on the website at ALL. Anyway, it was very, very rich and the ice cream was great. 

The service was a bit funny. One waiter seemed rather stiff and awkward and so did the waitress giving us the bread. She gave us whatever bread we wanted on our plate and took the bread basket away. Nowadays when I go to restaurants and cannot decide on a wine, I ask the sommelier for a taste before I order. The sommeliers are always more than happy to do that because if I am going to order a $15 glass of wine, I better enjoy it. I did the same here because I was tied between two Italian reds. They said they would have to charge for the tastes. It was odd because most restaurants dont do that... Anyway, it all seemed very penny-pinching and exacting here at Yellow Door. No bread basket on the table, charging the customer for a taste of the wine before they order, the extremely small portions.. The atmosphere seemed very cold also, not a warm or inviting atmosphere that usually makes for happy experiences. The waiters/waitresses did not smile or make easy conversation.. 

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and the food is good. Would I be back though? Not entirely sure. I am currently not sold on Yellow Door Bistro, but we will see."}
{"text":"So I have yet to stop by for the food, but I always end up here after a brunch on the weekend. My wife and have a tradition that goes back to our dating days where we would grab an Irish coffee after finishing our brunch. Now, we've tried them all of over the city but yellow door has the best one. Completely deconstructed, the cream, coffee, and Irish whisky, all come as its own piece. Then you get to mix it all together (I recommend throwing in all the cream first so the coffee will melt it) and have a magical alcoholic and caffeine infusion. Next time you're in the area, try it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch here. I was meeting a friend who was visiting Alberta from Hawaii and was very glad I chose Yellow Door Bistro for our visit. The food looked and tasted fabulous. We had excellent service and comfortable seating that allowed for a nice long chat. I heartily recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because it is probably one of the best places I've been in Calgary so far. The staff is very friendly. The hostess gave us a nice table with a lovely view. The decor and set up is very chic and trendy, with sculptures, art pieces, very comfy booths. Our waitress had an extensive knowledge of the menu and she took perfect care of us during our feast. The background music is suitable for the occasion, nice slow tempo trip-hop. The only downside, and the reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, was the timing between our appetizer and the main course. It took way too long. I'm a server and I know how the industry works. The place did not seem that busy and still we waited for our main, other than that. I would definitely recommend this place if your nearby."}
{"text":"Chef Duncan Ly is an artisan who's passion in his work shows in every dish he creates. I had the chance to enjoy a dinner at Yellow Door Bistro recently so here is a run-down of the evening:

We started the meal with a couple salads. The heirloom carrot salad is a beautiful array of ribboned carrots as well as sous vide baby carrots that are briefly grilled for colour and a touch of caramelization. Add to that a light frisee, some nice goat cheese, a citrus cardamom dressing and a roasted almond foam and you have a very fresh and wonderful start. The Dungeoness crab salad was also very tasty, featuring flaky crab meat with tender butter lettuce, green apple and charred grapefruit. Bringing everything together is a light and refreshing coconut citrus vinaigrette that brings a little Southeast Asian breath to the dish.

The wild prawn cocktail is Yellow Door's interpretation of this classic, and often badly executed dish. You won't find the martini glass and ketchup-like cocktail sauce here. There is simplicity in this dish that plays on the elements of a classic prawn cocktail, including the heirloom tomatoes with their ripe sweetness, complemented by the bite of fresh horseradish and the firm meatiness of the wild prawns (stripe prawns?).

The Petite saddle of lamb is very well executed. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the meat is incredibly aromatic and flavourful with that signature lamb 'perfume'. Set atop a bed of du Puy lentils, which are also notably cooked perfectly, holding that texture so that each lentil is distinguishable, but tender. Bringing the dish together is a lamb au jus, which is a treat to experience, as you want to make sure you get it on everything. 

The technical skill in the food here is top notch, and as a cook, it's the care you take in the details that makes a dish sing. The following dish is no exception. The Noble Farms duck cassoulet is a rustic, rich and hearty main that features duck 2 ways, confit leg and sous vide breast. If you're reading this and your heart just skipped a beat, there's also pork belly. The beans are buttery and complete the composition of this true departure to decadence. I felt a little guilty eating this, but not guilty enough...

All in all, I was greatly impressed by the quality of the food and the presentation of the dishes. The carrot salad, in my opinion was the memorable part of the Yellow Door experience. Service was also exceptional, as the servers were very knowledgeable about the food and beverage menu. Each dish, when brought to the table, was clearly and thoughtfully presented and explained. It was a great date night and I highly recommend Yellow Door Bistro to anyone that hasn't been."}
{"text":"Breakfast at the Yellow Door starts with a complimentary shot of the daily smoothie. On this day it was carrot based and delicious. $15 gets you the continental buffet which is a variety of pastries, a small selection of charcuterie, fruit salad, yogurt parfaits and a make your own steel cut oats bar with a variety of toppings. There is also table side service of toast and bagels if you order from the server. The pastries were good (the cranberry white chocolate muffin was very fresh) and the fruit salad had a good variety of different fruit. The charcuterie was very dry from being left out too long - both the cheeses and meats were fairly inedible. I feel that for the price there should be more variety, or the things left out should be better maintained.

Also ordered a side of fresh grapefruit which is served grilled and warm. Was told it was a half portion so ordered two thinking it would be one full grapefruit. Out came 2 whole grapefruits (4 halves) and was charged for both though it wasn't my misunderstanding, but the misinformation from the server. Meh."}
{"text":"Came here for some cocktails with a lady friend, while waiting for an event at Hotel Arts to start. For the short while that we were there, we were very well looked after, and our waiter was extremely friendly and kind. Despite their fancy-rustic ambience, the price point on the drinks was similar to what you'd find elsewhere in downtown Calgary.

I would come back here on a date, or drinks with the same friend :). Some of the cocktails are named after the bartenders! Try one and make sure you make eye contact with the guy it's named after, while you sip. Because that's not creepy at all. ;)"}
{"text":"Being guests at the Hotel Arts this past weekend, my boyfriend and I naturally decided to start off both our nights at the bar here. The bartender was really nice and helpful. We ordered two different cocktails - the one with tequila in it and the sangria. My boyfriend and I both preferred the one with tequila - so much so that we had two each both nights. It's fun watching the bartender prepare drinks as they aren't simple. Some involve a lighter to orange peel and sprinkes of cinammon etc. We also shared the which were seasoned perfectly and yummy.  Can't comment on any of the other dishes but overall I enjoyed the space at the bar."}
{"text":"Very fancy-pants type of place!
We ended up here before 5pm on a weeknight to celebrate a couple of things and wanted to go to Raw Bar. So, we paid to park on the street (so convenient, right out front!) and were so excited as we had wanted to try out Raw Bar for quite some time BUT they were closed for a private event. Sad face. We made the most of it and went to Yellow Door in the same Hotel (Arts) and thankfully, we were dressed appropriately. The place may be a tad too fru-fru for some (for example my dad in his day would have turned on his heel and walked out!), but we just wanted a drink and some eats. NOT the kind of place where any kind of Happy Hour is found, and likely not the type of place where wait staff expect a measly 15% tip, right?! 
We had a seat just off the bar and were met with 2 half flutes of prosecco - deelish, nice touch! 
The menu for before 5pm is verrrry limited. I was dying for some seafood so to share between the 2 of us we ordered the dungeness crab salad with butter lettuce and the seafood rotini (dried pasta, not fresh). There were the only 2 seafood items they had at this time. The sizes were acceptable and the flavors were good but the seafood is a little sparse. In the pasta you get 2 shrimp, 3 mussels, 3 clams and 2 small bites of trout for $22. The crab in the salad was... ok for $16. House drinks (cocktails) were $12 (they do not carry cranberry juice?)and hubby got away with a beer for $7. We took a look at the full menu and may come back for a late night dinner one day down the road. The huge imported black horse inside the restaurant is a must see and the little Le Creuset coquette of delicious little chocolates at the end made getting the bill just a little bit sweeter.
3 stars, all the way!"}
{"text":"Such a fun dining experience, came to yellow door bistro on a whim with a girlfriend. We initially wanted just appetizers but ended up with real food. 

We sat at the bar as the restaurant was suprisigly empty. It was a Tuesday night but people eat during the weekdays no? The head waiter was this cool looking guy with a thin mustache and his hair slicked back lol looked like a villain from batman or something.
 
He made sure we were happy with everything and made recommendation which I literally live for. If the staff hate it then it must suck right? We ordered a beef dish can't remember the name but it was delicious and the potatoes were awesome too.

Loved dining here, went back for the big taste a few months ago and got the chefs choice/plate and they made accommodations for me not being able to eat pork. I'll be back just haven't had the time!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Christmas party with a group of 10. The staff was extremely accommodating, helpful, and laid back and helped us make a few decisions on a three course dinner with wine pairings--which by the way, is very reasonably priced. It heavily featured duck that was cooked to exquisite perfection, with beautifully paired wines and well crafted sauces.

Major attention to detail at Yellow Door--the right cutlery, the right stemware, great little rooms for groups, intriguing decor.

The staff really goes above and beyond. We had one or two in out group that perhaps were.. slightly more jolly than the rest of us, prompting an owner visit at one point. But, to my surprise, they were incredibly accommodating and friendly, making us feel right at home despite the upscale environment.

Yellow Door is a restaurant that appears laser-focused on the guest experience, which can be a hard thing to find at upscale dining in Calgary. Call ahead for your group and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"the ambience and decor was nice as it is part of the Hotel Des Arts
However their brunch wasn't flavourful and  their menu didn't have many healthy GF options"}
{"text":"I came by to inquiry about a party I want to host for 25 adults and 10 kids. Upon talking to a service manager I felt that the team really wasn't interested in hosting a party. Mind you, this party is during 3 to 6 pm. They weren't interested as we had kids as part of the group."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch. The restaurant itself is quaint and there is a lot of room between tables so it is possible to enjoy a quiet conversation with your tablemates.

The buffet is very impressive with a wide variety of high quality offerings that were all delicious- pastries, muffins, charcuterie, yogurt parfaits, fish cakes, fruit, a wide variety of eggs include eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, oatmeal & the \"fixins\", french toast, quiche and desserts. The only negative about the whole dining experience was with food temperature. Every \"hot food\" item that I selected was tepid at best. The Bailey's french toast that I had were positively cold. Hot food served hot will raise the buffet to 5 stars.

Our server was excellent and we wanted for nothing. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. Amazing service, really great food, and the decor makes it perfect for snapping artsy photos of yourself or your food! Highly recommend for a brunch with friends, a cute date, or to pig out on their buffet!"}
{"text":"I have horribly inconvenient food intolerances: eggs + milk. 

They're in everything and very hard to avoid. 

The Yellow Door was extremely accommodating and even comped my lunch when I had to wait a long time for my food. 

They made me a non-menu flatbread and it was delicious. 

Many places are rude to me because of my food issues but the Yellow Door went above and beyond. 

Very impressed. 

Five stars"}
{"text":"Yikes - had no idea I never reviewed this gem. 

I ate the best steak and frites here. The fries were perfect - crispy and mealy inside. Nicely seasoned with a wine reduction that took me over the edge. I also really enjoyed the cobb salad. It was refreshing, the flavours were subtle but still lively. I also ate one of the most amazing desserts. It was like a refine, deluxe twix bar. This post does not do Yellow Door Bistro justice, but I'm tired, and have no more energy. Sorry Yellow Door."}
{"text":"Voted on is Calgary's best brunch spots, I was excited to try this place. Buffets are usually disappointing, but Yellow Door does a great job with offering unique dishes alongside the usual. The day we went, the dishes included your standard scrambled eggs, sausage, Bacon, eggs Benedict, breakfast potatoes, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt parfait and pastries. The special dishes were a croissant strata (really delicious), mini coat cheese and red pepper quiches, beef sliders, and there were a few small desserts. These guys use the delicious eggs with orange yolks, not this pale yellow or liquid stuff. Brunch is $24 (or $15 if you don't go for any of the hot selections). Includes juice, coffee, and tea. 

The service was truly exceptional. The guy serving us was very friendly, and genuinely seemed to enjoy his job. 

The price is fair as this brunch is definitely a notch above the regular brunch items. And don't be afraid to call ahead and ask what the selections are for the day! We did, and the girl on the phone was awesome and happily listed everything.

When we are staying at a downtown Calgary hotel again, we will definitely be back. When compared to other \"hotel-style\" brunches, this place is definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was invited to this bistro with some friends, and as a vegan, I called ahead to check their options before accepting the invite, especially since I could see it is a pricey bistro. The hostess who answered asked if she could take a few minutes to ask the chef, and said she would call me back. Sure enough, she called back in a  few minutes and described a yummy sounding dinner with zucchini noodles, sauce, and some veggies. It was priced at $18, which I did think was steep for the ingredients, but it sounded good and interesting, so I went for it. 

But then, when I actually ordered, I referenced our earlier conversation and said that I would have the vegan option with the zucchini noodles, etc, and she did one of those, \"Oh yeah, about that...we don't have that but we have a nice pasta with veggies.\" Well, I was not pleased, but now what could I do but smile and say \"Sure?\" so that's what I did. And I paid $18 for a bowl of corkscrew pasta, with a very very few pieces of onion and bits of tomato, and some herbs. I can't explain how disappointing it was. 

The worst is that I called and was told one thing, and then was given another. For a restaurant that bills itself as serving exciting, innovative food, the chef ought to be able to do better than what I was serving my kids when they were toddlers. If not, then it should be priced more appropriately, like 4.95 or something. I get it that not everyone is vegan, but come on. If you're a professional chef or restaurateur, then you ought to be able to imagine a plate besides plain pasta. Beets and garbanzo beans on a bed of grain with a nice sauce? Tofu stir fry? A bed of greens with navy beans on it and lots of veggies? These are all extremely simple and any vegan would be happy to see these types of nutritionally complete and interesting plates.

Needless to say, I won't be back, and that means neither will my family of five non-vegans, nor our extended family, nor my neighborhood dining group, etc. Sorry, yellow door, all the cocktails and fancy lighting in the world won't make up for that!"}
{"text":"We had never been here before and decided to try out the brunch on a Sunday morning. We made a reservation for 10 AM and I dropped a comment in the reservation box saying that it would be really great if we were greeted with a Happy Birthday (my partner was celebrating his 45th). Mission accomplished. The manager seated us, wished him \"Happy Birthday\", then the server came by and seconded the birthday wishes and brought us a couple of complimentary mimosas (underpromise and overdeliver).

The brunch buffet was delicious -- standard fare: muffins, pastries, eggs, bacon, eggs benny and some wonderful extras (mint strawberry pancakes, a very popular croissant/bread pudding and tiny mason jars filled with berries, yoghurt and granola). As a great finish, they brought out a birthday dessert with a customized message written on a sheet of chocolate.

The decor was bright, fun and modern. There are some big, funky chairs scattered throughout the restaurant -- they look neat, but I can't imagine they are conducive to holding a conversation (I saw a gentleman get up and swap the big chair for a regular one).

Overall, great first dining experience (at a very reasonable price) -- we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the mini pancakes. Weren't fluffy, they were like stale biscuits. Besides that rest of the food was really good."}
{"text":"I visited the Yellow Door Bistro for a work function before the holidays.  For a hotel restaurant, I would say Yellow Door is above average.  Great ambience and decor.

Many of my colleagues had the buffet and seemed to enjoy it.  Due to dietary restrictions, there wasn't too much on the buffet I could enjoy, so I opted for the prosciutto omelette with egg whites.  Personally, I was underwhelmed.  I found the food to be greasy and heavy.  I think that the omelette needed some more veggies, or at least the option to build your own.

This would be a great spot to go with out-of-town guests, and I'd be interested in eating dinner there.  But I personally would not go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday & did the Brunch Buffet & split the YYCBurgerweek burger. The brunch had a selection of fruit & some fresh baked danishes, cheese & cold cutes; hot steel cut oatmeal with a selection of toppings; yogurt parfaits; scrambled eggs, potatoes with caramelized onions, sausage, bacon, eggs benedict, margharita pizza & pancakes. The bar served as the buffet table & though the selection may seem limited the quality of the food is excellent. I much prefer a limited choice but excellent quality. Everything is made in house. The eggs benedict were the best I have tasted in a long time, the yolks still runny though served at a buffet and the sauce perfect. The coffee is an excellent full-bodied roast unique to Yellow Door.  Service was excellent and our waiter Heath was attentive and there when necessary and brought us juices, teas and refills of coffee when necessary. Bacon lovers must try the buffet brunch if only for the bacon. This is one of the best brunches I have enjoyed, it is a well-rounded selection and not so over-whelming that by the time you try and taste everything you are full and can't really go back to get the stuff you really want to eat more of. The pancakes were tiny loonie-size served in tiny enamelled cast iron pots with their own lids to keep them warm. They were served with a delicious caramelized banana sauce. Each serving was 4 min pancakes, enough to taste and tantalize without making you feel guilty about the carbs you are ingesting. The YYCBurger was a BBQ braised Spring Creek beef cheek, celery root remoulade, arugula, pancetta and heirloom tomato on a homemade bun. The beef cheek was melt in your mouth tender but needed a little more salt, the bun was excellent and the fries were pretty good, most of them crisp on the outside. All in all the food was excellent and I would definitely go back to try their regular menu offerings."}
{"text":"Shared an array of delicious appetizers and fine beers. Cozy and hip atmosphere. Obvious attention to detail in the menu and meals."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but unfortunately our experience has not been great.  First of all we showed up at 4:45 after a conference and were told we had to wait to order from the dinner menu for 15 minutes.  Hmmmm....wait to order after several other customers that came after us got their order in? We asked for a couple edits on salads, like no avocado and no bacon, it came with the avocado (no big deal as it can be picked off.  My girlfriend is vegan and asked for a salad with no sugary nuts or the fruit and could she please get avocado and extra veggies? The server wrote it down and it still came with both and the only addition was tomatoes.  That being said it took 50 minutes to get our salads...can you say hangry? Our main courses finally came after 1.5 hours and the only saving grace was our server, and i will admit the food was good.  Don't come here if you are hungry cause while it has gotten busy in the past half hour, even when they weren't, everything took forever."}

The food was so delicious! I love that they offer a \"chefs choice\" for when you don't really know what you want and are looking to try something new. I suggest the spiced pear martini and the spaghetti and meatball! Sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Booked brunch at the yellow door for a friends birthday day celebration.  Have to say that every one that seated us and served us were very accommodating and help full. Food was great and it was all finger side portion so normally I would only hit the buffet one maybe for a half a plate more but I found myself going up to the buffet 4 times just to nibble on things. Because they would run out of things. But because of the set up I found it was a small selection and food was on the cold side. 
Favourite part was the little glass jars of jam and jelly."}
{"text":"First time here at Yellow Door Bistro for Sunday Brunch and it was delicious. 

Selection ranged from yogurt parfait, lemon pancakes, roasted potatoes, bacon, sausage, eggs cooked with yogurt, Eggs Benedict, muffins and vanilla Panna cotta. Standard coffee, juice and tea for drinks. 

Dining area super modern with funky chairs (Modern not sure). Tables decorated nicely with small shot of strawberry smoothie. 

Service was fantastic and they will validate parking so bring your parking ticket. 

Overall great selection and priced at $24 for adults and $12 for kids. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Yellow Door quite literally has a yellow door and the decor inside is just as adorable, it always reminds me a little bit of Alice in Wonderland, it's a little whimsical and overall very cutesy. The menu is great, although it can be a bit on the pricey side. If you're wanting to stick to a budget though they often participate in the prix fixe menu events the city offers which is a great way to sample the menu. The food is excellent, everything I have tried there was put together with care, very tasty and memorable. A great date night spot for sure."}
{"text":"Great Chef's choice for 3 course meal. The dessert could have some improvement. But great appetizer and main course. The service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Went for the breakfast buffet this morning. Cool decor and spaced out so I wasn't in anyone's way. Our server was a little off her game, having to be reminded to get the things we had already ordered, but very friendly.

There was a decent selection of food with toast and cereals being brought to your table. A wide selection of olives and pickles to go with the cheese and meat selection but only two kinds of cheese and two kinds of meat. Also a large selection of nuts and dried fruits for oatmeal. 

There were amazing mini lemon meringue pancakes, traditional eggs, bennedict, sausages and bacon. There were monte cristo and Reuben sandwiches but they were cold when I got to them. Tasty despite being cold.

All in all, I expected a little bit better of quality and service but I would come back to try it again. Everyone has an ordinary day now and then :)"}
{"text":"Ew. I have never been so underwhelmed. We had the duck fusilli and the bacon and clam pizza type dish. I'm currently suffering massive stomach pain, totally flavorless meal. It wasn't worth spending the money here. Go to Proof, it's better, the service is friendlier and you don't and up with stomach problems. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is scrumptious!!  The dill hollandaise is worth the stop alone.  The benny selection is on point.  Pretty good cesars and mimosas too!! But the best part of our dining experience was the staff!! So friendly and accommodating to our different requests and questions. 
The portions are perfect.  The decor is really chic and very clean.  There is a buffet that looks incredible and will have to try next time."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and have mixed thoughts. As a vegetarian the choices on the menu are limited but yummy.... but then I had the chef do a 'chef's choice' type meal once and it was basically - well, vegetables... which is not really overly creative and WAAAY to light.... It's funny how some chef's equate 'vegetarian' with 'I'm on a diet'
which is not the case at all for me. 
The ambiance is super great and the service was professional and succinct, albeit a little bit cold..
Definitely worth a return visit. Hope to see some more vegetarian options in the future."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations for finding something to eat at this restaurant as they listed nothing vegan on their menu.  However, they impressed me, the chef make some zucchini \"pasta\" dish which was very good and I had a flatbread without pesto and parmesan with artichokes which was good, but not amazing.  The others I was with went with meat options and did not seem to be big fans of their meals, but the off-menu vegan friendly option was a hit for me."}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here during Big Taste Calgary week.  Whether you are driving by or walking in from the outside you can not miss this restaurant.  It has, as it's name sake indicates, a rather obvious Yellow Door.  Awesome.

We had a 3 course menu including an Heirloom Carrot and Goats Cheese Salad, my entree choice of Braised Ewe-niversial (lamb) and a Chocolate Fondant with a delicious ice cream for dessert.  Everything tasted fresh & lovely.  The lamb was moist & delicious.  

What impressed me immensely is the moment I was seated and visited by the server, I was handed an Ipad.  The Ipad is their beverage menu.  What a great concept & kind of fun for the first few minutes.

The service was stellar and I loved the decor.  It's very European & whimsical with romantic undertones.  All in all a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great experience, our server and host was Sebastian and excellent food knowledge and perfection of the dining experience.

I had the halibut and it was cooked to perfection, the gnocchi that I ordered was not what I expected, Italian Style but rather Persian style which I didn't really care for, they were gummy and flavourless.

Definitely a dining experience with exceptional service and flavour bursts to blow your pallet."}
{"text":"The place is spacious, and the service is good (you can see the servers are professional and courteous), otherwise it would get a 2-star rating.
We went to Yellow Door for brunch and I cannot say I enjoyed any part of it. 
The buffet has very limited choices, and the egg benedict simply smelled bad.

If you are going for a buffet brunch in downtown Calgary, there are lots of other choices for the same price. Not going back."}
{"text":"Unimpressive.
We had a girls night out, during Big Taste of Calgary and thought this posh spot would be a good place for drinks and a bite to eat. The wine list for glasses is quite limited, but bottles is extensive. Selection is mediocre at best. Cocktails really saved the day at the end of the meal. $35 for 3 courses sounds like a steal! Menu:

Course 1
Heirloom Carrot and Fairwind Farms Goats Cheese Salad
golden raison, orange cardamom dressing, toasted almond foam
Course 2
Braised Ewe-versial Lamb Shoulder
creamy corn polenta, baby vegetables, natural jus
Course 3
Mini Treat Platter
cream puff, chocolate cone, creme brulee

Well the salad was extremely small. For the price we expected small portions but it was a degrading amount of salad. The almond foam could have been anything but almond, and was really just tasteless foam.

Lamb was a bit dry, and honestly very unimpressive for a piece of lamb. It was hard to finish because it was just really boring. It came on a bed of polenta which was equally unimpressive.

The only good things that came out of this dinner was the Valrhona chocolate cake, and the exceptionally friendly staff. I hope this isn't a reflection of their regular dinner menu, as we all felt a bit cheated, even for a $35 dinner. 3 stars for effort, and perhaps growing pains. Parking is also a pain."}
{"text":"It's a really nice looking place and very swanky. The food though is standard but priced too high.
I had the crab salad which was good but lacking crab. I also had the tuna pasta which was pretty dull and very under seasoned.
My wife had the braised spare rib which was actually good though! 

Look It's a cool place and the food is ok but that's it."}
{"text":"I came in to kill some time and get something to eat. I ordered the burger, which was perfectly fine. The fries seemed a little strange, but they were good too. Great service."}
{"text":"Fun quieter spot downtown Calgary. We wanted a spot where we could talk and enjoy a quiet dinner with out hipster wait staff. This is the place! Food was beautifully presented, seasonally fresh and delicious! We started with a mixed drink perfectly mixed by the barista. Went with salad and Beef tartare. Then on to the main of Salon and Arctic char. Both were excellent. 
We enjoyed the mix of dinners of local and out of town guests. A few weekend events were happening in the hotel adding fun display of fashion.

I would just like to see the food servers smile more.
We definitely will return ."}
{"text":"I ate here several times while staying at the adjoining hotel and have nothing but excellent things to say about the place. Decor, staff and of course the food were all top tier. 

At dinner the highlight was in the incredibly savory \"deconstructed chicken coq au vin.\" Very creative both visually and flavor-wise. I highly recommend. 

At breakfast I can say I had the best fruit salad I've ever had. They have a preparation technique that air seals the melon to create these intriguingly dense melon pieces that are rich in both color and flavor.

This restaurant could easily complete with the elite in New York City. A true hidden gem in Calgary. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came here for our annual Christmas party with a bunch of friends. The ambiance was definitely not what I expected. I'm still not sure what theme they are going for as the place felt very modern but sterile and a little stuck up. But once we got seated and met our server I felt more at ease. Our server I must say was amazing. She was so kind and patient with us. She walked us through the menu and offered a very honest opinion. She was so much fun and I have to say a special thank you to her for making our night.

Most of us opted for the 3 course meal as if you have the 5 course it means everyone at the table has to in order to time it with the kitchen. The first course was a pate which was very small but good. The main course was duck. Now I've never been a fan only because its impossible to find a place that cooks it properly; this was the most amazing and delicious duck I have ever had! It was cooked to perfection! It will keep haunting me until I come back for more. The dessert was a carrot cake which was also fantastic. So moist and sweet.

We were definitely a more 'merry' party and the owner (i'm assuming because he was the only one dressed in a suit with a bright orange bow tie and fancy mustache) came by to help clear plates and check on us. But not once were we made to feel unwelcome or out of line. And it was nice to see an owner of such an establishment helping out and being involved.

I will definitely be back but i'll admit, mostly for the duck..."}
{"text":"How can you not have a fabulous night in a place as cool and chic as Yellow Door! The room is just so fun, so chic, so well designed. The staff is just fantastic and the menu (while I only had an app) all looks lovely. 

I also have to say, I came in on my own, lap top in toe and used their free wifi to get some work done while enjoying a wonderful glass of wine. It was perfection of a spot for this! 

This is most definitely one hotel restaurant that is way above the average. Even if you are not staying in the hotel it is worth checking out for lunch, dinner or a drink and dessert. If you are over at the BMO Centre or Stamp grounds, it is definitely the closest  nice restaurant and worth the stroll."}
{"text":"We had stayed overnight at Hotel Arts and of course it was one of the coldest days of the year so decided not to venture out for breakfast.  Instead, we headed downstairs to the Yellow Door Bistro.  The decor was beautiful and I loved the big HORSE statue!

We opted for the a la carte menu and chose two delicious items:  Eggs Benedict w/Smoked Salmon and Pancakes with Caramelized Bananas and a a dulce de leche whipped cream.  OMG!  Both dishes were amazing.  So tasty and very filling.  Their coffee and tea selection were great.

Service was very attentive and we had a great time.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not too bad.  The atmosphere is nice (seemed very Etsy!), the staff seemed very nice, and the food was okay.  I like food, so when I go out, I want to get tons of food OR it needs to be very delicious or have unique flavours that just work well.  We had the three course meal.  It started with (what is basically) deep fried crab meat shaped into balls, surrounded by tartar sauce (of course, they made it sound much fancier).  Main course was smoked trout with gnocchi.  I seem to be finding all sorts of chefs around town mixing non-traditional meats with gnocchi.  Smoked fish and pasta... just doesn't work.  The wife had the porchetta.  Porchetta is meant to be fatty, but this slab of meat was about 85% fat and 15% meat.  It came with undercooked carrot slices.  For the dessert, it was cheesecake with peanut crumble and raspberry puree sauce.  The flavour was exactly like peanut butter and jam sandwiches-- which looks fancy but ends up tasting like a child-made dessert.  In the end, it was good, but not my favourite.  Hopefully if a friend recommends a better entree there, I'd go back to give it a second try."}
{"text":"Its been a few weeks since the boyfriend and I had a date night out and I thought the Big Taste gave me the opportunity to check out Yellow Door Bistro. The menu looked delicious online, but fell flat in person. We had ordered the big taste menu, the scallops and short ribs, and shared everything. We found the flavours mediocre and the short rib actually a little over cooked. The best part of the entire meal was the almond dessert from the big taste menu. 
The service was a little bit awkward, but we didn't really have any real complaints. Decor was lovely and we were given a great table with lots of privacy and a street view."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went during their weekend brunch buffet.
It's a bit odd when you walk in because there's a huge horse, but the overall decor of the restaurant was very eclectic and cool. 
 You get the choice of ordering off the menu or choosing the buffet. We walked around and looked at the buffet choices (all you can eat eggs Benedict?!) it was a no brainer. 
Once we chose the buffet, the server came by with a sample of their smoothie which was a really great addition to the brunch. I normally would've never even glanced at the smoothies they had but I'm very happy I got to try it!
It was around Christmas so they had gingerbread waffles, amazing raspberry panna Cotta with fresh fruit, eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage, scones, and so so so much more!
They even had mini loaves of bread. It was very good, the wait staff gives you time lots of time to eat, go back for another plate, and eat more. Coffee refills come with the buffet, too. 
I'm pretty sure it was around $27 a person, but for how much food we got, if we ordered off the regular menu it would've been much more expensive. 
I'd definitely go back, and since it's connected to the hotel arts, if you're staying there you don't even need to go outside in the snow!"}
{"text":"Tried Yellow Door Bistro for their Easter Sunday Brunch \"Enhanced\" Buffet.  Cost was $35/person which includes coffee/tea, a complimentary smoothie shot, handmade ketchup on the table, & the lovely spread of food and dessert.  Oh yes!  They also validate your parking ticket upon completion of meal.  Parking is right in the parking lot beside the hotel.  

On to the buffet: there were breakfast items like muffin, pastires, chacuterie with cheese, mini goat chees quiches, steel oats with toppings, wonderful scrambled eggs with goat cheese, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, ham, bread pudding, potato salad, fruit salad, cold seafood like shrimps, clams, mussels, king crab and smoked salmon.  Dessert: macroons, mini cupcakes, to die for carrot cake, hot cross buns & pana cotta cups.  All the food was wonderful!  

The only 2 things I have to say about the buffet are that there aren't any greens at all, a nice, healthy green salad would make the buffet complete & the food platters are way too high on the bar table.  For short people, it's really tough to see what's in the heavy lidded Le Crueset casseroles.  

Wait service was good and quite attentive.  The food comes out in small batches which keeps it fresh.  The chefs and wait staff keeps checking and replenishing the food."}
{"text":"Interior/Design: definitely a 5 star. It looks very fancy compared to most fancy restaurants I've been to. It was also the first thing I noticed when I came in. Whoever designed it knew what they were doing.

Food: The lady took our order and we started off with complimentary bread and bread sticks. The bread stick was too salty for my liking, but the bread was good. We got the Twice Cooked Fries as an appetizer and it was alright. It tasted like what it sounds, chips basically. For my main course, I got the Carrot & Ricotta Gnocchi which was okay. It was too cheesy for my liking, good thing it came in a small serving. 

Service: This was the reason I gave it a 1 star out of 5. I noticed that when I came in to the hotel, no one greeted us or acknowledged us in any way, which was okay. I didn't mind it at first. We got to the restaurant and got seated, the server didn't seem helpful when we asked about the menu. Her responses made it seem like she didn't wanna be bothered and we were wasting her time by asking questions. Then when we finished our meal, one of the meals were undercooked (pork chop) and we told one of the servers who took our plates, and he literally said nothing, he just took the plates and left. When we we're about to leave, our server didn't even say anything, not even a \"have a nice day.\" And the whole time we were here, our server failed to acknowledge our presence. You would expect to get better customer service at restaurants like these but I was very disappointed with their customer service. The worst thing is that it wasn't just our server, but everyone in the restaurant & hotel that we came across. I've been to other restaurants and have been treated 100x better."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my experience here for sure, not sure if the food was the best part about it but would likely return.  The manager and all the staff we interacted with were very personable, and the decor was super modern but at the same time pretty warm and comfortable.  An interesting note is how the menu is a standard paper menu but for drinks you get handed an iPad - a novel idea but its actually not very helpful as you have to click down into and back up from menus so you get a bit lost in the process.

Food wise I would say this place is above average for sure, but not sure I would put it in my list of 'must go' for Calgary just yet.  For this visit, got the tuna tartare which was really good (not the best in Calgary), bacon wrapped halibut was nothing special, and a specialty burger stuffed with duck that was fantastic.  The drinks were awesome, got some of the specialty cocktails (got with with Laphroaig which was sneaky strong) and wine and all was good on that front.

As said, it was good, has potential, will probably come back for another try at some point."}
{"text":"We've come to Yellow Door Bistro a few times now as we have enjoyed the great service, the unique decor, and the delicious food.  We tried the tasting menu with wine pairings and very much enjoyed the duck.  Great place to try some new food and feel classy doing it :)"}
