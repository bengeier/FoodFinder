{"text":"Very Good Loma Saltado for $13.50. I felt like the prices were average for a traditional Peruvian Cuisine. Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! Great stuff! Try something new and different if you're not familiar with peruvian cuisine. I was very pleased with this place."}
{"text":"A review I really don't want to write..... The food was very tasty and exactly what to expect for traditional Peruvian cuisine.   The prices however were far too high given the portions. For $13.50 my Loma Saltado had 3 oz of meat at best. At this price I would say \"Where's the beef? The $7.50 Chicarrone Pescado con Yucca was also way too skimpy in the portion size but at least a much better value than the Saltado.   Lunch for two with 2 glases of Chicca Morada, the fish/yucca appetizer, and two plates of Loma came to $43 with tax and tip. Way too much to spend for lunch. We were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time. They need a lunch menu.   I'm sorry to say that at these prices this establishment will not make it. The excellent food alone will not carry it. Please reconsider your menu and pricing vs. portion size. I will not return at these prices. I will return if prices decrease substantially or portion size increases substantially."}
