{"text":"Went to see a buddies live show tonight at the 6th Street Pub N Grill.  The night started off great. Grabbed a few drinks and listened to the band. After the band concluded, my friends and I continued to get more drinks.  We had a lot of laughs and fun at the bar until one of my friends unexpectedly got cut off. I would understand if my friend was extremely intoxicated, but that was not the case. Some red head chick, that worked there cut my friend off for no reason.  After doing a shot, my friends and I had a few laughs and chatted a bit. That was until, my friend went to order another drink and discovered she had been cut off from the bar. When asked why, they simply said she was too intoxicated, which was not the case. Out of the whole crowd we went with to the bar, she is probably the biggest heavy weight, which was why this cut off was so shocking.   It seemed like my friend got cut off for laughing and having a good time at the bar.  Basically, if you want a drink at this pub, go to the bar and act pissed off. If you're having a laugh and good time at the bar, you will not get served and possibly even cut off.  Just a forewarning. Cool renovations, but I will definitely not be attending this bar again."}
{"text":"Green chili burger was delicious but HOT. Sweet potato fries were crispy with a hint of cinnamon which was a nice touch. The staff are always friendly"}
{"text":"Had fish tacos with a side of sweet potato fries and shrimp bisque soup. Omg the fish tacos were delicious but one thing it lacked was some heat. I added some of the chipotle mayo dip from the sweet potato fries I had as a side. That made the tacos taste even better. The soup was good albeit alittle  bland. All in all the food was good and will probably return"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Liked the atmosphere, plus close to home.  Only ate the nachos and they were an epic fail.  Go to the trouble of making your own chips and then destroy the dish by - as usual - foregoing an adequate amount of cheese, keeping things cold in the middle, winding up with more wet, cold toppings than chips resulting in a cold puddle of condiments in the end. Soggy and cold nachos with fancy home made chips? Sure! Go to 6th St!  Will try something else on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Restaurant Takeover show on food channel. Since I work here I gave it that first try and was surprised but no surprised to find that they have amazing food and $5 pints!   They always change their daily menu and I have grown to always get their soup of the day. It's only $5 comes with two slices of bread, great for a quick snack or meal.   Their burgers are amazing , the catfish tacos are savoury, and the buttermilk southern fried chicken in creamy mushroom sauce is to die for.  Great staffs too!"}
{"text":"I work in the neighbourhood and this is probably the best spot to grab a beer and a bite to eat. Their prices are reasonable, pints on special are $5 tax included, and the menu is small and well executed.   I would give them a 5 but i'm not a huge fan of their deep fried pickles and those are a a deal breaker for me. They were cut a little too thick and the fried batter fell off each piece before I could get it in my mouth. Also, fish tacos looked great but were a little on the bland side.  The daily soups are always delicious, and I also recommend the wings, especially the cajun lime ones!  All in all, great atmosphere and decor, good food, and cheep (but good) beer!"}
{"text":"Friendly people working the bar and sitting on the customer side, and a good beer list with lots of tasty craft options. Didn't eat the food, but the guy beside me at the bar was eating a burrito which looks pretty awesome.   Not that familiar with this area but if I were in this neigbourhood more often I could see it making a good local."}
{"text":"Yes - a new Pub & Grill in the neighbourhood! Anxiously waited for the paper to come off the windows of this newly renovated Etobicoke location - finally got a chance to check it out a few nights ago.  The designers did a great job - the place looks cool, yet still welcoming. A couple tables in the front, including a big one perfect for groups, with the bar spaced nicely away. Even more tables in the back including one set in an alcove, great for a little more privacy.  Just ordered some beers and a Shrimp Po' Boy. The sandwich was delicious and the fries were excellent - nice and crisp. I was adventurous and tried the \"Apple Beer\" - little too Apple-y for my taste, but glad to try something different.  Great first experience - I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to 6th Street Pub Saturday morning for brunch. I was really excited to see they offered brunch and wanted to try it out. I didn't realize they had gotten a new owner which is probably why my experience was DRASTICALLY different than the previous time I was there. The restaurant had 3 Tables with us being the 3rd. It took 30 Minutes to get my cup of cold coffee. It took another 30 minutes for my food which was missing half the ingredients. When the ingredients were added they were raw and just thrown together.  The Server was trying his best and I could tell that he cared. He was in the KITCHEN trying to TEACH the cook how to make the orders.. Here is my beef. THE OWNER WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME.   Instead of helping run food or make coffee - basically help his staff support his customers in his restaurant; he was at the bar chatting to a friend and just staring at this server.   If the owner doesn't give a crap about the very little customers he gets I don't give a heck about ever going there again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very inviting and homey. Went on a Saturday lunch and it seemed to be filled with regulars. The bartender was nice and offered great product knowledge. Plenty of beers on tap along with great beer specials. I had the special of the day. It was not what I was expecting but it was still really good. I would definetly return and recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This review system is so flawed on Yelp. Some jerk gives one star to a place because his friend was drunk and/or annoying enough to give the bartender reason enough to cut her off and he gives 1 star to the business. People's livelihood depends on Yelp because people don't look past the stars when they have many choices of restaurants to choose from. I have never been to this restaurant in person. I live in Austin, TX and came across this place while searching for a local place. Just thought I'd post a review after reading the 1 star review because I see this so often from Seagull reviewers. Fly in and crap on a place and fly away with no regard for the people working hard everyday trying to make a living. If a place really sucks and they have no reason serving food, then OK maybe 1 star is deserved. But based on the other reviews, I don't see that here."}
{"text":"Worse experience ever. Cook forgot my fries and offered to make them for me still. So I got them when my food was almost done and they were burnt to a crisp... I mean hard as a rock. I wasn't eating them so I complained and the cook said he would get the manager who lived close by. I said to forget it and not to bother but the cook INSISTED! Manager comes in and talks to him without coming to my seat and LEAVES. I sit awkwardly for 10 mins ignored and then leave. I have never been back. This happened 4 years ago but I'm still upset"}
{"text":"6th Street Pub N Grill looks chic and modern! A nice local crafted beer on draft and an interesting Southern influence menu. Restaurant Takeover did an awesome job in transferring this old dive pub to what it is now!  The server here is energetic and friendly.   We enjoyed our Wellington 6th Street Ale and Nicklebrook Naughty Neighbour. The menu is small but interesting. Diablos ($8) - Pepper wrapped with bacon and deep fried, crispy and porky outside but soft and spicy inside! Great drinking snack!  I definitely will be here for a drink and enjoy some southern style comfort bar food!"}
