{"text":"Wow. I'm blown away in the best way. I didn't think any place was better than La Unica as far as Mexican food around. I'm happy to say I was wrong. The food is AMAZING. Made fresh and hot. Such uniqueness. Nice servers. Quaint little place but very worth it."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better and better. They've added an additional salsa that has more of a traditional red base and it is absolutely delicious. I also tried one of their new raja tamales and it was probably the best tamale I have ever eaten. THE BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN MONROE!"}
{"text":"I left my buddies house and I needed something to eat before I head back to Davidson. This place rules! Being from California, I'm kind of a Mexican food snob, this place is awesome and I highly recommend this place. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"They have the best authentic tacos around, period! I can't even tell you how many times I've had this place. It's excellent, and cheap! The pastor and barbacoa are amazing. They are good on the authentic tacos. We are also big fans of the gorditas and sopes. My wife loves the chicken. It's not your usual mexican restaurant salsa, but it's better. This place is getting busier so come check it out. The chips are cooked fresh to order, they will come out piping hot. The torta is a great value, it's huge."}
