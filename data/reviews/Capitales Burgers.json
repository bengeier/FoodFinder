{"text":"This is the absolute best burger in Montreal.

Small diner-type place, very cool look, and nice staff. But the highlight is really the food. The most expensive item on the menu is 14$ but most of it ranges around 11$ and is well worth the price.

We've been visiting regularly and we've been consistently impressed!"}
{"text":"Great, clean place. Went there for work and stayed for lunch. 
Their burgers are absolutely gorgeous. The best I ever tried, and I tried quite a few. If you ever have a craving for the burger and a putin, don't spoil it with a large fast food chains. 
I definitely suggest trying this joint. Once again, those juicy burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"If 2 stars is \"meh. I've experienced better\" then 2 star this is. Burger was alright, but nothing too amazing, sadly (especially since its supposed to be a burger centric restaurant). The poutine wasn't to my taste and that is due to the fries, soggy yet tastes a bit burnt."}
{"text":"A cool ambience and friendly, polite staff make this a nice place to eat out.

All their signature burgers are named after a national capital, hence the name. Cool. Depending on the burger, the patties are made of either beef, chicken or pork. Sadly, there's no more salmon. One burger has a vegetarian patty (I'm guessing tofu). They each come with a different set of veggies, cheese, bacon and condiments as toppings.

Since I prefer beef burgers instead of chicken or pork, I ordered the Montreal burger (it has all of the above toppings like an all-dressed pizza) and tried their regular poutine while I was at it.

After a modest waiting time, I was presented with my meal on a black rectangular plate on a metal tray. Why the poutine was served in an aluminum pan when I wanted it to eat there instead of to go, I don't know. It would have been better served on the plate.

Tasty chewy fries in a poutine gravy with cheese curds; the way it's supposed to be. The burger was all dressed, well cooked and tasty. Not sure about the missing dill pickle another reviewer had mentioned, but otherwise yes, more mayo would have been nice."}

{"text":"Decided to try the burgers at this joint in LaSalle after my coworker kept raving about the food. So I ordered a Montreal burger and a poutine; the Montreal burger is basically a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, onions, ketchup, mustard and mayo. The burger was awesome! The meat was tasty good and had that grilled flavour I like, the toppings were nice and fresh, and the bun was just perfect. The poutine on the other hand was disgusting; lumpy sauce and the flavour was off, the fries were oily and tasted old; I picked out the cheese and the rest went to the garbage 
I would definitely go back for the burger but maybe order a different side. The venue was clean, cosy and busy; they offer delivery too."}
{"text":"Great burger, clean place and friendly staff. Menu is limited, they could use a couple more items. Avoid the sweet potato fries as they are not good at all."}
{"text":"With all the burger places that have sprung up over the last few years; ranging from places with peanut shells on the floor, to burgers that cost as much as a meal for 2 - this simple spot in a strip mall is a welcome addition to the mix. When we showed up towards dinner time no one was in the place. We were slightly concerned, but I'm glad we did stay - and here's why.

The menu is focused and fairly priced. The quality stood out with AAA beef being used for the burgers we ordered. The two different topping combinations from their list of 5 named burgers (they also serve, chicken, salmon, pork and veggie patties), surrounded by soft brioche buns (choice of ciabatta as well) with fitting condiments went very well with their skin on potato fries.

They even serve breakfast, and their hours appear pretty long for the average burger joint. We were pretty full so that wasn't our main concern. One thing I was concerned about was that my medium cooked burger was not really that warm to the bite. Thankfully, the quality beef saved the situation from going from oh no, I hope that was cooked enough, to upset stomach.

I'm looking forward to trying some of their other trios and will order my meat more well done.

A shout out to their front of house friendliness."}
