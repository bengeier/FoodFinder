{"text":"Alas, the La Stanza in Rosemere has CLOSED and the building is for lease! I'm so disappointed; it was my favorite buffet in Quebec and I'll miss the friendly people who worked there.

Unless I find that the same staff moved to a new location, I'll have to settle for my second choice, the Casa Corfu in Montreal (another fabulous buffet)."}
