{"text":"was a very lovely meal! the food was great, the presentation was nice, the prices were fair and the service was wonderful! the owners are fantastic people. perfect location if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I am truly sad that this place is closed. I have known the owners since they had sushi park on Dundas (at least 10 years). The food is wonderful and the owners are the sweetest, most polite people ever. I was always greeted with a hug. The first time I had sushi it was made by him and I have never found better sushi."}
{"text":"This is actually not a bad place.  Your typical mom and pop store.  Workers  were extremely nice and courteous.  We ordered 2 bento  boxes for lunch, each at $15.99.  A little on the expensive side.  

By looking at us, it seems like the husband knew what we ordered was just not enough.  He gave us an order for his special house rolls which consisted of salmon, tempura and avocado.

The kalbi beef was actually a bit tough but everything else was pretty good.  

Other than the price and portion size,  I don't have any issues with this place.  

Will I come back... only if I'm not that hungry.  Lol"}
{"text":"Still amazing! Had dinner here last week and it's still really delicious! I love the energy roll and the green dragon and the kamikaze roll. And the house salad remains one of my favourite things to eat of all time. Young and Hannah are the most beautiful and kind restauranteurs and people you will ever meet. Pay them a visit! You most certainly won't regret it."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat in the area and stumbled upon Odai on the urban spoon app and I am so glad we checked it out.

I had a sashimi appetizer, and a black dragon roll. My friend had a bento box. Everything was fresh and delicious. The waitress also let my friend substitute a maki roll in her bento box for one she preferred. They also gave us a vegetable pancake on the house. I've never bothered to try one before but it was delicious.

The staff is very friendly. It's a small place that is kind of hidden within the plaza with only one chef and one server but they are very attentive and constantly checked on us without being intrusive.

I would definitely go here again. The only reason I think they are not as popular as other sushi places in Mississauga is because it isn't AYCE but for the service and quality of food, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Me and my family have been going here for over 10 years. I have always loved the food here, and the service is AWESOME.  the business is owned by 3 Japanese family members. They live us, we always got free food from them, every time we went. They are one of the nicest people I have ever met. They are very welcoming. I ordered some California rolls, and some cucumber rolls and like I said, got a lot of free food.  The combos are perfect, just the right amount of sushi in each combo. It has great prices, like regular mom and pop shops. They also make everything (sauces and rice) from scratch in house. They always remember my favourites, location is in the middle of middle eastern shops, it is a little hard to get to. iT is to bad that they are closing may 29th.  I will truly miss them try to go here before they close. It sucks. Try to pick something up and experience the nice, warm hearted caring employees. It really sucks."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and was looking for sushi close by. I found this place on Yelp and tried it for the first time a couple weeks ago. The sushi was delicious, the staff super friendly and welcoming. They gave me a complimentary roll with my order and everything was fresh and delicious. I've been back since for dine in and Young, the man who served me the first time, remembered me and I was warmly welcomed. Again I was more than taken care of and enjoyed every bite. This place is a little hard to find but so worth it. I sent my boyfriend here also and he too loved it. Highly recommend to everyone, these guys should have much more business. Delicious, amazing service, fresh and very fairly priced. My new go to spot for weekly sushi."}
{"text":"Quite surprised to not find this business on Yelp.

Warm and welcoming faces greet you every time you enter and I'm quite surprised by the effort to make you feel welcome. By the third visit you're practically family and the couple which runs the place have learned your name even remember your friends and family.

Located in a plaza with unfortunate street access, this place is tucked away behind the Canadian Tire at the Heartland Town Centre. It's a small restaurant with room for roughly 30 guests.

The service if fairly quick and they never hesitate to explain the menu or to allow modifications to the ingredients. The portions are fair and presentation is great, but I must say that each time I've visited I've been given a complimentary appetizer of dessert. They really do aim to please.

This is sushi for western tastes and I have no problem with that. The menu is large and has plenty of options other than sushi. The atmosphere, the service, and the price all make this restaurant a winner."}
{"text":"the staff is very nice and very welcoming, the restaurant is very clean and i like that, the wash rooms are also neat and tidy.

i've only been here twice and ive only gotten the red dragon rolls and the green dragon rolls, the way they make it is strange compared to other places.

normally red dragon rolls are like dynamite rolls with salmon on top, however, at Odai, they just put crab meat tempura in the middle with salmon and avocado on top............................................
wheres the cucumbers and shrimp tempura ?! :( 

i asked the lady why its made differently and she looked sad and asked if im not happy with it. i felt guilty so i just said its okay, ill eat it anyways. no big deal. even though i kinda wanted it done differently. but they were so nice i couldnt say anything lol 

the bill came to $12 for myself, which i think is a little over priced for a tiny red dragon roll. however, the super friendly staff made up for it.

i aint even mad."}
{"text":"I go here often with family!  My mom especially insists on always eating at Odai Sushi, foregoing all other Sushi joints in the area because she loves the service and food  we get at Odai Sushi.  The food here is always made fresh using great quality ingredients and every now and then the owners will even send out something complimentary as a token of appreciation.  It's owned by a couple and they make sure you are greeted with a smile and check on you periodically to ensure sure you're enjoying your food.  Plan on remaining a loyal customer.  The only reason I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars and not 5 is because the food tends to be a bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"There are more concerned about making a buck than providing a good service. No flavor in the rolls."}
{"text":"Our office loves ordering from Odai! The family who runs it are very sweet and always so generous. The sushi always tastes fresh and there is never too much rice in the rolls. The spicy anything is delicious and there are many lunch specials. They are hidden in the plaza but rest assured, it's well worth the discovery!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here. We dine in and take out. We love this place because it feels like we're at someone's house. The service is amazing and the food is great. They always give us extra stuff for free. Last time we got a free roll with mango on top and it was the best roll I've had there. Everyone that dine there seem to be regulars or maybe its that they treat everyone like its their friends. I love food and been to many restaurants from low end to high end so for me to give 5 stars, it has to be a special place."}
{"text":"Service was very good, courteous waitress. However, the spicy salmon sushi was the worst I have ever had. A bit disappointed, it seems the tempura bits were leftovers since they were stale. The salmon sashimi cuts didn't look appealing either. Portions were good, but considering heart sushi is right next door, you might as well go there since a bento box here is about 15$ plus. May give it a second chance."}
{"text":"They have the best service and so many options of combo. So far the best local sushi that doesnt relate to all you can eat..."}
{"text":"Nice sushi not alot of rice , thinly sliced sashimi in sunomo salad ( like see through sashimi lol) Would come back if in the area.  gave it 3/5"}
{"text":"Very warm and inviting. Always remember my favorites. We go there mostly for lunch. The food is expertly crafted and all the sauces are made in house from scratch.  Because l'm not an expert on the different kinds of sushi, I have been letting the owner just make me whatever he wants and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. Came here close to closing time and they were happy to serve us and make our meal enjoyable. The food itself was above average, considering most other places in the area are ayce."}
{"text":"This place is owned by Korean. For an Asian place, this place has very friendly service. I'm pretty much used to non-existent service in standard Asian places. So this was a surprise. 

The food took forever because there were only 2 staff working the entire restaurant: a sushi chef and a woman who doubled as server and kitchen chef. We endured the wait. To compensate, they gave us a potato pancake and a Green Dragon roll for free. If they didn't do this, I probably would have given them 3 stars. But it just goes to show that the staff really care about you having a good experience. 

I find the prices here $1-3 higher than other places of comparable quality. We ordered bento boxes and they come with miso soup, rice,and salad. The portions were about right. In terms of quality, I've had better. There was something about the rice that didn't rub me right. But overall it was still very delicious. The rice to \"stuff\" ratio was ok.

There are tons of sushi places in the GTA so for me, it boils down to convenience and value. You can't really go wrong with Odai sushi. The extra wait we had to endure was probably a one time thing so I don't hold it against them. The food wasn't the best but it was far from the worst. At these price points, I'm not compelled to visit regularly. But if you care about service, Odai has an edge."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday with some family.  For myself, I got a bento box B7, which included some shrimp tempura, 5 pcs of sashimi, red dragon roll and rice.  It also included salad, miso soup, glass noodles and edamane.  

As you can see from the pictures, the sashimi was very fresh and tasty as was the dragon roll.  It had nice flavour to it and all the ingredients were of high quality.  I also really enjoyed the shrimp tempura as it was very crispy/crunchy but without too much batter. Excellent.  

So why the 4 stars and not 5 stars? 
a) Price.  For $17, I thought it was a bit pricey.  
b) Serving glass noodles first.  I thought this was kind of strange as it usually accompanies the bento box.

Otherwise, I thought service was really friendly and the food was of high quality.

Verdict: will go again if I'm not craving AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"CLOSING!! Eat here before they close on May 29th.

Sad to report this but Kim has let us \"lunchtime regulars\" know that she and her husband are closing the restaurant to take a break. 

SO if you LOVE this place make sure you stop by one last time before they close."}
{"text":"This is a typical mom and pop sushi joint. But it meets all the criteria that make it a good place to go. I kind of wish the prices were slightly cheaper - but I admit perhaps I'm just cheap and the price is fair and reasonable.

I've only ordered one fancy roll - a dragon roll and it was good. I've only had sushi here and it has always come out fresh and delicious. They once gave us a complimentary veggie pancake and it was pretty good. 

I'll continue to come here."}
{"text":"Japanese food from a Korean perspective.

Craving Japanese but didn't feel like driving d/t. Considering I'm walking distance from Heartland I decide to explore the area for sushi near my house.

After 30 minutes I finally made it to Odai sushi! First impression tiny, dark, and empty....:-s. Not a good thing to see an empty spot, Mind you it was empty b/c I was there in b/w the lunch and dinner hour. I've been back for lunch time and it was a full house so I'm sure dinner is just as packed. As well I knew right away that this was a Korean place b/c I understood at times what the staff were saying to each other. Thanks 2NE1 for your show and making me wanna learn Korean.

Prices are like any sushi place, $6 and up with their own specialty rolls. The rice they had is very tasty, mixed well and blended nicely with the fish. The maki rolls tasted great however there was more rice than filling. Tempura was very well done, crispy, not greasy and the tempura batter did not fall apart the moment you touched it. 

On a side note, while waiting for my food, the one waitress put me to work. She asked me to grab a couple plates and glasses on a few occasions. I didn't mind at all b/c she asked nicely, but that was a first for me.

I'll come back for another visit mainly b/c of two items that I loved.

Items to definitely get

- Charashi Donburi
- Spicy mango salad"}
{"text":"probably the last time I'm visiting this place. The rice used was inferior sushi rice compared to other sushi bars in Mississauga. rice to fish ratio which used to be more fish now has less fish. 

not coming back"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi today and found this hidden sushi restaurant.

When I first walked in I noticed that the place was small and quiet. The place was very clean and so was their washroom! 

I ordered their Spider Maki, and the boyfriend ordered the bento box with spring rolls, dynamite rolls and green dragon. 

They gave us a complimentary veggie pancake along with soup and salad. The pancake was so dang delicious and crispy! My spider maki were a big roll and tasted really good but nothing special. The bento box was also nothing special but it tasted great, no complains it just didn't blow me out of the waters. You can get any of these rolls anywhere. 

They gave fresh orange slices in the end. Great Service, very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"A small mom-pop shop with a warm and welcoming heart!!
Food is good, price is similar like most other sushi houses.
They also served a vegetable pancake as appetizer...complimentary from the house  :-)"}
{"text":"Tip:  This place is somewhat tricky to access.  If you're driving north on Mavis, make a left on Plymouth.  If you're going west on Britannia, turn left on Latimer, then access plaza from the back, off Plymouth.  Otherwise, there is direct access if you're travelling east on Britannia.

Location-wise, Odai has also cornered the market on sushi in a predominantly South-East Asian plaza, consisting of an Indian sweets place, an insurance place, an Indian jewelry store, a Hakka restaurant, an optical store (I'm assuming is runned by Asians), Silver Spoon (Pakistani place), etc.

Fish was ok quality.  Nothing too fishy or off.  However, maki rolls were a bit loosey-goosey.  They didn't fall apart, but let's just say there was space in between the ingredients.  Rolls were quite large in size, overall good value for size!  

Decent option for utility sushi in the Heartland area...especially since Hinote/Kura are BOTH closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"We just ate at Odai Sushi for the last time, they are sadly closing after today. The warm genuine owners make you feel welcome each and every time and the food is so fresh and delicious. My wife and I are sad to lose our favourite sushi spot but would be happy to support any new ventures the owners open! It's rare to find such genuinely attentive and caring business owners and they will be missed."}
{"text":"Best service you'll ever get, staff is very welcoming and friendly. Food is good and reasonably priced. It's a small and family-run restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for its location. We came up to this place after a long ride and craving for sushi! Happy to find it!
Simple place but very welcoming! 
The temakis are pretty good!"}
