{"text":"What a find! Creative and cutting edge cuisine at a great price. We've enjoyed both breakfast and dinner here.

Ricarda's is not your boring, run-of-the-mill bacon and egg place. They have some unique offerings. For breakfast, the berry muffins with the yummy jam? Wow. The fresh pressed juice  - try the strawberry-tangerine if they have it. I wondered about the side salad with tabouleh, which accompanied my breakfast croissant, but it was perfection.

Tonight was dinner. It began with bread. No butter? No worries. The red pepper spread was so tasty. The waiter informed us that the heirloom caprese salad with burrata wasn't made with burrata cheese. It was made with burette gelato. Wait. What? Gelato? It was incredible. We tried the pappardelle with duck confit and the saffron risotto with shrimp. Both were creatively presented and delicious. Unfortunately, we were too full for one of their specialty desserts. I guess we'll have to come back."}
{"text":"Passed by this restaurant many times & finally got to try this place for a weekday lunch.  Was there from 12:30pm to 2:30pm. As I had made an online reservation, my guest & I were offered a window seat.  The restaurant is quite big, however the tables in the area where we sat were set-up quite close to each other.  Luckily Ricarda's wasn't very busy that day, otherwise it may have felt somewhat cramped up.

Our waiter & the restaurant manager were both very friendly.

We ordered the Toulon Flatbread (spicy duck sausage, sliced potato, red onion, egg, rosemary, stracciatella, $14) & Rigatoni (lamb ragout, grilled black kale and broccoli, rapini spread, aged parmesan, $18). Presentations looked as good as their tastes.  Love the fried eggs on the flatbread, and the spicy kick was perfect. The rigatoni was cooked al dente and was very flavourful.

The restaurant also has a casual take-out outlet with freshly prepared sandwiches & baked goods.

Look forward to my next visit to Ricarda's!"}
{"text":"Ricarda's opened a few days ago, and it's a must go! The waiters are lovely, attentive and knowledgable. The food is great; well-prepared and good value for money. The stuffed chicken is the best, and the grilled chicken skewers were perfect."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a longer visit than usual, which means time to meet up with old friends and enjoy a meal. Ricarda's is down the street from our hotel(in the heart of the Theatre district).  We were hooked standing outside the restaurant reading the menu so naturally we had to give it a try.  So glad we did!  The atmosphere is very cool,  the wait staff knowledgeable and friendly and the menu was innovative and yet not over the top.  My friend chose one of the daily specials- a mixed green salad with tons of tiny baby scallops.  I had spaghetti al vongole with white wine and chorizo sauce that I'm still dreaming about.    I could go on and on but you really should try it for yourselves."}
{"text":"Ok , bit of a early review , in that Ive only  been here twice for salad . But that said , really love this place . Great service , reasonable prices ( especially wine and cocktails ) . And the food has been excellent . The room is bright , inviting with a perfect music level . I'm definitely wanting to try a complete meal as the menu has some really unique and innovative options for ordering your meal ."}
{"text":"Food was cold, bland, overpriced. Service was slow. Beautiful restaurant, good wine with happy hour and nice fresh bread and red pepper dip, but nothing to rave about. The seared red snapper was the best option. Lobster sliders were overcooked. Bouliabaise was rubbery."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for a while. Their large windows and the decor behind it got my attention every time I passed, and finally decided to try their dinner the other day.

Inside the restaurant is even nicer than what it looks like from outside; the tables are not too close from each other, which I really appreciate and all the other parts of the restaurant are nicely finished with high ceiling that makes the place even more spacious and impressive. 

Two of us were there, and we ordered their Lemon Saffron Linguine and Bouillabaisse. From the first bite, it was easy to tell that we made the right choice; both of them had unforgettable flavor. Only minor down side of their dishes that we tried were that it was a bit too salty, but it didn't bother us too much. As a dessert, we ordered their cheese cake to share. We weren't too hungry when we came into this restaurant, and was debating whether to try their dessert or not initially. I am glad that we changed our mind, as their beet goat cheese was very different than the cheese cake you usually get from other restaurants. You can actually taste beet and goat cheese, which makes great combination together. 

The service was very good, too. Our server was very attentive and helpful from the beginning until the end, answering all of our questions very patiently.  

I would love to try their brunch next time."}
{"text":"I went here before going a TIFF movie. Our server was lovely. The ambiance was amazing and most of the  food was tasty. My issue,however, was with the way management handled an issue. I ordered the Branzino fish entree. I read the description thoroughly. When I got the dish, I appreciated the presentation. I started to eat it and then I tasted something weird. I don't eat pork and would never have ordered a dish with pork. I spoke to the server and asked if pork was in the dish. She said oh yes - pancetta was included. The menu did not include that information.  I started to feel sick after so I had to go to the bathroom to relieve myself of the meal. Management didn't come to speak with me to apologize.  I didn't get an apology from management nor did I get my meal discounted or comped.  Even though I had already ordered a dessert, the server brought another one to me which had \"Happy Birthday\" written on it. It wasn't my birthday. I guess this was an attempt to assuage me after the pancetta disaster. I didn't eat the second dessert because I already had one... 

So - overall this is a good restaurant, however management is lacking in customer service."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and finally decided to go in to try their bakery. It was late in the evening when I went, but luckily they have a 50% off selected baked goods if you go in the evening!! They bake their breads and select pasties fresh daily with no preservatives so they try to get rid of everything at the end of the day. 

My first time, I got a danish, and my second time I got a chocolate raspberry truffle cake. Both were eaten the day they were purchased and they definitely satisfied my evening sweet tooth.  Well worth the 50% off price! They also have some unique breads included in this promotion -- potato bread, cinnamon bread, apricot bread, to name a few. They don't slice the bread there in order to keep the bread as fresh as possible after purchase. My friend got the cinnamon loaf and it was just okay. I would still come back to try some other breads and other baked goods!"}
{"text":"I live close by to Ricarda's and since it was being constructed I've always been curious to check it out. I actually came this time as I was invited to join two friends for lunch.

The menu seems to be a mix of mediterranean foods with American touches. There's great variety on the menu and the 'build your own salad' option is definitely a crowd pleaser. My friends started off with an amazing flatbread with a cracked egg or two on top, and i began with the most heavenly roasted tomato soup that had great depth and flavour. 

For my main I had a 'spider steak' which to me seemed more like a piece of filet mignon. It was great. It wasn't cooked exactly as I had ordered, but that's ok (and this is why the review was not 5 stars). My friends had the burgers and pasta with clams.

Service was exceptional. Our server Youri was both polite and very attentive. Decor is great. It's chic, it's elegant, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went last night for food and drinks with my husband and another couple. We were table #91 ....whoot!  Service was ahhhmazing, thank you Andrew. The food was prepared and presented perfectly, thank you Damian. We had the rack of lamb, Angus steak and lobster linguine. The linguine was melt in your mouth delicious with the most perfect flavour. Wine was chilled beautifully and crisp. Great good, great atmosphere and wonderful company. Thank you to all who made my Friday night one to remember"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. My pasta had a long black hair in it. I sent it back 15 minutes later with more than half of my meal on the plate when the server came to check on our food. He came back to tell me the chef said sorry.

I WAS CHARGED FULL PRICE FOR THE MEAL THAT I HAD SENT BACK AFTER JUST A FEW BITES WITH A VISIBLE HAIR. 

Thats bad service. Bad hospitality at its best. Not coming back and certainly not recommending this place to anyone.
 
Server name : Steven"}
{"text":"We got there with the twins and it turned out to be a kid friendly restaurant :) the food was original and very delicate. They brought us home made bread with 'muhamara' Not butter. The service was excellent the staff was cheerful  and so happy to see the babies. The waitress chatted with us and held the babies so that made us feel so welcomed. We sat on the outside terrace which was nice and quiet. My only regret is that I'm visiting Toronto; won't be able to go there more often!"}
{"text":"Loved the Campagna pasta that Robert (our server) recommended and the greeter was so welcoming! We will be back."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed space- anything with black, gold and marble accents you've got my attention. 

Popped in to take a look grabbed dessert to go.

Probably the best cannoli I've tried in the city to date! Crispy outer shell with a velvety smooth ricotta filling and the ends rimmed with chocolate pistachio combo. Delish! 

Service was fast and attentive. Menu specializes in Mediterranean offerings. Will have to come back for a sit down lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant, the place is amazing and the service is great, but the food could be better, it was mediocre at best, very bland, they need a new chef."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, service and food quality ok. We walked in on a quiet Sunday afternoon so this place was deserted...maybe food and service is better when busier."}
{"text":"Excellent from all sides. Great service, wonderful atmosphere and food without fault."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but as a matter of principle, I felt I needed to write this one. 

I work across the road from Ricarda's and I was excited to see that they had a \"build your own salad\" option on their menu. I went in today to order a salad to go. At the last minute, I decided to add chicken to my salad for an extra $5.95 which I thought was a little steep but proceeded with because I was quite hungry. When my salad came out I was shocked to see three TINY, thin slices of chicken on it. I was blown away and said to the waitress...\"this is an awfully small portion of chicken for $6\" and she just nodded apologetically. She offered to ask the chef to add more and normally I wouldn't have said ok but the salad was almost $19 and I was pretty appalled. I saw her walk over to the chef and say something to him, she then grimaced as he said something back to her before storming off with my bowl. She came back a minute later and said \"I hope this is OK\", I looked down to see he'd added HALF of one more tiny slice of chicken. I shook my head, took the salad and walked out. 

I get it Ricarda's, you're fancy and appeal to a certain demographic, but that's no excuse to blatantly rip people off. There are many options in the area, especially when it comes to salad. I'll be spreading the word."}
{"text":"I'm still coming off cloud nine as my husband and I spent over two glorious hours here for Ricarda's Mother's Day brunch. I'm so thankful they were able to squeeze us in as I inquired the day before since we were going to be in the area.

The service, from the hostess seating us, to our server -- and everyone commandeering their buffet stations-- was spectacular. The ambiance is quaint with rustic and inviting modern vibes.

This buffet -- that was split by cuisine  across countertops-- was better than yummy. I loaded up on salad assortment after salad assortment (yes, I am the one who likely used up all the white balsamic dressing) that was simple yet so delicious with all the toppings. There was steak,  salmon, a breakfast area, oysters for the bougie, antipasto, and a dessert area with the most delicious treats -- including personalized créme brulee and a fudge type concoction in an edible chocolate cup.

Everything hit the spot and was so perfect, including the live jazz and kids club option that allowed me and my husband to enjoy adult beverages and adult conversation without  our rugrats interrupting. 

I'm so thankful we got to  experience the brunch and wish we lived nearby!"}
{"text":"Came to a party at the Queen Richardson Centre where the food was catered by Ricardas. The party we attended had about a dozen different food stations all supplied by them. I tried more food than I can even remember but some of the highlights included a prime rib sandwich station (with sautéed onions in au jus), their flat bread pizza station, and the smoked egg plant ravioli station. At the end of the night they even brought out a \"make your own smores\" station as well.

Everything here was top quality and top class. I'd be interested to get a look at their actual menu, but if the food we had at the party was any indicator I bet it's great."}
{"text":"Excellent service during our visit. Greeted with a smile by all staff. The menu has a diverse and delicious spread and excellent flavors. The flatbreads were quite tasty and unique!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to visiting Ricarda's since they had opened. But, a co-worker had eaten there a few weeks back and he was not impressed by his meal. This made me lower my expectations so when I had a lunch with some friends I was pleasantly surprised.
It's pretty obvious that the space is beautifully designed. There is a separate To Go area where you can grab lunch, breads or desserts. They all looked really good from the outside and I will come back to try their offerings. My friends and I sat at the dining area for our meal. The service was polite and quick, but they seem to keep dropping things. Quirky feature was the sandwich board they place at the side of each table to display the specials of the day. There were a lot of choices in the specials as well as the menu. It was nice to see that you can customize salads and flat breads but this seemed to be really extensive.
My friends decided to get their custom salads and I opted for one of the specials, Shrimp and Octopus with Harissa ($18). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It had a good amount of spice and there was an abundance of large shrimp and diced octopus with pearl couscous. I would definitely come back for this meal.

Overall, Ricarda's is a nice addition to the area. It's a 3.5 stars for me but I'm bumping to 4."}
{"text":"the seafood are really fresh and service is good too and I can make sure to return for eat it again in the near future"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Jazz Brunch.
Lots of selection on food choices:
shrimp cocktails
Raw oysters
Pasta bar
Foie gras & omlette
Waffles/ crepes
and many other options !!

My favorite part of my meal must be the foie gras & omlette !!

Brunch is $55 per person (includes drip coffees)
Service is excellent, Ambience is nice - they have musicians playing instruments live !!!

Overall, would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior.  Service was great!  Food was even better.  I ordered the cinnamon French toast and it was absolutely delicious. My hubby ordered the smoked salmon crepe. A good combo of sweet and savoury.  We also ordered a dresset- it was alright- not my fave type of dessert, but pretty to look at.  You must try their freshly squeezed juices/drinks. We had watermelon/blueberry and raspberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced for what you get. We ended up spending $165 for a brunch. The food was very good though, but the service was poor."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed brunch at Ricarda's! I'm from nyc so I feel like I know brunch (nyc is the capital
Of brunch!) and this place definitely scored high on my brunch scale. No bottomless but that's cool because their mimosas are made with freshly squeezed oj and their brunch menu is really good. I had their spinach quinoa burger and my husband had the lamb burger. Both super tasty! Our waitress Hillary was super sweet! Every Sunday they have a live jazz brunch. I would definitely go back next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Ricarda's is a great dinner option. Something in between fancy and casual. 

The decor is lovely. They have a separate lounge area + just dinner table area.
On Sundays they have Jazz brunch - which is $55/person for a buffet and no a la carte option. So if you're aiming here for brunch and don't want to do the buffet, probably best to come on a Saturday instead. 

The staff are all quiet on point. The food came out fairly quick as well. Lots of interesting plates to pick from!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern environment. I came here for lunch and ordered the soup of the day, the lobster linguine, and the creme brulee. The food was presented very nicely and was quite good, but it took a long time for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"The lamb burger was fantastic. Service was excellent. Terri had the vegan burger and really enjoyed it. We'll be back for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Easily a top restaurant in Toronto. After a warm welcome, we were seated a table near the open kitchen. It was a treat to watch the action. The food was exceptional - mushroom risotto, ravioli, and lamb shank. Let's not forget the desserts! We shared blue moon cheesecake and pavlova. Ricarda's is a hidden gem. Thank you for the extraordinary food, and impeccable service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While rushing back to the office from a big time Hollywood event today I stopped int at Ricarda's to grab a sandoozle.

**Full Disclosure: I stopped in to the cafe portion of Ricarda's. I did not sit down and have a full meal though I will update if I go back**

The menu is small and to tell you the truth I remember none of it other than what I got. What I got was the \"Roasted Chicken Sandwich\". However, I don't know why they called it a roasted chicken sandwich when they should have called it a chicken salad sandwich because A) That's what it is and B) Everyone loves chicken salad, it's the best salad.

So back to my sandy.

The sandwich comes on a delicious, possible freshly baked in house, crusty bun. A crusty bun which absolutely tore apart a vicious cut on the inside of my lip. I got said cut when I bit my lip on two separate occasions during a different, possibly tastier, meal earlier this week. This absolutely ruined my experience and is the only thing I can remember about the sandwich (with the exception of all I wrote above).

Is it fair that I based this entire review off my inability to eat? No. 

But you know what? I don't think it's particularly fair that as a grown ass man I was never taught how to chew properly. 

Tit for Tat Ricarda's!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely - 1930s glam inspired with white marble and gold accents  Reminds me of Pasadena.   

My team and I went here for lunch.  We each ordered a sandwich and a pastry.  I got the pulled chicken sandwich and it left much to be desired.  I asked the kitchen for some aioli to add to my very dry sandwich.  They said that they had run out of aioli and offered me mayo.  For a $8-$10 price tag per sandwich,  diners should not be required to additionally season in any way or use Hellman's. Although the manager was apologetic, no additional measures were taken to make our experience more enjoyable.   

We also watched a chef struggle to make a medium rare burger.  We watched it get overcooked twice, wherein it was devoid of all juice.

I may return here for the ambiance with clients, but there are many neighboring venues that have great food AND great service.  Their competition is fierce.  I hope Ricarda's improves its CRM.  It really is a beautiful venue."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!

Likes:
- Service was efficient and pleasant, and our waitress was very knowledgeable about the dishes.
- Food was delicious. The chefs were thoughtful and deliberate with small touches that elevated each dish.
- Lovely open concept kitchen with high ceilings in the dining room.

Not as impressed:
- Can't really think of any

I came here with 2 of my girlfriends and we all enjoyed this dinner. We ordered the following dishes:

Char-Grilled Octopus ($19) - The octopus tentacles were tender and I enjoyed the Mediterranean influence in the dish. I love both black olives and plum tomatoes, so it was a perfect combination for me. The fresh piquiollo gremolata was bright and had a mild sweetness to it. The israeli couscous was fried and added a nice crispy element to the dish.

Carnaroli Risotto ($22) - The presentation of this dish was not particularly appetizing, but the whiff of truffle oil immediately caught my attention. The risotto was rich, creamy and just delicious! The parsley and hibuscus sea salt added brightness to this otherwise heavy dish. And the unexpected hint of floral flavour somehow worked. This was definitely one of my favourites for the night.

Milano Flatbreads ($17) - The melted cheese and artichokes were my favourite toppings. I also liked the earthy mushrooms which of course paired perfectly with truffle oil. Overall, I enjoyed the flatbread, although this isn't a must order in my view since there were so many other delicious choices.

Aged Balsamic Glazed Brome Lake Duck Breast ($27) - The risotto had some stiff competition as I couldn't quite decide which dish I enjoyed more. The duck breast was rich and flavourful and the parsnip puree and figs added a nice sweetness to the dish. The creamer potatoes and mushrooms complimented the dish well and we almost licked the plate clean!

Ricarda's Signature Tiramisu ($10) - The tiramisu was a nice finish, although I was more impressed with the savoury dishes here. The tiramisu was wrapped in a thin piece of dark chocolate, which although tasty, I prefer the traditional version a lot more. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and I have every intention to return!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favourite resteraunt, period. The food is absoloutley fantastic, and quite honestly a meal you will never forget. Everything from the menu is simply Devine and the environment is business casual. I simply can't go a single visit to Toronto and not stop in at this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After walking for hours around the city we settled into this lovely restaurant for dinner.  No, we didn't have a reservation, but fortunately got a table instantly.  And it was a pretty busy Saturday night.  I guess they recognized our famousness ;)
But seriously, the service was impeccable.  The food was virtually perfectly prepared, and the drinks were made just right, with a nice wine list was well.  I also would highly recommend the Brioche bread pudding for dessert, amazing.  We got lucky finding this place after looking at many menus and other restaurants along the way."}
{"text":"I saw this place at Richmond St a few times and decided to try it out! The restaurant is owned by a French Couple and was relaunched in January this year! The decor designed is fantastic and you can see the effort taken to maintain good quality of food and service.

We tried the Southern French Vegetable Soup, which was very nicely cooked. I could never imagine pesto sauce and pine nuts in a soup but the chef did a great job.

While the Vegetarian Burger was very messy to eat, it was worth the effort! It was stuffed with corn patty and came with in house sauce. It also came with hand cut fries, which were not cooked properly...

I tried almond cake for desserts. It was good for the first time but probably too sweet for my platter."}
{"text":"Me and 20 of my coworkers went to Ricarda's for lunch and we made reservations and selected all meals one day in advance and yet it took one hour after we had arrived until the meals were served. 

I had the flat bread called \"Milano\" (mushrroms and some vegetables) which is basically a slightly oval shaped pizza and I was honestly not impressed. I personally think a decent frozen pizza from Loblaws could easily compete with the pizza/flat bread they served at Ricarda's and the pizza at loblaws would have been roughly 10$ cheaper.
I couldn't really taste much flavour even though the waitress added some pepper afterwards. It had nothing memorable. 

One of my coworkers had visitted this place before and had beef carpaccio. She said it tasted like old socks and she didn't understand how a chef could screw up this kind of dish. 
When we went for lunch she had tomato sauce and said it tasted like canned tomato sauce. There was no garnish no nothing and that for $11 without tax.

With tax I paid almost $20 for my pizza thing and could have had a much more delicious and bigger pizza for less $ at one of my favourite pizza places (not a chain).

The environment at Ricarda's was very noisy as the place was very busy but we had to yell at each other to have a conversation but I realized that this is fairly common in Toronto.

It was my first and last time there. At this price range there are better places in downtown.

Not impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few months ago and was impressed so decided to try the jazz brunch HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 

When I made the reservation the hostess said there were 11am and 130pm seatings and could only accomdate us at 130pm. We arrived at 1:35 and our table wasn't ready, no one offered to take our coats and we were left at the entrance wondering what was going on. By 145 the jazz had stopped and we made our way to the buffet ( after being told they don't have decaf and milk for the coffee was brought in a paper dixie cup ). The food all looked like it had been sitting out since 11 , things were either cold or crusted over. There was a tonne of staff milling about but none seemed concerned with stations running out of food / the lack fresh plates. The cook at omelette / foie gras station was unfriendly and unwilling to explain what he was serving or the ordering process ( you place your order with him, he gives you a number and then it's brought to your table - however the numbers are too small for the wait staff to see so by the time you get it , it's made a few rounds of the dining room and the same gross tepid temperature as the rest of the \"hot buffet\"   )

Around 2 I asked if the live jazz would start up again and was told they were taking a break - the break lasted till 245 , they played 15 minutes and packed up at 3. 

The restaurant was by no means full but as tables cleared out they wernt bussed so we are surrounded by dirty tables. ( Plates were also not cleared very quickly and cutlery wernt refreshed / napkins wernt refolded as one would expect at a high end brunch ) 

After we had paid our waitress asked how everything was and it was hard to hide our disappointment. She asked us to wait and went to talk to the manager. Over 10 minutes later the manager showed up with gift cards and pastries for each of us , but did not ask for any feedback - a nice gesture but too little , too late."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to trying this place since it opened this summer-- and finally got the chance to try it this past Sunday. Overall, I was very happy with my experience! Being a brunch food fanatic, I decided to check out their new Jazz Bruch offering. From French toast, to beautiful seafood and charcuterie selections, you will definitely leave feeling satisfied.
 
I also fell in love with the vast cocktail selection-- I personally tried the peach Bellini and the Pineapple Espresso Martini. Both clearly included top-of-the-line fresh ingredients, and were beautifully balanced. I sipped my drinks and indulged to the sounds of the seriously talented Jazz band. Talk about a great way to finish off the weekend.
 
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent service, nice environment, sub par food. We all ordered something different and none of us enjoyed our meal. The bouilliabase was described by the server as traditional and it was very far from that. It arrived deconstructed, ok, interesting but the broth was creamy, ugly colour, unappealing both visually and taste wise. The muscles were cold and over done. The lamb shank was boring and also with little taste . The duck ragu pappardelle - pasta nicely done, ragu chewy and also with little taste. This is a ho hum restaurant from a gastronomical perspective. All young kids in the kitchen and serving - some training is needed. There are so many fabulous restaurants in Toronto, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Ricarda's for the first time today.  The restaurant was fairly quiet, so we expected service to be good.  However, it wasn't the case.  First of all, my husband ordered a flat white with non-dairy milk.  Rather than asking him what his preference was, the server automatically gave him soy, citing that he wasn't sure if my husband would be allergic to almond (ummm, people can have soy allergies too).  Mistake number one.  Mistake two was in two parts.  First, they brought our orders to the wrong table, and then, it turned out my husband's order was incorrect.  Rather than eggs Benedict with a side of fruit salad, they gave him Ricarda's Classic Breakfast (eggs, chorizo and chickpea-saffron stew) with poached eggs.  My order, however, was correct - Ricarda's Classic with scrambled eggs, no chorizo (and chickpeas subbed with green beans because the chickpea stew also has chorizo).  Our sides came a little late as well.  And another issue regarding timing - we ordered another round of flat white, but the coffees took FOREVER to come.  There were machine issues, apparently, but the server should have notified us earlier rather than make us wait some 20 minutes.  Honestly, I would have given Ricarda's fewer stars had the food not been good."}
{"text":"Shopping on queen west and stopped by for a quick dinner bite. Decor is nice. Surprisingly not busy or filled dining area for a saturday night dt. Presentation of food was really nice. The food itself was mediocre - nothing special. Very reasonable price point. Would come back to try their pastries/dessert!"}
{"text":"We had a great time today at their Jazzy Brunch!
We enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service. 
I highly recommend this place and don't understand how I haven't discovered this gem earlier.

One downside - the first people of our party arrived 5 minutes before Ricarda's opened and weren't allowed in."}
{"text":"4.5/5 for my experience planning a major event and for bakery food!

After getting feedback from past formal events, one organizer recommended that we look into Ricarda's. The people my team worked with were experienced and made our jobs a lot easier. One of the biggest concern was quantity of food. The event planning team at Ricarda's gave us plenty of (quality) food. We had stations serving pasta, mediterranean food, antipasti, and of course, a dessert station. It was also for a very reasonable price, in comparison to hosting events at Oliver and Bonacini spaces.

Venue - Ricarda's is situated inside a larger building with security. We gained access to the \"upper deck\", which consisted of several couches and a perfect place for people to stay when they want to step away from the heart of the dance floor/party. Overall, very spacious and accessible by transit. 

Food - The food I at at my event was spectacular. During one of my pre-event visits, I picked up a lemon raspberry croissant. The lemon filling was oozing out of the flakey, buttery pastry. I love how the pastry had pink highlights, differentiating it from other croissants. 

I would definitely come back to try their sit down menu and of course, host another event here."}
{"text":"New discovery and a very pleasant discovery. Landed at Billy Bishop, checked at our hotel and looked at open places in Toronto at 2:30 on a Sunday. Closest and best reviewed was \"Ricarda's\". What a surprise! Got there at 2:45, brunch buffet closes at 3:00pm. No matter! They kept buffet open 20 extra minutes. What a great selection in the buffet! From the simplest to the most sophisticated you will be satisfied. The staff is friendly, corteous and helpful. Great experience overall. I seldom give 5 stars but this is a great concept executed perfectly. Dont let your guard down and keep innovating. It is well worth it. Visitng Ricarda's is a must if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing brunch atmosphere. I ordered the delicious French toast and my wife had the eggs Benedict. I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"They've done everything right here. Such a beautiful ambiance and perfect for a midday work lunch or classy dinner. Nothing's too uptight but the food and service is held to an impressive standard. I was brought the wrong dish, a seafood pasta instead of saffron shrimp risotto, and they brought the correct dish in only a few minutes with much apology. I would have enjoyed either! I'd recommend Ricarda's to anyone looking for spot on Italian/Mediterranean dishes in a classy modern space."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner at Ricarda's last night with 3 coworkers.  We started with a lovely bottle of Pinot Grigio and then shared the spicy duck sausage flatbread with potatoes and 2 eggs and the grilled octopus.  For my entree, I enjoyed the yogurt mustard cornish hens with a side salad and green beans.  

Lively atmosphere with nice live music, but the service was extremely slow considering the restaurant was packed - however, our server was professional and engaging."}
{"text":"Open airy atmosphere with nice decor with interesting green plant wall behind the hostess station.  In terms of the food, the description and visual presentation was much better than the taste.  Somehow honey truffle veal carpaccio sounded better than it was.  The Bouillabaisse did not have much fish and was too rich. Service was quite good."}
{"text":"While the decor is amazing and our service was good, the food was really sub-par. The charcuterie board was an enormous amount of salted meats with only a small dollop of mustard and the provided bread gratis to every table as an accompaniment. Usually, there is an assortment of pickled veggies, another type of mustard, a chutney/jam or crostini. I've never seen a charcuterie board that consisted of entirely just a huge amount of meat. My main was the pumpkin risotto which was served on a very flat plate which meant my serving consisted of a thin layer spread across the plate -  absolutely not worth $34. Both the parmesan and the truffle had a strange rubber-y consistency and I was extremely underwhelmed. I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant but I can't say I will be returning for another meal or recommending Ricarda's to friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks and apps. 

They need to do a better job training their staff and being clearer when they advertise their drink specials/happy hour.  We found the server cold and she mid communicated the drink specials. 25% off instead of 50% we thought it was. It got resolved professionally by the manager but took awhile. We specifically asked our server what were the specials and she said 50 % off! So what were we to think. 

The app was over salted. Drinks were strong but I wouldn't pay 15 to 20 each for them. 

Feels weird spending so much money while through the glass you are looking at homeless people at the shelter who can't afford anything here.  If I come back it's only with one of them as my guest:)"}
{"text":"Made reservations for my friends and I for dinner, and mentioned that it was a celebratory dinner for our newly engaged friends. They were kind enough to decorate our table in red rose petals which made the experience extra special for them! The food was really delicious, I shared a Caprese salad which was extra flavorful and one of the best I've had, along with crostini bites (burrata, crab & shrimp). I ordered the grilled octopus salad for my entree - it was really tasty and the squid ink was a delicious touch (was looking to eat on the lighter side).
 The ambiance is really beautiful, white marble tables, large windows and candles. 

Our server was really friendly and constantly checking in on us. 

I definitely want to try it out for Brunch :)"}
{"text":"What a gorgeous space. I came here for dinner on a Friday night for a date. There was a live pianist and jazz singer, who did an amazing job. I love the ambience of the space. High ceilings, open kitchen, lots of seatings. Definitely a place I would like to come back to. 
Our server was super friendly and made some great recommendations. We started off with a octopus salad which we a greater starter piece. It was light with the right amount of acidity and flavour. The octopus was sliced very thinly so it very easy fish to share. I ordered the duck for my main. It's cooked to your liking. I had mine medium and it was perfect for me. My date ordered a lamb shank... it is definitely a big meal. We ordered a bottle suggested by the sommelier, who I have to say did a fantastic job! He picked a wine that was within our price range that was suiting for the dishes we ordered. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure why previously this place got so much hate, but my partner and I came here in the fall and we both loved the food, venue, and service.

Food-
The cuisine here is Mediterranean/Italian - think pastas, flatbreads, fresh seafood, duck, quail, olives, capers, figs, etc. Healthy and vegetarian options are available, i.e. zucchini noodles to start, veggie burger main, lots of plant-based menu options in addition to fresh meats and many seafood dishes yayyy. The mains are not drenched in grease and you can really appreciate the wholesomeness and freshness of the ingredients. I ordered the salmon lunch main (large piece of salmon on a slab of grains with greens), which looked small, but was actually quite hearty thanks to the amount of protein. 
For dinner they have even more menu options and a small sharing menu.
The dessert menu here also sounded soooo good (tiramisu, chocolate ricotta tart, etc), but we were trying to cut back so didn't order.

Value-
$$$, definitely a fancier dining option, not for everyday.

Venue- 
Located in downtown core, very convenient for lunch during weekdays (if you can afford it lol) or fancier sit-down dinner. BIG inside! So much seating available and when we showed up for lunch we were one of very few customer groups present. The interior design is simple, clean, and classy. Bar seating is also available. 

Service-
Pretty sure we were greeted by the manager himself that day. Friendly staff, not intrusive."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Mother's Day lunch and was really impressed. The food is very reasonably priced, good sized portions and tastes delicious. For the starter I had the crab bisque which had chunks of real crab meat and for my main I ordered the seafood risotto which was creamy and had three huge shrimp! My dad got the lamb burger which was cooked to perfection and my mom ordered the lobster linguine which had lovely hand made noodles. For dessert we had the tiramisu which was wrapped in a perfect dark chocolate shell. 
The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and spacious and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write this review.  There was obviously a lot of thought, care and energy put into creating this restaurant.  

The space is beautiful - probably one of the most amazing restaurants I've ever seen, in terms of design and decor.  That's probably the best thing about this place, unfortunately.  I don't know that I quite understand the concept.  There is a lot of 'make your own' type of menu items, and I like the idea, but it almost feels like the menu is so expansive, you lose sight of what the house specialties are.  Obviously, they do offer their own curated flatbreads and pastas, etc., but they didn't really have significant appeal.  Some of the combos were just weird.  

I visited with two of my friends and we were able to sample quite a few dishes.  

- Halloumi with fig and olives - it was only OK.  I recently reviewed a restaurants where I had eaten the most incredible halloumi salad, and that perhaps ruined this one for me (b/c Ricarda's was not nearly as impressive).

- Radicchio + cabbage salad - very tasty.  Was missing texture (needed something crunchy).  At the end of the day, it's a relatively simple salad though.  

- Octopus - I didn't eat this but my companions did.  The plate was beautiful, but the flavour was just OK.

- Chicken Shish with polenta and zucchini spaghetti.  Again, another beautiful plate but the flavour was just OK.  This had so much potential but it fell flat.

- Spinach pasta with duck and a sauce of garlic, anchovy, olive.  The pasta was overcooked and the duck was lacking in flavour.

- Corn pasta with a red sauce w/ mushroom and artichoke.  The pasta was good, firm.  The sauce was way too acidic/sour.  I was surprised by this, b/c balancing a red sauce is pretty basic.

- Pistachio cake....which tasted like lemon and nothing like pistachio.  I love lemon, so that's OK.  The dessert was fine.  Unmemorable.  

One note about everything we ordered:  PRETTY.  So pretty.  Everything lacked flavour, which I know I keep saying, but that was the overall theme here.  It was exciting to select from the many options on the menu and the plates were wow in appearance, but the food is nothing special.  

The service was friendly and welcoming.  There was one weird moment: At one point, in the middle of eating out appetizers, a runner came over and asked if we wanted our mains now or in a few minutes.  Terrible.  This should not happen.  The place was not busy -- should be able to time things better.  This is prob why the pasta was overcooked (it had likely been sitting).

I wouldn't go back here unless for drinks, simply to enjoy the beautiful space."}
{"text":"Richard's is situated on Peter Street near Queen and Spadina with modern high ceilings and stylish decor. It's welcoming and the staff are friendly and professional. The food comes out relatively quickly for a table of 4 at 12PM on a Saturday. We also got complimentary pastries before our meal and the cappuccino, tiramisu and creme brûlée (although the sugar was a little too thick for our personal taste) was good. Not great, but good. 

I'm giving it a 3 star because the food wasn't out of this world amazing, it was average. Also, my Lamb Confit with Hash.. while a little under seasoned, it was good. But the flavours weren't something I'd crave from time to time. Also it gave me an upset stomach that I get when I ingest too much MSG. It was definitely a disappointment. I went for brunch but maybe the dinner menu might be better."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my radar for a while and I finally got the chance to try it during the SUmmerlicious event! I ordered the quinoa salad with almonds,mint lemon vinaigrette and  orange segments, the vegetarian risotto, the dark chocolate croquant, and finally, the  cheesecake lemon crumble. 

First, we got tiny slides of bread served cold, with some kind of tomato garlic spread. The restaurant also served a Mediterranean gazpacho with olive oil, crispy basil. I would NOT recommend it at all! It's basically Clamato juice with a couple basil leaves, served cold in a cocktail glass. My friend ordered that as an appetizer (as did a lot of people in the dining room) and couldn't even take more than a few sips.

The quinoa salad was great, perfect for the summer heat. The vegetarian risotto is very heart, but the waiter did warn me that it would be missing some of the veggies because the restaurant didn't receive their order that morning... 

The dessert was good too. I didn't like that mint creme (or mousse?) on the dark chocolate croquant. It was served with a mango salsa on the side, which was kind of random. The cheesecake crumble was just dusts of graham crackers, not the kind of baked crumble that you see on a pie."}
{"text":"First time at this place and the decor look 'aight so went in for a drink while I waited to meet a friend. They were on happy hour so had half priced house wine is always good. And to be fair the wine was pretty good. 

My beef comes with the price of the tapas. Crazy expense, actually nutty. Portions we hilariously small. Like thought it was a mistake at first. Would only recommend for a drink or two. I think they are new as it all felt a little disorganized but you know what, Im sure it will get better over time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past few months for team lunches, it's one of my favourite spots in the area. The interior is beautifully designed with lots of light. There is a separate bakery area that sells baked goods, salads, and sandwiches for those who are on the go. 

Note: I've only come for the lunch service and have yet to come for dinner. From experience I've had very friendly servers. They're able to accommodate and serve large groups. They serve different daily specials so be sure to check them out! 

The food has always been great, I haven't been let down yet. The table bread is very delicious and it comes with what seems like a tomato based spread. If you're really hungry you could ask for refills. My favourite appetizer is the halloumi (cheese that has been lightly grilled). Sous vide salmon is really lovely, the salmon isn't overcooked and the skin is light and crispy. The octopus in that dish was also done really nicely. The only thing I will say is the risotto was a bit too watery for my liking but the flavours were good. I've had another salmon special and it seems like they're very consistent in how they cook their fish. 

I've gotten the power blend salad from the bakery and the staff was very nice when I asked if i could add protein to it. They really went out of their way to make it for me even though I was just inquiring about it. It's a great place with great food!"}
{"text":"Summerlicious  2017 has started! Since this restaurant is close to home, we decided to try their Summerlicious menu.

The restaurant is spacious and has a contemporary look. We were greeted by an Asian host by the name of Vance. She took us to our seats but since we didn't really like where we're being seated, we kindly asked her if we can go to the window table for 2. Her reply was that it was reserved. And so I told her we also made a reservation to which she replied \"It was reserved for a group\". Mind you,  we were there at 11:30 am so the restaurant is not full yet so not sure why she didn't agreed to our simple request. 
WTF, we've dine in a lot of Toronto restaurants (from the high end to the low end) and this is the first time a request for another table wasn't granted to us on an empty restaurant!

Even though we had this \"not so good experience\", we tried to forget about it and give the restaurant another chance. 

The food was good although portions are smaller  compared to  other 'licious restaurants we've been to.  

But what's up with the people who work in this restaurant? Our server wasn't even smiling and uncommunicative. Even the people who brings your food lacks the enthusiasm and energy you normally see from people who work in the food hospitality industry. 

With so many competing restaurants around the area and restaurants closing, Ricarda's should really take into consideration how to provide good customer service. Cause one thing is for sure, you're losing repeat clients  by the way how your employees treat the paying customers!"}
{"text":"Winterlicious lunch was very average and Portions were small, I ordered Pan Seared Chermula Sea Bream which is pretty average. The mango chocolate tart is very sweet, Apple Ginger Sour Cream Cake was just apple pieces and bread nothing special.
 For appetizers Grilled Black Kale & Romaine Salad was interesting tasted okay, portion was small, my friends Sourdough Tartine was not good either. 
Service is really good. 
Below I attached photoshopped photos"}
{"text":"After being seated around 12:05 for a $55 brunch buffet, our greeter returned to say, \"we have a 1:30 reservation so we'd really appreciate it if you left by 1:15\". That, and milk for our coffee being brought to the table in a to-go cup, made for a less than stellar experience. That said, our server was terrific and the coffee was great. Food ranged from above average to excellent. 
Previously, I'd been for dinner and had great food and laughably poor service. 
If their management changed, I dare say it would be worth a third try. But I'd have no way to know."}
{"text":"Loved the desserts.  I am diabetic and it wasn't too sweet.  It was spectacular. And I even bought another to share at home."}
{"text":"I made a reservation to come here for my friend's baby shower brunch.  I actually called to make the reservation, and was told that the person that organizes the Sunday Jazz brunch wasn't in but she would call me in a couple of days.  I never got a phone call so I made a reservation on Open Table just to be safe.  Shortly after I got a call advising I had to leave a credit card for the reservation.  I told her that I had called previously, so there wouldn't be duplicate reservations...turns out the reservation was never made when I called, nor was the person that organizes the brunch told.  So good thing I went on Open Table.

The restaurant is beautiful.  Unfortunately we were seated in the atrium, which meant that it was essentially \"regular\" brunch b/c the jazz band was in the restaurant, and there were no speakers in the atrium.  It was disappointed that we paid a premium for a \"jazz brunch\" but only got half of the deal.  While the food was alright, it was way overpriced IMO.  I've been to other Sunday jazz brunches for the same, or lower prices, and you get either unlimited or even a couple of drinks included.  Not here. 

They have a pasta station where you place your order and they give you a buzzer when it's ready.  I ordered the special.  It took FOREVER.  The pasta was essentially my dessert.  And the portion was SO tiny.  I know I could go back and get more, but didn't really feel like waiting again.  

I was really looking forward to checking this place out.  It was okay, but I've been to better Sunday brunches and I think I'll stick with those."}
{"text":"please read this review before going! 

I decided to finally check out Ricarda's with a friend for lunch. We walked in (great location), and didn't need reservations. 

The reason this spot gets 5 stars is because of the friendliness of the staff, location, atmosphere and decor. I fell in love. We sat at a high table with leather chairs and just behind us was a cute half moon shape booth. 

If I was to base my review solely on the food, it would have been 4 stars. I ordered the Lobster Pasta and my friend ordered the salad (who does that?) the pasta was cooked perfectly, the lobster however was way too chewy and the sauce had no flavour... thank god for salt. 

My drink was really good though but how can you mess up a rhy and ginger. I've made reservations for drinks next week. It is the perfect spot for drinks and I hope to check out the dinner menu as well. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Came here for jazz brunch. The restaurant was busy and it was fully booked. The food tasted great but not many selections, at least less than many other brunch buffet. I like the pan seared foie gras and the freshly made egg benny. The sweets were the best part! The live jazz band was a great addition to the brunch experience."}
{"text":"We came to Ricarda's in a party of 4 for dinner on an early Saturday night. It was fairly easy to get reservations, and got busier towards 8pm. 

We ordered: 
- black and yellow fettuccine
- marinated salmon 
- grilled octopus
- toula flatbread with spicy sausage and 2 sunny side up eggs 
- pork belly 
- yogurt cornish hen with a side salad of spring mix, dried figs, and dried apricots and a ratatouille. 

Highlights were the flatbread, cornish hen, and pork belly. The flavours and execution worked together very well - I love apple and pork, and the apple and bacon bits on the pork belly were delicious. The cornish hen was very moist, but the salad seemed to be an afterthought of greens thrown on the plate. The ratatouille was tasty, but slightly underwhelming- it was similar to chopped vegetables in a curry base. The bread was also a bit underwhelming for a place that makes their own bread (they have a bakery attached to the main restaurant for quick grab and go goods). 

Dessert was the rum baba, a cake with a flambé banana, rum ice cream, and rum soaked raisins. The cake was a bit of a bread like consistency, but the rum flavours were very strong. 

Overall it worked out to be roughly $160 without drinks, which was pretty reasonable! Overall, the flavours and execution was well done, but the dishes could be more interesting and creative. 

Would definitely come again to try their brunch and other menu items."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place because it's in my neighborhood and I always see the fresh bakery! 

My friend and I finally decided to try it out. I ordered the blueberry Danish from the bakery shop, and the crispy Duck salad, I LOVE both of them! The duck salad has dried cranberries and mandarins in it which makes this dish very refreshing and unique!  

However, my friend ordered the homemade pasta and almond croissant, she didn't like the paste because the noddles were very soft and overall it was too salty. 

I will definitely go back and check out more items on their menu."}
{"text":"4 stars for environment, 3 stars for food. Highly recommend this place for a special occasion/large groups - very spacious & comfortable, natural sunlight, quiet enough for conversation, elegant but not pretentious. 

Came for dinner. Ordered the mushroom flatbread, veal carpaccio and the walnut salad to share. Complimentary bread with dip (red eggplant hummus??) was good. We shared a bottle of Riesling which was good. 

The Saffron Ravioli was good with a distinct saffron flavour and butternut squash filling, however the scallops on top were way too salty. The bouillbaisse was lukewarm and the cornish hen was slightly overcooked. It also took a while for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Here now, and the food and service is mediocre!   We had to ask for a second glass of twice, and our food sat on the table waiting.   Bad food, over priced and not enough staff.   Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ricarda's is a classy establishment for a girl's night out, a dressy date or a business meeting. (I think they film Suits here sometimes?) The decor is tastefully curated, in a non-pretentious way. Even the lobby is upscale. 

They served us bread with a red pepper hummus which I'm glad I didn't fill up on, because I had the lobster roll (3) with skinny fries and loved every bite. My table also ordered off the tapas menu to sample the meatballs and caprese salad, which was a whole lot of hype for not very much food. The service was fantastic and our waitress was one of the most attentive people I've ever met. We totally overstayed our welcome but she was gracious and let us chat long after we had finished our meals. For that, I might be back to try their bakery."}
{"text":"Very bright and relaxed mediterranean restaurant. Came here with some girlfriends for summerlicious.

We got the truffle fries to start. I like that they use skinny fries. It smelled strongly of truffles, but we couldn't taste it, which was a bit disappointing. 

I ordered the pork terrine as my starter. It was a decent dish. Wish there was another piece of crostini, as there was lots of terrine left over that I ate on its own. 

Had the vegetable risotto as my main. Very lovely and creamy, slightly on the salty side. Could use a bit of pepper.

We ordered all three desserts between the three of us. Vanilla Cheesecake Lemon Crumble was rich and delicious. Served with baked strawberries and rhubarb, and a cucumber mint sauce. The strawberries and rhubarb paired well with the cheesecake. The acidity helped cut through the richness. Cucumber mint sauce tasted out of place. Not a fan of it. Coconut Lime Dacquoise was good. The dacquiose was light and tasted strongly of coconut and lime. Served with pineapple sauce and pomegranate seeds, giving the dessert a nice tropical feel. Final dessert was a mint chocolate tart served with mangoes. Mint chocolate is always a winning combo in my book. Mangoes were nice, but didn't go with the rest of the dessert in my opinion.

We were sat right next to the open kitchen which was very entertaining. The kitchen staff were super nice and very funny. Joked around with us a bit whenever they had a spare moment. Service was a little slow for my liking though."}
{"text":"So I've (grudgingly) decided to finally share my little secret with you because I love this place and it deserves the recognition and to do well. I had gotten rather tired by my (limited) selection of quick, early morning breakfast-y foods near work so thought I'd check this place out. I'd seen the construction of this place happening all summer long and could see the snazzy decor (white marble counters everywhere, high leather stools, lovely banquettes, cloth napkins etc). When I finally wandered in here, I was expecting snootiness, an overpriced menu and disappointment. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The staff are all SO friendly and welcoming. The price of one of the lovely eggy, cheesy, herbal goodness in a bun (unglamorously named the Breakfast Roll) costs less than a mediocre, pre-packaged, overpriced breakfast sandwich at Starbucks or fast food breakfast joint. They also have this great German Breakfast Sandwich (that I love because I usually need protein for breakfast vs. pastries). Everything is baked in-house and guess what? You know when you see beautiful baked goods that taste like crap? Not these! Everything I've eaten here has been wonderful. They've also just come out with a bunch of gorgeous new pastries (am itching to try the fruity custard danish beauties, not to mention every kind of beautiful bread they make there and every other item on their menu). I've also had the cinnamon bread (the best you'll find anywhere) and some other pastries. Every single one was excellent! The kind, friendly and thoughtful service that I receive from Vanessa, Maria, Ruth and Nathaniel every morning makes me feel like royalty. It keeps me coming back over and over again. I love the heavy cutlery here! They also sell their own Ricarda's brand of coffee beans and lots of hot (and cold) drink options. They also offer Mighty Leaf teas (which are fantastic). And this is just the breakfasts. They also have take out lunches (gorgeous looking salads, sandwiches etc)! Having my breakfast here starts off my day in a perfect way. I have yet to make it there for lunch or dinner, but I look forward to when I can because this place doesn't disappoint! Oh, and be sure to check out the beautifully appointed washrooms as well! They open at 7 a.m. and it's a satisfying way to start my day in the quiet elegance of this beautiful restaurant. Honestly, I feel like one of these gorgeous loaves of bread or some of the stunning pastries would make an excellent hostess gift! You can also see the bakers and chefs all prepping for the day, starting everything from scratch - now that's dedication. Can't wait to try lunch and dinner here!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty average, nothing amazing. The restaurant is big not intimate at all good for large groups."}
{"text":"We were a bunch of co-workers going there for lunch( 20 people), and reserved the place a week ago and ordered our food one day before ( because we were at lunch break and we were in rush). They did not prepare our food on time, and we stayed there for 1 hour for the food, which made few of us not having lunch and taking that to the office. One of the waitress,an Asian girl, was so rude and mean about the delay. we ended up speaking with the manager about all these stuffs. he and the rest of the people working there were really nice people. they sent us the apology email and gave us free desert (cookies). 
in general, the restaurant is a nice, luxury place and the food is good."}
{"text":"Another coffee shop I visited during my visit to Toronto. This was just ok, the service was good and seating area was great but the coffee was meh. I thought the temperature of the coffee was not great and the cranberry cookie was not crunchy or chewy, a weird bland texture. A great place to have a meeting, well priced but won't be running back."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and ambience, and pretty good customer service. Tried out with 3 girlfriends and was happy to see that they were not too busy for a Friday night! We ordered mains and dessert to follow. I got the black and yellow fettuccini and it was good but it felt a bit under-seasoned so I asked for extra black pepper. For dessert we got the chocolate pavlova and that was literally a piece of art! So pretty -  it is almost hard to want to eat it! But it was yummy! Next time I'm getting the tiramisu! Place is a bit pricey, but good if you're dining for a special occasion or as a nice little treat for yourself once in a while!"}
{"text":"My friend went to the opening ceremony and she highly recommended this restaurant to me and my husband. The location is just steps away from our home which is convenient for us and the presentations and atmosphere are great. I also love the indoor decors actually.

I ordered the scallop and my husband ordered the lamb chop. What we didn't understand was we had the same sauce for the two different dishes.The scallops were big enough and tasted not bad. But the lamb was not really good. It had the specifical lamb smell which I didn't like it. I doubt if the lamb was fresh or frozen.

It's a new restaurant so there are more space to progress. May be will go for a revisit after a period of time."}
{"text":"Originally made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday, was emailed back to come earlier with no specific time given as to when they had preferred. I then offered to come in at 7pm which they could accommodate.

When we arrived we were quickly seated but the place had many available seats open. (Not sure why they preferred that we come anyearlier). Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We weren't originally going to order alcohol but another staff member came by asking if we needed help ordering a drink (she made the drinks list), and was offered to sample some wine, and even added some sweetener to my rose (I like my wine very sweet). 

Our mains came before our appetizer which wasn't a big deal but there was a mix up in the kitchen. 


We ordered:

Fritto Misto $18 (were told it's a blend of lightly fried seafood and some vegetables). It was a small bowl of tempura tasting vegetables (we had this in Italy before and the batter tasted completely different). And there was only one large shrimp in the small dish which was very disappointing.

Honey Braised Lamb Shank $29 came with pomegranate rice and tabbouleh. The sides weren't very special and we actually didn't like the taste of the rice and tabbouleh was very dry. The lamb itself was fairly big and filling.

Lemon Saffron Linguine $20. Came with hand-made pasta, mushrooms, calamaretti, and some vegetables. Again, was a little dry for my liking.

Lastly we asked about the dessert sampling platter at the start of the meal which included a little bit of each of the desserts on the menu. When we were ready to order, the manager came over to tell us due to the pricing of the ingredients the dish now costs $27, not the $15 that is listed...
So we deliberated and decided that we still wanted to try all the deserts this place is known for, our waitress let us know the dish actually costs $25, not $27. (I don't know if they just decided this as we were ordering because it seemed pretty odd the prices kept changing and after we ordered, most of the tables ordered the same thing). 

Dessert Platter: selection of 4 out of 6 desserts listed and I have to say, none of them really stood out as a favourite. All were presented very elegantly but the taste was a bit bland.

Overall the ambience/space and service was very classy and friendly, but I think I would only come back here for drinks and not the food."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning and was surprised how quiet it was. I guess we were a little early (~10:30am).

I ordered the eggs benedict and it was SO delicious. I'm not much of a breakfast/brunch kind of gal but this place was really good! Served with fresh fruits.. it was the perfect portion.

The décor inside is very instagram worthy. Open kitchen, marble countertops, modern décor.. love it!

I will definitely be back if I am ever downtown!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. The ambiance is awesome-the space is stunning and bright. There was no line, which was a huge plus. Service was great. One of my friends has a ton of food intolerances and they were extremely accommodating to her needs, essentially creating a custom dish for her. I ordered the cinnamon roll french toast. It wasn't exactly what I expected (not an actual cinammon roll, but bread with a ribbon of delicious cinnamon threaded throughout) but tasty. I also would have appreciated if they put the syrup on the side so that I could add the amount I wanted, rather than drizzling it across the plate, but not a big deal, I'm sure I could ask for syrup on the side next time. My only qualm was that the side of bacon we ordered was swimming in grease. I know, bacon is greasy, but usually it doesn't arrive in a literal pool of bacon fat. Anyway, in spite of the minor issues, we really enjoyed our meal! Looking forward to trying out the Sunday jazz brunch buffet one day."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is not busier.  Lovely bright new restaurant.  We sat at a high table I the bar for a cocktail and some apps.  Great veal carpaccio and a really tasty and different take on caprese salad.

They also have an adjoining atrium and separate bar for events and private parties.

We will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Ricarda's 134 is a newly opened restaurant with Mediterranean style dishes. I love the interior of the restaurant. It's very clean and sleek looking. The service was amazing. All the servers and the manager were really nice. 

We tried the charred monteforte halloumi, smoked octopus,the Aegean seafood pasta, the prosciutto wrapped chicken, and the cardamom honey glazed duck breast. Of the dishes, the seafood linguine and the prosciutto wrapped chicken were my favourite dishes. The chicken was nice and moist. As for desserts, we ordered the panna cotta, pistachio cake and the chocolate ganache torte. My favourite dessert would have to be the panna cotta hands down. It has the right amount of flavour and it wasn't too sweet. I found the pistachio cake to be a bit disappointing as it was a bit too dry. The chocolate ganache torte is good for those who love their sweets and chocolate. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.....excellent ambiance ( open concept and you can see the kitchen at work) and all of our food orders were delicious. The service on a Saturday night was wonderful....we had  a friendly and knowledgeable waiter. 

Our octopus appetizer was tasty and prepared to perfection. The bouillibaise main was superb and the broth was perfect. Our dinner companions share the rack of lamb and it looked great.....and they said it was perfectly done.   

So why just 4 stars......the place is great but pricey.....and the portions could be a little  bigger. If you have a larger appetite... Expect to pay $100 per couple without drinks.

Overall......I'd go back again for special occasions. Apparently, they do a great brunch...  Which we will need to try."}
{"text":"Went to Ricarda's for romantic dinner with my wife. We started with a couple of tapas. (Mussels & Mezzo platter) both were excellent. 

For our main we got the whore rack of Ontario lamb, cook medium, with the asparagus and rosemary potatoes as sides. The lamb was perfectly cooked, as were both sides. The lamb melted in your mouth!

For dessert my wife had the Milk Chocolate Pravola and I had the Beet Goat Cheesecake. Both desserts were incredible.

Service was very attentive the whole evening.

Overall we loved our dinner and will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff. 
Incredible design. 
Incredible kitchen. 

Quietly fantastic."}
{"text":"When I stepped into Ricarda's I immediately thought \"business lunch'. The television series \"Suits\" is usually filmed here which sorta makes it a cool place. The restaurant is so large and airy and spacious. For me it screams business lunch and why not since the entertainment district is a few blocks away. It's a little on the fancier end with a wide selection of wines and different menus for lunch and dinner. 

The kitchen is quite visible to diners. We were served three selection of breads with a dried roasted tomato dip on the house. As I was walking out I later saw one of the cooks dipping it out from a packaged container with no label. Not sure what was happening with that. 

I ordered the lunch special for $16. It was worth the price. A baked flatbread laid out in on a wooden platter and cut into pizza-like slices. It was the right temperature when it was served to me. It was baked with oozy gooey cheeze, red peppers, tuna, shrimp-all drizzled on a pesto sauce. A fresh handful of baby arugula as garnish made this baby so delicious. Lunch was satisfying to say the least. The postcards served with the bill is a nice way to end time spent here. It is quite unique to this place. 

What I didn't like about dining here was the fact that the restaurant was empty yet our food took more than 45minutes to come out."}
{"text":"First time in Ricarda's and as others have mentioned it has a great decor and friendly staff. But that's about it in terms of what it has going for them. The food is just bland. In my table we ordered: 1 Mushroom Duxelles, 2 Mushroom Linguine and 1 Crispy Baby Red Snapper and the flavours were underwhelming as in seasoned very lightly or not at all. Expected more from this place."}
{"text":"First of all, I really wanted to love this place. I went for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. 
The pros: good service. Lovely interior. Watermelon mojito was delicious (but pricey for the small size- 17$) 
My boyfriend had the lobster sliders and the bouillonbaisse. He said both were good. Lobster sliders were a big portion for a starter. 
The cons:
I started with their take on a caprese. It was AWFUL. I completely understand what they were trying to accomplish to make a caprese different, but it was terribly executed. The best I can call it was interesting. The tomatoes were incredibly salty, and I love salt. It was just really bad. 
I finished with the ravioli. The sauce was great, incredibly creamy. However, I got 3 pastas. Three! And they were not large. Thankfully I had eaten every salty tomato from before or I would have been starving.
Overall, nice atmosphere, good service, but be careful what you order."}
{"text":"So I pass this restaurant every day and love the colourful bikes being displayed in their windows...I decided to go in for Lunch today.

They have a lot of options from house made pastas, to house made flat breads, to house made everything...you get my drift it's all house made.

For my appetizer I decided to go for Toulon flat bread which had words such as spicy duck sausage, sliced potato, red onion, egg, rosemary, stracciatella  @ $14.00.

For my main I chose the Arctic Char, which my waiter through me off by asking how would you like it--so I said \" extra chaaary\" (-:
It came pan-seared with cauliflower purée, frisée salad, caper salsa, pomegranate and sunflower seeds
@ $21.00.

They also brought over a bread plate with variety of their \"house made\" breads and pepper hummus dip which is a break from cold lame butter at other restaurants...it was delish...

Verdict: 

Arctic char is the best I have ever had in the whole city nice warm, crunches of pomegranates with every bite ahhhmazing purée omg soooo good....

Duck Sausage flat bread was Devine but it was definitely too large for one person...

I have eaten at several \"hoity toity\" restaurants and the food has been average...This place gets my 5 stars for gourmet food, presentation, customer service, and down to earth atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I am surprised Ricarda's is not more popular. The decor here is modern and swanky. There is a nice bar area, a bakery section that bakes bread fresh every day and a very nice dining area.

The prices here range anywhere from mid-range to pricey (just under $20 for pasta dishes, high 20's for mains, and anywhere from around $40-90's for big sharing dishes). You can definitely get a great meal here at a reasonable price.

Me and my friend ordered:
- Bouillabaisse ($26): This is a different type of bouillabaisse where the soup is separated from the seafood. I got a good sized portion of fish, mussles, clams, prawn and scallop. The soup itself was very delicious (intense lobster bisque flavour, not overly salty). The crostinis provided were a perfect complement to the soup. Yum!

- Honey braised lamb shank ($28): Also a very good dish. Lamb shank was braised well (tender) and was very flavourful. A good portion of tabbouleh and jeweled pomergranate rice were given as sides and they were both very delicious. 

I have heard mixed things about their seafood brunch but given my experience here for dinner, I am definitely looking to come back again and would be more than willing to try their brunch at some point.

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Five star service and dinning experience! 

I have a really easy rating system, 2 stars for taste, 1 star for value/price, 1 star for ambience and 1 star for service. If the resto delivers on all the criteria, they get 5 stars. 

Let's start with the food, the DIY pasta was the winner of the night. Everyone who made their own pasta loved it. My sister thought her pasta was a bit too Al dente and told our server, he offered to remake it without any questions asked and actually came back to tell us the chief agreed it was a bit on the Al dente side. I have never encounter a chief that owns up to their mistake!  I thought that was quite honourable. 

As for value, the DIY pasta cost $17 while most of the main entree hover around $20-$25 with very Generous portions. 

The restaurant looked very sophisticated and chic with very inviting spaces like their lounge area and booths. 

Last but not least, the service!! It was top notch.  Our main server Britney was super friendly and was also supported by a team of other servers that genuinely looked like they care about you.  We bought a cake for my sister's bday, not only they plate it for us, they even decorated with fresh fruits!    A really nice gesture that earned them the 5 star rating. 

I will definitely come back and you should give Ricarda's a shot."}
{"text":"Good food and service. It's been beautifully renovated. I went at 1pm for a late brunch at the end of the live Jazz performance. There was jazz music playing over the speaks, but if you want a live performance come earlier. My main waitress was not very attentive but her colleague jumped in and was great along with everyone else I met."}
{"text":"Fabulous Easter birthday brunch with family! An array of wonderful food, great service! Only complaint was we went for Sunday Easter brunch today, and due to the fact that they wanna squeeze in 2 seating a, felt slightly bit rushed! 11-1pm, 1-3pm (second seating) 
Made reservations for 12pm, they called w days prior to reconfirm & had informed us of their two time frame, so was encouraged to move it to 11am! At about 12:30, the hostess came by to inform us the brunch will be ending shortly in 15 mins and the waiter will come by with the check in preparation for the 1pm crew. It was nice
Of them to inform us so politely, 2 hrs for brunch seems enough time but for slow eaters it may feel a bit rushed. According to our waiter, it's only two season due to the Easter brunch being so full. Hence they tried to do 2 seating, usually is more relaxed! 

Wonderful atmosphere, Sundays they even have a live Jazz band playing which put it in a very relaxed Sunday vibe. Sunday brunch is $55 pp with the option of adding bottomless Cava, Caesars and other boozy drinks.
Love the made to order pan seared foie gras which was hidden in with the omelette station! Delicious anti pasta station! I completely missed the pizza waffle station at the entrance on the right! 
Very tender roast beef, even tho I had the ends it was nice and tender and very flavourful, however no Au jus?!? 
Nice selection of seafood; freshly shucked oysters, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, mussels all on a bed of ice spread. 
There's also a made to order pasta station, I thought the order would be small and tiny but it was a full size portion! They take ur order and give u a pager for when the food is ready for pickup! 
Their dessert was heavenly. Nice petit size so u can try them all! Would be nice to have some macarons thrown into the mix! There was also a supervised kids station with bouncy castle and decorate your own cupcakes for kids at the back of the restaurant which is connected to the building lobby! Very considerate so it's definitely a kids friendly place! Not sure if it's only during Easter though! 
Definitely a great birthday treat!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located at Spadina Avenue and Richmond Street West. Plenty of cool shops in the to explore before/after your meal here, especially if you venture off to Queen Street West. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Hands down the best service ever. Our server even gave us a tour of the brunch buffet! She always checked on our table, was professional, yet also super personable. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
So elegant and beautiful. The placement of every single piece of decor was well thought-out and extremely aesthetically-pleasing. 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
Mind-blowingly high-quality and fresh ingredients for a brunch buffet. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Sunday Jazz Brunch Buffet - $59.00: the highlight of this brunch buffet was definitely the seafood station with cocktail shrimps, fresh oysters, and scallops. The meats were also cooked to perfection, and there were ample varieties of salads and other greens. There's also a station where the chef prepares a fresh omelettes and foie grois. 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
My visit to Ricarda's was hands down one of my favourite dining experiences. From the top-quality service and live Jazz music to the value of the food, I would definitely recommend this place for special occasions, or if you just want to enjoy a phenomenal Sunday brunch buffet"}
{"text":"Located in the new landmark, QRC West building, Ricarda's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Always friendly and efficient service, the capps are good and the bread and pastries are a nice way to round out your visit in the high tops by the cafe or in the open building atrium while taking in the stunning architecture of Sweeney, Sterling, Finlayson & Co., reminiscent of Santiago Calatrava's ground breaking work at BCE Place. 
Full sit-down meals are good as well and decently priced. I prefer the lighter dishes to their heavier offerings."}
{"text":"This past summer, I tried Ricarda's for the first time for Summerlicious. The lunch menu was $23 plus taxes for their three-course meal. I had the Ricarda's Quiche, Pan-Seared Red Snapper, and Tiramisu. I enjoyed my Summerlicious meal thoroughly, and after looking at Ricarda's regular menu, this was quite a steal! The three course meal was not overly filling and hit that sweet spot of contentment. The restaurant's atmosphere is lovely, perfect for a weekend brunch or an evening dinner date. I definitely recommend checking out Ricarda's if you are looking for a slightly higher-end restaurant downtown for a date or other special occasion. If you find that it's out of your budget, definitely try it for Winterlicious or Summerlicious!"}
{"text":"New place in town... Wait staff was really friendly and gave great service.  We went with one of the pizzas that was on the menu next time will build my own...... Just the mix was not great../ pasta was fantastic...  Gorgonzola mushroom and artichoke.... Random but was really impressed with the box to go... Really nice packaging... 

Will be back. For sure..."}
{"text":"I realize that my older Jazz brunch review is going to give some serious moments of disappointment if you're expecting crab legs, a la minute menu, or abundance of different dishes all stacked pretty on the counter tops.  Don't get me wrong... they still do a great brunch buffet but as things go in business, they cut back and offering a lower ingredient value.  That being said, I still think Ricarda's brunch is still worthy of a special event.

Sitting at $55 per person, this would normally raise eyebrows for a Sunday Brunch.  A decent time out can be hitting $30 per person after tip and tax... with $55 with tax and tip, you're easily looking at $70+ and that's without any alcohol.  It ... is ... pricey BUT I will have to say the service is sincere and attentive, its a true buffet with no limitations (though it is a 2 hour seating) with 4 star restaurant quality sit down dishes, AND its in a great space.  I actually love the space.

I know I've written lots about this place but the short answer is that it's geared towards an upscale experience while still being warm and approachable.  Folded napkins on your chair while you get up... check.  Cool atmosphere with a live jazz trio ... check.  Helpful kitchen staff to tempt you with interesting dishes ... check.  There's nothing casual about this place and the restaurant shows it.  Though with exposed concrete walls & pipes veers towards the casual, the large grand windows, soft olive cloth for seats, and dark gleaming walnut woods keep it in the refined luxury.  The other crazy but great thing is that they open a kids play area (moderately monitored) with a full blown jumping castle... yes, I said it right, a jumping castle!!  For the 3 times I've been here, the place still looks shiny, new, and pristine.

As mentioned with the kitchen staff, they're very helpful and same with the dining room staff.  We had a great time ensured by our waitress... dishes cleared quickly, napkins folded nicely, and our coffee kept up to the brim.

About the food... the quality is there.  It exceeds most regular brunch places... let alone a brunch buffet where you expect the quality to dip.  If Ricarda's had to cut back, I do appreciate that decided to go with quality than maintain quantity.  Though I had to admit that I was genuinely disappointed when I first walked among the dishes, my first times here had me deciding how to pace myself because there were TOO many great dishes to choose.  This time around, I found myself just browsing to make up a balanced plate not filled with dessert.

I wont go into all the items available but I will highlight some great things.  In general, there are always at least 2 or 3 flat bread pizza with interesting toppings like proscuitto, a charcuterie and cheese area with a good offering of 3 each, a decent salad offering with vegetables beyond the typical romaine, unseasonal tomato, and maybe some carrots... I appreciate the grilled mushrooms, peppers, baby kale, and other interesting varieties, large freshly sliced meat (I think we had a pork and roast beef that day), a small but curated seafood area of mostly oyster, small scallops salad, chilled shrimp, and chilled mussels (No more crab legs ... oh well), breakfast baked treats like croissants, regular bread like focaccia, fresh sliced fruits, made to order omelette bar and you can get foie gras, made to order pasta bar, waffles, crepes, bacon... ok, I think you get the general idea.

Favourite items

Chilled shrimp - though they were as giant a year ago, these are still bigger than your average place and they were plump without being water logged or soggy
Egg Benedict - you can order this fresh and my picture is not photoshopped ... the sauce does glisten nicely and with the most oozy molten yolk.  I wouldnt say this is my favourite in the city but it was very good especially for a buffet
Mediterrean Calamari in a stew - there's a small section with 3 large cast iron pots filled with 'stew's.  I know they dont necessarily look appetizing at first but grab one.  I dunno how they kept the calamari so tender in there but wow, this was one of my favourite things to eat.  Vibrant spices that just perks you up... pour this on top of coucous or rice and you got a perfect winter meal.
Dessert section... like all of it - Cool thing, the head pastry chef is there behind the table so anything you want to know  or looking for something, she's all for it and ready to share her passion.  I like the fact they do have a gluten free option too.  The panna cotta, caramel banana cake, pavlova (I love my a pavlova and these bite size versions were perfect), and cannoli were just bomb.  

I would say that Ricarda still excels for Toronto buffet brunch offering but if you're from Asia or a big city like New York or Dubai, please temper your expectations.  I would say a year ago that Ricarda's did well and could potentially keep up with the food offerings but sadly not quite now."}
{"text":"In prime location in the entertainment district of Toronto near Spidina not far from Scotia bank movie theater. This place is hoping during Sundays for great brunches buffet ($55) while listening to jazz. We went on Saturday since it just announced that the restaurant will extend brunches into Saturday too. Our group got Isreali Couscous Salad with chicken, lamb burgers, marinated salmon on avocado toast, almond croissants, and steak shears. Drank red vino ( my partner and crime drinks this everywhere), Capuccino and hot chocolate served in bowl cups. The Good: wow the decor is nice bright and spacious. Large banquette tables accommodate 6-8 people like where we were seated. Our waiter super friendly who spoke Parisian French.The Bad: when fully booked you may need to sit at a table surrounding a coffee table. Bad for your back when eating! Luckily for us, we got moved to a bigger seating arrangement with a real table. Tip: great for private gatherings or parties and 5 à 7 cocktail & drinks which explains some of the seating arrangements. The Ugly: Not much. Easily in top tier in Toronto for brunch. Large following on Facebook...it is pricey $$$-$$$$"}
{"text":"We were actually looking for a different restaurants when we stumbled upon this one. We popped in to look at the menu and was welcomed so warmly we decided to stay.

With a variety of high tables, low tables, both and sofa chairs there is a social setting for everyone. Our server was Keiran and she was fabulous. Knowledgable and timely.
We ordered the Lemon Saffron Linguine, the asparagus and garlic shrimp tapas. All were extremely tasty and the fresh pasta was perfectly cooked. 
The house Sauvignon blanc was a perfect pairing to the dishes but the piece de resistance was the Brioche pudding! Holy was a buttery delight. The manager, host, owner, who knows because everyone worked so well as a team, brought us a complimentary local ice wine to enjoy with our dessert to top it all off. 

I would highly recommend this place for the ambience, food and the service.
Deserves the 5 stars for sure. Will visit next time we are back."}
{"text":"Service was awful. Menu was overpriced. 

Waited for over an hour for food, all of which came out at the same time (appetizers, tapas and entrées). Compensation (comping our tapas) that was promised to us in lieu of poor service was reneged when we finally got our bills. 

Upon seeing a friend who was also dining that night, shared an identical story about poor service and late food. Definitely wasn't the dining experience we expected."}
{"text":"Came for the Monday $2 any drink (espresso based) special and left with a flat white and a beef sandwich.  A beautiful but overly priced restaurant/menu.

The sandwich was crafted well, a bit over salted with the finishing salt though.  The flat white was strong and could use a bit more micro foaming technique.

All in all I would come back for the coffee.

There are tables that surrounds the restaurant on the outside for those grabbing from the quick-to-go counter.  This is nice since it is a much more toned down relaxed environment than the beautifully designed upscale on the inside.

More sustainable methods should be considered since their bins are always overflowing and well, looks really bad with all the paper cups, plastic lids, stir sticks etc that are clearly going to the landfill.

Would love to come for dinner but the menu and the price, to me doesn't seem worth it.  Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but it didn't do it for us. The meatballs tasted like they had been frozen before, the flatbread we ordered was supposed to have walnuts and Brussels sprouts on it but neither were, and the salad we ordered was lacking in flavour. Maybe il come back for breakfast or lunch to try it, but dinner wasn't great unfortunately."}
{"text":"While visiting the city, I found this place right here on Yelp for a good quality, early breakfast. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and the smell of freshly baked pastries and breads was delightfully tantalizing. 

It was about 9 am on a weekday, so it was pretty quiet and we were seated immediately. The waiter was busy preparing for the upcoming day, but was still very attentive and helpful. I can't eat wheat, so the waiter kindly offered me options, such as making the crepe into an omelet. So I ended up getting the omelet, which came with a small bowl of super fresh fruit. My husband ordered Ricarda's classic breakfast and he loved it. 

The vibe of this place is great and it feels like stepping into a glamorous, old movie. Even the bathrooms felt classy (this is important, let's be honest)! The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars is because of the somewhat limited menu, but the food that I ordered was great so I can't complain too much.  I would love to return for dinner and drinks the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Ricarda's three times- once for dinner, once for breakfast and once for brunch. This review will focus on my brunch experience. I went on a Saturday and so did not take advantage of their famous Sunday buffet brunch (though I'd very much like to try one day). They had recently just launched the Saturday brunch menu so I was excited to see a lot of cool options with an Italian twist.

I got a saffron pasta while my fiancé opted for steak and eggs. Both were really delicious! The steak and eggs in particularly really wowed me, and it came with a side of fries - perfectly seasoned and crisp! The pasta that I got was not as brunch-like but was very tasty nevertheless. Although between the two, I would definitely say that the steak and eggs was the winner!

Overall, really loved my brunch experience especially with their new menu, and would love to come back to try their jazz brunch on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Summary: a fancy, classy place with pretty good food
Price: $40 / person
Food: 4/5
Environment: 4/5
Service: 4/5

We went to here for team lunch. I heard how expensive this place is for brunch. Apparently it is around $80 / person for weekend brunch. However, it also got a 3-course-prefix menu which is about $35 / person.

I really like this place because the service is good, food is good, environment is good, just a bit expensive.

I choose the tuna salad starter. Surprisingly, it got big chunks of tuna, the tuna is pretty fresh and tasty.
I was deciding between mushroom linguine and lamb burger for main course. Some of teammates choose lamb burger, the portion was really good and I heard it was very juicy. I chose mushroom linguine. The portion was good as well, and the linguine was nicely cooked, both tender and chewy at same.
The dessert was an art piece.
This is a definitely nice restaurant to have a fancy meal."}
{"text":"Grabbed an Apple Crumble Danish from the bakery section. They have a lot of other sweets like oatmeal cookies, macaroons, various croissants, loaves of sweet bread, pretzels, and mini cakes. The danish wasn't too sweet, which I prefer. The cashier was also very nice! 

This place has a very $$$$ brunch, but they have $2 coffee and they always run various promotions like 50% off baked goods after 4PM."}
{"text":"The decor of this place alone was enough to get it 5 stars. It instantly makes you feel as though you've entered some idyllic outdoor space with the openness and decor. 

The food and service take it over the top. Our waiter was patient and gave great recos. Everything from the cocktail menu to the entrees was great. The Nevermind will have you ready to forget it all! Light and refreshing but packs a punch. Lobster sliders were my favorite appetizer and really could have been a meal with the fries as a side. My dinner entree was the only mild letdown, branzino, because it was a bit under-seasoned. Wish I would have gotten the bouillabaisse or snapper as both looked delicious around the table. Or listened to the waiter who didn't list it amongst his faves.

I was too full for dessert, but they had a mousse and chocolate box that have my name on them if I return."}
{"text":"I celebrated my 22nd birthday here with my friend and I really enjoyed it. We reserved a table on a Saturday night and it was a correct decision because they are very busy that night. The food is so tasty. The black & yellow linguine is interesting and delicious! I also got a birthday message on my dessert plate!! 

And the service is a perfection. Definitely worths the price. The servers are very careful and warm-hearted. The supervisor came around and asked us how we were doing during the dinner for more than three times. I feel their carefulness. It made me so happy that night. It was just perfect."}
{"text":"I really liked my meal and food experience here. Everything from the staff, to the tables, decor, staff, and especially food were top notch. I don't remember what was here before, but I feel like the building and renovations really made this a beautiful space. My only complaint is the acoustics are bad, and so sound travels easily making the restaurant quite loud."}
{"text":"A ridiculously yummy find. While seemingly a busy fancy dinner spot, we had the place to ourselves on a Friday morning and enjoyed watching the staff prepare for the rest of the day! The food was outstanding and service extremely personal. Reasonably priced with good vibes, we can't wait to come back for dinner. Can't ask for anything better!! Torontos best kept secret breakfast spot."}
