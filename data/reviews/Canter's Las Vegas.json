{"text":"This Canter's appears to have no association to the Los Angeles Canter's. When the Canter's sign went up at Tivoli Village I was really excited since I had grown up in LA and went to that Canter's frequently. Ordered the Thanksgiving Dinner and Roast Brisket dinner. I assumed that the orders I received were incorrect as they were not the same as when I had had them from the LA Canter's. The Roast Brisket Dinner comes as a sandwich on rye with only a side salad and mustard. The Thanksgiving Dinner comes as turkey on bread with a mound of fried onions and mashed potatoes and gravy. There is no stuffing or cranberry sauce. After receiving the order and opening it at home the restaurant was contacted and they stated that these were in fact the correct items despite the menu (and previous orders) stating otherwise. If you're expecting LA Canter's quality food, you won't find it here."}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich in town, the meat was so tender and juicy. The price and service provided were excellent by Romeo, worth the drive from Henderson!"}
{"text":"We we there on Friday 12/22/17. Horrible . The 4 of us arrived at 8:45 pm. Empty. Should have been a sign . 10-15 min just for the waitress to come over. 10 min and finally the drinks. No spoons for the tea and coffee. 1/4 glass of wine. We have another waiter get her. She goes to the other side of the room. Then the booth behind of the us their order is wrong. Still she does not come over. We leave a $20 and leave. Very sad because the original is great."}
{"text":"I was hoping that the team would realize the mis-steps at their Summerlin location and have them fixed but unfortunately more of the same poor planning and management.  The outside of the restaurant looks dead as there is no furniture. Very un-inviting.  Really looks like they were not ready to open to be quite honest.  Why do restaurant do this to themselves.  I looked around and it seems like there is supposed to be a hostess but just empty dining room.  I work in the LINQ so after I ordered my 2 pastrami sandwiches and drinks for over $40 dollars I did want to get my discount.  The cashier had to leave the front counter to find a manager to give me my discount so this took a while.  With hardly no one in line it seems like it was so difficult for what should be a simple transaction.    With so many other good options that are more reasonably priced the is not the place to go.  They also do not have any TV's anywhere so if I wasn't at work I would like to be able to see some of the playoff games but they don't have that either.  Oh yeah they also don't have any restrooms!!!  Seriously guys.  Wow.  Lots and lots of work to do if you have any chance of remaining competitive.   Surprised that the Canter's in LA is really part of this dismal representation of what I love so dearly on Fairfax."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I ever had!  We also sampled the pastrami, which was equally good.  The portion of corned beef was very generous, and the sandwich came with a choice of sides, a pickle and a pickled green tomato.    The staff that greeted us as we walked in were very friendly and offered to get us samples.  Overall an excellent choice for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food was good but rather expensive. The menu was rather limited for a Jewish deli I would expect to see fish platters ( white fish, sturgeon, cod, chubs and such) also the sandwich meats were very limited (no tongue or salami) it is just a corn beef or pastrami sandwich lunch spot nothing like Canter's on fairfax. You get a bigger bang for your buck at the Bagel Caf√© which is to bad becouse I was looking forward to Canter's, also in my opinion they would have been better off locating their restaurant in downtown Summerlin, Tivoli Villiage  is a dead mall."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The food was good. We order broiled salmon, and pastrami& soup combo. Yummy!"}
{"text":"So glad to find Canter's. Just like the original in LA with awesome Pastrami and Reuben. Best deli around."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Best Damn Pastrami Ever and the Bread ROCKS DAMMIT! Recommend the Matzo Soup and the Ruben, Deserts are F$&! Great I'd come back repeatedly to destroy some more MF Sandwiches.  Keep it real represent, Romeo is awesome server ask for her! She rocks each visit. Very impressed with the service and food!   When in doubt order all the hotdogs on the menu it's an option.   I'll be back !  Just finished desert everything above is F$&-) awesomeness like a unicorn Dancing in the wind while being chased by elf's at xmas!"}
{"text":"Walked by this place several times (was staying at the Flamingo), and decided to hit it on our last night.  Not a whole lot going on in there.    I was torn between the brisket and pastrami sandwich, so the waitress (Kelly/Kellie I think) brought us a small sample of each.  And wow am I glad she did.  I was leaning towards the brisket, but their pastrami...  Oh, MOMMY!  So moist.  So tender.  So tasty.  So want some more of that.  I ordered that, \"on anything other than rye please\" (doesn't agree with me).  We also ordered some appetizer, Fries topped with pastrami I think it was.  The appetizer was great - of course because it had that amazing pastrami on it.  But my sandwich...  She put it on on a kaiser roll that was super soft, and it was absolutely loaded with pastrami.  By far one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long, long time.  I was only able to eat half (the appetizer was big), so hauled the other half back home on the plane with me and had it (it was almost just as good) the next day.    I got a glimpse of their breakfast menu, and if I stay near there again in the future, will definitely be stopping by for a) breakfast and b) more of that awesome pastrami.  Loved this place."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is awesome! Talk about a killer corned beef sandwich! Haven't had a sandwich that good in Vegas ever. Chose potato salad as a side just because it came with the meal. Also came with a plate of pickles and tomatoes, loved the salty pickles! Tried the green tomatoes but they aren't really my thing. I could live on the corned beef and pickles alone. Be nice if they added a couple T.Vs to catch some football games on. Service was good, drink refills definitely wasn't a problem. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Pastrami sandwich!   The Brisket was amazing as well! We enjoyed the food and the friendly staff.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"VERY happy we visited for an early dinner today in spite of what now appear to be somewhat dubious  reviews. Is Canter's Las Vegas a bit pricier than some other local delicatessens? Yes. Were our Reuben Sandwiches considered small in any way? Absolutely not! Were they absolutely delicious?  YES! Was our server too nice or too soft spoken (what the heck kind of a complaint was that anyway)? She was friendly and helpful and kept our soft drinks refilled without us having to ask. What a great \"problem\" to have, right?! Was the restaurant spotless and comfy with a great atmosphere AND great tunes playing? Yes! Was every single member of the staff smiling and welcoming and happy to serve? Yes!  Will we return? A resounding YES!"}
{"text":"Over priced for the amount of food given. 3 sandwiches and kids meal was $75. No liquor either. Crazy"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Canter's more than 5 stars.  We had a challah emergency, and I called ahead to see if Canter's sold challahs.  When I was told they did, we headed there to buy one.  Their challahs are so good, however, they sell out very quickly, and they had sold out between my call and my arrival at the restaurant. The manager went far out of his way to hunt down their very last challah for me.  Everyone at Canter's was incredibly nice and helpful, and the challah was amazing. We will be back - again and again."}
{"text":"Came in last week loved the food the pastrami was to die for definitely BEST IN VEGAS!!! Our server Debbie was  sweet and spot on the entire meal thanks for suggesting that sandwich it made our day. Can't wait to try the cornedbeef."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Canters in different cities.  The food is always good, great matzo ball soup, sandwiches, etc....  but the service at the Canters Las Vegas is the shits.  The server obviously forgot our order.  It's busy, lots of customers, I understand how this can happen.  Except 3 parties got seated and completed their meals before our order arrived, and when it did arrive, as expected, the food was cold.  We asked that they prepare the dishes again.  It came back within 5 minutes - it was the exact same plate (eggs were slightly broken the first time, same eggs came out again).  So they basically popped the dish in the oven, heated it, and it came out hot this time, but dried out, as expected).  The waiter finally brought out part of our order - wrong order.  Even took down the original order wrong.    It's an hour and 15 minutes later, the place is almost empty, and WE'RE STILL WAITING.  Don't know yet how this afternoon is going to end.  They just brought out a complimentary plate of pastries for us - for a table with people with diabetes.    There's no need finishing the review.  I'm going to see if they do the right thing.  If this meal isn't comped, the management staff at Canters Deli ought to be ashamed of themselves.  Update - nope, we were still charged for the meal, but we received a whole 15% discount.  This basically means management docked the waitress from her tip, because we weren't about to tip.  I'm writing to the owners of Canters - Canters Vegas is destroying the reputation and name of this fine deli."}
{"text":"The first time I went, everything was great, the food, the service. However I was disappointed when I decided to go a few days later for take out. I had to repeat my order several times, the lady who was putting the orders together seemed confused. Then she handed me my things one at time until she realized that I still needed one more item. Finally she put everything in one bag. When I was home I noticed that my chili was wrong apparently they gave me the wrong kind and my fries looked old, like they were refried. When I called, the lady I spoke to said she would pass the message to a manager and I have yet to hear anything, its been more than a week."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously expensive for a pastrami place. Not only that, the service sucks really bad. You will indeed need like 10 credit cards like what the other reviewer said. When I ordered a pastrami sandwich, the server named Susana was super slow. Like, it was so intense to watch her take the order. she also couldn't even answer the questions I had and just responded with \"uhhhh\".  I almost thought she has some sort of a mental problem. Besides that, I ended up giving her the appropriate tip that she deserved. After she looked at it, she rolled her eyes and then completely ignored me. I asked for a cup for water, and she pretty much threw it to me. What a......  The place is horrible overall, nothing organized and rude/mentally slow server. Wouldn't recommend if this was the last place to eat in the world."}
{"text":"Brand New Deli just opened a month ago, they really have their stuff together. The food is amazing and the service is spectacular. The easiest access point is on the Promenade Around The LINQ Casino.  We'll be back for the Pastrami!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Their pastrami is delicious, so juicy and tender. Bagel is also great. maybe they can add more cream cheese on the side for me haha!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful - huge portions, fresh ingredients, friendly service. Bialy instantly sent me back to NCY.   Coming back for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"New York deli sandwiches right here in Vegas! Great food! Great vibes.  Nothing like it in town."}
{"text":"Awesome 1/2 sour pickles. Great knowledgeable waiter. Excellent food ! My wife and i will be back to try much more of this excellent food. Great value for your money."}
{"text":"Was very excited for their opening.  Was there on 10/5 for take out lunch for four people.   Spent over $80.   Unfortunately I won't be back...appears I have similar issues as others.  1. At  $20 per sandwich it's a poor value.  Good deli sandwiches should be in $14-$15 dollar range. Haven't seen anywhere near $20 in LA or San Francisco which are way higher cost of living cities.  2. Person who took my order was not trained well.  Told me my only choice for bread was rye when I tried to order a different bread...at $20 per sandwich????  3. Although menu says Swiss...there was No cheese on the four $20 sandwiches.  Kevin... you owe me 4 slices of Swiss. Potato salad portion was tiny and was not in line with $20 cost.  Kevin don't tell me you need to look into whether a shot glass of potato salad is a appropriate. You KNOW it isn't .  4. They were out of black and white cookies. Had to go elsewhere for dessert.  5. Menu way too simplified..no kreplach...you are Canters in name only. Not by menu."}
{"text":"The nicest thing that I can say about this location is that there is tremendous room for improvement. We went there late Friday morning when the restaurant was empty and were promptly greeted and seated by the friendly host. Then, it all went downhill.   Rather than boring you with the details, let's just say that the kitchen can be VERY slow and simple requests like dressing on the side are not followed. The \"famous\" pastrami was way too fatty and pretty small. The restaurant blamed the kitchen. This may be true, but as customers we just want decent food served promptly to the table, especially if we are spending over $40 for a 1/2 sandwich, soup, salad and soft drinks.   Not worth your time, effort or money."}
{"text":"Nope. Wanted to love this place after hearing about how great their CA location is. It was AWFUL. The extremely slow, unorganized service should have been our first clue of how our meal was going to go. Three different servers stopped by our table to let us know that someone else would take our order. When someone finally did, I ordered a Rueben with their \"famous\" corn beef. Probably one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had. It was dry and obviously had been sitting for a while since the melted cheese was cold and hard, the potato salad was mediocre at best and the pickle that the menu bragged about was missing (not a loss - since when I did get one after asking, it wasn't even completely pickled! What I got was more like an old cucumber dipped in vinegar). The other sandwich at our table was the brisket. Average at best, but came out on the wrong bread. The Mac n cheese that we ordered for my daughter came out of a box, was ridiculously hot and came out a good 10 minuets before the rest of the tables food. The spoon that they brought out for it was enormous! More like a serving spoon, not something that you would give a two year old (or an adult) to eat with. Our drinks stayed empty and everyone working seemed overwhelmed which didn't make sense since there were probably more employees than customers."}
{"text":"Ventured in to Canter's to satisfy a Ruben Craving.  Awesome sandwich and excellent service by Romeo.  Highly recommend for a great meal"}
{"text":"This is the best! Loved everything I ordered.  Great corned beef and enjoyed the matzoh ball soup. Service was friendly and prompt.  I will be back! Oh, farmer cheese in the blintz, I can't wait to try. Those are hard to find in Vegas."}
{"text":"Brought the family tonight. Food was great. Loved my waitress Romeo.. super kind and very helpful"}
{"text":"Upon being seated they serve you free pickles & pickled green tomatoes which were very good.    Their turkey burger lacked flavor but the sweet potato fries that accompanied it were good.  Their roast beef sandwich w/ fries was decent but pretty bland and a little overpriced at $15.95.  Their chicken strips kid's meal was good, 4 meaty strips w/ a ton of crinkle cut fries and a kid size drink for only $5.95.    We stopped by the deli on our way out to grab some dessert, a black and white cookie along w/ a chocolate cupcake w/ sprinkles.  I took two bites of the cookie and couldn't go any further cause it was stale.  It was free thanks to my yelp check in but I'll have to pass on stale food, even if its free.   The cupcake was just ok, nothing special.    So this was our first visit to Canter's, perhaps we just picked an off day or not the best menu choices but I'm in no hurry to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Stay away.  If you are hoping to find anything that resembles the original Canter's you are going to be severely disappointed because this is nothing like it and will need so much help to get close.  I will never ever (did I say never?) Come again.  Even if the food was free."}
{"text":"Best pastrami in the west ! Grand opening had its kinks but we were prepared for that. We had a great server named Marc and he took great care of us. I'm sure each day will get better and better. So happy it's finally here!"}
{"text":"Had the pastrami on rye.  It had a good amount of very tasty pastrami. I chose the macaroni salad which was ok. I was disappointed with the bakery. The reason for my 3 star rating is simple -way to expensive for the sandwich."}
{"text":"Loved the Pastrami. I actually ordered the Rachel Pastrami. Solid pickles and potato salad. Hope they follow suit from the L.A. location and offer gluten free bread soon! I will be back."}
{"text":"1st time to Canter's @ Tivoli Village!  Food was amazing & portions were HUGE!  Our server Romero was the BEST!  We'll definitely be back & be bringing friends with us next time."}
{"text":"Fabtastic happy staff love the layout resterant one side dessert and bagle on ither side very clean and appealing to public to just walk in."}
{"text":"A real deli with real, fabulous food: everything made on site, from rye bread to bagels to cheesecake to whipped cream. The Los Angeles institution moves to Las Vegas' Tivoli Village and brings its menu just as I remember it! Welcome and we will be back again and again! Our waiter, Eric, gave great service with just enough humor to add to our evening. Please do yourself a favor and check Canter's out!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was not busy whatsoever upon our arrival for a Sunday lunch. We were extremely excited to try this iconic restaurant, but were thoroughly disappointed by the service. Upon being seated, our server seemed annoyed to even be helping us. We got the minimal service from him. Taking our order, bringing our order to our table and then proceeding to have to wave him down to get our bill. The restaurant did not seem like they had a low number of staff to service the few patrons for that afternoon, but our server was seemingly swamped. He apologized for his service upon handing the bill to us, but at that point it was too late. Per the other reviews, pickles were supposed to be served before your meal. We didn't receive that. We also did not receive any followup to ask for refills on our drinks. The food became mediocre when the service was so poor. There are too many delis in this town to give this place another try with such poor service. Totally bummed it was such a bad experience."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 sandwiches to the were not stuffed with sandwich fillings, so i called them when i got back to the office. The girl that answered the phone connected me with the carver, guy i gues who cuts meat, his answer to me was i do the to go sandwiches and prepare them, i said great, the sandwiches i got 1 was good the other 2 were horrinle, dry, small, if i want to pay 17 dollars for a sandwich, nake big, meat delicious, and please when a guest calls dont tell him thats impossible! Rude and ridiculous! I will make sure to tell everyone i can, DONT GO TO CANTERS THEY THINK THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE CUSTOMER!"}
{"text":"Worst sandwiches ever went over the order about 4 times still got it wrong...just bad..."}
{"text":"There were multiple things wrong when we were here for the first time. First of all no one greeted us at the restaurant so we spoke to the person at the deli counter who told us to sit anywhere in the restaurant.  It was breakfast time so we ordered our meals. I ordered an omelet with country fried potatoes. Hubby ordered an omelet with fruit. When the food came we noticed the table hadn't been set. We had to ask for silverware and napkins.   Now the food comes and I put one piece of the country fried potatoes (which looked delicious, browned with onions and sweet peppers) I my mouth. Immediately my tongue started burning. I asked hubby to try it and he said the same thing.   Called over server and she said \" Do you want fruit instead as she took the plate of potatoes. I asked if I could have another plate of the same potatoes and she replied that they cook the potatoes in advance with CAYENNE Pepper. What??? No wonder my mouth was burning. I got a plate of hash browns instead.  At the end of our meal after we paid I asked to speak to a manager because I couldn't believe they would arbitrarily put so much spice on the potatoes and how disappointing it was. The manager took the plate to the kitchen and instead of coming over to us to tell us anything she chose to tell the server she gave us 10% discount.   I didn't want a discount. I wanted them to explain to me how and why my mouth was burning.when walking out I passed the manager I spoke with and told her I expected her to give me an explanation but she shrugged me off as she was too busy and had I waited longer she would have come over to talk to me. How UNPROFESSIONAL. So much for our first visit there."}
{"text":"What a cluster. Ignored by staff when I walked in. Had to ask person making sandwiches where to order takeout. Person taking order interrupted the conversation twice to talk with other staff. Has to ask me repeatedly what I had just said to her. Watched one sandwich get made and set aside. 5 minutes later second sandwich was not made. Someone finally picked up first sandwich and went looking for order ticket. Finally received order but the pastrami sandwich I had ordered cold was hot. Upon pointing that out was told they didn't serve cold pastrami. Would have been nice to know when I ordered."}
{"text":"Great spot. Great location. Im a NYr, and need a good deli sometimes. My mother was in from NYC visiting and she wanted to go so she could bring a sandwich home to NY for my father. He wanted to try Cantors from LA. So(he loved the sandwich BTW) But as we were waiting a nice gentleman started to talk to us and ask about how we like the place, and I told him why we were there. He told us he's Kevin, The owner. And he appreciated us being there quite a bit. Fun guy, we got to talking and now we'll likely do some business together locally here in vegas. So Cantors is great food and a great place within a great place! Also, Kevin is really a great guy and makes a fun environment. Love it! :) Take it from a NYr who knows a good deli!"}
{"text":"Not sure why people pay for this overpriced old disgusting food. We had to try this place after all the hype it was getting. We were so disappointed with everything from the watered down Matzo ball soup that tasted like old refrigerator, as a matter of fact almost everything tasted like that, to the nasty fries that had obviously been refried after sitting for who know how long. The white fish was absolutely terrible as if it was left on the counter all morning. But the worst was the country potatoes that seemed like they were from yesterday's service and reheated in a microwave. Yet again we pay for overpriced  and there's nothing they ever do. No wonder these chain restaurants are so filthy rich, they charge for cheap trash and shake you down for it, and if you disagree or complain they try to make you feel like your in the wrong."}
{"text":"Went in at 11:30 today was seated in a booth & nothing for 12 minutes,  not we will be with you or anything,  their was about 7 employees that looked at us turned away & maybe 4 booths takin up in the whole restaurant's....we got up 3 or 4 employees looked at us said nothing & we walked out !  I told the person outside who seated up that nobody acknowledged us at all in almost 15 minutes !  He said nothing...unbelievable for Las Vegas ..so we went down a hundred feet and had a wonderful lunch and Great service at Off the strip at the Linq !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Jewish deli on the west side of town, this is a great choice. Park underground at Tivoli village (or if you're lucky, find street parking)... and come up the escalator right to the restaurant entrance. I've only had their breakfasts, and they are very good. The corned beef and pastrami are delicious, and have many dishes incorporating them... breakfast sandwich, eggs Benedict, omelettes... all great choices. Bagels are made in-house and just the right combo of chewy and crisp. Friendly staff, and quick service. Only odd thing is that it seems to be empty every time I go in. I'll keep going back though :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night at 7pm. My order was messed up 2 times and we only ordered 2 items!  The place was totally empty.  We paid $5 for a hot dog that was old, cold and resembled a slim jim jerky stick.  Carmen who took our order toasted our croissant and gave us a chocolate one when we asked for a *just* a plain one in a bag. (Not toasted)  I'd understand a bit more if the place was packed.  There was only myself and husband inside the resturaunt.  How can a simple order get messed up so many times?????  With having such a \"great reputation\" as a company I REALLY expected more .  NOT WORTH GOING AGAIN"}
{"text":"Food smelled and looked great, but didn't get a chance to try it because the service was awful. We were seated and the only person to acknowledge us was the bus boy. We were very disappointed and left."}
{"text":"Just an excellent Jewish deli with great service. Their passion for their food is evident from the moment you walk in the door... immediately offering samples and telling you what they love most about their food. The waiters were hilarious and had us laughing the whole time. I had the bagel and lox and couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Kevin, thanks for your response, I guess.  You may want to check with who was working on November 5th, because your quality control was not there. The sandwich was small, the bread was not thick cut, seemed squished almost, and the meat was like thick chips of meat that had a greasy coating while the meat itself was dry. The mazto ball soup tasted like nothing, thanks for explaining to me how you make your boiled chicken water, adding no seasoning or salt explains why the soup tastes like nothing.  You definitely didn't sound at all like you cared that we had a bad experience at your restaurant, and effectively said for us not to come back, so, don't worry, if we ever get the inclination to spend $20 on a sandwich we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you are like me who has hotel reservation without breakfast plan. Then this is a perfect place to have a typical american style breakfast without breaking the bank... we did hash hash and dennys for the first 2 days but got tired of the waiting... so ventured down linq promenade and found this place next to high roller wheel. For Omelettes we tried the one with veggies and one with ham...both were very good, for side we selected hash browns and asiago cheese bagel. To wash it down we had some fresh orange juice... will definitely make this my regular breakfast place next time we are in vegas staying in this side of the strip.."}
{"text":"Amazing  place,  food and service. Josh was our server and he offered to try pastrami and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. He was fast, detailed and professional. Food was amazing, fish and chips, pastrami and cornbeef was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst dining experience yet in Vegas!!  We were initially told the hostess would be with us.  So we stood and waited.  The hostess came and sat 2 couples that came in behind us.  Then we were seated in there outdoor area which is very quaint.  We waited several minutes for the waiter who told us numerous times when he passed our table that he would be right with us.  We finally ordered and then the wait began again.  We had to go find the manager to make a complaint and ask where our food was.  At that point she sent someone else's back out to tell us they were 'plating' it at that time.  The food finally came out and the waiter came back once.  Then the wait for the bill began.  The food itself was OK, nothing to write home about. I do not recommend this establishment to ANYONE !"}
{"text":"excellent corned beef & knishes. my husband is vegan & asked questions & the girl just shrugged...he had to suggest  to her to please ask someone else. other than that, I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try canters Las Vegas... was so excited... wow what a huge disappointment.. took  over an hour to even get our food, then when it did come the matza ball soup was just broth with nothing. In it.. food was terrible.. service was even worse... management did nothing to accommodate us at all.. terrible customer service.. just awful.. they have a very limited menu.. then took over an hour to get desert.. we asked for cherry cheesecake and the waitress put maraschino cherrys on it.. lol.. they have a lot of work to do to get this place up to par"}
{"text":"Service is super slow. Took 1hour to get my food and another 10-20min to get my check after I was done. I'm glad I was paying with cash."}
{"text":"This review is only for take out matza ball soup. Real hot and tasty on rainy day. Some suggestions, though:  have sturdier containers for hot soup. Clear plastic are flimsy and can cause burns.  Need plastic soup spoons, teaspoons say we didn't plan for soup!  Also, I think cashier said bagel chips come with soup, but none were in bag. Indoor parking is the best on rainy days.  A good work in progress."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch!! Heard about the one in LA and wanted to try it in Vegas for sure! Great service! Great food!! When I go to LA I know where I'm stopping at!!"}
{"text":"The prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they serve, no side and sandwiches are small, would not go back.  This place will not survive here."}
{"text":"Omg I love it here Becka the manager is so awesome, very welcoming and full of suggestions. The best part of it all you can taste your meat before you order your food. OTUM thanks for the great service.. I will be back.. stop by and show them love."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner! So excited to have a deli with great homemade food in Summerlin!  The sandwiches are epic, my husband turns the dessert counter his favorite shopping excursion, and the service can't be beat!  Thank you Kerri!"}
{"text":"Was very excited for Canter's to open and boy I could not of been more disappointed. And I also need to remember give everyone a month or two once they open. But it was a miserable experience. First the waitress we had was probably the worst I've had in my 40 years of existence. We sat down and immediately i ordered a Dr Browns Cream soda and a cup of Matzoh Ball Soup knowing no one else would be getting an app. When the sodas come out I ask the waitress if she put in the Matzoh ball soup she said I didn't order it .    Next my friends ordered 2 quinoa salads and added chicken and my wife ordered a Ruben grilled and the bread well done. I ordered the meat platter to make my own sandwiches. The kids also ordered a hot dog and open face lox.  First thing to come out was the Ruben and it's not grilled we send it back. Next two salads come out and it's ceaser salads no where near what they ordered  and no chicken either so we send those back. The Ruben comes back out and all of the pastrami is fat.  And finally a bowl of Matzoh ball soup comes out but we had to ask for spoons 3x. Which I will say the soup was pretty good. They bring one of the quinoa salads out w a bowl of grilled chicken. Never brought second one out.  45 minutes go by and my meat platter is still not out. Eventually a sandwich w pastrami and brisket comes out just to feed me since I was hungry.  But my platter never came out. The brisket was ok.  Pastrami was all fat. So at this point it has been an hour or slightly more and it's the first time out waitress asked for refills.  At this point I spoke w the manager and let her know how upset I was.  They blamed the computer which I can understand some of it but I pointed out how bad the service was. There was one girl that was amazing that did help out some. I thought they would of probably wiped a lot of that bill off. But they removed my dish which never came anyway and gave us 50% off which is the employee discount.  And brought 4 cheesecakes slices for 6 people???  Cheesecake was good but we had to fight amongst ourselves for it. I wish I would say I won't ever go again but I will try it again later down the road.  Last but not least it's so overpriced because of the name. A pastrami sandwich on rye wo fries cost 19.99. Bagel cafe and Weiss Delis is better service, best cost and significantly better food as of now.  If this keeps up Canters has no chance"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience. Food was good service was good, no complaints. I noticed a lot of inaccurate yelp commentaries about the price. Anyone who complains about the price does not get out very often. Its still less expensive that Carnegie deli nyc was 30 years ago. Been here 3 x and we avg $30 per visit."}
{"text":"Took my son here for his birthday lunch have dined in a Canters restaurant before so was looking forward to a great lunch. Our waiter was Wade and he did a great job, seems lunch items start at 11 and we were there at 1045 but he made it happen.  The pickled tomatoes and cucumbers were wonderful and tasted great, we even had some coleslaw which was awesome. I had a Ruben and my son had a sandwich that was like the Ruben but had coleslaw vice sauerkraut. The food arrived together and was hot and tasty.  I will be going back again to try breakfast they open early. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Not good. The pastrami sandwich was a huge disappointment. They call themselves a classic, however the pastrami is only a classic if you call frozen boil in the bag meat found in your grocery store classic. The pastrami was too thick, too lean, undercooked, and tasteless. The potato latkes also we're not good - thick and gluey. I would absolutely not recommend. This is only a deli in name, not in taste or quality."}
{"text":"So glad it's close to home. Love Canter's Deli. Pastrami is out of this world and staff is fantastic."}
{"text":"Canter's is a pretty famous deli, hailing from Los Angeles. They offer a huge variety of breakfast foods, served in a nice restaurant in Tivoli village.   The Jewish deli served tasty food and it was attractively served. Service was amazing, as t was speedy and efficient.   I also had some really decent coffee. They brought almond milk for one of my coffees and for another one they brought milk and cream. I also tried the chocolate coffee cake and was very satisfied!  There is free parking at Tivoli village, and usually it is easy to park around here.   Canter's provides generous portions and it is decently priced. I will probably come back here again if I am in the west side area."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The service was good, maybe a little overbearing but it was between busy times and I think one of the servers was being trained. The pickles were bland and not ripe enough. The green tomatoes were yummy. The pastrami Reuben was just ok. Nothing special, though the rye bread was pretty good.  Onion rings were fine, a little over cooked.  Definitely not worth $50 to repeat."}
{"text":"Great spot! Chilly night and matzoh ball soup-this is  the place. Our waiter Eric was spot on with recommendations too. Great atmosphere. Super clean. Check it out."}
{"text":"So disappointing. First time here. Had to try the matzo ball soup and New York cheesecake. The matzo ball soup was very salty, no chicken or noodles and a hard matzo ball. The cheesecake was pretty good but very very small. I will not return here. When I told the waitress the soup tasted terrible and I couldn't eat it her response was \"I am sorry, the next time you come in, don't order the soup.\" What kind of response is that?? Lol  I told her that I didn't think we would be back again  oh and we were still charged for the full bowl of soup I sent back - just not good business. The best deli is Weiss on Sunset in Henderson"}
{"text":"Located in the sheek Tivoli Village shopping center, Canter's offers a vibrant open floor plan and serves New York style sammiches.   To start, 2 black and white cookies for FREE with check in. The black and white chocolate is split evenly on a short bread cookie.  I ordered the cornbeef hash with potatoes. My munchkins ordered kids portion: french toast, and chicken fingers with fries.   There is not much to say about the food...maybe it's what we ordered.   On a lighter note,  the pricing is on point and I give 3 stars to my waitress, Celia! She was very attentive and made sure we got what we needed. Thanks for the exceptional service Celia!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!? Let's start with the food. I couldn't have been more disappointed in my experience here which is hard for me because ordinarily I feel you can't go wrong with breakfast. I ordered pancakess & bacon.....simple right?? WRONG....the pancakes are tough and rubbery and the bacon grossly undercooked. I also requested a juice blend (orange & cranberry). My companion ordered a bialy.  We arrived at 9:30, ordered at 9:38, at 9:58 we are still without food and the place was NOT crowded. Yet 2 tables Sat after us received their meals and according to our server eggs and hash browns take less time to make than pancakes.  My question is WHERE???  MY companion had to leave at 10 and still hadn't received her bialy only to be told they didn't have any today. 20 min to find out they don't have what you ordered. UNACCEPTABLE. At 10 we were told they'd send a manager over. 20 min later a manager arrives....takes food away, offers to remake (I've been here nearly an hour NO THANKS).  So now with ALL the Food removed they bring me the bill. $11.26 FOR 2 JUICES. He neglected to tell me that the cranberry juice was in a can so that cost would be in addition to the price of the orange juice which was $3.90 and brought to us on 3/4 full 12 oz. cups. The 4oz can of cranberry juice $2.50. I have never had such horrible service!!  I would never patron here again!!"}
{"text":"Move along... move along...  nothing to see here...  Canter's was a must try but ultimately was nothing special.  Place was pretty much empty which was an immediate red flag.    They did give us some samples of their meat at the counter which was tasty but not mind blowing.    I chose to go with their breakfast \"served all day.\"  Bacon and 3 eggs, hash browns and a toasted bagel.  Meh... it was a simple breakfast and again nothing special.  The most disappointing part was when I checked in on Yelp...  they had an offer for two free \"black and white\" cookies, whatever those are.  So I hit \"use now\" and it said to inform their staff and show them the offer which I did.  Unfortunately, they were all out, so I said no worries what  else can you offer us instead?  The response was - nothing.    Uh ooohhhh... not a good answer considering they had a case full of pastries up front.  I'm sure the manager coulda thought of something to appease us but noooooooo...    Whatever...   My buddies all had the pastrami sandwiches which they said were ok but a bit chewy.  We also had some Chili fries and onion rings to start.  Rings were ok but not sure if ground beef with a few beans scattered around held together with melted cheese and topped with onions actually constitutes \"chili fries\"... bleh totally tasteless.  Service was good.  Our server did a great job keeping our drinks topped off and did her best to make up for the \"cookie debacle.\"  P2P is decent - not a wallet buster by any means.  Recommendation - Skip it..."}
{"text":"Horrible I went for dinner last night I ordered a turkey Reuben the meat was all chopped there was no sauerkraut and no Russian dressing. It came with matzo ball soup that had no flavor tons of onions we told the manager and all she did was take 20% off the bill I would never go back"}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich is really overrated. The meat itself was great quality, but stacked high within two skinny pieces of bread was overwhelming. Not to mention its about $20. The matzah ball soup was good. Service was fast and friendly and the inside is nice and spacious.  Will probably try something different if I ever return. The dessert selection looked great!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews. The pastrami was excellent, tender, juicy and well seasoned. I had the 1/2 Kevin's choice w/pastrami and 1/2 bowl of matzo ball soup. Received great service from Celia."}
{"text":"Canters is just a few minutes from my work and has been on my radar since they opened, but I've held off on visiting til they worked out the kinks cited in most of the initial reviews, slow service and high prices. It appears that they've tweaked the menu and most prices are now fairly reasonable, and a group meal here went well but service still seems to be an issue despite ample staffing.  SANDWICHES:  For the classic options, expect about $9 for a half, $17 for a full, stacked like Pamela Anderson. I recommend the Rachel, on rye. But I came for the Franklyn (now named \"The Best Damn Egg Sandwich\"), with steamed brisket, grilled & raw onions, melted cheese, and an egg, on an Everything bagel, plus a side, originally ~$14 now down to a reasonable $10. Sando was huge, filling, and delicious, with fresh-popped yolk drizzled into the melty cheese and plentiful, tender beef. Couldn't finish the top half of the bagel, or the side of fruit, sandwich was huge, would get again.  NOT SANDWICHES: Other reviews say that their famous pickles are served free upon seating but that wasn't our experience, ordered a half sour plate and they were solid with a mix of pickles and tomatoes. The surprise hit dish was the house-made chips with pastrami, blue cheese, and honey, for a flavor bomb of crispy-chewy, salty-sweet, shareable and reasonably priced at $8. Most orders come with a side of coleslaw, potato salad, or mac salad- the last one was the best choice. Looking forward to coming back for the latkes. Tempted by their Smoked Fish Planks, but disappointed to see they're served on regular plates and not the classic wooden planks as advertised.   BAKERY:  Use your Yelp check in for a free black & white the size of your face! They're huge and comparable to that other deli up the street. Everything in the bakery case is comically huge, like softball-sized cupcakes. Planning to return for their bagel chips, which were bagged on display throughout the dining room. Did not see rainbow cookies on either visit.   SERVICE: For our initial group visit, service was friendly but odd. I expected a wait on Sunday morning but they were empty, yet the hostess stand was unmanned and it took a while to be seated. Our server was polite and friendly but somewhat slow and inattentive (didn't offer takeout boxes, did not split bill, didn't check on us after food was served, didn't get water refills, etc). Used counter to get their bagel and coffee combo on my way into work and staff did not seem used to taking orders?"}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Canter's on fairfax and always loved it now living in Vegas I was so excited they opened up here but boy was I disappointed the bakery was horrible nothing like the one on fairfax the pickles were generic deli pickles not the ones I grew up and loved I'm used to  the high pricing and normally worth it but not this quality 3 bucks for a small cup of soda almost 20 for my sandwich which was just ok my wife ordered the turkey it was very dry I'm sad to say even when I'm go visit California I won't be stopping by for this experience ruined Canter's for me and if anyone is reading this I would really think twice eating here especially if you ever been to the one in la you'll regret it"}
{"text":"Our first visit was last evening. Our service & food quality were not satisfactory. Our waitress was chatty, but she needs to learn to listen.   We have asked for a bowl of the chicken soup, clearly repeated we wanted a bowl, and were served only a cup. We asked for roast chicken dinner and were served what looked like white boiled chicken... yuck. My pastrami sandwich was to have pickles come with it, no pickles.  My wife asked for a glass ice of water no lemon, she got water with lemon.   No listening, no quality assurance."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Service was bad.  Orders were not correct and came piecemeal.  Sandwich was cold by the time the soup came.  Will probably not come again."}
{"text":"Give them another month. Very chaotic since they just opened and the demand is overwhelming. My order came out 15 minutes before my husbands and it was incomplete. Supposed to be pastrami and Swiss on rye with mustard and it was just a hunk of meat on bread so thin that it fell apart. No cheese or mustard. When I asked about it I was told they don't do that anymore. We changed the menu. My husbands salad was brought out with the wrong dressing. Their house made pickles clearly need more time- tasted like a plain cucumber. Waiters are so hurried they run away before you can order. They ran out of a lot of things and we were warned to not order bagels as their machine was broken so they were very thin. On the plus side, the matzo ball soup is excellent. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I will give them another chance in a month. And the cheesecake is also really good."}
{"text":"Great food and enjoyed the outdoor dining. Most disappointing was our waiter. Told us how overworked he was, having worked 6 days in a row. Kept telling us how short staffed they were. And more than once we heard that. He was so overworked and tired he sat down to take our order. Told us he had 50 tables the day before and he only got $3 tips per table. Took our drink order and we wait......  My advice for that young man is quit your complaining to your customers and your tips will increase."}
{"text":"I agree Canters has the best Pastrami sandwich  in town.  I am a huge fan of pastrami sandwiches and have been to Carnegie Deli, Canters in LA and to the King of pastrami Katz's Deli in New York.  I've always felt Katz's was the best hands down.  I wasn't a great fan of Canters in LA however after dining at the Las Vegas restaurant I have changed my mind.  Our Canter's definitely gives Katz's a run for their money. Canter's pastrami is just as juicy and tender and their Rye bread is way better,  Canter's less expensive by about $5 although Katz's has more meat by about 10 to 15 %.  All in all I don't have to travel to NY or LA for a terrific pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"We will be back! Best corn beef I've ever had. We had a few questions about the menu and they were able to answer all questions and even brought us a sample before we ordered. My daughter had the turkey sandwich and loved it. Definitely a place to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a quality deli. I understand it is a LA favorite and I can understand why. Fresh food, sandwich was piled high, wonderful stop in the sea of fast food burgers."}
{"text":"On the positive side the service was excellent and the Server, Sandy, was friendly and very good. They put a dish of Kosher pickles and pickled green tomatoes on the table which were also very good and reminiscent of Katz's Deli in NYC. Here comes the \"but\". I grew up on pastrami. It is never thick sliced in a sandwich. It is never topped with melted Swiss cheese and cole slaw and it is never served on rye bread as thick as Texas toast. It was accompanied by a side order choice of cole slaw, macaroni salad or potato salad. I chose cole slaw and that was simply 'okay'. My friends did not eat their potato salad. The quantity of meat in the sandwich was fine but it certainly was not a true pastrami sandwich as claimed. Oh and the cost for sandwich, side and no drink - $20.00."}
{"text":"Ok, it's hard to rate the worst dining experience that I have ever had without actually eating but here goes.  Arrived at Canter's at 11:45am and requested a table for two.  Told 20 minutes.  Ok.  2- minutes later called for our table.  Seated outside and noticed a number of empty tables, some with place settings but no diners.  Strange?  After not being greeted at all by a server a server showed up at the table next to us that was seated 10 minutes earlier.  He explained that he didn't know he had any outside tables.  After taking their drink orders he proclaimed that he would be \"back with their drink orders when he could\".  Uh oh.  Another 10 minutes goes by and no server.  The couple behind us gets irritated and leaves, no server.  They pass by a couple of ladies seated to our left and exchanged stories about the lack of service.  One lady goes inside to see what is going on.  Mean while I stop one of the greeters who has now seated yet another couple, ironically at the table where the people just walked out.  I tell him we haven't seen a server, he mumbles something about seeing what is going on and goes inside.  We wait another 10 minutes and decide to leave.  On my way out I tell the young ladies at their stand about not seeing a server.  They slightly apologize but knew what was, or wasn't going on.  Not their fault.  This is a breakdown of the highest order. A lack of managerial skills with the blame to be squarely placed at the feet of the owner, manager, and shift manager.  If Canter's in L.A. have just leased out their name to these people, they need to be careful about their brand, these people are ruining it.  By the was, we left Canter's and walked down to Virgil's Real BBQ, it was amazing.  Seated immediately and greeted by our server within 2 minutes, and it was crowded too!!  The photo I am sharing shows the empty tables outside right before we left.  Empty tables but still a 20 minute wait and a lot of people waiting for a table.  Canter's should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"We were excited to go here after waiting for the opening. The restaurant was clean, liked the decor. But the problems started right away. They weren't that busy, lots of seating and it took some time to sit us in one of the many available booths. It then took awhile to get our drink order, then another wait to order. Our food, latkes, soup and sandwiches actually came fairly promptly. The soup was watery. The sandwiches were boring, while the meat quality of the pastrami was good, the brisket was visibly dry. It was meat and bread on a plate,  no sauces, no sides. It took a good 10/15 minutes to get a a to go order of some pastries. The service overall was very very slow, extremely slow, except for one young man who was very nice and prompt. He brought us boxes after asking one lady for a box that seemed to have forgotten. And they were not busy.. Then the problems with the bill began. $77 for lunch for 3 adults and one child. We wanted to split it three ways, not an unreasonable request. Instead one card was charged the full amount and it took 20 minutes and three managers to fix it, however they couldn't produce a void receipt. During this time I suggested that with all the problems we call it a day, to which I got blank stares. One lady did come over and ask if we were ok, as we were visibly upset. She listened then walked away.  What should have taken 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours for mediocre food and poor service. First time ever I didn't leave a tip.  Oh, and while they do have a nice kids menu there is no changing table in the bathroom.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Latkes were horrible ! Looked more like McDonald's hash browns. Had to send them back. Pastrami sandwich was not served warm & the bread was at room temperature at best & fell apart. Cole slaw was good just missing a little more vinegar but is was wet like it should be. Staff very inexperienced & didn't know what a LEO was when I ordered it & I won that bet with my friend. Was asked twice what type of bagel I wanted & when the LEO came out no bagel came with it.I  ordered a chocolate egg cream & was asked twice & a vanilla one came out. Wasn't going to complain about that. The one good thing as far as the food was the chopped liver but it didn't come out with the toast & had to ask the server for the toast. The server was very pleasant but we saw lots of people complaining & we can't blame her for no bagel or toast that's an expeditors job in the kitchen to send out want accompanies each dish to make it complete. On the way out I stopped at the hostess stand to lodge my complaints a very nice blonde lady I think Catarina was her name & she took my info but seemed clueless that the sandwich should be served steaming hot. Said the Micros had been down was one excuse for the 40 minute ticket wait times & that they were taking all the feedback & trying to iron things out. I told my friend we should not go until they were open a couple of weeks but he insisted in going on day 3. In my professional opinion they had no business being open yet & not having it together. I know they are good in LA & this was a big disappointment. I'm a Summerlin resident & was looking forward to being a regular but won't be back for at least another month. So it's back to Greenbergs at the NY NY hotel. I hope I get some feedback & hope the learn how to make potato Latkes!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  In a town where good freindly service is lost, this place has it.  Chad our server was great.  The food was top notch.  Pastrami is a must."}
{"text":"We went to Canter's for lunch today. We are huge \" New York Style\" deli fans and have been to many famous delis across the country. We were initially hesitant to visit because of the number of negative reviews but as business owners ourselves my husband and are always aware of how hard it is to run a business and feel most places need a chance. When we walk up the place was almost empty, a bit worrisome but we decided to give it a chance. The young lady who initially greeted us was friendly and smiling. However, when she asked one of her female teammates to seat us outside the young lady charged with the task seemed incredibly put out and in addition to the eye roll we are pretty sure that we heard a sigh. She, without any enthusiasm proceeded to lead us into the inside dining room. When asked to please be seated outside, she obliged and graced us with more eye rolls and sighs. When we asked if we could take the table in the sun rather than shade we thought for sure she was going to lose it. This one small statures young lady could in our opinion lead to the restaurants closing. She needs to not work around people.   On a positive note... Q, our server was awesome. He deserves the biggest kudos for his customer service, attentiveness, positive attitude and humor. He watched over and took care of us ensuring that even though our wait for our sandwiches was unreasonably long that he made us as comfortable as possible. I would hire him in a heartbeat and he is a true asset.   The food, I had the Rachel and my husband had the Pastrami. Both sandwiches were good size, smaller than I remember from the other Canter's but still more then I could finish. Meat was plentiful, juicy and tasty, potato salad not so much. Portion size was okay but it had 0 flavor.   We would probably come back because of Q's hospitality and the meat  but might turn away and change our mind  if the unpleasant young lady is the one greeting guests.   The quote \" it takes 1 bad apple to spoil the batch\" really applies."}
{"text":"Look, I am not a Yelp Elite reviewer (although I probably should be) and I don't work for a magazine putting claims out there that a restaurant that just opened the doors it the new hot place in town and potentially lining my own pocket. Driving by Canters on the west side of town and looking in you would clearly see this is not the case. The restaurant is always quiet during dinner time and even lunch. Rarely do I see a lot of people in there, and we go by that location and area often because we frequent other locations in that area and outdoor mall...  After leaving my first review, I had received a reply from the owner of the location, as you can see telling me about the quality of the meats, the cuts, this and that, blablabla...then i received a PM a week or 2 later inviting me to come down and go over my ideas of the place, free meal on the house. So i have been thinking about it, and decided actually to go there again without letting them know I was going in, when i had the time or was in the area and just see how it is going since my last review and many more negative and positive reviews.  So anyway, went back there and thought about it and right before i went in this time I picked up the phone and called Canters in LA (located on Fairfax and Beverly-ish) and I asked the guy that answered the phone if the Canters in Las Vegas was the same as the one there in LA and his reply...NO, WE ARE NOT RELATED TO THE CANTERS IN LAS VEGAS THEY ARE JUST A FRANCHISE... nothing more. In fact this guy has gotten plenty of these calls also, so I was not the only one asking about this. Just a Proof of concept to see if a franchise would work out. The guy also told me they support them with the food or concept and that is it, nothing more than a franchise. More than likely a idea or agreement to see if it would work doing a franchise like Pinks did, or some of the other LA hot spots have tried...  After hearing it was a franchise, that was pretty much that, i just kept on driving.  I really don't get it. why do you insist on telling people you're the same as the one in LA, same owners, same this and that when your renting the name? Look, not all franchises make it, not all franchisees know what they are doing. It happens. Just stop making these fluff up stories that LV Canters is the same as LA canters because it's not. It is just the name.  When a McDonald's opens up on a corner, it more than likely is not the same as the one 2 miles away. Nor are 2 subway's a like. Point is again, just because you rent the name Canters does not mean you are Canters.  So, just to clarify I will NOT be going back there for my free meal or even to spend some money to buy a sandwich. A little individualism goes a long way with me, especially when it comes to being a restaurant owner. Do it under your own umbrella, don't drag Canters' name through the dirt to try and win some of their LA customers that visit or relocated here.  And since I can't reply to \"business owners\" comments on my posts, please don't bother replying to this update/post. Doing so with a copy and pasted msg is just making you guys look foolish. Hell, you're even replying the same message on reviews that have nothing to do with your reply. Not professional, not classy. Just rookie stuff all around."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place based on the people who's give this place 1-3 stars. I've been here a few times now and each time it gets better. I went to this place when it first opened and it was a bit chaotic and I was not impressed with the price but the pastrami was excellent. Hot dog for the kids was over cooked and they ran out of corn beef. It was a brand new restaurant and I was expecting some hiccups. Not a big deal.  The second time we came (2weeks later because the pastrami was so good) they had a new menu with more options and the price dropped a little and I got a higher stack of pastrami. Food was flawless this time. So they were quickly adjusting to the make customers happy. This was a very quick turn around!  I recently saw they have only a 3 star average and I don't think this is very fair. Most of the people are complaining about hot dogs....who come to Canter's for a hot dog? I get it if the kids want it. My older kid shares a Rachel with her mom. Also I've always had great servers.   Best part, they now have a punch card! Buy 4 sandwiches and get the 5th free!!!!  Best punch card value in town!!! The server remembered us from our previous visit and was nice enough to give us credit for our previous visits.   Like I said, it gets better every visit and I will continue to recommend this place to my friends. Especially now that they have a punch card!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Service was great. Happy they finally arrived to Tivoli.   But..... the prices are pretty steep. 1 pastrami sandwich and a beer $20 + tip.   Strip pricing for locals. Don't mix, pricing was a surprise."}
{"text":"Holy cow everything on the strip is expensive. Regardless the food here was pretty legit. I coukd eat pastrami sandwiches like this for dayzzz.  Dont forget your free cookie with check in, it was tasty while we waited literally forever for our food to show up.  Ordering takeout was super awkward, none of the staff acknowledged us for quite some time amd there was multiple places to order from."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast.  We had the pastrami and corned beef with cheese and egg on rye.   Delicious  Going back tomorrow for lunchtime.   We are back again for Reuben Sandwich and knish"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Canter's on Fairfax for decades & was excited to hear about the 2 outlets in Las Vegas.  I lunched at the Tivoli Village location Friday, Jan 26; found it to be only a bit less wonderful than the Fairfax location.  The corned beef has the same great flavor.  Had a most enjoyable visit with owner Kevin J -- a man who knows the food business around the world.  Las Vegas is lucky to have Kevin & his family bringing truly 1st class deli food to southern NV.  (I noted below someone suggesting Canter's isn't up to NYC standards; I've taste-tested Katz' & the 2nd Av Deli -- neither matches Canter's [while the Carnegie Deli went out of business in 2016 after being found to have been stealing utilities from their neighbors].)"}
{"text":"Today is the second time we've dined at Canters Las Vegas deli, and both times were wonderful.  The food, service & ambiance are all first rate.  And it's a good value.  The portions are generous and we always leave feeling happy & satisfied.  We shall definitely return"}
{"text":"Props to their customer service skills.  A to-go order was slightly off and Jo, the manager, made things right for me.  The youngsters at the counter in the afternoon were personable too.  Aside from the cheerful crew, Canter's pastrami is unique and unlike others.  It tastes like someone yanked it out of the oven and slapped it directly on my sandwich....as opposed to the typical shaved pastrami you get elsewhere that was probably packaged weeks ago.  I will gladly pay a few extra bucks for something that tastes superior.  Not a fan of cream-filled eclairs, but their apple crisp squares are excellent.  All in all, some real nice-tasting chow here.   As I left, Hendrix was on my Sony Walkman and I suddenly asked her, \"Hey Jo, where you going with that knish in your hand?\"  She smiled and told me I needed to upgrade my electronics.  On point again."}
{"text":"Came in for a bite and loved it the pastrami  was amazing with the coleslaw on the side my server was very sweet and she came by to check on me a couple times will be back to try some of the cherry cheesecake she mentioned"}
{"text":"Walked in, the place seemed clean and chill, there were barely any people inside. Ordered a pastrami, a plain bagel and mashed potatoes. The pastrami was insanely thick cut, I've never seen it cut like that. The pastrami tasted like nothing, all I tasted was the rye bread. It was room temperature as was the mashed potatoes, which also had no taste to them at all, even the gravy couldn't do it justice. I just feel like for the price, it's terrible. The waitress however, (i can't remember her name) was very polite and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. Oh, and the bagel was pretty good. Probably the only thing I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I had to try out the new store in Tivoli Village. It's a brand new, beautiful place and you can tell the staff are still learning.  We ordered a pastrami and Swiss on rye ($18+), a side house salad with raspberry vinaigrette dressing ($4) and an extra kosher pickle ($3.50).  I'm giving three stars for several reasons: 1. What we received was a full house salad (charged $11) with Italian dressing.  - Italian dressing tasted off. Something wasn't right. Salad was pretty plain for $11 charge which we only wanted a small side salad.  2. No extra pickle that we ordered.  3. Pastrami sandwich with a kosher pickle - As many other reviews have stated, this sandwich is not worth $18+. The pastrami was hand carved and very tender, but 1/2 pound of pastrami for $18 is way overpriced. Kosher pickle that came with the sandwich was Amazing! I don't know how Canters makes their pickles, but I could eat these all day.  4. Forgot the side potato salad that came with the sandwich  - The potato salad tasted store bought. I won't go as far to say it was the grossest potato salad I've ever eaten... but I could only manage one bite. I would expect better, much better from a Jewish Deli.  5. Our server left my credit card in her chip machine and forgot to return it. When I asked for my card, she said \"oh my gosh, I keep leaving these cards in there!\" She was extremely nice and helpful as a server, and very pretty, but leaving my card behind is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Having just opened, there is definitely room for improvement.   My co-workers and I have been looking forward to adding Canter's to our list of nearby lunch choices for days when we can't stomach free EDR food. After about a year of waiting, we practically gave up on this. Needless to say, we were thrilled when it opened seemingly out of nowhere.   We made plans to have a group lunch the Wednesday after opening. After a crazy morning, those plans changed to placing a group to-go order, which one of our team members graciously took on.   Unfortunately, despite having a very clear list of everyone's choices, our team member came back to the office over an hour after leaving to find that several of the orders were wrong.   - a diet soda was missing  - crispy chicken sandwiches were replaced by grilled chicken sandwiches - reuben sandwiches were replaced by just pastrami or corned beef  - a salad that was ordered was not placed in the bag  - a few other things I can't remember since I didn't run the order  In addition, the dessert menu was not yet fully up and running. Our team member ordered what she could based on what was available. However, we were disappointed to find that a number of dessert choices were outsourced from Freed's.  Other than the service/flow issues, the food was great. Latkes were crisp and delicious. Pastrami and corned beef were juicy and tender. Bread was fresh. Matzoh ball soup was savory and deep. I'm hopeful that the kinks will be worked out and we'll have a reliable pastrami/deli option for lunch soon."}
{"text":"I grew up on good Jewish Deli. I am the daughter of a Philly Deli man. I was very excited to hear that a Jewish Deli was opening in the Linq Promenade. That excitement quickly turned to great disappoint when I got there. The corned beef is nothing but thick pieces of warmed brisket. Same for the pastrami. That is NOT how Jewish Deli is made! It must be cooked fresh in the store and sliced thinly on a meat slicer. Once it is put in a refrigerator, the good taste turns bad. Canter's does not cook their deli meats in the store. They buy it so you know it has already been refrigerated. Then, they heat it up and chop it with a knife into large chunks. Their rye bread is NOT authentic Jewish bakery rye. Who are they kidding? People who have never had good Jewish Deli on bakery rye -- that's who!!! The only good thing I had was picked green tomatoes (we call them sour tomatoes) because they were purchased from a good supplier. If you advertise that you're a Jewish Deli, then you damn well better be a Jewish Deli. Otherwise, it is false advertising!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this dungeon one star because you have to give it something. The food was terrible.  The waiter was unaware of where he was. When he gave me change for the money I spent, he gave me tons of coins on purpose out of spite because I told him the place wasnt worth the money for the experience we got. It was cold in there.  Not worth the money or time to spend on this place."}
{"text":"Sunday Dec 3rd 2017 10:45 Am we stopped in for what we thought was Canter Deli.... First of all.The only thing this place has in common with Canters is the name.They have a completely different menu recipes,presentations,service.This place is an overpriced travesty.They DO NOT serve lunch until 11 am.The potato salad and coleslaw are AWFUL.My bread on my $18 corned beef sandwich was SO stale.I asked for Mayo 3 times,I ended up getting it 15 minutes later.I needed Mayo and Mustard to mask the flavorless corned beef.I never received a refill on my iced tea after waiting for 30 minutes.Why would you take the Holy grail of Deli's and desecrate it? $40 for 2 sandwiches and 1 iced tea? You should be ashamed of yourselves.Canters Los Angeles is crying right now out of embarrassment.The service is deplorable.The food is mediocre at best.How in the world did Canters Los Angeles ever agree to this tragedy? I am making a trip to Los Angeles this week to talk to Mark at Canters to tell him how awful this place was.Then I am going to eat a real Canters Corned Beef to hopefully get the $40 bad taste out of my mouth that is Canters Las Vegas. I will never return and I will spread the world all over Vegas until you close down.Yuck."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Everyone that works here seems like they hate their job. All they do is complain. Except the cook. The food is 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"Our server was fabulous, felt bad that she had to over compensate for the long wait we endured for our order; She was very attentive and apologetic. We waiting about 30 minutes for our order whilst there were only a handful of customers in the restaurant. We started with the pickle plate, which was decent. We ordered The Pastrami sandwich and the hot dog platter. The pastrami was think cut, but nowhere near as good as Katz. The hotdog plate was delicious and came with your choice of three dogs. When I go again, probably try the corned beef or maybe stick with the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 7pm and the place was empty. Service was good and food wasn't bad but the prices are ridiculous!! A cup of vegetable soup for $7.95 is a little much. 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup $48....like I said food was good but for soup and sandwiches at those prices, I think I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I asked if they have anything vegan. I was told NO. They do have salads and other options that I found myself. I askthe server I thought you didn't have any vegan meals. Her answered was \"oh sorry I did not know\" like really!"}
{"text":"Just opened its doors 2 days ago& what a great addition to the neighborhood!    The Ruben sandwich is off the charts!!  Also ordered their matzah ball soup and a small cheese cake.think I will need to up my work-out schedule w this new Deli so close to my house!   I ordered my items to go but the sit down restaurant is very nice & their bagel & cream cheese selections look fantastic!  Tip:  sandwiches are very large & can easily be shared.  The soup & 1/2 sandwich option is a good idea!!"}
{"text":"Made it back to the Tivoli location for mid-morning meal and coffee. Doing my work, very nice. Cecilia was my waitress, so sweet and attentive. Remembered me from my last visit (a few months ago).  I usually like my bagel and butter, but this time I went for the pastrami omelet, which was the right choice. The pastrami is so good here, I think they can put it in or on anything and the dish will taste great.  I liked this place before, and I really feel it's proved itself.   The USB outlets on the walls are a nice touch. Charge my phone while I'm eating. No one does this. Small detail that I appreciate."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the Strip location. Great seating, USB chargers at each table for an easy charge, practically under the High Roller, and everything looks clean and new. Great spot to sit and relax after walking around all day.  The bagels are still my favorite, any of them toasted with butter, a perfect snack. Big portions on the meals, need to have a buddy to share with."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this place to open. We ordered the Ruben and Pastrami and egg sandwich. Omg! This is the best pastrami we've had.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative rating. This is the absolute worst place I've ever stepped foot into. The hosts were very nice and I was seated within 10 minutes of walking in, which is fine since they were really busy. But, then it took over 20 minutes for someone to finally come to our table and get us waters. Which I learned is because the managers never communicated to their staff what tables they're in charge of. The waitress that helped us was very nice and I could tell she was trying her best. I actually felt bad for her, because she has to work in this establishment.   It took an hour to get out food and the food that was brought to us was completely wrong. After waiting 15 minutes for a manager to come to our table my friend and I decided to leave. As we got up to leave we over heard a MANAGER TELLING AN EMPLOYEE TO SHUT UP, and as he was YELLING this, he had his hand OVER HER FACE!! This reaction was caused simply by the waitress trying to inform him she was taking her lunch.   I will NEVER be returning to this restaurant, and I will warn ALL of my friends and everyone that I come into contact with to steer clear of this shit show. Management clearly doesn't know what they are doing, I'm sorry for anyone that works for that disgusting human that doesn't know how to respect others."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a west coast v east thing but I thought it was all bland, the corned beef was super chewy, pickles had a savory soapy taste, potato salad was meh and the free cookies with check in were dry, and again bland!"}
{"text":"Our server, Romeo, was excellent! She was very friendly, outgoing, and knew the menu very well. She made great recommendations. The pastrami and potato latkes are definitely items I'd recommend! The service may not be as quick as most places, however it's worth it. This was a great place to enjoy dinner with my family!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of deli food always thinking it's too much meat and too heavy for my stomach. But I had a really nice lunch at this restaurant the other day had a soup with chicken and a ball with mixed fillings can't even remember its name lol but it was really good. The soup was apparently made of real chicken broth it didn't taste greasy and with the carrots just felt very healthy. I liked it and would probably try again when I'm in town next time."}
{"text":"We are so happy to finally have the iconic Canter's Deli in our neighborhood. We had a great meal and can't wait to return to try other classics off the menu. The quality was really great, as they get their meat from Katz's in NYC. We also were lucky enough to get some of Katz's butchers as well. The staff and service was great too, thank you Judy! See you soon."}
{"text":"Do not go to this Canters due to the very subpar service I received on St Pattys Day. Please I repeat PLEASE GO TO THE CANTERS LV (Tivoli Village) off of Rampart! I am usually fair about these type of situations but after consulting w/the people I went with, they agreed that this location of Canters branding needs to have some shoppers go and see how customers are being treated. We had a male waiter that was more interested in the people at another table than he was about getting us taking care of. Never again!"}
{"text":"Apparently today, Canter's Can't   They can't tell you the WiFi password and have no motivation to find out (three servers).   They can't tell the difference between regular and passion fruit iced tea (twice).   They can't put all the ingredients in a dish without a staff meeting. This was Lox, Bagel, cream cheese, tomato, onion and capers. They missed the onions and capers. Duh?  At a Deli?  If you've been to the one in LA,  DO NOT go here. You will cry."}
{"text":"We read most of the reviews while we visited and man you California transplants are rude and obnoxious. If you prefer the 'Fairfax' location then hop in your car, drive, and enjoy.  We have zero complaints. The breakfast sandwiches were excellent (Pastrami and egg? Who knew!) and the service was friendly. Those complaining about the prices should stick to McDonalds or Jack in the Box or better yet a two for one Buffett at Texas Station.   Welcome to Tivoli Village Cantors, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My kid and I ate breakfast one morning here because it was close, we ordered the pancakes with real maple syrup. Plenty for two to share you get three plate sized pancakes.the wait staff was wonderful, the food was delicious and the bill for pancakes, chocolate milk and a soda was 14.00. Visit if your in town you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would love to show you the love I ate but it was too damn good! Plus the customer service was top notch grade A like the food. The pickled tomatoes are a MUST EAT! Traditional cornbeef Rueben will leave you wanting more...it's hard to be on a plant-based diet with AMAZING food like this! Thank you"}
{"text":"Was anxious to try this new place, but it didn't take long to realize there were serious issues with staffing and training, which to me cancelled out the fairly good food.  Was seated fairly quickly and eventually got our drink order taken after waiting and noticing other tables in various stages of frustration.    That was our server's first and only appearance to the table.  The remainder of our meal was spent trying to get the attention of any staff that would return eye contact for the other things we needed for our meal...Minor details, like:  -Silverware (none on table, none brought with food, told food runner we needed but had to ask another staff member for)  Napkins (noticed I couldn't see napkins at any table).  If anyone can eat a Reuben sandwich without needing a pile of napkins, I salute you.  Beverage refills.  -No one walking through restaurant with a carafe of coffee refilling cups.  This was breakfast time.    Some type of spread for the bagel that was served dry.  No butter, jelly, anything...although they informed us they could bring cream cheese for an additional charge.  No one asked us if our food was ok, if we wanted another cup of coffee with our meal or if we were just content staring at cups that were completely dry.  I started to get the feeling that I had somehow become invisible.  Despite the inexcusable service issues, the food was pretty good.  Being upset at the bad service made it hard to enjoy."}
{"text":"We went.  We tried.  We won't be back.  The great anticipation of a real NY deli was all for naught.  When the best thing on the table is a cheeseburger, there is a problem  Corned beef was dry, sliced way too thick and tasteless.  4 out of 10.  Fish and chips was second best to the burgers, smallish bits of fish in too much batter.  Our waiter was friendly but more suited to stand-up.  He delivered a burger, announced \"burger, no onions\" and didn't even look at it or he would have seen plenty of onions poking out.  Prices are way too high for the quantity and quality of the food.  Nothing horrible, just mediocre and disappointing.  Judging by our experience, the reviews here and management responses, this restaurant needs some work."}
{"text":"The service was excellent (that's why I gave it 3 stars). Unfortunately the food was just ok and it was expensive. If you are looking for the original this one is definitely not like it. We prefer Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"Really overpriced.  We paid $50 for a sandwich, a half sandwich and a bowl of soup, and two fountain drinks.  Service was disappointing.  Two different servers took our drink orders but they never brought them.  We had to ask for them again after our food arrived."}
{"text":"If you are going to call yourself a \"deli\" and charge at a premium, you need to: A)  Not open with an untrained and negative staff...even if it is only one or two people. B)  The customer is paying to keep you open...listen to what they want and not what you want them to have...in other words, unless it is illegal, go positive and work to find solutions...not that tough...it's in most business school courses. C)  BAGELS should be soft, yet chewy...they give a little...makes it worth eating...yours not so much. D)  No need to drown the sides...let quality ingredients speak for themselves. E)  It's Vegas, get some outdoor seating with a little atmosphere.  Next time I want to trade my money for value, a great staff and atmosphere...I will walk a block down to the Leone Cafe."}
{"text":"Set prominently in the new Tivoli Village addition on Rampart Avenue in the center of Summerlin, Canter's is my favorite place for Jewish deli food in all of Las Vegas. To me, this is a satellite location of Canter's on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, although it technically is a franchise. It certainly rivals its namesake in these major areas: service, decor and innovative dishes. I admit I will always love the crankiness of the food servers at the original Canter's, but now that I am an active senior, I appreciate the friendly, young waitstaff, who go out of their way to make their customers satisfied, even if we know deli food is quite foreign to them! This eatery, I would guess, is a quarter of the size of the one in L.A., but it has a much more pleasant atmosphere. Of course it has the requisite, comfortable booths, but also has a nice assortment of tables, if you are so inclined. And you don't have to choose to either walk up to the second floor or squeeze into the tiny bathroom next to the Kibbitz Room as you have to do in L.A. My favorite decorations are the murals that are exact copies of the ones painted on the south wall of the building on Fairfax Ave. In addition, there are other memories of previous locations. Besides the mural of the Brooklyn Avenue deli, there's a nice write up of the history of Canter's on the menu. (I thought I  knew a lot about Canter's, but that the Canter brothers' first location was in New Jersey was a new fact for my collection of trivia.) Ah, the food. So what if it's not exactly the same? It's delicious. Personally I prefer corned beef to pastrami (and if I still lived in Southern California, I'd be occasionally venturing into the Latino community that surrounds Langer's for its amazing pastrami, the best reason to make that trip.) I ordered the corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup, which unlike its L.A. counterpart actually contains pieces of carrots, onions and celery. The bowl is twice the size I'm used to, filled with delicious broth and two nice-sized matzo balls. In addition to the amply stuffed sandwiches, you must try the Las Vegas Canter's homemade potato chips that are topped with melt-in-your-mouth perfect pastrami chunks, bleu cheese crumbles and topped with honey. Yes! It works! And don't forget to take home an assortment of yummy danish, tempting macaroons and hamentashen! Trust me, Canter's is a Vegas must-go restaurant. The sooner you try it, the happier you will be."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Ruben sandwich I've ever had! The bread was flavorful and complimented the hot pastrami perfectly! The staff was very welcoming and warm. They gave me a couple recommendations and even let me try two meats before I chose one for my sandwich. Good service goes a long way for me. So I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant and bar especially on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The staff is nice and the place is very clean! I enjoyed the food and I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I been here for the first time! And it was great food was good and would come back again! Our server Romero was great! She has a bad chill attitude and just a fun overall person who made the experience better"}
{"text":"Decided to try the new deli in town. It was busy so we decided to order to go and and sit at counter. It was very confusing ordering. Was not sure who to order from. Went to one register and was directed to different one where nobody was. Waited  until someone finally arrived. Had to ask for menu since none were available. Took 10 minutes to order 2 sandwiches & fountain drinks. When my order was ready, I only received one sandwich. Was told I ordered them separately.. I did?? Once we received our food it was tasty! Place felt unorganized & too many people behind counter not knowing what was going on."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at 8 am on a Monday morning. We were seated right away and greeted with a friendly staff.  Our food took 35 minutes to arrive.  They were not busy at all. When our food did make it, my order was completely wrong.  My omelette had cheese that I did not order and it had ham, not corn beef as ordered.  I was told I could order my hashbrowns crispy, but received soft country potatoes.  I pointed this out to the waitress that acknowledged she messed up.  The bill came with no adjustment. When brought to her attention, she said she would see what she could do. She told us a manger would be over.  10 minutes later we got up to leave, no manger in site. We were told a $2 adjustment was made by the waitress that messed it all up. Dissapointing, however the food was good and my husbands order was fine."}
{"text":"Love the spot....specially when u are from Cali it reminds you of the original one on fairfax...more like a lil bit of ya hometown.. Ya must try the sandwiches can't go wrong it's all fresh..."}
{"text":"Anybody that gave this place more then I star is a lier or an employee. Prices are outrageous as told by most reviews. Quality of food according to most reviews is a shonda. Jimmy Johns makes a better sandwich. Went to buffet at Rampart casino last night and had the best matza ball soup and brisket plus all you could eat and drink for $17. Canters LA in name only. I too will stick to Bagel Cafe"}
{"text":"I am going to give it 5 stars cause I want it to succeed. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was good and the pickles were insane! Try it and support it, after-all the place is legendary!"}
{"text":"Never Yelped before, but felt compelled to after the sub-par experience at Canters. I read some of the issues people had with pricing and service in other reviews, but i am a fan of deli food so i decided to give it a try anyway, big mistake. $18 for a sandwich with no sides is unacceptable (you get a thimble full of bland potato or Mac salad. One spoonful. Doesn't count). I'm more than willing to pay that much, being from Chicago and growing up eating Jewish deli sandwiches the size of my torso for that price, but Center's Las Vegas' is barely bigger than a sandwich at Arby's. Beyond that, the employees i dealt with dining in were distracted, unavailable and short. Management was nowhere to be seen and every employee seemed to be lost and/or not doing their job besides maybe one young lady at the register (seemed to be the \"to-go\" section. I should have just had it to-go in retrospect. If i was going to throw my money away, i didn't also need to deal with listless, uncaring employees while right within my view the purple-haired take out girl looked to be doing a bang up job). The food was fine, i guess, but I'm paying for service and experience when i put that much out for a (pathetic) lunch. This has been \"eating\" at me for a few days, and after talking to friends who have had similar ridiculously bad experiences, i decided to let people know. Take your business to Bagel Caf√© where the employees care and your dollar is appreciated! Saw that there's going to be a \"Canters TV/Radio show though! THAT should help lol...."}
{"text":"Great chopped chicken liver salad.  Mild flavor.     Disappointing Matzo Ball soup.   Not enough chicken flavor.  Soup too weak and bland.  Definitely will return for the chopped liver.  Suggest skip the Matzo Ball soup.    Good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this place to open. Waited a few weeks to go just to let them work out the kinks. Stopped by around 3 pm on a Saturday. Not to busy walked in and thought it was odd no menu board in deli area but okay went to hostess stand and got a menu. 3 to 4 employees standing around by hostess stand no one greeted me. Okay so looked over menu and decide on a Rueben with potato salad to go. 18.00 and change. Sat down and waited for my order. 2 people in front of me waiting also and complaining about the price and wait. My order took just about 14 minutes, got home and was first disappointed in the size of the salad, seriously it was a small container not bigger than maybe 1 ounce. Pickle was sliced and then my sandwich. I lived 3.7 miles from this location and my bread was soggy and the meat fell out when I picked it up. I ate what I could with a fork. Overall I would say it was okay, not what I had expected."}
{"text":"omgosh...where to start. service great. food well let's just say horrible. i got the pastrami sandwich with potato salad & a plate of pickles. let me just say that i am very disappointed. horrible horrible horrible. bland undercooked tasteless. you would like it to taste somewhat similar to the fairfax location. far from. it was like hot & cold. round & square. short & tall.  very disappointed. las vegas canter's get your act together...you will sink!!!"}
{"text":"Had the the pastrami sandwich and loved it. My wife ordered the pastrami Ruben and it was even better. We were seated promptly and our waitress was great! Very friendly and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Definitely a good fast-ish option on the strip. Not overly packed, good service and a healthy portion for a good price."}
{"text":"Discovered Canter's and we were waited on by Jay. An awesome man who was a pleasure to talk to. We asked for recommendations and after hearing everything was good, we ordered a pastrami sandwich, a pastrami Reuben, Dr. Brown's sodas, and of course blintzes. The pickles and such were a nice way to start our meal. Of course, we had to go to the deli and buy pastrami, glorious rye bread, and more to bring  home with us! THANK YOU for having such wonderful people and food! Truly a wonderful place to have a meal and soak up the deli atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Want a good pastrami! Go here. It sets the standard in Vegas for a classic deli stacked high style of pastrami sandwich you'd expect to find at say a Katz deli in NYC!"}
{"text":"Maybe the service took a day off but it's more looking like a badly run operation. Waitress took forever to show up, food came out missing etc. In any case, we came to eat, I guess. The pastrami was disappointing. Katz and Schwartz do way better job. Beef brisket was surprisingly decent despite its luke warmness. I don't see this place lasting another year."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try. Probably won't be going back. Ordered two sandwiches and two sodas ... $48. Reuben was good but the turkey ($16) literally was a baguette with a few turkey slices with a packet of mayo on the side. We were only two of maybe 15 people there and it took like 20 minutes to get these two sandwiches. Was hoping for more but was super disappointed. I asked for a dessert to go and the employee behind the counter took it out and handed it to me with the tongs - no plate or to-go box. Long story short...over priced, long wait, and eh-food."}
{"text":"Absolutely not!  We were in Las Vegas and thrilled to find a Canter's there. The food was awful. The Matzo Ball soup was water with tiny bits of carrot and celery floating about. The service was dreadful.  This franchise has a long way to go before it's Canter's."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the service was great and the corned beef sandwich was very tasty. We were very excited to have a Jewish deli open up in Summerlin. We all had the chicken soup with a matzoh ball. We asked for noodles and they had said they ran out, but we got the soup anyways. The chicken was super dry and tasteless. The carrots and celery were hard like they had just added them to the soup. Matzoh ball soup is a staple in a Jewish deli. They should be making a ton of it and have extra on hand including extra noodles made just in case. Both of my kids had the Mac and cheese with they seemed to like. I had a bit and seemed to be Kraft Mac and cheese..nothing special. We also ordered a piece of the 7 layer cake. It's from freed bakery and wasn't worth the price or the calories.   We were anxiously waiting the opening of Canter's since the sign went up at tivoli. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch!  Having said that, I'm totally unimpressed with this restaurant!  At the end of the Linc walkway, and fairly new, I thought I should try it out since I'm a lover of good Reubens!  This was anything but good.  First,  it took forever to get waited on, then an eternity for the food to arrive and when it did it wasn't and didn't look appetizing.  The cheese was cold and just sitting on top, it was small (for the price).  I sent it back to have it prepared properly, all they did was flip it over and nuke it.   These guys need to take lessons from the deli at New York, New York and the Mirage.  Now those are sandwiches with style and flavor.  In addition, I ordered the coleslaw. I could have eaten a wedge of cabbage and it would have tasted better.  Much better.  That definitely wasn't coleslaw!    It will never be on my list of eateries!  Canter's -- you need to step up your game!  Your waiter at the front had the personality of wilted cabbage.  A smile goes along way!"}
{"text":"Go here for the pastrami and latkes, those are 5 stars.   Grayish Black matzo soup I'd give -5stars. It would make any Jewish grandmother turn in her grave it's such a disaster.  Server jay 0 stars. He single handled will be the reason my girlfriend and I will not be returning to this location. Guy has no idea how to talk to people and his server 101 knowledge is a joke. Messing up basic orders and not asking follow up questions.  No attentiveness and where are the refills? You got a party of 7 that can make you're whole night and you're paying more attention to 2top? Get your priorities in order."}
{"text":"Great service! And fantastic food as always! Frequent goer of the the OG Canter's in LA, they've created a little slice of Jewish Deli Heaven in Sin City. As always the brisket is a must have!"}
{"text":"Great delicious food (Oishi).  The best pastrami ever.  Cool place. Friendly staff. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be better given the years of build-up but the current 2.5 star rating is a pretty accurate assessment.  There is a serious lacking of good delis in Las Vegas. I lived in Los Angeles for my last 30+ years, so I am qualified to know what a legit deli is when I tell you that Canter's is not one of them. We walked in tonight and were seated right away. The restaurant was completely dead with just four other people here besides us. I ordered 1/2 a pastrami reuben with matzo ball soup. The soup was practically flavorless and had no chicken in it; I think it was a vegetable broth instead of chicken? Bizarre. Although their menu lists a \"soup of the day\" our waitress informed us they've never had one. How nice. The sandwich was definitely on the small side compared to what I would expect from a $18 sandwich elsewhere. While the sandwich tasted fine, it was certainly nothing special and would be a sorry excuse for a good deli sandwich in LA or NYC.  The service was definitely lacking and this is kind of shocking since we were basically the only people dining here. Our drinks sat empty for more than half the time we spent there. Before we were done eating, the waitress offers us dessert and when we declined she immediately brings the check and comes back in 60 seconds to see if we'd paid her yet. When she recognized we hadn't, she drops it back on the table at which point we were invisible for the next 30 minutes. Just because you're in a hurry to get us out of there doesn't mean service ends. I don't know how long Canter's has on their lease, but given my experience doesn't seem to be isolated and the place being a ghost town, I can't expect this to last very long."}
{"text":"This is a real deal nyc deli but a lot better!  Friendly staff and service every visit.  The pastrami and brisket are as good as any I've had in nyc or anywhere for that matter.  Best Latkes ever.  Tried breakfast for the first time and the menu had such great choices it was hard to order so we even took a few things to go.  Highly recommend this place to anyone and the bakery items are made in house and delicious."}
{"text":"OMG! Great food, love it here! Wait staff excellent and super helpful. Prepare to be confronted with scary good desserts..,"}
{"text":"Came specifically to try the pastrami which we had in a Reuben. It was fabulous. The meat was tender and very flavorful. Next time I will go with a pastrami straight up. The second half will still travel home and it is worth it. Our service was commendable and well timed. The coffee after our meal was fresh and seriously good. Overall our experience was outstanding we will return sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is next level with their pastrami and turkey. It's freshly warm and hand sliced to perfection. Also try the matzah ball soup and latkes! And the manager Jason is very easy on the eyes!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for months. Especially because I've heard such good things about the CA location. But man, this place is SO expensive!!!! $18.50 for a turkey sandwich, $8 for a cup of soup...  We ended up leaving without ordering and went to Leone Cafe instead (which is our go-to)."}
{"text":"After a few days to consider what I originally judged as just a mediocre experience at Canter's Tivoli, I'm now angry at being severely over-charged for an inferior product there. Today I bought essentially the same order at the Bagel Cafe and paid nearly fifteen dollars less for a far superior product. Canter's sells this weird, very un-deli like, thick cut dry corned beef for twenty nine dollars per pound. Today I got a pound of excellent thin sliced, familiar, 100% deli corned beef for eighteen dollars and change. Canter's pickles were soft and soggy, Bagel Caf√©'s were crisp and fresh. Canter's cole slaw smelled and tasted bad - bad enough to go right into the trash. Bagel Caf√© slaw was fresh and tangy.   The Canter's order cost fifty two dollars and change, vs. Bagel Caf√© at thirty eight dollars. Both times I've been in Canter's thy have been virtually devoid of customers while there's always a wait at Bagel caf√©, never a good sign. In fact, the day I was OVER-CHARGED BY A MILE the employees literally had nothing to do until I gave my order. I have NEVER seen a deli like this. The corned beef was wrapped loosely in just a piece of paper that had spilled in the bag on the drive home, and I could have made jelly out of the terrible pickles. I don't usually leave negative reviews but I was hugely disappointed with Canter's and people need to know, based on an honest review. When I heard they were coming to Vegas I was really looking forward to it based on my positive experiences at their Los Angeles location. If I could give these guys zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Went Monday night around 6. Place was pretty quiet but there is not a lot of places open around  the deli yet. Food was a little pricey for off the strip Las Vegas, but amazing. I am a native New Yorker and have eaten in all of the big delis from Katz's to Carnegie to 2nd Ave Deli. The food here is just as good as any of them. We wanted to try a bunch of stuff so I ordered a hot dog with sauerkraut and spicy mustard and knish while my wife had the matzo ball soup and pastrami sandwich. The hot dog bun was slightly toasted, while the hot dog was crisp and delicious. The knish was slightly crispy on the outside yet warm and soft inside with that great knish flavor. The pastrami was excellent, Just enough fat to keep the great taste but not overly fat and greasy. My only criticism would be the broth of the soup. While the matzo ball and veggies in the soup were both excellent the broth was slightly bland and  there was no actual chicken in the soup. We also got 2 mini black and white cookies for desert just for checking in on Yelp that were also very tasty  Lastly I can't speak for all the serving staff but our waitress Romeo, yes a female Romeo, was awesome. Attentive but not overbearing, with a little sass thrown in for fun. Perfect for good NY deli food.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"So here is the thing the corner beef and pastrami are excellent.  High quality, juicy and very tender.  But everything else falls flat. The rye bread it's served on is fine but lacks much real taste.  Service is just terrible.  No one seems to have much idea what is going on and kitchen can be very slow.  Prices are way too high. Maybe for the strip location they will work but this is supposed to be a locals place.  And while I might occasionally pay 20 bucks for a pastrami sandwich, what is in a potato kinish that justifies a 10 dollar price.  You are looking at $70 for lunch for two with tax and tip.  Menu is very limited.  No real breakfast like options.  Bakery items in case looked unappealing.  It's the kind of place I might grab takeout from once in a while but they need to step up their game here."}
{"text":"I went to Canter's mid-way between lunch & dinner times.  The dining room was empty.  I went to the counter and ordered a hot pastrami sandwich to go.  I asked what bread options were available.  The clerk said, rye or bagel.  I asked if there were any other choices and she said, yes.  So I asked what they were and she said, rye or bagel!  I said, I'll take rye.  She asked if I wanted fries with my sandwich and I said, no, I don't want anything else.  She then asked if I'd like potato salad.  Annoyed, I said, I told you I didn't want anything else.  She then rang up the sale and the cost appeared too low to me, so I questioned her about it.  She said I ordered a half sandwich and the price was correct.  I said I never mentioned wanting a half sandwich, so she cancelled the credit card slip and rang the sale up again.  This time the price was correct.  I asked to have the sandwich cut in half, provide a half-sour tomato with the pickles, and ketchup.  I hate employees that do not pay attention to what you're telling them!  When I got home a short while later, I found the pastrami was cold and rubbery, not like the tender, melt-in-your-mouth pastrami I grew up with at the Kosher delis in Brooklyn, NY and still served at the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage Casino."}
{"text":"Nothing special definitely not east coast deli Potato pancakes looked and tasted like they came out of a box. No flavor flav MatzoBall soup tasteless Pastrami was good but cold. Really expected for the price a good size sandwich not a snack   Still as the lack of deli in town (Bagel Cafe really has gone downhill) and I don't consider Jason's as true deli I guess we will still give it a try maybe next time breakfast"}
{"text":"Just  ate at Canters hot pastrami on rye.  OH! MY! GOD!!!!! THE BEST PASTRAMI I've ever experienced in my life .seriously amazing so tender melts in your  mouth life changing sandwich ,potato cakes awesome that's all I ate there but will return  for  another  feeding  the brisket  and corned beef also look amazing  It's already  hands down  my goto for  pastrami"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this restaurant opening having eaten at the one in LA.  What a disappointment!!!!!!  My son and I went for dinner last night.  I ordered the chicken soup which was a bowl of broth with MASSIVE quantities of huge pieces of carrots and celery with very minimal chicken.  I exchanged it for matzah ball soup and it appeared that they brought the same bowl back with a matzah ball in it.  My son ordered the prime rib sandwich.  It wasn't freshly sliced prime rib as we expected (especially for $14.50).  It appeared to have been boiled in water all day.  When it came out it had tons of fat that had not been trimmed and had to be picked out.  The worst was that it appeared almost gray in color.  Nothing like what freshly sliced prime rib would have looked like and absolutely no flavor.  My son didn't even finish it.  Well....we thought we would try dessert.  My son ordered a piece of chocolate cake and we also ordered one to go.  The cake was delicious.  However, when we got the bill we were overcharged.  When we asked the server, he brought back the menu and kept pointing at the chocolate cheesecake price.  We kept showing him the cake (that my son was then eating) and telling him we got cake, not cheesecake.  When it was clear this would not be resolved with the server, we asked for a manager, who fixed it.  My thought was that after all this nonsense - it would have been a nice gesture if she had comped the cake....but no, we paid full price for everything.  $48.65 (including tip) for a horrible dinner.  When I think of the hours it takes to earn $48.65, it makes me mad that I wasted it at Canter's.  Horrible experience and no reason to ever go back again.  As a side note, I agree with the other commenters about the large number of staff standing around.  Ridiculous with so many people available we still had to actively seek drink refills for our water."}
{"text":"Good matzah ball soup!  Loved the complimentary pickles.  Hope this place sticks around. Can't go wrong with a Jewish deli!"}
{"text":"The best pastrami in Las Vegas!!! Hand-cut and comparable to Langer's and Katz's!!! Matzo ball soup and latkes are fantastic as well!!!"}
{"text":"What a disgrace.   Folks, we're talking unbelievably bad.   Like many, I'm a fan of \"real\" Canter's - the one on Fairfax.   Ate here, at \"fake Canter's\" with my parents last night.   In no particular order, here are the ways this abomination trashed the hallowed legacy of \"real\" Canter's in L.A.  (1) Upon ordering, we were told they were out of rye bread. At a Jewish deli. (What?!)  (2) We made the server check, he said they would make more rye bread but it would be a 15 minute wait.   (3) The rye certainly wasn't worth the wait. A pale, disappointing, soggy kind of yuck.   (4) I would venture a guess that the \"pickle\" served saw 45 seconds of brine. FAIL.  (5) Joke of a menu. NOT what you would expect with the Canter's name on it. What sort of Jewish deli has no tongue?  (6) With the \"abridged\" menu, you'd expect there would be less to learn. My sandwich featured badly burnt pastrami. Upon mentioning to our server, was told, \"that's what pastrami is supposed to look like.\"  (Wrong!)   I am not sure how a legendary deli allowed their name to be dragged through a sewer like this, but I'd sooner buy Carl Buddig for 99 cents and drape it over Wonder bread with fake mustard than eat here at \"Canter's.\""}
{"text":"We ate at Canter's two nights after it opened.  The restaurant itself is inviting - loved the murals and the neon lit sign!  Our server, Romeo, was very pleasant.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich and while the corned beef had a good taste, it would have been a lot better had it been thinly sliced.  The rye bread was small and fell apart when you ate the sandwich.  I understand that they bake their own bread, but I think they should buy it at Great Buns as it has the best rye in town.  Different rye bread, thinly sliced meats - now you're talking!!"}
{"text":"Great service & amazing pastrami! They have a full service dinner. Great taste everyone at my table tried a sample of the Pastrami and said it was amazing. You cannot go wrong w the Pastrami sandwich! Breakfast is served as well and well $ is very affordable for a strip location. Don't pass this place up we liked it better then the food we ate prev days at The Yard House, Virgils BBQ. This was by far the best in the Linq. Again don't sleep on this place it's amazing"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of the new Canter's in Tivoli Village like so many of my neighbors. I was craving a bowl of chicken soup and felt so lucky that Canter's had just opened near me. I called to place an order to go and was informed that I needed to go in person to place such an order. So even though I was under the weather I ventured over only to discover that they didn't have any chicken soup. Couldn't the lady on the phone have told me that?  I looked for something else on the menu that appealed to me that they had available (limited menu apparently) and I selected a chopped salad with chicken for $12.95. The menu listed ingredients including chicken even though under the listing it said \"added chicken $14.95\". I asked the cashier for the chicken on my salad and she informed me that I didn't need to pay the extra $2.00 unless I wanted an extra helping of chicken. I said \"Thanks, but a standard portion would be fine\" I paid for it and waited a pretty long time until it was ready. As I was waiting I was asked by the numerous help staff if I needed anything. I said that I was just waiting for my order and one of the ladies went to the kitchen to expedite the process. I got my bag, went home, opened it and Surprise! No chicken. Not only was there not any chicken on my \"salad\" but it consisted of a soggy premixed variety of lettuces and very few other vegetables or goodies added to it. I don't normally do this but I called to complain about my  experience. The staff graciously offered me my money back and asked me for my receipt number. I gave it to them last week and I still do not see a refund posted to my credit card. I don't think I will be back until they get the kinks worked out. I hope that will be soon.   I am very pleased to say that I have returned to Canter's on 2 separate ocrecently and had much improved experiences.   The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches were very good.  The only drawback was with the bread that I do not feel is dense enough or the crust hard enough to qualify as an excellent sandwich. The wait staff was excellent and really aim to please giving my sister an opportunity to taste the chopped liver from a small sample size ramekin.  I still have not tried the chicken soup but I understand that it is on the menu now. I will definitely be back. Last few experiences were great! Excellent wait staff"}
{"text":"I wish there were separate stars for service and food because I'm caught between five stars for the food and two stars for the service.  First the food: two friends and I had lunch there yesterday. I ordered a cup of chicken soup with a matzoh ball on the side, and The Rachel which is a pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese and coleslaw on rye bread. Both the soup, which was thick with vegetables and chicken, ( The restaurant does not serve noodles with chicken soup... What?)  the  matzoh ball and the pastrami sandwich were nothing short of excellent. Very fresh bread, and delicious roasted pastrami piled high. My friend had a Franklyn  sandwich, which is a beef brisket on a French roll. He wasn't particularly happy with it but that was a matter of taste. His wife had three cheese blintzes, which  she said were very good,  however there was no sauce served with it so she sent it back for sauce and they unrolled  the blintzes and put the sauce inside. Very strange but she did like it.   OK let's talk about service: it was obvious from the beginning that the two women that waited on us had never done this before. They were completely confused with simple instructions and the order was pretty messed up.  Don's sandwich came with french fries, So the fries were brought out to the table a full 10 minutes before his sandwich. My soup and sandwich came out together, but I asked that half of the sandwich be put in a takeout container with the bread on the side of the sandwich so as not to become soggy on the way home. Half of my sandwich was served with pickles (absolutely delicious pickles) on a plate, The other half of the sandwich was also served on a plate. Did they want me to take the plate home with me? I had to explain for the third time that I wanted the pastrami separate from the bread in a takeout container. It took two other people to get it right.  My friends blintzes never showed up and we waited several minutes before asking what happened to the blintzes. Apparently they were never put on the order check even though she clearly ordered them. Twice they were told separate checks, one for the couple, and one for me. The check came out with all of the food on one bill.   This place has been open almost 2 weeks and by now they should know what they're doing but they were totally confused by simple instructions as I said. This can be rectified, they just need more training.  The kitchen needs to know how to put an order together and that too can be rectified. But I will repeat just so it's understood, the pastrami sandwich, the pickles, the potato salad that comes with it, the outstanding chicken soup, the french fries and the blintzes are over-the-top excellent. So if you can put up with crazy service I strongly suggest you try Canter's Deli.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent corned beef. Thick cuts with no fat. Nice location in Vegas. They have two locations. One on the strip. Good service and menu options."}
{"text":"I've been waiting what seems like forever for the Deli to open since the signage has been on the building for quite some time.  Well I finally made it in for lunch and the bottom line = About double the price of what it should be.  Had the signature pastrami sandwich and was at first taken back by the price of $17.  Well I thought, maybe the portion would be huge and would explain why its not around $10. Well, it was actually smaller than a normal sandwich.  The pastrami meat was tasty, but so over priced for the portion it was crazy.  I had lunch with a buddy and we had two sandwiches with ice tea and it was $50!  Little crazy in my book for lunch of a deli sandwich. Its a one and done for me unfortunately."}
{"text":"Canter's was fantastic.  The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful.  Happy Hanukkah from Congregation P'nai Tikvah!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting for Canter's deli to open so I could try their sandwiches. I happened to be in the area the other day so I stopped. I was waited on enemy I came in the door and seated. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and a water. Service was good, water came right away and sandwich soon after. First think I noticed was how small the sandwich was compared to other deli's I have been to. The meat was moist and tender with good flavor. Came with a pickle, two sliced green tomatoes and I got potato salad. All in all it was not half bad till I got the bill. $18.35 w/tax just for a pastrami sandwich. Thought i got the wrong bill but low and behold it was mine. Not worth the price so I guess I'll just keep going to \"Bagel Cafe\" where you can get a pastrami sandwich which is larger, same quality meat (had more than Canter's) for the total cost w/tax $14.02, so that's a $4.33 savings. With that savings I could have got a drink and still saved money."}
{"text":"Ordered chili dog and fries take out.  Cold, mediocre food that is WAY overpriced (prices more here than in LA)!  Sandwiches that are way overpriced. And  S - L - O - W  service! Another store will close to overpriced food at subpar quality."}
{"text":"It was just okay. Our server Daniela seemed like she was having a bad day and seemed moody and it was just the beginning of the day. There were maybe 3 tables there, two already had their food, so not too busy. We got our drink order - my husband ordered a coffee and water. I ordered a Diet Coke. She dropped it off and asked if he needed a spoon. He said yes and then she went to get one and put it IN his mug. What? That was weird. She couldn't place it on the table? Then she asked if we were ready to order. My husband ordered the Rachel with a side of coleslaw. I ordered a fish cod sandwich. She looked confused as to what I was ordering and I pointed to it on the menu and she looked surprised that it was on the menu. Then I ordered a side of gravy fries. She left and she forgot to give us straws. Thank goodness the little stand behind me was stocked with straws, so I had to get it myself. A few tables were being sat near us and had placed their orders. About 5 minutes later, my husband's food arrived. I was thinking mine was coming shortly behind. 10 minutes later, still no fish sandwich or gravy fries until our Server noticed that my husband was eating and I wasn't. Oh and by the way, they gave him potato salad instead of coleslaw, but whatever. The tables who were sat after us and ordered after us had their food and they were eating. Finally my food came out and the food runner did apologize for the delay and we barely saw our server. I am guessing my order was never put in. I think I was too annoyed to really enjoy the food since my husband was already done eating. My food was good, not worth the price, but it was okay. I am going to cop the bad experience to it being so new, but not impressed with the service (the server mostly; the busser, hosts, and runner were fine) . I will stick to Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"Tried the pastrami and the brisket...no joke...this food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Friday June 28th 12:30 PM   I smell amazing pastrami as I walk in!  I'm in love with their all day breakfast here.  This reminds me of a restaurant called Cozy Grill in Warwick, Rhode Island.  I went with French Toast and bacon with a water.  Boyfriend had latkes with apple sauce.  Also Bagel with cream cheese and chive.  His cup of coffee was large compared to other places, I was impressed with how good it smelled black reminds of a medium roast straight from the east coast.  This place screams east coast Jewish place, the industrial lighting and tile on the pillars adds a nice touch.  The deli is even nicer with the white marble looking quartz I assume.   My new favorite place considering it's so quiet and intimate.  All the conversation is so soft you can hear a pin drop."}
{"text":"Awesome rueben - super lean and moist! Great pickles! Super location in beautiful Tivoli Village with no smog or traffic to get here! Romeo was fantastic and sweet and made sure everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Menu is very pricey, food is ok, service is excellent. We started with a pickle plate. The pickles were delicious.  I ordered the corned beef ruben with fries and my mom ordered the pastrami/Ruben combo sandwich with fries. We both felt as if the meat on our sandwiches lacked flavor. I've had better sauerkraut from a can. The Russian dressing was good. I tasted the pastrami from my mom's sandwich and there was absolutely no flavor. Our bill came to a whopping $50 for lunch for two, at a deli!! Our server, Chris was very nice and accommodating. Overall I was underwhelmed by the food."}
{"text":"After a short wait, we were seated, gave our order and served promptly.  My smoked salmon and poached egg on an English muffin was pretty salty, but I ate the whole thing.  Mine came with mixed fruits.  Hubby ordered corned beef hash and eggs, but truth be told, he prefers canned corned beef."}
{"text":"They have a very well endowed pastrami sandwich called the Rachel.  Excellent!  BUT and there is a big BUT, it's nearly $22.00 with tax and comes with a very average pickle slice.  The service is excellent. Sandy waited on me  and she was awesome!  The cheese cake was good but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Yesterday, the Wife and I stopped by for a Pastrami sandwich for lunch. It was okay but nothing to write home about. It was beautifully carved and served, but lacked taste and tenderness. We've eaten at Canters on Fairfax in L .A numerous times over the past years but our visit here in L. V.  wasn't the same. Maybe my tastebuds are changing as I get older but one thing is certain.....I will not return."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! By far the best pastrami in Vegas :) I originally ordered it on white bread because I have never cared for rye; it has always been a little dry when I ordered it. I'm glad that Jason shamed me into ordering it on rye. It was so fresh and moist and definitely complimented the pastrami. We also ordered brisket; equally amazing; great flavor and tender. For desert we ordered the carrot cake and biscotti which, like everything else here, are made fresh daily. There were so many other items on the menu I wanted to order but didn't have any space left.  The service was great and loved the casual atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back to try out their breakfast items. If the dinner was any indication of the rest of the menu, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Canters is the place. Great food an service. You have to be from back east to know what great food is. This has it all. That pastrami is to die for. People compare bagel cafe prices to canters. Canters is way cheaper an better scenery. This place you must try"}
{"text":"The breakfast food and sandwiches here was really good! The portion sizes are huge and the price point is about right. I would love to give this establishment 5 stars because the food was good, but the server was no bueno.   Maybe she was having a bad day or overwhelmed with the number of tables assigned but she seemed annoyed and agitated. From when I placed my order to when I had to request the check after sitting for a solid 10 mins with empty plates infront of me, our interaction was unpleasant.   The table was never checked on to see how things were going the entire time, drinks weren't refilled and a plate of food I never ordered was initially delivered to the table. Fortunately, a kind gentlemen running around with food was there to correct the order and assist us with a bottle of ketchup because our server went MIA.  I would have definitely retuned this is location before departing but the server left a bad taste in my mouth. Possibly with a more pleasant server this would have been my go to spot the entire trip!!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this spot only 3 stars but I am disappointed. I waited for months to try this deli out and then gave it multiple shots because I truly wanted to like it. No dice.  Ok, I love delis but this one is struggling. The staff still doesn't know the menu for one so your order often comes out wrong. Thought it was the kitchen at first but then asked some questions and realized the truth. Waits are often longer than they should be also.  The food is decent but not very impressive. I've tried about 10 different things and the fish and chips was tops. That just shouldn't be at a deli. The turkey reuben was dry. The Rachel looked good but I got it with brisket and it was all fat. I don't even know what they could improve but this is no Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable. I guess the most memorable part of this place was when I asked our waiter if he had any bandaids that I can have due to wearing the wrong shoes (girl problems.)  BF and I were in sin city for my birthday and after searching on Yelp for suggestions, we found ourselves here. The only real complaint I have about this place is that it took our waiter some time to finally approach us for drinks. Other than that, everything went well.  I ordered the French toast with strawberries and Nutella. My boyfriend ordered the pastrami sandwich. He said he enjoyed his food. I also enjoyed my food. I mean, it's French toast..  We'll probably be back in the future and I'll give it another rating then!"}
{"text":"Canter's is a hidden gem. Top notch food and service. We even got a visit from the manager Romeo, who wanted to know if everything was great (which it was) and let us in on some dessert secrets."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while exploring the Linq promenade! Price point is a bit high, but it's Vegas and it's s true Deli! Wasn't super hungry so I just ordered the Pastrami Chips! OMFG these things are absolutely ridiculous, the chips are made fresh and coated in a honey glaze, throw on some blue cheese crumbles and some chopped pastrami, and you have a winner! So damn delicious! I also bought a loaf of rye bread, and made a sandwich with some of that pastrami and the spicy yellow mustard they have! That bread is absolutely delicious, it's thick and chewy, and has great flavor! So damn good! I highly recommend this place as the pastrami might be some of the best I have ever had! Just wish there was a bit more on those chips at almost $9.00! But damn was it delicious, just so good! Definitely stop in if your in Vegas, it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and waited about 30 minutes which was not bad considering opening day and everything. Would have been quicker if we were allowed to eat in the deli area instead of having to wait for a table. (I'm sure this will be fixed once they are not under the opening day issues) $19 for a pastrami sandwich? Where do I begin...the pastrami was very fatty and was served lukewarm, the size of the sandwich was super small and over all the taste wasn't there. Just very bland. Ordered fries as a side because apparently the only side with the sandwich was pickles which... really? That's not a side. Anywho maybe i'm being a little harsh but I have had such delicious pastrami from The Hat in CA the portions are HUGE and the price is way reasonable. Just don't get the hype. I'm sure everything will improve once the kinks have been worked out but for me its a one and done. $19 for a sandwich and it has no sides or even a drink.... I just cant wrap my head around this."}
{"text":"Arrived at Canter's Deli shorty after the peak lunch time. We were immediately seated in a comfortable booth. Table seating is also available inside and the patio.  Service was prompt and our server Sheryl followed up on a timely basis.  Lunch consisted of a cup of matzo ball soup and half pastrami sandwich and cup of chicken noodle soup and half turkey sandwich. Tasty pickle slices and green tomatoes are served with sandwiches. The menu states that all sandwiches come with a choice of cole slaw or potato salad. Our server advised us that the menu was incorrect and those choices are only for full sandwiches. Both soups were delicious with the chicken soup having an abundance of chicken. The sandwiches were served on fresh rye bread and the meats were moist and tasty.  Quality and quantity were spot on. Only the high price at Canter's determined the difference between 3 and 4 stars.  As a side note we purchased two cinnamon raisin bagels to take home. The taste of cinnamon was evident but no raisins to be found."}
{"text":"Lame. Insulting.  Just bad.   I lived a block from the Canter's on Fairfax for years and was really looking forward to this place opening. I started with a matzo ball soup. The soup was murky and salty. The matzo balls were way too soft. It was not very good at all. I also ordered a grilled corned beef reuben sandwich. The sandwich that was brought to me looked carelessly slapped together with 1000 island sauce smeared over about a third of the top. The exposed bread had no coloring and  was soft and cool to the touch. I told the waitress that it was supposed to be grilled. She agreed and the busser took the sandwich back to the kitchen. He returned immediately with the same sandwich and no change had been made. He told me that the cook said that it was grilled and that if I wanted it toasted, that is something different. This is B.S. I know what a grilled sandwich is and what one should look like. Certainly, a grilled sandwich should not be pale, cool and soft. I rejected the sandwich and asked for the manager. When the manager came, she seemed like I was just a waste of her time and she told me that she didn't have a chance to look at my sandwich and that they do things a bit different than in L.A. (Funny, the entire back wall is photos of the L.A. location.) I told her that I was pissed and my intelligence insulted that the cook would insist that what was brought to me was grilled. I've had enough grilled cheese or ruben sandwiches over that last 5 decades to know what grilled should be.    I'll never go back.  P.S. Shakespears  pub serves an excellent ruben sandwich."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and we commend the waitresses for the great job.   Food - eh.  Cole slaw was rancid and smelled.  Surely the kitchen staff could have known it was well past its prime and into the decomposing stage.   Rueben was okay - on the bland side.   The floors are very dirty and begging for a broom or mop.   Lot of potential but doesn't make it."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the NW part of town recently, and visited Canter's for brunch on Sunday 1/28/2018.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our server (I forgot his name, and I usually don't) was very courteous, and explained many things about them menu, as were were first time customers.  To start, we ordered an Everything Bagel with cream cheese; he came back shortly after and told us they were out of Everythings, so I ordered a Garlic. It was toasted like I had asked, and had and a lot of cream cheese with it. He also brought an assortment of pickles, of which I loved, but my hubs didn't care for most--his loss! Our entrees were a type of BLT with fries, and I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs and toast.  Our server was kind enough to let me sub Potato Latkes (with sour cream and applesauce, of course!) for a small upcharge of $2.00 instead of having to order them ala carte for $8.95. The female food runner brought out our food, but didn't have my toast nor the Potato Latkes; I asked about them and she returned with them a few minutes later, but without the sour cream or applesauce. I asked about those, and she went back to get them. I dislike runners delivering the food because they never know what you ordered, even if they read the ticket, which clearly this young lady did NOT.  Or at least it seems most never pay attention to the ticket, as inevitably most runners always forget something.  Our server came back and asked about everything, and I asked for the sour cream and applesauce, but did tell him a runner went to get it.  He came back with it quickly.  The runner then returned with it as well, in addition to another Garlic bagel.  The runner was a very young female (possibly a very light skinned African American, with black rimmed glasses--the only reason I describe her is she wasn't wearing a name tag), and apparently doesn't pay attention to detail, and seemed like she didn't care about her job very much.  She had a very tired look about her (as if she'd been out too late the night before). Her attitude about being there was VERY nonchalant, and seemed like she could have cared less about what she did, right or wrong, let alone making sure folks had their CORRECT orders with all the accompaniments the first time.  Our server, during the brief two times he re-visited the table after taking our order until we asked for the check, was very courteous and attentive, but seemed to have too many tables assigned to him.  My hubs enjoyed his sandwich very much.  My breakfast was very good as well.  The hash was pretty thin on the corned beef, however, being mostly potatoes and green onions as filler.  Eggs, toast, and latkes were all excellent. Saw others' sammys as I walked to the restroom, and the meats were piled high on the Rueben and Pastrami I saw, and looked delish. All in all a good visit, and we will most likely return.  I hope management reads their yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Two friends and I had heard of Canter's culinary reputation in other states so we were looking forward to our get together to try it for ourselves. We had chopped salad, an omelette, matzoh ball soup, and a corn beef sandwich on rye as our main entr√©e and none of us were disappointed. The appetizer pickles were crisp and delicious, though garlicky like a motha - and if you're into garlic, buon appetito! The Italian Ricotta cake was bomb and although I thought the 7 layer cake was a bit dry for my liking, my closest friend said it was wonderful and proceeded to devour it! Aside from the food, our server, Kelsey, was amazing! Although she is Vegas born and raised, you'd swear she was straight from Brooklyn - she was hilarious and on her game - going out of her way to make our experience positive. The experience reminded me of a throwback to Chicago's Ed Debevic's. Loved, loved, loved her! She made the visit to Canter's so fun. We will return again and wait for a table in her section. What a refreshing dining experience. When we return, it won't just be for what's on the menu, but for a heaping helping of Kelsey's A-1 service and come-back-again demeanor!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the Christmas holiday and stayed at The Linq hotel. Great spot for nightlight and partying if you don't want to travel much or be in a huge resort hotel. Cantors NY Kosher style Deli is right there outside the hotel door. It's located within the promenade outside the hotel near the High Roller. Our server was a young lady who's name is Paula. She is an absolute sweetheart. She alone gets a rating of 10+++. Very attentive and so so friendly in a real way. Nothing unpretentious about Paula. The food was delicious. Perfect. Just what we wanted and like. When in Vegas we would definitely stop by there for dinner again. Thanks Paula for making our dinner a great success. You're a huge asset to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there today. Arrived about 5:15. The place looked nice and was about 1/4 full. When I ordered the corned beef sandwich and asked for regular mustard the waiter said he'd try to find some in the back but the spicy mustard was on the table. He made it seem that it was an insult to ask for regular mustard there. It took over 20 minuets to get our soup. Only 2 of our sandwiches arrived. We were told the other was on its way but 15 minutes later no sandwich. When we asked about it the waiter seemed confused the said \"oh yeah a 1/2 sandwich but a whole one was ordered. The food was ok but nothing special. I went to the counter to get some pastrami and corned beef to take home. I asked how much per pound and was told $29.99/lb for pastrami and $28.99/lb for corned beef!!!!! Seriously???? Go to The Bagel Caf√© instead."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Customer service was terrible. I was here around 8am. ordered breakfast and coffee. i wanted to seat in and eat, waitress wasnt there. I asked the counter lady if I can seat somewhere and eat. The way she showed me outside seating area, that was rude. I went to outside seating area. There are 2 side, one side is closed another side is open . i wanted to go to the open area, one waitress came and told me its for seat in customers i cannot seat and eat here i have to go to the other side. I politely asked her to open the other sidez She went inside and did not came back. waited... and then i went inside , asked the bakery guy that could someone please open this area so that I can seat and eat? He helped and told someone else. By that it time its more than 10 minutes. Finally someone cane and opened the area. I ended up eatibg cold breakfast which wasnt fun any way..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Cute environment, waitress \"very busy\" but did replace one sandwich after she heard one of my dining companions complaining that her corned beef had absolutely no fat and she had requested fattier corned beef.  The manager solucited our feedback. We advised her the latkes were greasy and not very crisp. The matzo ball soup was ABSOLUTELY tasteless! The reuben was dry and I wouldn't have recognized it as such if I hadn't ordered one. I requested extra sauce after an initial taste but I guess our waitress was too busy. I flagged another who promptly delivered. The Dr. Browns diet cream soda was delicious...but $3.50? Our 3rd diner ordered a pastrami which she enjoyed. She also liked the cole slaw. The pickels were good, too (but I don't think as good as Clausen!).  Overall, i won't be back for a $30 lunch ($17.95 for half an overstuffed but very dry sandwich and cup of tasteless soup, 1/3 of the $10 potato latke and $3.50 Dr. Browns) served by a \"very busy\" waitress."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the LA location since I was a little girl and had eaten at Canter's in Vegas before but a different location. We were hungry after seeing a show and this was my husband's pick. I wanted to be sure as we like to try new places but even though the menu was smaller than LA, I ordered a Build your own omelette with corned beef, onions and swiss cheese with crispy hashed browns per the menu but not as crispy as I really like them. I have to say the eggs, which had the swiss cheese melted on top were really good and even though I watch my sodium, I had eaten carefully in our condo earlier in the day. I am on a gluten free diet but had to have some bites of a bagel. No pumpernickle was baked that day but the plain one was huge and toasted just right and they gave me a side of cream cheese to make up for no pumpernickle. I took a \"gluten blocker\" even though they are from vitamin stores and not everyone believes they work but those bites of bagel with the cream cheese and some eggs on bagel too were good and it was too much food so I had breakfast for the am. My husband ordered salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes. The sides were cool and it was cold inside there so we understod why people were eating outside but people line up for the observation wheel right there so we opted for indoors. Since his sides were cool but salmon hot, they must have plated sides too early. It was a thick piece of salmon and tasted really good just the way it was served but I think my husband was still hungry. He had the rest of the bagel and passed on the expensive bakery goods....didn't see Groupon Coupon and Ebates rebate till later as I don't have a smart phone yet. Glad we did a shopping at the market and 99 Cent store so husband had pound cake for dessert and got rid of his sweet tooth for the night!!!"}
{"text":"Not great service very inexperienced wait staff not crazy about hand carved  sandwiches too thick.  Should be serving breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Yes the staff can have some trouble.  Yes the prices are higher than other pastrami/Jewish deli alternatives within a 5 mile radius.  Yes the sandwich isn't as large as you see in the movies.  But in all, still a very delicious meat-inspired meal.  Moist and flavorful meat.  Fantastic edges of pastrami.  Rye bread with coleslaw and big pickles make for a perfect meal. Throw in some quintessential Dr. Brown's while you're at it. I wouldn't think you can afford Canter's food on an everyday basis, but it's very much up there in a city dying for more Jewish delis."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meats as we were not expecting much being used to NYC. The meats at Cantors were very similar if not better than at Katz's- for all former New Yorkers no more missing Kate's. Try Cantors- there is no better deli meat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great to have Canters back in LV. Grew up with Canters in LA for 24 years and the Canter family are great people.  I don't normally like visiting restaurants during opening weeks because there are a lot of kinks to work out and it's really not fair to criticize new places until they've moved pass the opening. I will say this though the pastrami was as good as the L.A. location and the recipe is on point. Same goes for the coleslaw, taste like back home.  On the other hand the Potato salad was not familiar and definitely needs to follow the L.A recipe, not sure what's going on there. Same goes for the Matzo ball soup. The soup wasn't bad, but just didn't seem to follow the Canters formula. I know certain things are hard to replicate away from the Fairfax location, but these seem to be easy fixes. So I look forward to updating my review in a few months after the opening kinks are worked out. In the mean time Vegas just got a legit LA landmark landed right in the heart of Summerlin. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let's start that I am big fan of Canter's on Fairfax. I have been known to drive 4 hour's just for the pickles. So i was excited for the las Vegas opening so I could take mom for her birthday and get her one her favorite dessert's the famous 7 layer cake. Oh wait it wasn't on the menu.  Food: The pickles were about the best part of the dinner.  My waitress gave extra that made me happy. Drinks came quickly.  We both ordered soup and 1/2 sandwich. I got Turkey that was completely dried out. Mom got corned beef again that was very dry. The matza ball soup or should I say Matza ball and vegetables. The Matza ball was so big it was good i don't think there was any soup in the bowl. But plenty of vegetables and shreded chicken but i didn't order a bowls of Matza ball and vegetables and shreded chicken.   For dessert mom wanted a piece of chocolate cake to go. $8.00 and we were told it was chocolate but when we got home it had a ring of white and powdered sugar and coconut. No one mentioned coconut.  The Bakery; what Bakery enough said.  The service was great. We were greeted thevsecond we walked in the door. The greeter made u part of the family. Our waitress was very delightful and helpfull.  In the end I wont be rushing back. I was hoping for better. Granted it was their 3rd day open. I'll give it a few weeks and check back to see if things change. 2 stars is mainly for the service"}
{"text":"The pastrami is awesome Service was great.The matzo ball soup was wonderful What else can I say?"}
{"text":"I was looking for a traditional Jewish deli and I found what I was looking for. We started off with the matzah ball soup and latkes and both were spot on. For entrees we got the turkey platter which was next level out of this world and a pastrami Ruben that was the best pastrami I've had west of the Mississippi.   I'm from east coast and miss eating this food! I honestly can't even understand any of the negative reviews, I can only assume that people just don't understand what a deli is ?"}
{"text":"What can I say but a truly righteous pastrami sandwich can be had in Sin City!  Please note that the portions are large so sharing is definitely something to consider.  We didn't which meant having to take 3 half sandwiches to our hotel room.  Thankfully we had a refrigerator so we could enjoy the leftovers the next day.  Service started out great but then we saw less and less of our server.  It's not a deal breaker but some noteworthy feedback..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and going again today. I've tried both breakfast and lunch....no complaints.  The meat is definitely high quality and the presentation is appetizing. I also like the environment. ..not loud, music playing,  etc. I can actually have a conversation without yelling trying to talk over the noise level. The service is good too. People have complained about the prices but they give you what you pay for. ..more than enough.  Las Vegas is full of very cheap people who waste money on other vices but when it comes to things that you actually need , they complain. ...very different kind of breed here...they want more for less or free is even better as long as they can get away with paying very little or nothing."}
{"text":"Bottom line. The quality of the Pastrami and the corned beef were excellent. That's what my wife and I came here for. We are from NYC originally and I am a Deli snob...ha...ha.  I just ate at Katz Deli 7 weeks ago and this was every bit as good. The Pastrami is the real McCoy. It melts in your mouth. I do not mind paying a premium for great deli meat, as I know how painstaking the process is . The rye bread was excellent also as was the potato knish. Our waiter Samuel was an excellent waiter and went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy.  I hope they do well. Its the best pastrami and corned beef in Vegas. Unfortunately there are many people that live here that will not know the difference or would rather pay less and get some prepackaged reheated garbage so they can pay $5.00 less a sandwich. I am keeping my fingers crossed and hope they get enough good press and word of mouth.                                                                              David C"}
{"text":"I work across the street from Canters, the owner actually came into our office and introduced himself and asked for us to consider them for catering for our events that we host throughout the year. Myself and my general manager went to go visit, Gave them our business cards and explained our intent. We were asked to wait for the manager to come out and speak with us. We purchased a few items and sat down and ate. The manager never came out, it was a few minutes after we finished eating that the assistant came and told us that the catering manager would contact us instead and we left. We were never contacted."}
{"text":"Ok I will admit I have been going to multiple places for a fresh not dry French Dip with real Au Jus not available in Las Vegas until now. Canter's offer a thinly sliced homemade Prime Rib sandwich with a great homemade Au Jus it tastes just as if it was out of my kitchen if I had the time to cook Prime Rib fresh and make the Au Jus. Customer Service is good especially for a brand new place."}
{"text":"Hi everyone,  I have tried every sandwich, sub and deli restaurant in town and I can honestly say they have the best pickles, Rye bread and the best Rueben sandwich. I have only been there for lunch so I haven't yet been able to experience breakfast or dinner but I hope too soon. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"who ever opened this canters does not have any clue about chicken soup or any other thing its awful and very expensive good luck hope you survive with the wealthy people cause you will not survive here in vegas . this is a locals town .hopefully the canters in los angeles takes over cause you do not have an idea what los angeles tasted."}
{"text":"We were there in November and were surprised how great it was. Best pastrami I had ever had. I am going to be back in May and will definitely be going back. I hope it has not changed. I noticed reviews are hit or miss now."}
{"text":"Located inside the LINQ Promenade. Decent quality of food and sandwiches but it was a little pricey.   My friend from LA was familiar with Canter's and said that the one in LA was cheaper and served bigger portions. It was my first time so I'm not sure what to compare it to, but to me it was good."}
{"text":"I think it was an amazing place to eat at hands down the best kosher meal that I have ever had I think the service is great the people awesome and most of all my server kerri is awesome and she always came back to check up on us to make sure I would like to add to my Yelp the girl pregnant woman honest a brunette or redhead she thinks he's in the deli on my way out I decided to grab some rolls and that girl too is amazing very polite very kind very spiritual woman being in the business of food I know it can be pretty difficult but for someone to be pregnant and working she is hands-down awesome"}
{"text":"My first trip to Canters won't be my last but if I have the same experience again, I can't say I'll be a regular. However given that the restaurant hasn't even been open 1 entire week I'm going go give them another shot in a few weeks. Here's how my Saturday lunch went at CANTERS...  ATMOSPHERE: The interior of Canters is very nice and clean, great tile work, nice floors, and nice tables. First thing you see when you walk in is the deli, the sweets and the delicious meats being carved right when you walk in make you feel you made the right decision going here. Very casual and family friendly environment. I love that they have USB ports and outlets at the deli counter. I'm impressed with the layout.  FOOD: Beware if you go for corned beef, they might not have any, I'm still perplexed to how they ran out of corned beef at noon, but so I was told.  To start I the matzo ball soup which was tasty, not bland, and the veggies were fresh, the matzo was also seasoned well. I also got some onion rings which were supposed to come with my sandwich but since it wasn't ready my waitress felt bad and brought them to me as an app. LOL Last but not least I had the brisket sandwich, it was okay, nothing special but not terrible. And after that I remembered, what about my damn coleslaw? After I reminded my waitress voila...my coleslaw came, that was actually good!  Before I left I stopped at the bakery area to grab somethin sweet (I'm just glutton for punishment) it took way to long for us to get TWO pastries, I thought I ordered another sandwich. Do get the almond croissant DO NOT get the cream puff croissant, it's filled with that fake buttercream.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: This is where things start getting choppy. As soon as we walked into Canters we were greeted, and placed on the waiting list to be seated. The wait wasn't bad, considering how busy they were we waited around 10 mins. Normally once your seated at a restaurant its smooth sailing from there, it took us over 20 mins just to get water, another 10 to get our actual drinks, and it took close to an HOUR to get our order... throughout this I had to remind our waitress for our sides. There was definitely a gap in communication to say the least. Honestly I truly couldn't enjoy my food because of the wait times, I was shocked that they were so unorganized.   Hopefully things get settled at Canters because I definitely want to go back, perhaps next time I'll order to go as the dining experience left me frustrated."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket sandwich I have had in Las Vegas bar none.  Offers a bakery, take-out and catering.  With Tivoli Village almost doubling in size it makes sense to stop and see what's new and try the excellent deli food."}
{"text":"This is so not what it could be.  Terrible service the place was empty (rightfully so as it turns out) and we waited forever for everything.  One of our party got their food right away while we waiting another 20 minutes and it wasn't hot food.  Small portions for a deli not overstuffed sandwiches at all.  The food was dry as if it was left over."}
{"text":"Great food and very knowledgeable server that took great care of us. Pastrami was on point!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible. What a disappointment. They kept delaying and delaying there opening. Why a reduced menu just delay another couple of weeks and have the same menu as the West Hollywood location. The server jerry was the only bright spot. He was fantastic other than that no kasha vashingas and no rainbow cookies. Extremely small bakery. Very very overpriced. The bagel cafe down the street is much better. I would never go back and I was really looking forward to eating kasha. They also charge 3.25 for cole slaw. Bens  in New York gives free cole slaw."}
{"text":"I always love a good New York style deli and Canter's is a phenomenal example of what a deli should be.  From the warm greeting when we arrived to the prompt and attentive service, the staff was more than accommodating.  I ordered the combination sandwich, half pastrami and half corned beef on rye with macaroni salad with a half cup of matzo ball soup.  I recommend ordering the sandwich side by side instead of mixed so you can enjoy the different flavors of the meats.  The soup was amazing, hot and delicious.  The matzo ball was firm and the bagel chips that came with it soaked up the broth in seconds.  The meats were lean and sliced thick but not too thick.  Slather some mustard on it and you are good to go.  I also ordered the cheesecake for dessert (a must!) and it was also just as amazing.  It was a little pricey but gotta pay the rent somehow! It was well worth it and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots for a true New York deli. But I came here to eat today the service was off never got refills on my water had to chase the server. Not only did I order a Sandwich with a side of fries. They brought my fries out frost and waited till I finished them to get my food. Then the messed up my sandwich which only took like 30 min to fix. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"The food was over priced and was served to us cold.  There were three items we asked for that were on the menu.  Our toast came out and we had to send it back to be toasted.  We had a horrible experience and will not be back."}
{"text":"Service was terrible - way overpriced, have been to the original as well as the one in Reno and this food was very disappointing after having visited those two locations . $20 for a sandwich that doesn't even come with a side . I couldn't wait for it to open in Vegas . Sadly I will never be back. Got my sandwich wrong twice then brought 2 sides of potato salads when I ordered fries ."}
{"text":"Came for my husband's birthday because he was craving a good pastrami sandwich. Boy did we find it! Stacked high and nice and lean. The bread was grilled fresh rye bread. Pickles were terrific - especially the pickled green tomatoes. Contrary to another reviewer, I loved (loved!) the potato salad. It is a very mild style not made with mayo - I think maybe sour cream? Anyway, it was really different and good. The cole slaw was great, too. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I normally try not to let service significantly affect my reviews but the entire ordering process, customer service, and wrong order really affected it. If you see my reviews, it is not hard to get a good review out of me.   The deli staff did not know the menu when I ordered an appetizer and pastrami sandwich. They had to go consult with someone in the back. When a woman rang up my order, she left off the sandwich and had to ring me up a second time. I checked in on yelp and was supposed to get the black and whites. She yelled in the back to bring black and whites. The order took about 15 mins to get, and I was handed two bags to go. When I got home, the black and whites were not in my bag. I would say the nature of verbal exchanges with any of the staff members were never hospitable or friendly, just a monotone, unexcitable conversation.   For almost $30 for an appetizer, sandwich, and soda, I was hoping the experience would be better. Good thing their pastrami is bomb because I'd be tempted to give it two stars."}
{"text":"After all the months of waiting, this Canter's is a disappointment.  Don't go if you're expecting a menu similar to the Fairfax Canter's we know and love.  Bakery case was unappealing and sparse.  The matzah ball soup, a Canter's favorite, is not the Fairfax soup.  No adding rice or kreplach, and no getting just the broth with no chicken pieces, which is something that made Canter's stand out from other delis.  Kitchen was backed up and the server was too busy to take our order, so the runner attempted to take our order but didn't know the answer to any menu questions we had.  The only plus is it's clean.  Hopefully they make appropriate changes before their official grand opening.  Otherwise, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed in the food. After all the delays and waiting, we were excited to give them a try. I wanted to order the Reuben, but was told they were out of corned beef. How can you be Canter's and out of corned beef?  So my wife and I redirected and thought we'd try a variety of things. Here's how it turned out.  The chili dog was meh! The bun was hard and crusty with bland chili flavor.   The meatloaf looked and tasted more like Alpo than meat. The gravy was bland. The mash potatoes were the only bright spot on that plate.   The latkes were very greasy and unseasoned.   The matza balls were good but they came in vegetable broth. You had to order the chicken broth if you don't want it that way??  We did order it that way but they still sent the wrong broth. But that did give us a chance to try both broths. The vegetable broth was better than the chicken and the vegetable broth tasted like it came from a grocery store box.   Then we tried the carrot cake and cheese cake. The carrot cake was decent but the cheese cake tasted more like cheese cake pudding that Jello would sell. I'd be embarrassed to serve that to anyone.  It's a real bummer to have to give such a bad review as we were hoping to have another good restaurant in Summerlin. This didn't do it at all. They barely even phoned it in. Just living off the name. The one bright spot was our server was great!  Can't blame her for the food. It was so bad I won't even come back again to try the corned beef. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Skip for now. This place is not ready yet. We ordered 4 items, 2 were wrong and the wait time was outlandish and even the time it took to place the to go order was a little ridiculous. We ordered two toasted bagels, one with cream cheese, an egg, bacon & cheese sandwich (the bacon was paid for but left off) and an iced coffee...listed on the menu as \"sweet, creamy, and cold\" they took a pot of black coffee and poured it over ice and told me to add my own half & half and sugar if I wanted it \"sweet & creamy\". Ummm okay. I threw it away. All in all this place owes me $7 and 30 minutes of my life back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our breakfast at Canter's,we had the nova salmon with cream cheese, capers and bagels. Everything was fresh and delicious! Really good coffee too! Lisa, our server was excellent and had a wonderful personality!"}
{"text":"Clean place, good variety on menu and the food was fresh. They said all bagels and pastries are made here. Great place in a great area."}
{"text":"Seriously.  This place is not even in the same city as Cantor's let alone the same quality.  When I asked for my every time deli meal of scrambled eggs with onion and nova I was told they do not serve eggs after 11am.  I really thought she was kidding because who could take a deli seriously that does not serve eggs?    I had to settle for a nova on a bagel.  The nova was ridiculous and I could not chew the bagel. The others dining with me also had poor food experiences and describing them here would be like piling on   Pretty much every deli I have ever been in, food is prominently displayed with aging salamis hanging over the counter  and glass cases full of mouth watering delights. But not here. The d√©cor actually hides all the food.    I would advise anyone who needs eggs after 11 or real deli food to try Bagelmania or Bagel Cafe.  This place should be renamed \"clueless deli\""}
{"text":"This was my 3rd dining experience, but probably my worst and last. Restaurant was empty and server was far from friendly and accommodating! Never received a refill on beverage, I had to ask. She was tipped over 20% of bill in cash. I then had to ask another server for a to-go cup, and do you think she'd top off my drink? Nope. This place already has changed their opening hours, indicative of slow traffic. With poor service, it's surely not going to last long."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Very pricey.  Paid $16.95 for a pastrami sandwich.  At other similar restaurants (Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli) you get sliced pastrami piled HIGH.  This was thick cut pastrami and not very much.  It tasted fine but for the price I paid I expected a larger sandwich.  At an average diner you can get the same sized sandwich for about $8 - $10.  I was originally going to order breakfast, but breakfast prices were also high.  Thought I'd get more bang from my buck with a sandwich.  I was wrong.   I guess I had higher expectations since they were touting themselves as a real Deli. This was a big disappointment. I probably won't be going back.  Maybe the rent at Tivoli is high and they need to charge more.  But my guess, like other restaurants that have been at Tivoli, Canter's is not going to remain in business long.  It was not very busy.  Later I walked by Leone Cafe just a few doors down and it was packed."}
{"text":"So I purchased a meal at Canters on 9/29. The menu reads  pastrami sandwich lightly toasted mustard and cheese with a pickle ... $18.95. Management at canters had offered a 10% for employees at Tivoli so when i go to pay my total for my meal and a drink was $26.47. I advised them I work at Tivoli and they said sorry those discounts are not being placed at the time. I said it was fine and moved on. When i get to my workplace to sit and eat i looked at my receipt and noticed the charged me $2.50 for the pickle. I unwrap my sandwich and its just a cold piece of bread meat no cheese no mustard. I was very disappointed given the amount i was charged and over charged (pickle). I called management and was asked to walk there again to discuss the matter. When i get there management took about 5 minuted to see me. Then when i told them I had called and explained the situation they said they had no idea who i was or what i was talking about. Manager (Julia) said to give her a second walked away for about 10 to 15 minutes came back and said she was sorry but wanted to take care of this for me and took my number and said she was reimbursing my meal. She promised a follow up call. It is now Thursday 10/5 NO reimbursement in my account AND no phone call. This place is horrible. Extremely disappointed and as of today when our office is asked what places to recommend i will NOT recommend this place. Over priced doesn't deliver and doesn't refund customers as promised.   Here is an update... after I placed the above review, this story get much more upsetting. I called Thursday 10/5 spoke to the \"GM\" Katrina and told her the situation she insisted she needed the receipt... I told her I didn't have it because Julia kept it. All I wanted was to get my money back for the horrible service and troubling time. She took all my information down promised to talk to Julia because she might have kept it in her \"purse or something\" (why would it be in her purse) At this point, im truly upset but u take her word and believe she will call me back as promised once she talks to Julia who comes in at 3. I heard all the excuses but I figure shes the GM she will handle it accordingly.  Monday 10/9 5:18 im upset no call back as of yet no refund or anything. I ask to speak to a manager again... I get Joann. I explained to her the situation... again I get the same BS and ear full about being new getting it together sorry but she says and I quote \" I am a woman of my word I am writing all this down as we speak and I an getting my GM involved and she will get this taken care of for you.\" So i ask \"are you talking about the same GM who I talked to last Thursday who as of yet has not returned my call\"... she says \"No, since then we have a new GM\" I said \"so you are telling me the GM i talked to has been replaced since then\" she said she was making sure this was handled and promised a call back the next business day even if it took her coming in on her day off (Tuesday, next day)   Today is Wednesday 10/11 I called again since no one called me ... as promised again... Katrina answered the phone (wait per Joann she was let go) she said she knew who i was and what i was calling about... she said at this point there is nothing they could do since it had been more than 24 hours since the incident. So I told her its been more than 24 hours because Every Single \"Manager\" has dropped the ball. I promised a refund the day of and no one did as promised. How is this my fault how is this my problem. I am baffled. She requested my information again and I told her for what I gave that to all over you several times. She raised her voice and said \" are you going to give me the information or not\" i gave it to her but at this point in escalating the issue.   Customers, please understand this is not about $27.00. This is about the principle. This is about this company over charged me for something that was included in the meal, is that stealing?  Lastly this is about poor poor poor customer service and over charged meals. I beg anyone to think twice before stepping foot in here. I am disappointed and honestly feel taken advantage of. Managers regardless of whatever never called me back. They ignored me and that is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Our server Romeo was very good. The quality of the food was hit and miss. The matzo balls were good but the broth was tasteless and loaded with too much salt.  Stale crackers came with the soup versus bagel chips or rye bread like most other delis. Slightly marinated cucumbers are offered as pickles.  I had a pastrami sandwich. The meat was of excellent quality. For the price, $26 for a bowl of matzo ball soup and sandwich, everything should have been excellent.  There are many other NY delis in Vegas. Most are better quality and less expensive.    I decided to give Canter's another try after my first trip reviewed above and update my review. The only reason I gave them three stars in my initial review was because the server really tried hard. They actually deserved a lot less. I am happy to say that in the three months since my first visit they improved dramatically. Night and day difference. Our server Daniel was excellent. The very nice lady manager came over to check on things. My pastrami sandwich and matzo ball soup were both excellent. Even the cole slaw and pickles were better. I will definitely be back. The food is as good as the Los Angeles Canter's if not better.  If you are like me and had a bad experience around the time they first opened, it is definitely worth giving them another try now that they have gotten everything together."}
{"text":"I have been to Canters four times so far. It's been really good. The pastrami is excellent I can't say enough about it. The service has been very good.  I hope more people go and see for themselves that this is a real quality place.   My only real criticism is that the black and white cookies could be better. Also the potato salad is a bit bland. These faults in no way will keep me from visiting again.   Just thinking of the pastrami gets me hungry."}
{"text":"Canters deli CANT deliver. Let me first off start by saying the service was horrible from start to finish. Also The way they have the to go orders set up is horrible. You have to order first then go pay down at the end and wait for your name to be called. Took them 20-25 mins for one Cheesecake slice to go. The people who ordered 5 mins after me got their 2 slices of cheesecake before me. While waiting I also noticed the employees polishing silverware out by the dining area where I was waiting. I don't think that was appropriate they should have been in the back area doing that. Not by where people are eating and or sitting. When you first walk in they greet you and are very sweet. The server was not good. I won't say names, but he took too long for everything, we kept having to flag down other staff to get us refills, etc. he seemed lost. I know they just opened, but they have a lot more training to do. The manager should have been walking around checking on people there. By the way the staff was acting made it seem like no one was in charge watching them. They have lots of growing to do if they want good reviews. I'm big on service and how promptness and was not happy with how it all went. Also their prices are too high. For being a Jewish deli they need to re think on those prices. I think I'll stick to Bagel Cafe, where the food is good too, better service and the boss who is nice and always makes sure the people who comes to his place is happy. Sorry canters but you need to step it up."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Despite not being busy servers took forever just to get the bill out. This place is nothing like canters on Fairfax. Save you money go somewhere else"}
{"text":"No complaints on the food...service was lacking.  Family Had chocolate chip pancakes-there were 4.  We split the combo corned beef/pastrami along with a tuna on rye.   Tuna was really good.  Not too much mayo with celery and onion.  Perfect.   Corned beef and pastrami equally good.   Again it was just the service...slow and not like it was busy by any means.   When we left there were 3 servers just sitting in a booth in a corner.  Now I know why it was slow."}
{"text":"I would probably eat here more often if it didn't cost $20 a sandwich. Not only that but they try to tack on extra charges like $1.00 for lean meat even when you don't ask for it.  It's unfortunate because their pastrami is killer. So buttery and delicious and they have really good mustard"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the only boiled NY bagels Canters, finally in Vegas again. The food is fantastic with large portions, enough for 2 people. And the are the only restaurant that has the original boiled bagels and bialy's in Vegas. We can't stop going there. The Tivali village Place is a hundred times better than the one by the HIgh Roller because they have a kitchen. We originally thought that the bagel cafe was great, Canters beats them by 100 percent. We just don't leave empty because they have a wide selection of old style cakes and cookies. So When we leave we are packet with extras to eat home."}
{"text":"My brother recomenned this place based on the food he had at a canters back east. We were warmly greeted upon entry and it was all down hill from there! 45 minutes to get waters and two coffees while others waited for their coffees. An hour later the food came and the potatoes macaroni salads and coleslaw were clearly store made and tasted like nothing. The waiter ran his ass off with three tables while five other employees simply watched. The manager seemed to just watch the place burn in between fixing order mistakes. Matzo ball soups tasted like water and were cold due to them being set on another table for about ten minutes before bringing them to our table due to the waiter having to take other tables orders. We will not be back. Recommend going to another Jewish deli this one was the mcdonalds of deli's."}
{"text":"This was the worst service we had in Las Vegas and the worst I've had in the US. We were seated and sat there for 20 minutes and no one came to give us silverware or get our drink order. We then went inside to ask the hostess if a waiter be coming to get our order, and she said someone would be out shortly. Fifteen minutes later she finally came back out after seating a new party of people, and asked if anyone had come to take our drink order yet. We said no, and she left again. She then came back and took our drink order (two waters) and said to wait for her to find some paper to take our food order on. It had then been well over 30 minutes with no drinks, food, or service whatsoever. The couple next to us who had been seated before us left well before we approached the hostess asking about our server. We decided to follow their lead, and walked out. If you want to take a gamble on whether or not you will be served in under an hour, this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"I had an appointment this morning and I stopped at Canter's on the way home to try breakfast.  I did not use the Yelp check in offer because I was going to be eating enough anyway.  The server, Celia, brought me coffee quickly and I ordered the Franklyn breakfast sandwich--steamed brisket with grilled and raw onions topped with cheddar cheese and an egg on an everything bagel.  I asked for it sunny side up like the menu photo.  I also ordered breakfast potatoes which is one of their choices to accompany the sandwich.  When it came, there was a steak knife with it, and that was a good idea.  I broke the yolk, let a bit drizzle on the sandwich, and then pressed the top of the bagel into the the egg.    You get about two bites of the bagel as a sandwich and then I'd recommend you finish it open face style.  That's when the steak knife came in handy.  There was ample brisket and the sandwich was a good breakfast sandwich, something I generally would not order.  The potatoes could have been hotter.  They had red and green peppers and onions.  Celia refilled my coffee without asking and she offered more before I was done but I declined.  A good experience.  I need to go back for lunch or dinner and try some of their deli items."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ever, not really knowing what to expect or what the sandwiches were all about. But after looking at the menu it was extremely difficult to try and choose just one thing since everything sounded amazing. I ended up settling for the Rachel with roast beef and it was amazing! If that sandwich tasted that good I can only imagine what all the others are going to taste like and can't wait to try them. Other then that the staff was very nice and friendly and our waitress was very nice and vocal. Letting us know she would be right with ur, or if there was anything she could do for us. Overall a great experience and can't wait to back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"Spectacularly fantastic pastrami on rye and deliciously perfect matzoh ball soup, surpassed only by the warm and attentive service from Kerry and K. Romeo."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Well it started with the hostess Joy . Celia our food server was so amazing. Can't find servers like this anymore. Very lovable and passionate. The manager, Jo, came to our table, very super cool, friendly, and cared about her customers. If you ever want to get away for great food  with a great atmosphere and no pressure, this is the place.  Thanks to you all for a wonderful day. Happy holidays"}
{"text":"So Canter's.  I was super excited when I heard they were going to open up a location right across from my work place.  I used to live in LA and would go to the one there all the time.  I've been coming here now for about 5 months and I have to say, SUPER DISAPPOINTING!!!!!   Their service is less than ok and when they decide to pay attention, they get upset and bothered.  When they're on their game, it's pretty decent.  Today was the worst take out experience ever.  Really makes me want to rethink just how often I get food here. How do you screw up a soup that's already pre-made????   So the 1 star rating is for all that.  Now, there is a waiter there that is super attentive and when something is wrong he fixes it IMMEDIATELY!!!  His name is Eric.  Huge shout out to him.  He goes above and beyond to give great service and to ensure that your experience is great, even if it means he has to have your order remade, which he's had to do before.  Thanks Eric for being amazing.   5 Stars to you and you alone!!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to the Canter's on Fairfax, but a chance to try them again while in Vegas would have been a great treat.   But upon arrival, we found the air conditioning not running efficiently.  It was hot and uncomfortable.  We tried to get a seat outside, but they wouldn't accommodate us.  So, we went to the Yard House and watch them figure out their problem."}
{"text":"The quality here speaks for itself, the house made pickles and pickled green tomatoes the potato latke and hands-down the best corn beef Ruben I've had while living in Las Vegas! The price point is honestly meaning less when you have this type of quality and a sandwich that is elevated to where it should be!"}
{"text":"It was...OK.  Called in an order. Asked for bagels (at/around 1:30pm) to be added to the order and was told that they didn't have ANY. Settled for a pastrami reuben (Really good) and a piece of cheesecake (Really terrible).  The service was SLOW, even though there was a single customer ahead of me. The staff seemed to be more interested in standing around BSing than they were in helping customers. I did notice that the place was mostly empty when you would have thought there would have been at least a late lunch crowd.  Anyway, the prices were the same as the restaurant in LA, but the facility in Vegas is larger. Parking is abysmal and leaving the restaurant if you park out front is like navigating a maze. They do have al fresco seating...so that's a plus.  Again..it was OK.  Not great. Not terrible. Just OK."}
{"text":"So I am very detailed in my reviews and i cannot be any more upset with my experience. I went the first time because I had always wanted to go because of the name etc... So we go the first time and I thought its new here let there be some mistakes its not that big of a deal. WRONG !! Firstly... the only good thing was the really nice server SINA who is just a nice guy trying to do his job. The food was horrible we ordered the franklins the picture looked great and the food came out dry and felt like it was a day old and it took so long to come out I thought we were in miami for a minute. We still ate and went on with it. Sina was at least night. We are rewards cards member so we asked about the program and if we earn points ( apparently we do not) but the apparent Manager on duty who was extremely proud of his canters locations said \"oh you are rewards members.. you dont earn points but we give a 15% discount\". I thought that was great since the food was horrendous anyways.  I thought lets give this place another chance. The place is empty for a reason. Its overpriced horrendous quality and terrible service. So we go back ( i literally just left and i believe in second chances) My partner asks about the prime rib that is advertised on their flyer (false advertising) apparently the prime rib is not available at the linq location.. so then in my opinion i would probably take it off the flyer in the middle of our table or have it be a conversation piece. Secondly, our server didnt know anything about the menu items or whats in them or how to describe them. Thirdly, my partner wanted corned beef ( its a deli is that not something they know they are known for) They said they didnt have corned beef they sold out ( lies ive been here over a week there was no long lineup and them selling out of corned beef) This isnt even the biggest issue. My partner ordered pastrami instead. The food ONCE AGAIN was horrible it took 30 minutes for soup and sandwich to come out ? Really ? That is just bad buisness and our server didnt check on us once to say sorry the deli meat and pre made soup you ordered is taking long (insert sarcasm here).  So we were ready to go it took forever to get the bill. We mentioned we were rewards members and to get the 15% discount (because had it not been brought to our attention the first time we would not have known) They said sorry theres no discount ( we have the reciept so we are going to go back just to make sure they know that they are giving out wrong information) They didnt honour the discount the manager ESTHER is the worst manger ever YOU WOULD THINK that you would want to see how you can make your customers experience better if they are unsatisfied.  We did not try to get free items. we did not complain about the chewy gross pastrami. We did not complain that they advertised items they didnt carry. We did not complain that it took 30 minutes to get our food. We didnt even ask for the manager just the bill we wanted to get out of this place as fast as possible. Then Esther comes by ... SHE SAYS they dont do the discount my partner proceeds to tell her that we were here the other day and we got the discount from the manager which she proceeds to say \" i am the manager\" ( ok tonight you are the manager but you dont work 24/7 and if you are the manager you are not doing a good job of it) My partner states it was a male manager and he was the one who gave the discount. He also states that he just wants to leave and that we wont be back. Esther was basically didnt give a crap that we were unhappy. My partner stated he didnt want a discount and that he wanted to let her know some of the things he was unhappy with for next time. She just kept saying \"ok if you want to go go\" She had zero care in the world if we were happy or not. We live in las vegas and in toronto they had no idea that we were not just tourists and you would think if i was a tourist you would want my buisness.  Then.. as we get up to go I see Sina our server from the other night. My partner says hey do you remember us he says of course i remember you guys ( he genuinely did im kind of hard to miss) and he says remember the discount and i think the manager on that day was MIKEY ( ill be seeing him) he said yes let me go ask for you guys.. we knew that was gonna go nowhere ( not his fault) because we had already spoken to that poor excuse for a manager who just walked away from our table while we were still speaking. Esther should be ashamed of herself and if you are allowing her to be the manager in your restaurant you need to think twice. Sina took our rewards card and genuinely went back to ask and he came out poor guy stating he just got yelled at in the back by ESTHER the manager. Sina is just doing his job trying to earn a living and make the restaurant great and the manager is yelling at him for asking about the rewards points. Its really disturbing that he would get treated like that. She must have grabbed our rewards ca"}
{"text":"Love the location, plenty of staff, friendly & ready to be of service. Fries are amazing!! Pickles are delicious & crunchy! My corned beef on rye is divine.  We are foodies, this has been a treat!  Will be back to try the breakfast too!"}
{"text":"While participating in an event at Tivoli Village we decided to go in and try the food. The bagels were very good and the cream cheese that is paired with the bagel is very light and whipped. I really did enjoy it. The service was very good and the atmosphere of the store was welcoming. The restaurant was not busy at all when we visited but the glass of wine that I did order took about 10 minutes for me to get.   I did not eat real food here it was really just wine and some cheesecake, but I was happy with them both. For the $7.00 a glass that I paid for the white wine it was well worth it. The wine was crisp and had no after taste at all. This is a great little place to have a light or small meal. Or just have dessert and wine like me!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend and just got a coffee but my friend got the smoked salmon plate. The service was good an the plate of salmon came pretty fast. Nothing special about the bagel, the salmon or the cream cheese. The price were NY prices. Smoked samon with latte $26 + tip. Are we at the Wynn? I believe $30 for a small breakfast is way to much. You can find much better in town or in the same center."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was extremely unimpressed with their bagels as they didn't even put the cream cheese on the bagel and any deli I have gone to in the past has done this. Not only did they not put it on the bagel, they put the tiniest container on the side. Also do not buy a pickle, it is overpriced and I wouldn't consider it a pickle, more of a salty cucumber. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Jush is the best !!!! He helped us to order our food,made it very easy and friendly. Food was amazing. We ordered 4 plates and all of them were amazing."}
{"text":"I am eating right now at Canters Las Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed it! The knish was excellent, the latkes were delicious and the pastrami and corned beef a \"10\"!  As far as the $20 Sandwiches they are absolutely worth it and huge, so for all you cheap bellyachers go on back to your little hole in the wall sandwich shops and keep eating traife!  Tim our server was xlnt along with the rest of the staff. I have to say for being open only a few the place was running great! See y'all next time! Lee  So I'm Back and Jay is doing a great job serving! Very attentive! Latkes are greAt along with THOSE PIICKLES!"}
{"text":"Great place with some great good! We enjoyed some pastrami and matza ball soup. The deli pastries look great too. Romeo our server was super, definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place. Was super excited to have a deli/sandwich shop. They need to get more menus. They ran out and it wasn't even that busy. They need to get food out faster. Ours was not warm when it came out. You could tell it was sitting. We wanted onion rings and they ran out. It is a little unorganized. Hoping they step up the game. Pastrami was very good. No fatty which was nice !!! Loved the inside as well. Cheesecake was awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest spots. I have never eaten here before. I wish there was one in Reno!"}
{"text":"Ugh...such potential. Ugh...so bad an experience. Went twice while in town. Got the plank...first time good...second time the whitefish was microscopic. Both times they forgot the pickles. Both times they forgot the capers. Bagels are good...when their other restaurant decides to send them over. Apathetic and inexperienced wait staff. Just wanted it to be good. Its empty for a reason I this very busy alleyway. Won't last...sadly!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Tivoli! I see some people are complaining about pricing but I'm sorry quality, service and atmosphere trump pricing... oh back to the serious stuff...  Food was awesome. We came for lunch and had a  pastrami sandwich, Rueben sandwich and mazta ball soup. All authentic flavors and good portions! Judy was an excellent server providing great customer service and menu knowledge. Definitely check this place out, we will be back!"}
{"text":"So good! I'd definitely recommend this place. The corn beef sandwich was literally 3 inches thick and very fresh. The ice tea was also refreshing and our waitress was attentive and funny."}
{"text":"I've read all the bad about this Canters but decided to try it anyways. To my surprise there was a woman outside spewing her venom and attempting to direct patrons elsewhere. My message to her was Get A Life. Seriously trying to damage a business is beyond reasonable. If you don't like the service, food, quality or atmosphere Go Somewhere Else. Comparing this restaurant to New York is ridiculous. NY is Closed. Maybe because they couldn't continue there overly large and under priced sandwiches and continue to be profitable. Maybe because they were tired of the annoying patrons like the woman at the door here in Vegas. This place is not perfect by any means. They are obviously struggling to get going. Give them a break. Does everyone really want another empty space in Tivoli?"}
{"text":"Came excitedly to the grand opening, today. Left unimpressed. This was the first day, so I expected wait staff to be a bit overwhelmed. I'm not going to knock the place for it, and I'll leave the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure that may improve in the future. The food was the issue. Though the pastrami was tender and juicy, the rye bread was overly firm, bordering on stale. The $20 portion was underwhelmingly small. The pickles did not substantiate a suitable side, and I did leave still feeling hungry. I do not have a particularly large appetite. There are numerous places in town, that do the New York sandwich thing far better, for the same price. I work in this area, and will be back. I've yet to try the deli's other offerings. I'm being generous with 3 stars, in hopes that I just came on the wrong day. Let's see if things improve."}
{"text":"Great Service,. Excellent food...large portions, take a few people to finish one plate... yummmy"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. It was a decent meal for a reasonable price. The service was ok, the downside is that there aren't any restrooms at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a cool lil spot in Vegas w a good breakfast and lunch menu. The pricing is cheap for strip standards and the food is delicious and wholesome. I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Ok....so I have read a few of the reviews. Respectfully I have to disagree with a few prior post. Originally from Santa Monica and now a local here in Vegas. I got to say I miss the Canter's in Fairfax but I have had nothing but a good experience with our Canter's here on the westside. The service has been nothing short of on point. Of course the menu....in one word \"Fresh\"!"}
{"text":"very good food and great service. pastrami excellent, plus salads, matzo ball soup and potato Latkes. Definitely worth a try and will go back."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place. It's tucked on one of the side streets at Tivoli Village. It's hard to find I wish it was somewhere else.  When you first sit down they give you a complimentary tray of deli pickles and green tomatoes. It was unexpected and very nice.    Our  server Debbie was a delightful young women. She was very attentive,answered all of our questions and the service was great.   I had a corned beef sandwich that was very lean and there was no shortage of meat on the sandwich. My husband had the open face roast beef sandwich. He said it was the best one he had in ages. He is very particular about his gravy and he said it was delicious.  The portions are large and the prices were reasonable.   We will be back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful Memories Canter's Deli in Los Angeles!!! We took our son and his family for lunch Tivoli Village - Best Pastrami!!!! Best Cheesecake!!!! We had a great booth for 6 - Best service Samuel is the man!!!! All you \"haters\" need to give them a chance!!! Quick opening and sorting out the kinks...we live in California and we will always go there when visiting Las Vegas ... Wendy & Mario Mariani."}
{"text":"I can remember going to the Original on Fairfax, in Los Angeles. Let's face it folks, you can't duplicate the original atmosphere of any place that's transplanted weather it be from New York, New Orleans, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. But I do have to say these folks do a very good job of at least duplicating the quality of food served in their original location.  I was disappointed in the Du Par's in Las Vegas, and feel it lacks the quality of the Los Angeles parent, but I am not disappointed in the quality of food at Canter's.   We have been there twice now, and agree the Corn Beef is very good and lean, and the Pastrami may be the best in town. This is very good deli food, and though not as \"homie\" as Begal Cafe, I think they are a lot less cocky and try to put out a good product.   If price is an issue for you, don't bother going here. This town is full of low quality food bargains, and I'm sure you will find something that suits your taste for a bargain.   However, if you are from New York, Chicago,  Los Angeles, or any place that you remember good corn beef and pastrami, this is certainly worth spending the money for a treat you will enjoy.   Why only 4 stars? It's a long walk from the parking garage to the eatery."}
{"text":"this place has hands fown the best chicken noodle soup and pastam that i ever had..briskets bomb too"}
{"text":"First, there is no public bathroom here - so be aware of that.  I ordered steak and eggs, cottage cheese and an everything bagel.   My wife ordered scrambled eggs, country potatoes, sausage links with fruit and an everything bagel.  The steak was about 1/4\" thick and there is no way to cook a steak medium when it's that thin - so the steak shoe leather and basically tasteless.  The eggs were barely done - the part we both were excited for were the home made bagels.  They were extra mediocre at best.  My wife's dish was cold... the \"country potatoes\" with peppers were cold and soggy.   Her fruit was hard as a rock.  The cottage cheese was good.   The folks sitting next to us had their order brought out incorrectly... twice I believe.  Not a great experience and pretty disappointing.   This is my first yelp review.   I actually got the app, just because of this meal."}
{"text":"We were excited for this deli to open but we were hugely disappointed! We came in for lunch and both ordered half a sandwich , chicken soup, some onion rings and two iced tea's. The chicken soup was bland and boring and the sandwich was small and nothing exciting. Mine was supposed to have melted cheese, I had to send it back and they just threw a piece on top and brought it back. It was a 50.00 lunch for two which is outrageous for what we got. Service was mediocre and our server seemed put out. Definitely will not go back!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes till we finally asked for server to come. Food wasn't worth the wait. My girlfriend was not happy."}
{"text":"My husband was really excited about trying this place before it open, we are locals. We were seated in the patio and it took 15 min for our server to come. Once she came she was nice but made a comment she couldn't wait to get off. Which made me feel uncomfortable as my husband and I are celebrating our anniversary. When we were done the buser lady took our bill and it was lost for about 15 Min. Sketchy since it was gone for so long. The food was good but we won't come back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance and ordered some chicken soup to go they forgot the noodles and there's hardly any chicken in it so basically we paid for a overly salty broth with some carrots and celery I think I'm completely done with this place for good it makes me so sad because I love the one in LA"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment!  I'm a huge fan of the Fairfax Ave Los Angeles location, so when I saw this in the Linq restaurant area, I made a point of coming the next morning for breakfast.  The only reason I give any stars is because the food was good.  2 of the 6 items ordered never came and when I asked, the delivery guy said the server never wrote them down.  My wife's bagel arrived cooked but completely cold and without cream cheese that was ordered (so I guess it was 3 things missing!)  I was never offered a coffee refill and had to flag someone down for one refill.  The food came but the portions were like appetizer sized!  The picture posted reflects what a $14.70 (supposedly 3 egg) omelette looks like complete with wilted parsley garnish!  This place is an embarrassment to the Canter's name!   I always give 20-25% tip for good service but this visit was a mere 7% and that was generous.  For shame!"}
{"text":"The pastrami is absolutely delicious. Like seriously. Delicious.  Had the crispy chicken sandwich 2 days ago. I could only eat half at the restaurant because it's too much for me in one sitting, so I took the other half home. The chicken was still as delicious even after microwave heating.  Don't get me started on the cheesecake. Sooooooooooooo good!  I've also had the corned beef hash and eggs. I do wish that the hash ingredients weren't chopped so finely, but it was still tasty.  The staff is friendly. I lucked out with having great servers: Rich, Judy, David, Eric. One of the hosts, Roxie, greeted incomers with a big smile and even a little dance to the music that was playing over head.   As a side note, Nicholas Cage seems to really like the place as I've seen him seated at a back table everytime I've been here. I've been here 5 times to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent Pastrami sandwiches and Reubens here. The manager Edith was very kind. And the butcher Soleil can make a hell of a sandwich. I will be back again. Service was phenomenal too."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Canter's in Los Angeles and since we were staying at the Linq, my wife and I couldn't resist an opportunity to compare this one to the original.   Long story short, it's not as good as the one in L.A. due to its higher prices and smaller servings. Thankfully, the pastrami on rye tasted just as delicious as it did back home. If there's a better pastrami sandwich in Vegas, I'd love to try it.   Our waiter Jay was funny and seemed genuinely concerned with our experience. One bummer, though: the pickles that come out immediately as an appetizer in L.A. were nowhere to be found in Vegas. I asked one of the other workers for them and he forgot. When I brought it to the attention of Jay, he made sure that a plate full of them was delivered ASAP.  Although the prices were Vegas high and the portions weren't as generous as the original, the taste is still there. Don't forget to use your Yelp check-in for a free black-and-white cookie."}
{"text":"Wow, very disappointed! Management is terrible! This restaurant should not be open if they cannot figure things out! 20.00 for a SMALL Pastrami sandwich? Really? They have a huge shortage of items on their menu and then they do not know what is on their menu! The pastrami says it comes with Swiss cheese but I got nothing on the sandwich! They said it's a typo on the menu and does not come with Swiss cheese! As an LA native, I really wanted to love this place but it's not even controlled chaos in here! I would stay away from this place! Over priced and not worth the confusion! Sad! Very sad!"}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles and going to the original Canters so many times, I have to say, this is not canters! However, I have now been to canters on rampart twice and will go again. But, I would love if someone read my review and made some changes.... the omelette was an embarrassing joke! It was sooooo small. Come on, it's eggs.... I have not seen an omelette that small at any restaurant ever!!!! It is tooo pricy.... it's a deli, take it down a notch.... be competitive with bagel cafe (where I am eating breakfast right now, so it reminded me to yelp about canters). Positives.... the best pastrami from anywhere ever, including 2nd ave Deli and Katz's Deli in manhattan! The chopped liver was also WOW! Service was good.... but, restaurant was empty. I got my free black and white cookie, which was good... but fell on the floor... so I need another.... unhappy with the pastrami at bagel cafe and looking forward to my next half soup half sandwich combo at canters..."}
{"text":"Almost perfect!  My family of 4 ate here on a whim when we saw it walking down the street.¬† We ordered the open roast beef sandwhich and meatloaf sandwhich both which came with mashed potatoes and onion straws.¬† Gravy covered the potatoes and sandwhich.¬† My little one had the kids cheeseburgers with fries.  The kid's meal was plentiful and came with a drink.¬† All for $5.95.¬† Not a bad deal for Vegas Prices.¬† Being a self proclaimed cheeseburger connoisseur, my little one said the burgers were quite tasty.  I myself make a damn good roast beef sandwhich and gravy that would rival that of any gourmet restaurant, found this sandwhich to be a good substitution, meat tender along with flavorful gravy.¬† Onion straws were great.¬† The mashed potatoes had a strange after taste that made me leave them behind on an otherwise clean plate.   My wife had the meatloaf sandwich.¬† The portion was huge.¬† She enjoyed the meal immensely.¬† The cost for both the roast beef and meatloaf was $15 each.¬† Again a deal for such a large flavorful meal in Vegas.¬†¬†   I brought the mashed potatoe taste up to the waiter.¬† The waiter tried the potatoes and agreed they tasted weird and not normal, yet nothing was offered.¬† Just a free dessert would have been enough compensation for 3 diners with a portion which was inedible.¬†¬†   The service was a little slow, even though they were not busy.¬† I had to get up twice to refill my own drink.¬† But they were friendly.¬†   Overall good food decent price.  If not for the potatoes and service, it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Had my first and more then likely my last meal at Canters.  I waited so long for Canters to come to Las Vegas but the prices are ridiculous.  I had a tasty Pastrami sandwich.  Very small and very pricey at $17 plus tax and tip.  I get an awesome sandwich at Bagel Cafe that is $12 and twice as big.  Consider getting your prices more in in line with the suburbs.  I hope they make it but I don't see how.    Tivoli is NOT the Strip.  Good luck."}
{"text":"I have waited for this Deli to open for about a year, as I've been going to the LA Canters for 50 years.  We went on the day after their grand opening.  No wait and were seated right away.  The prices were outrageous!.. 18 dollars for a sandwich! Matzo ball soup just under 20 dollars!  They were OUT of Corned beef, and had to settle for pastrami.. thick cut (which my wife hated) she also did'nt care for the taste.  We both had the Matzo ball soup (way too many veggies in the broth) I had them bring to me without the garden (this the authentic way to prepare Matzo ball soup), should only consist of the Broth with a few carrots, celery, a dib of onion and the Matzo Balls. It SHOULD'NT have chunks of chicken in it too. The Matzo balls themselves were ok..still packed with some unknown herbs. But passable. The broth itself was amazing..clearly made from scratch..  I will give them another chance..hopefully with Corned beef there (and thin sliced, larger portions)   The wait staff was excellent, and very accomodating!  Canters, PLEASE get your act together! (And your prices)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and having just moved here I have been searching for a good deli. Found it. Growing up on Italian delis this was really a nice change for me. Had the Matzah Ball soup, Pastrami and some cheesecake. First things first, the cheese cake crushed it. Light and creamy just as it should be. The matzah ball soup was hot and the matzah ball was the right consistency and the Pastrami was world class. The service was also on target and the food came within 10 minutes during dinner rush. I wa ssat promptly and Jonathan was attentive and knew his menu. I had read some not so good reviews but also knew they just opened and gave it a shot since I was right down the road. I will be back."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches!  The waiter forgot to put in our order after we had already waited 20 minutes and then took another 25 minutes for the food.  The place wasn't even busy but he used the excuse that he was busy.  The sandwiches weren't even that good and they were expensive for what you are getting.  Don't even bother with this place.  There are too many places on the strip to choose from to waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"Being from California, I've never heard of this place, but we were hungry, so we stopped here for dinner.   Food was good, but big! I couldn't finish. I had the meatloaf sandwich. The others had a cheeseburger, chicken strips, and a sandwich. We took it all home, with dessert! And omg, the eclair I ate at home was fantastic. Yum!  I took off 2 stars for the service. Our waitress Kelsey (?) had a bad cold. She wasn't very attentive. We waited a long time for little things like a straw! What annoyed me the most was the workers (and our waitress) sitting in the booth next to us, talking loud, and inappropriate at times. My 2 kids had to listen to it. So yeah, not good service...   I'll be back to try out just the desserts."}
{"text":"We loved everything. Amazing pastrami. 6 year old daughter said it was the best french toast she ever had. My matzo ball soup was just what I  wanted. Baked goods look fantastic. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Maybe they had some issues before or maybe I picked the right date to come, but service was fenomenal.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.   There were two of us, so we split the latkes and a pastrami sandwich.  It was enough food for two of us. The latkes were very good.  Needed a little more of a crunch, but otherwise excellent.   The pastrami sandwich was awesome. I think the meat was a bit thick but it was moist and tender and very tasty.    Cole slaw was bland, but it was good.   I think for a deli it was excellent.   Read some of the other reviews and I feel that although the owner's reaction seems a bit strange, they have definitely changed because as I mentioned, service and food were both excellent.   The bill for two was $35.67.  Very reasonable.   I will come back.  Need to try the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff at Canter in Las Vegas! Truly a wonderful kosher deli! Take out or dine in, or better yet both! Pastrami sandwich, ask them not to toast the bread and add mustard. Meatloaf is delicious!  If we were not traveling, I would have taken some bagels home!"}
{"text":"So it's a sit down restaurant and a bakery and a deli all rolled into one, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Breakfast is served all day long.   Although this spot is well known for it's NY style deli creations, I can only vouch for breakfast tho which having ordered the veggie omelet served with country potatoes and english muffin...was yummy!  And the french toast was also fluffy delish!  It's situated near the back end of the Linq Promenade close to the High Roller."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here! I have been waiting months to try this famous deli...but when I did I ended up truly disappointed.    We waited about 30 min for a table which I didn't mind since this was a brand new place. It gave me time to look over the menu. I was split between having the hot dogs or an egg salad sandwich.  My friend was like, \"Do you really want to order hot dogs in a deli?\" I thought it would be fine because I thought it would look like a hot dog from Dirt Dog, or Buldogis. We waited quite a while for our food. I appreciated the waiter letting us know that they had to make the hotdogs again because they fell on the floor. I liked the honesty.  When my hotdogs were ready they were Chili dogs which I didn't order. They came out with the Sauerkraut dogs but they didn't look appetizing at all! The sauerkraut looked old and the hot dogs didn't look quality.  I thought it would at least look like a Nathan hotdog. I ate one  but I felt queasy after. I tried the potato salad it was sour. The pickles looked good and fresh but were too salty! I couldn't see myself eating anymore. We had to tell the waiter the truth which I really didn't want to do so my friend told him. We let him know that we couldn't eat the meal . The waiter was very cool he said , \"Don't be afraid to tell us the truth\". They were nice enough to take it off the bill. We ended up somewhere else for dinner. I wanted Canter to do well I hope this was part of them being new. I just expected better."}
{"text":"Food was authentic and satisfying, atmosphere not so much.  I had the pastrami which was generously piled on sturdy, real rye bread.  The Mrs. had eggs and house made corned beef hash.  Both of us enjoyed our picks.  The servers could use a swift kick in the ass to move a little faster in a relatively empty place, but at least everyone was polite."}
{"text":"Wow! Real bagels with great taste. The portions are really good here. The service can use some help but they just opened. They have a small bakery in front with a decent selection.  The pastrami was really good, it is just like the Center's in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a authentic Jewish Deli was opening in Tivoli Village, but after eating there I was very disappointed. I wanted a combo sandwich, half Pastrami, half Corned Beef. They were out of Corned Beef! Really! So I ordered a Pastrami on Rye and a Coke. The server brought my Coke, but it was a diet soda. I told the server that it was a diet drink and he promptly brought another, but it to was diet. I said I will just drink water instead and the server removed the drink from my bill. My sandwich arrived a few minutes later with Cole Slaw and 4 pickle slices. The Cole Slaw was very bland, and the pickles tasted like salted cucumbers, very little flavor. The sandwich was OK, but small for the price. The Pastrami was very lean, but a little on the dry side. The Rye bread was fresh but the slices were small. The menu was limited compared to other delis in Town. The food is over priced for what you get. The bottom line is that there are several other Delis nearby that are much better, have a more extensive menu, and better prices."}
{"text":"Amazing deli with friendly service. This was our first experience with Canter's and we really enjoyed it. The pastrami lives up to its reputation - simply delicious !  Their version of homemade pickles and picked tomatoes on the tables were a yummy touch. The potato salad was awesome; the coleslaw and mac salad were just bleh. I think if they made their mac salad in the same style as their potato salad it would be way more appetizing. Our waiter was super friendly and made us feel like valued customers. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had heard there is a good deli in the Tivoli Village. We stopped in on the way home from the airport for lunch,  and we're happy to report that it is true. I had a standard reuben while my wife had liver pat√© and onion. Both were delicious. The only drawback was the beer selection was waiting on a delivery. Plain cheesecake rounded out the lunch. All in all, very good! We stopped in again for cream puffs and canoli after dinner at another location. Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"Finally amazing deli food in Las Vegas! Great food, great pricing and great service and a taste of home. For the longest time we've been forced to go to the bagel cafe which is ehhhhhh. The corn beef and pastrami is lean and everything is made from scratch...... great spot!"}
{"text":"I lived in Los Angeles for a decade and learned to appreciate the deli options which is lacking here in Vegas. I was excited to try the new Canter's location but was quickly disappointed. Prices are typical for a deli and I thought my toddler and I could definitely share a \"sky high\" sandwich as we usually do but the amount of turkey on my sandwich was pathetic and not worth the price. There was more bread than meat and the turkey was dry. I ordered a side of fries which came to the table 10 minutes after the sandwich and was about 8 long fries. The server explained the deli counter is faster than the kitchen which caused the delay. In addition, we never got pickles and the potato salad was dry. Both my toddler and I left hungry after a $30 meal. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Their bagels are absolute perfection, we are obsessed! The meat is extra lean and the homemade rye bread is outstanding. Great addition to Tivoli Village and Summerlin area. I will visit often!"}
{"text":"I was excited about breakfast however service was slow and the food came out cold. While I was happy with the friendly staff I was not thrilled about my food."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!  Attentive staff, HUGE sandwiches, the Bagels are OMG!!!!!!!  And don't forget the Rugahala!!  You are missing out if you don't go here!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a casual brunch... She got the salmon Benedict and I got the pastrami sandwich.... We were served by sandy.... All our orders were her recommendation.... I have to say she was amazing !!!!  The food was amazing, service was even better, the bill wasn't cheap but hey.... You get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"Just Opened and if the poor service and high prices keeps up it might soon end up Just Closed.  I miss the New York delis. I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.  I knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.  Throughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.  The same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.  On its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.  .................... Reviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market."}
{"text":"Was eating a Ruben sandwich and then Kenny Loggins came on the overhead music. I remember one time when I was on the road driving my truck across the Iowa state line, and the same song played.  It took me back. It was also the song my ex wife proposed to me too, so it hits a special place in my heat. Mr.  Loggins is one hell of a songwriter and his tracks will always have a special place in mu heart. The Ruben was dry and overpriced."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE.  Not sure how these people got the legal right to use the \"Canter's\" name, but what a total insult to the original Canter's in Los Angeles.  This restaurant does not begin to compare to Canter's on Fairfax, the Bagel Cafe on Buffalo or Carnegie Deli on the Strip.    The extremely overpriced food is nothing better than average.  The pastrami is thick-cut and chewy, nothing like what traditional delis serve.  Check out the size of the sandwiches at Carnegie and Bagel Cafe.   The pickles are a joke.  Most of the sides were probably bought in bulk from Costco.  The overly forward and overly tattooed server almost ruined my appetite, as every other word he used was \"awesome\".  Who needs this?  We won't be back.  This wanna-be a Deli will close soon because they won't be able to extract enough money from so few customers to survive.  I can't wait to read the defensive, long-winded diatribe Dinah, the marketing manager, writes.  I'm sure it will include the tired 7% crap, along with the weight claims and comparisons.  Notice Dinah never defends their outrageous prices - an impossible task.  Dinah belongs in a Diner, not a Deli."}
{"text":"The original \"owner\" or his wife was there when we went. Food was delicious, but a bit pricey; of course this is typical of quality delis. Only minus 2 stars because they were missing a few things that were on the menu but they didn't have it?! Did it sell out opening day?! Was there a flood on dark chocolate cake and pastrami knish orders and ran out of supplies?! C'mon! This is a \"seasoned\" well known deli along with Carnegie and Katz.. that doesn't make sense. As for service, our waitress was great! She even had to \"school\" the cooks/preps how to make an egg cream (not on the menu) but available on request. Understandably it just opened but hopefully when we head back someday soon that'll have EVERYTHING on the menu available for order. The location is a bit hidden; would've been awesome if they bid for the place where that faux Italian restaurant is right as you enter."}
{"text":"Sandwiches although big have no flavor. Chris gave excellent service $50 for 2 bland sandwiches. Bye cantor's."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner.  Great Jewish Delicatessen menu.  Nick was our server!!  Awesome guy. Definitely will be coming here again"}
{"text":"I'll give them that they've only been open a few days, but seriously, what mess. The hubs and I went in for lunch today. There were twice as many people working there as patrons, and none of them seemed to know what job was whose. Three different people asked for our drink order, and one was completely perplexed when I said I just wanted water.   I asked for the salad plate and the server had to look over my shoulder at the menu to see what was on it. The hubs ordered half a pastrami sandwich and soup. Everything we ordered was fabulous, so clearly food is not their problem. When my plate arrived I noticed it did not have a pickle on it as stated by the menu. I asked and the server became somewhat flustered. She said she'd get me one right away. That didn't happen so I just took one off the hubs' plate. She was extra confused when she finally returned and saw me eating a pickle. I said it was fine and I didn't need the plate FULL of pickles she was holding. She took them away, brought them back, took them away again, and finally put them down and walked away.   When the check came I noticed the charge for the half sandwich and soup was $28.50. No way. I called her back over and she fixed it. It got weirder waiting in line for a black and white cookie to go, but at least the cookie was delicious. All in all we will go back, but not for a while. They definitely need time to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Finally!   ¬†    After much delay, Canter's opened at Tivoli Village in Las Vegas (Summerlin). At dinner time on a Wednesday, a surprisingly small amount of people were dining, but my waiter told me they do very well at lunch. I ordered a small serving of Chicken Noodle Matzoball Soup. A filling portion with a matzohball as good as my mother's. The soup could have been slightly less salty and there were no \"as advertised\" noodles to which the manager was very concerned. It was very good non the less. The sandwich was ordered was half pastrami, half corned beef. Both very good, as was the rye bread, no complaints. My side choice of potato salad was very good.the sampling of chopped liver was very good, though tasted too \"oniony\".¬† My waiter was very attentive and management was very concerned how my food tasted and open to suggestions. I left with a bag of bagels and a REAL cheese danish, something not readily available in Las Vegas. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Aaron and Phyllis tonight managers blew it we wanted a half of sandwich and half a soup $24 they gave it to the wrong person and then we had to wait maybe 45 minutes altogether and we said want you give us a couple macaroons and they said no what do you think about that.Lil  girl behind the register was nice and everybody else was cool amazing they want to stay in business Have to treat the customers better the two Lady marriages We live in Vegas don't think will be visiting anytime soon"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast yesterday since they claim to be an \"all day breakfast spot\". First, our waiter was either new or just didn't know what was going on. We asked very basic questions regarding refills and other things and he didn't know (fine that's water under the bridge). I ordered the corned beef hash, with scrambled eggs , hash browns and English muffin. When the food came my eggs were scrambled with a piece of American cheese on top. I switched my eggs with a friend who actually ordered scrambled with cheese and his were plain. The corned beef hash was lack luster. I can't even describe the flavor or lack thereof. The only thing good on the plate was the english muffin (which really isn't saying much being it was burnt). One of my friends ordered steak and eggs and the steak came out looking like a hockey puck and it was tough. He told the waiter and the waiter said he would have the chef make a new one...well 20 mins later and still no steak. He brought us the bill and we had to ask that the steak be wrapped up. For the inconvenience he gave us a blueberry muffin and chocolate muffin. Well this morning we were going to have our muffins and after cutting it to share it with each other, we noticed the blueberries were at the bottom of the muffin and to add insult to injury, the muffin was molded !!!   So they give us something to makeup for their faults, and what they gave us was molded....picture that!  I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Took 40 minutes to be served our food. My wifes Ruben sandwich was burned totally black. My Pastrani was also burned and tasted bitter. Help has no experience or training, took forever to get my bill and pay by credit card. They were out of bagels and corned beef. Wife & I eat out every day, but, will not be returning here. Hello Bagel Cafe !"}
{"text":"Canters Fairfax Los Angeles is my families all time favorite treat. Especially loading up on bakery goods and deli counter for a take home haul   However this location was absolutely horrible! The pastrami sandwich arrived ice cold,bread toasted  (not soft and warm) and the meat was not only cold it was thick sliced and flavorless. The Cole slaw which we look forward to heaping on our sandwiches was also flavorless and was so disappointing.   We were also disappointed to see the bakery counter was 1 case and half empty,with another bakery case completely empty no assortment of our favorite cookies and pastries to purchase and take home :(   We were sat,across from the cash register and were annoyed that the lady took our order from the register never coming to our table. When I told her I had a question about the menu she looked up and expected me to explain across the aisle...I just gave up and ordered my usual pastrami sandwich....ugh so dissatisfied with making the effort on my Vegas holiday to drive all the way out to this location for what easily was below average for a bad buffet on the strip.  Do Not Make the Effort, because this location makes no effort to replicate the true spirit and flavors of the Orginal Canters Deli.  Never again will I return to a Canters Las Vegas"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!  This place has the worst customer service!   The manager is rude and unprofessional.  She is argumentative and doesn't listen to the customer!  Our server was terrible!  He seemed so bothered when we asked for anything! You will not enjoy your dining experience"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment visiting Canter's. Bagel was served with the tiniest amount of cream cheese on the side. Any true deli puts a generous amount of cream cheese on the bagel for you. Skip this place and just go to the best deli in town, The Bagel Cafe. Also no knives were provided with our to go order to put the cream cheese on and no knives were out for convenience at the utensil station. Won't be visiting again. For the number of employees working you'd think they would do more than just throw the bagel in the bag."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick and easy dinner to take home to the family.  There were lots of employees behind the counter, but I almost walked out without ordering because nobody bothered to acknowledge.  Finally one of the employees let me know that I had to step over to the register to order.   From there my wait continued.  Of all things I was waiting on fries.  I have no idea why, but they took forever.  35 minutes after walking in, I walked out with dinner.  2 sandwiches and an order of fries.  The food was decent enough, but not nearly worth the frustration.   Personally, that was my one and only visit to Canter's.  There are plenty of other choices at Tivoli Village that place more value on customer experience."}
{"text":"Best pastrami I have ever had. Very surprised at how good it was and didn't know about this place till this afternoon. Very much worth the long drive out but it was a damn good sandwich. Desserts were really good as well. Highly recommend trying out. Our waitress Romeo was very friendly and made it a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Foods Great , employees not so much walked in no one greeted me 5 mins later , waiter never came to refill my soda , I sat there ate my food with no drink .  Asked for ranch and nothing.  Guys walking around and no one could bring me ranch took 15 mins for my ranch.  Like why have servers that just walk around for nothing ."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place, especially since I love the Canter's in Los Angeles.  But, I just couldn't.   The matzo ball soup is slightly above dish water.  The soup is really week and they try to make it look like more than it is by adding a ton of cooked carrots to it.   Adding some actual chicken to the chicken broth would help.  Even adding chicken seasoning would help.    My wife and I ate their last week and the service was really lacking.  I know they recently opened, but after several weeks, I'd expect them to have their act together, especially for the high prices they charge.  So, the best I could possibly offer is a \"meh.\"     For a real good Jewish deli, I'll go back to the Bagel Cafe, even though it's very much out of my way.  The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Horrible! A LOS ANGELES staple comes completely exploited. I've been eating at Canters since 1986 & it has never failed. Las Vegas has sucked the life out of a legend!!!"}
{"text":"I went yesterday and even though the food prices are ridiculous, the bagels were great. Went back today to get some bagels for Home. Completely different Bagel, store bought not made in house. Reminded me of a grocery store bagel. Who does that?? Real classy to offer your customers such an inferior product. By the way, yesterday when I went for breakfast they only had plain and poppy. Was told the baker can't keep up. Never will go back again. This place was not ready to open, and now they have lost me, and it looks like a bunch of others from ever going back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch knowing they just opened so I did give them the benefit of the doubt on some opening kinks. They do have some things to work on but I overall, we had a great meal and we'll definitely return in a few weeks. The Ruben pastrami sandwich was delicious! Highly recommend. Yes, it's expensive for a sandwich but the meat was high quality and very tender. The sweet potato fries and tuna salad were good but I'd probably try other items before ordering those again. Had a cappuccino which was great as well. Canter's is definitely an awesome addition to Tivoli. Give it a few weeks for them to get in the groove of things and then check it out and get the Ruben!"}
{"text":"I had my first dining experience at Canter's today.  Having been born and raised in North East New Jersey, about eighteen miles from New York City, I have had many a deli experience.  This was a totally pleasurable. I ordered pastrami which is a true test for a deli.  It was the most tender meat I have ever tasted. Truly a quality product.  The service was exceptional.  Judy, our server, made the best egg cream west of the Mississippi.  Not only was her service extraordinary, her knowledge of the deli business was amazing.  The owner(s)/managers of this operation should have more like her!"}
{"text":"Best place! The service was great, and the food delicious.  Even satisfied my mom who is an L.A. Canter's fanatic.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this deli to open having lived in Los Angeles.  For my first visit, I took a guest visiting from out of state.  We both had great sandwiches (I had brisket and she had a pastrami reuben).  The meat on both sandwiches was terrific, tender and not salty.  Cole slaw and macaroni salad sides were great.  Cheesecake was excellent.  Couldn't wait to return.  I came alone the second time.  You'd never guess I was in the same restaurant.  Again, I ordered a brisket on rye with macaroni salad.  I ordered fries, but the server never wrote down that part of the order.  The brisket was dry and cold.  The macaroni salad was so slimy, I couldn't eat it.  I asked the server to remove the macaroni salad and bring potato salad which turned out to be dry, loaded with onion and had no seasoning. My server even had the nerve to ask for my payment card before delivering the bill.  Really?   My neighbors went to the deli after hearing me rave about Canter's in Los Angeles for many months.  They said they had the worst  meal ever (chicken soup with no chicken and dry, very expensive, sandwiches).  Bagel Caf√©, a great restaurant/deli has nothing to worry about. This is no way to run a business as famous as Canter's.  I'll be shocked if they make it six months if they don't check what comes out of that kitchen."}
{"text":"Yummy and the service was awesome. Eric our waiter was on point and was amazing. He even has a real Long Island accent!  This is the real deal for deli folks. Visiting my godmother and we had a ton of food. Amazing portion sizes and everything was fast yummy and delicious!  Don't trust skinny yelpers!"}
{"text":"Had the pastrami sandwich which was very good, but the sides of pickles and potato salad was disappointing. The cupcake and pastries were pricey but good."}
{"text":"Honestly I can't say enough good things about this place, the food and staff were fantastic! I got a pastrami Ruben and it was for real life changing, I'm addicted and coming back just forn his pastrami. We also had the cheesecake and..... another slice of cheesecake"}
{"text":"Super duper yummy for my tummy!  The Bagels and Lox really rocks! And the Black and White is out of sight!  And really great service! Love it!"}
{"text":"Walked past the hostess stand, we didn't see it or the hostess. Once she showed up and told us it's so busy we will have to wait.   After we waited, she found a table for us. Food server was friendly, but didn't bring us silverware, never cleared dirty dishes, and took forever to drop off and pick up check.  Food wasn't cheap $11 for half sandwich. $5.95 for a cup of soup. Pastrami was pretty good. Macaroni salad tasted like the Reese stuff from the local grocery store deli. They say it's homemade. It doesn't taste like it.  Overall, food was ok and service was slow. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Made some really positive changes. Food is good, as before. But they've ironed out the big issues from before. Great pastrami and corned beef. The rye bread still isn't great but you can always get another bread."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such a low rating! My friend and I came for an early dinner. Our service was awesome! We both got the corned beef sandwich with a side salad. Our drinks were never empty. Food came out hot and fresh. I think this is a great casual spot for dinner or lunch. There's a lot on the menu to try so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is delicious, we ordered the brisket bagel with fried egg===amazing!  Also had an order of lox and bagels====perfect!  Service was fast and pleasant.  Food was fresh and hot.  The coffee selections were great.  Very clean restaurant, bathrooms were spotless."}
{"text":"We didn't eat yet but Kelly made the experience a5 star deal! No kidding!  She is the best. This place is all about Kelly! Very nice and friendly!  Food will be great cause of her. Will be back for the best food and for Kelly mainly."}
{"text":"I was really excited about Canters opening near by. I tend to stay away from chain restaurants. I made an exception for Canters looking forward to trying the Matzo ball soup. It was pretty bad. The dumplings were dense and did not have much flavor. But the broth was worse it needed salt it tasted like brown water I didn't finish it. The saving grace was the cheesecake it was really really good. Id go for the cheesecake if I was at Tivoli but would not make a special trip. I'm going to stick to Bagel Cafe excellent soup!"}
{"text":"To start with don't go alone.  I had the brisket sandwich and it was so dry I could hardly swallow the last half.  My drink went dry and took several requests a refill.  Don't plan to return."}
{"text":"This deli is amazing!  We are Canter's fans & visited the Canter's in LA on Christmas day. Now that we have a Canter's in Summerlin life is wonderful.  You can't beat the delicious food & great service.  I love the location too, Tivoli Village is a little taste of Italy."}
{"text":"KISS.  You come here to have a classic hot pastrami or corned beef sandwich PERIOD.  Burgers, hotdogs, fries, chili, salads, blah blah blah, go somewhere else.  For the big boys of Jewish delis, the guys with serious history who have survived decades and served generations,  pastrami is their cornerstone.  We're talking Katz's (NYC reigns supreme), Langer's and Canter's.  This one, at Canter's, deeply seasoned with a spicy rub, slow cooked, so moist and tender it quivers when the slab hits the board for slicing.  A heaping pile, about 1/2lb, on slices of fresh baked rye.  A smear of pungent deli mustard if you choose.  A side of zesty, creamy potato salad and a couple of crisp, flash brined pickles.  That's it.  Something with less spice impact, replace the pastrami with an equally good, beautifully brined, it's flavor penetrating all the way through, equally juicy corned beef.     IMPORTANT TIPS:  1.  Don't deviate from the NYC sensibility.  We on the West Coast love choices but seriously, when they opened in 1933 and through the decades, there was no such thing as pastrami on multigrain gluten free mumbojumbo add tomato and cheese.  PASTRAMI ON RYE.  2.  Sandwiches cost $16 - $18 each.  Accept it.  It will set you back as much in NYC or LA.  It's reality.   Service is a little slow as they still try to get their footing.  It will improve with practice.  Simply put, the best pastrami and corned beef sandwiches in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was the rare trifecta of terrible. The service was frighteningly bad. Wrong drinks/food and a server who didn't care. Dirty plates and empty drinks sitting on the table. Plenty of staff standing around doing absolutely nothing. This was a Saturday at 5:30 PM. Our experience was unpleasant to say the least. This looks to be yet another in a long line of failures to come to Tivoli. If overpriced food, horrendous service, and staff that doesn't care is your thing then Canter's is your place. Otherwise the Bagel Cafe on Buffalo is a thousand times better than this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Beat sandwiches and desserts in town. Super cute location. Friendly staff! I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"We used to like Canter's at Treasure Island, long closed, so we were pleased to run across Canter's at the Linq Promenade and went there for a late dinner. Very nice restaurant with photos of the original Canter's in LA covering the walls.  Food was good. We had matzoh ball soup and half sandwich, David had a corned beef reuben with potato salad, and a Rachel with brisket and macaroni salad. No complaints at all about our food. We liked that you could get a reuben or almost any other sandwich as your half sandwich - at the venerable Sherman's in Palm Springs, you can only get plain meat sandwiches with the combo.  Service was another matter. We weren't given napkins or cutlery. The soup came with a spoon so we used that for our salads, but when we asked for napkins it took several minutes (?) to get them. There was only a yellow mustard container on the table. David asked for deli mustard, our server said the container was all they had. She explained they had only been open for 5 weeks. It showed. David discovered the yellow container actually had brown mustard in it, so that was ok. Our soup and sandwich were served at the same time. At other places the soup comes out first, which is nicer. Also the soup portion was a bit small, though the sandwich was generous.   The next table (there were only 5-6 tables occupied as it was around 10 PM) waited agonizingly long to get their bill and to pay. We got our bill pretty quickly and paid cash so we didn't have to wait.   We love Canter's Fairfax and love having the option for Canter's again in Vegas. Hopefully they can work out the startup issues, the good news is the food is already great."}
{"text":"Excellent deli. Had the pastrami- melts in your mouth.  Eric did an awesome job serving our table.  Glad Canter's made it to Vegas."}
{"text":"I got half sandwich and soup. The matzah ball soup was fairly decent. I got half of a corned beef sandwich w coleslaw and Russian dressing. Not a fan of the rye bread w caraway seeds. But overall decent"}
{"text":"I've never waited so long for a bagel sandwich. And it's not even that crowded. We just walked out without food after sitting almost an hour. People behind us had their food, server only provided us updates one time. Ended up getting crappy Starbucks breakfast since our whole morning was wasted. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Stay away. There are better Jewish deli's just down Summerlin Parkway. I understand that this is just a few days after opening but c'mon what a mess. The place was near empty and it still took 2 hours to get our orders. I don't mean complicated orders either. I mean bowls of Matzoh Ball Soup (should be quick an easy ready-to-go in vats back there), salads (again super easy), and Reuben sandwiches (again slice up some meat and slam it on some bread). They kept apologizing for how long it was taking - but offered no discounts or adjustments to the bills to reflect that apology. Also FYI the Reuben is like a $20 plate - and bland! Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions, service slow, got orders wrong...was hoping for our hometown LA Canters...left disappointed. Go to Bagel Cafe for much better food, service and that NY Deli feel."}
{"text":"Such good food... a real deli... such good service. .. these people know how to make a sandwich and make it done right"}
{"text":"They are way over priced. Took way too long to bring our food. The chicken soup was disappointing and didn't have allot of stuff in it.. mainly broth.  The food was just not that special. For a sandwich that was $20 I expected it to be loaded and perfect, but it was just your average deli counter sandwich.   The servers were attentive and seemingly friendly and kept apologizing about the wait. I don't understand what took so long.  It was not worth it and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came to Canter's for a quick bite to eat with some friends, we were pleasantly surprised! The food was superb... ordered an egg white omelette with corned beef, pastrami sandwich, matzah ball soup and a salad. Everything was terrific, omg the pastrami was to die for!!! Our server, Kelsey Romeo was fantastic! She was friendly, knowledgeable and had great customer service! Great job!"}
{"text":"Open on Fairfax since 1931 Canter's Deli was serving Los Angeles before Las Vegas' population cracked 10,000 and although a previous attempt to expand into Sin City at Treasure Island in 2003 apparently did not go so well a recent re-launch at Tivoli Village in Summerlin sees the new space from Celebrity Brands Restaurants making a lot of good choices, though there is a lot of room for improvement as well.  Long considered to be Los Angeles 'other' place for Pastrami, Langer's house-made version considered by most to be superior to that of Canter's which is still brought in from New York, it was with one other that lunch was enjoyed on Friday inside the restaurant officially opened on September 28th and having already adjusted prices due to myriad complaints early-on about being \"More expensive than Los Angeles\" and even \"Strip Priced\" the new menu reads very much like a truncated version of the original with prices not so different from The Bagel Caf√© just a few miles away.  Still doing some marketing by way of its Los Angeles legend, stories of the fourth-generation owned and operated Original told by both signage and a wait-staff that is universally pleasant and welcoming, though still quite green, it was immediately on entering that every guest was greeted with a big smile and \"Welcome to Canters,\" the seating spacious and laid out over the left side of the Restaurant while the right features a Take Out counter plus cases of Desserts, Bagels and Salads.  Mostly filled just prior to noon and completely packed by 12:30, the average diner sporting white or grey hair though several 30-something suits were seen in the midst, it was by a middle-age woman with great manners that the table beneath a continuously blowing vent was served, the offer of Doctor Brown's Soda declined in favor of Iced Tea and Water and several Jewish Deli classics selected in addition to \"The Franklyn\" which appears to have been created specifically for the Las Vegas market.  Serve housemade Pickles prior to the meal, both Cucumbers and Green Tomatoes showing well and working nicely to refresh the palate between plates, it was after the first of two mis-deliveries from a younger waitress that all four plates arrived with a big smile and complete description, the Latkes suggested on the menu to be served as a duo in fact offered as three crisp and hot Pancakes with almost no residual Oil while the split-Knish stacked with Pastrami was a best-of-both-worlds way to experience each item without filling up, the beef appropriately fatty with a modest amount of seasoning while the mixture of Mashed Potatoes and Onions was creamy and comforting without being too dense.  Chatting while eating, the continuous blow of cold air admittedly uncomfortable after a while and not something that was able to be addressed during the course a nearly ninety minute visit, it was after enjoying the lightly sweetened rolled Pancake that the fork and knife Sandwich was approached, the toasted Bagel providing a good chew around steamed Brisket, Cheese, a soft Egg and two styles of Onions served next to Sweet Potato Fries that can be subbed for housemade Coleslaw, Steakhouse Spuds or Potato Salad.  Making both the Bagels and several styles of Cakes and Cheesecakes in-house, the Muffins and several styles of Cookies outsourced to locally-owned Freed's, it was focusing on Canter's own creations that four desserts were ordered, the $8 slices of Cheesecake a bit spendy but absolutely on-point in terms of taste as well as their velvety texture while the $5 Carrot Cake and $2 Black & White Cookie were both generously portioned, the latter not quite as fluffy as Weiss Deli but using far better frosting while the Carrot Cake was moist and dense with a lot of chopped Nuts and plenty of tangy Cream Cheese Icing.  ***1/2 Thus far making a big error at launch in terms of pricing and still not up-to-speed with service it will be interesting to see how Canter's at Tivoli Village evolves with time, the property already notorious for shuttering several restaurants not really a place where starting off on a bad foot seems well advised but the food, at least what was tasted, so far good enough that it can hopefully keep the place afloat as they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"The food was good, but if I'm going to spend $67 on a meal for 2, sans alcohol, I'm going to go to a 'nicer' place.  Sorry Canter's!   The staff was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Awkward, inexperienced servers.   The dressing on the Reuben was excessive and way too sugary sweet.   The bowl of coleslaw looked as if someone had taken a couple bites and sent it back.   They forgot the mustard on the corned beef sandwich (it's in the menu description).   The Matzoh Ball Soup was kind of nice.   Really overpriced."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  This sandwich was lean and mean!!!  Loved the pickles and green tomato assortment too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The Rachel pastrami is literally to die for! And the plain cheesecake is the best I've ever had! Thanks Canters!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! We waited and waited as the waitress just kept walking by ignoring us. When we finally asked to order it still took her 20 min to get to us. My wife ordered a  simple potato knish and the waitress smirked and stated they were out of knishes!!! What kind of Jewish deli runs out of knishes and black and white cookies!!!"}
{"text":"We'd been waiting ages for the opening & since my partner loves Jewish food, I decided to surprise him.  We arrived at Canter's before 4:00 on Friday & were prepared to cut some slack since they had been open just a few days.  It was busy, but still plenty of seating, & we chose a booth.  There were many servers available & the wait wasn't long.  At first glance at the menu I realized why it wasn't yet online... the prices are exhorbitant.  In fact, they're ridiculous on every item, be it B/L/D.    I chose a bowl of matzo ball soup ($9) and my partner chose the Brooklyn sandwich (consisting of brisket, onion, cheese & an egg atop a bagel) with choice of 2 kinds of fries or coleslaw for $13.95.  The food took a half hour to arrive & we had to ask for more water.  The soup was not  as rich in broth as I'm used to & was quite filled with large hunks of potato which I'd not had on that soup before.  Otherwise it was good enough.  He liked his sandwich, though meat was scant & fries were greasy.  Canter's appears to be \"the place to be seen\" & for those with a bigger wallet than average.  Yes, I preferred other items on that menu, & my partner would have chosen a pastrami or corned beef, but the prices were way off compared to two other fine Jewish delis in town."}
{"text":"I have to say overall pretty disappointed the name unfortunately is better then the food. Tried a corn beef and also a turkey sandwich. The corn beef was okay, the turkey was terrible extremely dry not enough flavor at all. Service wasn't the best either.  For the amount of money $45 for two sandwiches and chili cheese fries Jersey mikes blows this place way which is quit sad considering it's suppose to be a speciality deli. Btw don't order the chili cheese fries worth a shot but I recommend saving your money"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!? Let's start with the food. I couldn't have been more disappointed in my experience here which is hard for me because ordinarily I feel you can't go wrong with breakfast. I ordered pancakess & bacon.....simple right?? WRONG....the pancakes are tough and rubbery and the bacon grossly undercooked. I also requested a juice blend (orange & cranberry). My companion ordered a bialy.  We arrived at 9:30, ordered at 9:38, at 9:58 we are still without food and the place was NOT crowded. Yet 2 tables Sat after us received their meals and according to our server eggs and hash browns take less time to make than pancakes.  My question is WHERE???  MY companion had to leave at 10 and still hadn't received her bialy only to be told they didn't have any today. 20 min to find out they don't have what you ordered. UNACCEPTABLE. At 10 we were told they'd send a manager over. 20 min later a manager arrives....takes food away, offers to remake (I've been here nearly an hour NO THANKS).  So now with ALL the Food removed they bring me the bill. $11.26 FOR 2 JUICES. He neglected to tell me that the cranberry juice was in a can so that cost would be in addition to the price of the orange juice which was $3.90 and brought to us on 3/4 full 12 oz. cups. The 4oz can of cranberry juice $2.50. I have never had such horrible service!!  I would never patron here again!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in here on a Thursday afternoon around 2:30PM, and the place was empty.  We were seated immediately and our server was prompt.    My wife ordered the \"Rachael\" (turkey sandwich) and potato salad. She said her sandwich was really good, but the potato salad tasted worse than something out of an old grocery store's refrigerated section; very blah and little to no taste, even after adding salt and pepper.   I ordered the Kevin sandwich (pastrami with coleslaw and russian dressing on it) with fries as my side. I bite into my first French fry and it's COLD, not warm, not even on the warm side, just plain cold.    I inform the server, ask her to touch them, and yes, cold to the touch.  She takes them back and immediately returns with my sandwich stating \"they are making fresh fries now and it'll be a few minutes\". While I wait for my fries, I begin to eat my sandwich, which is good, however,  there is no russian dressing on it.   Potato salad sucks, fries are cold, and my sandwich is missing the dressing; we're done with this place. I tell the server to cancel the fries.  As we are finishing eating a pudgy man with a shirt a couple sizes to small \"trolls\" by our table and asks if everything is OK?  I tell him about the fries and he states \"ya, I know, I comp them\", then states they are making fresh ones and begins to walk away.   So he already knows things are not OK, because he took the fries off our bill, so why wouldn't he, as the manager, not approach the table in a \"managerial way\", and directly address the situation, versus trolling by like he doesn't really care and is just going through the motions like he does past every table.     The man never identifies himself, but we presume he is the manager.  I informed him that I no longer want the fries, and further let him know that in a town like Las Vegas with thousands of good restaurants you cannot afford to serve substandard or mediocre food. He gets a little attitude then waddles off.    A few minutes later he returns with a small container of goodies (cookies, etc.) and states that he will be \"insulted\" if we don't take them.  While we truly appreciate his effort and gesture to make things right, we truly want nothing more to do with this place, keep your cookies. The damage is done.  It's a Thursday afternoon, the place is empty, and they are having issues with the food being cold, not prepared correctly, etc., I would hate to come here when they are busy!       Again, the manger states that he will be \"insulted\" if we don't take his small goodwill gesture, WTF.  He should have thought about that before he insulted me by serving me cold fries, a sandwich without one of it's main ingredients, and my wife's food with little to no taste.      Bottom line - the manager's knowledge, appearance, people skills, and lack of leadership is definitely a direct reflection of this mediocre at best deli. Chef/kitchen manager should be terminated for allowing food to leave the kitchen as there was/is absolutely no, zero, natta reason for it; just poor leadership all around.      It's truly sad as there is nothing better than a great deli, and this one it is NOT!"}
{"text":"Being from New York, I know Canter's deli very well and it is fantastic. This is why I was slightly disappointed by my experience at this specific location. It is simply average, rather than outstanding as in New York. The potato knishes are simply awful. The pastrami sandwich is average and I have had way better. The matzoh ball soup is good yet it is far from the best compared to other places I have eaten at. Someone in our party ordered the meatloaf which came with gravy as well as potatoes and it was OK. The cheesecake with strawberry was good. We ordered a strawberry shortcake as well because they were out of rice pudding and the strawberry shortcake is from Freed's bakery, so it was very good. Would I come here again? Not really sure... Probably not... I simply was not all that impressed. I also noticed the place was pretty empty. Overall, just average and I would say I'm disappointed. On the bright side, the service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Online ordering is available."}
{"text":"Best food in town 5 stars . The gull pickles s d green pickled tomatoes are the best. Goes great with the goose IPA . Great lunch & prices  Kerri was a great waitress and a sweetheart"}
{"text":"Excellent server- Kelly.  She was super sweet and fast.  We had standard bacon, eggs, and hash browns... a cup of chicken soup and a matzo ball... and a half corned beef sandwich.... and a side order of fries... we left stuffed and content!  Will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick family dinner with the wife, mother-in-law and aunt. Josh was our waiter. He was entertaining and efficient. Loved the homemade deli pickles and green tomatoes! Family had chicken noodle soup, which was delish, but could have been a little hotter. Also had beef brisket sandwich and pastrami sandwich. Sides included macaroni salad and coleslaw, both heavenly! Definitely tastes like NY! Great service (thanks, Josh) and excellent food. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"7:15 AM on a Sunday; if they can't get it right with only 8 customers, I don't know how they can possibly function when it gets busy! 20 minutes before we were able to order, 40 more for fruit and granola, a 1/2 sandwich and 2 eggs. Pathetic.  The Pastrami is fantastic, we have ordered from the Canter's in Tivoli Village many times and their service and food is exemplary. I don't know if it the same franchisee operates this location or not, but Canter's at the Linq promenade was a terrible experience. The service was the WORST I have ever experienced in Las Vegas, and in this town, that is saying something. Obviously I am not alone in my opinion of their lackluster service, as evidenced by the reviews of others. Perhaps the management should take some interest in the reasons for the slow, unprofessional service one receives when visiting this establishment. The rent in this location must be expensive, but with service like theirs, I'm sure it won't be an issue much longer. Shame on the \"Management\"/owner for taking no interest in the opinions of their (former) customers."}
{"text":"Went in expecting something amazing.  It was really just ok. We waited about 10-15 mins to be seated. Placed our order right away and food took about 12 minutes to arrive. The server was nice but overall the service is meh. Had the $19 pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup and the wife had a lox platter (not on menu). The pastrami was amazing. Very tasty and so tender but the bread was mediocre. For $19 I was hoping for something, more... The soup was very good. Wife said the salmon was good but the first bagel they brought was burnt to a crisp. They replaced it half way through the meal. The replacement bagel was delicious!  The pickles were a little too salty and they forgot my fries completely. Overall it was a lackluster experience, especially for the price but hey they gotta pay for Tivoli Village rent. Haha!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY Disappointing. As others have commented, I also grew up in LA and am familiar with LA Canters. This was nowhere close. I gave them the benefit of the doubt as far as the slow service, seeing that is was opening weekend and they got slammed but... 1) WAY over priced. I don't any justification for a $20 sandwich. I don't care what their reasoning is behind it. Get yourself inline with market prices. 2) Pastrami was thickly sliced, NOT how it's supposed to be! 3) Menu said that the sandwich comes with mustard and Swiss, All I got was meat and bread.  Needless to say, I won't be going back and it's a shame. A good deli is hard to find..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today to grab some lunch with my wife.  Ordered a pastrami Reuben and she ordered chopped liver toast on white.  (I know white bread and chopped liver is sacriligous).  Since the place was fairly empty I thought it took a really long time for the food to come out.  When it finally arrived her chopped liver was on rye.  Spoke to the waiter and sent it back.  Waiter blamed the kitchen I lay partial blame on the waiter who did not write down the order at the table.  After a couple of minutes he came back and now it was on untoasted white bread.  It's called chopped liver toast.  Toasting is on the name. I pointed this out to him as well and again he blamed the kitchen.  Hey buddy how about checking your order before you deli we it especially since you had to refire it. Didn't change this out as the wife said it was fine. Finally we get to the food.  The Reuben was good pastrami was tender. The cole slaw however was dry and tasteless.  Switched it out for potato salad which wasn't much better.  The chopped liver was good but nothing special. The waiter tries to make it right by offering some free dessert which was appreciated.  But then he proceeded to top of my unsweetened iced tea.witb some fruity tropical ice tea that I hate. I had enough...check time.  Only reason I left what for me is a mediocre tip was because he put in some effort even though I partially blame him for the screw ups. Won't be paying these prices for mediocre service or just ok deli. Back to Bagel Cafe for me"}
{"text":"The chicken soup was more like chicken broth in a can. There was no chicken and the matzah ball was not up to par by any means. The corned beef was fatty. They do have a big selection of bagels but I for one was simply disappointed."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich is huge and can be split for two unless you're looking to be extremely full."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a long time to go to this place. What a disappointment the corned beef sandwich is 20.00 and cup of matzo ball soup 8.00. The corned beef was tender and good but the sandwich is small. Matzo ball was so dense I have to cut it with a knife. They don't even have the meats that a typical deli has. No salami and no liverwurst. Menu is really restricted and pricey. So having said all of this Bagel cafe will still be our place to go!"}
{"text":"I was looking so forward to Canters opening at Tivoli because I'm originally from LA. Unfortunately, they were so disorganized and the list of things they didn't have on the menu was longer than the list of things they did have. We ordered the pastrami which on the menu said it came with Swiss cheese. When we got our sandwich, no cheese. We were told there was a printing mistake on the menu! What? You would think for $20 for a sandwich they could throw on a slice of cheese! We then watched all the mangers keep apologizing to various tables and customers calling on the phone to complain as well. My sister tried ordering a couple of different dishes and the waiter kept saying, \"I'm sorry we are out of that!\" Really? On the second day of opening! Look at this picture! Can you tell they weren't ready to open when they bring you a ketchup cup with the price tags skill on it! I miss the Fairfax Canters!!!!"}
{"text":"As good as LA.   Classic Jewish diner with all the fixin's. Canters has a special place in my heart after many adventures to the LA establishment and I only recently discovered the hidden promenade in Vegas which features an \"as authentic as the original\" iteration of the diner. Unfortunately I didn't notice whether they duplicated their fantastic bakery but I'll save that for a future visit.   Love this greasy spoon kinda food on the fly. I had a burger, bunless- I believe it was the Canters burger- no cheese & comes with Russian dressing. It was perfect- a thinner patty but served as requested with a side salad. My husband had the corn beef hash & eggs, a staple that you can't go wrong with at a diner. Their selection of omelettes looked mouthwateringly good.    Service was fast, place was new & spic/span. Think booths and high tops- that's what you'll find here although there is also an outside area which offers misters to keep cool.   The people here really got me. They were down to earth & friendly. It made it feel even more authentic like the original family run business. I'm glad they're keeping to their values. As a patron it comes through & by comparison to breakfast at iHop on the strip - we'll take this over that any day of the week. It's a night & day difference in service and attention. We were here when it was quieter but seeing how they are I imagine you'd still get service when busy. Time'll tell though as we'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for late dinner (8pm) on a friday night. Service: excellent. Seated in moments, drinks in minutes, order arrived quickly and accurately for everyhting we tried. They even brought me a taste of pastrami as I have never had it. Food: excellent. Hot dog, open-faced turkey sandwich with onion strings, latkes, french fries. All portions where I can have half there and take half home for another meal. Well worth the price the others are all aching over... ever been to other places at Tivoli?  I think this is better tasting than cheesecake factory (one mall over) and much cheaper than there, too.  I look forward to many more visits, and expect all the wrinkles others have noted will iron out as they settle into being open. There were no wrinkles to me."}
{"text":"Disorganized take out.   Would have bought more but seemed too long to wait  black n white Cookie was delicious and fresh. Love B&W cookies."}
{"text":"Was so excited to go here. Very disappointed. Service was terrible. Food disappointing. Unlikely we will go back.  There are several delis in town that have this deli beat by a mile.  The pastrami sandwich was very disappointing, so we where  hoping, just  maybe,  the cheesecake might be good, but our normal slow waitress, brought us the bill without even asking if we wanted dessert."}
{"text":"Don't go there!!! First the hostess wasn't there and we went inside to ask about the seating because more poeple were lining up behind us, some girl said .\"oh she is probably busy go stand outside and wait!\" So we did for 5 more mins. We asked for a seat outside and it was about 10:30 so here in Vegas the sun is pretty strong and I wanted a table under the shade so the hostess said ,\" No u have to sit on this one!\" The sun was directly on it so a waiter opens some shades and starts taking our order. 40 minutes later he comes back and tells us ,\"funny story I forgot to put in your order!!\" How is that funny??? We have been sitting there waisting our time!! We got up and left and as we were walking away we noticed Everyone else had also been waiting for a very long time and were getting impatient meanwhile 3 waiters are hanging out gossiping!!! Terrible service and terrible atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I'd give zero stars if I could,ate here earlier with my husband and 2 kids,waited forever for food only to be brought out breakfast potatoes that were like 90 years old and hard as rocks (pic posted) My husband was charged 12 dollars for a side salad that said 2.99 with purchase,couldn't let the waitress know cause of course she never came around,except for an hour later to bring us a check for the most disgusting food and terrible service,I would never eat there again,waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Love the sandwich's.  I lived in Brooklyn my whole life .  This is the closes deli in Vegas.  The potato salad is sooooo good.  The service ,,,,even to go. Was so nice.   Will go here a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment. They over promise and SERIOUSLY underdeliver. The sandwiches were modest in size (and $20!!!), the meat cut too thick, and the sides (macaroni or potato salad) were miniscule, but the sliders were a joke; when I saw the plate come out with three huge buns, I thought I would never be able to finish them but - surprise! - when I opened the buns I found that the meat patties were the size of silver dollars. No exaggeration - they were so tiny that had I ordered them without buns I think the waitress would have been embarrassed to serve them. They have Dr. Brown's celery soda on the menu, but they were out of it - on day four (!?!), blaming their supplier (you can order it on Amazon for overnight delivery). I am from New York, having lived there and enjoyed REAL Jewish delis for many years, and this is NOT a New York style Jewish deli.  If you go there expecting that you will be greatly disappointed and out a lot of money for nothing. The wait staff did make a huge effort, but I suspect that is because they know they have signed on to a loser and are trying to make the best of it. I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced The Bagel calf on Buffalo is a lot better and cheaper , also bad service even though they're a new place it's understandable but they was 50 workers no excuse"}
{"text":"First experience wasn't great, but I'm willing to try it again... We went with much anticipation as former New Yorkers (I realize it's an L.A. brand, but the Canter bros. were originally from Jersey City) hoping for a solid deli more convenient to us than our stand-by, Bagel Cafe.   Matzo ball soup was good although we had four cups on the table, and some had bits of chicken & vegetables while others were just broth.  Good matzo ball and broth, though, so at its core, it was fine.    Turkey Reuben ran a bit dry, which is a danger when ordering turkey, for sure, so no foul there.  Cheese was not quite melted with the sandwich, though.  It's as if the cheese was melted separately then placed on the sandwich, but cooled a bit in transfer, so it essentially sat on top of the turkey.  We had two of those on the table, and they were prepared the same way, so points for consistency, I suppose.  Sidebar:  Potato latke was crisp but a little bland, and cole slaw notably lacked character as well.  Staff was welcoming, though our server kept pushing Russian dressing and kept questioning our requests:  \"Are you sure you want more drink?\"  \"Are you sure you want to order that?  It's a big plate!\"    Kicker for me was when I ordered a brisket sandwich and he brought me pastrami.  I pointed it out, he immediately agreed, and he took it back, but quickly returned with it saying they had changed the recipe, and it was brisket.  \"Since 1931\" and they just changed the recipe?!  Either way, it was pastrami, and if I let myself think about it too long, a Las Vegan trying to pass-off pastrami as brisket to a New Yorker is enough to make me upset... but I digress.  For some reason, he did not want to take it back to the kitchen.  Fortunately, I'm easy, and they are known for their pastrami, so I was fine with eating the PASTRAMI sandwich.  It was good, but I'd still like to try the brisket some day."}
{"text":"Excellent food, classy ambiance, friendly staff with a team player attitude.    Bring your piggy bank because it's pricey...,,light fluffy matzo ball soup, generous meets in the sandwiches....great latkes, lots of tempting baked goods..,,very yummy"}
{"text":"We sat for 10 minutes before anybody came to the table and they only came because I called them over. I just watched people who came in after us get their food. Took half an hour to get ours. They are out of OJ  and egg bagels!! What kind of deli runs out of orange juice and bagels at 11 o'clock in the morning!  And very expensive. Not surprised rating is only 2 1/2 stars. Go to bagel caf√© much better value for the money.  Def an experience not to be repeated. No wonder place is half empty. Such a shame"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a real deli on the west side of Las Vegas.  However, we were disappointed.  I would think that when a restaurant opens it would put it's best foot forward.  This place stumbled. Four of us recently came to Canter's for dinner.  We ordered the potato knish.  When it was finally delivered to the table it resembled the frozen knishes you could find at Smith's Supermarket-not a real knish.  What was worse, it had been cooked (or fried) so long that it was as hard as a rock and we had to send it back.  We ordered a brisket sandwich.  One of the things that sets brisket apart is that it is juicy and moist and cooked slowly for a long time.  The brisket we received was so dried out that it was almost inedible.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich.  Corn been, regular or lean, should also be juicy and moist.  The corned beef we received was so dry it stuck to your tongue. We received the sandwiches 40 minutes after we ordered them.  The restaurant was almost empty at the time so a delay was unacceptable.  We never received pickles or the cole slaw which should come with the sandwiches.  We asked for a manager to explain the situation with the hope that positive criticism would help the place.  No one was around who we could talk with.  We left almost all of the food, paid, and went some place else for dinner. I would think a new restaurant would pay attention to detail, have a prepared kitchen staff who knew hoe to cook the food, and provide at least a modicum of service. Great expectations dashed!"}
{"text":"The chicken salad is excellent and the pastrami melts in your mouth. This place is so good I would bring my mother in law here! It's that goid!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to see Canter's here, as it was just the kind of food we were in the mood for.  It was lunch time, and not too busy, but it still took awhile for anyone to show up at the host stand so we could be seated. We then waited and waited and waited for a waiter.  Not an acknowledgement by anyone or even a glass of water.  Finally, a waiter stopped by after about 15 minutes and said he'd be right back.  We then watched as he dealt with a few other tables for another 5+ minutes.  He then landed at the booth behind ours, and proceeded to have a VERY long friendly chat, completely ignoring the fact that we were STILL waiting.  That was the last straw, and we left.  Told him and the host we were leaving, but nobody seemed too concerned."}
{"text":"Before a High Roller ride, my husband & I decided to have a breakfast nearby. We were surprised to see Canter's Deli from our Yelp app. Since we're from LA, we had been to the Fairfax location.      At 1st, we were skeptical because of the 2 star rating and the negative reviews. But as  we're in the casino area we took our chances (LOL). And we're grateful that we did.      1st win:  Upon entry, we were greeted by a smile as we were seated in a comfortable place. Noticed the cleanliness of this deli, great atmosphere.       2nd win: service - Our drinks were served real quick. Our orders came just right on time & were served hot the way that I requested from our server.       3rd win: food - OMG. My hubby ordered the pastrami sandwich. I ordered the combo sandwich (pastrami & corned beef) . We added the matzo ball soup. These came with sides of pickles and green tomatoes. The rye bread was soft & fresh. The matzo ball was savory.  The huge serving of pastrami was seriously delicious & melted in our mouths.        For the negative price comments: our huge servings relatively covered 2 meals versus 1 meal, not to mention the great taste of our food, clean place and cozy dining area.  Come on, you're in Vegas. I bet everyone else spends more to have fun. Then why not spend on something that satisfies your hunger & gives you a nice dining experience.          Canter's - you're now in the list our favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my husband and loved their pastrami sandwich. So, decided to take our friends here, it was a let down..the meat was actually a little tough this time and missing that good flavor we had the first time we had it. We brought our friends here a couple times and we are convinced too that the customer service is cold. The people in the back and the one making our food has this unhappy faces and they just will stare or look at you with \"why are you here kinda face\" not so friendly employee. Not sure if we want to give this place another try to redeem themselves. Undecided right now."}
{"text":"Great service by Jay!! He had us laughing.   Good food, good prices, but disappointed - no black & white cookies - but the rugelah was outstanding!"}
{"text":"So terrible.....disappointing..borderline A JOKE!!!    It is sad.  We waited for canters to open.  These comments, as negative as they sound,  are even worse than they wrote.  I Will NOT return.  Pastrami and corned beef good....but at what price???  The management needs to print out these comnents and use them as a Learning and Training tool..sad  sad  sad!!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant? with the kitchen staff from New York, amazing find!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the Food Only. Came here after my kids soccer game to feed my hunger. I ordered the nova and lox open faced bagel ($18). In my opinion it could be a little cheaper for what it is. Also didn't get Any Pickles!  My daughter got the latkes (potato pancakes) with a side of sour cream and applesauce. Those were very good but a little under salted. We also ordered the corned beef and hash which was a little different than I've had before it almost had like a raw flavor to it my kids wouldn't eat it so between my husband and myself we ate it. It could've used some salt as with the eggs and hash browns on the plate. The matzo ball soup was good but I thought it was going to have chicken and when it came to the table I was disappointed to see it did not maybe I had to ask idk usually when I order it, it comes with chicken.    This review/rating 2 is for customer service:  didn't get any refills which bummed me out bc we'd been out all morning so I was parched. Another server came to our table to take our drink order before our actual server came, he seemed bothered she apologized and went on her way. Barely came around our table to ask if we needed drinks, napkins, or anything for that matter. I'd maybe come back but would have to save up for it.    4 stars for cleanliness I really like it better than the one in LA."}
{"text":"Pretty space but definitely NOT an impressive opening nor is it reminiscent of the real Canter's on Fairfax. Missing is the kitsch factor from the years and history that comes with time, a young eager staff that would benefit from a trip to the original -- no pickles???   Prices reasonable, especially for the area, but probably not worth a return visit, unfortunately."}
{"text":"After reading all of the good reviews, I feel even worse about my experience here. I have to say I am from the East and I come from a city of great Jewish corned beef. Canter's was a huge disappointment. To begin with, no phosphates so an egg cream (a phosphate with milk added, so why no phosphates?) was ordered. It had so little chocolate syrup that it was almost tasteless. Next, the matzoh ball soup had no taste but salt. I make chicken soup from chicken, water, carrots, celery, parsley, and a touch of onion, this just tasted like water, even the carrots and celery in the soup were flavorless! The third strike was the corned beef, which was not Jewish deli corned beef but was heavily flavored with clove! Who puts cloves in deli corned beef? Cloves in corned beef are New England boil fare, not deli! The corned beef was sliced too thick and with the grain, so it was tough and nearly unchewable! I am told the countermen are former Katz deli workers but, I have had corned beef at Katz's, Carnegie deli, Corky & Lenny's, Slyman's, Stage deli, Vienna, other \"big\" delis, and homemade by my bubbie, and I have never had tough, thick corned beef like they served at Canter's. Again, cloves, really? Finally, I don't mind paying for quality, but this was NOT quality. I must warn everyone, Canter's chopped liver is beef liver. Also, their menu is so very limited, you would think they could master those few options!  I'll never go back to Canter's. It was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. I can't imagine anyone who knows delis will be pleased or satisfied with a meal at Canter's!  I have to add, I see the managers answering the bad reviews here and repeatedly saying their corned beef has 7% fat. I call b.s. on that 7% fat statement. My cousin's corned beef had so much fat, she put it in a container to take home to her dog, and that container was full! I would also say that it doesn't matter how high the quality of the ingredients are if they are mishandled and served poorly!    Be warned, Canter's is not a \"real\" Jewish deli!"}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow. When we were seated , it took them 15 minutes to come to us. Once the order was placed, they took another 30 minutes to get bagel and oatmeal. That's just ridiculous!!! Would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"As someone who ate at the Canters location in Los Angeles for 20 years I can tell you that this is NOT Canters! This is an imitation and a totally different restaurant. Food is not as flavorful as it is supposed to be, bakery does not serve the New York style desserts,  The deli selections are totally limited and don't even look fresh. The portion size and plating or completely different so IF you are from Los Angeles and you were expecting to have the Canters experience you will NOT get it here.  I was NOT impressed with the attitude of the staff or the food."}
{"text":".  Classic deli menu w/gr8 service and quality food.   Waitress was attentive and caring.  I like the soups And sandwiches.   My wife and I were in pastrami heaven.  Waitress was caring and attentive.  Kind of pricey.   High rent + heavenly corn beef=more moolah.  Lots of drinks, sides, desserts & ambiance."}
{"text":"Three stars because the wait staff couldn't be friendlier!!!  The hash browns were soggy. Many of the bagel flavors weren't available. The baked pastrami omelette was ok but not great."}
{"text":"I have been waiting patiently for Canters to open at Tivoli village.. and it was worth the wait..  Let's be honest it's only the 2nd day of operation and there are issues in service and supply that need to be resolved and fine tuned.. but I am sure they will get there.   The food is what I want from a casual deli dining experience... what I remember from growing up in California. Great taste, great portions and satisfying.  The vibe of the restaurant is more NYC than Las Vegas or even Los Angeles..kind of loud and energized.  I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Pastami, second only to Katz's in NY! Thick, tasty, NY potato knish. Even the pickles were great. Debbie, our server was very personable and attentive. So glad they opened. Better than the Canters in LA!"}
{"text":"Having been to the Fairfax Los Angeles location many times, I have to say I'm very disappointed. The food was more expensive and not nearly as good. I had a half pastrami sandwich with matzo ball soup. Comes with a side of potato salad that had absolutely no taste whatsoever. Pastrami sandwich was decent but the matzoh ball soup was not very tasty at all. Service was excellent and friendly, and the owner came by to introduce herself. Unfortunately I do not choose my restaurants based on good service alone."}
{"text":"Real quick. Food is ok but not worth price. Service was not good. Given they only opened recently, I'll try again later but for now don't rush in. Big disappointment. Update: brought check. Wasn't ours. Clueless at every step."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad! You know when you are opening a restaurant with the Canter's name and your website has nothing on it?!! You have no where near the menu LA does!!! Get your menu up online before you open!!!!! Have a to go order menu printed to give to people so they don't have to take pictures of the menu ! And the guy behind counter said we are working on that?! Working on that?!! You open and you don't have simple things such as website and menus?!! Wow! Also, I called to place a to go order and was told sorry we don't do that yet?! Wait ... what you cannot simply allow me to order over the phone?!! Person taking my order was so slow and incompetent it was sad! Went back later like and idiot for another order and they managed to give me wrong order after I spent $100! I get home to notice so far off to what i ordered my daughter could not eat it! Also, $3.95 for a \"side\" of potato salad?! Haha it's the size you squirt ketchup or mustard to go in size!!!! Ha ! Canter's if I could give a ZERO I WOULD HAVE! You in no way hold a candle to Bagel Cafe! They have it together, better food, competent staff, better prices ! I will not be back ! I am done! Too many things wrong ! Do not associate your name with the name Canter's and suck! That's all"}
{"text":"So we are frequent Vegas visitors and always on the hunt for good places to eat.  Canter's is a nice addiction to our repertoire of breakfast places. The food was good; your standard eggs and such from a diner or deli. Nothing outstanding.   Canter's serves breakfast all day so that's nice and the selection looks good, however the service was really sub par.  I had ordered rye toast.  They bake on the premises, so I wanted to try it.  A food runner brought our meal and forgot the toast and then forgot that he forgot the toast.  Our server was no where to be found.  He never checked back on us.  We waited for what seemed like forever and finally flagged down a different server.  Eventually we got some toast which I didn't get to eat with my eggs.  Maybe next time.  We will probably come back and hope for better service next time."}
{"text":"So it was my first time visiting Canters. No wait so that was awesome! We did wait a bit for our server but when he did come by his positivity and honesty about our wait was highly appreciated. They did not carry a lot of their menu items but our server Josh gave us the rundown on what they did have. I Gave a 4 star review based off of our service and quality of our food. Food was AWESOME!! We had Josh give our compliments to the chef! If you can, ask for Josh you won't be sorry! Great server with a positive attitude and doing extremely well with what they've got here!"}
{"text":"Just tried Canters for the first time all I can say is great corn beef on their Ruben sandwich probably the leanest meat I've had on a sandwich in Vegas over the last 12 years beats all other deli style sandwich places.  I would recommend trying their Ruben lean choice sandwich you'll be ordering a second one I did.   Keep delivering great food and thank you Romeo for excellent service.  Don"}
{"text":"Ok so... I wasn't expecting the best deli I've ever been to coming in.   I usually notice that the larger a chain gets the less the quality of the food is important.  Also, this location hasn't been open for very long so there are going to be a few kinks no matter what.   Upon walking in we had no idea what to do.   Someone at the meat counter was very friendly and asked if we wanted a sample of anything which is very nice but we were lost.   There were quite a large amount of employees but they all seemed to be being trained.   We went to a register that was closed but the girl standing there didn't acknowledge us or point us in the right direction.  Finally I asked what looked like the manager and she told us there was only one register.   The cashier at this register was training 2 others and he was very nice and friendly.     The food we ordered was actually better than I expected!  The corned beef was delicious and I've never had pickled green tomatoes and I thought they were great.  The potato knish had a great flavor but the outside was super tough.   Like I could hardly rip it tough.   If I ate gluten  (the knish totally has gluten and I had hives for it but it was that good inside) I totally would have ordered a bagel because they looked pretty delicious.   Overall I think this place succumbs to typical Vegas Strip chain eating.   Very expensive but pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere close to have breakfast and ran across this new restaurant.   I had the Corned Beef Hash and my husband had the French toast.  Both meals were delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible experience and here is why. I drove 40 minutes to be disappointed. I called at 6 and was told by the hostess they are open until 10.  No it's 9.  I called in my order.  Corned beef and pastrami. The sandwich comes with potato macaroni or cole slaw as a side. I thought it was another side and the cole slaw came automatically with this special sandwich.  Well it doesn't. I was VERY specific I wanted cole slaw. When I arrived the dark haired lady with the lovely accent said to the young man behind the counter to check the order twice three times and four times. So I drive all the way home and I get to sit down to a tiny and I mean tiny corn beef and pastrami with some type of jalape√±o or spicy creme cheese. The pickles are not sour st all. How do you serve a sandwich like this without a sour, not half sour pickle. They also have the audacity to sell dr Browns sodas for 3.50.  Pretty much a greasy tiny sandwich and rubbery knish for 26 dollars.   -----------  Just ate the sandwich. Could not tell where the meats started and stopped. It all tasted the same. There was no graininess to the corn beef nor any bark to the pastrami. It was all just a greasy and creamy ( fat texture ) mess. Maybe would have been a better flavor if I got the cole slaw and not creme cheese."}
{"text":"I've never felt the need to post a negative review about anything on Yelp, much less a restaurant, but after having been to Canter's in Tivoli Village on three separate occasions, I must finally say something.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I would have given zero stars if I could.  Seriously, it's been a nightmare each and every time I've been there.  I work in Tivoli village and waiting with anticipation for the opening on this \"restaurant\" for months before it opened.   Knowing what I know now, however, they would have been better off delaying their opening (beyond the amount they already delayed it) until such time as they could get their sh%t together.  This place is full of frantic, disengaged, unknowledgeable, and overall hard to deal with employees, managers, you name it, from the top down.  After my most recent trip (I keep wanting to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that next time will be different) I finally said something to the manager, Elizabeth.  I told her about issues I had had on all three of my trips there, including the most recent one in which despite placing my order online, getting an email confirmation and estimated \"pick up\" time for my food, they seemed to have no idea about my order and literally took about 20 minutes to basically start from scratch (this was on top of the 20-25 minutes I had already waited to show up based on the time given in the email confirmation of my order.    At no point during my conversation with manager Elizabeth did she apologize, ask what she could do to fix things, or otherwise show much (ie any) real concern about things.  I can't fathom how anyone running a restaurant (much less a restaurant in service-oriented Las Vegas) doesn't understand the basics of keeping customers happy.  It's textbook stuff that she either doesn't know or doesn't implement, either way it's unacceptable. Her response was instead to give me a laundry list of reasons why things were the way they are at Canter's.  Everything from being too busy, understaffed, etc.  THOSE ARE THE RESTAURANT'S PROBLEMS, no mine.  You'd be wise not to make your problems those of your customers, customers that by the looks of things, are vanishing at an ever-growing rate.    It's a shame this place is so disorganized, poorly run, and overpriced, because I truly wanted them to do well and give folks who work and visit Tivoli one more dining option.  Unfortunately, this place reeks of yet another restaurant that will close its doors in the not so distant future.  I sure hope the corporate folks at Canter's in Southern California realize the damage being done to their brand here in Las Vegas.  I won't be going back and I cannot in good conscience suggest this to my family, friends, or colleagues.    Stay away from this place, you'll save yourself countless headaches."}
{"text":"I was not aware they had a location near the High Roller until I ventured out for a walk that night. They used to have a location inside the TI Sports Book and they left several years ago and a horrible Chicago deli has replaced Canters. I used to eat at Canters when I lived in LA and thought this deli was about as close to NYC as you would find on the Left coast.  I enjoyed a wonderful pastrami sandwich which reminded me of Katz deli in NYC. The pastrami was hearty and melt in your mouth and they even let me have a sample while I waited for my sandwich. Service was great, waitress was super friendly and so was the other staff. I have definitely found a new home for pastrami and prices are much more reasonable than the overpriced Carnegie deli in the Mirage across the street.  I am looking forward to visiting this joint on my next trip to Vegas in April."}

{"text":"Decided to try Canter's at Tivoli Village....disappointing on every level....came in around 10 am on a Saturday..., place was pretty empty yet service was very inattentive....had to ask for coffee refill and it took for ever to get our check. Food:  meh...first coffee was barely warm.   I ordered corn beef hash.... which was just ok.   Did not have a great consistency and tended to be wet.  Also was lukewarm.   Bagel was definitely not a real NY bagel ... and lox smear was blah. Certainly did not live to my memories of LA Canter's!"}
{"text":"Why would you open a deli and be out of potatoes latkes,corned beef, turkey and plain bagels??? We came two days in a row. Finally had to settle for the meatloaf which was served cold! I ordered it with mashed potatoes and they brought fries....twice! This is worse than grand opening quirks. It's poor management both in chef and GM. Won't be back."}
{"text":"When this place opened up, I was excited to try it.  They have a huge menu.  They serve breakfast all day as well.  They seem to have gone down hill since they opened.  Their breakfast items have always seemed over cooked to me.  The service has never been good.  When I call in orders to take home, at least one or more items is wrong.  They have also limited their hours, which is not a good sign either.  With plenty of great places to eat in that area, this might be one of the places you avoid."}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience.. I love deli food.. raised on the east coast and having been raised on Ruben Sandwich's and Matzah Ball Soup..We drove from the east side of town to try the place out for lunch. The girl at the take out counter was very friendly and nice welcoming us..after that everything went down hill..  We were seated... we sat there for at least 10 to 15 minute before anyone even greeted  us.. the single gentlemen that was seated after us... was already served, he already had a beverage and his soup.. Finally the bus person asked us for beverages.. and we continue to sit there.. I watched the single gentleman across from us he already had his food by the time the server came by..  I also observed a booth, it look like a group manger having a meeting in the corner..while this was going on.. Finally the server came to take our order and were then told they were out of Corn Beef for a Ruben.. REALLY....This Is Lunch Time 12:00 noon.. I had to then look over the menu again.. I ordered 1/2  Beef Brisket Ruben.. with a Soup that took forever.. That was the driest Sandwich I have ever had.. The sever was really nice and offered something else.. I just settle eating my soup..I could get a better sandwich at Subway for a cheaper price and not have waited a hour to eat..  To top it off our experience the Computer system went down and had to wait to get a bill.. we waited again for the system to come back up..then we were told that they could only take cash that the credit card system was down What would happen if I did not have cash!!!! The only good thing the Manager, that was sitting in the booth happened to stop by our table and we explained our situation.. very nice.. He took some stuff off our check..it took 2 hour for lunch and all I had was soup and onion rings.. I will definitely not be returning anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Our 1st time eating here, was pretty good. Good food, but, don't order their knish...they're less than delicious.   Everything else was delish, especially the matzo ball soup and potato salad."}
{"text":"Canter's makes a trip to Carnegie Deli at the Mirage unnecessary!  My corned beef Rachel was excellent and Pam loved her pastrami sandwich with the Rachel treatment..  The cole slaw is fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a warm pastrami sandwich  on seeded Rye.  The meat was not seasoned enough for my taste but it was lean and a very generous portion.  We placed our order at the counter and took our food outside because it was such a nice day. One sandwich was more than enough for the two of us and we shared the side of potato salad. The pickles and tomatoes were delicious."}

Leaving price out of the equation, the pastrami was bland, thickly sliced, flaky and firm textured, and very under seasoned, as if someone blanched them before serving. Pickles were salt rubbed cucumbers no more than a day old it seemed. There were a large number of staff so the effort is there but the coordination didn't seem to be quite there yet. Overall I'd give them a mulligan as it really seemed like a soft opening and the brine may have been way diluted for some reason.  Really wish they can turn this around as the promise of a good deli in Summerlin is more than welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some breakfast. I had the salmon Benedict and by friend had the pastrami Benedict - my friend made the better choice. Both were good, but the pastrami was much better. As early as we were there we six other folks dining as well. One of my pet peeves on Benedicts  was realized - the hollandaise sauce was not warm. I love warm sauces - this led to loss of a star. The place is very nice, open and airy. The location being in tivoli village, means you will pay a bit more. I grabbed some bagel chips to go at $3.79 a bag they were a great snack for the  rest of the day.  For me, I wouldn't return for breakfast  there are so many better options but I do want to return for a deli, more precisely a pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"Way, way, way over priced. Seventeen dollars for 1/2 sandwich and soup. Corned beef is good, but soup has no flavor. The other sandwich ordered was incorrect. Service is mediocre at  best.  Most likely won't return."}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars because of Sam, the bus boy, who came to our rescue and took our order tonight. He did a great job making sure we got everything we ordered and kept checking in with us. You can tell he was able to handle a fast pace environment. He was the only employee who didn't look confused. There seemed to be enough waiters and waitresses, but they all looked very overwhelmed. As a result, we sat for a very long time without a waiter or waitress coming to our table to acknowledge us or at least take our drink order. Tonight being their 2nd night open, I'll cut them some slack. Thanks to Sam, we had dinner and the food was very good. Unfortunately, the kitchen ran out of some of my first choices on the menu... All I can say is that this bus boy saved the night because we were about to walk out. Fast service is just as important as having good food, so I can only hope they make him a waiter. Good Luck Sam!"}
