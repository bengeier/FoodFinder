{"text":"Absolutely baffled to see the lower rating.  This was our go to restaurant since it was close to the Sheraton and every single time we went the food was FANTASTIC and plentiful.  Was my first time trying poutine....wow.  The egg, salmon, and cream cheese frittata was delicious, along with the salad.  Great pizza, great service.  Met a great waitress by the name of Sonya who was a fantastic waitress...sweet and personable.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well the food was edible. The steak I asked for medium well came just barely medium. The fries were great - I appreciate fresh cut fries. But the plastic fork and knife I was given to eat the steak was disappointing. I ordered room service to the hotel next door and expected typical room service hospitality... you know... a tray, cutlery, maybe water??!! Nope! I was served like it was take out in a plastic bag and struggled as you can imagine to cut the steak with my plastic fork and knife. I gave up at one point and just ate with my hands. Good thing i had the privacy of my room. The dessert in a jar I ordered looked and tasted like it was a month old and the graham crust was absolute mush. Next time I stay at this hotel I will either order a pizza (it would certainly be cheaper) or not be so lazy and venture out a block or two to somewhere better."}
{"text":"I have been to Addies three times for lunch, once for a work happy hour and once to watch the hockey game with friends on a Saturday night.

The food is of amazing quality, generous in portion size and very well priced.  The salads are fresh and always have just the right amount of homemade dressing...Never drenched in Kraft or store bought vinaigrettes like most restaurant salads!  I have to say, as a nacho lover, Addies makes the best nacho's I have had (besides homemade)!  The food is seriously delicious and reminds you of what you would make for yourself. 

The service is excellent.  Whether its a warm greeting from the owners when you walk in or the friendly smile of one of the waiters, Addies is all about raising the customer service bar in a way that doesn't feel forced or un-natural. 

If you are just a few colleagues looking for a great lunch spot, or if you are planning a work 5 a 7, I definitely think you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"We chose Addies for the previous reviews and it's location actually in the hotel where we are staying.   We arrived just after 6PM and were seated promptly.   We ordered our drinks and dinner and everything seemed pleasant.   Other people came into the restaurant and ordered just as we had.   After waiting ONE HOUR, we called our waitress and inquired about our food.  She told us it would be right up.   At one hour and 15 minutes, the people who were seated and ordered after us, got served their food.   I asked to see the manager and she tried to tell me that the orders were all turned in together.   When I explained to her that our order was given to the waitress BEFORE the table behind us, she did not apologize, offer anything and acted as if this was normal.   The food was good, when it finally came but by that time we were ready to leave and go somewhere else.   This is the first one star I have ever given."}
{"text":"We went there as a family on Sunday night and what an unfortunate disappointment.  The food was okay, but the service was exceptionally poor.  The waitress hardly ever paid attention to us (we attempted to order drinks for 45 minutes but then gave up completely.  See she adked if we needed a minute to look at drinks and we said yes and she chose to never come back). We skippeddessert too because waiting for her was annoying. Also, the other waitress could not speak a word of French, which is actually not allowed in Quebec and could get this place fined.  A couple was so upset that she couldn't understand them that they walked out and when they walked out and told our waitress, she hardly cared.  Overall, extremely bad service."}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch and it was nothing more than \"okay\". Food was food, nothing special, it was kind of overpriced although work was covering the cost so it didn't bother me. We were about 12 people and all of us agreed that we probably weren't going to be coming back again."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar for nearly an hour after ordering and eventually went to our server who told us there was a \"complication in the kitchen\" and that they would start making it now. 

The minute we entered the bar we were warned there was no alcohol at all and asked if we wanted to stay... not the warmest of welcomes. 

If I could select 0 stars for this place I would."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the service but I had the unpleasant experience of hearing what I assume was the manager, a large middle eastern man, having a yelling fit at his employees. It was embarrassing and I would never return to an establishment where people are treated like that. I can't imagine how some one like that is able to retain competent employees but as I said, somehow the service and food were 5 star."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service, restaurant wasn't even half full. Asked for steak medium-well, came out rare. Server didn't want to take it off the bill so I asked for the manager. She huffed and puffed at me and finally took it off. Then when leaving the restaurant all them employees were staring."}
{"text":"Un endroit parfait pour manger avant une game des Canadiens de Montréal. Le restaurant est pas trop loin à pied du centre bell, mais juste assez loin pour éviter une longue file d'attente comme dans les autres restos du coin. 

Nous avons seulement mangé les pelures de patates à la poutine et les rondelles d'oignons avec deux bières. Le service était très bon et la bouffe aussi :)

En conclusion, un bon petit restaurant pas trop cher pour casser la croute !"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend, at first we were a little worried that the  restaurant was in the front of a hotel.   Boy were we surprised, all the food is very reasonably priced, service was fast and very attentive.   The food, we ate the wings and the Philly poutine, both came out quickly and were so well tasting, those alone will bring us back. 

The wait staff met us at the door, immediately sat us, drinks came right away.   Overall I'm quite impressed with this gem.

Will add more on our second visit."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Best Western and went to Addies which is on the second floor of the hotel, we found the service and food to be excellent.  The potato and French onion soups were delicious. 

This place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Addies on our most recent trip to Montreal. We had dinner there and loved it so much we came back for lunch the next day.

The restaurant is attached to the Best Western Europa Hotel - where we were staying. There's also an entrance from the street though for non-hotel guests. We were surprised that it was so good and so reasonably priced.

For dinner I had the Greek salad with quinoa and avocado ($9) and I added grilled chicken to it for an extra $4. My husband had the Hotdog Royal ($10) which came with fries. He also had a pint of their Addies beer ($5.50).

My salad was huge and chock-full of fresh and colourful ingredients. It had mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, radishes, black olives, feta cheese, quinoa and avocado and red, yellow, orange AND green peppers, as well as grilled chicken. The dressing that I got on the side was a lemony vinaigrette. The salad was so good. They were so generous with all the ingredients. I was so full afterwards.

My husband's hotdog had bacon, cheese and caramelized onions on it. The hotdog was also huge and he got a lot of fries. I had some and they were awesome - hand cut, twice fried. 

For lunch, I had the Shrimp Tacos with a side salad $13 and my husband had the Crispy Maple Chicken $9.

I got 3 shrimp tacos. They were in a flour tortilla, full of good sized shrimp and pickled cabbage with a creamy cilantro sauce. The cilantro was not prominent. I'm not a huge cilantro fan but I didn't mind the sauce. The shrimp tasted fresh (not fishy/overly shrimpy). It came with a side of salsa which was fresh too (not from a jar).  My side salad was similar to the salad I had for dinner, just without the quinoa, avocado and chicken. Again, it was good.

My husband loved his Crispy Maple Chicken. It was basically chicken tenders on a waffle with some sprouts on top. He said he would drive from Ottawa to Montreal just for this dish. I had a bite and it was an awesome blend of sweet and salty, and crispy and soft. 

We had Sonia as our server both times and she was so sweet and nice. She was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu items and all around great. 

Decor is typical of a casual eatery. It's clean and nice. 

Addies is so much better than a lot of similar typed restaurants nearby, in my opinion, and so much cheaper. 

If we lived in Montreal we would definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Best Poutine I have ever had, fabulous Pizza, Service and Beer selection.

Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"So, as anyone would know, I visit Montreal only once a year, and it's only for a couple days.  So when I do go, poutine is a must for lunch and dinner.  

This year, instead of our regular Reuben's, we opted for the place right across the street from our hotel.  Since we're such fans of Chez Cora's, we thought, why not try Addies...

We were not disappointed.  In fact, it was so impressive that we're going to make this our regular stop every year on game night (yes, we also go for the Habs! GO HABS GO!!!  Pray they beat the Rangers and advance to the next round!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Anyway..  We were given a gameday menu.  A few things on there, but it was the poutine we go for, so poutine we got (and I got French Onion soup, really good, not the best, but up there).

I got the smoked meat poutine, my cousin go the pulled pork poutine..  I'm switching to pulled pork, cause that was OUT OF THIS WORLD Amazing good, I can't rave enough about it.

The place was really nice too, clean, upscale, looked like the kind of place you'd want to hang out at and catch a game.  Friendly staff, bar looked good.

So if you're like me and just visiting, or make it a regular stop, it's got this chef's recommendation!

(again GO HABS GO!)"}
{"text":"We decided to take a chance on getting a bite to eat after the first day of the three day race weekend; usually it's something we don't even try unless we have reservations but hitting some side streets to our Crescent and Rene Levesque location paid off as we came upon this great spot. 

First it's very clean looking, modern, service is very good and there are a couple little bonuses: they give you a bottle of water that comes with their name on it and you can refill at your own pace (small thing but good), the portions are very large, and they have good beer (their own). 

You do get a great deal for your dollar and I had a generous portion of poutine provencale, although seeing someone else's photo here they got what I only had a smidgen of - the peppercorns which makes the dish and knowing that now I'd be asking for more (hence 4 star not 5). My husband got the Hamburger Steak and it was exceptional.  On both cases the gravy was amazing. The key point is that the hamburger tasted like a great grilled steak.  The fries were as you expect for a good poutine and more than I could eat. I would have loved to fit more in but it was not going to happen. 

Now the prices - very very good at $9 for the poutine and the hamburger steak for $12.  Overall great place that now I'd put on my lust for our yearly trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"Ate here three times over a long weekend in Montreal. Everything we had was delicious, great service and reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best poutine I've had. Granted, I'm from the American South and currently live in Vermont but I've been around the poutine a time or twelve. The Bacon Poutine was absolutely divine. Service was stellar. My friend got a Caesar salad that was very good as well. Most def recommend."}
{"text":"Very Clean establishment! Service was great! Food was delish and affordable for a downtown joint! Only downside is that this restaurant closes too early, especially on a Friday . (They close at 11pm everyday) 

Their pizzas are delish, burgers are juicy, chicken wings were small but they give you 8 pieces which compensates... lastly, Im not a fry or poutine person and I loved my fries.... im actually considering trying their poutine next time Around!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for a show at the Bell Centre and with little time to spare, we decided to try Addies since it was nearby.

Attached the the Best Western Europa hotel, the restaurant doesn't look like much and could probably use a makeover but the food was good and very affordable. 

So, all in all I would recommend it and would go back if I was in a rush to get a bite before a show.  If I was looking for a nice place with ambience, I'd look elsewhere though."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went to this restaurant on the recommendation of the concierge at the Sheraton le centre Montreal. Really good food. And the desserts are amazing. For dinner we ordered the pepperoni pizza and ravioli pasta both very good. Dessert we had the smores in a jar and brownie caramel cookie sandwich. Both were very rich, but well worth it. We will return to this restaurant next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"So, a weak 3, but in fairness, it all depends on what you are looking for. We were visiting from the T. The reviews seemed okay - we were soooo hungry, possibly a bit light headed and wanting somewhere close walking distance and reasonable, and the menu looked promising... We popped over (even though the pics looked weirdly like a fancy cafeteria). The upside, the house beer was reasonable at 5.5 (downside, not a tasty craft beer). Shared 3 items: chorizo poutine, lots of curds and gravy and thinly sliced fried chorizo on top. Okay value. Next, the French onion soup, more like weak beef broth with an onion waved over it -not worth it and we didn't finish it.  Don't even bother with the fried chicken and waffle. Even though I was famished, I couldn't ignore that it tasted not unlike an eggo with 2 pinty tenders and Aunt Jemima syrup drizzled over it (if you've had a good chicken and waffle u won't want this). Overall, I felt I had to give 3 stars as they don't gouge you; however, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone visiting Montreal and looking for good food. I didn't mention the service - no, I didn't. It is the day after St. Patty's and I'm thinking they had a long day yesterday."}
{"text":"I casually strolled in here with my wife for a few drinks. We ended up ordering the hot dog royal. Omg that hotdog is so amazing, a hotdog filled with bacon, caramelized onions and melted cheese. Heaven on a platter!?!?!! Yes please"}
{"text":"Way too expensive and not that great of food. Nice if your staying at the Best Western and don't want to go far, but not much else great about it."}
{"text":"Food is about same, maybe simpler than the other bar/diner places in the area but prices are about 20-30% lower.

Hamburger steak tasted very Japanese with a little too much sauce but still fine.

Salmon filet was decently cooked, flakey but not over cooked. 

Caesar salad was with bacon bits.  Just about as normal of a Caesar salad as you can get. 

A little bonus point for the waitress warning us that the poutine was big and it's probably too much food if we order it."}
{"text":"I have some mixed reviews about Addie's. So I'm going to start with the positives because they outweigh the negatives. The restaurant is clean and located in the heart of downtown. The food is good , I really enjoyed their pulled pork poutine , it's a nice big portion and hits all the right notes without being too sweet or too spicy,  great sauce and they use cheese curds !:) us Montréalers know  a poutine that isn't made with squeaky cheese curds is not a true poutine ! Someone else had the French onion soup and Caesar salad and they said that was very good as well. We also ordered a pitcher of beer to share. Another good point is that while the resto was busy it wasn't very crowded so our group managed to get a table after work on a Friday no problem. They have lots of space so ideal for groups. The only issue was that our server , while very friendly was not very attentive and took a very long time to take our orders, check in on us , to bring our food and even to get and pay our bills...And the other thing was that the atmosphere was not as lively on a Friday night as what you might get elsewhere. BUT that is a also a Matter of preference there are those people that prefer it that way. All in all not a bad spot to get lunch or drop in for a beer and some food after work with friends or colleagues. The poutine is definitely a must order though !"}
{"text":"Superior food for a sports bar (especially if you are American and used to the poor quality pub food we've grown accustomed to). Tried 3 dishes, and all have been excellently prepared, and very wallet-friendly. From the starters : chicken wings (very crisp; dipping sauce has a kick; no bleu cheese dip; fresh side of vegetable sticks); & avocado tacos (served hot, multi-textured and flavored vs the cold, creamier version you're likely to get in the US). From the mains :  poutine provencale (au povre) - a large serving swimming in a generous, piping hot peppercorn sauce. Awesome, and probably the best poutine I've had so far (but more research is necessary)."}
{"text":"The Garlic shrimp linguini was an amazing dish at an amazing price, the shrimp was seasoned and grilled to perfection, the pesto kinda sauce on the linguini's was delicious!!! and hot dog royale, those caramelized onions- need I say more!!! Great atmosphere nice bar enjoyed very much"}
{"text":"Stopped in a for a couple of beers and an app or two.  

Place OK.  Prices were in line with the other pubs in town.

We opted out of the apps as we didn't see anything that looked that good.

I'd go back for dinner, some of the choices looked real good."}
