{"text":"We recently had an amazing catering experience for our 75 person party with Mykonos Grill. This was the first time we hosted such a large event and Peter clearly showed that his primary concern was the success of our party. He was extremely helpful, offering lots of tips on how to best serve and arrange the food with so many people, and never made us feel rushed anytime we stopped by or called with a question. The food was delivered on time and was a huge hit with our guests, everything was delicious! We've dined in the restaurant before as well and both the service and food were excellent. We couldn't recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"We had a staff lunch and I ordered the veggie wrap, no feta.  It was quite literally a wrap with a bunch of overly steamed carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.  NOTHING ELSE.  Feta would not have saved this.  It would be entirely possible to do a lovely grilled veggie wrap with some hummus, olives, lettuce, and grilled veggies,  I have had many.  Shocking that they have the nerve to charge $12 for this.  Better to just remove this travesty from the menu."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Mykonos almost accidentally and we are so glad we did.  We had a wonderful dinner. Everything was fresh and so flavorful. Of all the restaurants we visited during our stay, the people at Mykonos were the most friendly and showed us the greatest hospitality.     We felt so welcomed and would highly recommend Mykonos for locals and travelers alike."}
{"text":"Mykonos gets 4 starts off their trio dip option alone. I placed an order for delivery recently, and brought promptly to my door was the trio of dips (I chose tzatziki, tyrokafteri, and melizanosalata), and a gyro pita with side greek salad.   Oh those dips, so so good, and I don't know how it comes in the restaurant, but the take out had a very generous portion of feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, and cucumbers served alongside, as well as some warm yummy pitas.  I was expecting the melizanosalata to be more like a babaganoush, which its not at all.  It was my least favourite of the three, but that tyrokafteri was amazing.  So so good.  And there was enough dip and pitas for me to have it as a side for 3 different meals, and still some dip left to use on a sandwich for another meal.   The gyro didn't quite live up to the expectation the dips set.  The meat was dry, and it was cold.  And the veg in the greek salad wasn't very fresh.  But the gyro was enough for 2 very satisfyingly sized meals, it was a very generous serving.   I will return if for nothing else then that delicious tyrokafteri dip! Oh and the service on the phone was excellent, very friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to live near this neighborhood gem (though if I didn't I might be motivated to cook more). The food at Mykonos is fantastic - the best grilled calamari I've ever had. Portions are huge, and prices are super reasonable. The chicken fillet dinner can easily feed me for two meals. And most importantly, everything is delicious.   The service is also fantastic. The people who works there are so nice and happy to accommodate any special requests. I never want to move away from here!"}
{"text":"By far best Greek food in Toronto.  The portions are massive which is really what you want for Greek food.. You get so many options for sides too. Recommendations: calamari, chicken souvlaki, and the BURGER."}
{"text":"I confess I order delivery much more often than I stop in to eat. I suspect they do a brisk take out business. The quality, customer service and consistently good food keeps me coming back. My parents also love this place and always suggest it when they are in town visiting. It's unique in the Yorkville area as it feels down to earth and not over priced. The restaurant is very accommodating of special requests (like for my gluten-free friends). And best of all- my dog feels at home on their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Their tzatiki is ahhhhhhmazing. Ever since I moved out of the delivery range of this place, I've been in withdrawl. The pitas! So good! The service is always friendly and great as well.   One tip for fellow tzatiki lovers: you will smell like garlic for HOURS afterwards (in a good way), so make your friends and family eat the tzatiki too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrible experience.  An embarassment to Greek food. Poor food quality. Chicken souvlaki dinner contained 3 small pieces of chicken. . Large Greek salad was extremely disappointing. Contained 2 slices of cucumber and 2 tomato wedges.  Will never been eating from here again. If you are looking for Greek food I would think it is safe to go to any other restaurant than here. Really deserves a zero star rating."}
{"text":"This place has the worst greek fries I've ever had in my life: burnt, with barely any feta, no lemon, and hardly any seasoning. Everything in my order was gross. I would never order from them again."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for awhile and regret not doing it sooner.  Had something called fried cheese to start which was on fire and was delicious.  It was served with lots of toasted pita which was also delish.  Next to the chicken souvlaki dinner which was great and consisted of chicken/lemon potatoes/salad.  Pita was offered but I declined.  The meal was delicious but be warned to bring your appetite as portions are huge.  I was given a take out container so finished the rest for lunch the next day.   I was stuffed but have never been able to say no to chocolate so tried the flourless chocolate cake.  To die for (and a gluten free option for those who need it).  Overall very happy with the food and service.  Prices are very reasonable considering the portions.  Plan to call for delivery when next doing takeout."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery maybe 5 or 6 times in the last year. Always amazing. If you order on Justeat.ca and it says out of delivery district, just call the restaurant. They will deliver to you.  Best hummus ever. Creamy! It's a bit of an over kill on the garlic, they could lighten up in that department. you get tons of pita with it, enough for up to 6 people depending on appetite.   Portions are big, fresh and tasty. The lamb soulvaki cooked medium is great.  The village salad is worth the $3 upgrade. Its a meal in its self. Usually have it for lunch the next day, dont leave it more then 24 hours as it will start to sog. But pretty amazing that you can even leave it that long, usually salads flop after a few short hours."}
{"text":"My sister and her family were in town. Of course, it was great to see them and show them around but when it came to dining out, oy.   You see, my brother-in-law is a bit of a pain in the ass, er...I mean, a bit of a picky eater. Anything I consider interesting and tasty, he wrinkles his nose at because it's too pungent/funky/different/weird. You know what I'm talkin' about; every family has that one taste bud-challenged person who puts the kibosh on Thai/ Indian/ Korean/ Vietnamese-- basically, any vibrant cuisine with dishes that are hard to pronounce.  So when my sister said \"they\" (read: \"he\") found this restaurant near their hotel that they liked, I lowered my expectations and was prepared to be underwhelmed.  Maybe that's why I was so impressed by their choice in Mykonos. It's an attractive neighborhood restaurant with huge portions of fresh Greek food at beyond reasonable prices, served by what is possibly the Nicest Waitress in All of Canada.  We started with the Mezedakia Platter ($16) for the table: five homemade dips (tyrokafteri, melizanosalata, hummus, tzaziki, and taramosalata) served with olives and pita. Garlicky, bursting with flavor, just AMAZING. (And no, the brother-in-law did not partake in any of it. Too many Zs, Ks and vowels, I suppose.)  Next, we had heaping portions of super-fresh salads ($7), grilled calamari ($11), mussels ($10), salmon($16), souvlaki ($17). Delicious, but none of us was able to finish the mounds of food on our plates. (Except the B-I-L who stuck to a nice, safe Caesar salad.)   Mykonos wasn't crowded that night so the Nicest Waitress in All of Canada was able to dote on my niece and nephew, and make them laugh with the restaurant's 3-foot-long pepper mill. Heck, she made me laugh, too.  They have a crazy cheap wine list and their homemade desserts are a steal at $4 a pop.   I wouldn't go out of my way to dine at Mykonos but if I'm in the vicinity, I would definitely go back for the dips, grilled calamari, the NWiAoC, and the smug satisfaction that I can eat something more adventurous than a Caesar salad."}
{"text":"A friend and I dropped in with not much time to linger, so we both had only the grilled calamari and a glass of wine.  Both of us found the calamari it a bit rubbery, I would need to go back and have it again to see if it was just an off day.  There wasn't quite enough dip for the amount of calamari, so there was some dip-filching going on.  The decor is worth mentioning in that it seems to be informal with pleasing colours, clean and quiet.  But that peace was ruined by the presence of two large TVs that could not be escaped even though the sound was off.  Aside from that, I liked the feeling of the room and the friendliness of the staff.  Clearly this is family-owned, the best kind of restaurant.  Service was pleasant.  I did notice that when a little old lady asked for the rest of her dinner in a takeout box, no plastic bag was provided, and she was having trouble carrying the Styrofoam box in her small hand, with her cane and purse in other hand.  We didn't find it at all cheap, perhaps they have raised the prices lately as earlier reviews mentioned good value.  It was well over $20 each for that little bit of food and one glass of wine.  Jenny"}
{"text":"Pretty good greek. The lamb we had was a bit dry, but overall the meal was OK. The service was excellent, and they treated us very well."}
{"text":"Have been ordering from Mykonos for almost two years when we moved into the area.  We have never had a bad experience.  Peter, Kimberley, the entire staff are amazing and the delivery people are awesome too.   Food is always fresh and in good portions and most importantly extremely delicious.  Actually had them cater a family dinner last week and everyone was extremely happy with the food.  Great taste, portions, price,  service and fast delivery.   I am very particular about how my food is prepared and they get it right 100% of the time.   We order from here at least twice a week.   They go out of their way to make sure we are happy.  Big thumbs up to everyone at Mykonos."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant due to positive reviews on yelp but I found it to be just average in terms of the food. Service was very good on a slow Sunday though there was a lot of takeout activity. I had the lamb souvlaki with the greek salad. The lamb was good, there were a lot of vegetables which i would have preferred less of and more of the greek salad. Finished with baklava to give the restaurant the full greek test and was a little disappointed in that it was cold, obviously refrigerated which in my opinion/experience it shouldn't be. Next time i will try the pantheon based on a recommendation of a greek native living in TO."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food. We moved away from the area and my wife still sends me here for or Greek food whenever the feeling strikes. Clean restaurant and well kept. High quality food that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went to Mykonos today for the first time and I loved it.  Me and my friends shared the dip platter and it was delicious. Served with amazing pita bread and olives. Yum. I ordered a special - fish souvlaki with salman and cod and it was super good. The portion was also huge.  It is not the cheapest restaurant but it is also not over the top and in the end I don't mind paying a bit more when the food is that good."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and the reviews on Yelp made us curious.  Soooo glad we came in.  The food was SUPERB and the service was tops!  I have never done a Yelp review before but just had to share my appreciation and affection for this place!  This is not in my neighbourhood but I will be back!  Soon."}
{"text":"Great value for your dollar. More importantly the staff are so wonderfully kind and accommodating. My family and I have been regulars for years now.  It's a nice cozy place to dine in the winter, and in the summers we love to sit on their patio to people watch and enjoy a cool beverage.  I understand they are serving an authentic Greek menu, which means very rich dishes, however I'd love to see a few healthier options ie. gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, lower fat etc."}
{"text":"I got takeout food from Mykonos a few months ago after having gone to A Taste of the Danforth and this food was far superior to what we had in Greektown.   My girlfriend and I ordered two Greek salads with gyro with a side order of grilled calamari. The calamari was fantastic and stacked up with some of the best grilled calamari I've had in the city. It was perfectly spiced and grilled to perfection. The gyros were fantastic as well.   The salad was nice too but there wasn't enough dressing. Make sure to ask for extra or use the tzatziki.   Overall, I'd recommend the place for dine or takeout."}
{"text":"These guys have awesome customer service and are the only greek delivery I will ever call from now on! I still cant believe how above and beyond they go to make sure their customers are happy. Thanks again Mykonos!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. If you are looking quality, portion size, price and great service, I would reccomend! Peter is a very good manager!"}
{"text":"The best Greek I've ever had. Fresh and tasty, and always consistent.. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"just wow!  First time visit two days ago!  First time delivery tonight! Chicken souvlaki dinner yum! Pork souvlaki dinner char grilled to perfection, yummier!  Throwing caution to the wind and trying something i had never had...Tyrokafteri Spicy dip of grilled banana peppers and feta cheese ! OMG !!!! SO YUM!!! OPA!!!"}
{"text":"Standard greek fare- overpriced for what it is, in my opinion. Would prefer to go to one of the main places on the Danforth where the money really does return quality. Got the gyro dinner - first time trying gyro and was underimpressed and am quite sure gyro is supposed to taste better than that- unless it's supposed to taste like dry stale jerky-style snack. It looked like they left the gyro out long time that the outside became dry and hard and they just shed off those slices for me; wonder if inside it's supposed to be more full and moist. Husband got kalamari and it was good. But each meal roughly $20-23 when upgrade to greek salad... And i dont think the price justified the overall quality... Wont be coming back"}
{"text":"The food is great and reasonably priced. Restaurant atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. Staff is very friendly. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I got a small chicken souvlaki dinner ($16) and a large pork souvlaki dinner ($18). Both included very little meat. The pork souvlaki, being large, did not contain any more meat than the small chicken souvlaki. The dinner also included rotten broccoli, and roots of the vegetables. The quality of the food is simply unacceptable. I strongly advise that you stay away from this place, and of course I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sigh.  Had the lemon chicken rice soup, which was reasonably good, as well as the vegetarian moussaka. $6 for the soup, and $16 gets you the moussaka as well as 2 pitas and a side salad. However, the moussaka was the blandest I've ever had, so that by the third bite I had completely lost interest. Which was a shame, since I love moussaka and had been looking forward to it.  Disappointed overall. I'd wanted to like this little place, but at this point I'm not looking to return."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the Greek Salad and the Kalamari is grilled to perfection and so tasty! Always leave 100% satisfied. Have taken out and eaten in"}
{"text":"Delivery Review:  First time trying Mykonos.   Ordered delivery came within 40 minutes and in great shape.  Food was very tasty and the portions were good, except for the large chicken dinner 4 small pieces of chicken ($19)  Gyro was nice, despite it being later in the evening.   Would order again for sure."}
{"text":"Best gyros on a pita I've ever had, it was huge and delicious, the pita was nicely grilled and the gyro was just excellent,  Fairly priced, great lemon potatoes, decent delivery time via just eat,. Also had the fries as a side to the sandwich and they were delicious too, from frozen but their fryer oil, which they use for calamari and other delicious greek specialties imparts a wonderful favour to the fries that is hard to describe but makes them really tasty. Ill definitely order again."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Mykonos Mediterranean Grill this evening and we were both blown away by the quality of food that we received.  We ordered the regular sized chicken souvlaki dinner (8 oz. of chicken, steamed mixed veg., rice and potatoes), Greek salad, taramasalata and tiropita.   The chicken was tender, tasty and juicy! The portion sizes not too big, just right. Taramasalata was smooth, creamy and delicious.  Tiropita was still nice and warm, with a soft cheese filling and a perfectly golden and flakey phyllo pastry shell.   The ordered arrived in just over an hour and the food was all fresh!  I would definitely order from Mykonos Mediterranean Grill again and highly recommend if you desire authentic, delicious and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Mykonos. It's a Greek island, a pretty Fleet Foxes song and a restaurant in Toronto on Yonge close to Davenport.    I agree with the Yelp community--get your Greek delivery here!  Fast, FRESH and mighty tasty. Decent value too.   Comes with extra hot pita.  Delivery is available if your order is $20 or above. No extra delivery fee if you order via Just-Eat and there is a $2 fee if you order directly with the restaurant.  It may be quicker to order directly if you don't mind the small fee."}
{"text":"On New Years Day, I ordered a souvlaki dinner for myself and my girlfriend. Thankfully, without having to wait too long, the delivery dude showed up with my order of large souvlaki chicken dinner and my girlfriend's small pork souvlaki dinner.   My first reaction upon opening my food was \"Ooh, I think they messed up the sizes.\" Even though I had ordered the large one, my girlfriend's plate had more food (meat, rice and veg) in it. All the contents in the bowl were identical. However, we are really comparing apples and oranges, so I am not sure if the folks at Mykonos messed up or not. My review of the food in general is that it's pretty good for a delivery food. I think the plus was that they used the breast meat for the chicken, yet manage to not make it completely dry. It was pretty juicy and I think they had just enough amount of char on the outside for my liking (i.e. not a lot). The veggies and potatoes were pretty much standard affair. Veggies were nothing to write home about, and I was just glad that potatoes were not entirely bland. I liked the salad that they packed for its dressing. The salad itself looked kinda sad. Reminded me of those garden salad mixes you buy at Loblaws. I tend to like dressings with strong vinegar smell, and this one had that. I was really hungry, so I was able to finish the whole thing, but if I was not as hungry, I think I would not have been able to finish. I think the portion was generous (save for chicken), and I think over all, the food earns a solid 3.5/5  My girlfriend (a big fan of Greek food) enjoyed the food, but I think she also finds the food little shy of being comparable to other Greek food that she has had. She did not like the sourness of the potatoes, but she thought the other parts of the food were done pretty well.  She did not end up finishing her meal (because of the portions), but she was satisfied. She agrees with me that in terms of the food quality, this place would be like 3.5/5.   Overall, this place gets a solid 3.5 from me. In fact, if the delivery was a bit quicker, I would have rated this place 4/5."}
{"text":"I came for dinner and had the gyro on a pita. ..omg it was HUGE!  I was thinking it would be something small!  And i wad looking at my friends' portions and they were huge too.  Prices are good for what you get"}
{"text":"Good quality food and presentation. I would order from here again. I got the chicken sticks and a salad and hummus."}
{"text":"My friend Stephanie introduced me to this neighborhood gem in the chi-chi downtown area bordering Rosedale/Yorkdale.  It's a tidy, comfortable eatery. Warm and without pretension, the service cultivates regulars while the food is spectacular enough to raise eye brows on first bite.  Had then grilled calamari salad which was succulent and generously portioned, perfectly done ($10). The hummos was creamy yet light and the babaganoush was fresh, with almost a salsa texture.   This was better than a lot of the food I'd had in Greektown."}
{"text":"Ask for the flamed cheese (saganaki), surprise people at other tables (some would jump) while you contemplate the fire and the cute waitress screams: Opa!!! The most fun dish I've had this year.  The saganaki was accompanied with a thin spiced bread and a glass of red wine (lucky me).  I just met a dish that incorporates fluffy potatoes, cheese, ground (amazingly) seasoned-tasty beef, with a fresh salad; it's name: Moussaka. It's going to be in my top 10 for potato dishes (I'm a fan).  The service was fast. The waitress was charismatic, gorgeous, with a big genuine smile; she made excellent recommendations, and showed quite a skill and braveness when she performed the cheese trick, Opa!  I almost forget to recommend the flaky bread stuffed with feta. Try it if you are into salty pastries, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the family - beyond impressed with Mykonos. 3 orders of calamari, and every piece large and grilled to perfection. Salads fresh just right amount of feta. Lamb and moussaka very well made and all portions are quite satisfying. Great price point and will order again."}
{"text":"Wow this place is da bomb.    Ambiance: It's casual, but not too casual like a greasy spoon.  It seems like it can be a great place for a casual date or even a going away party for a co-worker.  They also have a nice patio, but it faces Yonge St with tonnes of cars.    Service: Waitress was friendly, but I found the wait slightly long.  Just over 15 minutes for my food during lunch time. Might have been 20.  Don't remember but I didn't want to go back to work anyways. Not a big deal.   They also gave me free bread.  It was quite tasty and I was able to eat it without dipping it in hummus or tziki. Kind of wish I had some though. :-(   Food: I ordered the mousaka, which is basically ground beef, eggplant, some other veggies and spices in between mashed potatoes? (at least that's what I thought it was).  It was delicious.  It's basically like a Greek version of Sheppard's pie but with slightly more kick, and I would say more sophisticated.  It also came with a fresh salad but it was slightly bland and I guess that helps offset the flavour explosion of the mousaka,  Price: $17 is slightly pricey for the mousaka and salad but I was so stuffed afterwards.  I would say it's worth it, and a great once in a while treat.    Verdict: I will be back and recommend to my co-workers for any company outings (birthday lunches, going away dinners, Christmas lunches, etc.)."}
{"text":"Ordered take out pick up on the way home from here last night and wanted to try a new place. Great Greek classics. Ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner large up change to village greek salad, lamb souvlaki dinner, and calamari appetizer. Dinners were good size and chicken and lamb was nicely marinated and not dry. Pita on the side was a little dry I think they grill it. They put the tzaziki inside the dinner so beware if you're warming the whole foil container in warming drawer in oven. Had to warm the calamari up and the fried coating fell off too easily. I ordered pick up so don't know if it would be good for delivery. Overall good greek restaurant if you're in the mood for some classics in this area."}
{"text":"Named after a beautiful Aegean island, Mykonos is a little Greek oasis west of the danforth, located near Rosedale station.   I've never been inside, so I hesitate to recommend dining (based on other reviews, I'm sure you can see it's quite highly rated). However their delivery is phenomenal: fast, hot, delicious, and stuffed with fluffy extra pita and tzatziki.  We've ordered the grilled calamari, the veggie moussaka, the mezedakia trio, and the saganaki. All dishes are delicious. Here's some quick advice for takeout/delivery:  First: they come fast, so don't be literally caught with your pants down, and get dressed as soon as you put your order in. Maybe be dressed as you make the call, I don't know, I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life!  Second: if you're tolerant of lactose, you should always get the saganaki, because theirs is incredible, and it's just as good the next day or even the day after. Watch your reheating times though: it melts quick. Definitely do NOT try to set your cheese on fire at home, kiddos - leave it to the pros.  Third: The \"Kalamari Dinner\" is good, comes with a few potatoes and some veggies (which are indeed tasty), but I personally find that the calamari \"Hot Meze\" is better value. It just comes with Tzatziki, but will save you 6 dollars.  Fourth: The moussaka is huge and dense. Even if you're really hungry, it's a pretty full meal on it's own (You should still get the saganaki though, duh.)"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant with good size servings and a decent variety on the menu. Best humus in town. If you have a sweet tooth you must try the baklava. Best baklava I have ever had in my life. Photo shows the baklava. I was so hungry I forgot to take a photo of the main course. Next time I will. I go there often."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I have had lots of Greek dinners but my friends and I all agree best chicken dinner in the city.   Remember to up grade your salad to Greek.   The soft drinks are bottomless so drink up :)  The portions are huge so go with a healthy appetite  And our server was amazing ( and really pretty)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious however, delivery took over an hour and was definitely over priced. Half way through our meals my wife found a staple in her potatoes and I found a broken toothpick in my gyro! For such a pricey meal I would expect the quality to have been perfect but even the chicken was charred! Better luck next time I guess!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Great friendly service and good food. I can't believe there weren't more people here on a Saturday night but it sits sort of by itself short walk from more populated neighborhoods. The Lemon rice soup was best we've ever had! Very affordable."}
{"text":"My BF and I were craving Greek food for lunch on a muggy rainy day in July. We were let to Mykonos thanks to Yelp.  Our food was hot and fresh, just as other reviewers have pointed out through their experiences. We ordered a tryokafteri dip to share as an app and I loved it! If you have never tried this spread before and enjoy spicy things, I recommend it! It is a smooth, creamy dip consisting of grilled banana peppers and feta cheese. They served the dish with hot grilled pita wedges, OMG so good!!  I really enjoyed the Greek lemon soup I ordered, very tasty! Loved the village salad as well, super fresh veggies and a hunk of tangy, salty feta on top. My BF enjoyed his chicken souvlaki dinner, it was a great portion size.  Our server was very attentive and personable. Since there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant when we visited, we ended up having a group discussion about various topics. I really liked the vibe and we will be back.  Try the Greek beer called Fix with your meal, its great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great authentic Greek food that is reasonably priced. In from L.A. for business and felt like a good Greek dinner. Checked out the Yelp reviews and found Mykonos. We took an Uber from the Fairmont Hotel and walked into an empty restaurant at about 8:30pm on a Friday night. I wasn't really worried as the reviews were so good I felt that there must be a good reason for the place being deserted. I was told by our waiter Nick that the Raptor game had everyone staying home to watch on tv. As a result their take out was booming but we were the only 2 guests the entire time we were their.   Peter the owner took good care of us and suggested an assortment of dips that we agreed to.  He also suggested that we order chicken souvlaki, we did and they both were fantastic. Large and delicious portions. We couldn't even finish the entree; just too much!!! If I lived in Toronto I would be a weekly regular.   A great find that I highly recommend. Shoutout  to the owner Peter for making 2 out of town'ers feel so at home."}
{"text":"I am really sorry but this place was one of the worst Greek restaurants ever!!!Fried calamari were beyond greasy and soggy..surprisingly when you order a dinner plate you dont get a greek salad??You get some greens and if you want greek salad,you  have to pay 5 bucks extra??!!Grilled calamari were ok..pita bread was extremely oily and burnt,..tzzazziki sauce was very salty..etc.. I will never visit this place again..."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a restaurant in an area that lacks nearby shopping and other restaurants. I have been going here for about three years now, and it is my go-to for Greek food. I have dined in, have ordered take out, and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality. It trumps the Greek restaurants on the Danforth where I find the food can often be too salty and oily.  The food is delicious and the customer service is great. My favourite dish is the village salad (big fresh chunks of peppers, cucumbers, onions, feta, and olives) topped with either grilled chicken, grilled calamari, or grilled shrimp. The grilled calamari is one of the best I have had, but you really can't go wrong with any of the three! The chicken souvlaki is also great. Even the small size is quite large, so if you order the regular size, be prepared to bring home leftovers! My friend ordered the Greek chicken wrap for take-out and it was massive - like two meals in one! I also really enjoy the complimentary grilled pita they give you as an appetizer topped with olive oil and garlic (they also provide this with all take out and delivery orders). It is especially yummy dipped in their hummus.  In addition to the quality of the food, the prices are fantastic! Especially given that within a five minute walk from the restaurant you will pay twice the price for half of the food. The owners and servers are very kind and more than willing to accommodate you and your dietary preferences (I don't like the olives or feta with my village salad). It is definitely a family-friendly restaurant and I am always impressed that they remember my favourite orders. You don't come here for the ambiance as it is more of a homestyle restaurant, but you come for the food and service!"}
{"text":"While it has been a few months since I last visited Mykonos Mediterranean Grill, I feel that I owe this neat little treasure hidden near Rosedale station a fair review.   Quick summary for readers in a hurry: MMG is definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Toronto that falls within medium price range ($15-30). Their menu consists of many authentic Greek dishes that will be more than enough to satisfy your appetite with their fresh and well cooked ingredients in a surprisingly large quantity.  The best thing that I noticed about Mykonos Mediterranean Grill during my last three visits was that, regardless of how hungry I was, I always came out with a full stomach and more. While I do prefer to go to restaurants that fall within a cheaper price range, I never held myself back from going to Mykonos, because I knew it would be as though I am getting more than what I paid for.   As a general introduction to the restaurant, Mykonos is a cosy Greek place located near Rosedale station on Yonge Street. They seem to get a lot of returning customers who belong to the right extreme of generation (in terms of age), though you will see younger customers dropping in briefly for a pickup (they have a delivery service as well). The restaurant's indoor is a dimly lit space with a warm, greeting atmosphere that gives it a family-owned business type of look. Waiters and waitresses are very friendly and will respond enthusiastically to newcomers to the restaurant or Greek cuisine in general. In addition, the service is quick and customers will feel well-acknowledged by their servers.   Now, the most important part - the food! On my first visit, my friend and I ordered kalamari to share between the two of us, and a Santorini Chicken for the main course. I actually order kalamari every time I make a visit to the restaurant, so I think my opinion on it is rather obvious. To elaborate, the squid is cooked perfectly so that it's not too chewy or has a rubbery texture, and it's also not as greasy as something you'd get from a restaurant of lower standard. The part of the dish that will truly win your taste buds' heart is the dipping; it is creamy, zesty, and has that refreshing flavour that will counterbalance the greasiness that comes with any fried food.   The two main course items that I ordered from Mykonos were Pork Souvlaki and Santorini Chicken. The latter was not as impressive as the souvlaki, as it was a little too salty for my preference. However, the chicken was tender and moist, and I definitely enjoyed the potatoes (albeit anti-salty eaters should be wary of it) and the house salad that came as a side. As for the pork souvlaki, it is seasoned to perfection, and it is fantastically moist and flavourful. The sides were the same as the chicken, with an addition of rice, which was rather mediocre.   As much as I would love to give this friendly, stomach-filling restaurant a five star rating, there is one thing that holds this restaurant just one star back from being perfect. While the main stars of their dishes are very well made, the unnecessary diversity and quantity of the sides often make me scratch my head. For example, the rice they use as a side to souvlakis feel as though they are within the same league as precooked, microwavable fried rice. The vegetables and the rice are overcooked, the flavours are blend and dull, and the texture lies between a solid food and mashed potatoes. The unfortunate thing is that these low-grade extra sides often distract the customers from enjoying the main stars of their dish. By the time they have gone through the sides on the dish, the remaining \"goodies\" will have to be stuffed down their throat, down into their already-full stomach.   In conclusion, I would most definitely recommend this restaurant to people coming from any specific groups that range from Greek food lovers to simply starved individuals. While I am confident that everyone will enjoy most of the things on their dishes, I would like to advise against eating majority of the sides before finishing the main focus of the dish. You can eat house green salad and vegetables + rice from any low-to-medium grade restaurants, but you will have a tough time finding souvlakis and other Greek favourites as fresh and flavourful as those offered at Mykonos!"}
{"text":"Pros: Large portions, delicious potatoes, Santorini chicken was flavourful and stuffed with a nice amount of feta and spinach   Cons: Moussaka was awful! I love moussaka but this one went straight in the garbage. It tasted like burnt veg and what I imagine wallpaper paste to taste like. So disappointing. Spring mix \"salad\" is literally just spring mix... no other vegetables."}
{"text":"Whenever i need my greek food fix which was rare i used to head off to the Danforth and always expect some hit and miss cuisine with a side of bad attitude. UNTIL I found this amazing restaurant hidden on Yonge Street.  I was in Yonge and Bloor and wanted Greek food which is rare because i was never a fan of the food after being fed bad rice, overcooked and underseasoned Souvlaki on the Danforth.  Found this restaurant order the Pork Souvlaki dinner wow wow wow meat properly seasoned, cooked to perfection melts in your mouth and comes with baby greens dressing was delicious. I order mine with fries just general preference again fresh and cooked great no soggy or overcooked fries here.  Both me and the wife have been coming back here ever since, we order it for delivery and go and have a meal there as well. The food is always consistent and delicious.  PLEASE try the hummus you will not be disappointed.  The service is amazing Peter makes you feel so welcome in his restaurant and is extremely tentative to your needs.   I hope this places takes all the business from the Danforth!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been doing some work nearby and have been tempted by the delicious smells coming from this place so I had to try it. I ordered a small gyros dinner, one of my favourite Greek dishes.  What I got was a heaping plate of food that included rice, potatoes, salad, and steamed veggies, with a whole pita on the side. Wow! What does the large look like? I can't fault them for portion size.  While the flavours were good, the beef and lamb gyros was sliced from a pre-formed cone of ground meat, standard at most Greek restaurants. Good, not great. Maybe I've been spoiled by the hand made layers of meat I've been having at the other Greek restaurants I've been going to. Perhaps I'll try their souvlaki next time."}
{"text":"Rating 2.5  Too lazy to cook, I decided to order a small Chicken Dinner for takeout. Here is my meal and my thoughts: - Chicken brochette: While it tastes fresh it was missing some zing - Rice: Taste good, but felt like it was sitting around for a while - Green salad: meh - Potatoes: Ok - Tzaziki: GREAT but why so little?  I am willing to give this place another try just because the quality/price ratio is worth it."}
{"text":"Gyros are AWESOME here. Tzaziki is tart, fresh and thick. Perfect for dipping with grilled pita bread. Servings are big and you get your money's worth. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly and explained the dishes well for one of my coworkers that was unfamiliar with Greek cuisine. They also gave us a complimentary sampler platter. One of my favourite Greek spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Yum! This place was so delicious! The serving sizes are massive for what you pay, the hummus is delicious & obviously freshly made there, and the seasoning that they use are spot on! We loved that the pepper came in such a huge grinder (it was seriously half my height) & it was so fresh & delicious! It really pulled together all of the flavors & added a nice touch to our dish. The staff was so friendly & accomodating, and the inside was very cozy! The service was fast & efficient, and we had a very nice time here. So nice in fact that we couldn't stop raving about the food. For a week after that, all we could cook was Greek food. We started following a traveler on Instagram who frequented Greece, and we loved to see pictures in the restaurant & on Instagram. This place actually caused a nice change for us :) we ended up loving it so much, and it fueled our passion for Greek food, that we bought tickets to Greece a week later & stayed in Athens! So happy we went here :)"}
{"text":"Mykonos is one of \"must go\" places when in Toronto. Cozy atmosphere with caring staff. The owner is always there, attentive and friendly. The lamb shank with lemon potatoes and veggies along with warm pita and yummy tzaziki is my favourite."}
{"text":"FOOD. QUALITY. SERVICE. AUTHENTICITY. VALUE. Will definitely be back, it's a healthy affordable place to enjoy many Greek options :)"}
{"text":"One of the best salad I've had in a while. I added calamari to it and omg it was amazing! I got it delivered and It came piping hot and didn't lack any flavour. I've been ordering with this restaurant for a while now and they've always had fresh food. Try this place out!!! There Greek food is good too and they have a good delivery system!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner.  We were treated like special guests by our waiter who went out of his way to make our Greek dining experience one we will not forget.  After being directed to a good bottle of Vino, we tried the Tyrokafteri appetizer.  It was delicious!!  The waiter then brought out some eggplant to supplement the Tyrokafteri explaining that it changes the taste a bit and encouraged us to try adding some.  Very nice.  Knowing that our appetizer itself was a decent portion, he encourages us to share an entrée and recommended a few.  We went with the Santoriini Chicken (yum) and Greek salad (basic).  He then offered us each a taste of Retsina, a unique Greek wine, wanting to expose us to Greece.  I commented that unfortunately, I had no room for dessert.  He asked if we had ever had Greek desserts.  I told him yes, we had had Baklava.  Again, it seemed he wanted to open up our Greek experience and brought us a complimentary piece of Galaktoboureko, a phyllo and custard concoction that was truly delectable.  Fortunately we were able to choose to walk the 3 miles back to our hotel as we had to burn off some of this fabulous meal.  What a great, personalized, quaint experience dining here."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place did alright.  Met up with a friend here who works around the corner and we lunched and we lunched well.  The wrap I got was a little hard to handle but it tasted good. A little hard on the Feta but still good.  Service was quick a courteous, didn't push hard on anything and met all of our needs.  Overall, good, not great, but I had a good time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner. Tried the chicken souvlaki.  I placed the order at 6pm and it arrived just a few minutes shy of 7:30. That was really too bad for me because it was really important for me to eat by 7:30. I only had 3-4 minutes to eat. I thought that placing the order at 6 meant it would be there around 7 at the latest but I wish I had placed my order sooner. I called the restaurant after the first hour or so of waiting and he told me about circumstances beyond their control that had ended up backing up all of their delivery orders. He explained and apologized. He said mine was on the way and about 20 minutes later it arrived. The delivery driver did not apologize he just thanked me.  Placing the order, the man on the phone was nice and very efficient. He obviously takes a lot of orders and he tries to make the process fast and easy for you.   I enjoyed my dinner but to be honest, it wasn't so good that I was able to look past the super delay in delivery and the lack of an apology from the driver. I'm not saying it was his fault and I know he was probably having a stressful night, but I was surprised he didn't mention anything to me after I had been waiting for so long. But I think I could have overlooked all of it and chalked it up to a bad night if the food had completely blown me away. It wasn't as good as some other Greek restaurants I have tried. So, I won't personally be a returning customer for delivery or in restaurant again. Everything was good but nothing was great- the pita was good but slightly charred/burnt (or is that how people like it?) the chicken and tzatziki was good, the salad was pretty good as were the rice and potatoes. Portions were generous. I couldn't finish the meal and I was full.  I know for sure that there are better Greek restaurants, and there are better delivery experiences and I mean that in terms of taste and value as well. When I read through Yelp reviews, a lot of people were impressed with how fast it came and some people were disappointed for how slow delivery was. Too bad my first experience wasn't a great one and the food didn't quite make up for it."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the area and decided to stop by this place for lunch. The menu looks simple, but is quite extensive. The atmosphere is very casual and has a nice feel to it. The service was nice and quick. The lady that took our orders was very friendly and checked up on us every once in a while, but not enough to interrupt our conversation which was very nice.   Finally, the food. I was very hungry, so going in I knew I was going to get something with a side of Greek salad. I opted for the chicken souvlaki sandwich, as you can never go wrong with grilled chicken, fresh veggies and of course, tzatziki sauce! My friend decided to go \"light\" with a Greek salad with grilled shrimp on top. We were also given an appetizer on the house, which was some sort of grilled pita dipped in garlic-flavoured oil I think (I could be totally wrong).  When our server went past our table with two gigantic plates, I was really happy they weren't for us...or so I thought. She turned back and put them down on our table. I looked at my friend with my jaw dropped and said there was no way I was going to finish my food...and I didn't. Not because it wasn't delicious, but it was simply too big of a portion. The chicken was grilled to perfection and the tzatziki was delicious! The Greek salad wasn't anything special to be honest and not really worth the extra 3$, but it was a healthier option compared to the usual side of fries.   Overall, the experience was good at this restaurant: the food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly and the ambiance was pleasant."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy it that much. Large portions but the quality wasn't there. I had the chicken Souvlaki and the chicken wasn't that tender. Felt a bit rubbery. Appetizers were alright but wouldn't go back there. Much better places else where in the area especially given the prices."}
{"text":"Got this as one of my OT dinner - their chicken is very moist and tasty. I'm so surprised their meat is very moist in general. Great food! Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"So amazing! Was in Greece last summer and the food is so comparable! Amazing service too they delivered 20 minutes before their expected time delivery! Will definitely be ordering more often from Mykonos. Way better than every other Greek delivery we had and same quality as Danforth! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a quick bite with a couple of colleagues, and this place looked inviting. The patio here is really comfortable and convenient for those that work or go to school nearby - great place to grab some food while also catching some sun. There's a few large umbrellas also, for those that prefer the shade.  Was pretty impressed with this place. The food was pretty efficient for an actual sit down Mediterranean place - we were able to order, get our food, and eat in about 40 minutes. The server was friendly and made sure to check up on us periodically.  The \"Pork Pita\" I ordered was a bit fatty, but tender, with lots of sauce. The fries were crispy, and might have been freshly cut. Pretty good value for about $10. Unlike some places downtown, the server didn't mind that we did not order mid-day drinks, and happily brought us water with lemon. My colleagues ordered wraps, which were HUGE - I'll have to try this next time.  Will definitely be back here. 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The lamb is NOT tender- hard to chew.   The pita looks like something they get from No Frills and then just put grill marks on it- making it taste stale by the time you get it.  The salad is just one kind of green with oil- no cheese, no mixed ingredients of anything.  The one star I give them is for the potatoes.  The potatoes as good.  That is it.  Oh and verrrrrry overpriced. Especially for the crap it tastes like."}
{"text":"I really like Mykonos. It's a family restaurant and the people that work there are super nice and love to share stories with you. I had the pork souvlaki. The platter was overwhelmingly huge! I couldn't finish everything. The souvlaki was good, but could use a tad more seasoning. I also ordered Taromasalata, which is my absolute fav. The Taro was delicious. I would definitely visit here again if I'm in town. Next time I'll get the squid."}
{"text":"As advertised. Started with a glass of Greek wine. Comfortable, low key, with good daily specials. Got the Village salad w/chicken (nice and well seasoned). Kalimanta Olives were good and salty, and the Tzatzikii had a nice little kick. Service was very good ."}
{"text":"Friend reccomended we hit mykonos up so what the hell. first thing, if your going here, get the dips, the damn dips are so damn good. they are made fresh in house each and every single day and will literally make the dinner. had the calamari grilled which was pretty nice with the village salad which was Good except the chef chops the veggies weird so the plating is pretty but just overall kind of hard to eat, involves alot of cutting away whereas i would much rather be eating away. service was quick and they have a patio. get the dips"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time by placing an order for delivery on justeat.ca. The delivery was kind of slow but when I called the restaurant to complain they were more than willing to compensate the slow service the next time I placed an order through them directly. I probably will just call direct to order next time instead of using justeat.ca.  I was quite happy with the friendly customer service they offered. The food was excellent and so I will definitely be ordering from them in the near future as well as dining in the restaurant.   Highly recommend if you're a Greek food lover like me !"}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery and never eaten in the dining room, so my review is based on their take out menu.   I have tried several Greek restaurants and always find myself coming back to Mykonos! Their portions (with the exception of the chicken in their Souflaki dinners) are quite generous and the quality of the food is very good. I am especially fond of their Greek fries and tsatziki.   Not the cheapest but overall very good. The delivery man and restaurant staff on the phone are all very friendly. Delivery is almost always on time or faster than expected."}
{"text":"I normally order take out from here which is delicious - only thing you may not like is that they add steamed veggies to souvlaki dinners.  However, my last order took veggies way too far. Our salad was full of them (which I like)--- but in chunks (which I don't like). Literally they were cut in hunks and halves. I had to slice then into bit size portions!?Take out means avoiding cooking and yet they gave me a do it yourself salad.  Ps the souvlaki was a bit dry and charred too."}
{"text":"We had catering ordered today for 25 people for a corporate lunch.  Everyone raved about how tasty everything was.  We will definitely be ordering from you again.  Peter was a pleasure to work with, he knew exactly how much food was needed.  Thanks again"}
