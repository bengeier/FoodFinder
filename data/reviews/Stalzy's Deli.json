{"text":"I have been itching to try Stalzy's since it opened a few years ago, but somehow never got around to it. Until yesterday. 

I shouldn't have bothered. 

My sister and I stopped in for lunch around 11:30 on Sunday. The place seemed fairly slow at the time. It had a hip, relaxed vibe that I immediately liked. The person who took care of us was very friendly, and, when both of us ordered the Reuben, happily informed us that Stalzy's was famous for that particular sandwich. I noted the meat slicer being put to use behind the counter: this is going to be GOOD, I thought to myself. 

This must be REALLY good if it takes this long to make a Reuben sandwich, I thought to myself 30 minutes later when our orders had not yet arrived. Just past the 40-minute mark, we began looking around the (still sparsely occupied) dining room in bewilderment, trying to catch anyone's eye to see if perhaps our order had been forgotten. Finally, I heard a bell ding: sure enough, our anxiously awaited sandwiches made their way to our table. 

My sister noted the smell of bacon. I bit in and surmised that the meat was heavily smoked. Not only was it horrifically salty, but the smoky flavor was overpowering and did, in fact, result in meat that tasted somewhat more like beef bacon than corned beef. Further, although the meat was sliced ultra-thin, it was tough and chewy. 

But the worst insult came when I took apart the sandwich...and gagged. I have NEVER seen so much globulous, disgusting fat in one sandwich (see photo). As a person who assiduously trims most (if not all) of the fat off her meat before consumption, I was completely nauseated. 

So there you have it: two bites and DONE. Easily the WORST Reuben sandwich I've ever tasted in my life. In retrospect, we should certainly have sent the sandwiches back, although I did not want, under ANY circumstances, to find out what ELSE Stalzy's might be \"famous\" for. Since the sis and I were also now in a hurry, we didn't want to wait around any more. 

We hit up the nearest fast food restaurant and called it a day.

I wouldn't go back to Stalzy's on a BET. 

GROSS."}
{"text":"This is way better than Ella's deli. The price and portions are about the same but the quality/freshness is far superior."}
{"text":"Sorry about this as I have been here before with good results, nothing fabulous,but good. However, my 2 recent visits were not so.
I loved the Rachel Sandwich, but on late Saturday Aft I waited almost 30 minutes ( no,wasn't crowded) and when it arrived,I hardly recognized it. Very dry pastrami,ends leather like and bread so over grilled it hurt my gums. Tuna melt,that same day was not even finished by my friend, just blah. A couple weeks later for lunch,on a weekday,,our burgers were dry and buns not very fresh. 
Odd when you order at the front, they turn the computer to you and it asks you for a tip amount. For what? Someone brings your plate out? I had get myself a menu,get up to order, and pick out my own drinks. 
Love the nostalgia of the place and friendly staff. But,
Floor is getting pretty gross looking guys."}
{"text":"I recently made my first trip to Stalzy's and I found that while I got a tasty meal, Stalzy's did not live up to the hype.  The service was great and the decor looked like what you would expect for a neighborhood deli.  Stalzy's even has a small shop area where they sell their housemade meats and bread.  Bring your wallet though, because none of the items are cheap.  Now on to the meal.  I am a huge Reuben fan, so I had to get one.  I ordered a Brooklyn Reuben that had pastrami instead of corn beef.  I was a little disappointed when the sandwich came.  I was expecting a sandwich so high, I would not be able to fit it in my mouth.  I was thinking this sandwich would be like something you would get in an NY deli.  I paid almost 13 dollars for the meal, potato salad included, and left hungry.  The sandwich was tasty and the only complaint I had with it was that is was a bit salty.  The punchline: Good sandwiches, but bring your wallet and not your appetite."}
{"text":"I had the roast beef sandwich and it was really delicious. I would have given it 5 stars, but the wait was really long. I hate watching a larger group of people, who arrived after me, get served before me..."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim one evening, and I am so glad I did! Here's why:

1. Every staff member I interacted with, from the fellow who took my order to the woman who brought me my sandwich, was particularly warm, gracious, and friendly.

2. The BLT I ordered was darn good. It's hard to mess up a BLT, but also hard to make one that's actually memorable, as mine was. 

3. They offer a variety of interesting sides beyond the standard chips or fries. I ordered the pickled beets, which were not technically pickled, but rather fresh beets dressed in a flavorful vinaigrette. 

4. While I was waiting for my food, I was offered a free sample of some tasty beef and, even more unexpectedly, red wine!

5. The atmosphere is cozy--I felt comfortable sitting alone and leisurely enjoying my sandwich, and I saw someone else drinking coffee and doing homework like you might in a coffeeshop. But there were also small groups, and I think it would be a great place to meet someone for a casual meal.   

I will definitely be back to try some more of their offerings, including the deli side of things!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had so far has been tasty, well-portioned (if not huge), all with great service. Deli meats sliced to the right thickness, breads are well-made. Latest was the PBLT (pastrami, bacon, lettuce, tomato) The bacon was their house, double-smoked and delicious...pastrami lightly grilled, fresh tomato, very filling with a side of creamy macaroni salad.

Wish I still live din the neighborhood - great needed deli for Madison."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  This place is a winner!  Best Brooklyn Reuben ever, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Cash only joint, don't worry they have an atm there and will give you a $1 off your order if you present your receipt.  If you're into cure meats and homemade everything, this is a great choice.

Update:  food is still great and I love coming in here for the pastrami.  The last few times in though the service has been slooooowwwwww.  We also had a burger the last time around, don't.  Stick with the Pastrami."}
{"text":"The only decent deli in town.

Now I'm talking Jewish Deli - for Italian Deli there's always Ginos, Frabonis, etc.  But for Jewish Deli, nothing comes close.

I'm from the Detroit Area, where we have a large Jewish population.  Great delis.
I've been to NYC many times.  Great delis (Carnegie is ok, Katz's is mind blowing).
Madison, not so much. 

Living in Madison, a decent deli is something I've missed for a long time.  I've tried every suggestion for 'a great reuben' and have been disappointed every time.  

That being said, I wasn't super impressed with Stalzys' reuben - not nearly enough meat.  What I would suggest is ordering the 'bread meat bread' sandwich.  The bread meat bread is the only sandwich* I've had here (or anywhere in Madison) that has enough meat that I would consider it a deli sandwich.

Not a good deli by serious deli standards, but definitely decent.  Hands down the best I've had in Madison.  

*burgers excluded"}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches. I think the Reuben's & Rachel's are the way to go. Friday fish fry is also good. Today I had a breakfast brisket egg sandwich. To be honest it was much too salty...... and I love salt. Needed a sweet component, like a jam or sweet-pickle to bring it down a notch. Borscht soup was great."}
{"text":"I like this place. I had a really great bowl of Borscht here. I also think the sandwiches I tried we quite good. The turkey ruben and a special turkey salad sandwich were great. There are a few rough edges but I don't think the prices are out of line for well crafted deli fare."}
{"text":"Best Reuben I've ever had. Very friendly staff, and beautiful dining room. The hot dog is quite good, and the breakfast stuff is off the hook. It is expensive, but the quality is there. They also have Hamm's on tap!"}
{"text":"Good:  My sandwich was super tasty...Grilled Cheese with ham MOUNDED ON.  The bread was expertly toasted.  Tomato tasted like a tomato.

Bad:  $9 average for a SANDWICH??!!??  Some were $12!  This isn't NYC!
I would've loved to try something else other than a GC, but I have a mortgage to pay.

Summary:  I was soooooo looking forward to this addition to my neighborhood, but probably will never go back.  Bummer.  This place looks like it belongs on Monroe Street, not Atwood Ave.  

It's just too bad they didn't skimp on the build-out, reclaim some old diner bar and stools, and pass the savings onto the customer.  

I'm still giving 3 stars because the food was good, the service was fine, and maybe this is your kind of thing.  For me, the next time I want an awesome Grilled Sandwich I'm going downtown to the Old Fashioned and I'm getting fries with it for the same price."}
{"text":"I gave this 2 stars. If I go back and breakfast is killer I *might* bump to a 3. 

And that's because of the service.

We've been in here about 3 times since it opened, most recently tonight, and the staff is just snarky and rude. You get the sense that they think patrons should be just lucky to eat there. Kinda ruins the whole experience.

First, snark. Then after the rudeness you get to choose - at a walk-up service counter - whether you want to tip? Um, no. I have to admit it takes some skills to be rude in 3-4 different ways in a 2-minute transaction. 

Another poor guy came in after us at 7:50 and the staff person said first thing to him, \"We close in 10 minutes.\" Proud of the guy for saying something like \"Can't you pound out a sandwich in 10 minutes?\" I mean, really.

We had the turkey pastrami (pretty good) and a tuna melt that was a one-slice, open-faced melt. It was just ho-hum. The potato salad side was good. I wish the menu would have said they had German potato salad, too, because another staff person came up to us with it in hand to asked if we ordered it. (We hadn't, would have if it were on the menu.)

So the food's decent, they've got a lot of beer, but there's a 2.7% debit card charge. And like most of the other reviewers have said it's expensive, too.  

But just remember, the rudeness is for free!"}
{"text":"Really excited about the idea, but the prices are definitely inflated, as almost everyone has mentioned."}
{"text":"Really disappointing, sorry to say. Some kind of weird latke wannabe that was mushy raw on he inside & burnt black on the outside. Reuben sandwich that was too salty to finish. And it wasn't that big to begin with. It looks really nice, I will say that."}
{"text":"We ordered two, simple sandwiches, and it took 30 minutes to get them. When we asked about it, the staff was rude and dismissive. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Stalzy's sandwiches are transcendent. They make their own bread and smoke their own meats. Some favorites include the BLT, Judy Judy Judy, Friday fish fry, and the breakfast sandwich. Be sure to check the specials board, they have a schnitzel sandwich from time to time that's not to be passed up. It's easily my favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

We were vendors at Stalzy's fall flea market.  This was the first time I ever heard of the place.  They pride themselves on being a model of a New York style deli.  I've never been to New York, but I'll say, save the airfare and eat here.

You'll be amazed how clean the place is.  Also the staff is more friendly than a bunch of glazed eye Christians at a Billy Graham revival.  They really made you fee welcome.

The menu choices are vast.  Burgers, sandwiches, beer... Stalzy has what you'd expect in a higher end deli.  No other place in Madison has such good sandwich choices.

Being a deli, I ordered a  Pastrami Ruben.  Simply the best I've ever had.  Great quality meats, bread and toppings.  They make there own pastrami.  Pure bliss.

The only downfall to some might be the prices, but when you figure the sandwich was large and in charge, and busting with quality, 9 dollars isn't that unreasonable.

I'll definitely come back again.  I think the only way a trip to Stalzy's could be more like a trip to New York is to arrive in a yellow taxi reeking with curry.

A++ Stalzy's!"}
{"text":"I love the regular menu items, but the specials are usually knockouts too. Some of the flavored remind me of my times spent in Europe."}
{"text":"Being someone with a lot of experience eating at Jewish delis, I'm having trouble both with finding Stalzy's sandwiches \"huge\" or with raving about the food. Stalzy's is super-cute and I enjoyed the decor, products (old-timey gums and sodas and such), and food well-enough, but it was hard not to be disappointed after all my friends' ravings.

I got a salami sandwich (not on the menu), and the bread was good. The sandwich was small, though, by deli standards. A person with a bigger appetite would have been sad. I ordered a horseradish mayo that didn't have much flavor, and the onion slices that came with the sandwich were threadbare. 

So, jury's out, as the fervor with which respected friends talk about this place make me want to try it again. The Reuben, I have to admit, looked better than my sandwich."}
{"text":"Jeez Louise, Madison, keep your pants on. Nine bucks for a good reuben is reasonable. And a good reuben is exactly what I had at Stalzys. 

The corned beef was a great victory of flavor and texture. The rye was lightly grilled, possibly in real butter, providing a little crunchy richness.

I got a small container of potato salad to go, and it rivaled what I used to buy from the family-owned Polish deli in my hometown. 

Bring cash money."}
{"text":"Been to Stalzy's 2x. One carry out cold sandwich. It was average and took nearly 25 minutes on a slow day. Ate in had a great 4 Star corn beef sandwich but the deli was dead and it still took almost a half an hour. Stalzy was there but he and the rest of the staff either didn't notice or didn't care. Slow service when you are busy is ok slow service when you are slow is disappointing. But not caring or not noticing is the hardest for me to deal with."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood café.  We've eaten here many times before but my first time giving them a review.  So after repeat visits i can say they are consistent on excellent service, food is always good and fresh.  Clean, clean, clean!  Love that they try to source local for their FRESH ingredients.  I would highly recommend.  Have had their fish fry.  It's a must."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night. Amazing!!!  I'm not super adventurous so I took the safe route and had the burger. The burger itself was awesome, but they top it off with homemade bun (icing on the cake!). My husband had the Rachel. Pastrami and coleslaw sandwich. I don't like cole slaw but tasted it anyway; it blew me away, and then I ate more. 
I think it's great food at a great value and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"After scouring downtown Madison after work on Friday for a place still serving sandwiches (why is this such a mission?), Stalzy's pulled through for us. When we walked in and looked up at the menu, we knew it was meant to be because I was with my best friend Rachel, and that's one of their best selling sandwiches. 

If I were to turn her into a sandwich, I'm not sure that I would include pastrami, slaw, Russian dressing, and rye...but it was pretty flipping amazing. I'm not even a big slaw fan, but it really hit the spot on this sandwich. I'm salivating writing this review right now, wow, I loved this sandwich so much. I'm really happy they had the turkey pastrami as a choice, for the non-pork eaters like me. 

Big portions, reasonable prices, good location, can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I will be back!

I've had this place bookmarked for a while now. Came in on Sunday for a late lunch... We got such an entrance by a man behind the counter that was so excited to show us the menu. I asked for a suggestion from the man, and i order The Rachel (Turkey with slaw). It was super!! My boyfriend enjoyed his bloody and Tough Guy sandwich. 

They also have their own parking lot (major +++ in that neighborhood)."}
{"text":"Just had what have been the best Reuben of my life but I did just have the most expensive one. $9 for a small sandwich with no sides just seem a bit much."}
{"text":"Went here for Oktoberfest fest on a windy cold 43 degree day. The weather looks liked it kept people away. Went here for beer and the live band. Karben4 brewery supplied the beer. The fest food looked good but we already ate. For Oktoberfest I thought a Latin American jazz band was strange. The weather and the out of place band led us on our way."}
{"text":"While in Madison I wanted to find an authentic Jewish Deli.  I searched yelp for the \"Jewish Deli\" and found this place.  The name sure sounded to me like the proprietor was going for Jewish, so...Stalzy's it was.  

     The layout of the place was really cool.  It had a few booths and a little lunch counter.  It could only go down from here in my book, and it did. 

     If Yelp allowed reviewers to title their reviews, I would title this one, \"What the Fu£k is a Bialy?\"

     Seriously, what's a Bialy? 

     I'm sitting in the booth across from my buddy and he asks me what I'm going to have.  I tell him, without even picking up a menu that I have my heart set on lox and bagels.  Then he says something so despicable I can hardly being myself to repeat it.  I mean I'm going to repeat it for you guys but I just want you to know how annoying it is for me to do.  He says, is a \"Bialy\" the same thing as a bagel?  I told him it was probably some hipster way of saying bagel.  I had already made up in my mind that I wasn't going to play this game.  I've lived this long without saying venti or grande, I wasn't calling a bagel a Bialy.  

      I told the cashier I wanted a bagel and lox.  He said, \"You mean a Bialy.\" I said, \"you don't have bagels?!?\"  He said, \"Nope, only bialies.\"  Then he pointed his stubby little sandwich maker to this dusty bread abortion.  A bialy was a half bagel/half English muffin.  This was no Jewish Deli.  

     I opted for eggs, sausage and bacon with a side of latkes.  The thought the food was great but It could have been attributed to the fact that it took the cook just under and hour to prepare my very basic order.  

    I would have liked to have tried some of their other dishes but I didn't get a chance.  This deli is less Jewish than Einstein's Bagels but it's worth trying."}
{"text":"More people should be flocking to this place. This is some of the best lunch and dinner food I have ever eaten and will always come back. Their deserts are delicious, as well. I come here for take-out often, and am so in love with the entire menu. The location is fabulous and the staff is ALWAYS friendly. This is a perfect place for a family to gather for lunch or even a quick meal. Friendly/delicious/pefect"}
{"text":"This place is a major rip-off. My corned beef reuben was skimpy with very little flavor. It was so bland (even with sauerkraut--I know, I thought it would be impossible to be bland) that I had to resort to dipping it in catsup just to finish it. This Reuben was so thin, it was an embarrassment. Culvers seriously has a better Reuben, with sides, that would cost considerably less than the $9 I forked out for one measly sandwich at Stalzy's. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sooo, Stalzey's Deli...
We've heard so much about it and wanted to try a great Reuben on a cold April day we gave it a shot. 
Overshot as it turns out. 
While the onion soup was tasty- not exactly french onion soup ala the old Ovens of Brittany- it was admirable, tasty, and worth $3.50 for a cup. Could have been hotter though....and would have totally rocked a 5 star. 
My partner ordered the Brooklyn and I ordered the traditional Reuben. 
The Brooklyn had burnt and oil/butter soaked bread and dehydrated and salty (and I like salt- but this was crazy salty) pastrami. We traded half sandwiches halfway through lunch. 
The traditional was okay but we were looking for THE BEST Reuben in Madison. We didn't find it at Stalzey's Deli. 
We found an overpriced sandwich that any PDQ could offer. Lunch for two, with a cup of soup and water, rang up at $32 bills. 
Overpriced for a Madison lunch claiming such platitudes toward their customers' (and their own) dedication to food service and sourcing. 
Would I go again? No. As I've said before, too many other options in Madison. 
Service? Excellent. 
What I thought about during lunch? Why isn't it warmer in here. There baking bread and cooking. It should be at least 60. 
Food? Meh. 
Better option: The Harmony Bar. A block or two away."}
{"text":"Living only blocks down the road and a huge fan of a corned beef reuben, I was ecstatic to see darkened windows of the closed Africana lit back up with a wonderful deli. Stalzy's couldn't have picked a better spot, nestled between Bunky's Cafe and Daisy Cafe and Cupcakery, just steps off the bike trail. The ambiance inside is perfect; they did a great job of overhauling the former Africana.

I've eaten there several times with a few different friends and everyone's opinion of the food they've ordered has been great. My top three are the corned beef, turkey pastrami and regular pastrami. They also have great bialys and other breads, and the sides are awesome.

I personally didn't have a problem with the size of the sandwich I received as some people have mentioned. However, I will agree that for $9, I was kinda expecting to get a side or two included with my sandwich. That would be my only real criticism at this point. I have noticed; however, that when they've posted the daily special on Facebook (yeah, go be a fan!), they've included a side. So, I am hoping this is something they're sorting out as we speak.

I am looking forward to picking up some sides and hot dogs for grilling out this spring/summer.

If you haven't given Stalzy's a chance yet, head up there right away. And a little helpful note, they're cash-only like a lot of other Atwood/Willy St. businesses."}
{"text":"My first time at Stalzy's was one of best burgers and fries in the Atwood neighborhood, and the price literally cannot be beat! I didn't understand the \"seat yourself and come find us when you are read to order\" atmosphere at first, but the more you go, the more you get used to it! Go here, try their burger and fries - you will not be let down! :-)"}
{"text":"Lets start with the positive I loved the Orange Ruglah.

I had a pastrami sandwich and I LOVE good pastrami.  If you like overly salty oversmoked meats this might be a place you'll love.  I love to smoke things.  I have two smokers in my backyard and even from time to time make my own Pastrami.  

I have been to Katz's deli in New York and seek out good authentic Pastrami.  Stalzy's is unique they heavily smoke their own meats and I think they are a bit over the top on their Pastrami.  

Now I live smoked food but it has to compliment the food not be tie end all be all quality that comes out (other than salt in this case)

That said there is enough praise for this place here to make me want to try some of the other neat things looking on their menu so i may revisit my rating at a later date and will stop again"}
{"text":"Ridiculous.   You pay Manhattan Jewish deli prices for about one third of the (sandwich) portions.  And the place isn't even near downtown and paying the higher rents of State St or Capitol Square.   The service is pretty slow for deli as well.  I am struggling to think of a bigger rip off in Madison."}
{"text":"We tried Stalzy's again last night, for its Friday fish fry and again the only thing that had the \"wow\" factor was the price. Since we live in the neighborhood, we decided to do take out. 

It was $20 for two pieces of walleye. The fish was nice size, unfortunately we could not eat it. It was way too salty. After a few bites, it made us sick. It is unfortunate because the pan-fried breading seemed like it would have been quite good otherwise. But at last, the only flavor was table salt. 

The fish comes with two \"potato pancakes\". Only these were not like any potato pancake I have ever had. Let me just add a disclaimer here, I grew up eating homemade potato pancakes. So the \"pancake\" was more like a mushy crepe, burnt black on both sides. Amazingly even with the char, it was still mushy. I would compare most closely to the sponge bread served in Ethiopian restaurants, only not as good. Like the fish, it was uneatable. 

So we are left with the coleslaw and rye bread (not toasted). Also included, was what I can only think was an attempt at condiments. One pre-squeezed, very thin lemon that was less a wedge and more like a sliver was included in our styrofoam to-go box. Along with what I think was once tarter sauce, only it was hard to tell because again it looked as though someone had already had used most of it. Although, there was some extra drizzled and dried down the side of the cup. 

So for all of this, we dealt with the ATM fee, a very pretentious counter girl who gave us attitude about taking our food to go, and tried to overcharge us. Again, Stalzy's missed the mark, and has one less neighborhood customer. So disappointing, I so want to love this place. If you are in the neighborhood, try The Victory across the street, or Daisy's Cafe a block away. Save your money and skip Stalzy's."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious deli fare. We enjoyed the triple and the borscht. The borscht was filling and had a kick to it. The triple is a behemoth, multi-tiered sandwich with coleslaw. I definitely recommend sharing the triple with a friend. They only take cash and check but they have an ATM inside and will discount the ATM service fee for you."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Finally got a chance to try it with my 4 year old. They have a kids menu, but she ordered the grilled cheese off the regular menu and loved it. I got the turkey sandwich and we also got an order of potato pancakes. They were delicious!! I can't wait to go back. Prices were moderate and well worth it!! The service at the counter was excellent too!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Stalzy's for the first time last week.  My pastrami on rye was very good.  The regular pastrami (one can also order lean for $2 more) was tasty and thinly sliced, with a reasonable amount of fat.  The light rye was decent though nothing special.  My husband had turkey and cheddar on white with lettuce and sliced tomato.  Pickle slices were also good.  There were free refills on the house-made iced tea.  The amount of meat on the sandwiches was reasonable rather than piled high as is the case with most NYC Jewish delis.  I like it this way because a high pile of meat causes meat overload!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the opportunity to try Stalzy's.  A local review praised the quality and quantity of the food.  The best part of the corned beef sandwich was the bread.  At $9 for a Rueben, it should be worth $9.  When you take a bite of your sandwich, you shouldn't pull out the entire contents.  Large amounts of fat were included, at no charge.  Things they could do to improve ... Thinner slices and better trimmed meat and include a side for $9!"}
{"text":"My first time here, a huge deli fan, and it was pretty damn good.  It's not NYC, no smoked sturgeon or anything like that, but the house brined and smoked/roasted meats and the homemade bread are out of the world good.  Best smoked turkey I've ever had.  Solid menu, great staff, owner is super cool.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star place in my book.

I like the atmosphere in this nice corner spot in the Atwood area. There's some great artwork and some awesome bathroom decor as well. The bread is excellent. Ideal for a sandwich really with just the right crisp and sourness to it. I had a really yummy biali here as well. On top of that they serve Just coffee, a really solid Madison local. 

Where things kind of fall apart for me a bit is the pastrami itself. It was pretty salty for my taste. It was noticeable enough to make what should have been an awesome sandwich a little subpar. Would definitely come back to give it another shot but the salty pastrami was enough for me to round down to 3 stars."}
{"text":"It took us many years before we encountered this little gem in Atwood neighborhood. I have little knowledge about Jewish deli so it took us a while to figure what to order. I really appreciate that the staff explained the menu to us with great patience. They make bread, corned beef, pastrami and sausages themselves and provide the meat to other restaurant in town. You can also purchase bread or meat to go. 

We had \"Brooklyn Breakfast\" (beef pastrami sandwich) and a Challah French Toast. Very delicious. Quite a refreshing taste from other more regular brunch places. The portion is a bit small, though. 

People in our group had Stalzy's bloody Mary. Pretty fancy. Apparently they are quite good that a friend of us ordered a second one. 

I hope to return sometime in the future to try out Saltzy's non-brunch food. 

Note: Cash only. Seat yourself before your order."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, as I love supporting local businesses, but my first experience here was disappointing.  I ordered a half pastrami and half corned beef sandwich. No condiments, no toppings, just meat and bread.  I also tried the potato salad and beet salad.  The shop has a nice atmosphere and appears to stock decent quality products.  After that, things went downhill.  After ordering, I waited a full 30 minutes for my food.  I paid about $18 for the food (I was eating alone) and it took 30 minutes to scoop some pre-made salads into bowls and to put meat on bread....   my guess is that they are understaffed, as it seems like others have had long wait times too.  I literally watched as other people approached the counter and asked staff if their orders had been forgotten about (so it wasn't just me being a whiner).  The staff on site were working hard, but the wait time was unacceptable.   I was also not particularly excited by the food once it arrived.  The salads were good, but the meat was very salty and the smoked/saltiness overpowered the flavor of the meat.  To be honest, I couldn't even tell the difference between the pastrami and corned beef.... and I should have been able to.  They even looked the same (very thin slices).  I had high hopes, but won't be returning to this deli any time soon.  Sorry, Stalzys."}
{"text":"Great place for a truly classic deli sandwich. My partner turned me into this place for one of the best places for a Rueben- and he is right! Plenty of house-cured corned beef and just the right amount of fat(yes, good deli meat like this comes with some, and they don't go overboard like other places) to chew on.

Don't forget to take home some bialy!"}
{"text":"Huge portion of meat on their sandwiches- usually.  I say that because there have been a couple of times someone was in the kitchen cheaping-out my sandwich by giving much smaller portions.  Not cheap, but half a sandwich fills me and the other is for later.  Love their meats!"}
{"text":"Brooklyn Reuben was excellent. The images on the website make the sandwiches appear larger than the actual portion, my only complaint. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good, but the price isn't the easiest on the pocket."}
{"text":"Living in Chicago most of my life, I know Deli's!   Food was great and loved the big kosher dill (one my fav's and so reminds of Chicago where you wouldn't get a Deli sandwich anywhere without one!).   I like the old fashioned bar thing and ample parking.  Nice to have somewhere to go for good old fashioned deli food.  Service wasn't that great  though- could have used more help, place was crowded and waitress had some attitude going on.  Excellent cole slaw and good prices."}
{"text":"I love me a big juicy pastrami sandwich on rye. Been meaning to get to Stalzy's for some time to get one which many seem to believe is the best pastrami sandwich in town. My two prior lunch attempts where foiled by a big crowd and a cash only policy, respectively.  This time, I planned ahead and went to miss the lunch rush and with cash in my pocket (actually with my wife who had cash in her purse).  

Straying a little from my purpose, I ordered the \"Brooklyn breakfast\" which is pastrami and an egg with cheese between two slices of grilled rye bread.   A side of potato salad was mandatory.  My wife had a corned beef reuben with a side of pickled beets.  

There was a clear star in this meal - - the pastrami. It was awesome. Served warm with just the right amount of fat and seasoning.  (Apparently, you don't get all the pastrami you can eat if you work there. I know. I asked our server).  Five stars for the pastrami and I would give it more if I could. 

The supporting cast was pretty good too. The space is clean, casual and the service is very good.  It appears that they really care about the quality of their food.  The potato salad was good and had a tangy flavor which was a little unusual for me but was a nice change.  My wife loved her pickled beets.  Everything was fresh and neatly plated.  

Portion sizes were fair for the prices. The prices are on the high side which I can understand given the quality of the meats and what I'm sure is the significant amount of time needed to prepare them. It seemed that most of the sandwiches are between $6-12; sides, $2 each. Sandwiches are served a la carte with a pickle spear. 

For our two sandwiches, sides, and a cup of coffee with tip, lunch came out to a little over $30.  In retrospect, seems a little high as I did leave a little hungry. But the pastrami. Oh, the pastrami... 

All told, four stars. Five would be deserving if it were a little less expensive or there was a lot more pastrami."}
{"text":"Had a corned beef sandwich and coffee.  The corned beef was good.  They need to add a value proposition or wow factor, then this will be a great place.  My suggestion would be to charge a couple dollars more for the sandwich and throw in the sides.  $2.50 ea for a side of potato salad or coleslaw, yeeks.  Thats $5 for typical sides with a corned beef sandwich thats already $9.00, Mound the corned beef, give a bit of value.  When you are eating there I do not like the idea of paying when you order.  I also thought it was a bit insulting to be asked for a dollar for a refill of my coffee.  This could be a great place with a few little \"value\" improvements.  Service and value need work."}
{"text":"I went to Stalzy's for lunch today hoping for some quality sandwiches. It started off well, though they only had two beers on tap, they had a good selection of bottled beer. My sister an I each selected a beer and sat down to wait...and wait...and wait. Come on guys, this is a sandwich, not the Mona Lisa. Forty minutes passed and by that time, my sister and I would have thought just about anything was delicious - but it wasn't. Eventually the food came, a thin sandwich with one pickle spear (less garnish than a bloody mary would get). \"Do you smell bacon?\" I asked. My sister agreed that she did in fact smell bacon. We each took our first bite. Corned beef should not taste like bad bacon! The meat was over-salted in the extreme and somehow dry, stringy, and burnt while still being half chunks of fat. In a single bite, you could experience charcoal, jerky, and all the super-concentrated flavors of the great salt lake. The sauerkraut had little flavor and made the bread (which tasted of nothing) soggy. I took a second bite and decided that I couldn't eat any more. Grossed out and Hangry, we headed for the nearest McDonalds. I'm rather horrified to admit that the McDonalds' food was better. At least the beer at Stalzy's was good, but not even the beer could rid us of the unpleasant salty aftertaste or make us want to ever return."}
{"text":"Food

Just say no. I ordered the grilled cheese with turkey. It was so salty that it was barely edible. The sandwich was pretty small for $5.50, I was hoping that the sandwich would be somewhat filling. I did not make it a platter meal because the side options were terrible. Four out of seven are mayonnaise based salads. The other three are pickled or vinegar. Sauerkraut is prevalent throughout the menu. I understand every establishment has to have a style or niche but there was nothing that appealed to me.


Service

The service was pretty slow. They do not take names or numbers for the orders. So every time something comes up in the window they stop at every table and ask who it belongs to. It is pretty annoying when you are six orders back from the front of the line.

I have no intention of heading back."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a day trip to Madison. After being told it would be ready in 10 minutes, we waited 40 minutes...with a toddler in the car. With the good reviews I surprised to find blamd sandwiches on cheap white bread. To top it off, they shorted us half our order! Waste of time and money. Won't be back here and will spread the word to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Stalzy's has been a super addition to willy street and Madison overall. We needed a place that serves solid corned beef.

Their pastrami is really nice - a bit heavier coriander flavor (less pepper) than normal. The rachel sandwich is a can't miss here. Their brunch is the best kept secret in Madison. I'm not going to give it away, but make it a point to go."}
{"text":"Shameful. This place will not be open 6 months. Ridiculous prices (cash only so they can get an ATM fee out of you), small portions, rude staff.

Their ATM was broken which necessitated a 3 block drive to get cash and come back. Who doesn't take cards nowadays? 

We paid 30 dollars for 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks and a bag of chips. Yeah, you read that right.

The pastrami is beyond fatty and served on some completely average bread which was garnished with a long black hair. The burger was tough, overcooked but still managed to be small and greasy.

Long story short avoid this place at all costs. Hipster faux deli."}
{"text":"We came for lunch but couldn't resist the all-day breakfast options. Sharing the salmon bialy and confit hash, both were outstanding, sizeable, and not at all options I had expected walking in. It was quite busy and a bit slow, but overall worth it and a decent value."}
{"text":"Just had the fried walleye. I wasn't expecting a deli to rocket to my fish fry short list, but here we are. The fish had an excellent breading, good flavor and firm texture. Additionally, it comes with a good potato selection (i have a weakness for pancakes, and these, by default, come with both sour cream AND applesauce), and a generous bread and garnish plate with a spectacular cole slaw.

I highly recommend the friday night fish fry for anyone craving such fare."}
{"text":"I live really close to here, so I've tried really hard to like Stalzy's. I've given it 5-6 tries. Every time, I'm super disappointed. The sandwiches are mediocre at best. The sides are mediocre at best. Everyone that works there moves like they're under water. I have literally been the only person in there and had it take them 25 minutes to make me a sandwich to go. I would understand if it were busy, but that is ridiculous. I miss living in a city with real delis, and hopefully Madison will do better soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Stalzy's several times and I think this has become a very good sandwich shop. Their Ruebens are most certainly the best in town. Great kraut, great Russian dressing, great bread, good cheese, nicely greasy, and good meat, all homemade.  9/10.

Their homemade pastrami has become a little leaner and less salty but actually increased in flavor. Portions are less than big-city sandwiches, unfortunately for similar prices, but the quality here is excellent and execution has grown consistent. 

I can't speak for fish fries or some of the other items but I do think this place is absolutely worth a visit for a top-shelf deli sandwich or a rueben. 

Because they make so many of the items from scratch I'd even give Stalzy's a vote for 'destination dining' in Madison. Service is a little blasé but I guess I would be too without tips. The space is nice and casual."}
{"text":"If you are in the market for a good sandwich, this place is for you! With all day breakfast and an array of handcrafted sandwiches, there's something for everyone. The tough guy was the juiciest roast beef sandwich I've ever had and the potato salad was the perfect side. Definitely will be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  Breakfast - Corned beef hash is the best I have ever had, fantastic.  The coffee is very good too, which is important to me when it comes to brekkie.  The place has a great atmosphere, very clean and we are always treated well by the staff.

Double smoked beef brisket is excellent, again some of the best I have ever had.

All said, I love this place.  Prices are a bit steep, but everything so far has been done right and I hope this place is around for a long time"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim as I pass by this local business daily. The exterior is neat and the interior is neater!! Loved the decor, openness and large windows! I ordered the beer battered Perch with German potato salad, a cup of soup and a craft beer. The Perch had a great, light batter!! I loved it! It was the perfect compliment to this fish, not too heavy/not too light/not greasy! Four good sized pieces came with the order. The tartar sauce seemed to be a homemade variety with a pickle flavoring...nice difference to the \"standard\" sauce! The soup I chose was a vegetable lentil and was heavy on ingredients, thick sauce and was superb! It seemed homemade! The German potato salad came FRIED! WOW!! This was a new thing to me! I was told by the owner it's fried in a iron skillet, but they would \"gladly change it out if I didn't like it\"! THAT was cool! BUT! I thought it was a tastey change and \"licked the platter clean!\" Stalzy's has a pretty nice selection of bottled craft  beers and I chose a fabulous winter ale, Jubelale by Deschutes. This dinner was a delight and I will absolutely come back to try a Reuben!! The only reason for the 4-stars is the $16 cost of the fish fry. It seemed a bit steep for a deli, but the service is outstanding and the menu has a nice selection! I arrived early (Friday, 4:40PM), was one of four in the place and my meal arrived in under 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Stalzy's have mastered the art of meat on crispy bread. The tough guy roast beef sandwich (Roast beef, havarti, red onion & horseradish mayo on white) stands out as one of the best things I've had out to eat. Other highlights of the menu include the sausage platter, the roast beast, the warm german potatoe salad, and the Fried Walleye sandwich (special). Their Friday Walleye fish fry is also really hard to beat! All this with mix and match six packs, loaves of baked-in-house bread, and Haribo gummies at the checkout, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"We get takeout from Stalzys a few times a month. My boyfriend loves their sandwiches, and we both enjoy the breakfast sandwich when hungover (and the potato pancakes!). They also have a decent beer selection (mix and match 6 packs), and good breads. 

They have a few vegetarian sandwich options but I wish they'd bring back the Glaza or another cold vegetarian sandwich that isn't mainly cheese. The veggie Reuben is good, especially if you add beets to it."}
{"text":"I love corned beef...and salami...and pastrami...and most cured meats for that matter (like bacon...mmm...bacon!).  I'm partial to Manny's in Chicago even after journeys to the supposed best delis in the world in New York City.  So, I wanted to love Stalzy's, I really did.  It's a classic deli!  Right in my neighborhood!  The design and decor from the logo is very well done.  The staff was friendly, and nice when I dined.  The menu was limited and focused on breakfast all day and classic deli fare.  It really had all the ingredients going for a great restaurant... until the food came.

A very small for $9 sandwich promptly arrived.  Thin, unsubstantial, and flavorless rye bread was dominated and soaked through with grease by massively oversalted corned beef and pastrami.  Supposedly lean cuts of each were heavily striated with lots of fat, which was made worse by my inability to get ultra thin sliced meat because they preslice it.  Chewing through these thick fatty layers just made me feel gross.  

To top it all off, they didn't have any plain yellow mustard.  They only had the \"deli\" kind with horseradish that I hate.

Overpriced bad food with small servings in a lovely setting near my house served with a smile.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It may have taken us a long while to truly discover Stalzy's (you know, like actually parking the car, going inside and eating their food). However, in the last 3 months, we've more than made up for lost time. My husband and I went there for dinner one night and then came back for breakfast the next morning. I'm not even kidding! The service was lovely. One of the owners was at the counter on our first visit. He was genuine, friendly, helpful and clearly passionate & proud of what they've created.

Then just a month or so later, we came back for dinner (and an unplanned loaf of challah to go). I want to be sure to note, you will not have a cheap dinner here. You can expect to pay around $40-ish for 2 people for dinner (with sides, beverages and desserts, if that's how you roll). But you can also expect to have beautiful, quality, local and made from scratch food so no worries.

Okay, now for some much delayed, juicy details.... On our first ever dinner visit, I ordered the evening special: the Brisket Reuben (DUDE! Stupid good, yo!) with macaroni salad (so-so, no my fav) and their beet dill salad (amazing, tender, balanced - I order it every time I'm there). My husband got the burger with kettle chips and he was a happy, happy boy. The burger was done perfectly, the bun was divine - a \"culinarily\" good time was had by all.
The next morning we showed up for breakfast. The service wasn't as amazing as the night before, but the food did not disappoint. The challah French toast was comforting, buttery, not at all soggy and very delicious. I also got an egg and a side of bacon to ensure I started my day with a punch of protein. Their house-cured bacon was incredible. Order it - early and often - it's the real deal. When my husband asked how it was, all I could muster was a quiet \"Oh my god, shut up...\". Translation: SO GOOD!!!

And finally, on our most recent visit, my husband had the burger (again) because he loves it. He actually verbalized that it's one of the best burgers in the city. I will be having it next time. I ordered the Classic Club at the recommendation of a friend with the beet dill salad (still my fav side) and the potato salad (really good - I would order it again). It was a great club! The bread, as always, was ridiculously wonderful and once again, the sandwich was totally balanced in flavor and texture.

So there it is. I'm definitely a fan (hook, line and sinker) and I look forward to many more deli sandwich adventures with our new friends at Stalzy's. Maybe 2016 will be the year of the deli sandwich.........who knows. Either way, onward and eat more beet dill salad!!!"}
{"text":"I like their roast beef sandwiches. Zippy sauces and clean tables. Service was ok - your order at the counter and they bring it to you. Not much interaction. Very good variety of drinks (yes! Sprechers Cream Ale).

12/2015: Food is still really good...unfortunately - the staff always seem confused about the menu and act as though this was their fourth choice of places they wanted to work..."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed Stalzys in the past?  I don't get here as much as I should but everytime I come, I leave a huge fan.  They have the best corned beef and pastrami in the city hands down.  I don't recall where they get their rye bread but the combination of salty cured beef and the rye (with the help of some brown mustard) is a lunch made in heaven.  Order at the counter and grab a seat.  At times, the wait can be longer than it should for the food to arrive but by the end of the meal, any misdeeds have been long forgotten and I leave a satisfied and full customer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were seeking the best reuben in Madison. Article after article suggested coming here. So we ordered to go and hoped we wouldn't be let down.

Funnily enough I'd noticed this place a few times while driving down Atwood. I thought Stalzy's looked really nice and was exactly the kind of place my boyfriend and I would love. I'm glad I got to stop by.

We asked the nice female on the phone what she suggested. She told us that there were two types of reubens, the corned beef reuben, and the pastrami reuben. So we got both along with the German potato salad, macaroni salad, and the borscht.

Unfortunately when I was splitting up the reuben halves I accidentally forgot which was which. Both my boyfriend and I are pretty sure we preferred, what we thought was, the corned beef reubun. I'm not sure if it's the best reuben I've ever had, but it was certainly phenomenal. I will definitely be coming back here in the future when I have a reuben craving.

The macaroni salad wasn't exactly to my liking, but it wasn't bad. My boyfriend absolutely loved it though. I ended up taking the German potato salad. German potato salad meaning it's served hot and with bacon. It tasted just like what my grandmother used to make for breakfast when I was a kid. It was amazing and I can't wait to get more later.

As for the borscht, I'm so upset. I was ecstatic when I saw a restaurant in Madison serving it. I was pumped the whole way there. Imagining a delicious bowl of bright red soup filled with plump beets and a dollop of sour cream. I was even more ecstatic when I heard it came with a German dinner bun. Much to my disappointment, I came home with a brown, unappetizing, bowl of mushy dirt tasting paste. The bun was good and they did include the dollop of sour cream, but the borscht was just so bad I barely touched it.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Just don't get the borscht."}
{"text":"Hi, All
I've been looking forward to trying a Madison-centric Pastrami for quite a while! When I got home with my mountain o meat, I must say I was disappointed. Waay too salty! Now, before you get out your jump to conclusions mat, I must inform you that I have made corned beef from scratch at home on multiple occasions, and I've had Katz's flown in. Neither were this briny. Katz's, quite frankly I found too mild for my taste. The only thing I can think of is that Stalzy's either makes too strong a brine vs. seasoning, or they let it steep too long. I would love to try them again, but they need to taste their own product against a control in order to correct the situation. Breads and sides were awesome, so no probs there. Bevvy choices are up to par with the menu. Maybe my batch didn't get a proper rinse? Unknown, but I will give them a shot again to see if a pattern is forming out of the mist. They sure beat the crap out of the African joint that preceeded them in this space. If I wanted goat chunks in peanut butter, I bet that this white boy from Wisconsin coulda done that!"}
{"text":"So delish and wonderful. My husband and I both had reubens, like angel kisses from wonderful meat sandwiches."}
{"text":"The Rueben and the Rachel are phenominal; best I've ever had! The rye bread on both sanwhiches was crisp and the sauce was even better. Not to mention the atmosphere was very cool and welcoming. If your in the area and want some bomb sandwiches, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:30am for breakfast and the place was empty. The staff was extremely friendly, though, and gave us good recommendations. I ordered the daily breakfast special: eggs, bacon, potato pancakes, and applesauce. Everything was delicious and for a total of $12 with a soda, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"man... i was so excited when stalzy's opened. but what can I say that hasn't already been said? the decor is really nicely done and the food is decent, but it's SO overpriced... yet another example of this town being too big for its britches (news flash: Madison is NOT a metropolitan area, so charging $12 for a sandwich sans side is really not ok). the club was good and the bacon they used was top notch, but come on, guys. I think it's safe to say that everyone in the neighborhood is happy you're here and would like to see you last, but you might want to rethink your portions and pricing."}
{"text":"Nope. Uh-uh. Not gonna happen.

I've been here once. I got a pastrami and swiss with mustard on rye, my standard order for a Jewish deli. A Jewish deli sandwich is supposed to be enormous, overflowing with meat. This was not. It was about half the thickness that I would expect. The real problem was the pastrami. It was so salty that it wasn't edible-- not bordering on inedible, not just a touch too salty, but completely inedible. 

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love Stalzy's sandwiches and am basically addicted to their chocolate/butterscotch bars, so I had been eager to try their Friday fish fry and it did not disappoint!  You get a choice of walleye or beer battered perch (they used Hamm's when we were there, not sure if they switch it up) and a choice of potato pancakes or German potato salad.  I went with the walleye, my husband the perch and both were perfectly cooked and battered.  The batter on the perch was particularly excellent - I swear you could taste the beer.  The potato pancakes were a nice change of pace instead of the usual fish fry potato options, but they are definitely filling!  They also bring out a relish tray with assorted breads prior to the entrees.  I thought the $16 price was very reasonable.  

The service, as usual, was awesome and I love the comfortable space of this deli."}
{"text":"While in the neighborhood, I thought to get a reuben sandwich to go.  I should have consulted my earlier review, because this place still adheres to the stubborn belief that corned beef can be sliced with the grain, salted to within an inch of the Dead Sea's salinity, and systematically drained of moisture to the consistency of jerky.  All of these issues are inherently resolvable, but apparently, the owners' collective hubris trumps common sense.  Here's a tip, kids-if the corned beef isn't being sliced against the grain on a board (within eyesight of the customers) after taking a nice warm bath until it is steaming and fork tender, your results may vary.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come to Stalzy's for breakfast probably once every two weeks for the past year and a half and I've never found anything to complain about. Everyone who works here is extremely friendly, genuine and welcoming and the house made bread and jam are to die for. My boyfriend and I are big breakfast people and there is not a single breakfast place in Madison that even compares. Highly recommend if you want a laid back environment with high quality local food."}
{"text":"Took maybe twenty minutes half an hour to get food from the time we ordered.  Food was pretty good.  Corned beef was hot and delicious but the bad service takes everything away."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and they have no idea what corned beef is. It's astounding. Taste your food!"}
{"text":"Ignore everything I said in my earlier review and go get breakfast today!
(Seriously!) 
The sandwich joint with Madison's best fish fry also serves incredible breakfast!

And it really doesn't matter what you get... potato pancakes, Challah French toast, corned beef hash... it's all going to be good and it's all served ALL DAY!"}
{"text":"Stalzy's is fantastic - I come here once a week. All of their food is great, but their German potato salad in particular is some of the best that I've ever tasted. On busier days, the food sometimes takes a little longer to come out, but it's more than worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm a Jewish transplant to Madison. I grew up eating in Jewish delis.  So I have pretty high standards when it comes to my corned beef, pastrami, matzo ball soup, pickles and latkes.

I give Stalzy's 3 stars for going to the trouble of making their own corned beef and other meats, and because the only other attempt at a Jewish deli in Madison is Ella's, which is more like a crazy funhouse ice cream parlor that happens to also serve mediocre corned beef sandwiches. 

But I'm sorry, a proper deli corned beef sandwich has a minimum of a 1/2 pound of meat on it.  You want a smaller sandwich?  Get a half sandwich.  Stalzy's sandwiches don't come close to measuring up in this regard, and while they make their meats in house, I just wasn't overly impressed.  

As for y'all Madison folks giving 4-5 stars, hit up Jake's in Milwaukee or Manny's in Chicago, and then come talk to me. Actually the folks who run Stalzy's should check those places out too."}
{"text":"Great sandwich joint. Quality ingredients make for wonderful sandwiches. I would agree that the sandwich size is a little on the smaller side. However, for me it was perfect for lunch. I would also say the price reflects well on the portion size.

ATM located in the restaurant if you get caught without cash. They will refund a dollar if you show them a receipt."}
{"text":"You guys have a serious case of good food bad operation. We love your sandwiches and are constantly trying to eat them, but our problem is that time after time your store is unexpectedly closed during what seem to be normal business hours. \"Normal business hours\" is something we might be able to discuss, but the deeper problem is that your website, your recorded phone message, and even (ironically) this yelp page are all outdated on your hours. Please fix and you will be our favorite spot. If you don't, you are eventually going to lose our business, as well as that of the countless others who probably are saying nothing about this. We're not mad, we're just disappointed."}
{"text":"Well, we have a new favorite deli in Madison! 

I visited Stalzy's today for the first time and it was an excellent find. My wife and I took our two kids and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Not only was the food great, the service was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere highly welcoming. This is a bit of a drive for us but I know we'll be coming back frequently. By the end of the visit I was certainly full, but I still couldn't help looking over the menu again and again thinking about maybe trying just one more thing...

Mushroom barley soup - Wow! What a great way to start a meal. A large steaming bowl arrived at the table looking and smelling delicious. The broth is deeply flavorful with tons of added character from all the ingredients. The carrots add a nice touch of vegetative sweetness but the real stars are the mushrooms and barley. The texture and taste of both mushrooms and barley are superb. There a lusciousness to the mouth feel that would seem more likely from a cream based soup but is hugely welcome nonetheless. The barley retains just a touch of toothsomeness and is not at all mushy. This was a huge hit with everyone! 

Pastrami sandwich - Another stand out hit. We all enjoyed the thinly sliced pastrami and fresh, delicious bread. I asked for extra pickles because they were amazing and a perfect compliment to the sandwich. I also spiced things up with a bit of deli mustard which accentuated the tastiness of the pastrami. I believe this pastrami is house made and they completely nail the balance of savory, salty, smoky flavors. The ultra thin slicing ensures a delicate texture but the meat doesn't fall apart or turn to mush. The rye bread is an amazing compliment with just the perfect sponginess though the crumb and a solid but not crunchy crust. The size is generous but not over the top and allows the flavors to balance one another. Really excellent dish!

Potato Pancakes - Not latkes, but quite close, these guys were also excellent. I ordered two for my son and we all ended up trying them. Much like a traditional latke these were served with rich sour cream and a sweet spiced apple sauce on the side. There's a bit of onion flavor in the pancakes but they're held together with a flour based batter. Thin and very crispy on the edges, these were excellent! 

Pickled beets - These were a really nice side. Very sweet with just the right balance of acidity from the pickling. I actually liked them best with a sprinkling of salt and black pepper, but there were great as served as well. The texture was firm but giving, just like you'd expect from a well prepared beet. 

Iced tea - Fresh brewed, bottomless, delicious!

We also picked up a challah on the way out, but I haven't broken into that quite yet. There was an impressive beer selection both on tap and in bottle (MANY more bottles than taps) and a very tempting bloody mary as well as dessert (which we skipped on this visit). As I said above, this was my first visit but will certainly not be my last; one of my new favorites in the increasingly awesome Attwood neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stalzy's is simply amazing. I think they have both the best reuben and the best fish fry I've ever had. I try to try other things there too, but those two are so good it is hard to order anything new! Great problem to have! :) My husband loves to pretend he is a competitive eater and get a triple decker every once in a while, but honestly the regular sandwiches are so big I can't even finish one of them! They do accept cards but prefer cash, and the sandwiches are ala cart so add a side if you are expecting one. They also offer meats and bread and beer sundries. I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Stalzy's is that they stick to the basics but they do them really well. The menu may not sound super impressive in comparison to the prices but when you get your meal the quality is superb. These sandwiches are made with quality, local ingredients and with the above average drink selection they really provide the deli experience I expect. Dont let the simple titles fool you this top notch food is worth of your lunch(or breakfast) hour any day.

My sandwich of choice is the ham and swiss, simple, delectable, delicious :)"}
{"text":"Only been here once, but was not as impressed as people hyped it up to be. Sandwiches were small as far as typical deli sandwiches go. Both my and my wife's sandwiches were overly greasy. 

Pluses were the Bloody Mary (according toy wife), the outdoor seating, and the service. I got a melty first trip but will try more of a traditional deli sandwich like corned beef next time."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.
Only place in Madison where you feel like you are at an authentic NYC diner.  They won Madison's best sandwich for a reason; IT'S THE BEST!  They won for their Rachel, which is a Ruben but with slaw instead of kraut and pastrami instead of corn beef. But you can get it what ever way you like.  
My favorite is the Hawkwind burger with a side of house made coleslaw.  This way you can dip the side of chips into the slaw.
Stalzy's is artistic in their approach and make everything to order, so don't go if you are in a hurry.  Slow food movement at its finest!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Stalzy's. I tried the Corso, their Friday special. It's a great deli sandwich with a ton of flavor. They later on hefty portions of deli meat. The bread is fresh and light with a crunch. You can tell it's homemade. This was a great sandwich that was light and fresh. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday, and had a great experience.  

Food 4.5/5
Atmosphere 3/5
Price 4/5 (the quality's there to justify higher than average prices).

Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef and pastrami combo......... I didn't know what meat was which... The meat was tough and so salty it sent my blood pressure into the stroke zone.  NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint deli with a private parking lot.  While there isn't a lot of seating they do have counter space if you don't get the chance to find a table after you order.   However, this lovely deli is well worth a visit.  Ordering is easy as the menu is displayed on a chalkboard above the counter.  

Everything is fresh.  Bread is crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside and then you add your meats.  The smell of the rotisserie and smoked meats make your mouth water as you patiently wait (only a short time) for your food.  There is a large cooler of lovely drinks to choose from, desserts as well.  

The decor is pleasant with beautiful original paintings from a local artist who painted in France.  The staff is kind and the place has a calm, cheery vibe to it.  Well worth a stop."}
