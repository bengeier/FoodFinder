{"text":"Saw the picture of these pancake looking burgers and had to come and try them. The menu is simple and it is lathered in this light chile sauce. The bread is thin yet crispy and pancake looking. Yummy burger but one cannot fill you up. We ordered a side of poutine and it also had the special sauce. Glad I tried it and so should you!"}
{"text":"Dic Ann's is a Quebec classic and this is one of the very best in my opinion. I think it was actually opened by the franchise owners in the 90's but the vibe is perfect, homey 60's small town diner. A tribute to the original couple, Dick and Ann, who fell in love and dreamed of opening a hamburger spot and moved to Montreal's east end in the 50s and made their dream come true. I love the gold and orange glass lamps over every table, and I love the burnt orange diner seats, the faux stone counter top, and the fact that the place always seems completely full of locals hanging out, and digging into the classic flat burgers and crispy fries and gooey poutines. Cover everything in the homemade hot sauce, and everything is ok."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Dic Ann's since I was a kid, my father first brought me to the Laval location in 1981 and I have loved it ever since. I remember Dic and Anne from the Pie-IX and Laval location very well, the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. They had an extremely high standard for cleanliness and it's nice to see that the franchise owner here in Saint Jerome have extremely high standards of cleanliness as well. If you are one of the few people in Quebec who have not eaten at Dic Ann's, then you are missing out."}
