{"text":"Maybe good if you're in a pinch, but mediocre food

Been twice now for take-out. We tried the gyoza (deep fried vs. pan fried - I didn't like them) and the California roll (it was alright).

I returned recently and tried the California rice bowl - essentially a deconstructed Cali roll in a bowl. It was OK, except that I didn't particularly like the mayo sauce they kind of doused it with. It was too much for my taste.

So far, my experience here has been quite average. They do offer value meal options everyday; I think for some, this place is good if you're in a pinch. But I haven't been thrilled by the food."}
{"text":"This place is set up very much like a fast food place and I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up becoming a chain. I ordered the Sunday special which is the steak bowl. The rice was done well. The vegetables still had some crunch. The sauces tasted good. But the steak was really dry and tough. I was actually very surprised how long they took to cook the meat. The meat is so thin that it should have been cooked for a minute on each side over a very hot grill. But all I could do was weep as the guy with the mohawk at the grill squeezed out every last bit of juice from my steak. The saving grace of this place is that it is pretty cheap, open late and right across the street from the hotel I was staying at."}
{"text":"Holy sweet mother of mercy. I am in love with the Japa Burger, yam fries and Kara-age bowl. It's like a trifecta of delicious arteriosclerosis and heartburn that are almost worth the painfully disgusting taste of Tums, Maalox or Pepto. I need more. Would eat here every other day if I could... Although my wallet & waistline might beat me upside the head with a sledgehammer. In spite of being the usual pig, I split every item with my sister that day (THANK GOD). 

Wanted to marry the rice in that Kara-age bowl. It was almost as good as, if not better than the rice I make at home in my $500 Cuckoo pressure cooker with precision-measured rice to water ratios. I am an insane stickler for perfectly cooked, deliciously chewy rice & will only make it when I'm home alone or have the kitchen to myself. What rice or cooker do you use, EkiBento? I could sleep with you for the answer.

However, the bright red julienned ginger (beni shoga) was an acrid pile of salt assault with no hint of sweet & sour flavour whatsoever. Sis & I thought it would taste bloody amazing so we eagerly heaped 2 huge tablespoons onto our burger & rice bowl. I guess we were expecting it to taste like those sweet pickled ginger slivers that accompany sushi (gari)... or did we simply arrive at a bad time? She was encouraged to get the 'red strings of death' due to a yumtastic ramen house experience in NYC. Felt so duped. LMFAO!

The yam fries were lightly coated in airy, translucent tempura batter & were crispy on the outside & mashed potatoey on the inside. We violently shaker-raped it with Japanese seven-spice powder (shichimi/nanami togarashi). I was shoving fistfuls of yam ciggies into my mouth at breakneck speeds. It was a miracle I saved any for my sister.

The Japa Burger was a glisteningly gorgeous teriyaki-flavoured mound of awesomeness. I loved the mayo* they used (was it the yolk-rich Japanese Kewpie mayo?). The bun was a borderline kaiser-type affair. I think it was of an exceptional quality. It was also grilled. I need to dissect this burger next time I dine here so I can reconstruct this marvel at home.

*It was garlic sauce. Now I can't remember whether it was butter, cream or mayo-based. Goddamnit!"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried has been amazing, from the basic california rolls to various hand rolls! Walking distance to Ryerson University. My friends and I came around lunch time and the place was packed, the sushi was quickly prepared though. We would definitely consider going here instead of any other sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"I just came here for takoyaki. There aren't many stores that I can find within a convenient distance to me that carry them. This is the closest one to me.

At $4 for 6 pieces, it's the cheapest place out of the three locations that I've been to (Manpuku in recent weeks, Guu a long while ago). They all offer 6 pieces, but the sizes here seem smaller than the ones at Manpuku. I think Guu's sizes were larger too, so you're getting what you pay for I guess.

Rather than sprinkling bonito flakes on the takoyaki, this place has veggies (green onions?) mixed into the batter. I was expecting the former, but it's not bad if you don't mind the taste. It had the mayo and tonkatsu sauce drizzled, and overall it was still delicious.

It's about a 20 minute wait for these elsewhere, but I think I waited 5 minutes in total here. I tip my hat to the fast service. 

I can't comment on the other food here, but if you're craving for some takoyaki and this place is close by, give it a try."}
{"text":"I was downtown and hunger hit me.  I started traveling north up Yonge and then stumbled upon this place right after the Gerrard intersection.  I'm usually picky when it comes to meat at a cheap price but I have to say this place really does deliver with quality at a great price. I tried the marinated beef bowl and it was amazing, the beef was mouth watering and the bowl was jam packed with fresh fried veggies and rice, I've been back for seconds since. Their sushi rolls are also very mouth watering and made fresh and fast. My most favorite off their menu is the Philadelphia roll which is a California roll with cream cheese added and then covered with smoked salmon, DELICIOUS!!! They also offer a nice selection of udon noodle bowls and bento boxes, which bring a great value for the price.  Overall I had a great experience at this hidden gem and recommend it to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Not bad but has a strong fast food feel. Walked in for some a japanese food fix. Their 'sumo' (larger) version of dishes is not worth it imho."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick tasty meal. 
Awesome beef ribs.

Beautiful decor for an \"express\" type restaurant too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great spot for good quality Japanese food that's very reasonably priced and delicious! It's very clean here, service was fast, friendly and nice. 

Try it!"}
{"text":"Popped in on a whim. Wanted something quick and relatively healthy (and was tired of Teriyaki Express) & got exactly that!

I got salmon plate, was almost more than I could eat & it wasn't even Sumo Sized. Great value, super fresh and delicious. Also sampled the takoyaki -- so, so tasty. Do give it a try!

Staff were all super nice, too.

Have gone back a couple times now. Have been consistently impressed each time.

The ambiance is very \"fast food\" -- artificial lighting that's a little too bright, generic mass-produced wall art, etc. -- but it's supposed to be that way.

Will totally keep coming back.

They now do phone ahead pickup orders. Ryerson students get 10% off w/ student card. Also, check website for good monthly specials."}
{"text":"Utterly unimpressed and disappointing
Uninspired food
had a short rib bowl (Kalbi don I presume?), thought it was insipid, soy sauce and sugar with tonnes of cabbage and mushroom, way below anything from Japan, or that you could get in a decent restaurant
nothing Korean or Japanese tasting in it. this is the same low level of quality as those other pseudo-japanese chains in Canada
They also refused to honour their promotion, which didnt impress either
Didnt eat the whole thing, would recommend against"}
{"text":"I've got your picture of me and you 
You wrote \"I love you\" I wrote \"me too\"
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh there's plenty a-fish to go around 
The chefs are all busy and loud 
I often eat the curried bento when there's no one else around

I've got your picture, I've got your picture 
I hit \"like\" a million times on facebook on my cell
I want another of your picture 
So as I eat I can look at you from inside as well 
You've got me turning up and turning down 
And turning in and turning 'round 

I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese

---------------------------------

\"Fast  Japanese Food\" better than the food court ones at Yum Yum prices.  There needs to be more of these places.  Acceptable bento boxes.. and oodles of noodles."}
{"text":"This place is super fast when preparing the order. The food is amazing! They have a daily special for $5.49. Its a lot of food for me, I usually eat half during lunch then half during last break at work lol. My favourite is Tuesday which is the Teriyaki Chicken. Its in a bowl with Japanese rice veges  and chicken. I'm getting hungry right now lol. Can't wait til Tuesday! They also have a points monkey card where you accumulate points with ever purchase and you can redeem for free stuff/food."}
{"text":"The ultimate philosophy of Eki-Bento is to provide Japanese style of Fast Food Restaurant. In Japan, Eki-Bento (or Eki-Ben) means boxed meals sold in train stations, often provided to people who are going to travel long distance.  This restaurant provides exact same concept. Their food are contained in Plastic boxes, where you could take home or dine in. To get the full feeling of eating an Eki-Bento, I suggest you could buy one of their daily specials on your way home after work and eat it in TTC.

I would definitely come back to get more of this.

ENVIRONMENT:
The interior of this place looks like McDonald's or Burger King. This place doesn't really provide the feeling of a Japanese Restaurant. Which is good because Eki-Bento is a fast food place after all.

FOOD:
Me and my friend ordered
1. Chicken Teriyaki Bowl
2. Marinated Beef Bowl

First of all, Chicken Teriyaki Bowl was very yummy. The combination of teriyaki sauce and texture of Chicken Teriyaki was perfect.

Second of all, Marinated Beef Bowl really had flavor. It was very juicy.

Last of all, the size of their Bowls is huge for it's price!

PRICE:
Chicken Teriyaki Bowl was only $5.49 (Due to special) and my friend couldn't even finish half of it
Marinate Beef Bowl was $6.49, wow it was a big portion for the price!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken bowl, mmm!
Dynamite roll, yum!  
Yam fries, super yum!"}
{"text":"Located just north of Gerrard and Yonge, Eki-Bento is a shop that is easy to walk by, given the loads of construction across the street, and its location (in which previously was some kind of noodle place that didn't do well).

I've been pondering going here for at least a week. It's located very close to work, so it would be an easy place to add to my regular routine, but nothing on the menu really stood out to me. Still, on my way back to work during my break, I decided to give it a go.

I ended up going with a Chicken Karage Bento Box, which includes Chicken, steamed/grilled vegetables, rice, salad and a Gyoza. With a drink, it ran me just over $11, par for the course in terms of lunch in the core. As I waited, I checked out the place. Previously, the restaurant here was nothing short of a dump. This place was quite nice, newly renovated, nice area for sitting down and very large windows to let in the light. They have a glass enclosed flat top grill and a bunch of stations to serve at but you have to walk around the corner to get your food. It's cool cause you can watch your food being made but there really wasn't much of that going on since most of it was pre-prepared.

First off, there's quite a bit of food here for the price. The rice portion was huge, there were lots of veggies and quite a good amount of chicken. It was nicely presented and when I got back to work, still rather hot.

The salad was fine, nothing special but a nice addendum to the meal. The rice was fine as well but its rice and that's pretty hard to screw up. The Gyoza was boring, it got super salty partway through, but it was tasty enough I suppose. And then the veg and chicken. They put a bunch of steamed/grilled veg on the bottom and then put the chicken on top and then add two sauces on top of the chicken. The chicken itself? Pretty good, thin batter, crispy and at first the sauce was good. But by the end of it, the sauce was kinda gross. I think this was one of those meals where I was initially impressed, having had low expectations, and then that wore off as I ate. Same thing with the veg, looked good but it was soggy, there was too much liquid with it and it lacked flavor. Besides, all the liquid from the veg got soaked up by the chicken and a lot of the sauce on the chicken sort of dissipated into the liquid-y veg.

Overall, I was disappointed by this place. It looked promising but the mixed reviews really do tell a tale of a place that's right for some and not for others. I doubt I'll be back here; although the prices were good, the entire meal was rather salty, so much so that my tongue feels a tad funny. Not a bad stop if you want cheap okay-ish food, but this one will not make my rotation and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Bento and Udon and Tempura, oh my!

This place was great!  We went here for lunch today, and it was really nice.  Clean and big, friendly, and the food was super good.  My husband got a beef teriyaki bento, and I got a tempura udon with an avocado roll on the side.

The udon broth was perfect and tasty as heck!  The noodles were freshly boiled (I watched!) and the green onions and everything on top were fresh too.  The tempura was nice and crispy and made while we were there.  Really good stuff!  The roll was exactly right - the avocado was perfectly ripe, with just enough ginger and wasabi on the side.  We had ginger ales on the side and were plenty full for a little over $20.

Definitely going to return.  We are pleased to see they got on just-eat.ca recently, too.  We only live a couple blocks away so it's not a necessity for us, but for those reallllly lazy days, you never know. =)  Their menu is smaller than some, but it certainly seems to make sure that they know how to do everything well!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place out for the first time. It opened recently so I expect quality to be at its highest point. I got the chicken karaage bowl. I've never actually had karaage (fried chicken in japanese style condiments) but it was pretty decent. Still the portions are a bit small for the price you pay. The food came out in less than 2 minutes, and the atmosphere is modern but casual."}
{"text":"From the sound of the reviews this place has upped the prices and lowered the portions recently. The inside was clean and laid out well with new tables and chairs. I got the California Salmon Sashimi Bowl. The bowl came well presented, even if in a plastic bowl on a tray. The bowl consisted of raw salmon chunks, avocado, krab meat, and julianne cucumber over a bed of rice. It was garnished with tobiko (fish eggs) sliced nori, and ginger ($9.00). It was edible, however the sashimi was not firm and a bit slimy with bits of skin on it. I was also turned off by the sauce that was liberally poured over the bowl. White and brown, it tasted neither of sour cream/mayo or a soy/teriyaki. It just added another note of sliminess to the dish and made the fish therefore less appetizing. I had to throw it away 2/3 through eating it. Maybe I'll muster the courage to try something else there sometime but with all the competition in the area, it might be awhile."}
