{"text":"I love this place. Been here over 10 times Atleast once a month. Been to honey pig and Lee's Korean bbq & Hwaro is still #1. I'll keep this as my regular restaurant 2 times or more a month. If wife permits."}
{"text":"This place is the worst \"thing\" I've ever stepped in. I was told the wait time was 30 minutes, waited for an hour to be seated with no one checking on us, when finally our turn to sit down we waited for another 5 minutes till someone came to ask if we were ready to order. The sides were dry and it seemed like they've been sitting for some time. We order a beer and when the waiter returned and he handed us glasses they had lipstick on the rim. While being grossed out we order our check and looked at us like seriously? (Are you honestly surprised)They honestly have no idea what customer service and quality is. All I wanted was to enjoy a nice dinner and I couldn't even do that. Please if you have other options immediately cross this one off. TRUST ME YOU WONT BE MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING!!!!!"}
{"text":"( MUST TRY ) THE SHIT !!! FOREALZ FOREALZ !!! Everything else should be called the same thing!! Ahaha cuss everything u take a bite of ur like yup this is the shit ! AHAHAHA"}
{"text":"Everytime...we stop by  BBQ shirt rib was awesome as always  Got the line but not so long. We do enjoys bbq tonight. Ps don't forget cone cheese. And don't forget Afargarto fit last bite I cream topped with coffee koreas style sooooo gooooood."}
{"text":"Very bad bad bad Korea bbq!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The beef is not taste like beef! The pork belly taste so worst!!!!!! And no service no water refill!!!! When We wanna order 2 more plates, the server just told us that's enough!!!! Shit!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great but service needs improvement.  The servers are always in a hurry to serve."}
{"text":"The service is good and the quality of the food is way better than the Korean BBQ we've had. One of the best, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had a great time with my homies, even met some new homies. Came straight from work to relax, definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Recommended by friends from Hawaii. They raved about this place.    Saturday afternoon, dining alone.  They don't take single diners.   Was willing to pay double due to friends review, talked to owner.  Was refused for service.  Also, not too friendly.   Wanted to to post no stars."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars!! Tried this place for the first time, walking in feels like a legit korean bbq place.. I already had that feeling within that I was gonna enjoy today's experience.  We got brisket, beef tounge, ribye, tripe and baby octopus Overall it was good, good selection of meats, the baby octopuswas good which my husband enjoyed.  They have a variety of sauces served at your table depending on your preference.  The salad was good but not as good as tofu Hut's salad.  LOVE that they changed our grill 2x without having to ask them.    Cons: If you love tripe (like the one from tofu hut which is sadly my favorite) you'd be very dissapointed because what they served us was something i've never seen before.. It was huge like a sausage link and had fat inside so I was very bummed they don't have the tripe that I'm used to at other korean bbq places... :("}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Friendly environment . Lots of different choices to eat I love the brisket . One of the best Korean bbq please I been too"}
{"text":"What a great all you can eat spot!! Our party of 3 went on a Saturday around 5pm. We had to wait but maybe about 15 mins or so, it wasn't too bad. We did the all day special. I got the shake shake rice but was pretty underwhelmed with the dish. The shit on the other hand was delicious.  Overall great experience. The only con I would say is that it gets  hot in there because of the grills. They could improve their ventilation over the grills just a little bit. Would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas! I'm already preferential to all gastronomical Asian concepts... but Korean food is my kriptonite! And this place knocks it out of the park! Seamless service to boot! Worth the long wait to get a table once you arrive."}
{"text":"It's alright. Our grill wasn't hot enough so the food wasn't cooking as fast as it should. I started to get full eating the side dishes while waiting for the meat to cook. The staff was nice in accommodating us by changing us to another table with proper grill. Once the food started cooking, it was good. Short ribs were good. My friends had the octopus but thought it was too sweet."}
{"text":"Great place.  Delicious korean BBQ.  Nice service. Enjoyed our family lunch here.  It was recommended by a family member.   We would definitely come back again the next time we are on our Las Vega vacation."}
{"text":"The worst customer service! From the time we sat the table, not even one server acknowledge us. We had to ask the busser to send one our way. After all the waiting, food made it on our table and when the server was asked for more food she disgustingly said she will be right back as shes busy. Even soda took long to be brought in our table. Decided to order more food, the food was never delivered to us. At that point could not help myself but say something, i told the server how poor their service is. She came back with the check and proudly addressed \"as a courtesy i took this off your check\" guess... A $1.50 soda was taken out of the check! -- first of all when i tell someone how bad your service is, that doesn't mean i am out to get anything for free! I take my family out to enjoy our meal and not to get something for free! Take guests comments to improve your service! This is our first and last time in this place. Consider how filthy this place is, i will remember to send the health inspector your way for random check after shes done signing Grade A for my place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! It's late hours are even better for those touring around Las Vegas and want some Korean BBQ! It's a small venue but it comes with great food and great service! Would come again and again! Doing a review also gets you a choice of a free beer or a choice of a sofa drink! :)"}
{"text":"I went here by myself to eat kbbq. Being new in town I don't have anybody to eat with. So I come in and I said I'm dining alone. He looked around and said, \" you will have to wait\". Ok fine. Then 15 mins later the waiter comes to me and said that they can't accept 1 person for the kbbq, but is offering me the 1 and only soup entree they have. Why let me wait to say they don't accept only 1 person, plus there's nothing in their restaurant that says so. Nothing that  says it has to be more than 1 person for the kbbq. This restaurant has excellent customer service to the max!!! I'm only giving 1 star coz I can't remove it already. But it is zero star!   I went to another kbbq  restaurant instead and it has an option for 1 person for the bbq. Expensive but worth it to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"Best place for KBBQ In Las Vegas! I come here once a week..... excellent service and quality !"}
{"text":"This food made all 3 of my friends extremely sick, one of them is a chef and after he cooked the beef we all are and started hurling"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. $22.95 per person for AYCE. Came with the hubby. Food is fantastic. We ordered the Hwaro premium steak, skirt steak, short ribs, pork belly, bean paste soup, and the shake shake rice. All delicious. I really enjoyed the bean paste soup. Dessert is included in the AYCE (ice cream- vanilla or green tea) or affogato- vanilla with Korean coffee. Highly recommend. We will return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Really good salad and side dishes very reasonable price for AYCE. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great and the setup is wonderful. Service was normal and the wait time was crazy long. Waited 40 minutes but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in town. Love to come here!!! Best meat & best price ! Tried so many KBBQ , but this one is the best!"}
{"text":"All you can eat are yummy and fast, the shake shake rice are just like what it said, you shake then eat, healthy and tasteful"}
{"text":"Everything was great especially service was mucho mucho bueno.  There is a lot of choices of meats and most are awesome. I should go agian and try more things"}
{"text":"good meats, good beats, good eats.   my go to kbbq place because of the great service and fresh selection."}
{"text":"Service is moderate and the meat tastes great. The rice paper happens to be dry though. Otherwise a great experience for the price"}
{"text":"One of my favorites awce Korean bbq places.   The service is good and the food choices are just what I look for in Korean bbq.  Just one word of warning, if you're going other places after eating here be prepared to smell like bbq for the rest of the day!  Give it a try it's very yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! This is my second time comig here, foods great, service is great, price is cheap!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going if it's only yourself they won't serve individuals. Seems like discrimination to me."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly! Good all you can eat menu and perfect spot for late night. Cool the meats yourself to your own temperature  yummy"}
{"text":"Awesome food, all you can eat! That also includes a dessert The affogato is amazing. Doesn't get to smokey like traditional BBQs."}
{"text":"This was only my second time eating korean bbq and it was absolutely amazing! I love how you get to cook your own food! I love meats and they give you so much to choose from!!"}
{"text":"This place is completely disorganized and chaotic. Second time my boyfriend and I try going and people there do not know what they are doing. Will. Never. Ever. Attempt to go here again. If you want to get looked at funny instead of getting food, then come here."}
{"text":"I went to a new Korean Barbeque restaurant, named Hwaro. It was new Korean restaurant around town. I found out it was hot on the yelp. It was near the china town on Spring Mountain. In the complex of the restaurant, there was famous Ramen restaurant, Monta, boba tea café, Kung-fu Café and etc. There were so many cars in the parking lot since there were many good restaurants. When I walked into the restaurant, I could feel that the place was really popular. Every tables had grills and already filled with customers. There was no bar or other rooms to be private. It had several tables with blinds. I ordered beef tongue and pork belly for my order. I grilled myself for the meats. I love to have rare medium for my beef meat. Especially, beef tongue was really thin, so I had to grill them quickly. Beef tongue was chewy and lighter than other beef part. It smelt a little bit, but it didn't really distract me. Next, I had pork belly. Pork is the meat that you have to cook it well-done. So I cooked well. It felt like thick bacon. It had its own smell from the pork meat, but still taste good. It tasted greasy and oily. It was such a great meat to have with drinks. Even though it takes some time to cook for yourself, but as new experience, Korean Barbeque is good one to have."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in town! A must go with reasonable price and friendly service .   Their brisket is the best! Go either late night or lunch for cheaper price!  Han is the best server ever!"}
{"text":"This place has well variety of me eat for a decent price. If you would like to get some kbbq come here."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best Korean BBQ AYCE restaurant i have been to.  Very reasonable price considering the quality and variety of food offered.  If you have a large party then be prepared to wait as they only have two tables that seat large groups.  Must try the shits and korean fried chicken.  End the meal with coffee poured over vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in town. The decor is what clean and inviting and the service is great. The selection of meats is incomparable and they had plenty of alcohol to choose from. The lunch is affordable, and the dinner is a steal $20. I would recommend"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and every time has been great.  The quality of the meat is pretty great, and they have some unique choice that other places don't have.  The customer service really sets it apart.  Jayden always gave amazing service.  Best customer service I've received at a kbbq restaurant ever!  I totally recommed this place: great prices and service as well as great meat quality!"}
{"text":"It is an all can you eat Korean BBQ, they can cater to a number of different parties, of various sizes. It's 20 dollars for all can you eat, with 16 dollars for the lunch and late dinner special. You are given a good number of sides \"kimchi, dikon, etc.\" and a bowl of rice, if you run out, you can ask for more. You pick what meats you want, and you cook it. In the table there is a grill for you to cook on. If the grill get to dirty/burned they will change it out with a new one. This place is great for long dinner, so don't of if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Good food as far as Korean BBQ. Will definitely come back and eat here when we come back to Las Vegas. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Our most favorite Korean buffet restaurant in Vegas! Amazing food and great service! We go here at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite korean all you can eat barbeque. I come here like once a month! the wait is long but is worth it! side dishes has very good selection. their meat is tender and service is the best!"}
{"text":"Food and price is great. But watch out if you have a party of 4 or more they add tip automatically I double  tipped them last time."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find this ayce Korean BBQ! First of all, everything is delicious and all the servers would always come by your table to check if you need anything, now that's real customer service!. I recommend this place if you're in Vegas and craving for good Korean food. They're even open late, I will keep coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a line when we entered, but servers were accommodating enough that it didn't take long for us to get seated. The place itself gives a comfortable feel since it's not too enclosed and the smell of smoke is unnoticeable. The menu is all-you-can-eat type of menu as it provides a variety of delicious meat and side dishes for you to choose from. Aside from that, they also provide a selection of Soju (In which in my opinion, is the best drink to have when eating the food)         I would recommend ordering Beef Brisket and Enoki Beef, since these were the two best ones that I've tried. I would keep coming back for more. Don't skip on the dipping sauce! It gives the meat even more of a great flavor. If you are a fan of grilling, this is a great place to be since they let you cook your own food.        The service was good since they were friendly and they did their job in a orderly manner. They were diligent when changing the grill for us. Compared to other kbbq resturants that I've been to, Hwaro is the best one."}
{"text":"So me and my party originally planned to eat at tofu hut. But ofcourse because of the long line, we decided to come over at hwaro instead which I found on yelp. And it being new, I told my friends we should try it out! As soon as we got there, we were seated right away. We opt for the 19.99 ayce. We ordered Baby octopus, pork skin, short ribs, sliced rib eye, brisket, and more!! Our server was very friendly, attentive and accomodating. Our experience was great and food is awesome, even the water. Im surprised their water is NOT tap water!! The meat were marinated perfectly. The pork skin and the sliced rib eye....ughhh i cant get enough of them. Will definitely come back!!  I knocked a star off because my cousin's chair was dirty when we got to the table so she had to exchange it herself with another chair from the table right  next to us...lol"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Good quality meats and poultry with traditional banchan (the kimchee is perfectly aged!) AND all you can eat?!!! My favorite was the \"Fat Ass\" which is wine marinated pork belly and the steamed egg! I couldn't get enough of both! The service was very attentive with all the staff and we never went without!! Everyone was so nice and smiling all the time! They even changed out our grill plate twice so we could keep going! The place filled up fast and even though it's a small restaurant, it felt comfortable. We are coming back for more very soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Food should be on the Food Network for best Korean BBQ!!! Will for sure come back!!!"}
{"text":"Probly one of my favorite places. I didn't get to post all of the photos. There is a long wait time but this time we were lucky enough to be 3rd on the list. This is a place you wanna go they are super fast with everything you order and never forget to bring a what you ask for!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite Korean BBQ spots. We usually visit after 10 PM to take advantage of the late night special ($16.99). The Shit and bulgogi nachos are so addicting. The quality of the meat is pretty good, too, and for such a good price.   The only things I don't like about this place: -The water pitchers they leave at the table only fill about a cup and a half...you might have to ask for more pitchers a few times.  -The floor tends to be...slippery and greasy? -Parking can be a challenge, because the location has several other popular restaurants, but if you're lucky, you might get some help finding a spot."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Cute cozy spot, long lines on a Sunday night but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat will be back staff are very friendly nice atmosphere. Clean and fast service."}
{"text":"This place is cool good meat and good service....!!! Even love the Korean musics. My friends and I really having fun eating here."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Recommend it to anyone looking for great Korean BBQ! Definitely coming here everyone I come to visit Las Vagas."}
{"text":"Incredible! Didn't have one item we asked for but we really enjoyed the food. The meat was excellent and sides were good also.  Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"They refused to serve me because I was alone even though there was only two people in the entire restaurant. Will never go back to this place again especially since there are so many better and more accommodating places around China Town."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was A1. Everyone besides the server was cool. I don't know if she's the owner or whatever, but she had the worst stink face ever. Every time she came around to change the grilltop, she would lift the top with our food that was cooking on it and gave us this disgust look to make us take it off. Never said a word to us. I work and everyone I know work in the industry so it's completely unacceptable. Oh yeah, I came in with a party of 5, she auto-gratted the bill off top. If I had the change I would've gave the tip to the support staff. But seeing she needed the money that bad. We just paid the bill. Pathetic. Shout out to the support team though. They killed it. Lady server, get off your high horse and show appreciation for people who give you business. And if you're so sour and salty all the time. Find another job."}
{"text":"There's a lot of competition in LV for Korean AYCE BBQ- all within a short drive of here.   Frankly, you are better off going to one of the other places than here.  This place won't be around long anyways- not with other choices available.  All of the recent and more decorative pictures 'under new management'?  Don't expect that sort of decorative frippery.  Maybe you'll get your brisket, maybe it'll just be sliced ribeye.  It's not certain of what it will be, or actually when it will be. Certainly not the fancy plates of meat with garnish and cucumber.    I'm typically pretty indifferent to indifferent service, but here was past the limit- apparently they are following the 'One Restaurant, One Waitress' motto of service.  While the owner(s) stand idly by at the cash register doing next to nothing, the one server is either busy preparing the food (as she vanishes to the depths of the kitchen for upwards of 10 minutes) or running back and forth in a panic.   Walked in- quickly led to the table- In the water glasses, the unwrapped straws looked lightly used.  Odd, ask the server once she came for new ones- she was a bit hesitant, but got new glass, still unwrapped straws.  Does *anyone* actually sell unwrapped food service straws in 2015?    Table fills with the complimentary appetizers- all of which are pretty good.    No cheese/corn as others have mentioned, maybe it's randomly available.   Server lights the grill.  Then lights it again.  Then again.  Asks me for a pair of chopsticks, which she then uses to hold open the gas valve.  Seems to hold- though I would question the wisdom of propping open gas valves with bamboo, but hey.  No chicken tonight, and we seem to be missing two of the items we requested, but that's just setting the pace for the rest of the meal.  The meats seem to be a bit random, though actually good when they are grilled.  After grilling a bit, it's natural the grill gets a bit black and nasty.  Time for a swap right?  NOPE.  Time for the server to wipe it with your napkin.  Swipe, off goes your dirty napkin, and onto the grill.  Your own napkin, not a clean one, my own messy napkin.  Yep, cleans it just as good as you would expect a paper napkin on a sticky flaming hot grill does.  Nothing but paper everywhere. From somewhere she procures a wet wipe and tries again.  Nastylicious.  I have never, never ever seen this before, and never expect to again.    The server gets the idea this wiping business is less than ideal, and actually gets a new grill.    Next time it looks a bit black, same exact thing happens.  Yoink goes my own dirty napkin, and she wants to wipe it off.  How cheap, nasty, gross and weird is this? Would *I* do that to my own cooking, or would I be a clean person like my mother taught me to be?   And if they do this at your table, where you can see it, what about where you can't see, in the kitchen?  Each serving requested is smaller than the last, and takes longer to arrive.  The last order took over ten minutes, when only 4 tables had people.  Not a person in sight, I could have walked out and no one would have noticed.  This is the death bell for any AYCE place.  Once they start doing this small but extremely important activity, it  signals the owners cheapness (as if the unwrapped straws and grill-napking wiping weren't enough)- lack of caring, and impending doom of the establishment.   Raise the price if you need to, but you know what?  It's AYCE.  In VEGAS.  You have 10 places within walking distance who will not do that and are waiting for someone else to blink.  Here's the kicker- the food actually is decent.  In the end, it doesn't matter, there are way better choices to choose from, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here and it was really good! We live in dallas and it's the best one we have ever tasted! Our waiter was very attentative and very friendly! Will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've never been disappointed with the food or the service. The wait is sometimes long but it's worth the wait. And the the pricing is amazing!! 19.99 for AYCE that's outrageously good. This is my go to Korean bbq spot and I think it always will be. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We came to this place for lunch on Memorial Day at 1:00 and there was one waitress serving around 8 tables by the time we got there. The waitress didn't even acknowledge us when we entered. It took twenty minutes to get us seated, with 2 parties leaving by that time.  She served our water, side dishes, and had our stove set up by the time we spent an HOUR there. By 2:06 pm, we didn't receive our meat at all. Yet as I observed the other tables, other parties had their meat delivered and the last item delivered was our sauces. After trying to satisfy our hunger by eating all the side dishes, we decided we had enough of the wait and wanted to leave. The waitress didn't even try to fix things and just let us go. Way to make us feel like we mattered at all.   This is my first time at a KBBQ with such horrible customer service as this. How is it that it is taking us a FULL HOUR to get us started when the place wasn't even full house? At first we thought it was because there was only a single waitress taking care of the floor, but how she managed to get us started was unnecessarily slow. It didn't make sense why she had to serve us our water and sides at 10 minute intervals and not get our meat and stove started. We went over to another KBBQ place after that and managed to get seated, get our meat, and finish our meal within the next full hour. Compare that. We all thought Hwaro would be great because of the previous yelp reviews but our time was WASTED on this place. We tried to be patient. We really did. That's why we were foolish enough to spend an hour on service that ignored us from the beginning.   I do not recommend going to this place, unless you want to be ignored and treated poorly. 1/2 a star."}
{"text":"great price and they give u enough condiment with ur meal...good atmosphere...only thing was where we sat it was too hot no air circulation...especially wen ur doing d grill"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price you pay! 4 stars because the wait time. Also, there are about 4 or 5 tables that go to waste because they don't have vents over them."}
{"text":"2nd timer! Great food! Great drinks! Great service! Great atmosphere! Good times with good friends!  Best korean bbq in town!  Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Harland is the shit :)  better server than anyone the food is amazing and with your service, it made it even better"}
{"text":"So, this is definitely one of the better late night budget korean BBQ's open.   Working in the business I get out late and don't have much options when craving BBQ, but this place does just fine.  The meats are good, they have added a few more items the past couple months. (Probably due to all the competition of other BBQ joints popping up around here)   The brisket, spicy skirt steak, & shake shake rice is my favorites here. What makes the brisket gold is their sauce though.   However, the 4 star comes from their service. I've been coming here for almost half a year and the crew they had before with the older lady and couple servers were sweet and efficient.   The past couple months I don't see them anymore, and there's one particular individual that just seems off every time I've been here since. Tall skinny korean guy just stares at you once you walk through the door. No greetings, and just points at the sign in sheet. I've seen him work too, no urgency, nonchalantly walking/looking around.   Smile bro."}
{"text":"it's our first time here. food is good but server is rude...and 1 steamed egg per table?  so that means 5 people has to share ???"}
{"text":"First time ever being here. So far everything is amazing . Waitress is very kind. Hot tea is wonderful! The place is very clean and the music they are playing is very calming! Recommend this place to everyone 5 starts all the way!"}
{"text":"I lived in Seoul years ago and became an instant fan of Korean food.  Once you've had it from the source, you will always look for the best place in town.  A good indicator for me has always been the number of Koreans that dine there.  On the night we went, Hwaro was full and we were the only non-Koreans in the place.  I knew it would be good and it did not disappoint!    The food was very good and plentiful.  Service was great.  It made me feel like I was back in the Korean countryside for a couple of hours.  Will gladly go back!"}
{"text":"I visited Hwaro for Friday night and they told me to wait 40minutes and i waited more than a hour and a half to be seated. They only had three chairs inside of the restaurant and they were only one single bench out side of its restaurant too. I sat on the aspalt cuzi was so tired of waiting and the weather was just ridiculous. Also the food wasn't that great. The quality of food was not that good either. The service was okay but overall i didnt really like it. If u r just looking for a cheap all u can eat korean barbeque go ahead."}
{"text":"We always come here because taste so gooooood !  Its different from other Korean BBQ restaurant ! Great service . Always have a good time !"}
{"text":"Decent spacing inside so wait times aren't too bad (if there is). For the cost & the quality of the food, you definitely get what you pay for. I'd say the lunch special is the best deal. You cook your own meat here. Good variety of meats and appetizers if it's a first visit. If you love sweet anything, go for the bulgogi nachos! And maybe some soju. My favorite was the jalapeño garlic pork belly   The service was great, always replacing the grill.  Parking in this plaza, we all know is a pain, so good luck. If the wait time for another place is ridiculous, might come back here to try other things."}
{"text":"Good service and food will be back for more good price and a great experience overall . Good music plays in the background. The smells make you crave more"}
{"text":"Awesome place, super fresh meat and great sides.  They also had a really good selection of meats and everything was available for dinner"}
{"text":"I actually didn't eat here but to offer a little advice. I went there alone and  after waiting on a list was told they cant serve just one person. so if you are going alone dont expect service. was referred to this place as being good though."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a good rating I really do! My friend recommended we eat at this place because of the low price, which was a plus; however I guess we went at a busy hour cause we had to wait for almost 2 hours to get seated. What really pissed me off was that we were standing around near the exit and noticed other people were sitting at tables that didn't have the grill. 1 hour in we asked if we could sit there and that's when they tell us that those are the \"waiting tables.\" would've loved to know that an hour earlier. When we finally were seated it took forever to take out order and it was so hard to get a waiter cause they would always walk past us really fast. It my friend ordered a dish 3 times and they finally got her order to her when we were leaving. The food wasn't that's great and the service was mediocre but I won't grade too harshly on the service because it was crowded. If your looking for a cheap KBBQ place this is it but that's about it.   All my friends and I can agree that were not going back to that place."}
{"text":"Foods are very delicious. Servers are very nice. If you want to eat Korean BBQ, please come to Hwaro!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Wait time was 30mins, which was fine since it was a weekend night. But they stuck us in a corner and forgot about us. We had to get up and roam around to find them so we can order more meat and refill the water. The basically forgot we were there. Also didn't get any tongs or scissors to cut and flip the food. So it stayed on the grill would almost burn.   Not worth your time and money! I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience with awesome service, love being able to come here and enjoy time with friends. The atmosphere is awesome, I would for sure recommend anybody and everybody to come."}
{"text":"This is a great place for party. We came here for Christmas Eve. Service is very nice here. Many selections on the menu. Love steam eggs. Love BBQ rib BBQ belly. Love kimchee. Love"}
{"text":"Best korean bbq restaurant!!:)). Good :)!  U try all u can eat !! I love Skirt steak and short ribs!!"}
{"text":"The waiting was long, but it was Christmas Eve so whatever. Everything was great but I feel like they are understaffed. We can see that they were tired, but they handle it very well. I like the sauce here, cute little place to dine in."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love the brisket, pork belly and pork cheek. The crews are very nice and friendly, they help us a lot. I go here often"}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again. They don't have all the sides shown in the pictures and NO CORN! Meet was ok, not that great, I'd rather go to TOFU HUT!"}
{"text":"Came in around 1AM on a friday night and waited about 30 minutes to get seated. I would recommend The Shit, the brisket with side of salt/pepper/sesame oil and cheese fondue! Also had prompt service even though it's late already. Coming from the Bay Area/San Francisco, I would definitely come back and recommend this place when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean bbq spots in Vegas! Pricing for the meal isn't bad either. Great when you're ready to stuff yourself lol  My favorite thing to get is the enoki beef! Must try!"}
{"text":"Really good korean bbq (samgyeopsal) buffet in town!! The price goes down to $19.99 by 10pm  also, they have variety of bbq choices. Average waiting period is 20-30 mins if it's before 10pm."}
{"text":"We were spoiled. We came here first. So when we went to the other restaurant...maybe we expected too much. The service here was amazing. Sammie and Jacob (there was one more but I can't remember her name) were amazing and super attentive. They worked as a team to meet our every need and they definitely went above and beyond the call of duty to provide amazing service. We had a group of over 15 people and they never made us wait too long for anything we asked for....we asked for a lot too!   If you're going to go to ANY KBBQ place in LV, this is the one to go too. The menu prices were much more reasonable, the service is spot on, the ambiance is fun (though if you're looking for a quiet place, it can get a little loud). The meat quality was pretty good for the price you were paying. The only thing I'd say was a little bit troublesome is that if you liked the baby octopus or enoki beef, they come in only limited supply. I wasn't torn up about that because I wanted the other selections a lot more. But being an AYCE place...these kinds of limitations just leave you a bit wanting."}
{"text":"Not even a one star if there is any...... Terrible service and horrible taste of food. Too salty,low quality of meat.  Never recommend to no one!!!! Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"There's the best BBQ Korean all you can eat ever!! Baby octopus mix with special spicy sauce is my favorite one."}
{"text":"Coming at night, had about a 30 minute wait.....despite that, it was so worth it!!!  Lots of choices, would definitely recommend the all-day special.  The short rib and brisket are awesome.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Best Kbbq in Vegas! Great atmosphere and wide selection from their appetizers to their bbq. My #1 go to for All You Can Eat Kbbq!"}
{"text":"Best place to go eat Korean BBQ, the food is superb and spectacular as well as its employees . Super friendly, chill environment with an amazing choice of music! Would definitely recommended coming here with the family if you are looking for a a kbbq place that's easier on the pockets :) Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE BBQ.  Good price, great meats, good side dish as well. Especially love green salad"}
{"text":"Long waiting but everything was awesome. Especially service is great. The girl server check if we need anything else and she was so nice.  Also there was bunch of choices that we can choose from the menu. Only 19.99 for everything that you want. Steam egg and the bean soup is one per table, but its reasonable as many of sushi places have one per persone orders. (Of you ask to server if you can have one more kindly, they will happy to give you) Everything was awesome there. Love Hwaro and obviously will be back. This place is top notch I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yelped for a ayce kbbq, long wait, but for a reason, the meat is exceptional and worth it. Fresh and tasty, thank you!"}
{"text":"It was good. Went since we moved out of California where we had kbbq galore. this place was okay. The only thing that bugged me and didn't make it wonderful was the fact that they don't have rice paper lol and the drinks are cans and like 1.50 or something so it's not worth buying a drink. also the seats are very crammed against the wall. But the food is alright."}
{"text":"This location beats tofu hut by a mile. I love the service and it's a very clean place. They change the griddle every time it starts to get dark which is great so you won't start creating a lot of smoke. Food is delicious !"}
{"text":"Our group is from San Diego and loves Korean BBQ. We went last night for dinner, and it was the. BEST Korean BBQ we've ever had! Great job Hwaro! The bulgogi was awesome, and the spicy pineapp kalbi."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. Waited for two hours for a large party to be told that once the customer pays they are allowed to sit as long as they want. The time limit says 90 minutes not as long as you want. I had a host tell me after complaining well there's other people who are waiting just as long. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"Great food every single time! Me and my co workers come to eat here late at night twice a week and service is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Place is the bomb! Our server, Harland, was on it and cool as hell and chill! Food is worth the price and more! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a nice and cozy place here! Very nice service and kind staff. I wanna visit here again for sure. Thank you so much, guys!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Quality of the meats are always on point! One of the best Korean Barbecues in Las Vegas!! Open late! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! The best in the west!"}
{"text":"My number 1 kbbq spot in town. A must try is the item called \"The Shit!\", deep fried carb sushi."}
{"text":"Came on a thursday night around 8pm with a group of 10 people. They were able to accomodate us without no problem and our server Jennifer is funny and helpful! Been here a couple times now and still never had a bad service!"}
{"text":"Always great food here and open super late! All you can eat for a great price. My fav is the skirt steak and the salad mix it comes with."}
{"text":"Been here 6 times the past 6 months, had never been disappointed, portions are large, yes they are. Highlights -- the baby octopus is  Fire"}
{"text":"First time here and our waitress is definitely showing us how to KBBQ! Wonderful experience as it is our first time in Vegas too. All the meat is top quality and the service is wonderful and fast. Must try if you haven't had KBBQ before. The menu has a variety and the price is also very affordable for all you can eat!"}
{"text":"A host was really terrible.  I was wating for 40 min. 6 people came in 30min. later than me.  The host served them first.  I asked her that I was waiting for 40min.  She never felt and said sorry for me.  She just said, \"they reserved.\"  If she said kindly, I could not gonna be upset."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price. My favorite is he rib eye steak which is their bulgogi. The pork belly took awhile to cook but well worth the wait. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and restaurant is clean. You also get a free drink if you write a yelp review."}
{"text":"Very busy. Wait was about 40 minutes for two. Manager was courteous. Decor is cute and staff is friendly. Must try \"The Shit\". Our waitress Jenna was friendly and attentive. The food was worth the wait. Comparable to the best coming from LA"}
{"text":"Awesome I was brought here by my friend. Come early because there is a little wait but it's worth it. Price decent too."}
{"text":"Great selection of meats. Affordable price for all you can eat kbbq. Appetizers are great. Lots of veggie options which is always a plus"}
{"text":"I have never been to this place and this is my first time and the service is horrendous! We are a big group and they put us on their list. So we kept waiting and waiting. We were waiting inside almost an hour when all of a sudden the host  told us to go wait outside instead. There were people that got there after us that were waiting also, but for some reason we were the only once singled out to do so. We then asked how long til we get seated and the guy says we can only sit you on separate tables. Are you kidding me? They  pretended that they will accommodate us only to say that they really don't have a table for all of us because the long tables are reserved. Over the phone they said they don't take reservations. The staff were very rude and customer service is terrible. If they would have told us the minute we got there that they cannot accommodate us we would not have stood around for an hour for nothing. We will never go back to this place and I have no intention of trying the food either."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here for first time and we didn't know what to expect. We came to this restaurant because my sister loves eating here and it was her birthday so she chose the spot.  She ordered everything for us and I must say that everything was delicious!  You cook everything yourself at your table on the mini habachi. It is pretty cool. The service was good too. She checked on us alot and made sure we were good. We enjoyed dinner here and will definitely be back again. I highly recommend this place if you are craving for Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends not to long ago and would have to say that I was a bit disappointed had some expectations to have some delicious Korean bbq but the meat seemed cheap. It was a bit too chewy and hard for my liking. Don't get me wrong not all of it was bad but the meat didn't sit well with me as it wasn't easy to eat nor was it pleasant for me. Maybe it was just a bad instance for me so I will be visiting again to reevaluate when possible."}
{"text":"Hot damn it smells good in here the charred smell of a million meats sizzling in their own fat and juices is enough to get your stomach rumbling with anticipation"}
{"text":"This establishment is a kind I would say family friendly place with a good amount of workers I like how you are allowed to cook your own food and unlike other establishments I've been to this they have music in the back round that is very good if your in to let's say different kinds of music"}
{"text":"We saw the mixed reviews but we decided to give them a try. We went there at lunch time, and they had no waitings and server welcomed us. We ordered 6 kinds of meats brisket, short rib, rib eye, enoki beef, flank, and pineapple beef steak and everything was great. There seasoning on the meat was really delicious. I obviously coming back here."}
{"text":"Really affordable for all you can eat. Fresh meat and very clean place. Super cute atmosphere. 19.99 for dinner per person!! Will absolutely be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Long wait but has great food! A must come for all those seeking delicious kbbq! Food is delicious and service is acceptable. The variety is very nice and a whole whopping 55 items to choose from which is a pretty good length for AYCE. The people here are a little ill tolerable because we were seated at 9:50pm (latenight starts at 10) and he refused to charge us for the latenight. The food is acceptable, service could be better.  Edit: told me my review was too short so he did not give me free drink. I love this place"}
{"text":"Best Korean place !!! There's a lot of new AYCE Korean BBQ, but hwaro has always been our go to place. Best selection of meat and appetizers. The staff is also awesome!!"}
{"text":"The spicy bulgogi and whatever. It was alright. Nothing memorable. The service needs to be improved. We had to ask for things twice."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean BBQ place here in Vegas! I love the selection here. The price is super reasonable! $20 all you can eat for lunch and 22.95 for dinner. You must try the shake shake rice. They have other things besides meat. Rice, bulgolgi nachos, ect."}
{"text":"For the first time I had a good experience. Really good food and a lot to choose from. Service was excellent and promptly. The wait was worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome ayce BBQ. Tons of cool appetizers. Kalbi was good and they even have Korean fried chicken. A must go."}
{"text":"I love their Korean barbeque!!! Happy hour starts at 10 and honestly it's the only all you can eat barbecue place I go to in the Las Vegas valley"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is very good. All of the meats we had were great quality."}
{"text":"There are so many choices on the menu to choose from. Everything was delicious. It was the best Korean BBQ in town and the price is reasonable.  We went around 15 minutes after the open time on Saturday and the tables almost filled up already.   I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!! My go to spot when craving for Korean BBQ ... only downside is... the music playing too loud"}
{"text":"The food was awesome,i'm sure that if you come here you guys will not no regret about service,foods and everything when u come to Lasvegas,come and enjoy your meal"}
{"text":"It was really cold probably because it was raining but the food is good. Would be nice if they had more seating for people waiting. It was a little crowded by the door.  The best meat on the menu is the sliced rib eye, avoid appetizers just go straight to the BBQ."}
{"text":"I must admit that the food was good, but the service was super bad. Most of the workers had attitudes which literally just made me lose my appetite. They were so slow and seemed so incomprehensible to whatever we asked to order. It took almost 4-6 times to repeat and \"follow-up\" on our orders, because they'd forget. Bad service."}
{"text":"Well was going to try this place out. Says open till 3 am. I showed up at 2:18 and they say they are closed. Would be nice to know they stop serving Earlier. Gigi to leave this review open till I get a. Chance to try the place. Going down the street to DJK  Update: Actually my third try eating here. Find parking this time and put my name down. Then I waste 45 minutes. When my name comes up the lady says two person minimum and walks off.  Just going to eat at Raku."}
{"text":"Husband and I really enjoyed it. Kalbi and spicy pork were good. Some of the meat were bland. Dipping chili oil sauce was very good. I also enjoyed the steamed egg and fish cake side dish. The wait was long, I almost wanted to leave. Service was not too bad. Would come back again. I would suggest making a reservation. They are very busy all the time."}
{"text":"Harland was great it was my first time and she did great talking me through it I'll definitely come back for sure"}
{"text":"Very busy, but really worth every penny! I have been to this place numerous times, but today's service was outstanding!! Our server Han was really nice and helpful every time we needed something. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Hwaro is an AYCE Korean Bbq restaurant in the same shopping mall as Big Wong and Zen Curry. It's also my new favorite! I like the booth set ups it offers a bit of privacy. The quality of meats have been really good so far ( have not tried everything n menu yet) my favs so far are the chedolbaegi ,bulgogi. Their steamed egg is pretty perfect also. The owner always greets me very warmly and the wait staff has been so sweet and attentive. My one tiny gripe would be they offer no kinds of dessert. Koreans aren't big on desserts but they do love fruits and dessert beverages. I think adding some simple desserts of fruit and sorbets or mochi and drinks like cinnamon punch and sweet rice would be a really good addition. They offer lunch prices and late night for 16.99 and dinner for 19.99. IMHO they are way better and soooo much cleaner than Tofu Hut and less expensive than Sura. Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Hwaro is my favorite all you can eat bbq in Vegas! Prepare yourself to leave smelling like delicious Korean food.  FOOD: Every table is served many Korean side dishes. The fish cake is my absolute favorite. They also give you salad. I like the quality of their meats and how they marinate everything. The brisket and red wine pork belly are my favorites. I highly trying the Shake Shake Rice that comes in a box for you to shake before eating. The cheese corn is a great option if you're a cheese lover like me. My family is a big fan of the spicy bean soup. Oh and the bulgogi nacho is a must try!  DRINK: The Peach Soju is a very popular drink here.  ATMOSPHERE: Expect at least an hour to two hour wait for a table during dinner time. Do not expect good service here. The place is always busy. I like the look of the restaurant and I like to come here with friends and family because it's a fun meal."}
{"text":"Awwwwwesoooome chow and price!! Come here hungry for all you can eat! KKBBQ at its best!! All you can eat!!"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday. The food and service was good however, when we finished our meal there was a $10.99 charge on our bill. I asked and the manager said it was an additional charge because we didn't finish our meat. On top of that they wouldn't let us take it with us. It was all you could eat for $19.99 and we didn't even order extra. But because we didn't finish the initial order we got charged an additional $10.99. What all you can eat business charges extra for not finishing?  On top of that they charge 15% gratuity automatically. So if the service sucks, too bad. You still pay. I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere! I will most definitely come back to this place if I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait was worth it for this AYCE Korean BBQ for $23. One of my top restaurants, and off the strip! Try the \"shit\" which is a special that is off the hook. Favorites included the brisket, short rib, premium steak (1 per person limit), pork belly, and the pineapple marinated steak. The meat was all high quality, everything was Recommend an uber there, parking is the worst thing ever.  If you haven't had Korean BBQ before, the table has a grill in the middle and they bring you the meat to cook yourself! Start off with a big order, so you can eat as you cook. The server will help explain it! Fun experience, awesome food!"}
{"text":"Good quality food and service. Just bring a jacket for the waiting area because it gets packed and it gets cold quick."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and decided to visit.Wow,what can i say!!! It is awesome !!! Service is great and inside is very cozy. food is really  good. will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't too sure about this place but wow I'm surprised it's very good meat and sides! Will come again!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite!! Can't go any other Korean BBQ place. $23 for 54 iTranslate to choose from, what else you can ask for"}
{"text":"Amazing kbbq restaurant. Service is quick and staff friendly. Parking may be crowded but that just means it's popular. Will come back!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite go-to place when I'm hungry late at night. Amazing service and delicious food. Oh! And if you go, you must try \"the shit\"...trust me"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and our server Dan was awesome! He checked on our table frequently and was very attentive to our needs. The menu is awesome for what they offer, theres a lot of different options to choose from. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Love the food and all the different choices on the menu! My friends and I come here all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last night 3/17/18 with a party of 4.  There is a flat fee of $22.95 per person for all-you-can-eat, which you choose from a simple menu.  We paid $1.50 for each can soda and $10.50 for peach Soju.  You can order anything you want as many times as you like for 2 hours max, then they ask you to leave.  The best meat can only be ordered once per table, nonetheless, the portions are very generous, and the quality of the food is ok, but there are much better places in Las Vegas to have K-BBQ.  My 1 star rating is for the following reasons:    1.  Patrons who had just arrived, were allowed to skip the line and be seated ahead of others who like ourselves had been waiting for more than an hour; last time I checked, this is possible when you tip the guy controlling the waiting list....just saying.   2.  Our waitress was insufferable, when she felt we had been there long enough, not even an hour into our dining ,she came by our table every few minutes trying to turn-off our grille;  we clearly told her not to touch the controls but, in one occassion she succeeded, only to have to turn it back on because we still had plenty of meat grilling on the table.  She stood in front of our table looking at her wristwatch, like an angry mother waiting for her teenage kid to come home! Worst service ever! 3.  BE WARE:  15% TIP IS INCLUDED!  But no one tells you.  If you pay with a card, they will give you your transaction receipt, which does not show that the tip is included, on the contrary, it has the usual \"tip\" line.   Only when I asked and insisted in a detailed receipt is that I saw that the tip was included!!! 4.  Parking is very difficult to find, we had to park 1/2 a block away. 5.  The restaurant is extremely small, with practically no place to seat and wait, you must stand outside in the cold, like we did. 6.  Ventilation is none existent, and the smoke from the grilled meats will cling to you and your clothes, be prepared to leave the place smelling like a steak, so make this the last stop of your evening, unless you want every dog in the neighborhood to follow you home!"}
{"text":"Guys I literally visit this place every week. Normally you would have a line if you came for dinner. Great food and great service, especially they updated menu recently."}
{"text":"My sister took me here for dinner. She raved how amazing this place was and from the high review, I had set some expectations. My personal experience, when we got there no one greeted us. When we were showed to our table the host realized he placed us at the wrong place and asked us to get up and move. He did not apologize but laughed about his own mistake.   (Okay some positives:) The meats came out very fast. Fresh and thick cuts. Great seasoning dipping sauce. Simple but delicious side dishes like kimchi, potato salad, fish cake, etc. I appreciated how they changed our pan when it got burnt. . .  However, they forgot our order of corn fondue. This was probably the only thing I was excited to try. But they forgot to bring it to us? We reminded the server this the second time but yet nothing came. Very disappointing.  My sister and I were consistently eating and were interrupted by their 2 hour rule. Totally understand but it's Korean BBQ! It takes time to cook raw meat! I felt like it was rudely advised. She bent over and said, \"You are over your time, I'll bring you desert! What flavor ice cream do you want?!\" I never felt so shocked in a restaurant like this. So we had no option but we were definitely were slowly being kicked out.   When she dropped off our ice cream, my sister and I were just scarfing food trying to finish. While the ice cream just melted beside us.   I kept this to myself for the respect of my sister. I honestly felt like the customer service was lacking. Food and quality is great! What a shame though."}
{"text":"Hwaro is the best Korean BBQ in Vegas! I've been here numerous times and have enjoyed every single time! If you want to have AYCE Korean BBQ, then you have to go to Hwaro!!!"}
{"text":"I am SO SO SO SO happy to have found this place. Coming from Southern California, Korean Barbecue is everywhere.. and usually it's all you can eat at a decent price. I have lived here two years and this is the first place to remind me of home. They offer so much on their menu, it's actually WAY more than I've ever seen.. and all at the all you can eat price!   There are a couple downsides. One being the wait, but it was during the weekend so as long as you are prepared to wait, you'll be okay. And two, the music was so loud! I felt like I was at a club! Other than that, this place is amazing, staff is friendly and I will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Don't say you are open until 3am. We took a cab. Paid money. For them to say that they don't serve until 2am. BS !!!!"}
{"text":"Plus: it's in the same plaza as curry zen- for the best Japanese curry- bold statement I know! And monta ramen- amazing garlic oil ramen!!!!   Parking: it has a private lot but it gets full at peak meal times ! Saturday... we came at 10pm (they close at 3am) and opted for the AYCE bc that's what they're known for. It's a minimum of two people for AYCE FYI. $19.99   The meats we got:   Bulgogi  Brisket Beef belly with jalapeño garlic  Green tea pork belly   My faves: bulgogi and beef belly. BEEF BELLY WAS MY ABSOLUTE FAVE AND WILL BE BACK FOR IT. It melts in your mouth and isn't as thick as the pork belly.  Public health tip: ask for an extra tong for your cooked meats ; and use the one they give you for your raw meats.   Other things we got: shaken rice and bean paste soup (tip cook some of the Brisket and add it to the soup then you got some soon tofu soup / Sundubu-jjigae!) the shake shake rice was good but be prepared bc it's sweeet. I ate it with my meat and of course topped every bite with some kimchi and fish cakes.   Their banchan: are delish! I am picky about my kimchi but theirs tastes fresh and yummmy.  In Vegas- this is the best I've had so far."}
{"text":"Amazing! We got 2 huges plates of skirt steak, pork,beef,steak, chicken, and bulgogi! Everyone is  pretty ful but then we get a vanila ice cream with coffee on top! It would be better with carmel suace on top but ether than that, its phenomenal! If you havent been to a Korean BBQ before, this would be a great place to start!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for all you can eat korean bbq place since we got here at the las vegas. I think this place is better than restaurant in LA."}
{"text":"Great selection or meats and appetizer. Good  tasting and attentive staff !!! 8th time here and counting....."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for dinner since it was my hubby's birthday.  We got here pretty late at night after watching a show over at the Wynn.  Maybe about midnight or something.  I've heard good things about this place from a few of my friends & we finally got to tryin' it out.  First time here & we really had great service.  Our waiter was really really nice (& funny) & gave good suggestions when we asked for it.  He also made sure we always had drinks.  I loooove KBBQ so this place was good for me!!! And who doesn't love AYCE?! Meats were of good quality too.  Unfortunately, off the top of my head, I honestly don't remember exactly the names of what we ordered as our friend who comes here often ordered for us.  I paid much more attention to the soju though. LOL.  I'd have to come here again & I'll give an updated review on the food.  All I can say is it was super yummy (everything we had).  We had no problems.  I'd come back here again for sure though."}
{"text":"Owned by the same people as Sushi Neko across the street (which is one of my current faves right now), this place was a great change in pace for Korean BBQ for me! All-you-can-eat all day special for $20.95; for lunch & late night (11:30am-3:00pm & 10:00pm-3:00am) is only $17.95... they not only offer a large variety of meat and the traditional side dishes, but also offer a bunch of yummy appetizers.   We ordered: - skirt steak - sliced rib eye  - short ribs  - brisket - beef tongue - bulgogi nachos - kfc (korean fried chicken) - the shit (same one offered @ Sushi Neko!) - steamed egg  - steamed white rice  - green tea ice cream  Everything was very satisfactory... the food was delicious, service was great, and we left extremely full! Also probably the nicest Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to as well... loved the decor! We will definitely be back!  PRO TIP: Leave a Yelp review & receive a free drink! :)"}
{"text":"Great casual ambience with a lot of items to choose from. Wait is a tad long but typical for a Saturday."}
{"text":"They lose a star for not filling drinks and not checking back as often as you would like. Food is great and among other KBBQ places it's high quality. We have been there 3 times since we found about it. Much better than GEN Korean BBQ experience. Long wait one out of the 3 times we went about an hour on the weekend at night but a lot of places are like that so I don't normally ding for that"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Korean BBQ spots in town. Quality meat alongside a variety of dishes; all for a reasonable price. My husband and I have been coming here since we started dating so it holds a very special place in my heart. I recommend the skirt steak, brisket, and pork belly! Happy eating"}
{"text":"They're missing a star because their attentiveness to seating people could use a bit more help; otherwise, great place to eat. You get a bang for your buck and the flavors are there. Great for big groups and for the hangries."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to get your all-you-can-eat KBBQ fix. They have a wide selection of meats for a great price that is still delicious."}
{"text":"Its service is really good, and the meat is awesome!  It has many different kinds of sauces that really makes the flavor.  It is one of the beat barbecue i have ever had"}
{"text":"We arrived and had our group listed because there was a waiting line. They were really busy. I wondered why then when we were seated and made our orders for the lunch special at $19.95 per head (all you can eat) and our orders arrived (we ordered only the different cuts of beef), I already found out why. They had a lot of appetizers and you can always ask for a refill. I like the fish cake the best, it is my favorite plus the radish and kimchi! We also have a very accommodating and nice server I forgot her name but she was pleasant. There was also one server who had assisted us her name is Janice. She was equally pleasant and nice.  Aside from the good quality of food they serve, customer service made me give them 4 stars. Could have been 5 stars if the dessert is unlimited or they have additional dessert choices but that is just my opinion. It was a great korean bbq experience at Hwaro. No wonder why people keep coming there. I guess they will be busy from opening till closing. Good food plus good customer service.   I will definitely be back with our visiting relatives and friends. They will surely enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"Never had Korean BBQ but this was an awesome experience there was some fantastic food! It was so much fun cooking my own food. Good choice of meat for the price. It was so awesome! I would definitely go again if I'm in the area. Also the waiter was fantastic! Very friendly!!"}
{"text":"I love the AYCE Korean BBQ here.  They have a lot of different side dishes. Good service and clean location. They have the add day menu which includes beef tongue, short ribs, wine pork belly, tripe, flank and green mussel. I love these squid. Also must try the Korean coffee ice cream. Overall, one of the best AYCE kBbq in town."}
{"text":"They have a good variety of meat to choose from and the portions are a good amount when you order the first. it is pretty good and the servers are pretty sweet. The location is amazing, but the parking is tight so fight for it. The restaurant size is not that big, so it can get crowed really quick. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love hwaro! Very enticing and love the vibe. The staff is always great and you MUST try some of that Shake Rice."}
{"text":"Hwaro All You Can Eat Korean BBQ - go here for their happy hour from 10pm to 3am!! There pricing is really good for the quality and amount of food you get.  I really like this Hwaro for Korean BBQ. The dessert is sooo delicious. Try the Affagato - vanilla ice cream with Korean-style coffee. Soo good, too bad they limit the dessert is only one per person.  Although the parking situation might seem bad, we've always been able to find good parking.   The music choice is sometimes really interesting - heavy metal, Korean music? Very interesting mix.  Don't forget to put your name on the list! It gets really busy, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is very spacious. I also liked how they had booths sectioned off by walls so you and your party have some privacy.   The food is delicious point blank. I highly recommend getting the all you can eat which is $20 a person. You get to continuously order whichever type of meat you would like. Although if you have any leftovers they do however charge you for it.   The one negative aspect was the fact that there water container hardly filled one glass. The waitress did not offer to refill it until it was placed at the end of the table. So make note that if your thirsty, ask for 2-3 water containers to last you."}
{"text":"Hwaro has THE best side dishes ever and the meat is amazingly delicious! Hwaro is def. my favorite kbbq ever!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The food tasted very fresh. I really enjoyed the Sapporro and the appetizers were on point!"}
{"text":"Come here twice a month and love the food every time the late night special is the best"}
{"text":"HOLY COW! We came to eat here one night, but the wait was over an hour long. We returned a couple days later during late lunch, and so glad that we did. My boyfriend used to live in Korea, and this made him reminisce about old times. Delicious food, fast service, and an overall wonderful experience. We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here, right away I feel the energy from the servers. Wide variety of dishes and entertaining servers, a dinner and a show...GUNDAM TIME."}
{"text":"One of the best kbbq places in town. Unfortunately, the pricing has gone up. (but I guess that's expected right?). Which means it has gone from great to good within a few months. Don't get me wrong, I'll still lay the price lol. Anyway. My faves are the spicy chicken (as long as it's cooked perfectly) and the brisket.  The skirt steak and ribeye are also good. \"The shit\" is truly the shit. And the steamed egg!  Can never go wrong with that!  Oh! And the brisket sauce is the bomb! I use it for all meats."}
{"text":"First time to hwaro , super amazing place for Korean BBQ at Las Vegas. The price is super reasonable , and the food are awesome. The coffee ice cream is amazing here. The pork cheek is amazing , the beef tougue is my fav , definitely will come back here again next time when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Read all the great reviews about this place and decided to give it a try, food was ok, but the service was terrible. My friend had to eat while standing because the table they had given us could not fit our party well enough. They did not even try to move us in to a different table (there was a bigger one that could fit our party and we had asked several times but they ended up giving the table to a party of 4, we were a party of 6 + a baby)."}
{"text":"Yummm! All you can eat.  Food is worth it.  The wait is a bit long if you go during Peak times (dinner)  Service is hit and miss.... I've had some awesome servers and some only ok.   It gets a bit stuffy in there with the cooking.  But like I said.... for all you can eat good Korean bbq. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Everything is GREAT from start to finish. Always worth the wait. Staff is extremely nice & prompt."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite, my homies and I really enjoy the food, especially the shit! Great place overall!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Tofu Hut and Mother's Korean Grill for Korean bbq here in Vegas and let me just say, Hwaro definitely beats both of these thus far. Heard about this new place from my cousin and was excited to try it out. My first impression of this place was that it had a more modern and rustic setting compared to any other Korean bbq place I've been too. Plus, the environment was very clean, especially in comparison to Tofu Hut. As for the food, there aren't too many choices but there is definitely a vast amount and variety of appetizers/tapas served with the food - my favorite part about this place. They had not only kimchi and bean sprouts, but also fish cakes, squash, pickled jalapeños and celery, and a ton more. The quality of the food is definitely up there. As for the service, it was overall pretty good. Even though the place got a bit busy and service began slowing down in pace due to this, servers still managed to take care of us and attend to our needs with a smile and positive attitude. Lastly, everything is pretty affordable - the average price you would expect to pay for AYCE Korean BBQ. Overall, great experience. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat Korean BBQ in Vegas. We had a big party(14). Took about 45 mins to get seated, very busy place. I noticed if you go with 4 or less people you get seated a little faster. If you go with a big party I recommend going before 6pm if possible.  Before you get seated  water and the side kimchi are already on the table with the bomb salad. Few things we ordered and were really good.   Bulgogi, kalbi, pork belly, gyoza, brisket, rice paper, steamed egg and the best  meat of the night. prime steak!!! For desert we had this ice cream coffee thing (BOMB)!!!! The service was awesome. Multiple people that worked here came to our table and asked if we are ok. I felt really appreciated. They changed the grill multiple times, I think changing the grill is a must so you can taste all the different meats they have... oh and the food was amazing!!!! This is my new best ayce Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Great service and quality meat.  The garlic butter is a must try let it heat up to a boil on the grill and enjoy the soft buttery garlic  mmm.  Dip your skirt steak in that warm garlic butter so good.  This is my husbands favorite place and I have to admit even though I was not a huge Korean BBQ fan this place has changed my mind for sure.  The wait can be long if you go after 5:30 or 6 but it is worth it.  We go for lunch on the weekends for the most part when we do go.  The price is also cheaper and it gives your body time to process all that meat before bed.  Lol"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, great quality, and was seated quickly. My family liked how there was so many options for a great steal of a price!"}
{"text":"I'm just doing this review for a drink. Place is nice. Food is pretty good. Ayce goes on pretty late compared to the other kbbq places"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after watching a movie with friends. Wanted to check it out since it was new and their icon is the maplestory pig XD (wonder who noticed?). Their prices are ok. $19.99 for AYCE dinner. $16.99 for AYCE lunch. Choice of 4 unmarinated items, 4 marinated items, then 6 more items available for dinner. Not much of a selection   As for side dishes, for us, we got 12 side dishes on top of a steamed egg, a soup, and a cheese corn... and the usual salad.. i was like oOo XD   So for the meats...  Plain - pork belly (usual thick cut pork belly), hwaro pork belly (same pork belly but thinner.. like 1/2 - 1/3 of the usual thickness, brisket (usual), and \"tripe\". Why i put quotation marks on tripe is because from the usual either honeycomb or the one with the layers, .... it was neither.. and was given a long piece of intestine.... wot? thats not even tripe D: no where on the menu says intestine so i guess mis-translation somewhere? Lol (super chewy btw)   Marinate - marinated sliced ribeye (bulgolgi), sweet & spicy pork, boneless marinated chicken, and pork skin. Pork skin was not what i expected. yeah its pork skin but im not too sure how to cook it. it softened up by cooking but it became gelatinous? i couldnt make it crispy cuz the grill made the skin carmelize XD   Dinner - baby octopus, short ribs (not that marinated, which is fine by me), pork shoulder butt, marinate pork ribs, spicy baby back ribs, beef sirloin of flank (what..? isnt sirloin and flank two different cuts/areas) with soy sauce.   The aformentioned green tea smoked pork belly and dessert menu is now covered and not available for AYCE.   not much of a fan of the place. service was a bit lacking on the ordering and water filling. they went to the korean tables like 3x before us once...starting to remind me of another pig restaurant... XD   its nice they renovated this place and made it live again from the old place but WHY YOU NO GIVE ME BEEF TONGUE :( i missed it during this meal.. ."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service!! Charged me double tip, refuse to refund. Never going there again."}
{"text":"my favorite kbbq place ever. very much worth the price and wonderful service. can get busy but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I came here with my hubby almost immediately after landing in Las Vegas and we were starving. It was $20 for AYCE during lunch (a few dollars extra for the all day specials), which is definitely affordable. There are so many meat and appetizer options but we mainly ordered meat. We ordered a total of 6 different types of meat (skirt steak, beef belly, brisket, pork belly, sliced rib eye, and pork cheek). Our favorites were beef belly and rib eye as they were flavorful and juicy. I was not a fan of the pork cheek...it was way too fatty and took forever to cook. Oh and if you write a Yelp review at the table, you can score a free drink. Overall, we left full, satisfied, and glad we found this gem."}
{"text":"Hwaro changed my opinion of all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. The food was fresh, well seasoned and served in a generous amount. Potato salad appetizer was surprisingly good. The waiting time wasn't bad, less then 20 mins. Service was top notch. Our waiter was very attentive, fast and kind. I wasn't a fan of all you can eat BBQ until now. Most places try hard to delay the orders, control the foods as minimal as possible, but it wasn't applied here at Hwaro. Thanks, I will come back"}
{"text":"$17.95 for lunch.  is it worth it?  yes it is.  i didn't go for the upgrade--just ate all the meats on the normal lunch menu. and it was satisfying and great.  service was a bit harried--as lunch rush started, but friendly and nice.  i also enjoyed the affogato dessert.  if i had to change one thing--the potato salad with corn was way too sweet. and the beef belly was just so so--i guess because i was thinking about bacon too much while eating."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean BBQ place in Vegas! Always fresh and delicious. Their stramed egg is my favourite, and I actually eat a good number of their sides. We were frequently checked up on which I found refreshing. Only gripe is they don't have bulgogi."}
{"text":"AYCE KBBQ at its finest!  As a Tofu Hut fanatic, it was refreshing to be spoiled and choose from over 50 items on the menu for $22.95, a few dollars more than Tofu Hut. I really like that they have tons of sides and appetizers to choose from! But the main stars, of course, are the meats. It's a bit overwhelming to look over especially if you're used to choosing from just a couple of items.  My favorite sides and appetizers would have to be the Green Leaf Salad (I am obsessed with the dressing, we ordered 5 bowls of the salad, seriously), Fish Cake (best ones compared to other KBBQ joints), Corn & Potato Salad (creamy, mushy potato salad with corn bits, so good), KFC or Korean Fried Chicken (crispy, yummy goodness). As an alternative to rice, they also offer Rice Paper, which is rare to see here in Vegas (last time I checked).  For meats, we really enjoyed the Green Tea-Smoked Pork Belly, Red Wine Pork Belly, Short Ribs, Brisket, Sliced Ribeye, Skirt Steak. These meats were marinated so well and all were so flavorful. The short ribs were to die for, super tender and sweet. The pork bellies were very tasty also, especially paired with the sesame oil and bean paste combo.  Of course, there are a few cons to this place. I usually LOVE eating bean sprouts as my banchan but Hwaro's version is my least favorite out of all my KBBQ spots. They pair it with green onions and a spicy sauce and honestly, I just want my plain bean sprouts salad. They give you so little of the bean sprouts in a huge bed of green onions in a large bowl. Wuuut? I also didn't like their corn cheese. Just like a few Yelpers here, it was disappointing. There was too much mayo, took forever for the cheese to melt and it comes in a super tiny container. Definitely skip this. Also, the steamed egg was super bland (good thing it's only one order per table, we would have wasted 4 of them if we all ordered one). Lastly, Spicy Pork Bulgogi was so salty and not spicy, it was pretty confusing.   Heads up! 18% gratuity was automatically added to our bill with 4 people. I wasn't aware so the price initially shocked me but they really work for it with fast and friendly service. Our grills were changed quickly and our orders came in accordingly. All in all, I would recommend Hwaro to KBBQ lovers out there."}
{"text":"Hwaro is a Korean BBQ joint that I've been wanting to visit for a really long time. I've heard lots of good things about this place, so the timing could not be any more better. After hearing about a new management takeover, I was excited to try it out.  I later found it that it's the same owners of Sushi Neko and Sakana that now own this resturant. While many may know my feelings about those two places, I had high hopes for this place regardless. I was not disappointed because Hwaro delivered on most accounts.  I like the set-up here. It's a small, but very comfortable restaurant. Space is maximized to its fullest potential, which is always a good thing. I also like the prices here, it's not as expensive as Lee's or Sura, it's very similar to the Gen range.  Onto the food. The banchan was solid, I particularly liked the salad. As far as the meat goes, if given the option, I personally just stick to the kalbi, sometimes I'll get bulgogi as well. The kalbi was good, seasoned correctly, a lil' bit on the thinner side, but I liked it. I also how they leave the bones on, I like to chew on the cartilage and fat around the bones, it's my favorite part. But, I'm just crazy like that. On the one order per person part of the menu, I liked the premium steak, I believe it was a NY strip (it could have been a ribeye) and that was really good.  I like Hwaro, it's better than Tofu Hut (which is grrrrooosssss btw), plus, the pricing is competitive, and there is fair value for what I received. I'm down with Hwaro."}
{"text":"Great food but horrific customer service. We were constantly waiting for someone to come get us more water and we were sitting for 20 minutes before someone finally took our order. Every time we asked for something they would quickly walk away without letting us even finish what we were saying. We waited for everything way too long. Also their menu says they charge a 15% gratuity for over 4 people. OVER 4 people, but even though there was only 4 of us they charged us 15%. I would have paid that if the service was decent, but since it was terrible I fought for it and said that it does not say 4 or more. The associate said they didn't know that the menu said that. I don't understand how some of the associates don't understand the meaning of OVER 4. I'm usually a great tipper. Those who deserve it will definitely receive, but those who don't and are rude will not."}
{"text":"A lot better than Honey Pig in my opinion but still deficient of kbbq in L.A. Their pork belly is on point though."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, and friendly staff.  Its our second time here and we absolutely love the selection of different meats.  We definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Horrible quality of service, cheap dingy meats, do your self a favor go to Jen or Tofu Hut or really any other place."}
{"text":"Floors are super slippery and I felt trapped in a cubicle the whole time, food was dank tho."}
{"text":"What a place to eat and drink and have fun and get drunk.  The good is gret and he service is amazing!!! Highly reccommend it"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for the first time and we had Jayden as our server! He was awesome, pays attention to details and sooo energetic which made the experience even better! Definetely coming back to dine in here. Best korean bbq so far."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! And service is great! I would definitely recommend coming during a weekday as they are less busy, but overall my favorite KBBQ spot in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Been here quite often, love their kbbq and love their brisket sauce. Prices are understandable however service can be a tad bit better, was a few times when I would order a drink and have to ask for it again or have dishes missing. Quality of meat is pretty standard and you do get a large variety of choices for the price. PARKING as always is a pain here and you should expect at least 5 mins or more just searching for an open stall. Please do not park on the sides of the walls or unmarked areas as I have seen cars getting hit that were parked in places they shouldn't have been. Be prepared for an additional wait as there is almost always at least a 30 minute wait time for this place so note that in advance  Overall though place is good and will be here pretty often :D"}
{"text":"What can I say. I could crawl up and live under one of these tables like a Korean BBQ troll, just in hopes of catching a mere morsel of that god damn sliced beef."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and one thing I love is their fast and good customer service! On top of that, the quality of their meat is way above my expectations. I've been to a lot of AYCE KBBQ and this place is definitely my new go to."}
{"text":"My first time here. The place is quite organized. For $20 is a great all you can eat Korean BBQ. But the quality of beef aren't the best. I feel that they need to marinate the beef more. The beef brisket is like a frozen beef and they shaved it hence they can't marinate as it is as thin as a paper but for the price is a good enough all you can eat BBQ. Also you will smell smoke as soon as you get out. Your clothes, bags, hair etc smells like bbq smoke. I had to take shower when I get home as I can't stand the smell. Their exhaust system is not good. They need to do something about that. Overall I had fun because I was with my family other than that the food is mediocre. It's good for a try or with friends."}
{"text":"Checking this place out. Looking great with side dishes. Food smells good from other tables"}
{"text":"The only place that I know of in Vegas that has Rice Paper. The meat is excellent. And despite the name, The Shit taste great. They even have dessert. The Affogato was very good if you like coffee ice cream."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and stopped by for a late lunch.   The place was empty bc it was around 3.  They don't allow parties of 1.  Lame.    Walked next door to Monta  Noodle house for some of the best Ramen ever!"}
{"text":"Good meats, good service.  Some items took a little longer to bring out.  The meats are thick if you like that."}
{"text":"Great place and great service. Worth the long wait. There's a lot of stuff to choose from and lots of different side dishes. Great Korean place to eat for ayce kbbq"}
{"text":"It was very first time at Hwaro. I never knew that it's AYCE. It was really cheap, delicious. Servers were nice"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Late night hours and who could resist great kbbq with soju! Craving satisfied! Definitely coming back and with more friends :) don't forget to fry up your kimchi on the grill for some extra flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have rice paper! Meet is fresh and service is amazing! This is my new spot when it comes to Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try and great environment!!! Food looks delicious!!!! Food smells great from.the.outside... its a lil bit of a wait on a tuesday but its coz its sooo good... come with an empty stomach and relatively well priced...  this will be my go to korean bbq spot!!! :)"}
{"text":"Best kbbq in town. I live all the way in Henderson so it is a far drive but always worth it. Came here for a birthday today and it's great."}
{"text":"Good service and good food they had rice paper unlike a lot of places and good soju and good vibes"}
{"text":"Food: Great selection of meats from beef, pork to chicken, my daughter loved the taste of the meat selections. The sides were a great addition to the meats, although they did  not serve the rice, I had to ask rice to go with the food that we cooked.  Ambiance: Good place for beer, drinks, and of course meats.  Service: Services was good, had to ask the Sesame oil with salt.   Overall: Would definitely come back, eat and enjoy the cooked meats while drinking with friends."}
{"text":"There aren't many KBBQ places I like in Vegas, but Hwaro has made it to my list! Been here twice and never had to wait. The first time, I came with a group of 8, which I would not recommend anyone to come with a big group because they provide only one grill even for a large party. However, I decided to come with my bf the second time and everything worked out just fine.  Typically at KBBQ, we order a ton of briskets and pork belly because most KBBQ places here don't serve short ribs, so when we saw that they do at Hwaro, we ordered some! We also saw that there were certain items that were limited to 1 order per person, and from reading other reviews, we decided to try to pork shoulder butt. Let me tell you, it was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat I have ever tasted! The quality at Hwaro is one of the best in Vegas for an all-you-can-eat KBBQ. If you want top-notch quality, I would not suggest going to any all-you-can-eat places. I personally enjoyed this place and will continue to visit Hwaro again for my KBBQ craving."}
{"text":"Good variety of meat. The chicken bugogi was a lot more appetizing then I thought. I usually don't go for chicken but we ordered it multiple times since it cooked fast. The side dishes were also a nice refreshing taste."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. A lot better value then some of the other all you can eat places.   Their pineapple marinated beef was really tender. Cajun chicken was tasty well. They have a menu item called \"the shit\"... it was aiight.  Now it comes down to service. After the waitress took our first order, the server was able to get our food quickly. As we finished our first round, our grill was pretty caked with the burned marinade. The waitress came by and replaced the grill and took our second round order. This is when it kind of went downhill. Water carafe was removed, but never refilled. 15 minutes go by and we still don't have the second order, so the server comes by and asks if we wanted to order more. I told her we already did, so she goes back and checks on other tables. 5 minutes go by and she comes back and takes the order. We also ask for water along with our order.  She delivers our second round pretty quickly because she knew we were waiting, but then misses the water.   Overall a 4 star because the value and quality weighed higher than the service that we experienced. Almost rated a 3."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice... It's just a small place about 13ish tables.. Food was great so much choices everything tastes good... I like the idea having dessert & appetizer w/the all u can eat... Serving is small portion which is more ideal so you'll make sure you'll finish it... It's a great place... From now on will be going here instead of tofu hut... I only gave 4 star just because they gave us a dirty plates when we were seated which is in guessing it's a mistake...But all in all food was great!"}
{"text":"Nice place and great deal! Nice place to go! Side dish is good. Better for big man because normally you need to pay $35 dollar per person in Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"My cousin and his gf brought me and my bf here to show us that it was better than tofu hut and wow! We're from LA and I believe this is the best kbbq place I've been too. My boyfriend ranked it number 2 after a kbbq literally in Korea so that was a big one! The Shit is reallly the shit!! I also love all the sides and variety of meats!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gen k bbq prior to my visit here. So this review is mainly based around what this place did or do not execute better.   I went here with a party of six, as soon as we step inside the ambiance feels authentic. 5 minutes later we realize, it's pretty crammed inside, and there are only 10 tables with grills installed.   So basically, we were waiting for another big party to leave so that we could be accommodated. This is a pretty big negative seems like a hassle for any big party.   When we were sat, we ordered the steamed egg, brisket, beef bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, pineapple spicy beef and I think that's it?? The portions of food they bring out per tray is GREAT! Unlike gen, they really give you a lot of meat everytime you ask for a refill of brisket, bulgogi actually anything.   In addition, to the heaps of meat they bestowed my table with, the quality of the meat is GREAT. Brisket was on point with a good meat to fat ratio. Bulgogi was just right, not to sweet and not too bland. I suggest everyone order the pineapple beef, it was so tender and flavorful.  Hwaro does not have rice paper sorry folks!   At the end of the dinner they give you complimentary ice cream. Get the plum ice cream. The end!   I suggest this place to parties of 4 or less, anything more you might be waiting a while for a table.  Gen and hwaro are both good, I'll be visiting here more often though, as it is closer to my house.   Quick review  Good quality of meat across the board  They make it rain on meat refills  Plum ice cream Fuego  Not enough seating, big parties beware!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I'm usually not a fan of Korean BBQ, it's just not something I crave. I went here with family and it was delicious!! For an all you can eat menu I'm super impressed with the quality and flavors of the meat here. The customer service wasn't bad but nothing notable. Nobody is really friendly or talkative. The only negative thing is the small space and waiting space. We came during the lunch hour and it was uncomfortably packed with nowhere to sit or stand. The wait times are long and can make you hangry but the food is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"If you're going to get Korean BBQ anywhere do your tummy and taste buds a HUGE favor and try this place. I always go with my friends because this is one of those places where the experience matters most and where the portions are giant! I love it! The waitstaff are very friendly and attentive. The meat is always great (so long as you're dining with people who know what they're doing) and the waiters come around to make sure your grill is clean and replaced throughout you meal. I'm never worried about the wait or the food because the employees here show you they have a sense of true pride in their work, even their uniforms indicate they're available to help you!"}
{"text":"Good food all you can eat , the only thing is the bean paste soup and steamed egg is good for 1 per table only irregardless if there 's 5 person in the table, and its a small bowl."}
{"text":"Nice place and delicious food, and the price is vey fair. Definitely gonna come again!"}
{"text":"Out of all the kbbq placed I've tried back home in LA, this place is the best. The service is really great too."}
{"text":"Been to every KBBQ place available in the Las Vegas area (Doh, Lee, Honey Pig, Hobak, Magal, Sura, Tofu Hut, etc) and also many in the Los Angeles area (Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, Thirsty Cow, Hanjip, etc), Hwaro is just the best in my honest opinion.   (Disclaimer - I am not writing this review for the free soda, since I am home writing this.)  Service: The service provided by the servers are very welcoming and friendly. With that being said, they are always packed in the dinner hours but they work efficiently and very fast. Their speed on food deliver and food prep is amazing. This is awesome because slow service for AYCE meals means being full on much less food since waiting for meat never goes well. They had the water and everything prepared for the table before my party even sat down.   Food:  Ordering was easy and there was a wide selection for AYCE. The meat were all fresh and tender. Comparing to every other KBBQ joint in Vegas, they definitely have the best value for the meat since their quality is the same as any higher valued restaurants. The \"shake-shake rice\" is similar or even better than Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong, which is a feat in its own. The squid is the most tender and easily chewed ever, unlike many other KBBQ places with rubbery squids (ew.)  Price: The damage was minimal to the wallet as two people dinner was 56 after tip.   Final Thoughts: Coming back whenever I am craving meat. Mind-blowing experience, delicious food, fast service, great value. It just can not get better than Hwaro."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing! Spicy pork bulgogi is amazing! Great potatoes, salad, kimchee is great too! All around freat place good atmosphere and open late! Coworkers and i get together a few times a month to meet here! Good prices, good service and easy parking."}
{"text":"Another one of a go to for all you can eat Korean bbq!  The meats are fresh and the service is great. They come back often to check to see if we need anything else - more sides? Yes please! More soju? Yes please! And more salad! I love the side salad too!  Some of the usual is bulgogi, short ribs, bulgogi, short ribs, beef brisket, beef tongue, pork cheek... You get it. It's a meat fest but what the hell do you think we came here for!  Enjoy your dining experience, relax, have some good conversation and wear stretchy pants"}
{"text":"Best value for ayce kbbq in town. Thickest cuts of meat and with tasty seasonings. Also they have interesting menu items aside from the ayce meats. Quick and attentive service. This place gets busy because like I said, it's the best in town, so be prepared to wait or come on the less busy times. If u come a little before the dinner rush, you will be seated promptly. Just a side notes for families w small kids: We have two babies and unlike other restaurants in Chinatown, they have plenty of high chairs but not much space for storage of strollers. Best to carry the babies instead of taking them in strollers."}
{"text":"I will right off the bat say the only con I have to this place is the fact that every time I come, I wait an hour to be seated. Honestly it is such a hassle but the food is always worth it. For the most part at least. An hour is a long time but it's great for a date night or out with friends. That staff is very nice especially when it's super busy and I'm sure they are most stressed, they don't show it too much."}
{"text":"$20 for dinner is a great deal for a korean bbq. My husband and pretty much ordered every single meat on the menu. And we all loved it. They give u a lot of sides and the soup was good also. The fat ass pork belly is really buttery and they also have the green tea pork. They also have a squid in the menu and my husband loved it.  We will defintely keep going back to this place and take all our visitors :) and recommend to all our friends."}
{"text":"Round 2 of Korean BBQ for the night. Really cool staff and great food. Honestly the only down side was the parking. Other than that everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been to several Korean BBQ's in Vegas and many are greasy and dirty. But this one was immaculately clean and the food was delish. Of course, it depends on what you order and how you cook your meats. If you are craving a ton of protein, this is the place to load up. My favorite is the flank steak and I loved all the small side dishes to accent the flavors. I ate and ate until I was about to burst. Definitely go for the lunch buffet, its a bargain. I love this style of dining which gives us plenty of time to spend with friends and family over conversation while cooking the food to desire and immediately consuming it fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Good service.  Great variety of flavors. Lots of side dishes.  Enjoyed it for my first time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for KBBQ. The food is always excellent and the wait is never too long even on busy nights. The servers are friendly and very helpful. The spicy chicken is by far my favorite dish on the menu. The atmosphere is great. They have great comic book art hanging on the wall and great music. The all you can eat price is unbeatable and so is their lunch special. If you are looking for some great Korean bbq without breaking the bank this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"Been here twice and love it. Great food and amazing staff. Definitely my go to spot indefinitely!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite kbbq restaurants!! The customer service is great; the waiters changed the grill very frequently. The meat is so fresh compared to other places, especially the skirt steak and brisket. Overall the place is pretty clean and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Back again after 2 days LOL! And again, still the BEST AYCE korean bbq here in Vegas! Come here with ur stomach empty... now, let me enjoy these sizzling meats in front of me... highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. There was a party of 6 with me and a baby. They put us on a corner table, where it was so small we were literally elbow to elbow. We asked to be moved and the manager kept telling us no. There was a table with a party of 4 and the manager lied and told us that they were 2 different parties but they were all eating off the same grill. So we dealt with it cause we were very hungry. The whole time I was eating I was standing and the manager obviously so that and did not offer to give me a stool or anything. Our server wanted to help but the manager kept rejecting her and us. On top of letting me stand on my table because there was no space. The manager did not offer any discount for the inconvenience and wanted to argue. The food was ok, but the way the manager treated us was so terrible, I really wanted to cuss him out. I will never go to this place again and I will tell all my friends not to go to this place. There are so many other Korean BBQ that has better food and definitely better service who don't let their customers stand!!"}
{"text":"Service is always a hit or miss with KBBQ places, sometimes they feel like helping you, sometimes they don't.  I can't help but keep going back because I actually like the quality of meat here.  Favorite meats are : brisket, beef belly, pork belly and the ribeye!  Favorite sides : kimchi, salad, and bean sprouts.  Not a fan that you only get one steamed egg! Steamed egg is my favorite, you put it with your steamed rice and make a little fried rice with it. If you want you can even add some kimchi with that to make kimchi fried rice. But again, you only get a tiny one-- which is good to split with, at most, two people.  Very well ventilated so unlike the other places you don't feel all the smoke all up in your face!  They change the grill as soon as it starts turning black or burned.  Utensils (tongs, chopsticks and napkins) are already on the table and the serve-your-self water in bottles are set up along with your sides.   It's a tie between the dislikes and likes but I really like this place as far as AYCE KBBQ place goes!  FYI - New management also made new rule that it has to be a party of 2 or more."}
{"text":"Great place to eat late with family"}
{"text":"Free drink with a rating.   Love the price Love the food Love the place  Time to eat!   Recommendations: All you can eat $19.95 specials from 11:30am-4:00pm  Skirt steak Beef belly Brisket  Sliced rib eye Spicy pork bulgogi"}
{"text":"Hwaro is a great kbbq spot to hit up. The price was surprisingly cheap I believe it was right around $17.50 a person and you can choose any 45 items on the menu at no extra charge. If you pay just a hair more you get 51 items to choose from. Did I not mention that it's all you can eat? Perfect for a large group of friends and definitely eat your heart out. Now the only reason why it's getting a 4 star is because of the super long wait and short of rude service.  But I get it it's always busy and the server are on the go go mode. That's okay, I'll still be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and memorable experience. My friends and I were all pleased with the quality of food, service and atmosphere. Only complaint is that it is a little too warm in there, Las Vegas is already hot enough. Overall five stars well deserved."}
{"text":"I visited this place when it first opened. We came in the afternoon and the place was fairly spacious and for the most part, empty. This was actually a welcome change from waiting in crammed spaces for hours. The booths looked clean and the decor modern. The service was very much on point and they were extremely attentive. I guess my main gripe was the quality and lack of flavor in the meats. We sampled practically all of the offerings including the marinated and non marinated options. Everything lacked flavor completely. I actually found their banchan more enjoyable than the meats themselves. I don't think this will become a regular place for our Korean BBQ fix unfortunatley."}
{"text":"love this place! service was great! every time i come here i leave satisfied :) woooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Korean BBQ spots in Las Vegas hands down. It's a regular spot for me when I wanna go eat some great quality meat with some friends. The service is great and there is a huge amount of foods to choose from on the ayce menu. Definitely worth it for the price of only 22.95 for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"I freaking love Korean BBQ, and this place was awesome.   I have to start by saying I came with a large group, because of that I will not comment on the service. I'm not saying the service is bad but I think it may have been super because they wanted us out of there. The restaurant is small and we took up a large chunk.   What I loved: Quality of the meat was great Flavor of the marinated meats like spicy pork was really nice and balanced.  They have garlic butter and little pots of cheese to get hot and melty, see photo.  Price, it's a great value.  I really appreciated unlike other places I've been it's a flat price, you see it you order it. No confusing tiers to flip back and forth though to check if the premium steak tier also includes pork belly...  They were fast and efficient with changing the grill and generous with the water refills.  The best part? When I got home my son hugged me and said \"mom, you smell like meat.\" Ah yes son, I sure do love me some Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean BBQ! Love the pineapple beef! One of the best bean paste soups as well."}
{"text":"Decent kbbq. Menu is big and prices are pretty decent. Not the best quality meat, but theres a lot to choose from and a lot of side options. It always seems super busy here especially for dinner. So busy servers dont really check up on you and you have to flag one down to order more. Nice place for a small group of friends. Wouldnt come back because theres so many other kbbq places to try."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Good foods, good ambience. The \"shit\" and \"shake shake\" rice are the must ordered items. Everything are very good"}
{"text":"Very good Korean BBQ just remember you will smell like BBQ when you come out. It gets crowded but worth the wait. Appetizers and dessert included with the meal. I was upset because they did mix the brisket with beef tongue and I couldn't tell the difference till I ate it."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is good, waitress and busboy lady are very friendly and provide good service. I will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Nice staff ! It was someone's birthday and they had some really cool candles go off for someone !  They were very tentative but I just personally wasn't to fond of the food. My friends loved it !"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Korean BBQ place to go to besides Hobak but hobak can get pricey. Anyway, the food here is always delicious. The squid and baby octopus are so tender! I've tried squid at multiple Korean BBQ places and the quality at other places can't compare since they're usually tough/chewy but not here. The wait can get pretty long but it's worth it in my opinion. The meat is really good as well! I love the beef tongue here. The service varies. Sometimes it's really good and sometimes it's pretty bad so 4 stars for that. The food is good so I'd definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"great place for great food at a great value.  waiters are all very nice.  fast service.  two issues. first, the smoke panel up top.  part of it fell twice while dining and they dont really do anything about it.  secondly is the small lady thats in charge.  either owner or the manager.  rude."}
{"text":"Really good, reasonably priced place for KBBQ in Vegas! So glad this place opened, more options than Tofu Hut and more tables, so the wait isn't too terrible."}
{"text":"Music too loud. Best Korean BBQ in town..me & my wife's Korean BBQ spot,hands down!!just be careful when walking cause their floors are slippery"}
{"text":"First time eating here.  All you can eat for $20 is not a bad deal.  We went after the dinner rush (or so I thought) on a weeknight, but still had to wait a good 30 minutes for a table.  Service was less than average.  The quality of meat was alright.  Serving size of rice could use an upgrade.  What Asian doesn't enjoy their rice?  Serving it in a very, VERY small bowl makes one have to repeatedly ask the wait staff to bring out more.  Could never find the wait staff when I ran low on rice or drinks.  However, can't beat the price.  I may come back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. The food was great, very affordable, and the service was AMAZING.   Galbi, tripe, and octopus were my favorite. I wish San Francisco had KBBQ as good as this, but maybe for the sake of my waistline, this is a good thing.   I also loved that our server had the banchan coming non-stop. Overall, this place was fantastic and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"AYCE kbbq :)  Decent spacing inside so wait times aren't too bad (if there is). For the cost & the quality of the food, you definitely get what you pay for. I'd say the lunch special is the best deal. You cook your own meat here. Good variety of meats and appetizers if it's a first visit. If you love sweet anything, go for the bulgogi nachos! And maybe some soju. My favorite was the jalapeño garlic pork belly   The service was great, always replacing the grill.  Parking in this plaza, we all know is a pain, so good luck. If the wait time for another place is ridiculous, might come back here to try other things."}
{"text":"There's just something fun and primal about grilling your own meat.  Amuse bouche forget it.  Watch the slabs of marbled beef hissing atop the grill.  Your mouth will begin to water.  Even if this is not happening at your table.  You merely just peak in and walk through the door as you see all the tables full.  Then, wait in line for this tantalizing experience, the aroma alone will wet your appetite.  In addition to that, Korean barbecue's natural pairing to beer-and-soju makes it hard to beat.   Its easy to see why this has become the well deserved meal you crave when your ravenously hungry.  When Korean BBQ is top of mind, the locals head straight to Koreatown to the-ever-so-popular Hwaro, a restaurant packed with devotees of Korean-style BBQ.     It's casual, street-style ambiance and parade of tasty meats, allows  Hwaro to continue to deliver one of the most visited KBBQ experiences off the strip.  Affordable at $22.95 per person, this all you-can-eat Korean dining chow down is the place to visit. The banchan or small side dishes/accompaniments, and appetizers (selected by you) served at the beginning of the meal sets the tone while the namesake \"spicy beef\" short ribs is the go-to order.  Pineapple juice sweetens and tenderizes beef short ribs in this classic Korean grilled dish.  The tantalizing smell of sizzling spicy pork is the next best thing!  It will surely tempt you to keep the orders coming.    Their meat cutter can cut meat so thinly you can read a magazine through it and the bone-in short ribs are cut masterfully crosswise to keep up with the never-ending demand.    This is a small but, comfortable, spot, where meals are grilled tableside. Indulge in it all, because you choose from the menu what your craving, and until content.  The menu has an array of choices and various cuts ranging from soft and succulent pork belly to thin bacon cuts cooked to a soft chewiness or satisfying crunch. When you do your own cooking, it's all up to you!  The \"shake shake\" a  signature dish  arrives in a tin that was meant to be covered and shaken to mix.  The base ingredient is thick, spicy-sweet paste - a combination of doenjang (fermented bean paste) and gochujang (Korean red pepper paste).  Normally this paste would be used primarily to glaze barbecued meats or as a condiment for lettuce wraps, it can also be a dip for cold vegetables like carrots, cucumber, or peppers.   These meats are mouthwatering deliciousness.  Paired with the vegetable side dishes, beer & other fun beverages, it's hard to beat the fun you can have with the right group of friends or family! It is always best enjoyed in groups.  Korean recipes are often accompanied by kimchi, a spicy fermented vegetable dish mostly consisting of cucumbers, cabbage and other root vegetables marinated in a spicy chili seasoning.    KBBQ is a unique experience where cooking and eating take center stage.  The meat being the star of the show!    Jal meokgesseumnida"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for KBBQ so when a family member suggested this place to me on my last night in town, you know I had to try it. First off, the parking is impossible...it's tiny and no one leaves. So I had my bf drop me off so I could put our names down while he found parking. He circled the lot about 10 times before he gave up and went to find parking in a nearby lot.   The wait was about 30-45 min for 3 people but we did go at a busy time (6:30-7). The indoor area was tiny so we had to wait outside, and it was freezing! We were finally seated at a table closest to the door and we couldn't wait to dig in. At first it was a little awkward cause we were so close to the door and the people waiting were literally staring/watching me eat.   The menu had the most variety I've ever seen for an AYCE, they had specialty items (which do have caps on how many can be ordered), meats, soups & sauces. The $hit is a must try! I enjoyed the bulgolgi nachos which were basic but delicious. & the premium steak was the perfect amount of fat to meat ratio.   I wish I didn't come here cause now I can't get anything close to as good as this was. I will make it a point to eat here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food is so much better now since they changed ownership. I have tried other ayce KBBQ here in Vegas and this one is now my new go-to for ayce. Even though it's a bit more expensive (20.95$) compared to Tofu Hut , they have more variety with appetizers and more meat selection. I always get the usual short ribs and beef tongue. The enoki beef is good but there's a 1-order/person limit. I really enjoyed their banchan and salad too. Dessert is also included in their ayce. I got their affogato (vanilla ice cream with coffee) which is my fav. Our waiter (forgot his name but one of the Korean guys w/ the glasses) was super nice and attentive despite how busy it was at night. If you get the older lady as your server though though .. service is not that great."}
{"text":"I was very excited upon hearing about this new korean BBQ place, because it had hang jung sal (pork butt shoulder? Im not sure lol) and they give you steamed egg as many times as you want. Other places give you steamed egg once and that's it! The bean paste soup was decent as well, too salty in my opinion. So this place closes at THREE am and the boyfriend and I had gone around 7 pm after work to get a bite to eat. The hang jung sal I was so excited to get was on the special list where every person can only get one order? I was already disappointed at that then they tell me they ran out already?!?! It wasn't even busy and how could they be out of the special at 7 pm if they close at 3am, way to plan ahead -_- So after all this, I decided to just eat the other things on the list since I had no choice. I noticed they had green tea pork belly and they also had another flavor but I forgot what it was called...it was wine flavored!! When we got these, I laughed because it literally looked like they sprinkled some flavor on it just to show they put something on it. When it was all cooked, it didnt taste like anything, it just tasted like the normal pork belly without flavor. Also, midway through our meal, we noticed that everyone had the lettuce you eat with the BBQ. We didn't know about it because our server never told us about it and didn't even bother to let us know later. When we asked, he just said \"oh, I forgot\". Since were on the topic of the server, I had to ask him THRICE for things. I asked for garlic and sliced onions so I could grill them to eat it with the meat. He forgot so many times that when we actually got it, we didnt even cook it since we were so full. He also did this with the soda. Thank goodness they have water on the table you can pour by yourself or we would have been so thirsty. I didn't get it because it was not busy at all. The side dishes are okay and I just did not enjoy anything about this place. Gave it two stars instead of one because the decor was cute."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a must come! Lines are always long so I recommend planning ahead.. but once seated you won't regret the late night specials!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! My husband isn't usually adventurous when it comes to food (I blame the red gene) but he took me here for lunch. We ordered the brisket, some skirt steak, chicken, and a few appitizers. I'm not much of a beef person, but the brisket was amazing! We ordered a second helping of it. They give you a lot of meat. The only thing I wish they had was veggies. Service was great! Place was clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!  Very child friendly!  Assortments of selections including brisket tongue and belly!"}
{"text":"Really love coming here. Everyone is always so friendly. The pork belly is my favorite!!! Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I ever experience here in Las Vegas . Never eat at this place. Manager was rude & just straight asshole. A food truck service will give you better customer service"}
{"text":"They don't have liquor license so the waiter recommend us to buy it from 7-11 that was a 10 minute walk. Okay, that's fine. We did exactly that. 2 hours later, 2 servers came over to tell us that we are not supposed to bring alcohol inside because they will not be able to receive their liquor license...I explained to them that brought the alcohol under their instructions but unfortunately they didn't seem to pay much attention to what the guest had to say.  On top of that, I had to constantly ask them to clear our emptied plates, and WHY DO YOU LET PPL COOK PORK/MEAT/INTESTINE ALL IN THE SAME BBQ PLATE?!! YOU WANT PEOPLE TO GET SICK? At switch the tray in a timely manner for chrissake.  I gave them 2 stars cuz i pitied the servers for lack of training and they lucky I didn't get sick from cooking meat and pork at the same time.  These guys need to learn how kbbq works in LA.."}
{"text":"Typical Korean BBQ with fresh meat. Got seated fairly quickly for a group of 7. Good service!"}
{"text":"best kbbq in Las Vegas. Has everything. Next to a boba place too. This place is perfect."}
{"text":"People were heading inside minutes before they opened to put their names on the list. Could be a typical Saturday or maybe it was graduation weekend.  I certainly see why the crowd. The service was exceptional, friendly n considerate, plus they were diligent w changing the grill. Very important. Good quality meats n banchan. Cooked items like KFC was crispy good; The Shit was just okay, fishy n not that interesting.   I liked that they portioned the orders smaller so we could try more without getting too full. TIP: order thin meats like beef brisket and tongue first so you could get to eating fast.  We had such a wonderful time. Left w happy bellies."}
{"text":"This is my favorite kbbq place! It is a great place for friend gatherings while enjoying the delicious food. 100% recommended!!"}
{"text":"The long menu for the price is A+!!!! Theres even some corn cheese on there for the kids. Just be wary of the time though because since they're so busy and popular they will tell you when it's your last time to put in an order. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait if you're coming on a weekend but they have tables where you can wait and the food and service is great! $20 AYCE, green tea ice cream is great."}
{"text":"Great price for the ALL Day Menu even if its the late night happy hour! The short ribs are the reason to get the all day menu! Above average service! Theres no wait time if you come on a week night after dinner hours."}
{"text":"I can eat brisket all day. I'm writing thru my gfs Yelp account lol because our awesome server gave thumbs up for free sapporos for 2. Cheers y'all. Hwaro you rock!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the 30-45 minute wait.  The staff was friendly and fast.  The food was fresh and you get to cook it to your liking.  I was surprised about cooking our own food, which made it an eventful meal.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love Hwaro so much. My favorite dish was the skirt steak (beef), but last time I went there they served pork as the skirt steak. When I asked our server if it was pork, he lied and said it was steak. This is the second occurrence of this happening. I will no longer be dining at Hwaro :("}
{"text":"Went here last night and I was very impressed. I enjoyed the interior design, friendly staff and delicious Korean bbq! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Get there early, by 6 the line was out the door and down the sidewalk."}
{"text":"I love this place!! 5 star!! Customer service is awesome and the food is great! Wish I can say more but this place never disappoints me. Get the baby octopus because it's really good."}
{"text":"Hwaro... What can I say? It's a $20 AYCE Korean BBQ place.   $20 you say....I say YUP...$20!!! :)  So at this price of you are expecting the high end quality cuts of beef...Uumm..... What you been smoking??? Cuz you should really share! Lol j/k!!! :D  But saying all that, the quality of the beef is not bad... It's actually decent. All the meat that I have tried were good. Tender... Not tough... And flavorful. Try the different marinated ones...like the red wine pork belly... I loved the different dipping sauces but I gotta say that the sesame oil with the salt is always my go-to sauce. Just start getting you meat and get your meat on!!  The side dishes were delicious!! Don't forget to ask for the garlic and the jalapenos...I love to eat them raw but you can grill them for extra flavor. Also get the shake shake rice... Just a tip... If you have leftover side dishes... Add them to the box before shaking and enjoy!! It's kind of like a fun bibimbop...Lol my favorites were the salad and the steamed egg... Steamed egg... So yummy!!!   It always has a long wait... So be prepared to wait... But I normally put my name on the list and go-to kung fu tea to get a tea... So that I have something to do.   And be prepared to leave stinking like the yummy Korean meats that are grilled there... But hey... It's a price that I'll pay anytime...$20 for AYCE... Yup I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat KBBQ! many options of beef and side dishes. banchan is on point as well are their soju options. great atmosphere espof chalky if you like KPOP as they have it on the tv. So popular that the wait is usually an average of 15-20 sometimes a little longer than most restaurants of the same but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating Korean bbq here! I would definitely come back to this restaurant when I visit Las Vegas in the next time. And Jayden was a great server!!"}
{"text":"Place is a great place to catch up with friends, the waiters and waitresses are also very responsive. The food also tastes amazing super simple to cook."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It is suited for large groups and I love that. I really like coming to this place with my friends. It is so good!"}
{"text":"This is the best kbbq in Las Vegas! So much to choose from. All the meats are very fresh. The staff comes to check on our table often. The food taste delicious. The desserts are very yummy also. The chicken bulgogi and skirt steak are a must!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great fun environment! Sometimes the wait is long but so WORTH IT! It's great to go out with friends."}
{"text":"First time here and def coming back! We arrived during near peak hours (7pm) and only waited about 20ish min. The 4 of us tried prime pork rib, skirt steak, sliced ribeye, premium steak, and short ribs. All were tender & flavorful. Even the side dishes were delish.  Staff was friendly and very efficient despite the ongoing line outside & in the waiting area. The pricing ($23 per person all u can eat for dinner) is the best value I've seen for this degree of quality & flavor for this type of food. And the price includes dessert! Def coming back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places period! This the place if you need a Korean BBQ fix. Go with the brisket, the bulgogi nachos are excellent as well. Staff very friendly, great see Action for all you can eat, always crowded but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite ayce kbbq in Vegas.  More selections of meats than nearby BBQ spots, also prices here are much more reasonable compared to other places especially with the options they do give you.   Servers are always helpful and willing to guide you and assist you through the menu.  Service isn't always up to par depending on the time of day you are dining in.  Again, this is Asian dining in friggin Chinatown and not a Michelin restaurant; you guys complaining about service and cleanliness has got to get a grip and take your pretension else where.  Eat the damn food and enjoy.   Getting a table after 5 pm, good luck.  Always a wait for the minimal seating, so choose your time in meeting friends and family wisely. After 10pm is always great and so are lunch hours."}
{"text":"Great food! Great price!...good service! I will keep coming back here whenever my cravings for the AYCE KBBQ demand for it!"}
{"text":"The wait is a little long but worth it! Good food and awesome kpop music. Give a review and free soda :)"}
{"text":"if your looking for a fun meal korean bbq where u cook ur own meat in front of you is busy entertaining and fun. my entire family enjoyed it and the food was definitely in the faves list. love this place."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this Korean BBQ spot back when the lunch special used to cost 14.95. Despite the raise in price I will continue to visit this spot. The quality of meat you get here is seriously the best in town for AYCE. They give you your own bottle of brisket sauce which is extremely helpful so you don't have to keep flagging down your waitress for refills. It can get really hot in here and I feel like the floors and tables are perpetually sticky because of all the oil and grease that comes with KBBQ. For me, the absolute must haves are their brisket as well as their JALAPEÑO GARLIC BEEF BELLY! They also offer you a choice of an affogato or scoop of ice cream to top it all off.   The only time I can ever come here is right when they open because often times I do find that the wait time is ridiculously long for someone with a toddler. While I do think the food is worth the wait, it's just not worth the toddler tantrums."}
{"text":"Great food and selection. Best Korean BBQ I've had in town! Service is on point. We had this last night and this will make round two tonight. Shake shake rice is must have."}
{"text":"I been many ayce korean bbq places around the country and this place the i like most. Kitchen very clean and servers r very fast and knowledgeable about menu. All the beefs and porks r pretty fresh and have a good tasty flavor. Banchans r oki but i seen better ones in other places. Egg souffle/salad and ice cream comes with the ayce so thats pretty good. Over all its pretty good and definitely go back soon ^.^"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm not really a fan of Korean BBQ to begin with, but the hubby likes it so we have Hwaro a try. Don't get me wrong, I love Korean food, but I just feel like if I wanted to cook my own food, I'd stay at home and cook. But I digress, lol...  The pros - service was great. We made a reservation and the table was set up with ban chan as soon as we arrived. The food came quickly and servers stopped at our table frequently to see how our food was, if we needed anything, etc. I enjoy the ban chan almost as much as the main course and the ban chan here was really good. I also liked that the meal came with steamed egg and tofu soup.  The cons - I was expecting the meats to be more flavorful. The kim chee tasted like it was made a month ago (full of spice and flavor) but the meats (chicken, kalbi) tasted like it wasn't marinated long enough or with enough marinade. The sweet and spicy pork also tasted like it was missing something. Here more than anywhere, the meat is supposed to be the highlight of the meal, but for us, it wasn't.  All in all, the experience was good, but the food fell slightly short."}
{"text":"Really? What is with all these hypes? I do not get it. I've been here last week and had a bad diahhrea, possible FOOD POISONING, after eating their meats. I had the brisket, pork belly and bulgogi. I could not sleep the same night from going back and fourth to the bathroom all throughout the night.   Man, I don't know what kind of meat they use; I can definately tell they are NOT using the fresh ones. I, as Korean, am a pro when it comes to Korean food including KBBQ. It was my like third time and was never a fan. I also got distracted by loud atmosphere and servers sometimes forget our orders as well. I regret wasting my times on fining a parking spot, waiting in line for 2 hours. Will not definately go back and will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and every single time something about the service annoyed me.   The place is nicely decorated, pretty clean, rather small for their popularity. There is usually always a wait if you go during lunch time or dinner time.   It is definitely one of the cheapest AYCE Korean BBQ place, a good selection of side dishes and a goof variety of meat, however, the service is pretty terrible.   The first time I was there I was celebrating a friend's birthday, toward the end while we were eating our ice cream we were asked by our waitress to leave because they have people waiting for tables... really? Honestly, it is not like we were sitting there for a long while, I literally just put my spoon down and the waitress ran over and asked us to leave. I get it, the place is small and they have very few tables, but I don't think guests should ever be asked to leave before they are ready.   The second time I came with my family, there were 6 of us. As we were ordering the meats, we probably ordered 5 different meats, the server looked at us and asked \"Can you finish all this?!\" - I understand that they are trying not to waste products, but for 6 people ordering 5 meats... and we eat A LOT...he could have asked in a more polite manner. And the entire time we had to flag down our server for more side dishes, he kept going to other tables except for ours.   The third time I was there, there were 3 of us. We ate everything and everything was fine until we wanted to pay. We had 1 plate of steak with 2 slices left over, the owner walked over, eyed our table and said \"Next time I will charge!\" - we simply said Ok but we honestly did not like the way the meat was marinated so we did not eat it. We literally ate everything on the table except for that meat and she gave us attitude.   I really like the price and the food, but after being there 3 times and getting annoyed all 3 times, I will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"Hwaro definitely gives Gen a run for their money. If you're a Gen fan (like myself), then you're going to LOVE Hwaro. Same concept, but the meat is exceptional. We tried the beef brisket, bulgogi and premium cut steak (rib eye). We must have ordered at least 4 rounds of the brisket. Something 'bout thin cut, slices of meat with a flavorful lean half and fatty juicy other half. I loved the brisket!   They have a special \"house sauce\" that is perfect with every piece of meat. Be sure to also order the brittle and garlic sauce. This sauce is life-changing!  I can't wait for my next visit to Hwaro! This is the BEST Korean barbecue in Vegas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly kind and polite.  The wait time to be seated was very upsetting and there isn't much room to sit while waiting.  The restaurant as a whole looks very clean, but the tile floors under the tables located on the far side of the restaurant were unacceptably sticky.  The major problem with this place is that it seems to be 1-2 servers short of what it needs to be.  Each of the servers we encountered had a surprisingly pleasant attitude despite clearly being overworked.  The ribeye and chicken breast were very good.  We appreciate how they changed out our cook plate three different times with each new round of meat brought to the table.  The mashed potato salad, the pickled onions, the pickled daikon radish, and the salad were all very good.  The sign outside the restaurant says \"BBQ and Tofu\".  We did not see tofu anywhere on the menu.  The prices were fair.  The meat was very tender and delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out after one his co workers recommended this place. First of all, I lived the atmosphere except for the music, just a tad bit too loud. The service was good, would've been better if the waiter came around more considering it was an all you can eat place. When you order (almost anything on the menu) they bring very small portions to put on the grill. Yes it's a Korean BBQ joint. Considering they do that, either they need to come around more or bring bigger portions"}
{"text":"I used to go to tofu hot, and this is the first I have been here. Their price is a little higher than tofu hot, but it is reasonable. They have lots of items list on the menu, and everything is very fresh. Great food and great customer service. Definitely gonna come back. Love this place."}
{"text":"If you compare almost any kbbq place to LA's variety... you can give them 3.5-4 stars. For a kbbq spot in Vegas terms.. this is actually really good! Hwaro is a busy location like any other ayce place, but in my opinion it offers the best variety! I've only been here once which was couple days ago, but safe to say I will be back again. It is located on spring mt which is its only downside due to horrible drivers and lack of parking, but once you get beyond that it's not bad. Expect a wait from atleast 10-20 min on a normal day. My girlfriend and I went on a Thursday afternoon and it was only 10 minutes. The servers were pretty busy, so we did not get the most amazing service. That was not a problem because they are only human and have to cater to other customers as well. When the servers were with us I can tell they did their best to accommodate our needs and get us what we wanted in a timely manner. When I go to kbbq I usually get the briskets, pork belly, and for this location the skirt steak. The meats were decent quality and definitely better than tofu hut or doh. They actually have a way bigger variety including side dishes such as \"the shit.\" Try \"the shit\" it is very good. They do a good job on changing your grill. The ayce price was $18.99 (correct me if I'm wrong). I will definitely be back to try their other options!"}
{"text":"This place is Ayce and the price can not be beat! Parking can be a pain. And to get a table can be a LONG wait. My family came for a Christmas celebration and we called to rsvp. My one complaint is that it was way too loud. I had to yell at my husband sitting next to me about everything, and it was near impossible to talk to the person in front of you. My party was large and we had 10 people. They waiters seemed overwhelmed and my family just cooked, it's OK though, we're Korean. The sides were really good. The meat was good, not the highest highest quality but $20 ayce? You just can't beat it. Be prepared to order quick, and do not over order as they will charge you!"}
{"text":"Great place for having Korean bbq.   I love this restaurant.   Probably the best place pineapple flavored steak and side dishes in the city.  I think it's a good idea you try it for yourself and let us know what you think."}
{"text":"Really good meat quality here, and the service is fast than most of other Korean restaurant. Price is only $22.95 which is good. And you can get a free drink if you post this in yelp:)"}
{"text":"Wanted to Take my Mom to a Korean BBQ AYCE and found this place on yelp.  The Food was good and so was the service.  For the AYCE Lunch without the All Day Special is $17.95 and with the All day Special which includes Kalbi it's $20.95,  the Parking was a nightmare. so I parked on the Street."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Highly recommend if you are looking for a place that stays open late"}
{"text":"Out off all the kbbq in town this is the one I come here the most. They have a huge selection at a reasonable price. Just don't bring this guy hanz ambas because he will eat all your foodp"}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment. The bugulgi was excessively tough and cut too thick. We tried a few other cuts of meat and they were all chewy. The marinade was too salty. The side dishes were very sparse in selection and was all the cheap stuff. They also didn't turn on our exhaust fan over the barbecue and I had to ask them twice to turn it on . The service was also terrible and when we complained about the meat quality they insisted I didn't know what I was talking about even i explained how often I go to Korean barbecue restaurants all over Vegas, New York and LA.   Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I Honestly love love this place. Now that Tofu Hut has a forever line, hwaro does a wonderful job of fulfilling my kbbq cravings! love that you feel like you're actually in a place in korea (not credible bc i've never been to korea) but if i were to think of how a korean restaurant would feel and look like in Korea it'd be like this LOL Foods great although i am not a kbbq snob im pretty easy to please when it comes to the concept of kbbq. So if you're a hardcore kbbq critic my review may not be useful when it comes down to the meaty gritty.  Give me meat bean paste and a great salad and you've got my vote! lol prices are budget friendly too. Please try the Coffee ice cream dessert they have at the end too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean BBQ spot! The portions are huge and the meat quality and flavor are fantastic! One thing I would change is that on their menu, they have an all day special that states \"one per person\", I would change it to, \"one order per table\" as they give you a whole table's worth of the order. But other than that, great and fast service, and excellent food! Will be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing place... Staff very friendly,food seems good and fresh every time they served.I strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Very great selection!! Staff are efficient and quick!! Opens late! Good food! Cheaper than others and quick staff! Good meat selection ."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  4/1/16: Went back last Friday and had a friend with me so I could \"qualify\" to sit at the Grill and do AYCE.  Noticed on the front door that they put up a sign saying that Grill and AYCE is for 2 or more persons, and even offering an apology if you don't meet this requirement.  To be fair, I've come across another Korean BBQ place that holds the same policy.  Once seated I noticed that they changed the grills from the rectangular ones that survived through 3 previous ownership changes, to the 14\" rounded types with holes on the outer perimeter.  I also noticed that they reduced the number of grill stations as well, so I can understand now why they are limiting the grills to parties of two or more.  Ordered the Bulgogi (it's labeled as \"ribeye\" on the menu) and the Kalbi Ribs.  I prefer LA Style Kalbi, but this place has the traditional cut.  I've posted pictures before of their beautiful presentation, but now it's just thrown in a metal bowl and served to you.  We actually ordered 2 bowls of Bulgogi because the portions are modest, which is okay since it'll prevent waste.  The Bulgogi was marinated nicely, but the Kalbi ribs were a bit too thick, and the meat a bit rubbery.  I ordered the brisket and it came nice a thin shaved.  I like Bibim Bap sauce on my brisket so they were nice enough to bring me some on the side.  My friend likes salt & pepper on his rice (don't ask, I didn't) and they actually brought a bowl of salt/pepper mix from the kitchen for him.  My friend wanted chicken, so we ordered the Dak Gui.  It was a disappointment, just two breasts that were butterfly cut, and no marinade, so I used the sesame oil and pepper sauce that was given on the side to try and infuse some flavor.  They also didn't provide any garlic as well.  Good thing I had the Bibim Bap sauce to give the chicken some kick.  I'm upgrading from the previous 2-star rating, but not returning the original 4-star rating.  The food has gone downhill.  There was no soup or egg souffle like last time, the bancha was limited (no cucumbers or anchiovis) and the Kalbi and Dak Gui were disappointments.  Also, the floors continue to be a problem, as they remain slippery like someone waxed the floors with a layer of Crisco, which makes rubber soled shoes as slippery as teflon.  The pricing is still great at $20 for AYCE dinner, so that'll keep bringing people in, but there are definitely better joints out there as far as quality goes.  UPDATE:  1/22/16:   Unfortunately Hwaro's ego has gotten too big for its own good.  Stepped in yesterday for a late lunch, and despite seeing 4 open grills, was told that I couldn't get a grill as they are for parties of 2 or more only.  Ok, so I asked if AYCE is still available at a non-grill station, and was told no.  Wow, took my business elsewhere (Trattoria Nakamura-Ya which was a far better choice) and will continue to do so until this place sees its 4th owner, which shouldn't be too long.  Once gave this place 4 Stars, but taking it down two notches since I received no service at all.  FIRST REVIEW:  5/19/15: Been eating Korean BBQ at this locale for over 8 years and 3 previous owners.  Just walking in and seeing the new decor gave this place some much needed style, decor, ambiance and personality.  The wait staff was very friendly, and the food came fresh to the table, prepared and presented excellenty from their owner/chef who was the Head Chef at the Shila(sp) Hotel in Korea.  Nestled in the Seoul Plaza, which is quickly becoming Tokyo Plaza with nearby big-hitters like Raku, Raku Sweets, Monta Ramen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya and Kabuto Edomae Sushi residing with them, it's nice to know that there's an actual Korean joint that can hold it's own weight in this plaza of Yelp Celebrities.  Add this to the list of places I'll send my friends to.  If this inspires you at all to check out Hwaro, please tell Nali (which others also pronounce as Nari and Naughty) I said hello as she doesn't believe me when I told/promised her I would give them props on Yelp!"}
{"text":"i come here frequently with friends~ it's a lovely place to eat, everything is super good, the servers are super nice, too. i think our server last time was jirro? i think that was his name? either way he was really funny and cool and recognized me and my brother from the last time we had gone. everything is lovely about this place, from the fact that it's the best KBBQ in vegas, you guys have excellent customer service, to the fact that last time i was there, they played nothing but red velvet."}
{"text":"Good price and good food. The place is a bit tight and the wait time can be crazy sometimes but over all my family loves it"}
{"text":"Quick and efficient service! I'm vegetarian so it kind is a bummer that they don't have more options to grill veggies or something on the side but my friends all love it! Less stars because of the fewer options for me though."}
{"text":"We got here right when it opened so there wasn't a wait. We got the lunch all you can eat special for $17.95.  You get to order sides, appetizers, and meat from the menu.  There are a lot of choices and everything we got tasted good.  Definitely worth the money since we would have probably paid double or triple the amount at a restaurant that wasn't all you can eat. Only negative thing was that some of our items came out really late so we weren't as hungry anymore."}
{"text":"Wonderful quaint hole in the wall, much larger than expected, vibes here are pristine"}
{"text":"17.95 lunch and late night worth!!! Bulgogi nachos are lit!rice, lit, salad lit, water lit"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of KBBQ and always so good. :) Definitely recommend. They have the usual, bulgogi, brisket, pork belly, chicken, and so much more lol. I swear I find new stuff everytime I come here. Try 'the shit' for the appetizer, and the affogato for dessert. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the cheapest All You Can Eat KBBQ places I've seen in town for a long time. At $20 for AYCE, it's a hard price to beat. The restaurant is pretty clean with a sort of vintage look about it. The restaurant does get very (and I mean VERY crowded on most days), so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PLACING A RESERVATION BEFORE YOU GO.   You'll find the hardworking, but friendly servers running around from table to table. The choices of meat are extensive as they are high quality. The side dishes are very good, and there is a large variety.   All in all, great food, great service, but definitely make a reservation to eat here, or you'll be stuck waiting 30+ for a table."}
{"text":"We are from LA not far from K Town. Been to many LA KBBQ restaurants... kbbq fanatics:  Great location. Spring valley not far from the strip Great price even for $19.95 or 16.95 All you can eat Absolutely amazing quality of meat!! Awesome hours from 1130 to 3am! Meat variety is awesome!!! Rapid very pleasant service  I cant find any cons for this place  Server David was faster than Batman and more pleasant than James Bond. Thank you!  Anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars is probably an angry vegetarian activist!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time this place has great vibes and awesome service! This is my Favorite all-you-can-eat barbecue, delicious food, good price, and the customer service is the best that there is compared to any other place I have been! I recommend this to any friends and family looking for amazing food! I give this place 5 stars and two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The first batch of the brisket was super good. They didn't have a lot of different marinade variety but instead a lot of different meat choices which is better.  Most options were good but avoid beef belly.  No rice paper but overall a great kbbq"}
{"text":"Great ayce! Good for late night Korean BBQ cravings! Pork cheek was tender and banchan was on point"}
{"text":"The quality of the meats were great! Customer service was great as well! The only thing I didn't like was that you can only order one steamed egg per table, and it's the small bowl.  Like really? This is supposed to feed my whole family? Other than that I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. The food is okay but the service is terrible. We asked for extra small plates for seaweed salads in them as our plates (already small to start with) were getting full. The lady said in a very rude tone that we can put the seaweed salads in our plates. We ended up getting the plates ourselves, which as a result we got educated on how we couldn't just grab our own plates. Afterwards, the lady was totally rude: ignored our orders, gave us dirty looks, laughed at us back in her station, etc. When we asked to change server, the manager had to PULL her back as if she wanted to go ape shit on us. We used to come here all the time but we will no longer come to this place. I will not recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD FOOD, really long lines though. If you're here for a convention expect at least an hour wait. We waited nearly 2 hours which is the only reason they aren't getting a 5 star review. Their big problem is table turnaround, 5 tables were empty for 20 minutes waiting for them to clear them."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of KBBQ and this is bomb!! The experience and foods was amazing. My wife and I had drinks and fun.  The experience here is much different in Texas. Eating here made us feel cool.  They were serving until 2am like it's bar. Come here to get your grill on and walk next door for dessert - snow monster."}
{"text":"I have to say the food is great, but the service SUCKS... I swear I saw at least 5 employees running around the little restaurant, but it took about 15 minutes for us to get recognized (we literally had to flag someone down in order for this to happen). And this is for BOTH times of us coming here. The first time was for lunch on a weekday and there were only 3 other tables seated at be time; the second time was during  a busier dinner rush. I like the food. But I'm going to keep looking for a place that has better service.. I mean the food is raw. All you have to do is BRING IT OUT AND WE COOK IT. Come one guys."}
{"text":"I want to say that this is honestly the best kbbq I've been to in Vegas. How come I haven't tried this place sooner?!  My brother and I walk in at about 5 on a Thursday afternoon. We are seated promptly and the place isn't too packed. But shortly thereafter, it gets filled up pretty quickly.  As we sit, there are already side dishes laid out on the table -- impressive. The potato salad, fish cake, and rice paper were my favorites. Our server, Jitto, was quick to take our orders as well. He was very free in offering his suggestions but I like when servers do that. It gives me a feel for different types of meat and trying new things. We ordered the brisket and bulgogi about two times each, the pork ribs, beef short ribs, beef belly, and pork belly. The portion sizes came out perfect! Not too much and not too little of meat. SADLY, only ONE order of steamed egg is allowed per table. Per table?! Not per person? And not AYCE? That's my one gripe about this place. Because I fricken love steamed egg, lol. But oh well.   Customer service was beyond excellent. Someone was always filling our waters, changing out our grill if it became blackened over, and we were constantly checked on to see if we wanted to place more orders.   Will definitely come back. I need more brisket in my life."}
{"text":"I'm wondering if I should rate this place Vegas standards or LA standards? This is is better than Tofu Hut but its still not that great also.   It's $20 all you can eat and they actually have a lot of options and appetizers to choose from. I tried the beef belly, beef tongue, sliced ribeye, and marinated short rib.   Nothing really stuck out to me. I was a little weirded out seeing the beef tongue so frozen that it broke like glass when you touched it. Plus if you cook it too long it would turn rubbery.   The menu also came with a small cheese corn, steamed egg, and soup which was plus for me! I also liked their banchan sides.   The service was good. They changed our grills whenever we asked."}
{"text":"Always a good time and fun service from the guys at hwaro! Coming in hungry and leaving with food coma."}
{"text":"my family loooove it here! even my 7 & 2 year old! lol !!  btw yea the wait times are crazy but what do you expect for a place that is soooo good everyones gonna want it !!! duh"}
{"text":"Great service, and i loved the quality of everything I tried. Make sure to get The Shit and KFC appetizers. The tongue and rib eye is exceptional."}
{"text":"One of the best! Order pork cheek. Its one of their unique meat you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Las Vegas I have been introduced to a world of \"all you can eat\" Hwaro was one of them. This was one of my first times trying Korean BBQ and I enjoyed it! I love how interactive it was, it made it exciting and fun! I wanted to try everything. They have a great selection of different types of meats. My fave was prob the beef belly and skirt steak. There are a few appetizers. \"The shit\" was recommended as a must try. I thought it was alright. As I ate on I started getting pretty full off meat and wanted some veggies but the options were limited. I settled for the house salad to get my veggie fix. I think maybe a couple more appetizer options or veggies would I give it 5 stars. All in all it was excellent from quality of food to service! It does get busy so there is a little bit of a wait time but get there early and it's not too bad. I do look forward to the ice cream coffee dessert at the end. I wish I can get seconds it so good!"}
{"text":"Hwaro stepped it up on my recent visit with service and food turned into 4 stars! The \"All You Can Eat\" Korean BBQ hits the spot. Workers gave quick and friendly service... they were all definitely on point. This restaurant has great quality meats with 3 dipping sauces along with plentiful fresh sides! I also like how they give you a container of water so you can refill your glass which is cool. My faves here are the: bulgogi, brisket, and pork belly!! Yummy yummy.~"}
{"text":"Delish! Everyone should try this place! Best Korean BBQ in town! I've tried a couple places and so far this the best."}
{"text":"I did not expect such a quality experience for the price.   Please note, I'm comparing HWARO to barbeque restaurants I've dined in Korea, and it starts with the KIMCHI! It's certainly a different taste than others I've tried as its more mild, but I enjoy it. They gave us plenty for our table of 7 and were quick to resupply.   Roughly 50 cuts of meat and seafood are available,  and although I stuck with mostly the beef dishes I didn't find any problems with them. \"The S**t\" is surprisingly good too, give it a shot.   The staff was must accommodating,  too, but I won't go into the details on that one ;). Excellent service,  we thank you once again!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we tried it out. If I could give 6 stars, I would! This has to be the best Korean bbq restaurant I've ever eaten at. Great service, great food, and they're open late! Highly recommended. Will have to come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean BBQ open late and many side dishes to choose from. You must try the shit! Literally it's delicious and no it's not the bad type. Me and the wifey keeps coming back for more! Cute place and well themed atmosphere! Very up beat and feels like Asia!"}
{"text":"Great Food & Customer Service! AYCE Dinner for only $19.99, can't beat that for the quality and amount of food that you are getting :)"}
{"text":"I was super impressed by all the banchan that covered table. I was excited to finally get to try rice paper with my kbbq and their kimchi is the best I've had from a restaurant!  The menu is massive so you will not have a hard time finding food to fill your cravings. I wish I had more room in my belly to try everything! My favorites were the brisket, beef belly, squid and cheese corn. Mmm the cheese corn here is really garlicky and sweet.   Definitely try the yogurt soju! I don't think ours was mixed properly so the first shot tasted like plain soju. But the next rounds were so tasty! Like an adult version of those tiny yogurt drinks we drank as kids.   The service was super slow. There were many empty tables when my group of four got there, but we still had to wait 20 min to be seated. We had to flag our waiter down every time we wanted to order more meat, and we had to ask twice for a refill on our water and salad.   However, for the authenticity and cheap price, I do not mind having bad service. I will still be back for more and you bet this will be my go to place to take all my friends who visit me in town!"}
{"text":"The food and server were good at first but after 45 min of being here they turned off my grill, gave me my check and started being rude after I told them we weren't done. I asked them to turn it back on and we ordered more. Their time limit is 1 hour and 30 min. The female worker Nametag J gave us meat that were rock hard frozen and the mussel didn't look as appetizing like the previous one I ordered. I ate the meat and it was really chewy. She gave us the bad meat because we didn't leave. I come here all the time and this is the first time they did this to me. It's unexeptable to rush a customer while they're eating"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna go through and describe every single thing I ate here because ain't nobody have time for that.   My wife and I went on a Saturday night.   Waited to get a seat for about 45 minutes if I had to estimate.   Parking lot is awful and hard to find a spot but there are worse things in life than that, right?  This is the deal, it was $22.95 each for the all you can eat.  This doesn't include drinks or anything else.     I'd suggest getting some appetizers to mix in with all the meats.   Meat is great but sometimes you need a break and need some crunch with a change of pace.     The highlights (all these things were worth ordering and maybe even getting seconds)  Eggs rolls, The Shit, Korean Fried Chicken, skirt steak (regular and spicy both good), short rib, beef bugolgi.      The mediumlights (might order again):  Beef tongue, Green muscles, Enoki beef, brisket.     The lowlights (wouldn't order again)  Pork Belly (was somehow dry and not very flavorful.   Took me a while to be able to get it down)  Beef Flank (on the salty side and not very tender)  Sweet and Spicy Tofu (Was neither sweet or spicy.  They must have left the sweet and spicy back in the kitchen when they brought it out to us.   Most bland thing I've eaten in a while)   I don't remember our waiters name but he was very attentive and friendly.   Very on top of asking us if we needed more food and changing out of cooking grill.    I am stuffed as hell writing this review.   There is a 10% chance I end up with medical issues from overeating tonight.  But I'm all good with that.   Cool place, would go back.  But probably need some time to recover.    P.S- it's $19.95 is you go after 10pm or before 4pm."}
{"text":"So happy I was finally able to make a trip down here after how many visits to Vegas. What was supposed to be a trip to Kung Fu Tea (also amazing) turned into having dinner here. Yes, the wait may have been a hour for 2 people on a Thursday night, but what do you expect during the holidays?   The quality of the meat didn't leave me feeling nauseous like other all you can eat KBBQ restaurants, service was spectacular even though they were crazy packed. Never once did I feel neglected or forgotten and we were sat in the back corner. The $22.95 price can't be beat for 56 dinner items, you can't go there and not find something that you like. And when they say \"must try\" you don't ignore that. The shake shake rice was AH-MAZE-ING. I could have cared less for \"The Shit\" but only because I'm not a fan of shellfish. My friend loved it though so that's confirmation enough that it's The Shit, haha.   I'm not too sure if it's because I live in Hawaii and we have yet to experience AYCE KBBQ like the west coast, but my mind seems to be blown every time I take a trip to the mainland."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food, and attentive service! You'll definitely be filled with the selection of food/dishes. It's best to come early if you're going for dinner b/c the wait can be quite long (this statement is for rude & impatient customers). There is a time limit once you sit down, so eat up while you can! There's definitely better places for meat quality but for the price you pay, it's worth it. Overall, I like this place, there are a few hits & misses whenever we visit but that's understandable."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Strongly recommended on the shake shake rice and skirt steak."}
{"text":"Very clean, fast paced restaurant. It's really a great joint if you're willing to wait 30 mins to an hour. They're pretty fast with service, they definitely have a great variety ! Didnt really like the kimchi as much as I thought I would, but every side was pretty much pleasing ! I definitely would come back here when I visit !"}
{"text":"First off where are all the complimentary sides like the steamed egg, cheese corn, soy bean paste soup, and the pumpkin drink. I never got any of these  :( super sad I was looking forward to it. The potatoe salad side dish  had apples in it kind of weird but it was good.   The salad was very tasteful I love the ginger and vinegar combo. This place offers baby octopus which was well marinated and delicious. Didn't try a variety of meat except for the brisket and tounge.   Also we got a bad table (table 3) the fire kept going out, they came to turn the stove on 3 times in less than 20 minutes. Ugh that was very fustrating so I asked to be moved to another table. Other than that I might be back hopefully to update my review and give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"The service, the food, the environment was superb!  And the price for AYCE was affordable!"}
{"text":"The price is fair and the service is good too?I would recommand to my friends??????????????????"}
{"text":"Got to Hwaro at about 11pm and were told that they were closing early that night. Not wanting to be a dick I said I would just come back the next day but they insisted it was OK. The service was great and the food was awesome. I was speeding through my meal still feeling bad we had kept them open for us but I would definitely come back and try more of the menu.  Get the Korean fried chicken and \"the shit\""}
{"text":"So not sure after over thousand reviews much more to add but going give it a shot. I have been to few ayce Korean spots around town. Really for the most part I feel not much difference between any of them, The protein selection and the sides see lot of similar menu items. Also there be some things on menu that might not see at other spots around town. The one key thing for me is the quality of the proteins and got have some tongue on the menu. Bias opinion since that my favorite meats comes to Korean Barbeque. The quality of the proteins is another standard that judge me some Korean Barbeque. The amount of side dishes always leaves impression for me. The quality of the protein was very fresh and really good. I came with big group of family visiting from Sac Town. They were ordering the meats for the most part and just taking whatever was on the grill cooking. The sides were solid. I must admit seen few more at other spots but when going ayce it not like you need all the sides. Less room for the good stuff. Lol!   It small place in small location but one that literally mini melting pot of food off the strip. We went at the worst time on friday night so wait time of over 1hr half. I had my doubts being first time. Honest it was worth the patience and the wait. Or do what we did walk next door to Kung Fu Tea for some boba drinks, conversations, and time killer. The parking for that small melting pot suck straight up and no way around it on the weekends or prime dinner hours. If the lot full just find street parking or across the street in front of some church people parking in that lot no problems. The price is actually one of the cheaper ones for ayce style Korean Barbeque. You definitely getting your money worth by the time you leave Hwaro.  The staff was great! We had big party think was 11 in all. So got one of the long middle tables with two burners for our party. It worked out perfect. They were on top of everything from our drinks. Making sure if we were good or needed put more protein orders or sides in. Everyone was friendly. Low ceiling so was surprise but the ventilation system was solid cause with all that cooking going on never felt like getting smoked out the whole time. The MUSIC added another vibe  to the whole evening at Hwaro. It was pretty cool. They got couple wide screens and had music videos of k-pop music I can only assume. It was not soft or so loud you could still have conversations over dinner. Stood out compare to any other Korean Barbeque no doubt. Fan!   The only thing is get mind set that going wait to get seated depending the time of the day. It worth the wait!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places I've eaten. Food is bomb. Atmosphere is cool. The concept of cooking your own food at your own table is hella cool. Plus the choices of sauces they give are pretty good. Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Awesome service very professional, they had so many options that I haven't seen at any other Korean bbq restaurant definitely will be going back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Me and a friend of mine decided to come here for an early dinner after work. They have a number of good options for the ayce deal. For only $22.95, you can eat a variety of foods including appetizers and side dishes. Their salad is really good, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Me, my hubby, and son came in right when they opened. It's in a cute niche of a spot, right next to Monta. Service was ok / decent ( the server had 3 tables all at once so I understand ) /// but he noticed my son right away and offered a high chair which is nice. $19.99 for ayce KBBQ, which is a deal, and what we did. Took about 15-20 mins to really get our order in. We first got served our side dishes, and then later our meats for us to grill on our table top. Our burner died a few times, so 3xs we had to flag our server. We eventually got moved to a different table. Overall the food was great, sides and marinated meat. I would like to try again."}
{"text":"Love the selection of their menu. Especially short ribs is the best, very juicy and tender. My son can finish the whole plate by himself  They also have many option of the appetizer, price is good, service is good too. Overall compare to other Korean AYCE place, we enjoy this one very much."}
{"text":"Tender taste and yet so inviting. The waiter was cordial, but the food was fresh and flavorful! Ask for Masa!"}
{"text":"Great service and yummy dessert! It also has such cute decor and makes eating much more enjoyable"}
{"text":"I love the choices and variety. Great place to come with friends. Lots of sides, and you should really try the peach soju! Delicious!"}
{"text":"There's an all you can eat option but you must have a minimum of 2 in your party. It is really worth it. We went for lunch.  There's a good variety of different traditional Korean dishes and appetizers on this menu. It gives you options for sauces and sides also.   I just love the Korean red bean dip and they make a great version. We tried almost everything in the menu (but, be careful, it says that if you over order that you will be charged a la carte prices.) Alright I had no problem finishing everything because it was so good and rich in flavor. My taste buds were going wild with the strong and hearty taste that they have in each of the dishes.   There's a dish called \"The Shit\" and it is...'the shit'! It's got a great side sauce to go with it and just like the menu suggests, it is a \"must try.\" The other \"must try\" was a rice shaker and it's basically a bibimbap. It was great but not what I'm used to bibimbap being because it was in a different container and was loose but the ingredients were the same. So it's like bibimbap but a 'shaker' because it was shaken up in the container.  Everything was really worth trying at least once and some items I ordered twice.   I've never been to Korea but I've been to k-town and I instantly felt like I was there after walking inside. Great ambiance and comfortable seats.   I would recommend to a friend for sure"}
{"text":"Best AYCE BBQ in town for the best price!  Nice atmosphere,  very clean, great selection!"}
{"text":"Hwaro is not worth being called korean restaurant.hey... yelpers. Let me tell you something and wanna disclose a fact. Go check this out at night  back side of the kictchen of the restaurant. You can realize creepy family group of rats and roaches travel around to enjoy their feast. Sooooooo scary and yucky....  what do inspectors check about when they come ? Yelpers ! You guys can a photo of a dead roach on logs of photos customers uploaded on main page of yelp. This insanitary restaurant including all of restaurant in the mall should be closed and solve this hygene issue .They serve garbage and junk foods. never come again . Below par."}
{"text":"I used to eat here before and I used to be happy bringing all my friends here to try a new kbbq spot.   As soon as we sat down, we ordered all the meat cause we were hungry. We only ordered beef tongue and brisket to start. We had no idea it would take 25 minutes to bring out 2 plates of raw meat. We were fine for the first 15 minutes cause we had the small side dishes, but after that we had to say something to the waiters. They didn't bring it out for another 10 minutes. By then, the rice was already cold and the grill was so hot that the meat literally cooked in less than 10 seconds and stuck to the grill. It was like eating ground beef. It was one of my friend's first time, and she got so pissed that she left after one bite. Not to mention she asked for more sides when we asked about the meat, and they haven't even brought it out even after she left.  So we decided to order more meat. We asked to triple the last order and add pork and bulgogi  because we were a group of 6 (now 5). So we waited another 20 minutes. They gave us less meat than the first order?!?!? I was pissed. Sitting there for almost 50 minutes and they only took our meat orders twice and gave us less meat when we asked for more. I decided to complain to the manager. Never have I ever had that bad of an experience at kbbq. Most places may take a while to refill waters but they're usually quick with the meat. This place took forever to refill and bring out raw meat. How hard is it to bring out raw meat? They don't even cook it.  Then the waiter comes back and apologizes. Homeboy said \"sorry I was lazy before but now I changed cause yea\" we all looked at each other like wtf? Who says that? After that they were quicker on bringing out the meat. But by the third time we made our order it was already over an hour of sitting there munching on the sides and we were getting full. But we ordered a lot more just so we can try to get somewhat of our money's worth. We asked for double of 4 different meats. They still gave us less than the single order. They were a little quicker this time but it still took 10 minutes to bring out.   The waiter came back again and didn't even apologize. He made an excuse. He said the other table made a reservation so they were busier accommodating them. Wtf does having a reservation have anything to do with service? We waited like 20 minutes outside prior to eating. I guess you should make a reservation next time so they treat you better. Then he said we can't discount anything but we can give you free soda. Wtf is free soda gonna do? We were just fed up and asked for the check.  They charged us for 6 orders, even though it was only 5 of us eating cause our friend left before the meat came because the service was that horrible. They have some nerve adding auto gratuity for shitty service, I had to say something again.  I've eaten here multiple times and i usually am pleased with the experience. I don't know if it was because it was all guys working but they suck. Just standing around with their dick in their hands doing nothing and admitting to being lazy."}
{"text":"Such a great experienced at Korean BBQ spotted in Vegas. Close to the strip and the food is awesome. Waitress are very friendly and very helpful at explaining the menu. Definitely coming back next time when we go to Vegas again. We went a group as 20 and only waited for 5-10 min."}
{"text":"Ive been on the hunt for a good ayce kbbq place in vegas. I have been here twice and both experiences were really different. The first time was great, my boyfriend and i really enjoyed it. But the second time around, all we could taste was the sanitizer? that they use to clean the dishes. Either that or it was the water they used for cooking and making the dipping sauce. I hope that was just that one time, but scared to go back and give jt another chance.  Other than that, this place is very true to the original kbbq. Good selection of meats, though I dont recommend many.. banchans are good, they have steamed egg, rice paper, and bean paste stew (very important in kbbq but so many places dont have it in vegas). I dont think i will be able to find a ayce kbbq that's satisfying.. expensive, but trying kangnam next!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. Very quick service, good food,good prices.. Nice atmosphere inside.. The waiting list is long but it's worth it.."}
{"text":"Have been here three times and each time it is great. They bring out the food right away. They always change the pans without having to ask them. There is a good deal of 3 dollars more for almost the entire menu! There flank stake is to die for, that I dream about it.  For appetizers the bulgogi nachos are awesome! The Korean fried chicken is also a thing you should order, as well as the dumplings!  They have a peach soju (alcohol) that taste good!"}
{"text":"I had never tried Korean BBQ and this became my favorite restaurant. Friendly staff, amazing food and service. If you go in a big group, be prepare to wait because this restaurant always has line but this is not a problem. In the end you'll enjoy for sure. Try it and enjoy"}
{"text":"Best AYCE kbbq in town. If your here in Vegas u must it. It might be a long wait for dinner time but it's totally worth it. Must come hungry to be able to try everything. Try there premium steak, mussle, seafood salad (if you like sashimi), \"the shit\", cheese corn, potato salad. They offer good customer service as well and  all of their servers are very attentive and friendly. Also you get a scoop of ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Both times are consistent... Pretty great food, pretty meh service. I feel like once we get seated, the servers are cool. But it's the seating part that brings this place down a notch. You're treated like a second class citizen until you actually sit down and, as far as my two experiences have gone, are finally treated like a paying customer. Maybe they just need a better hostess, I dunno. Bottom line = Great food; okay service."}
{"text":"Rude owner! Old korean woman rushes you out and stares at you the whole time. Food was bland. Wont come here again. We walked out and we said thank you then she frowned and looked us up and down. How can she do that to a pregnant woman?! Rude!  There are more 24hr korean bbq spots near by. Our party of 3 was very disappointed. Old Korean lady sent the bus boy over to take some plates while we were still eating and brought the check too early. Also, they are understaffed. The floor and tables are dirty. The grill burns up too quick. Waiter came 2 times, once at the start and once at the end of the meal.  Never again!"}
{"text":"It's too bad that our service wasn't great tonight, because the food was delicious. We started off with one waitress, and after bringing out first round of meat out, she started to pass our table by. The waitress helping the other side of the room, including the couple sitting next to us on the community table, eventually came over and asked if we needed anything. I noticed that she paid attention to her people way more than she came to help us, and she even spoke at length to that couple next to us.   Maybe I'm mistaken, but what appears to have happened is that our first waitress probably thought the other waitress would take our table (since she was helping the couple next to us). However, there must have been a  lack of communication because we were basically left alone for the entire meal. We had to wait forever to ask someone for water, and my boyfriend didn't even get a chance to ask for rice until after we had finished the meat. Disappointed with the negligence.   As for meat, I recommend: skirt steak (suuuper tender), ribeye, pork belly (prefer the regular to the green tea one) , special steak on the \"all day\" menu (be careful not to overcook it) and beef tongue.   Shake shake rice is almost like if kimchi fried rice and bibimbap had a baby. Not spicy, and pretty good. I wasn't impressed with \"The Shit\" (deep fried nori stuffed with imitation crab and special sauce) though people seem to really like it.   Hopefully I'll have better luck with the service if I ever find myself back here."}
{"text":"I love this place...best all you can eat korean bbq place in all of vegas....service is great food is great the environment is overall great...kid friendly and best of all the price is best bank for ur buck...cant get that kind of food and service at that price...recommend this place to everyone...local and visiters"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday night. There is a little wait before I sat. Woww.. on Monday night.  This place is awesome. The price is very reasonable  and the choice of meat is fabulous. They have plenty. You can order half if you think you want to try a new thing and in case you don't like it. I love their octopus and skirt steak. The rib eye and short rib is ok tho. Can't complain with the price that I pay.   Service just fine. I think it's run in any Korean restaurant. Only at magal and hobak you will get a good service. well i guess it because they have a la carte, not AYCE.  The server not even tell me what kind of meat that they bring it over, if they don't want to explained it to all customer that's fine, but at least ask whether or not we want to know. The meat plate that he brought, he kind of threw it at the side of the table. So rude!!   Come back? Maybe. I just hope that I'm not get serve by that rude waiter again."}
{"text":"This place was better than any Korean Barbeque I've had in both Seoul and Maryland! The pricing was better as well, with everything all you can eat, to include the appetizers. Definitely recommend trying the \"The Shit\" as an appetizer. All in all...very delicious food! I only wish we had one here in in MD."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with some of our family friends. All you can eat for dinner is around $20 per head. Lunch is around $17 per head which is ok. The food was good. The beef and chicken bulgogi tasted good and the side dishes were ok. They don't have though those spicy mochi rice cakes i love. Service and ambience were also good. Overall, its a pretty good place to eat but there are other places closer to where we live that have the same food."}
{"text":"My new go to kbbq place. Prices are good and the meat quality is great. Parking sucks but that's not their problem. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The service is slow and even though your still eating they are cleaning and trying to hurry you up and set up for the next customer. It happened to us twice. So if u guys wants to eat and try to chill out this place is no good. It's so rude that your still eating and they are wiping the tables already and ur not done talking to that older lady who serves she's turning her  back. They are trying to accommodate all customers but they have a small place."}
{"text":"Was looking for something satisfying and tasty....Hwaro hit the spot. There food delicious especially the short rib."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Vegas my cousin always suggests getting kbbq. I finally gave in during my last trip out here.  Came here on a Monday night and waited close to an hour, which was obvi a good sign. I will say, it was worth the wait!   Finally got seated and immediately ordered the brisket, steak, beef wrapped enoki, short ribs, bolgogi nachos, gyoza, and cheese corn for starters. Everything came out so fast. All of the items we tried were delicious. Our go-to was the brisket, since it's so tasty and easy to cook.  The bolgogi nachos were delish. I've never had that at any other kbbq spot. I also enjoyed the enoki beef. Everything else we tried was good too and continued to keep them coming until our hearts content.  The servers were attentive, constantly asking if we're okay and even providing us with another water container without having to ask.  This place lived up to the hype. You can't beat the quality of food and service for only $20! I wish they had Hwaro back in the bay, I'd be here all the time!   Oooh! Also they serve ice cream/affogato at the end of your meal. AYCE KBBQ does not get better than this!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Cool atmosphere, there all you can eat menu has a wide variety of choices. I would recommend getting the red wine pork belly!!"}
{"text":"Best k barbs ever!! We waited 3-4 hours for our party of 12 on a Friday night, but so worth it lol"}
{"text":"First time here food is fantastic! The service is outstanding!  We had the all day all you can eat. Tried almost everything on the main menu. Yummmm"}
{"text":"FYI. No rice paper  sauces are good, steam egg but tofu soup is plain. -1 star for no rice paper"}
{"text":"Girls night out on a Friday evening 7pm and the place was packed! Almost an hour wait but well worth it. Only reason I gave it a 4 is no seating while you wait. Not really a hostess available you sign in on a sheet and wait. However food options were plentiful and prices were reasonable. Great service once we sat down. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The bbq is da bomb here we love coming here and the sauce is just wonderful!!!  Must try the box kimchi rice!"}
{"text":"I know it was a Friday and Friday's are typically busy for most restaurants but hot damn our wait was a whopping 2.5 hours!!! Now you're probably saying \"Why the F*#! would anyone wait that long?\"...well because one it is so hard to find parking anywhere near China town and two because the hostess said it would may be take an hour or less and three we had kids with us who were restless and four I was told it was a pretty good place for Korean BBQ AYCE.  Any how the restaurant is small with only 8 booths (seats 4 comfortably) and 3 long tables (seats maybe 12 comfortably). There was one other long table but was set up for the people waiting to be seated as well as 3 other booths utilized for the same purpose...so pretty useless and a waste of dining space.  Once seated we were told that the kids would be charged full price at $19.99 (although they only wanted to eat a couple appetizers) so before you come with kids keep in mind kids ages 0-2 free, 3-7 are half price and ages 7 and above full price.  Now the food: the menu selection was good, lotsa variety of meat selection. The side dishes could be better, but you do get a good amount. The Korean KFC is to die for! They're small popcorn like crispy fried chicken with a sweet spicy sauce drizzled on top. The gyoza and egg rolls are just like any other but still pretty tasty.  I give the service a 5 star because the waitress was very attentive as she frequently came to our table changing the grill and taking our orders. The hostess was nice BUT seriously needs to work on her \"timing\", I mean if the place is busy just be honest about the wait time. Other than that, I'd come back...just not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"They have a loooog line.... I was waiting more than 30 mints but it was worth it!!! Price is so good!!! (Cheap really!!) Meat quality was so good!!! Uaslly I went to other place for korean bbq and not try to all you can eat for meat quility matters...anyway bottom line is I am so satisfied with food and service!! Pork rib, brisket, squid, spicy beef was awesome!! Side dish kept refilling!!! Nice!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife on a date night.  My favorite was the skirt steak but all the items we tried were delicious.  Service was very good.  Key things I appreciate the most in a restaurant.  Only draw back is they don't have the traditional Korean salad like other places and no japchae.  I would still come back though.  A colleague of mine raved about this place and it didn't disappoint!  Also for dessert, we had the green tea ice cream which was better than most places and the affogato which was also very good!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue beef and various other kinds of meat. Nice environment, delicious food, great flavors all you can eat. Excellent! Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Oooh, Vegas has built many new Korean restaurants since i was there last. Howard is where Seoul Kwon used to be (back in the day); it is delicious.   The setup is nice, the service is good, and the food is delicious. I miss this place already. Three of us went for dinner, and I would suggest going around 4:00 p.m. to miss the rush. We had the \"all day special,\" so we could get more variety of the meats.  The banchan were fresh and aplenty. The meats were fresh, and we also got the mushroom wrapped in meat; i think you can only get one per person because it's such high demand. It was delicious!! Then we got dessert; the affogato is sooooo good! I recommend this place. $25/person? Shoot - you cannot beat it - especially for scrumptious food!"}
{"text":"My food prayers have been answered! There's a new KBBQ place in town and for $19.99 AYCE dinner. Heck yeah! The couple my husband and I usually dine with decided to go for lunch. Lunch is $16.99 but for $3 extra per person, we decided to splurge (LOL) and get the dinner AYCE. We looked at the menu and when we ordered, we discovered that one of our menus had tape over some of the items to indicate they were no longer available. The BOGO free beer was a tease, no free desserts included & no green tea smoked pork belly. :( This is minor but they were out of Hite beer but they had Cass beer. I know some of my peeps might care about that so I thought I would mention that.  It's your standard AYCE KBBQ place, you start off with sangchu geotjeori (Korean lettuce salad), a wide assortment of banchan (side dishes), sauces & sides for your meat-sesame oil dip, spicy chili dip, ssamjang, garlic cloves, and jalapeños. Looking at other photos from people who have went before me, I was disappointed to not get the some of my favorite banchan. In one of the photos, they received more banchan. They don't usually include corn cheese but I didn't get that either!! WTF!  Meats: Our group ordered the brisket, pork belly, short ribs, flank steak, bulgogi, and baby octopus (they were out of baby octopus so they substituted it with squid which was fine with us). No major complaints. Good enough. The chadol and pork belly were thick and good. Galbi was my least favorite.  Also included was your typical doenjang chigae (fermented soybean paste stew). It had a good flavor but it was missing tofu. I don't remember having this stew without tofu. The gyeran jjim (steamed egg casserole) was terrible! No scallions, it was bland, and had a burnt aftertaste.  Service could be better. She didn't ask if we wanted more banchan nor helped us with the meat (not that I need it but it's nice when they do). Overall, it's still a steal for $20 when the other KBBQ places in this town charge $25-$33. I was disappointed to not get a lot of the items in the photos but can't really complain too much when it's $19.99."}
{"text":"Me and my guy went late night after work. It was a fun, casual atmosphere. The servers weren't the most attentive and didn't really seem in the mood to describe menu items and answer questions. We tried the shake shake rice witch I thought was a super clever presentation of kimchi fried rice. But at the end of the day, it was just average kimchi fried rice. I like that the AYCE portions are small. It gives you the opportunity to try a lot of different items and not fill up on just 2 or 3 like other Korean BBQ places in town.  All in all, I'll come back. But only for the fact that it's open late and allows me to eat something tasty and wholesome for a good price."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in town! The interior is also super cute and the service is always on point."}
{"text":"Bad service made the average korean food horrible. They made us tip for  4 people on the check for horrific service. Never again will I go here. Why did it have 4 stars. Such a lie"}
{"text":"Love all you can eat, nice looking place.  Lots of meats to choose from. Probably will come back in the future when visiting Vegas"}
{"text":"Wake up kids, we've got the dreamers disease...  AYCE for $20...how can you go wrong? Well, if you were expecting amazing or even good cuts of meat at this price you were in fact dreaming with me.  Hwaro is the place to go if you're looking to fill up on Korean BBQ, are on a budget, and love to smell like you just hung out at a Korean campfire for the rest of the night. I'm really not going to hate on Hwaro that much. As is often the case, you seriously get exactly what you pay for here...maybe even a little more. You're paying for a bunch of cheap cuts of meat and tasty sauces, resulting in what some will appreciate, but what I find a waste.   I am certainly biased. I try to limit my intake of meat products and seldomly splurge on AYCE. But even if I'm eating meat, I find it far more enjoyable to spend more on better quality.   If you do come here give yourself extra time to park in this cash cow food plaza, or come off peak hours, which may be a good idea anyway--the staff was very friendly, but had a difficult time keeping up with the tables. The banchan sides were ample, but nothing special.  ...and in the end, the love you take Is equal to the love you make"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite place to eat KBBQ (but honestly I haven't tried any other place in Vegas and I'm not planning to any time soon). The brisket, short ribs, and beef tongue are my favorites. They also have a variety of sides and appetizers to try while you wait for the meat to cook. After your meal, they offer ice cream (either green tea or coffee) to each member of the party.   My only complaint would be the wait and how the staff handles the rush. There is almost always a long line of parties (when I come) and it's a surprise that the staff hasn't figured out a more efficient way to handle many customers by now. When I was here with a few friends, we had to consistently check the waitlist to see how many people were before us. We did this because we noticed how the host sometimes crossed off parties before they are seated; it causes a mess because there are more complaints and the line is held up for an even longer period of time. I also noticed how the host didn't go outside to check for the next party on the list and that seemed to cause an issue as well, because those who are outside never know if it's their turn. I understand that some places don't usually consistently check outside, but sometimes it's so crowded that customers have no choice but to wait outside.  Conclusion: if you don't mind waiting a long while, then it's a 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the best... \"the shit\" is the best a staple whenever u come here... great meat selection and all taste soo good...  our go to korean bbq.. great atmosphere.. the staff are friendly and responsive.. affordable and DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! The best Korean BBQ. Can't believe how cheap it is. Everything is fresh and delicious. I suggest go earlier before 8pm on weekend it can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"Well hello AYC Korean bbq! Just had the pleasure of enjoying some good quality and good price Korean bbq today. For all those Kbbq lovers this is a MUST try new place in town.They serve abundt of  banchan  (side dishes) and good quality beef. Sadly they didnt had beef brisket because they ran out of it... Everything was awesome except the salad. According to my friend the salad dressing is more similar to WoonamJung dressing. When going for lunch ask for \"All Day Special\" beacuse you can get a whole lot of beef options than normal AYC Lunch. Its only $19.99"}
{"text":"ONLY GIVING THIS PLACE A 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GIVE IT ANY LESS.   I've read all the reviews for this place \"great service, great food.\" WHAT A BUNCH OF LIES. I came with a party of 5 and they have an automatic 15% gratuity added to parties of 4 or more! So the waiters don't even work for their tips! Our waiter DOROTHY was awful! She was so rude and purposefully gave us the wrong order, made a rude remark about it, and then laughed! NOT TO MENTION when we needed to ask questions she would just ignore what we asked completely. If she is your waiter I recommend you ask for a new one.   Also I see that they have a lot great reviews here, I'm sure it's because they give you a free drink with a yelp review. That is bullshit.   PEOPLE DON'T GIVE OTHER YELP USERS FALSE REVIEWS OF THIS PLACE FOR A FREE DRINK.  All in all ,10/10 would not recommend and we certainly won't be back!!!!   I suggest Tofu Hut as a nice replacement"}
{"text":"not that long of a wait for us. just got off of work and met family from out of town here. forgot to make a reservation but we actually waited less than 10 mins and had a table already. very good food. beef flank has to be our favorite. as well as \"the shit\"! it's a perfect name because it really is the shit! bomb!"}
{"text":"This has instantly become my favorite Korean place in Las Vegas, following the closure of Maru some time ago.  Their banchan is far superior to any other place I've been to in the city, and this is a huge plus for me. They also give free soup and steamed egg, which I think is a fantastic value considering they also offer cheaper prices than many others.  The meat is solid, but not great, and the service is ok - very friendly, but not very attentive. They do tend to forget about you a bit when they get busy.  Bottom line: dollar-for-dollar, this is an excellent deal and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My new favorite korean bbq! It's AYCE at a very affordable price. IMO, hwaro is better than sura. I love the food!!! Service is great(once you are seated lol). The only problem is the place is always crowded/busy, hence the long wait, I think we waited for 30 mins. or so before we were seated. But overall, I still give it two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Bomb AYCE!'!!!! Late night specials and their banchan is awesome. I definitely recomend for AYCE either All day specials or lunch/late night."}
{"text":"Just went there for my first time last night we waited for about 45 mins but it was worth it. The food was beyond delicious. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"The meat is pretty high quality and the service is good. They replaced my chopsticks 3 times because I dropped them every time."}
{"text":"This is my second time here at Hwaro. I lived in South Korean for over two years and this has to be the most Korean style and taste to the real thing. The first time while eating here I was having flashbacks and this amazing Korean style food and culture. The Kpop music just added the cherry on top!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on reading others' review.  Not bad at all!  Meat selection is good.  Only thing i didn't like is their steam egg.  Tastes like butter was added.  A bit strange to add that to a traditional style dish.   Second time here today. Steam egg is done right this time. Great taste on everything."}
{"text":"I went with several friends. It was an great atmosphere. Excellent place for Korean BBQ. You will leave happy and full!"}
{"text":"Im from San Francisco and we have Gen Korean BBQ all around. Found this place on yelp had great reviews decided to check it out. Basically its an \"ALL YOU CAN EAT,\" type of Korean BBQ. Not bad for the price either, for $22.95 per person and you can have everything thats on their menu. When I first arrived at the restaurant via Uber, first thing I noticed was the huge crowd of people waiting outside to get in. With that said you know this place is rockin and the food obviously must be off the hook. The wait wasn't too bad. The restaurant has about 11 tables that seat 4 and about 3 huge tables that seat big parties. We tried the following items  Beef Bulgogi (3 orders) Pork Belly (1 order) Squid (1 order) Beef Brisket (2 orders) Prime Rib Steak (1 order p/person) Short Ribs (2 orders) Pickled Daicon is really good Seaweed Salad was good Vanilla Ice cream in coffee, corn flakes and toffee awesome.  Definitely a place to eat when in Las Vegas. Meat quality just as great as Gen's and the ambience of is rocking. Music is uplifting makes you want to get up and dance. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I came here on a date, and it was much better than expected. The brisket, sirloin, and tripe were delicious, and the side dishes were yummy too. 5/5 food. The setting was really cute and comfortable as well.   The only issue was that they lost our credit card after we paid (as in the card never came back to our table after we received the check). But we retrieved it again, after going to the front desk. So... The staff probably should keep better track of that. :(  Other than that, it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Quality of meats are very fresh and delicious. For $20 all you can eat is very worth it, and it also includes side dishes of vegetables and other aunthetic korean side dishes.Atmosphere is very good for groups. Workers are very attentive and very professional. If your looking for Korean style food and for a good time hwaro is the place to be."}
{"text":"I think this is just a standard Korean bbq place nothing special. But they do not serve beer or wine. I was told they're in the process of obtaining a alcohol license. Overall food and service was good"}
{"text":"Price is great for dinner $20, selection of meat is good according to price and a Vegas kbbq (L.A. has much better for the same price), service is generally poor there are 2 servers that are decent the rest are garbage. The reason for the 2 stars I have been there numerous times since day 1, all of a sudden they do not allow solo diners. I went there at 1130pm and they weren't busy at all but would not seat me even though they knew I was a regular. There is a new place opening  up down the street I can't wait for them to take their business."}
{"text":"Favorite Korean bbq, quality meat you can taste, clean location and nice staff. Prepare to wait 10-20 minutes, they're always busy. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"the quality of food was blah... the service: - they won't tell you or give explanation about the price till u order n get the expensive one - the waitress rude, and give u shitty face when u ask another meat even that for the second round! u cant finish talk  about what u want about what u would like to get cause when u just tell one kind of meat she left right away ( what the!!!!) - becareful the waitress happy to argue with u, because u cant finish the meat (of course i cant finish because u gave me a big whole plate of tongue, and right away left after u gave it , i can't even tell u thats too much!!!!!) if u want get shitty service and very low quality food with a lot of msg on marinated meat except if u are their nationality, then come here!!! i would better eat grass in front my house than spend money , and time to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Came here again after a while, and Gina provided amazing service. Everyone is attentive to our table for orders, grill change, etc. I love this place and always recommend it when my friends crave kbbq!"}
{"text":"So, this place is pretty amazing. I can see why the waitlist fills up fast. COME EARLY for dinner if you want a seat fast, especially for big groups.   All the meat tasted fresh and they were quick to deliver those orders. Maybe it's cause we ordered too much at once and also because I've just started eating red meat again, but I couldn't distinguish the meat orders from each other unless it was pork vs beef vs octopus. Aside from that, they change your grill fairly often and you could request for them to do it if they happen to not see you. Dessert is also available, though it was just ice cream options.  Some personal gripes would be that they don't offer the large lettuce leaves, though they do have salad. I'm not sure how much soju is regularly at restaurants, but at 11 dollars a bottle, I do see my money quickly disappearing if I'm drinking with friends. But aside from that, not many real complaints.  The price is pretty fantastic for AYCE korean bbq, even with alcohol prices not being so agreeable. They have a large array of food options for the all day special. It's a popular establishment, so come early and bring friends!  kamsahamnida, hwaro!"}
{"text":"Fast service n good value! Come during lunch time no need to wait!   Presentation and atmosphere is relaxed and friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is the best kbbq in town, the meat is so naaaaammmmmiiittttt #delicious the servers are on point, the variety of meat is exciting...  would come back again next week... good job team for making this place +AAA"}
{"text":"So far so good just the start of the meal and  appreciating it;) I was apprehensive at first but this place has an awesome atmosphere and fun!"}
{"text":"We were curious on what this restaurant offers. It is pricey. The quality of meat is ok not the best compare to other korean/japanese buffet we tried. We were 2 and we got charged for an automatic 15% service fee which doesn't make sense. There's alot of different buffet places in the town and we wont recommend it. The aircon was not working the inside of the restaurant messy. There's no space for waiting area you have to wait outside."}
{"text":"this place is very good i enjoy the options they had to offer and the servers are fast and effective   they have great meat . and I like the sauces. and I like the vegetables also nice sides. and best of all its all you can eat for great price"}
{"text":"Ambience is pretty nice, food is great, what more can you ask for. You can tell this is a great Korean BBQ joint judging by the amount of people that come here. My party had to wait an hour and a half so the more hungry we got the better the food tastes."}
{"text":"Recommend hwaro for their quality meat and service.  Only negative is the wait takes forever!"}
{"text":"Things seem to be changing around here and I love it. I would consider myself a regular at this Korean BBQ spot. During my previous visits, service was always subpar. Our servers and the old hostess always had an attitude and never smiled or looked like they enjoyed their job for some reason. My last two visits fortunately, my boyfriend and I experienced the best experience here ever.  I spoke to the new hostess and she confirmed that there is a whole new staff! Our server lastnight, I believe his name was Ryan was very nice and welcoming. He was very open to care to our needs. Super happy with the change in staff! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Love the Korean BBQ here! The meat are definitely marinated well and it's good quality. They can get really busy though even on weeknights. It may be pricier than going to AYCE places but it's worth it. Love the ice cream sandwich dessert!"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and the food is good! This is the first place I tried Korean BBQ and I fell in love.   All the meat I tried was fresh and good quality.   There was an ice cream I had with coffee and I think like Frosted Flakes or something. Whatever it was, it was BOMB!   Usually a long wait and not a lot of parking, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Vegas. We checked out this place and Honey Pig. Hwaro had a huge line whereas Honey Pig was half empty and being 2 minutes away from each other, we figured it must be worth the wait if no one was leaving to go somewhere else. The one downside was that we waited almost 1.5 hours for a table. We noticed that seating was too efficient as there were no tables for 2 people so they took up the 4 seaters which delayed the wait. As well, they have this really long table in the middle of the restaurant which takes up a lot of space but wasn't functional.  On to the positives, the food was great. The selection was quite large (compared to Canadian KBBQ) and everything tasted great! The shake shake rice was different and tasty. The skirt steak so tender. I only wish we had more time to visit again as we weren't able to try everything on the menu.  Would definitely go back if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ definitely my favorite spot to eat so many selections. Always satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Hwaro is the best AYCE KBBQ spot to me. It's around $25 for dinner, but lunch and late night is $20. Their appetizers are included and omg!! Try The Shit(that's the name) it's the best app to me. Wait time isn't usually too long. Service is great! It's my go to spot when I'm going out"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time with the boyfriend. Honestly I really like it. I usually go to other places for kbbq. I didn't have to wait that long eventhough it was lunchtime kinda (1 pm on friday). The basic side dished are already there for you, which I really liked. The menu is amazing. They offer a lot of appetizers. The service is good, attentive. Changed the grill without even having to ask."}
{"text":"This place was way above my expectations!! I got recommended here from a friend !! Food is amazing service was great just wonderful I'm so happy I went there I will be a regular from now on"}
{"text":"Lovin' it already!! Once you go in, it smells like how a BBQ restaurant supposed to smell! Korean Style!! I'm hungry! Very hungry! And I'm gonna stuff my face right now!! As in, RIGHT NOW!!  If you are looking for budget eats with awesome quality and quantity, this is the RIGHT place!"}
{"text":"Food was great, excellent service, nice place and very relaxing. Jayden was prompt with our orders. Highly recommended and will come back again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. The staff is friendly, but as it gets busier the service slows down a lot. All in all, a great all you can eat KBBQ joint. A bigger selection of meats would have given it a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here on my best friends bday. Service is excellent and attentive even on a busy Thursday night"}
{"text":"The quality of meat and service are excellent! They have improved a lot since they opened. I stopped coming here for a while, but after finding out that they added more stuff to their menu, I came back! Definitely recommend coming here if you want AYCE Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive kbbq spot! The atmosphere is chill and cozy. Kpop music videos are playing on the tv screens located in the restaurant. I was tucked in a corner near the entrance with friends so I didn't get the chance to fully scope out the rest of the area. Overall, the food and customer service were A+! I don't have any complaints. My night was wonderful."}
{"text":"The meat is good and the price is quite descent. Just waiting a little bit long, about an hour at dinner time."}
{"text":"Worse korean bbq place. Waited for an hour even if there were at least 7 unoccupied tables. When we were finally seated the waiter took our Orders as we eat our appetizers. When we ordered steamed rice with our meat, the waiter told us that we had to wait another 3o mins since they don't have any. They should have notified everybody that were waiting to be seated about this. Of course 3omins wait time for rice was stretched to an hour. Very bad customer service. Refills came very slow to Never. The waiter even gave us empty wet plastic cups for our water. Gross. Not coming back ever."}
{"text":"This one is one of the place highly recommended by my fiancé's cousin. So, after winning a pretty good amount at the tables. Lets get a ride app to this location. Order a large bottle of Japanese beer to share and eat our weight in Korean BBQ.  One price, a-la-carte style ordering of whatever meats in their menu that you fancy. First the banchan, then comes the drinks, then comes whatever it is you ordered. 2 to 3 at a time is my rule, however many the group can handle. My favorite would probably be the pork belly and the guts. I could have those all day.   It's not a big giant place. The setting is pretty intimate, so if you're bringing a large party expect a bit of a wait. The the booths are rather intimate as well. Probably 4 people max,, and not the big girthy American size either. The place is kept very tidy and clean. The servers are on point as well. They took great care of us. Very accommodating and very intuitive,, chop sticks drop on the floor, they magically appear to bring a new set. Yea, that's what I call service!!  Thank you once again for an amazing experience Hwaro,,, next time I'm in Vegas and I'm in the mood to eat my own weight in Korean bbq,, I'll definitely pay you a visit."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I am so used to having access to yakiniku restaurants at all times of the day. So being that I have not had yakiniku for several months I was starting to get desperate to find one ASAP.Went on Yelp! and found this place was near by so I decided to give it a try. Overall a good experience. Food was good and the banchan was good as well. Customer service could have been better (our waters were never filled, never came to check on us unless we waved him down, etc.) Would this be the first place I'd recommend to people? not necessarily. BUT if you're just looking to find somewhere to \"get the job done\" then this place will do that."}
{"text":"This is honestly probably the best KBBQ I have ever had. I've been to many but this definitely tops it off. Whenever I go, there is barely a wait time. I go usually during the week but on The weekend it's pretty busy which is normal for any restaurant. When you sit at the table, they display all the side items for you before you even sit down - which is super nice. It's honestly amazing and the customer service is so great. I love coming here and I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Korean food in town and I thought this was an amazing place. Environment had a nice easy going energy. Food was outstanding and the service was great. Happy friendly staff. I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great energy, great company.  Love the Korean BBQ here!!"}
{"text":"This is our first time eating here but all I can say, their meats are so goooood! All their meats are fresh. The sides were good too, not too spicy, glad it was like that though. Servers were nice and really friendly. This is the 2nd place on my list of AYCE korean bbq restaus out here."}
{"text":"$19.99 for All You Can Eat (AYCE) Korean BBQ (KBBQ)? Hell to the yes!   This place offers quality grilled meats at a huge value! The all you can eat deal is definitely the way to go; the meal is actually a feast and comes with a few complimentary dishes, but I wouldn't sweat trying to force down everything, especially if meat is on your agenda. They also offer a good variety of traditional banchan (side dishes) that all tasted fresh and authentic. Our favorites were the kimchi and the bean sprouts - both extremely flavorful! You can also request some garlic and jalapeños to grill up! That's our favorite thing to do and pairs deliciously with grilled meat.   Of all meats we tried, I preferred the meats from the non-marinated \"plain\" section, I found them to be fresh and I loved being able to dip them in the table sauces and control my salt intake. The pre-marinated meats were a tad too salty for me. Make sure to try half-portions of the meat so that you have room to try more! Luckily my friend Philip T. gave us this tip, so we didn't have to break our bellies to try everything.   Here's what we tried:  *Pork shoulder butt - unbelievably buttery! I loved dipping this in the sesame oil salt 5/5  * Hwaru pork belly - super thin pork belly that looks like bacon! Flavor was very buttery and slightly sweet. 5/5  *Marinated pork rib - great flavor and very juicy meat, but maybe too chewy for me 3/5  *Short rib (bone) - great meaty flavor and juicy, but this one was also a tad too chewy for my preference 3/5   *Sweet spicy pork - very tender and nice sweet and spicy flavor, yet it was a little too salty for us 4/5  *Spicy baby back ribs - tender and super meaty again, slightly too salty for us 4/5  Complimentary sides: * Doenjang Jjigae (Korean fermented soybean paste stew) - traditional and very comforting! I loved sipping the hot broth 5/5  * Gyeran jjim (Korean steamed fluffy egg casserole) - super fluffy! 5/5  * Salad - simple but fresh with a tangy light dressing. Great balance to all of the meat! 4/5  * Corn cheese - A traditional bar type food, with average flavor 3/5  * Pumpkin sikhye - chilled sweet pumpkin dessert drink. It's simple, but a great palate cleanser after all of that meat! 4/5  We really adored the waitress who tended our table, cooking our meat for us; she was very friendly, helpful and informative. Plus the overall service was extremely prompt and polite from the entire staff during our dinner. Any sides or sauces we needed were refilled immediately with no down time. We also enjoyed the trendy ambiance and all of the nerdy comics and posters scattered about. We really felt that they appreciated us for dining there and that left a great first impression on us! I've only had a handful of KBBQ dining experiences in Las Vegas, but I honestly think this one has been my favorite so far! I'm already thinking about what I'm going to try the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I have been spoiled with LA's KBBQ but this place was not that great to me. All the marinated meat tasted exactly the same. They did not have rice paper or lettuce to wrap your meat with. Service was slow and the guy who was our server forgot some of the meat we ordered. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"There are plenty of Korean BBQ restaurants in Las Vegas but Hwaro is honestly the BEST!  They have a solid assortment of different meats and appetizers and their dipping sauce is awesome!  As with most Korean BBQ places they have a lunch menu that is cheaper than dinner but what makes this place great is their late night special. After 10PM you can get their lunch prices for dinner! 100 percent recommend this place to any Korean BBQ lovers!"}
{"text":"This Kbbq actually brought me back to Korea for a hot minute. The menu was awesome. So many different choices and for lunch not too bad! Only $20 per person and it's all you can eat. The side dishes were on point. The service was great. I would recommend this place to anyone. I saw the reviews and it lived up to the hype. Best Kbbq I've had in America so far!"}
{"text":"First time here and loving it so far . Food has really good flavor. I think this place is our new spot for Korean grill"}
{"text":"They re amazing. Always a wait because they're so popular. So awesome. Order the skirt steak. It's amazing"}
{"text":"Off the strip meat. I've been to a few KBBQ joints in Vegas and this one is the winner. We waited 45 minutes for a table in the LV heat but didn't care. We even came up with the 4 stages of emotions you go through during your meat filled experience.  Meat Anger Meat Sweats Meat Sweets Meat Sleeps   Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"Great food here. Definitely love the side items and appetizers but the meat selection is good too. Downside is that is in a busy plaza and parking is usually full."}
{"text":"we went for lunch, we got seated after 10 mins of waiting, nice clean place. we took the all you can eat, one of the best korean bbq place ive had in vegas so far. staff was very helpful and friendly. wide selection of meat it was delicious. will go again."}
{"text":"Wow.  Another great addition to the complex I frequent the most when I'm in the Chinatown area.  Surrounded by Monta, Raku, Zen Japanese Curry, Big Wong, the Shaved Ice place and more, all that could be asked for is an AYCE korean bbq joint. Sweet!  Parking:  The complex location is home to so many popular restaurants so while there is ample parking space, many times it will be near full.  People are coming and going all the time though so it's a just a few moments more between you and some really good food.  Food:  We tried almost all the meat selections they had and there were plenty to choose from.  Hwaro pork belly, brisket, sliced ribeye, sweet & spicy pork, boneless marinated chicken, short ribs, pork shoulder butt, pork ribs, and beef sirloin of flank with soy sauce to name most.  All those named above were very tasty.  Nothing tasted bland or dry.   Everyone in my group has their favorite but we could all agree that (surprisingly) the boneless marinated chicken was one of their best.    I didn't get to try the pork skin but the group I met up with stated they did not like it.   From what I saw of the remnants of it, they probably didn't cook it long enough to the point where it would probably be very very crispy and a more enjoyable experience to eat.   They also didn't like the tripe.  Those are more of an acquired taste I guess.  The complimentary side dishes were plentiful, tons of variety, but many I probably wouldn't care for.  Still, it is nice that they offer more options for those that enjoy each dish.  Off the top of my head, rice, bean sprouts, sliced onions, daikon radish, bean curd, some type of anchovy looking thing, kimchee, steamed egg, salad, potato salad,  jalapeno slices, garlic cloves, dried seaweed, as well as sesame oil, and some hot dipping sauces.    I came late and when I asked for a side of the cheesy creamed corn side, I was told they ran out.  Okay, when you have your grand opening in two weeks, please don't run out of food.  Or it is possible, like a reviewer below me stated that the dishes might change daily?   The steamed egg they brought me was a little overcooked on the bottom, you could taste the burntness of it.    As far as the restaurant itself, very clean.  The service was fine except for having to ask for the cheese corn side dish three separate times before they finally told us they ran out.  The only other thing I'd bring up was the table set up in the middle.  There are two tables side-by-side in the middle which can easily host a group of 8 people.  HOWEVER, only one of the connected tables has a grill.  Cooking for 8 people on one grill would be an inconvenience that I would not want to experience.  It would be better to just split your larger group into two smaller ones.  One of the managers, Jae, stated they will have their grand opening in two weeks from now.   He states they plan to change their hours to stay open until 3 A.M.    This is perfect for the late night grubbers and partiers out there.    If you like AYCE Korean BBQ for a very reasonable price of $20 for dinner and you have an appetite, definitely come here.  There was no wait for a table like you would expect at Tofu Hut down the street and the meat was in my opinion better than the latter.  Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"again - same night- trying to help out & go to a korean resturaunt... he refused to sit me down one person..  they refused to sit me down.. cause i was gonna eat by myself..  do not ever go into a korean resturant in my life in las vegas ever again..  not even 30 seconds.. they judge a woman with money wanting to eat korean food of her own kind rejects her..  i am sorry again for this review but i hope that you guys have a better experience than i have..  but never go into a place that refuse a person who is willing to pay for your food..  sometime a person who eata alone can tip you way more than you expected..  they refuse service-"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted right away. They set up our table and called us to sit right away after, which is very good and accommodating. The servers Jenna and Baek attended to us right away with drinks once we got seated down and took our order. Very fast and efficient service. Everything was delicious, from the meats to the appetizers to the side dishes. They have green tea pork belly! I'm a big fan of anything with green tea. They also have pork cheek and pork skin. I haven't eaten in a Korean bbq place with any pork skin or pork cheek before so this is a first time for me. I like their selection of meats. Will be back!"}
{"text":"After a few fails we finally found the best all you can eat Korean BBQ ! Food was tasty, portions were larger then most places, service was on point. It's a win for our family. We will be back, not going anywhere else !"}
{"text":"3/5, Location: Drove off the strip in search of a good food place to eat at that wasn't busy and had parking. Ended up in the total opposite place but it seemed busy enough we just had to try it.  5/5, Service: Coming from Hawaii, service at a yakiniku place is a hit-or-miss 50% of the time. Maybe it was luck, maybe it wasn't, but Hwaro certainly knew how to give great service despite how busy they were!  5/5, Food: Coming from Hawaii where yakiniku is a popular item for late night dinners, I came with the same expectations. I was certainly shocked that the menu was nearly 5x larger for the same price! It wasn't just random items that no one ordered either! Ordered more than I though I could handle but we ended up clearing out almost all of it because it just tasted too good to waste!  If I'm ever craving yakiniku, Hwaro is definitely a place to visit again. Sure wish we had their selection and service back home!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My go-to spot when it comes to Korean BBQ. Best green tea ice cream in town!"}
{"text":"No stars.. Big Fat 0!  I was told I couldn't eat there cause I was by myself. I can only eat there if I brought a guest. WTF!! More like the color of my skin or they thought I would've eaten more than $19.99 worth of food. I probably could've but you made a big mistake, they forgot about things like social media, Yelp for example. Big middle finger!!"}
{"text":"Great meat selection. Loved how they have your table set up with all the meal accompaniments even before they seat you. And they are not frugal in replenishing favorites -- my family's is the fish cake!  They are doing things right because when you go here for dinner expect to wait for 30min or more"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff. Nice atmosphere Gotta try the squid and belly.  KFC is really good too!"}
{"text":"This place is the amazing. Always packed for a reason! Make sure to order \"the shit\"."}
{"text":"It's almost 2 yrs since I've been back.. the price increased a little.. NOW it's $23.99 and it's worth the price. The food has improved in a good way.. thank god!!    They have so much sides,appetizer and meats to choose from and some of them are really good.  I love the galbi(flavorful and TENDER), beef bulgogi and mushroom  beef wrap is my 3 favorites.  For the sides: I really like the SHIT(it's spicy imitation  roll and deep fried w a very good dipping sauce, I enjoy the shake shake rice and fish cakes.  Tried the KFC and fried chicken is was jus Alright, need to coat it better but the sauce was good.."}
{"text":"The food and service is great! Expect a long wait because it's so popular but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Ok Im so glad we ignored the other reviews regarding service. Came here with my husband, in laws and daughter (in a wheelchair) and we had great service. Three very attentive, polite young men were constantly changing the grill, bringing more sides, drinks, meats..... this is definitely our new spot. Everything was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great selection and fun atmosphere.  I come here all the time.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ in town. I love Korean food and I never had a favorite til this spot we found. Highly recommend by me.. it's a must try! Happiest place in town"}
{"text":"One of my favorite KBBQ places! I love the unique look of the place & how nice the employees are there. They have great selections on their menu and really good appetizers as well, especially \"the shit\".   I personally like to eat a lot of marinated meets such as spicy pork bulgogi and their pineapple beef steak! Their meats just seem to have more flavor compared to other places.  Out all the times I've came here, the waiting was very short or there was a seat available immediately! The only down part about this place is that some things are limited on the menu, which is alright!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleased. 19.99 for dinner and the menu had more than the average menu for this price. In the heart of Chinatown, parking sucks but if you wait long enough you'll find a spot.   We ordered brisket, beef tongue, rib eye, short ribs, and beef belly. Plenty of sides to offer.  Wait was approximately 40 minutes for a party of 5 on a Wednesday night around 630. Gets crowded very fast!!"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat for $23 and small portions, which means you can try a LOT of things without getting full immediately. High quality food, all delicious, and you cant beat free ice cream at the end. The atmosphere is hip, young, and trendy with K-Pop music videos providing great entertainment. The decor was gorgeous too. I cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! If I can, I would have given it 10 stars!!! Need I say more? Food and customer service A++!!!"}
{"text":"I love Hwaro! I've been here in a large group, on dates, small groups, with my kids. And I've gone every time of the day.  Every time I've come here the staff is always fun and friendly.  I've never had a hint of a bad attitude, and sometimes if I'm dancing or singing to a song they will join in. (Only a couple times though) They always treat my daughter well and give her ice cream, even though she's 3 and gets to eat for free.  The food there is amazing, all the other kbbq places in Vegas are a dollar or two more, and don't have the selection that Hwaro provides. (besides Gen as they are the same price and both have large selections.) They also have the best range of appetizers you can get at a kbbq place, and they are well known for them.   For the price of the dinner and the value of the food, this place is well worth giving a try.  And it shows with how busy they are nights & weekends.  I will sit and wait for an hour after fighting people in the parking lot for a spot thats how good Hwaro is!"}
{"text":"I've had some good korean bbq before in Los Angeles, so I guess you can say I have a higher expectation when it comes to korean bbq. To start, their menu looks expansive, but once you start ordering, at least for me, there wasn't much to eat. The meat quality was really poor even in ayce standards. All the different appetizers weren't that good, and truthfully, I just stopped eating because I was afraid I might have gotten a stomach ache. If you're not doing well financially, then this place might be for you, but otherwise, I recommend staying away. Service was bad too, but they were heavily understaffed, so I'm giving them a pass there"}
{"text":"In a plaza full of delectable restaurants this is definitely the spot if you like Korean BBQ. $16.99 all you can eat lunch and $19.99 all you can eat dinner. Quite comparable to Tofu Hut but I definitely feel like I'll be returning to this place more often. The service was excellent I love that the meal came with a lot of complimentary salad, soup and side dishes. I definitely recommend the short rib and pork belly. The food is absolutely great quality and the best part is you won't leave the place smelling like smoke and BBQ !"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out again because there was a sign that said, \"under new management\". It was horrible who ever owned it before and big kudos on the new owner!  A+++ Kimchi Tofu soup(not included with all you can eat) B+ Cream Corn something  A+ Egg Soup A+++ Cold pumpkin dessert drink  Recommendation for owner: Pork belly was good and thick but if you add some GARLIC MARINADE... Winner!  Definitely one of our top 3 in Vegas compared to Rowland height, Ca Korean BBQ joints"}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told that it was going to be a 20-30 mins but we waited not even 15mins for a seat. This was our first time here and it definitely will not be our last. Jayden was awesome and so was everyone else. Very attentive with very quick service. The price for dinner is $19.99 per person and that's is a killer deal for all that you get.."}
{"text":"Hwaro has some really good bbq! The brisket, rib eye, and short ribs are delicious! I suggest coming for dinner because they have more options include in the AYCE. The price is right & the service is good, our food came out at reasonable time. The atmosphere is upbeat. The music is really loud which causes everyone to yell in order to keep conversations. It's our spot for AYCE!"}
{"text":"The best kbbq I've had so far. It has a lot of selection including unlimited appetizers. Their bean paste soup is amazing and an appetizer called \"The Shit\" is a must. The meat had better quality than most other kbbq places and it is only $19.99"}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat Korean BBQ! I lived in Korea for over two years, I know good Korean food. Visiting from out of town and had a craving. Found this place and it was definitely the right choice. They have all the standard menu items, plus some AMAZING items I have never seen before (green tea pork belly, bulkogi nacho, spicy pineapple beef steak, etc.). Check the menu. There are tons of awesome premium items that come as part of the all you can eat. The meat is top quality and did not disappoint. Every item I tried was above average compared to other kogi buffets I've tried."}
{"text":"Keeps getting better every time! Literally found myself eating here consecutive nights on the weekend.  Sliced ribeye and brisket all day, you can't go wrong. Add in a couple orders of 'the shit' and you're good for the night."}
{"text":"My BF and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience here!! Great late night AYCE deal and fast and friendly service. Thank you Jitto and Harland for your friendly faces and wonderful service! You guys definitely made our experience that much better! I highly recommend Hwaro! Go there!!!"}
{"text":"super good service!! i love it this restaurant its super nice and the food is great. the staff is nice. they have alot of selections. the food is amazing i come here all the time and i love this place."}
{"text":"Great place good quality love the staff !! They only do walk ins and its busy all day so make sure u come prepared to wait but most of the time they seat u earlier than the quite time they give u will come back again !!!"}
{"text":"One of the best KBBQ in town. Try their \"red wine pork belly\", the meat was melting in my mouth"}
{"text":"Wow I love the chain of restaurants that the owners of this place has. Between sushi neko and here I can't go wrong for a lunch or dinner option. My boyfriend and I tried the All Day Special and it was totally worth it! We had the baby octopus and the enoki wrapped beef. Truly everything was so amazing. As well as top quality service. I can't wait to have my parents and brother try this place too. But eyes and stomach beware. Definitely order in portions because you want to try all the yummy food. Only downside is parking sucks. We parked somewhere else and walked over."}
{"text":"They make no reservations which is sucks! So I'll give two stars with that. But other than that it's good :)"}
{"text":"I ended up here accidentally when we couldn't decide where to eat in Seoul Plaza. My first time here - my husband and I were completely overwhelmed by the size of the meat portions and should have read Philip's review about doing 1/2 orders. 2nd time here - I went with 4 other people and we demolished the food thanks to some seasoned LA KBBQ fans. 3rd time here - there were 3 of us with one grill and things weren't so hectic since we made thoughtful decisions of what to get. I think one of my favorite items they serve here is the salad, which is part of the banchan that greets you at your table when you are seated. It pairs well with the meat or can be eaten alone. I think the key to eating here is getting your grill very hot before putting anything on it and asking for some raw garlic to cook along with your meat (I also just love roasted garlic in general and can eat it on it's own). The pork belly is extra thick (I didn't realize they have a thinner sized portion until reading some yelp reviews), but can be delicious if cooked with patience and you let the fat really render. Some of the other meats I have gotten here and enjoyed were the rib eye, short ribs and pork bulgogi. The pork brisket might also be a crowd pleaser/easy to cook, but I don't think it particularly stands out. I like the dipping sauces they give - one is spicier while the other is sesame oil with salt (which I what I use when making KBBQ at home). I'm okay with the $19.99 price tag since the servers are quick and coming here for my is relatively painless. There are curiously a lot of tables here with no grills and no vents, which I've only seen people use while they wait, so maybe it's for lunch time goers who don't do AYCE? You can also end your meal with a scoop of ice cream. The choices offered to us were red bean, green tea and one other one I couldn't remember the name of. They are open very late and have clear last call signage (unlike Gen Korean BBQ... tsk tsk)."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant! I prefer this to Gen or Tofu Hut. I recommend the red wine and green tea pork belly, brisket, bulgogi, squid, baby octopus, sliced ribeye, skirt steak, green mussels, and spicy pineapple steak! \"The Shit\" appetizer is great too, it's similar to an appetizer by the same name I've had at sushi restaurants like Sakana. The affogato dessert (sweet coffee and ice cream) is amazing too! That's the first time I've had it with corn flakes and it seemed strange at first but it added a nice crunch. There's still quite a few items on the menu I've yet to try but I'd like to during my next visit."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Always come here for great selection of food!  High quality meats and still for a great price. Can't go wrong!   Parking is tight so come earlier in the day and you should be good."}
{"text":"Place has great side and plenty choices of meat! And the appetizers are the bomb dot com! Good to come in the afternoon, dinner gets cray busy"}
{"text":"This place is not worth going too! My first time here was a bad experience. This restaurant was so dirty I couldn't even eat and service was so poor. It seems like the staffs don't care at all. I just can't believe this place is rated 4 star wow!"}
{"text":"This is my first Korean BBQ and Gaeun was really helpful and nice with suggestions, and the food was awesome. The 20 all you can eat is a great deal . Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is very roomy for big parties and a nice place if you are in the mood for AYCE KBBQ!"}
{"text":"Great food! There are too many people waiting on Saturday night but this is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great environment, great staff, and great food! Wish there was better parking. You gotta order The Shit..it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean yakiniku for $20.95. There's late night special for $17.95 but it doesn't include all the items. We really enjoyed some of the sides like the daikon , steamed egg, and the shit. We ordered the shake shake rice, nothing really special since it's just like kimchi and rice. Overall, price is really cheap for all the food you can get. The grill takes awhile to char the meat. They don't have shrimp or other seafood options that most yakiniku places have though (except squid and octopus, octopus being really good surprisingly!). I'm assuming the older lady walking around that also finalized the bill is the boss lady? Well she shows no emotion and does not even respond when you tell her thanks so it can get awkward with her. Otherwise would come again to try other items!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite kbbq place ever. The price are not very expensive and the meat are fresh. It would be much better if you guys would have more desert to choose from and I'll come back next time ."}
{"text":"Came here after a 8 mile hike and a 2 hour drive, so we were ready to eat! We waited about a hour for 3 people. It's a very popular place so we expected a wait. They have a huge menu of meats and appetizers and they give you 90 mins to stuff yourself, just don't leave too many left overs or they will charge you extra. We got so many different types of meat but my favorite was the premium steak which is pretty much a whole ribeye, galbi (short ribs) and the skirt steak. The quality of meat was great for a AYCE spot. Service was on point. Will def stop by the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Still as good as I remember. Good service good food good value and the wait isn't as scary as the crowded parking lot hints at"}
{"text":"Great portions.  Worth the price.  Good quality meat.  Kind servers. Love the Affogato dessert. Ordered: Bulgogi Nacho-need a bit more meat hahah. Brisket, Pork Belly, sliced Rib Eye, Baby Octopus, Short ribs, Spicy Pineapple Beef.  Bean Paste Soup-Perfect! A bit spicy which I like and maintains its hot temperature, I guess cos it's in a good pot.  I suggest adding Filet mignon or other steaks on the menu.  Wish we can have more than one order per person of dessert."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because Hwaro has really up'd their quality and service! The server, Jitto, is my favorite. He's always running around the entire restaurant taking care of everybody with a smile on his face. The sauces are delicious and it's nice because they just give you a bottle of it. The meats aren't nearly as fatty as a majority of the competing joints. Their gyoza is so delicious, and their kimchi is fresh. I used to strictly go to Gen, but Hwaro's quality and taste is better! I normally always take advantage of the late night special since I get off work late. It's pretty bad how much I come here now; I think at least once a week.  it's amazing, though! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, nothing spectacular and the price was reasonable.  The service was not good.  We walked in and the lady told us to wait.   There was no warm greeting or anything which is fine if the rest of the experience was great.  It was not. The fire kept going out in our burner and every time we asked for help they seemed annoyed.  This was true with everything else.  We had to constantly ask for side dishes, etc.  It was a bit stressful.  I can go to another bbq place with better service."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean BBQ place. Large servings, their banchan selection is good, great and prompt service."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place for AYCE is that they offer a huge variety of meats, more than just the basics. They offer a variety of appetizers too like \"the shit\" (sushi deep fried roll,not bad) . Just make sure you anticipate a wait for a table at night. And, parking is insane so definitely car pool or have someone jump out and reserve a table for your party. Overall great price!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for KBBQ. This place is really great~! Definitely recommend for you guys to try it! Great service!!"}
{"text":"Before coming here I had no experience with Korean BBQ. I only ever heard of it, saw pics on Instagram or got the glimpses from my favorite k dramas. Lol back to the review... anyway our waiter was SUPER informative about the menu & how many servings we could get & what not. I wish I got his name because he's the reason my experience was so great! The only thing I would say is I wish he mentioned we could order half portions before the end of our meal. But besides that, amazing service & great food!!"}
{"text":"its very small which is nice. Friendly workers. Janice is really nice and very attentive to our table. This place is nice and very reasonable. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! So good. AYCE (all you can eat) Korean BBQ with sides. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for dinner and I definitely recommend this place, the food it's great. The only thing We didn't like it was the long wait, but overall it's worthed."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas local and i LOVE this spot to eat! Top three in my list! You want all you can eat BEEF? Come to Hwaro! And visit Jitto! He is the best server there and will make you feel like a king! Best service and fantastic food! You can't get better than this...."}
{"text":"Love this place! You have to try the shit!  Small place always packed, free soda if you post a review!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite KBBQ spot. Meat is good as well as the sides. Service can be a little bit of a hit and miss, but usually it's pretty good. There are certain servers here that are absolutely fantastic while the others are not as attentive, so to say."}
{"text":"That's it.  We're moving to Vegas cus we found out best Korean AYCE. The food was delicious and the options you had was way better than gen. We will be coming back just to eat here."}
{"text":"I really like the service and the great quality of the food for the pricing. The server is constantly looking and making sure we are helped which helps a lot and they have not taken more than 5 min to bring something out. I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten ten times better since the last time I was there which was maybe two years ago (I'm from Arizona) I loved the beef belly and spicy pork!!!!! Actually all the meats were great! They added a bunch of sides like cheesy cream corn! Great and fast service! Did not have to ask for s grill change and our service always came by to check up on us. My friends seriously can't stop raving about this place!!! Can't wait to return to Vegas !"}
{"text":"very delicious and open late too!!!! highly recommend trying the spicy bulgogi i never find it at any other place  and they have lots of other specials too"}
{"text":"Good place to eat, very affordable and delicious  Open until 3am. The service is good and the restaurant is clean. They have lots of food choices! Surely recommended"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in the valley, great choices of meat and appetizers , love their sauces, long wait but worth it!! A lot of people come here."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ ever. Reasonable price. Nice service. Good location. Many different kind or dishes and meat."}
{"text":"Dropped in for their $19.99 AYCE dinner.   Service was quick as they kept replenishing the meats.  Don't really have any complaints about the meats - The kal bi - short ribs were delicious.  The Hwa Ro pork belly is sliced paper thin.   It was alright.  Give me the regular pork belly so i can get the thickness.  Pork skin was decent - cook it longer so it can get a little more texture and crisp-ness.    As for everything else, I thought the ban chan was sub par.   The cheesy corn i'm not sure i get.  I like my noodles/rice al dente but the korean rice cakes were extremely hard to eat.  For a $20 price tag you cant go wrong.   I'm not sure if this is a promo rate.  I won' go out of my way but will join if others are going - I d rather pay more and go down the street to Lee's.  Yes i'll take worse service (who cares - it's asian) to get better ban chan and a better AYCE even if it is a little more.    But for a $20 deal, this is pretty decent - the place is really clean and modeled nicely."}
{"text":"I came here late November during lunch hour. For those of you who don't know how Korean BBQ works, there is a fire pit grill in the middle of your table and you cook the raw meats you order yourself on the fire pit. The simplicity of the menu makes it easy to choose what to get; options range from pork, chicken, and beef cuts of meat to seafood and vegetables at Hwaro. There are also a la carte options you can order, all of which are included in the All-you-can-eat deal (some  items might be limited, however).  My party of four all had the All-you-can-eat Lunch Speacial. We had a taste of about half of the meats on the menu. We had two types of chicken, octopus, brisket, \"the Shit\" (Yes, that's what it's called), and another type of beef. All were delicious and tasted as expected.  We also had dessert. Green tea ice cream was our selection and it was vibrant with the taste of matcha; a must!  The waiter was quick to change our fire pit whenever it got too black, which happened about three times. One thing I did not necessarily enjoy would be the rate at which our dishes were cleared. I get that some places wait until the meal is over to clear the dishes, but with four people at a table, with our place settings fitting tightly, clearing our dishes more often would have things more comfortable for us. It was also inconvenient to have to pour our own water from a water bottle; with four people, the water goes fast and having to constantly ask for more water becomes a chore. In addition to this, not having a staple of rice from the beginning was a little disappointing. How can you eat Asian food without rice? We were able to order rice, but it should have been a clear option from the start.  All-you-can-eat lunch and dinner are reasonably priced. However, whenever I hear \"All you can eat\", the impression I get would be to eat food as much as possible until I have been satisfied with what I have consumed. During my visit, I felt as if they waiters did not want us to order after the second round of ordering meats. The brisket and chicken are pretty light and sharing the portions of meat with your party makes each order go fast.  I would not mind coming back here if invited, but I did not feel as if I got my money's worth. Korean BBQ is great, but make sure you get the value of your dining experience as advertised."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. Mmmmmm! Get there early coz it is busy and the wait can be a bit long for big crowds or groups. Very nice decorations too."}
{"text":"Totally recommend good service and is all u can eat I came twice already I just would prefer they have more Options on deserts menu and drinks  Good food"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome, but it's went way downhill. Their banchan used to be great, but that's changed. Hint: the potato doesn't need giant chunks of onion, the pickled jalapeño and radish didn't need the onion or sickly sweet taste either, and the pickled onions are very missed. I will say the cucumbers are a welcome addition. The brisket is now consistently extremely fatty and tough, and the service is totally hit or miss. Please change your banchan back. I'm so disappointed with my recent experience with Hwaro. The food was good before."}
{"text":"I was surprised that they allowed me to dine in here solo on one occasion. Most places require a party of 2 or more in order to start the grill for you. $16.99 for AYCE lunch is a steal for the quality of the meats, side orders, and service.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few months ago and I do frequently go to a lot of Korean BBQ places in Los Angeles and this one is definitely in the top 5 of my fav Korean BBQ places. Very fairly priced!!!!!! I think 20.95 for all you can eat is a perfect deal, I will continue to come back for more bomb food the next time I come to Vegas"}
{"text":"I had high hopes about this place, but at the end I was pretty disappointed and knew I should of trust my instincts and left as soon as I saw one of the servers touched her nose and mouth!   First it's pretty disappointing when you walk In and not know how long you'll be waiting for a table, lack of communication.  Second it's an eye sore having to see part of the kitchen and looking at how the servers handle your food. Touching their nose and mouth then your food! Ahhh!! l was pretty disgusted how they serve water. They pour water with a red bucket into these pitchers. I just sticked to can soda. THIS PLACE HAD POOR STANDARDS OF FOOD HYGIENE.   Our server did not really communicate with us. Yeah it had a cute atmosphere but the food lacked in flavor, our table was greasy, menu was sticky, plastic cups were not dry. Awful just awful. I WILL STICK TO TOFU HUT."}
{"text":"Hwaro is my favorite Korean Barbecue restaurant in Vegas. The wait is long but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I went here back in October 2017. It was fantastic. An all you can eat extravaganza. My mom, her husband and my brother never had Yakiniku before and this was a fantastic restaurant to take them to.   Everything on the menu was on the board with 1 hour. My family loves gyoza so we ordered so many rounds of gyoza it was crazy. The staff is super friendly and it was really enjoyable.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great went there last week on sat night... me and wifey wait an hour but is worth the wait the food and quality of meat selection is great..I know why I don't give 5 stars the only reason is the service kind slow."}
{"text":"Probably the best kbbq I've ever had, and for only $22 unlimited orders?! This place was packed around 5:30pm and it's well deserved. The meats are all pretty high quality and the service is on point. Notable apps include the Shake Shake Rice and egg custard, and I also liked the affogato at the end."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ open till 3 am. It does exits! Food was really good. Everything was flavorful and they have a good amount of items you don't have to cook yourself."}
{"text":"Love the free drink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, i really enjoy the free drink, really like the free drink"}
{"text":"I have only been to one other Korean BBQ place and this one was better then the last. When you date a asian girl you go to places like this (basically every type of asian food ever you will try once) it was really good and my chop stick game is getting serious now after 10 months of practice lol.. People are friendly and the Korean girl band music in the background is a nice touch lol"}
{"text":"If you're on the strip  and looking for a huge meal to eat I suggest avoiding the buffets and heading to Hwaro. Seriously, once we stopped looking at JUST the strip district options, our dining experiences got far more varied and we enjoyed ourselves much more. This is not to knock some of the great restaurants on the strip but it's definitely worth it to check out Hwaro and get a better feel for the variety of dining in the whole area. The price of the all-you-can-eat Korean bbq for dinner was in the low twenties and everything we tried was absolutely fantastic. Make sure to factor in an hour or so to wait during evenings if you're not able to get there during off times since they definitely don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Always love coming here. The service is very attentive and the meat quality is pretty good for how much it cost per person. If you want to get a seat right away, it's best to go there before 7pm. Anytime after that, the wait time increases pretty fast."}
{"text":"Waiting 45mins to only be skipped because we were waiting outside and none of the employees had the common sense to check with the people waiting directly in front of their establishment.  We forgave them and decided to wait inside for another 10mins for them to give our table to another skipped party who left and missed their turn, but decided to come back..!  All the employees look miserable and give a very negative vibe. I'm used to bad service from Korean establishments, but this was just pure negligence!"}
{"text":"The best kbbq place of las vegas, food is sooo delectable i like their sauce the bolgogi nacho is my favorite. They have friendly and nice staff! I recommend this place if you are looking for a kbbq place."}
{"text":"Best AYCE KBBQ I have ever had. The meat is stupid fresh and the sides are always delicious. I visit at least one to two times a week. Addicted"}
{"text":"My go to ayce kbbq spot! Awesome late night special for those post workout protein and carb recharges!"}
{"text":"We tried to go to Tofu Hut first, but did not want to wait that long to eat, so we decided to try Hwaro instead.  I came here on a Saturday night around 11pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  We chose the AYCE option for $16.99 - what a great deal!  They had a variety of choices to choose from, we tried the normal beef brisket, pork belly, spicy pork belly, a few of the marinated meats.  The service was pretty good.  We also ordered the tofu soup, which if I could redo that... I would stick with the meat instead.  You can still order the bean paste soup and steamed egg that comes with it, so it was pretty good deal! I'll probably be back here next time I'm in Vegas craving some Korean bbq."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and it did not disappoint. So many different types of meat to choose from and for the most part they were all really good. They even offer appetizers and some soups as part of the ayce. What really caught my eye was the included affogato for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good time here! Just be prepared to wait, though, most evenings. The price for $21 for AYCE at night is great. The selection is good, and so is the customer service!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Best fishcake ever!!!\" Well, they had the best fishcake I've ever tasted. My dad even said so! The server from Korea said Korea has better, but this is the best I've ever tried.   Anyway, they're pretty much always busy. I've only been there twice, but both times it was pretty packed. The first time we went we waited about 20-30 minutes to get a table. Luckily, the second time we went I think we only waited about 10-15 minutes.   The meat is awesome. I've been to some AYCE Korean BBQ where the meat was too thin. The meat here is just right. I love that they have beef tongue. My husband loved the brisket. My dad loved the chicken bulgogi.   The banchan is awesome! My faves were definitely the fishcake, but also the potato salad and I think pickled daikon? But yeah... the fishcake!  I liked the taste of their salad thingy too. Really yummy with the meat dipped in sesame oil w/ salt & pepper.  A couple we sat by recommended we try \"The Shit\". It's deep fried something delicious with a dip that's a little spicy but good. You can only get one order per person if that.   At the end of our meal we got the coffee ice cream that the couple recommended to us too. It was AWESOME! It's ice cream with Korean coffee poured over it and cereal sprinkled on the top.   It's only $22.95 and an awesome deal in my opinion. We went to a few different AYCE Korean BBQ places around Vegas and I think this one was the best."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our AYCE experience here. For $22.95 you get a wide variety of choices. They keep the portions small so you can try several different dishes (except for the premium steak which is pretty big). Some dishes are allowed one per table and some are allowed one per person. However, most choices are unlimited.   They highly recommend the skirt steak but it's nothing special. The meat was a bit tough and chewy compared to other skirt steak I've had at other Korean restaurants. The vibe inside the restaurant is cool but the music could be considered a bit loud for some. But we didn't mind at all. Be prepared to wait a while especially on weekends or holidays. Overall a good experience. I would come back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty great and prices are awesome but the service is definitely lacking. Servers take there time to get to you and do not typically prebuss your table"}
{"text":"My sis and her family were here for a short visit.  After our day at Hoover Dam we all voted on Korean cuisine.  It was a good opp to introduce my nephew to new flavors.  The decor and larger tables are set up pretty invitingly.  We were led to the sort of upper level seating booth.  Watch your step especially if you've had adult drinks ;)  An observation I made was there aren't as many small plates given here than at other Korean dining locations.  Also their AYCE isn't really all you can eat.  Certain items on their menu are limited to one per person.  That's not the AYCE concept.  They will charge you $3.99 to take anything home.  Why? We aren't wasting it.  You're just gonna toss it which technically costs more money for the business to waste.  Its not like we didn't finish our rice and you charge us for that (like at sushi restaurants).  Twisted...  Service was good not super great.  I'll leave this a neutral, but will definitely bring our Korean appetite cravings elsewhere to other plentiful restaurants here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just came to Hwaro to try their food, after many rave reviews from a friend.  When I walked in, I told them a table for one...they immediately dismissed me saying that they have a minimum of 2 people.  I did not see that anywhere.  I will be telling everyone I know to not come here."}
{"text":"This place is always great, awesome food , excellent staff, and the quality that you get for the price is un matched here in Las Vegas . Hands down best AYCE Korean in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy this afternoon.  We opted for their $17.95 option ($20.95 option includes short ribs and a few more items)  They have a pretty vast menu that includes appetizers such as fried chicken, an item called \"the shit\" which was basically spicy tuna and imitation crab wrapped in seaweed and deep fried, bulgogi nachos (not very good), steamed egg, bean paste soup, and more, which were all included in the ayce deal.   I enjoyed their standard pork belly and the grean-tea flavored pork belly the most, and everything else was pretty ordinary.   Ample number of side dishes. I also liked the dressing on the salad.   The servers were very accommodating to us considering we asked for a lot of things.   Oh and I almost forgot, they also provide one order of ice cream per person for dessert (green tea or affogado). That pretty much propelled this place from 3.5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is never make me disappointed. We order the same menu that we usually have which are beef frank, beef tougue and pork belly. But we try your spick pork. It kind of salty. And taco is also salty. Other things was great."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  We came with our family to try it and they said it would be a two hour wait...but the place was 1/2 empty.  Lol."}
{"text":"Most tasty Korean BBQ house in town , highly recommended. Just be patient for the long waiting list , but the delicious food really worth the waiting"}
{"text":"We were driving home from Zion, Utah & was starving from all the hiking! It was a Sunday night around 7/8pm and the wait was an hour :( it seem to be very popular, because there's not a lot of ayce in Vegas. We got seated& our waiter was very prompt with everything. I LOVE the menu, it had such a wide variety of items & items you usually don't see on ayce Korean BBQ menus. Such as ; corn cheese, gyoza, seaweed, buglogi nachos. They even had different types of sauces, soup & garlic butter! Everything was good, including the sides. It was $21 for dinner & I would definitely come back here if I'm in the area. Wished they would open one up here in California!!"}
{"text":"Overall, a decent experience. This was mine and my girlfriend's first time at a Korean bbq. We waited approximately 35 minutes. I gather that there's normally a long wait here. After being seated, we met our server. He asked if it was our first time and we told him that it was. However, he did not help us AT ALL. He didn't tell us anything and walked away. Then, he came back and started recommending very specific items on the menu as if it was clockwork. He didn't give us time to check out the menu.   Ultimately the food was on par. We figured out what to do and we were pretty full. My girlfriend and I did feel very rushed and as if we didn't learn anything. If we went back, we wouldn't know the ropes or what items were what.   I was getting ready to check out so I requested the check, yet we had some spicy chicken left to cook. I did this solely for the sake of timing. I put the chicken on the grill and then he abruptly left and it seemed as if our server was in a rush. We came to find out that he turned off the gas line to our grill, so we couldn't cook our food, and then gave us our check. So we had raw chicken on the grill (which we were saving for last) and I had to pay.    Honestly, it was just a bummer that we explained to our server that we were new and he didn't help us at all. He told us \"good luck,\" then came back later with our food. It seemed pretty sarcastic. Again, the food was on par; nothing special. I will likely try another place next time because this was not a wholesome experience. I feel as if giving them 3 stars is wrong, but I want to give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was great but the service was even better the staff was amazing. very attentive and sweet. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love eating here, the service is great, and the ambiance is even better! We love cooking our own food to our liking, and it's reasonably priced! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys ayce fans out there!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with great ambience. Waiters are attentive and courteous. Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Waiting to try the tofu, hoping it is good. Great salad dressing. The atmosphere is nice and so is the seating."}
{"text":"this was my first time having kbbq in vegas. the wait was really long, it's cause they don't have too many tables and they don't allow anyone to sit in the center of the restaurant :/ i didn't like their side dishes too much. we did get a complimentary kimchi soup with some tofu bits and the fluffy steamed egg pudding! but the items on the kbbq menu were delicious! my boyfriend and i tried the short ribs, marinated chicken, pork belly, squid, and the fat ass (yes that's one of their item names). and we liked fat ass the most! haha. the waiters were really nice. we were really full and ended up having really had food coma afterwards haha.  notes: don't come here if you're already starving because there might be a long wait! (that was my mistake) order the fat ass, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"So let me just start off by saying that this is one of my favorite places to go in Vegas. For the quality of food and the price is very reasonable. I come here with my girls almost every week. Every time I come we have to wait about an hour which is pretty reasonable. Service is eh nothing special up to this point but I do see new faces. My server today, Gaeun, she was great! I came here with my best friends and she took care of us so well. It's so rare to find quality customer service but her service was top notch. As for food if you don't know what you think as her she will give you her honest opinion! Whoop Whoop! But food is great as usual I love their brisket and spicy pineapple beef steak! Only 20.95 per person and you get EVERYTHING on the menu. I most definitely will be hitting this place up again soon!"}
{"text":"Overall can't really complain for $20 I would say best value of any Korean BBQ place in town. I like GEN out in Henderson, Utah (I'm joking) the best out at galleria mall but for in town so far it's 300% better than Sura and I guess better value than tofu hut although I still like tofu hut. My friend vic suggested it and vics opinion to me is better than Michelin or zagat ratings"}
{"text":"Amazing food. One of the best Korean spots in Vegas . Have always come here after the first time very happy with service and everything"}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriends birthday and the only complaint was the wait. There was only 3 of us and we waited well over an hour. But the service and the food were excellent!"}
{"text":"Been coming here more often, I might go more than once a week now!  The spicy pork and short rib are so good,  I can't get enough. People are so nice whenever I drop by!  Keep up to good work guys!"}
{"text":"All you can eat barbecue never disappoints. Hwaro has a great BBQ selection and super quick service! Did I mention they have corn cheese!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dining experience here. Great service, and food. I was pleased to find that they have rice paper here which is actually really hard to find at a kbbq place here in vegas. Enjoyed all the meats we got as well as the affogato dessert. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot and doesn't break the bank and he quality of the food is always good."}
{"text":"Hwaro is a great restaurant. The meat is fresh and I love the sides. It opens pretty late. So a Great restaurant for late night. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to a Korean BBQ while in Las Vegas and chose Hwaro because of the reviews. I have to say, I was not disappointed. A couple of things I saw on other reviews: 1) we parked on the street because there was no parking available in the lot and 2) there was a long wait for others but luckily we were a small group and got in right before it picked up.   Okay, back to the rating! I haven't had much Korean BBQ, but I loved this place. The meat was flavorful and the staff was attentive. We were served right away, and the staff came back about every 5-10 minutes to see if we needed anything. You can definitely eat to your hearts content here! It was $22 per person for dinner which was a great deal for the service and food we got. Not only is meat included in the $22, but also appetizers and dessert. The only extras you pay for are drinks (besides water)."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try, it was pretty good! Service was great! Was very attentive to us, switched out our grills a few times. Glad they  offer appetizers and dessert, my only complaint is that the meat sometimes feel fatty but everything else was"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food, one of the best Korean BBQ I have been to. Staff are super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite all you can eat late night Korean BBQ in town. Great service and meet quality. Definitely recommend this to everyone that ate meat lovers !!"}
{"text":"Awsome little place in Chinatown in the same plaza as curry zen, monta, and raku. They're menu is pretty big for an affordable price so it's awsome! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had no idea what to expect and it was definitely a learning experience but so great! -1 star for the wait - 1 hr but it was on Memorial Day. ?"}
{"text":"Best quality in Vegas! Especially for the price and what you get. Variety of meat is on point!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and the place is very good. Generous portion of tasty meat! The meat is fresh and juicy. There are various sides and appetizers. My favorite is the beef tongue."}
{"text":"I'm am all for kbbq and all the freshest ingredients. This, compared to others is more neighborly and accessible anytime until 2am....I do wish they have more tables, which were available but were not set up for the bbq grill--having left this one star off. The service is good and efficient. I love their pork spareribs and ribeye and squid!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated our little sisters Birthday here with family. Our first time we were told they had the best sides ever and boy were they right. Service was great! People also having dinner were all just normal people enjoying some Korean BBQ. We had such a great time we will be going back. Everything was delicious. This place is hidden but if you like good eats you will at least come and see for yourself. This is now our new hot spot!! (Korean Voice) Fighting!"}
{"text":"Hwaro used to be a favorite of mine for ayce k-bbq. I haven't gone in a while because I tried not to do ayce too much. I went yesterday for lunch because I was craving k-bbq and was curious to see if Hwaro is still good. Sadly, the quality has gone downhill here. I did the all day special for $23, which basically included every meats offered on the menu. The only good meats were the pork cheek, squid, and baby octopus. Brisket was too fatty. Tongue was too chewy. The prime steak, which is supposed to be the best and hence, is limited to one per person, was tough as heck. The skirt steak was better than the prime steak. Steamed egg was good, but bean paste soup was flavorless. Green tea ice cream tasted like vanilla ice cream. Service was ok; better than average Asian restaurants. Overall, I left feeling very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Korean BBQ!!! I have been to many in the valley but this one is priced great, service is great, and so many different options on the AYCE!! They have a ribeye on the all you can eat. Also try the appetizer \"the sh*t\". It's so good. Anyway this is highly rated place and it lived up to it."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this used to be my GO TO spot for Korean BBQ all you can eat but they turned me AWAY today at 2:45pm because of a policy that solo foodies are no longer welcome. I was about to pay for 2 just so I can eat but changed my mind after this severe injustice. 2 small tables were available and no line waiting for a table. Hwaro u left a bad taste in my mouth after this and I used to come literally 2x a week. Smh"}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing! But first....the worst part...the parking!!! There's too many great restaurants in this plaza so give yourself plenty of time to find parking as well as wait time since it's a first come basis. Price is reasonable for an ayce bbq but the part that puts them over the top, the extras on the menu. Not only do you get the meats n the Korean side dishes, you get kfc (Korean fried chicken), there cheese fondue, shake shake box( rice,Kim chee, egg) soup, and so much more. They also have rice paper that I notice only Gen would have. The staff is amazing and quick with everything, very friendly.   So the reason I only gave 3 stars...we had to wait an hour half. I'm ok with that and that's normal on a busy night but I wasn't able to purchase soju while I wait!!! I always do this when I know the wait will be long. They don't allow it. Secondly (the main reason) while I was waiting I tragically witnessed the most disgusting way the staff cleans the tables. They used a dirty rag to wipe off the old food that was pulled out from his apron. And the another dirty rag to wipe the table again. Thank gosh I carry wet wipes with me to rewipe our table. Ok maybe that part was the worst part about this review."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ place ever. Food and service is top of the line! Highly recommend without a doubt..."}
{"text":"I've been very loyal to tofu hut for years! but then HWARO caught my heart even more! first thing I love is the PRICE! beaucoup meat options.. I normally go to LEE's Kbbq for their pork bung/pork intestines, but then HWARO offers beef belly, pork intestines, etc... their APPETIZERS are LIT! don't forget to try \"THE SHIT' , steamed egg, the shake shake rice, bulgogi nacho, egg roll , gyoza, corn cheese, and they also have DESSERTS!  affogato is the best ... I love trying all kbbq's in town and so far this is the best one when you talked about price and quality.. super worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Highly recommend this place. Recommend the brisket, short rib. They got all types of meat. The environment is clean and great vibes. Better than most restaurants in china town"}
{"text":"For the \"safer\" staples like the short ribs, brisket,\"Korean Fried Chicken\" and kim-chi to out-of-the-usual like baby octopus, whole squid, seaweed salad and The Shit (chopped tuna and salmon, wrapped in nori and fried like an egg roll) we were very pleased with our first visit to Hwaro. The main BBQ food, appetizers and sides largely all were very pleasing -- except for the potato salad. But the prompt and friendly service made the 90-minute limit on the All You Can Eat dinner work out perfectly."}
{"text":"It was loud... dance music was playing like I was at EDC, on top of people noise, exhaust fans and sizzling BBQ. Maybe the purpose was to drawn that noise. Our table couldn't hear each other talk. We even had to ask for the music to be turned down a little. They did and a few minutes later, it was up loud again. We stopped talking, finished our food and left. The food was so so, nothing to brag about. I'd rather pay a little more and enjoy the meal and converse with my friends in much civilized atmosphere. Maybe the Purpose of the loud music is to get rid of people quickly... due to the long line outside."}
{"text":"I don't know why I love this place so much, lol. It's my go-to KBBQ spot. Service is a little slow though, but I like this place better than Sura and others. One time I went there two days in a row, 'coz I'm fat like that.. and the guy recognized me and started laughing with his co-worker and saying something in Korean (which were probably along the lines like, \"DAMN Look at this fatass,\") really obvious. I'll bring my Google Translate next time. Look Mr Judgey-Mcjudger.. don't judge me. I should take a star out 'coz I felt uncomfortable for a total of 3 minutes. Then i stuffed my mouth with beef again and forgot all about it."}
{"text":"Aside from the wait time which is kind of expected especially for the price and what they offer, this place was pretty good. Our waiter was very nice and she kept coming in to check up on us and change our grill cover. I enjoyed the meat without the sauces which were supposed to make them spicy. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend them if you have at least 45 mins to wait."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! definitely ayce! my baby love found this place on our trip to vegas it is off the strip and he absolutely loved the quality of the meat he tried \"the shit\" and loved it spicy tuna deep fried quite delicious."}
{"text":"The food is hella good! I am from San Francisco and my first time here, was good! Food was amazing and the service was fast! Only thing sucks was the wait because it's a popular place!"}
{"text":"Promo service and the host made sure we were seated right away! Water and sides were already prepared for us before we were seated. The late night special is one to take advantage of, especially since there is a variety of options on the menu ranging from beef belly, pork skin, etc."}
{"text":"I must admit, I love this place.  **The bulgogi is the only thing that's important to life.  **I have to subtract a star, because their steamed egg is not the best I've had.  **The portion size for my table of 4 took time to getting adjusted to.  **Didn't like the lack of space I was provided for my table as plates were piling up from small portions.  Recommendations: Portion control (more food on plate for bigger group), work on the steamed egg, keep up the great work on the product you offer."}
{"text":"I never realized this place until a friend told me about it recently.  Its located next to Monta Ramen and Kungfu Tea in a busy plaza as it is. The price is reasonable for all you can eat (acye). Both the quality of food and speed of service was exceptional.  I'm glad I got a chance to try this place out."}
{"text":"Man this place just blew us away .. This is gonna be out new spot staff is very helpful had a blast here today with my wife .. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Go to Gangnum Asian Korean BBQ instead. All I know is we went and stood in the doorway next to the wait to be seated sign for 15 minutes. Plenty of servers and employees saw us, but not one of them acknowledged us. It wasn't very busy. Just when we were about to inquire, two people walked in behind us, went over to the register and signed their name on a clipboard and were immediately sat. I asked the lady if we needed to sign in because we had been waiting, and she said yeah and walked away. I then walked out the door. Customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. And the place looked a bit dirty."}
{"text":"Wait was long but we'll worth it friends! Had the S*%t and it was delicious! It's like a deep fried sushi tempura but better! Many meat selections and seafood. Very good quality as well... will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Thursday night. To my surprise, our party of 8 was seated within 5 mins. Must try out of all KBBQ in Las Vegas! Server was very attentive and food came out quick!"}
{"text":"This place has great service and is so good!! I loved the bean sauce to dip the meats in! So delicious! Seated very fast! Nice place !"}
{"text":"Best place EVER for AYCE Korean. Been there 3 times in the past 2 months and want to go back already. Price is great for the amount you can potentially eat."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Between Tofu Hut and Hwaro, I choose Hwaro because of the variety of meats they offer. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys KBBQ."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Korean BBQ in Las Vegas. Aside from the reviews telling you it's a good spot, check it out if you can. The line and wait will tell you how popping this place is!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Staff was very tentative to our needs. Nearly ordered the whole menu and couldn't complain about anything. One of the better Korean bbqs I've tried outside of kbbq in LA. They have a delicious house sweet sauce that's available via the bottle. Def recommend anyone comin out to Vegas that's looking to grab kbbq"}
{"text":"Food was great service was great! The only downside is they serve canned soda instead of fountain soda and they don't have bottled water. We will definitely be back to eat there again!"}
{"text":"For the price and the quality I do recommend this spot. They have over 45 items to choose from their AYCE menu. Try \"The shit.\""}
{"text":"By far my favorite KBBQ in Las Vegas their quality of meat is unmatched! With over 40 items to choose from the 22.95$ per person is well worth it! From spicy pork to enoki beef there isn't much Hwaro is missing in my opinion. There is a 90 minute time limit so cook and order in a timely manner if you want to be able to try everything! This place doesn't do reservations so the wait can be a little long on weekends. However we were told 45 minutes for our party of 8 and it ended up being only a 30 minute wait which was great! Highly recommend this joint to anyone looking for quality Korean Barbecue!"}
{"text":"The meat selection was great!  All with great flavor.  The short ribs and flank steak were excellent but the spicy pork was by far the best!  The service was exceptional with refills of beverages coming quickly.  The servers even helped cut and serve the meat from the grill!"}
{"text":"There is just nowhere that can compete with Hwaro. I loooove it here! They have good quality meat, really friendly staff, and their banchan choices are pretty good! We always order more of the potato salad, kimchi, and fish cakes. Service might be slow during busy times, but that's with a lot of small restaurants so if you understand that fact, then you're good to go! (Oh and parking during busy times is a BTXH!! But it's not their fault. Lol) You must always finish with the plum ice cream. It just tops off all the meat you ate so well. The yogurt soju was also really good!"}
{"text":"We found this place while looking on Yelp for a place to eat in Chinatown. We were actually looking for another Chinese place but saw all the people lined up.   For the price, it's a great meal with excellent service. The wait can take a while to get a table but if you have time, it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good place for all you  an eat Korean bbq they have lunch,dinner and late night prices that is decent . This place stays open late so if your looking to get something to eat at 1am this is a good choice to go to."}
{"text":"I was having dinner with three of my co-interns, and in deciding which Korean barbecue place to go to, we opted for Hwaro because of its competitive price and menu options.   I arrived first to put my name down, and it was about a thirty minute wait at 5:40PM on a Friday. There were a few tables that were not being used, so I was a little confused, but the restaurant was full with many more parties waiting by the time we left.  Service was fine, but it could occasionally be hard to flag down your particular server. There is a 90-minute time limit for your meal. They were good about regularly changing the grill.   There were a few banchan dishes, nothing particularly special. There is an \"all day special\" menu/price, which basically is a dinner menu/price. The lunch and late-night prices are for those specified time periods, and the lunch menu excludes the \"all day special\" premium items.  Overall, the food was not bad, especially for the price ($20.95 + tax). I didn't get to try any pork dishes on this visit since one of my dining companions was Jewish. We were definitely stuffed and satisfied by the end of the meal. I've definitely had better Korean barbecue elsewhere, but this is pretty decent for Vegas.  The interior is casual and the atmosphere is lively, complete with the expected barbecue grill smoke and noise. The restaurant is not all that big though, so just be prepared for a wait during peak dining hours.  P.S. Sorry for the paucity of photos, I was hungry/busy. I will try to add an exterior photo when I am back in that plaza. Oh, and for those that know this plaza, parking is always tough, so just be aware!"}
{"text":"Everything is great!!! My favorite Korean BBQ in Las Vegas! Brisket is awesome! And my favorite is shake shake rice! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try spot. I attend a few conventions a year here in Vegas, and this will definitely be a foodie spot I'll have to attend. The staff is pretty friendly, they are pretty quick with the grill changes. The selection of meats are awesome! The flavors are not to salty and just the right amount of spice. The side dishes are pretty good too, especially the salads. For 21 bucks, you really can't go wrong! I highly recommend their skirt steaks(normal, spicy ,and pineapple) . I don't know what it is, but they also have a killer green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is a good Korean BBQ place in a strip-mall in Chinatown Las Vegas. The food is good, good meat selection, and good service. But it gets crowded, and there is a long wait a lot of the time, especially if you have a group. But the most important thing to remember about this place is unlike many other Korean BBQ places, the portions are huge. So if you ask for a variety of meats that you might ordinarily get at other Korean BBQ places be careful, maybe get half of what you would normally do, or order one by one to play it safe."}
{"text":"Very clean place and service is good, great selection of entree. The music playing in the background is great, but i think its all love songs in korean, all in all, its a great spot to fill your cravings."}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat korean bbq places ive been to. The quality is definitely there, and the price is right also! ($19.99 all day special, $16.99 late night special). I HIGHLY recommend the beef tongue, the beef belly, the short ribs & the enoki beef!!!"}
{"text":"A bit cramped inside. Portions seemed a bit small compared to some other places in town.  Wasn't sure if the waitress understood what please bring two servings of this or that etc.. meant as one serving wasn't big enough for three people. Or if there was a policy we weren't informed. Also a bit concerned by the painting hanging on what looks like a fire exit near the bathrooms. Will not be returning or recommending"}
{"text":"This place is awesome , huge menu. The brisket is probably the best I have tasted in all the Korean bbq's. We will be coming back here all the time."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Really enjoyed the food here! The Hwaro Premium Steak is a must have! Dress appropriately as the room does get a little warm"}
{"text":"My go-to spot whenever I'm in Vegas. Great meat selection and I love the appetizers! Plus dessert!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for Korean BBQ. We've been to several places AYCE Korean BBQ places and this by far have the most selection on the menu. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was not up to the hour and 15 wait after being told it was going to be 30 to 40 minutes. If it wasn't for the company of great friend, this would have been more frustrating. If you have time and are not starving upon arrival, good deal.   The grill settings are too low and the food cooks really slow at the beginning, better have your apron skills down.   It is a bit too loud for my taste, almost like a really rowdy bar atmosphere without the sports and beers...."}
{"text":"Fav place! Try their KFC and kimchi and meats. 17 dollars for lunch and 20 for dinner"}
{"text":"First time at korean bbq and I love It!! Harland was the best!! She was funny and handled all our late night crap like a charm"}
{"text":"YA NEEDS TO GO HERE!!! I can't explain the joy I've for this god damn aycekbbq !!!!!!! For $17 bucks you can live like a kbbq foodie. They got everything, protein to lunch box to desserts. I went in with a party of 6(hungry) left happy(full).   Service was superb, the selection above and beyond.   First time here(10/10), will be a regular now."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean Buffet!! Fast service, tasty food and wide selection of meat and appetizers. They even have yummy ice cream. Reasonable price for a Korean All you can eat. Hostess are really nice and pleasant. Don't miss the shit and padak"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! We went in and they stick is in a booth at the back. It was unbearably hot and stuffy. I looked at the thermostat and it said 89 degrees! That is not acceptable. We told everyone who came to the table that we need to move and they need to turn the ac up. The waiter tells me that its hot because we there are many grills on. That's straight bs! We demanded to be moved and the next table was a bit more cooler than the first. I was too hungry and wasn't leaving til I ate, Hoping the food would make up for it. After we changed tables the service was horrible. I will never go back to that dump!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here often. We have never had a problem and their food is always really well seasoned. We always get \"The Shit\", the short ribs, spicy chicken, and the rib eye. I especially like the spicy chicken here, it's the perfect amount of hot. As dessert (if we have room) we get the affogato, which is vanilla ice cream with korean coffee...amazing!"}
{"text":"As much as I have eaten here in the past few years, last night wait and service kind of makes me want to rethink of going back or even to recommend for those who've never tried..  Be mindful, it's a KBBQ hotspot in Chinatown in a very small plaza area just by Spring Mountain and Decatur. Therefore parking is going to be a pain if you're heading over for dinner especially and it's just nightly thing I've notice since I live and pass by the area so many times after work. The earlier the better for parking I guess if you're lucky.   Now for the wait to even get a table. I think over the multiple times I have visited and dine at this restaurant, groups of four or less are obviously to accommodate than more than four. And since last night was a Friday night the wait time for my group of six was about a two hours wait  than what we originally planned. It kind of ruins the mood to even dine. Which I can understand because the restaurant's space capacity is more medium size and also have to factor on how fast or well other customers are cooking their food. The only thing that bugged me was that when accommodating larger groups and at a busy dinner service, an open available table for you group is another expecting wait. The offer we had was to sit separately, which bother everyone in my group. Why agree to sitting separately when you're group planned to have dinner together. And we were close enough to leave and go elsewhere until a table finally open for us. It also took a member of my group to explain that the wait is unacceptable when being told that it would be a less than a two hour wait and that there should be some kind of discount for not accommodating well enough. So it's just a bothersome for larger groups.  Now for the service, knowing it's busy . Most orders were delayed and they did forget utensils when asked for the soup and steam egg . It's overall not bad it's just lack of communication... which I can see a lot of turnover issues for the restaurant. *Also larger groups should probably just double your order just to avoid the wait on the server to bring you more of what you want.   I never really had a bad experience up until last night's waiting time. I normally always recommend this place to friends but I might hold back to it . I definitely would like to see a better way of keeping the wait list organized than just a clip board and yelling out for the next group outside of the restaurant over a roaring crowd."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the service. Waiting for a table took awhile, but what do u expect from a small restaurant? Oh, & no alcohol. Waiter said something about them getting in trouble so they're waiting for a new liquor license. Floor was wood, so it was pretty slippery, from all the oil. Ummmm.. Oh! Table was a bit small for 5 people lol. Other than that, it's the closest I've gotten to Cali kbbq in Vegas yet!  Update - they have alcohol again! YAAASSSSS"}
{"text":"The customer service here was exceptional! All the recommendations (from Jitto) exceeded expectations. The grill was was changed on a regular basis and he regularly asked if we needed anything else. The food was on point and cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"This is our third time eating here at hwaro the 1st and 2nd experience were great not until we came here today there's something wrong with the smell of the meat that they serve us I called their attention they said that's how its made here,  I told the server that this is not our 1st time eating here so I know what I'm talking about I ask them if they can replace this meat that they serve us and the server said I cannot, we decided to just leave bcoz of unwelcoming poor customer service. We will never come back here again...the Korean guy server with a medium built body atleast 5'7 in height is the one with such super terrible attitude so watch out.."}
{"text":"Back at it again. Ofc food is still the bomb! I get so very full. Servers were nice tho except for the one who served us. Idk her name but she sound sarcastic when talking to us and taking our orders. it's a buffet and were 5 people. I think she doesn't want us to order a lot. She be like \"you sure that are you gonna finish this?\" Like gruhh we ordered it bc we gonna eat it all duhh. Last thing, we were not even done eating and she already give is the bill. Kinda pissed tho. About to give 5 stars but nahh. She's a Filipina btw."}
{"text":"Good place for ayce. Went here for a friends birthday. Excellent place to satisfy your kbbq cravings!"}
{"text":"Hwaro is one of the places that pop up whenever I am craving for some good and cheap kbbq in the Vegas area. Their all day special at $23 has a decent selection of meats while being really tasty compared to some other places that charge a bit more. Going here for lunch has never really been an issue for me in terms of wait time, but it does get busy around 5-6 when people go here for dinner. Parking is also an issue since it is located in a small plaza.  I recommend getting the brisket, enoki beef, skirt steak, premium rib, and the shake shake rice box. The brisket here is pretty tasty and juicy. Enoki beef is also good, but it sucks that you are limited to only one order per person. The shake shake rice box is basically a box filled with rice, kimchi sauce, and comes with an egg. It goes well with the meat you will be cooking. I'd opt for the shake shake rice instead of just eating a plain bowl or rice or using rice paper.  Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who is craving for some kbbq. Service is great and the place is clean. Their prices are competitive and the food is good so what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the food for its price point was also great. For a busy establishment, service was stellar for the size of the restaurant. Flavors were great and the meat quality did not lack in all of the meats we tried. I will come back but maybe during lunch because expect an hour wait time during dinner hours."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place and all the hype. 2 stars because they gave us a personal fan and because of the regular pork belly and squid..  Gave this place a second chance and brought my family here. We wrote our name on the waiting list and they had advised us to sit at one of the normal tables until they called us. We had 3 people ahead of us and I was ready for the wait since we had gotten a snack from Kung fu tea. We were waiting about 45 minutes and saw that a large party had gotten seated before us. Come to realize they crossed our name off because they had supposedly 'called' our name and we didn't answer. Which they did not because they told us to sit at the regular tables until the BBQ tables were clear. We then told them that we would take any table available even though we had 4 adults and 2 kids. After about over an hour they finally seated us into the corner small booth, which ok, we got what we asked for but I was still irritated.   The food is ok. The marinade was very bland. The only thing that I really liked was the squid and the regular pork belly, which that was the only two things that I liked when I came the first time. The brisket was very dry even just seared. We had to get up and ask the servers for sides because they didn't even bring us any! The steamed egg was pretty delicious, we ordered probably 6 of them or even more. I felt like all the meats just tasted like bland meat. I actually couldn't even taste the difference between them all because they all tasted the same! Besides for the marinated pork bellies, which I didn't even like to begin with. The salad was pretty good the second time around. The first time that I came here they had actually forgot to give us salad (we assumed it just didn't come with any) but when they brought it almost half way through our meal, it was drenched with dressing.  For the wait and the service, I might as well have went to woonam jung because even with their shitty service and high price, their food is a whole lot better. Or I would have rather waited that same amount of time at tofu hut for $18, which would've still been better than this place. They also charged gratuity for 4 adults and 2 kids who were under 3 years old. Makes no sense to me, but I guess it's good they did because they wouldn't have gotten anything from me anyways."}
{"text":"First off I shall say the food was good. We had the all you can eat and I say it was a good price. The reason why I rated so low was because the service was very disappointing. There was me two other adults and my child. It took forever to order anything and every time we did order they apparently forgot to give us what we requested and we would have to tell them twice before we got anything or flagged down another waitress.  There was two ladies next to us and my boyfriend asked what food item they were cooking and the guy didn't even know. Luckily we guessed and ordered the right one. And our grill was so smokey I had to scrap it myself and had to keep flagging down someone to change it. Horrible horrible service but food was good. I recommend not to come here if u don't care about somewhat good service unless your really hungry. Can't say much about the food besides being good as if I can do it myself at home."}
{"text":"The food was alright BUT I found hair in my food TWICE! Never again! And it's super crowded! I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! 100% worth the money & wait!! Friendly staff, clean bathrooms and cheerful atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"The service was fast, the prices are comparatively low, and the food is aiight.   The interior is comfortable enough, but not really that special. There are booths and regular tables that can seat up to around 6-8 people.      The service was good. Our server kept our drinks refilled and was always available when we needed her.   The food was alright. I noticed that their sauces are different from the sauces I usually get at Korean BBQ places. Personally, I prefer the regular sauces over the sauces at Hwaro, but I know some people love the sauce here, so it's just a matter of taste. Also, a heads-up: The meat servings are one third of the meat servings at other Korean BBQ places. I'm guessing they're trying to avoid leftover meat that way, but it does make customers have to order meat more often when they don't know about the small portion size. Hwaro only seems to have ice cream for dessert, which isn't too bad of a deal since Sweets Raku is in the same plaza for all dessert fans.   Honestly, the best part about Hwaro is probably the price. It ranges from $16 to $20 depending on whether you come in during lunch or dinner (there is also a late-night all-you-can-eat special) and is thus one of the most affordable Korean BBQ places in town.   Overall, Hwaro is a good place to go for affordable late-night Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I have been here twice, and both times it was really solid.  The first time i went, I brought a friend from canada who never had kbbq before.  The place is super chill, with a hipster vibe.  They had k pop videos playing on a tv while having k pop over the speakers.  We went in pretty late, but it was still packed.  The quality of meat is great.  The brisket was our favorite, with the banchans.  I really enjoyed the dipping sauces that they gave to us.  Staff was super solid.  They seemed a bit overwhelmed, but they were kind to us the whole night.  They did have a mistake on my check, but they fixed it right away.  On the second go, we went in for lunch, and we were the only table there for the most part.  My sister and I were super hungry, so we basically ordered everything on the menu.  I really enjoyed the beef belly and short ribs.  the belly was super fatty and buttery, while the short ribs were very tender, and the flavor was on point.  The baby octopus was also quite nice with a little snap.  The only reason why i didnt give it five stars was because the service the second time was a bit sub par.  Dont get me wrong. when we came in the second time.  Our server was super awesome. But while we were there, there must have been a server change.  We sat for nearly a extra half hour for the check.  We moved our plates and bowls to the end of the table and cleaned up for them to make it easier.  But the new server just stared at us from across the way.  When we flagged him down, he brought us water then walked away.  Other then that, this place is awesome.  It has become my favorite all you can eat kbbq.  The meat is amazing.  Service most of the time is on point, and the price is just right."}
{"text":"The short ribs was our FAVORITE! It was so so so good and melts in your mouth! They have really good sauce for dipping your meat in and unlimited side dishes!   The service was also fantastic as they came by often to check up on us and they were really fast! They did our grill change every time we needed without having to wait at all too!   There's kbbq places where the servers cook for you but hwaro lets you do them yourselves! Make sure you flip your meat, don't wait for them lol.   The place is overall really nice and comfortable! And you don't walk out smelling like kbbq because it's not super enclosed like other places! Definitely try this place because it's affordable and delicious! PLUS they're open till 3am so this is your best option near chinatown (most kbbq places there close at 1am or 2am! And you'd have to show up an hour early before that because of Last Call!)"}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with my friends. Actually I thought hawro is good but services was bad. I know that they have a time limit but I didn't know that it starts when the customers  sit the chair. I don't want my friends to wait in the restaurant that is not enough space. so I went there early. when I asked I could start time 5 to 10 min later,  they said no. I was wait for 30 to 40min but they couldn't give us 5 to 10 min . Anyway that is find if that is rule . But My point is why they changed word. When I was sitting the table, they said 90 min was only \"all you can eat ordering time\" so you could sit more than 90min.  but 90min later we couldn't order any drinking and we need to order our dessert even though we didn't finish dinner.  Of course I asked we could have our dessert after dinner, they said no and just told us your time was done. I know another people waited a table but we were your guest, too. You need to know that if somebody wait the table that is not our fault. you can make more table. I don't understand why you make the guests are uncomfortable.   I regreted recommending the restaurant.  If you can eat fast or you can be a food fighter , you can go.  but  you couldn't,  it is better don't go.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Jitto is the best of the best! Made our experience so much greater. Food is great! Try to stick to straight bbq. Apps just fill ya up. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't remember how many times I have been here. But every time I always gave them 5 stars. They never make me disappointed if there food or even there services.  I just found that Garlic Jalapeño Pork Bally, Signature Pork Cheek and Bf Frank were awesome."}
{"text":"It's a good AYCE Korean BBQ spot in the complex! Although the parking is terrible, if you come during the afternoon on a weekday you'll be fine! But good luck finding parking in the evening! I love how it's $20 and there's a lot of choices! However, this place lacks seafood. There more of a meat Korean BBQ and there's nothing wrong with that but if you want seafood I wouldn't come here. Their water is on your table so you don't have to badger the waiters asking for water. There's also sauces on the table and they fit well with the meat ! The salad is amazing and I truly love how refreshing it is! I love going here cause I'm more of a meaty gal rather than a seafood gal"}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas for nine years, and I believe this is now the fourth or fifth restaurant to be in the same location.  My most recent visit on September 27th left much to be desired.  A friend and I ordered Sundubu and were seriously disappointed.  Being Korean, it's hard to get too excited when eating out at a Korean restaurant, but the Sundubu here was awful.  All it had was tofu, water and some chili, which means there was absolutely no taste.  Making matters worse was the fact that the banchan had no taste, including the Kimchi! I'm not sure how you manage to screw up Kimchi, but this place did it.  It was also a disappointment to find out that they did not have their liquor license, so the normal Soju and Hite Beer were also absent, along with any taste that should have accompanied our meal.  I'll stick with Honey Pig, E-Jo or Sura."}
{"text":"Ok, so upon entering the wait is a little long....most due to them being slightly under staffed. There are only two servers for the entire place. (14 tables)  The two employees were both extremely polite and they were definitely trying their hardest to attend to everyone. Next, the decor...it is very spacious and I loved the eclectic design they had going on. Lots of natural woods and concrete.   Ok...on to the food!   Everyone who loves Korean BBQ obviously loves meat, but I think the starters can make or break a KBBQ spot! Their salad is GREAT! Super crisp lettuce, the sweet and savory dressing has just a touch of heat too! Their other starters include Mac salad, marinated jalapeños, kimchi, marinated tofu and bean sprout salad! Everything was SUPER FRESH!   The main courses...very good! The \"fat ass\" or wine marinated pork belly was our favorite! The short rib and beef flank were OKAY. We did enjoy the baby octopus too!   The steamed egg and the complimentary soup were both very good!   The $19.99 price was superb for the quality of food!   (Update) A third worker did so up to wait on tables mid-way through our meal! I can also say all of the workers were extremely nice!   Solid KBBQ spot!"}
{"text":"Very good very friendly, not overpriced, good selection of food. Good Quality. I would recommend to go, and we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE KBBQ spot in town.  Pricing:   - All Day Specials (aka normal dinner) - $22.99 - Late Night Special (10-3am) - $19.99  The main difference between the two is that some of the more expensive meats are not on the late night specials (notably Beef Tongue and Short-rib)  Pros:  -Appetizers are very tasty & offer a change up from the usual BBQ. - Large restaurant, so the wait time is not horrible, but can get long on the weekends at night. - Speedy Service - Large menu  Cons: - Parking is a PAIN. The plaza has 4-5 very good restaurants, so parking here during dinner time can be a nightmare, you've been warned. -Don't always have rice paper (they run out sometimes)   Menu Items I like a lot:  -Beef Belly -Pineapple Marinated Steak -Enoki Wrapped Beef -The SHIT! (That's what it called..) -Corn Cheese -Brisket -Pork Cheek  Dessert: -affogato (espresso & vanilla ice cream)   My go-to spot for KBBQ. Reasonable price and a large variety of tasty food."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the first time I came here and avoided the place for the longest time. I heard that they had a change in ownership so I decided to give this place another try. I've been here a few times in the past few months and it's a lot better than my first experience but does not top some other Korean BBQ places I've been to. Although I do have to say that this spot is great for late night owls and the price is pretty reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"My 100th review! We enjoyed going to Hwaro for our ladies night out. Parking is a bit of a pain though and since the restaurant is kind of small you usually have a little bit of a wait for a table. We waited about 25 minutes for our table but conveniently they have some tables for you to sit at while you wait for a table with a grill.   Love that before you even sit down they bring all the side dishes out for you to start munching on. The service was friendly and attentive. The meat selection was vast. The ribeye and baby octopus were my favorite dishes. They were marinated with perfection and were fun to cook.   Everything was pretty good just wish they had more of a selection of desserts as part of the AYCE. The green tea ice cream wasn't my favorite but then again I'm picky with my green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's possible to beat $18 AYCE for lunch, but that at least explains the long wait. Fortunately, we came around 2pm and didn't have to wait more than 20 or so minutes. The menu is substantial since it includes all sorts of appetizers and side dishes in addition to different types of meats, and it was sufficient for us since we weren't fancy enough to appreciate the several additional meat options that one could get for the more expensive all-day AYCE option. We arrived at our table to find it all set up with some starter banchan, salad, and water, and we were able to start ordering right away. In general, I enjoyed the beef and chicken options a lot, the latter especially since they were well marinated. Pork cheek was also very good, while the pork belly was mostly okay (ours seemed to have less flavor than the others). None of the appetizers really stood out to us--The Shit was just a fried sushi roll, which wasn't anything special. Going back I'd probably focus more on the side dishes to get pickled veggies or spices that complement the grilled meats. Unfortunately we were all too full to try the Shake Shake Rice, but it was awesome that each person got a dessert at the end.  My main complaint was that the service left a lot to be desired. Our people didn't seem to be very interested in taking more orders when we were ready, and it looked like changing the grills was a chore for them. Just try to look past that and focus on the food."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite AYCE KBBQ in Vegas hands down!!!   Best things about this place:  - their all you can eat menu includes 1 steak per person and it's soooo good.  - their cuts of meat, in general, is really good. The meats don't come to our table frozen to the point that it seems like it's been sitting in the freezer for days like other KBBQ places I've been to.  - their menu selection is huge! They offer a ton of appetizers and side dishes. I love their bean paste soup.  - the atmosphere and the service is phenomenal. I mean sometimes the music can get a little too loud, but I feel like that's just all a part of the experience   Can't say bad things about this place. I pretty much feel like I find myself here weekly.   Oh, and if you write a review and show them, they should be giving you a bottle of beer on the house!"}
{"text":"You know when you see those giant banners over restaurants that say \"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!\" and you roll your eyes thinking nothing is gonna change then finally subduing to your stubbornness you give the restaurant another try to find out everything is 10 folds better? Yes, no, maybe so?   Still not better than the new non AYCE place, but hot damn, what a comeback. An expanded menu with better quality meats, MUCH cleaner floors (they used to be oily), better banchan, existent service, and same weak ventilation systems. At $20 per person for dinner, it reigns supreme in Chinatown for AYCE KBBQ. Also to up the ante for your late night eats, its $17 after 10PM to close.  Some favorites were the brisket, pork cheek, and the beef short ribs. The pork skirt steak had a weird after taste and would recommend to pass on it."}
{"text":"The Hwaro is the best BBQ place in the vegas and you must come to try it! Nice service and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty good place to get some kbbq. The food was really fresh and tasted great! The service was great as well except they were a bit under staffed so it was slow. But the waiters made it good. The only thing i didnt enjoy was the fact that there were no veggies so its literally all meat. If you are a big meat lover, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots here in vegas! Great good, great service, what else can you ask for?? This place beats tofu hut and Korean gardens with no doubt. Btw, this is the only kbbq spot that I know where you can order a whole slab of rib eye!"}
{"text":"Second time to come here , I love Korean buffet and i met the great Korean buffet. Good service and good qualities of food . You should try."}
{"text":"...thought id try something new... fail.  I literally had to flag down a server 6 times. For drinks rice refills scissors tongs... meats werent great either. Now i know why they say you get what you pay for...   Please turn up the AC. Its over 100 degrees out.   I asked the server what the meats were that was served to us since it didnt look like the briskets i was used to and he literally said \"i dont know. Its my first day here.\"  Pay the extra money and head over to honey pig, woonamjung or djk..."}
{"text":"I came here 2 days in a row with my boyfriend because it was so good. We did the AYCE Late Night Special and I believe it was around 45 dollars for both of us. Our favorite appetizers were Shit,  Eggrolls, and the KFC Must try: Skirt Steak and Cajun Chicken Ask for Sesame seed and oil is so good to add it to your meats while cooking it! Also the sodas are canned not fountain, we usually just drink the water. PARKING IS VERY LIMITED thats the only CON"}
{"text":"I love hwaroooo it's my joint ya know go here hella times just to eat hella brisket ya feels. This is my joint."}
{"text":"Cant beat Hwaro for it's price. Great meat selection and we always get the Shake shake rice. Great complement to the BBQ. It's weird it says only one per table though because we had the big table with 7 guests. They should make that clear. I like d this place too cause they include a service of desert with your meal."}
{"text":"Really good place for ayce kbbq. The joint looks super cute inside like an old school restaurant in Korea with all the wooden decor etc. Come early, there's always a line. They kind of rush you as soon as you're done eating bc there's always a line. Meats taste amazing. Nothing bad to say. Will most likely come again every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It's not Hobak but, you know...it's cool....  for around $25 all you can eat dinner, it's good!  Cook your own food KBBQ with good portions for my 3-party Valentine's dates. we waited about an hour for dinner, which is pretty standard for KBBQ at most places.  Bonchon was ok. Steam egg was one per table. I liked the potato salad. Bulgogi nachos were more like bulgogi on top of the last chips in the bag aka the small broken parts. Cheese corn was too small: AND they had onions in there, which I really hate. Considering the cheese corn was a small portion, it took quite some time to cook/melt. I will give it to Hwaro for their dessert. The affogato with cereal on top was suuuupppperrrrrr yummy. Prolly my favorite dessert at any KBBQ spot.  Like most other KBBQ places, it's small and crowded. The vents above the grills SUCK. So, you come out of there smelling like KBBQ -- not the worst smell in the world lol  I would come here again (if Hobak was closed) lol"}
{"text":"Great prompt service. Perfect food and meats . Recommend the sliced ribeye .the AYCE special is always worth it. The Shit (stuffed jalapeños is one of the best appetizers ive ever had great perfect spice and heat."}
{"text":"....meh.... I mean, they don't grease up the pan, so the meat sticks. It's not over an open flame. In the words of Fletcher Reed from Liar Liar, \"I've had better.\""}
{"text":"The go-to Korean AYCE for me. Appetizers always on point especialy THE SHIT. Beef brisket is always a must. Bean paste soup is slightly spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"Hwaro is good, but it's not amazing. The seating is very limited due to the space being small, and it's really hard to find parking because it's always busy at night. The service and food is great every time you go, but nothing is eye-catching. I'll always come here though!"}
{"text":"Man o man. This is place to be. Fast service. Friendly staff. Bring you a lot of food not like other Korean bbq. Must try if your in area. I'll b back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been dying to trying Korean Barbecue and we heard amazing things about Hwaro. This place definitely didn't disappoint! We walked right in and got a table that was already prepared with side dishes, water, and everything needed to start the barbecue experience. Our server, Hanchie, was so kind and helped us navigate the menu, making sure we ordered all the best stuff! Everything on the menu is incredible, the meats are amazing quality and the seasoning is fantastic. The sides/appetizers are amazing as well, I recommend trying \"The Shit\". Ying and another female server working that night were also really awesome! They always made sure we had enough food and drinks. The service is top notch, the food is awesome, and this place is a home run!"}
{"text":"This was my second time getting Korean BBQ after experiencing a subpar restaurant in California, and this one finally introduced me to what the hype is all about. Great quality meat and they have unique appetizers. It's a great value for all you can eat, but the service can be slow. When we were there, we noticed that there was really only 1-2 servers for all tables, and there was a long line of people waiting. Only come when you have time to spare.  Tip: if you check in on Yelp and write a review, you can get a free Korean beer!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Korean BBQ in LA. This place was right on par with my favorites. They kicked it up a notch with garlic butter to dip their delicious meat in. If I stroke out from eating too much meat there, I will enjoy the garlic butter in heaven...  Garlic butter appetizer is a definite must. Chicken bulgogi was new to me, but yummy."}
{"text":"The best korean bbq in town. The skirt steak and the beef belly are the best in the barbecue menu. The sh*t and the shake shack rice are must-try. The place is nice and clean, servers are friendly and makes sure that they get your orders right. The down side is the wait time, we waited for 1 hour but that probably justifies the quality of the food and service with the amount of people who come here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Saw a Yelp review a few weeks ago for this place and my friends and I decided to stop by.  But they close early on New Years Eve and they close on Christmas. Regardless of that, we finally made a trip to Hwaro! This place has Awesome food and great service! This place opens until 3am!  Huge selection on food and apps! Check the pics out!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I got there a little early (around 5: 30pm or so)  so there wasn't a long wait for us to be seated. I like the set up of the restaurant.  For it being a small place,  it isn't overly crowded or anything.  The presentation when you're first seated is nice too.  I wasnt expecting there to be sides on the table already. The things I really liked was the spicy pork bulgolgi and  the steamed egg. 'The shit' was pretty bomb too. I wasnt a fan of the beef skirt although they recommend it. It was a big portio,  but I wasn't impressed by it.    Service was really good. The staff are very attentive. The price was good for AYCE too.  It was a little over $24 with taxes.  I'd go again whenever I crave Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it's opened and have always left satisfied. It's all you can eat and for the quality and price,  I would recommend it to anyone. I love pork belly and they have a few varieties. The green tea one is especially delicious. Looking forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"Omg. I love this place!! Quick service, so many choices of meat! We ordered beef tongue and usually you get a few slices, but nope. This place gives you a huge plate full!!! We ate so much... there were a few \"funny\" items in the menu. The shit and something else (the box of rice) . They were very meh. I would skip it because I would just focus on the meat! The ban Chan were decent. The wait was long though. I think we should just waited an hour for 2 of us. But for the price? Worth it! I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.   :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas. I've used yelp app for 3 years. I didn't review. But this time I  am really really satisfied. Brisket, Pork Belly, Prime pork, Skirt Steak, Bean Paste Soup,  Steamed Egg, The Shit.... All of them are very awesome. I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Located in the same plaza as Monta Ramen and KungFu Tea, good luck finding parking at night! Aside from that, it is probably one of the best AYCE Kbbq in town. But be prepared to wait especially on weekend nights. Love coming here after 10pm because they have their late night special which is the same price as their lunch, $19.99.  Service 4/5. Waiters are usually attentive and very nice. Never had a big problem with service here.  Food 4/5. Take advantage and do half orders so you can try everything. I really love brisket, so when I go to Kbbq the first thing I will usually judge on is brisket lol. But like every other Kbbq place, sometimes you will get an AMAZING fatty, marbled plate of brisket or sometimes you will get an OK batch of really thick and chewy brisket (bleh). Hit or miss. Pork belly on the other hand... always a hit. I think they have the best pork belly for an AYCE place. It's sooo thick and juicy I'm even craving it now as I type this. My newest favorite is the beef belly. If I'm not feeling that OK batch of chewy ass brisket, at least I know beef belly will be nice and fatty and never let me down. Oh and only one steamed egg per TABLE. So even if you have 3 people in your table and you all want steamed egg, you have to share that one steamed egg and finish it before you can order another.  Boo.   They are open until 3am and last call is 2am I believe. You won't be disappointed coming here, like I said just be prepared to wait because it is a popular Kbbq spot."}
{"text":"#HwaroSTUFFED. This place is great.  Plan to wait 20-40 minutes to get a seat but it's worth it.  Great quality meats and good service.  Try the yogurt Soju!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The young girl that works in the front is insanely disrespectful and bluntly shows it."}
{"text":"I flew into town for my brothers birthday and his only request was to eat KBBQ. After looking through yelp we saw this place and decided to test it out.   This place is definitely a must try. The sauce for the meat were really good, not sure what their secret is but it was pretty bomb! Next time you're in Vegas and want some yummy kbbq come here.  Side note. Service was exceptional! Jayden was our server and he anticipated all of our needs. He came over with refills and changed our grill without even asking. That type of service is definitely a reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Let me put this out before I even start:  Vegas has absolutely nothing on Los Angeles when it comes to KBBQ.  There, I said it!  This review was for my attempt to eat at Hwaro on May 28, 2016.  Now, for my rating:  the one star rating is for not allowing single diners (i.e., people who dines/eats out alone).   To think I showered considering I was planning on having  KBBQ,  drove all the way from Henderson only to find out:... - me can no eat !"}
{"text":"Big Bang, 2ne1, Girls Generation, Got7, BTS is on the menu. Lol, sorry that was a list of groups based on the Kpop music that was playing throughout my dinning experience. Brings back memories when I was crazy for Kpop music and still occasionally listen to it. However, my main reason for this particular visit was for an AYCE Korean BBQ meal. It's been awhile I haven't had Korean BBQ, overall it was an ok experience. We got a variety of meats but nothing really stood out with the exception of the beef tongue, which was really good.   They had a good variety of Banchan but the salad was delicious with a good amount of dressing and lettuce pieces that were fresh. The sesame oil dipping sauce that was provided was an excellent condiment that paired well with various meats especially with the beef tongue. Portion was quite generous but didn't have the same quality that you would expect from many Korean BBQ restaurants. The price point is what really draws a lot of people here, especially millennials looking to experience Korean BBQ. Do expect to wait to be seated especially during peak times since this place is located in the same plaza with many popular foodie joints.   My only complaint was the service, there were times when the servers never came around and the constant flagging a server to help us was a bit frustrating. Other than that, Hwaro is a descent choice when your craving for a mountain of Food but for now I'm going to think twice about going back again.   2017 Yelp Review #47"}
{"text":"Pretty fast and friendly service. They are pretty quick to change out your grill and take your order. I love the kalbi! Much better than tofu hut. 19.99 for ayce dinner."}
{"text":"Tried Hwaro and now it's actually my favorite Korean bbq place. I love the service and the food."}
{"text":"Side dishes are good and affordable price. And you must try their \"shit\" and \"shake shake rice\"."}
{"text":"This is an AYCE location with very many options. There is always a wait, but it's usually worth it. You cannot make reservations so be weary of large parties, especially since there isn't much parking. I love the brisket and the salad here, and they have a keen eye for when it's time to change the grill."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! Everyone was very attentive and made sure everything was full. The side dishes are very good, must try the potato salad and tofu skins. Meat is very fresh and good. If you're looking for a affordable kbbq this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"First off - all you can eat Korean food for one low price! It was nice to just start ordering - kalbi, premium steak, bulgogi and the list went on...  I recommend the premium steak. I wasn't a big fan of their \"The Shit\" appetizer. Sorry, it wasn't \"The Shit\" to me.. it was \"The Ok\". Haha  I wish they had more dessert options and the day we went, the AC was broken so that sucked....  Overall, they get four stars for the service and the fact that you get all you can eat Korean food for under $25."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't review this place yet. This is one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in town. This is my to go place since it had open. They have a good variety of meat to choose from and the portions are a good amount when you order the first time. We usually get the beef belly, enoki beef, brisket, beef tongue, short ribs and green tea pork belly. \"The shit\" is pretty good as well. It is nice because they change your grill often. Depending on the day and how crowed it is, the service goes up and down. But usually it is pretty good and the servers are pretty sweet. The location is amazing, but the parking can be really bad. The restaurant size is not that big, so it can get crowed really quick. The dinner rush is usually the longest wait time."}
{"text":"I always come this place with my husband and his friend!  The beef tongue, short ribs are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love hwaro!!! It's so delicious! :) I'm never disappointed when I come here, definitely coming back and bringing all my friends!"}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE Korean bbq. Good price, Great meats, good side dish as well. especially  i love green onion salad  Must try!"}
{"text":"Hwaro has been on my radar since it opened a while ago. I think that their menu has a better selection than most KBBQ joints in Chinatown. The interior is spacious, and they even have tables that specifically accommodate smaller parties. In my case, my friend and I got an area of the restaurant that has a \"private room\" feel to it because of the dividers separating us from other people dining in.  The meat did not look questionable in quality, which made me feel better about going all out here. The pork and squid take the longest to cook, but they're SO worth it. I suggest getting the fast-cooking items, like the brisket, while you wait for the other things to cook so you're not waiting hungry.  A few notable items on their menu were:  The spicy chicken: it had a unique flavor that's hard to describe with words and it wasn't too spicy for my palate. There's no need to dip it in any sauce because it's already flavorful as is.  The butter fly (the shoulder part of pork): like I said before, pork is the longest cooking item on the menu. You can't be too careful with pork, so we let it cook for a while. It's savory & tender without the overbearing fat flavor.  The enoki beef: this is my FAVORITE thing on their menu. The beef was tender and had the melt-in-your-mouth factor to it. The mushrooms enhanced the flavor even more, giving it a richer flavor. It's a shame that it's only one order per person because this is the best tasting thing I've ever had at a Korean BBQ place!  With friendly service, quality menu items at a decent price, and a spacious & modern interior you can't beat it! This is hands down my new favorite KBBQ place in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super delicious! I would recommend to anybody here! Very convenient!"}
{"text":"If someone asks me to recommend a Kbbq restaurant in vegas, immedietly ill recommend HWARO! Price is reasonable and theres alot to choose from on their menu."}
{"text":"Great place!! Very different but really good experience and food! Cooking it myself was the best part! All you can eat for $17.96 after 10pm!"}
{"text":"First time at a KBQQ in Vegas. Late night special $17.95 - really good deal! Premium Steak and pork belly are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Made me and my girlfriend sick. Meat was rotten. Don't have normal kbbq sauces, their sauce tastes like cardboard. They don't cook the meat for you. The grill is also abnormally small."}
{"text":"The kalbi and brisket are okay and for the price this place isn't too bad though the service needs significant improvement. Orders and requests are frequently forgotten and when we were first seated it took them 20 minutes to give us a menu, which only happened cause we got one of the waiters and asked them directly. Perhaps cause the staff is new they need more training and they could benefit from hiring more workers (especially more experienced ones). The meat selection has your standard beef and pork Korean BBQ cuts. Also they will not change your grill unless you ask them. Be prepared to be active and take the initiative should you choose to dine here..."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment from the food to the service I don't know the high yelp reviews on this one."}
{"text":"Awesome service & food. I am from the Bay Area and we do not get this kind of service. The waitresses came to check on us very often. They replaced the grill without us even asking. We never had to wave down the waitresses to ask for more meat. There were a lot of meat choices. In the Bay, some places charge extra for kalbi. The kalbi here is included in the all day buffet for only $23. Great value & taste."}
{"text":"Food is very good but the wait time is extremely long. We were in line for nearly 2 hours and just finally sat down and they served us very quickly though. Biggest issues is that they take a long time to clean their tables and you sit there looking at empty tables."}
{"text":"Been a KBBQ fan since I stepped foot in this place. I almost go there 3-4 times a month just to get my BRISKET cravings or my protein gains.   Genuine customer service from the crew. Look for Jitto, Harland, and Scott! They take good care of you.  The ambience is on point (talk about KPOP music that hyped you up when you're eating and it's like 2 am in the morning!). Line is crazy during peak times: around 6-9 pm. I recommend either going early or just plain being \"patient and wait for 5-6 parties ahead of you\". Talk with someone. It's your chance to meet new people!  I recommend the Brisket, Garlic Jalapeno Beef Belly, Marinated Squid, and the Hwaro Premium Steak!    Special dessert: Green Tea Affogato    Check it out guys!"}
{"text":"High expectation, under delivered.  When I first walked in, I enjoyed the smells, the super hero themes, Korean rap music. Yelp never failed to deliver quality value restaurants in terms of high reviews.  Food smells great, like any other Korean bbq establishment with the normal Korean bbq menus.  My wife and I decided to come here today, but service was at a snail's pace, and we waited over 1 hour before being seated, when I see 4 - 5 empty tables.  They could have been understaffed, so it might have been a focus on the quality of service, but the service was still below average.  My expectations are usually very minimal.  In fact, I expect at least average service with average food (for a Korean bbq establishment) and I would give 4 to 5 stars.  My mind may change after another visit, but my current feeling about the establishment is underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times and always loved it. Food is amazing and although the wait was long, it was worth waiting, seeing how popular this place is! My go to spot for Korean BBQ and to socialize."}
{"text":"OMG YOU GUYS...HWARO IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST AYCE KOREAN BBQ I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. I have been to A LOT of Korean BBQ places and Hwaro is easily THE BEST of them ALL. First of all, it's open until 3am which is frickin' amazing. The fact that it's $20.95 for AYCE with 52 menu items...that already speaks volumes. The meat here is SO good. The brisket, pork belly, beef belly, premium steak...SO SO good. While most of the meat is frozen, the quality is still pretty decent. You are only allowed one piece of premium steak per person, but it's a pretty huge piece of steak. The only things that were unimpressive were the enoki beef and KFC. Since the enoki beef was part of the \"all day special\" and you only get \"one order per person\" I thought it was going to be super special. It is basically a clump of enoki mushrooms wrapped in a piece of beef brisket. The KFC isn't even bone-in chicken, it's more like popcorn chicken. They were just OK. But I was pleased with literally with all the other meats. The beef belly is SO good. Get it! If you love brisket, you will love the beef belly because it's like a more fatty and juicier brisket. It's also cool that they have the \"shake shake rice\" which is basically like your Korean lunch box AKA doshirak. I thought it was pretty weird that our grill never really burned so it never had to be changed but I'm definitely not complaining about that. It's great that desserts are included in the AYCE. I opted for the affogato which is vanilla ice cream with coffee and it was SOOO good. Basically 90% of the menu is DA BOMB. I must have said \"so good\" in my review at least 5x."}
{"text":"Hwaro has quickly become my go to AYCE Korean BBQ spot, despite my hatred for the plaza that it's located in. Of the many times I've visited, I've only had to wait once (which was about an hour on a weekend night). It depends on the evening, but I've experienced good service the majority of the time. In addition to the banchan, there's a number of appetizers that they prepare for you in anticipation of the meat. Some of my favorites include the \"shake shake\" rice (rice, fried egg, nori, and spicy pepper paste), steamed egg, and the KFC (Korean fried chicken). I would also say the banchan selection is better than your average. They have some of my favorites such as fish cakes, potato salad, pickled onions, jalapenos, and of course kimchi. They also have cheese fondue, radish and rice paper, and a number of sauces (salt in sesame oil, soy bean paste, and a sweet & spicy sauce).  The meat quality is decent; it's not as great as a place like Hobak, but you're also getting a meat buffet. My favorites are the skirt steak, beef tongue, brisket, and short ribs. They also have enoki beef (one order per person), which I'm a big fan of. Their seafood is pretty limited to baby octopus and squid. Their dessert options include green tea ice cream or affogato.   I love coming with a medium sized group at one of their larger tables and just pigging out. The decor and ambiance is great. The ventilation is a little poor, but that's something of a luxury at Korean BBQ. Dinner is around $21, but cheaper if you hit it up at lunch or late night."}
{"text":"I love KBBQ and this place was really good. Not only the food but the staff were very welcoming and friendly. They have many selections from their AYCE menu and all the proteins were fresh.   The Beef Belly with Garlic and Jalapeno is hands down my FAVE!!! We also ordered the Pork Belly, Steak, Beef Tongue, Brisket, Baby Octopus (which I didn't eat), Spicy Pineapple Beefsteak, and Short Rib. There were 5 of us and we were stuffed. The sides were your basics, kimchi, pickled radish, fish cake, and pickled onion. It went well with all of the proteins.   The only negative thing that I encountered was the Steamed Egg. It was burnt at the bottom and didn't have much flavor. Other than that, everything was fine.   If you're in the area and craving KBBQ, check this place out. Its pretty good!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best KBBQ place in Las Vegas.   PROS Hwaro has side dishes, appepitzers, and quality meat. For the side dishes, I appreciate how they offer more than your basic kimchi and fish cake; my favorites are the rice paper, pa muchim (scallion salad), and picked radish. For appetizers, they have interesting stuff like cheese fondue to dip your various meats in, bulgogi nachos, bean paste soup, steamed egg, and shake shake rice. Most importantly, they serve quality (I repeat QUALITY) meat for an AYCE place. I recommend the beef tongue (don't hate it until you try it), short ribs, brisket, red wine pork belly, and enoki beef. Also, they give you green tea ice cream or affogato style vanilla ice cream for dessert.   CONS The service is hit or miss. They are always busy and the servers are usually quick, refill your water before it's empty, all that other good stuff, but there have been times where I question if my server have forgotten about our table.   OVERALL You can't be mad about delicious, AYCE, family style kbbq with cute korean decor/atmosphere. I come here at least once a month, and more when I have an excuse to celebrate something lol."}
{"text":"I came here twice with friends in the span of one week after hearing so many people rave on and on about this particular KBBQ place and while there are a lot of options and the meat is good quality, I wasn't blown away or impressed.   The service we got on both days was mediocre at best. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt the first time. Maybe they were just really busy and not accustomed to handling a busy floor? Second time around was the same thing. We had to flag down multiple servers to be noticed. The second time was actually worse than the first time. I'm not sure if it was because they knew we were a larger party and we would automatically be charged gratuity? Not sure.   The first time I came they didn't have the gyoza and green mussels, but was not too hung up over that--they ran out of stuff sometimes right? Second time I came, they had both, but only the guoza ever came. I asked a couple times for mussels, but just gave up because it never came.   I am only giving it 3 stars because they had some unique options that other Kbbq places didn't have such as their Spicy Jalapeño Beef Belly--my personal favorite. They also had a seafood salad (which was something I only expected at a sushi restaurant), as well as bulgogi nachos.   I wish I could love it as much as all the others that rave on about it, but it's definitely a lot more expensive than kbbq places like GEN that cost less and have just as many options, but with better service. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just awesome. Though same as all usual KBBQ in town expect the long wait. What i love the most here? you got bunch of selection regardless of what time.  in rating it 4 starts for improvements. Keep it up hwaro!"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean BBQ!! Great side dishes and price for late night special is only $19.99! Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and so is the service. Pricing is very competitive. Will come again."}
{"text":"Smaller place but seated us after 10 minutes. Beef bulgogi was great! Plenty of selections - 54 for dinner menu and 39? For lunch."}
{"text":"Since I was a young boy I have dreamed of great Korean BBQ. After 25 years in this earth I have finally found it. Hwaro is that great Korean BBQ. Every bite of the delicious food sends massive amounts of dopamine to my brain. When I sleep I dream of hwaro and when Im awake I daydream of it. No such Korean BBQ could ever compare to this Korean bbq."}
{"text":"Came here during Happy Hour with my friend after a long day at the Strip and I have to say, this is one of the best AYCE KBBQ spots I've tried. I'm always eating KBBQ in LA Koreatown and Hwaro did not disappoint.   They have a pretty large menu that consists of a variety of meats, appetizers, and sides. Good atmosphere, service and quality food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"my son actually turned me on to this korean bbq restaurant. now it's my favorite korean bbq place we go to. on his day off, we are sure to go there. he loves korean food! yummy....price is good and service is excellent! this restaurant is a all u can eat but it's not buffet style. even though u get served u are not ignored. be sure u go w/a empty stomach because food is served non stop. also, i love the dessert icecream. you must go to this restaurant. you will not be disappointed! hwaro is a must if you are longing for korean bbq! (table cooking)"}
{"text":"This place is truly one of the best korean bbq joints in town. I would recommend the kfc and padak chicken also the spicy pineapple rib eye along with the angus steak is as good as it gets then finish off with a delicious affogatto ask for it with no cereal. Also service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"These guys kick KBBQ ass. Mad tasty. I wish that I knew enough Korean to be able to say \"Word, son.\""}
{"text":"Work on the strip until midnight so me and co workers and friends who work nights look for restaurants that opens late. They close at 3 and their last call is 1am! Thats 2 hrs before closing??? Came in and tried again, we came at 12midnight. And the lady said their last call is 12:30am. Its like they hate late night customers!!! What kind of restaurant has a last call 2 hours before closing on an all u can eat restaurant???? Owners should read about this and fix it because its not just one customers your turning away. You are turning away potential local regulars!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Always a great stop for a late night feast. I've tried other kbbq places in vegas and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  Edit: Just saw this review and questioned why i didnt give it 5/5."}
{"text":"Been a frequent customer lately....I real like the short rib, ribeye, spicy chicken, and red wine pork belly the best. i usually eat mine with the salad that comes with it. The bean paste soup is a must!!!! i have had a couple not so great experiences with not so friendly servers. They were also out of rice TWICE.   Overall, I dig this place and I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the most amazing, awesome place ever.  I've come with my friend Sean plenty of times and it is always excellent. Top of the notch service.  The best meat in town. I could not live without Korean Bar B Que & our server Jitto is the best"}
{"text":"The wait wasn't that long but it was because many people were coming in for the late night. Cool late night spot for kbbq. The brisket, pork belly and ribeye are all the favorites.   The shake shake rice is what everyone's talking about so we had to order it. It's one order per table. You should definitely try it.   The price is also reasonable for the late night special. With many things to choose from.   They also give out a free drink for your yelp review. Which is a plus as well."}
{"text":"Where to start, I have been to a lot of kbbq around town and I can say this place is one of the top kbbq. Specially with friends it makes everything worth while. It's also cheap! :) come and join! I'm sure you will end up happy when you are done eating"}
{"text":"Well, I guess definitely worth the wait! Heard a lot about it coming into town and it's one of best Korean BBQ places I've been to. Lots of choices for appetizers and meats, and great quality. It's a loooong wait during rush dinner times, we waited almost an hour but we were determined. Try the KFC and the shit, and the brisket is so delicious."}
{"text":"If you love Korean BBQ, and I do, this is the place. Right next to Monta and Kung Fu tea. Cool options on the menu, including some great apps (the shit, steamed egg). Pretty cozy, but nice interior. Good space for groups"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Many different selections to choose from. By far my favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Having been to Gyukaku, Yagyu(closed), Honey Pig, Tofu Hut, Korean Garden BBQ House, Sura and Gangnam, I feel like Hwaro is just another mediocre addition to AYCE BBQ spots in Vegas.   SERVICE  Best one by far, compared to other BBQ spots around town. We had about 3 servers constantly checking on us. All of them were friendly and attentive. Thumbs up for their service!  CLEANLINESS  Took a star off of this. I understand it is difficult to deal with oily stuff. Table was all oily but that's expected (I would appreciate if they took more time wiping the table). What I can't stand was the floor covered in oil. One of the server slipped by our table because of how oily the floor was. We had multiple servers telling us to watch out the step and I was scared getting up from the table. The floor was so slippery! Perhaps wood floor is a bad idea for BBQ place? Or they just have to clean more? I don't know how they can solve this but they definitely need to do something about it before someone gets hurt. My tip would be to wear a slip-resistant shoes. Any shoes with grip will work.   FOOD Another star off. We ordered short ribs, marinated pork and brisket. Nothing spectacular. You get banchan like any other KBBQ place. I would say the quality of the meat didn't match the price. Considering Tohu Hut has a late night special for $13.99 AYCE, I would much rather deal with their rude  service than to pay over $20 for AYCE BBQ that is about the same quality, if not Hwaro is slightly better. I also wouldn't mind paying a little extra and go to Gyukaku, Honey Pig or Korean BBQ House for better quality meat.   CONCLUSION I wouldn't mind giving them a second chance but there's definitely a better AYCE BBQ options in Vegas so this place wouldn't be my first choice. Quality wise, Gangnam, Honey Pig and Gyukaku would be my top choices. Tohu Hut or Hwaro if you are feeling broke/just want to get your BBQ craving satisfied."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Korean BBQ places in Las Vegas I love the variety of meats they have and it's always just a great time!"}
{"text":"New management?  Lets give it a try.  For those of you that don't know, this tiny strip mall has giants for restaurants.  Raku, Sweets Raku, Kabuto, etc.  How does Hwaro live up to their prior reputation under new management?    This is place is good.  I usually have one requirement when dealing with AYCE Korean BBQ and it is: is the meat quality the same after we order it again?  And yes it is.  Soft drinks are out of a can, so that's annoying.   So far, my favorite Korean BBQ place to have a gathering or meet up with someone.  Another plus for me is the appetizers and side dishes you can order."}
{"text":"First of all, grill was already burning and it took a long time~~~ to receive the meats that we ordered. And the server was not great. He completely forgot to bring the food that we ordered and we had to ask other server for the things that we needed. Quality of meat was just ok. Salad dressing was good and had many other varieties of choices but we will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, and service!!! The shit is really the shit it was really good and had to order a couple more for everyone"}
{"text":"Let's start 2017 off right!  With a 5 star review!!  Starring HWARO Korean BBQ!!  I've had my share of Korean BBQ around town and besides the stank of smoke and grease on your clothes afterwards, it truly is a fun experience.  It's like cooking by a campfire, for non-outdoors hipsters...HA!  I gotta say though for AYCE, Hwaro is right now my fave place to go!  Our 1st visit there, if I had to take away any stars, it was for the wait.  On a weekday for lunch, we still waited like 30 minutes for a table!  It was that busy, plus everyone already sucking up their grilled meats were taking their sweet time.  No matter, I'd be doing the same!  Once we got seated though, the grinds came FAST & FURIOUS (not starring Vin Diesel)!  Our table was already set with all necessary banchan:  -Rice Paper (Yes!  Only AYCE in town that offers it!  I love it!) -Green Leaf Salad -Pickled Radish -Pickled Onion -Kimchi (of course I asked for more) -Potato Salad -Fish Cake -Jalapeno & Garlic -Green Onion Salad (man I love onions too)  Cut the cue to the BBQ grill and away we go!  They got ONE menu.  It's got everything you need.  Either pick the Lunch menu for $17.95 per person (over 45 items) or the All Day Special menu for $20.95 per person (over 52 items).  With either menu you can't go wrong!  We chose the lunch menu not only because it was good value but because there were so many other things we wanted to try!    **From the All Day Special menu we didn't get to try the Short Ribs, Beef Tongue, Hwaro Premium Steak, Baby Octopus, and a few other dishes.  Its OK, we can next time!**  Normally we would complain if we didn't get Short Ribs but fortunately our experience was tasty.  Super tasty!  We sampled damn near everything else on the menu:  -Skirt Steak -Beef Belly -Brisket -Green Tea Smoked Pork Belly -Sliced Rib Eye -Beef Flank -Tripe -Hanjungsal (Pork Cheek) -Chicken Bulgogi  How did we do this?  For some items we got a half order, just so we could try it!  Then we order more of the meats we like the most.  We didn't stop there, oh no folks.  We took part in Hwaro's appetizers too:  -Gyoza -KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) -The $hit (kinda like a fried sushi roll) -Steamed Egg (one per table) -Shake Shake Rice (one per table - kind of like a bibimbap)  OH, and don't forget to ask for bowls of RICE!  Extra banchan too.  The meat quality here is very good!  Not funny smelling or slimy at all.  So hopefully the meat is of the fresher variety.  All tasted great too, especially wrapped in rice paper!.  That pork cheek was a surprise, delicious with onions & garlic cooking along with it on the grill!  The appetizers were pretty good too.  I love my steamed egg and the Shake Shake Rice was a nice detour from our carnivore mode.  After stuffing ourselves silly with meat upon meat upon meat upon banchan, we settled for Hwaro's 2 tiny choices for dessert (one per person):  -Green Tea Ice Cream -Affogato (vanilla ice cream with Korean coffee)  Believe me you don't need dessert after eating here, but the Affogato was a nice little palette cleanser to end the meal.  Some strong @$$ coffee!  Green tea ice cream wasn't bad either but I'm fairly sure it's store bought LOL.  Hwaro is a nice joint too, very much for the young crowd with K-Pop music TV blaring in the background.  I love me some Girls Generation while dining on some K-BBQ!  You bet your sweet soju I'll be back!!  #betyourbottomdollarthatHWARO"}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place when I found out it was a buffet.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised...the food was good and you can order as much as you want!  Everything was good including the tofu soup. I would gladly go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I Love this place. I have been here a dozen times. The all you can eat is great and totally worth it.(Especially for someone who can eat as much as me!!!)   Great place. Friendly staff. And Great Food.   The Only negative/con of this place is because of all the stoves it gets alittle hot inside. Best time to go during the summer is after the sun goes down."}
{"text":"My friend from work recomended to me this restaurant, it was my first time, and I don't know what to order but Jun our Food Serve was very nice and he explain very well, the food was great. The Korean BBQ in town. Jun was great. For sure I will back."}
{"text":"One of my absolute faves! All the meats are tasty and well proportioned. Our favorites are the beef tongue, beef belly, and the enoki beef!   This is one of the few places that offer appetizers as well. There's something for everyone! We love the KFC, steamed egg, and the sh!t.   The side dishes are the best in Vegas, hands down. We are obsessed with the potato salad & their green salad!   They also offer a few desserts. The ice cream affogato is a must try! So refreshing and great to eat after all he KBBQ!   Lastly, their service is outstanding! Every time we go, all the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive. They are always available to take orders, and refill water/sides.   I will definitely be back and 100% refer them to anyone wanting a great AYCE KBBQ experience!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving KBBQ-- and we went to Hwaro. Every KBBQ will be packed for dinner.. so pls expect a wait and be prepared. We waited for about an hour after arriving at 7:25. Our server, jitto, was so helpful! It was all our first time at Hwaro and he explained the whole menu. The great thing about this place is it's about the same price as other dinner AYCE places, but t also includes apps, a huge selection of meats and even seafood to grill, and dessert! The meat quality was really good, and the food was brought it very quick and prompt.  Our grill was changed after a while as well which was nice. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite all you can eat Korean BBQ. It's definitely nice inside the restaurant. The wait this long but so so worth it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I book marked it a couple of months ago and stopped by to try something different from Tofu Hut or Sura. I was happy I did.  Everyone knows what an AYCE KBBQ place is. What makes this place different? They have about 8-10 BBQ seating sets. They have a large variety of meats that are unique from other places. Example? They have wine marinated pork belly, green tea marinated pork belly, and marinated baby octopus. They bring out the soup and steamed egg without request and they have a large variety of sides. One of the sides they bring out is cheesy cream corn that gets heated on the grill! The two times I've been there the service was good. The staff is nice and they actually have a lot of workers.   At all of the different KBBQ places there are things I don't like. I either don't like their meat, their sides, or their service. I just like it here. Since you cook your own most places don't come by much so it's hard to get refills, napkins, ect.  I just like this place. They have your utensils and napkins on the table in a container. They give you a pitcher of water so you don't need the server for refills. Their meat selection is not only large but tasty. You won't get bored. Plus the price is right. I was scared to post a review because I like not having to wait for a spot but the secret is out."}
{"text":"All I have to say is friggin delicious. It was about 22.95 a person, total value. Whatever that dipping sauce is, I want to just drink it. So good. We had Galbi, bulgogi, pork belly and the spicy pineapple skirt steak. Also, the shake shake rice, steamed egg and the soy bean paste soup. Everything we tried was so tasty. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ at a great price. The selection includes everything you can imagine plus more."}
{"text":"I first heard of hwaro from my friend. I told him that I was hungry and wanted some meat, I told him of swish, but he countered me and said I should try hwaro. He said it was cheaper than swish, and more meat selection.   So we got to hwaro on spring mtn and decatur, seating was almost instantaneous. They gave us the condiments and a little later some steamed eggs and soup.  I tried the fat ass, sliced rib eye, brisket, marinated chicken.   Well, since there was four of us, they only seated us on a small table....I thought it was going to be enough. Boy I was wrong. I wish we could be been seated in the big table with 2 hot plates. Well, first time, learn from it. The first time was great. We ordered at least 5 batches. But since there was only one hot plate, the cooking was slow. Can't really make it hotter or the plate will burn the meat. I have told the server to just put a rice cooker with us (I eat a load of rice) since they ate pretty slow on giving me more rice. My friends couldn't believe how much rice I ate that time, they would joke worth me by calling me extra rice.   Anyways, we learned from that experience to always get the big table to have to hot plates to cook with. One for beef, the other one for chicken. Chicken cooked slow since you actually have to cook it through. Don't want to get salmonella.   In a week from the first time I've been there, I've been to hwaro four times, and twice a week thereafter. I'm pretty sure the employees remember me and my friends by now. They know where to seat us.   If you want good korean bbq for cheap, they have the lunch and late night specials for only $17...all day special is at $21. Cheaper than honey pig and swish. But swish is a whole different genre of food, so I would still go to swish. As for honey pig, read my other review.  Would I recommend hwaro to my friends? Yes, actually, I already had. Would I eat at hwaro' s again? Yes, and I already had. What I don't like about hwaro's? They're a little slow on giving us more batches of meat and rice. And also, they always put down the flames so the meat don't cook fast....because they try to slow down the meat consumption. Me and my friends would just put it back up, though. Lol.   If they just let the customers eat as much and as fast as the customers can, they would've gotten a 5 stars. But since they throttle down the food, they get 4 stars from me.  Hope this helps any future customers."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ I've ever had! Where were you all my life!! The waiter told us we ordered a lot of meat and said if we don't finish they are going to charge us! Lol we proved him wrong!!"}
{"text":"I had a really great time. Although they were very busy, they managed to help us out with our bbq, clean our grill, and make sure our water jug was full. The water was phenomenal. I don't know if it's tap or not but sure doesn't  taste bad at all. I would come back again. The brisket and rib eye was delicious. The pork belly was thick and good. You can even order half orders. For $20.00 Ayce, I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I\"m reviewing from the perspective of AYCE during lunch time, as these are the only times I've been through the years..and they're A-OK in my book...here we go..  Hwaro service:  I've never waited more than 10 minutes during the lunch visits and the party size is usually 5-7.  Most likely it's because they open at 11:30 AM, but the place fills up quickly.  We've always told them we were on a lunch break and the servers have always been on point with taking care of us quickly.  Grill changes, banchan replenishes and drink refuels are always coming.  Hwaro KBBQ: The $19.95 lunch special meat offerings are more than adequate to get our KBBQ fix on a work day.  The Brisket, Bulgogi, Rib eye and the Pork Belly are all good quality for the price you pay for.  The banchan dishes here that are consistently good for me is: kimchi, fish cake, radish and potato salad.  Their salad is always fresh and tasty here.    Overall, you're getting pretty good value for the price you're paying.  Hwaro Ambiance: Kpop music is playing in the background and the whole dining area is mainly comprised of wood: seats, benches, booths, etc.  You could convert this place into an Izakaya restaurant and barely have to change any decor.  In the middle the restaurant is a leafless tree with random bottles hanging like Christmas ornaments, great social media pic.    Hwaro is located in a plaza which is a hot spot to many trendy Asian restaurants which can make parking a challenge quickly.  If there is a long wait, there are many other KBBQ options in the vicinity.  If you don't have a long wait, Hwaro is a good value based AYCE Korean BBQ stop with great neighboring dessert places.  These are the cards you're dealt with Hwaro, play them as you see fit.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This spot was recommended by a friend. There are lots of kbbq places in the area, but this one stands out. Mr wife and I ordered all of their 'specialties' like The Shit and the Shake Shake Rice. The shit was good, It's essentially a deep fried California roll. The shake shake is a simple version of bi bim bap. Really good for an ayce like this where you don't really need the full dish. We also got the bean paste soup. Standard and simple, but tasty. The meat was excellent. Cuts were done well and seasoned nicely. We had the short ribs, beef flank, and spicy pork. We are not heavy eaters so we were full after that, though i did want try more. Next time! The only small gripe i had was that the servers work as a team to serve every table and they got some of the orders mixed up, but it's no big deal."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dining experience. Loved all of the variety the menu had to offer. The waiting area is a bit small and crowded but we were seated fairly quickly. My favorite menu items were KFC and The Shit."}
{"text":"Very good, I like this. Highly recommended. Meat has a lot of flavor and the staff is very nice"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for late night dinner and drinks! Flew in from Colorado and we were hungry. After reviewing so many great Yelp reviews we couldn't resist trying this place out. We arrived near 11pm and this place was packed! The wait was nearly 45 minutes but hey there is another restaurant next door to get some adult beverages while waiting which we did lol. Once we were seated, we all wanted the all you can eat option for $21 per person - we ordered the red wine pork belly, brisket with Enoki mushrooms, shaken rice in a traditional Korean lunchbox, brisket, spicy pineapple beef steak, corn cheese, KFC (Korean fried chicken), regular pork belly, the spicy skirt steak, and more!   Definitely can't go wrong with any of there meat selections and loved how there was 52 items to order from the all you can eat menu. Love this place!   You can select from a late night special with 45 items for $18 instead of $21 - but why skimp over $3? Seriously."}
{"text":"The best place in town to eat Korean BBQ .best customer service !!   El mejor lugar para comer carne al estilo Korean BBQ, Por un bajo costo y el servicio es excelente!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great atmosphere!  I wish we had ditched the buffet on the strip the other night for this place!!"}
{"text":"The customer service here before they remodeled, was the best! The customer service now, is even better!!! Although i liked how it looked before more, cant deny how nice this place looks now. The atmosphere is pretty chill. One of the workers, gotta say, seems very skeptical at first but when he begins serving you, he is so funny!!! But im not going to lie, i feel so embarrassed whenever i order a Fat Ass or Act Like Korean off the menu that even the servers laughed at me! XD Besides this, this is what I ordered and i think everyone should try it: 1. Pork belly 2. Brisket  3. Tripe (jk dont try this. Its super fat and chewy...and looks like a penis. But if youre into this sort of stuff, by all means, go for it. I personally do not like it, but it doesnt taste as bad as I thought it would.) 4. Sliced Rib Eye (BULGOGI IS ALWAYS THE BEST) 5. Fat Ass 6. Act Like Korean"}
{"text":"When my initial suggestion for a group dinner was rebuffed due to budget concerns, I was more than happy to find that I could make a first-time visit here as our plan B.  Hwaro is the latest incarnation of the all you can eat Korean BBQ restaurant between Raku and Monta. It has changed ownership/branding at least twice now. My group was already seated with banchan on the table when I arrived to join them for the $19.99 per person AYCE dinner. I immediately noticed that the two grills (\"hwaros\") were oddly offset on our long table, and since I was on the opposite side from the grills, I was more than happy to let others handle the ordering and cooking duties.  I didn't take a comprehensive sample of the banchan (side dishes), but I enjoyed the kimchi quite a bit, and there was a seaweed that was pretty appealing. The pickled jalapeño slices are definitely spicy and made me avoid wanting anything with capsaicin for the entirety of the actual meal. The side salad had fresh lettuce and not too much or too little dressing.  I also had a couple of appetizer items (included in the AYCE price). The steam egg indeed spewed out water vapor when it was first brought out, and it was excellent and fluffy. There's just a slight issue in that the crust is clearly burnt, so I had to take care to cut off any parts that were in direct contact with the hot bowl. They also had to order \"the shit,\" which is the same recipe as found in this owner's AYCE sushi places, namely Sakana and Sushi Neko.  I didn't catch the specific meats that they ordered, but we certainly had brisket, pork belly, beef tongue, tripe, and beef short rib. In general, the meats paired well with the salt and pepper oil dip, as well as the sweet and very mildly spicy sauce. The tripe was probably my favorite for the oozing fat, the chewy/crunchy skin, and the marinade, and I was glad that my friend knew how to cook it just right (and ordered me to dip it in just the sweet sauce). The beef tongue had a little more meat flavor than other beef cuts. The pork belly held strong throughout our reorders, and the brisket was fine. We picked up the short rib toward the tail end of the meal, and while it was appealingly marinated, it didn't stand out as much as I'd hoped.  Dessert was one scoop of ice cream, with a limit of one per person. I stuck to tried and true plum ice cream selection, and it was as good here as it's ever been at their sushi restaurants.  Service was good. I don't know if having Korean speakers helped, but they changed out grills often and promptly, and they seemed to respond to all food orders in a timely fashion. I think the size of the raw meat portions varies depending on how many people are in your party.  Out of the numerous AYCE KBBQ places in Las Vegas that I've tried, I'd say Hwaro is my most likely revisit right now. It's a hit in all the key areas of food, service, price, and even ventilation (my shirt doesn't smell of food very much afterward). I'll likely up my rating next time if it's as good or even better."}
{"text":"Legit,  I love me some KBB,  and this place did not disappoint.  Yes the wait was long but that is life in this part of town.  Enjoyed the pork cheeks, beef things, (sorry, it was like rib meat)  it was damn good.   Sides were good and tasty but the were tight on the steamed eggs.  I got over that with the red wine pork belly...  Enjoyed it.!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite kbbq restaurant ever I've been going for almost a year now and not once has this place disappointed me they have great selection and the appetizers are super yummy too!! Waiters are very very friendly. Only drawback is the wartime but if you're a pro at waiting then it shouldn't be a problem and trust me it is worth the wait! 10/10"}
{"text":"Been here so many times ever since this place open. I've been coming back until now! I love the food and over all decorations! The price is a pretty good deal after 10 pm. Bring your whole family for the late night happy hour! :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm...this is the best Korean BBQ ever in Las Vegas. You should try it if you are interest in BBQ."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Probably the best KBBQ in Las Vegas. The price is very cheap, comparing to all the food items you can ordered. The waiting line sometimes can be over hours so come early"}
{"text":"Amazing succulent cuts of meat. Me and my family came here the day after Christmas. We were hungry and I heard about this place through word of mouth. I've seen people waiting outside in front of this place the many times I go to this little strip mall. Well this place knocks it out of the park. When they seat you there is already a good amount of banchan waiting for you at the table. You can get as many refills of whatever you want. There are three price categories(lunch, dinner, all day). All day was the most expensive at around $23 ish dollars and allows you to order from the whole menu. I of course took the all day option because I didn't want to limit my experience. Basically you order what ever meat you want from the menu and however much you want as long as you can finish it. Don't be a monster and order more than you can chew. There's a sign that says you'll have to pay extra if there are leftovers, anyhow be a decent human and order what you can handle. Once the meat gets to the table then you start grilling. The meat cooks pretty quick depending on what it is. The grilles get changed out with clean ones once they start to get black. Believe me, I was impressed by the cleanliness and the pride this place just conveys. The servers were very attentive and friendly. I appreciate that, I did not feel rushed or pressured to hurry up and order something else thinking I wouldn't see my server again. The experience I can safely say was grand and oh so delicioso. I will come here again. Bring your friends because eating here promotes a great way to engage in conversation.  Have a few drinks and just embrace the great time you will have. Salud!"}
{"text":"I've been to Tofu hut, Mothers best, Woo Chee, Honey Pig, and Sura, and this by far is the one of the better Korean bbq places in Vegas. I'm going to keep this short and simple. They brought out our orders on time, they kept bringing us water, and the food was delicious!! From their pork to chicken to different types of beef, it was all yummy. (Even the side dishes were all good ANDDD plentiful) The only reason for it being four stars was because their menu is fairly small and their brisket sauce definitely needed more salt. Other than that, as long as I ask for a side of salt everytime I sit down, I will continue going to this place! :)"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! The lunch price of $16.99 was a deal considering the amount and quality of the food you get. We enjoyed the brisket, spicy pork ribs, pork belly and the ribeye. There was plenty of banchan to sample with the meats and the salad added a fresh accompaniment. Bonus points for the delicious bean curd soup and 'the shit' for the appetizers. Both were really flavorful and appetizing. The only thing I didn't like was the ice cream at the end of the meal which tasted artificial and wasn't creamy enough. BUT I don't go here for the ice cream, so can't complain!  The server also charged us the all day price of $19.99 instead of the $16.99 (we didn't order any of the all day meats). But they were quick to change it and apologetic when we pointed it out.  Awesome place to eat while in Vegas - just don't mind if you smell like KBBQ for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I know the food is good here and the price is cheap. But the service sucks. The tall Korean guy told our group of 11 to go and wait outside. It was a cold night and he was kicking us out? When we called to make a reservation twice they told us no Rsvp's due to the cme conference that is going on. But when we got there there is a reserved table for another group. The Korean guy said that that reservation was made a long time ago. Really? We felt discriminated upon by this guy. The other younger workers there can't really say or do anything as they said he's the \"boss\". Well Big Boss... one of these days, how you treat others will come back to you! I hope you can look at us in the eye next time and not hide behind your peeps and let them do the dirty work."}
{"text":"I really love this Korean barbecue place. The music is great in there, the food, the staff there are excellent, and their affogato was so good. I would go there again to eat their food and their amazing ice cream. The only thing I didn't like there was the wait to go inside, but other than that everything was great for me."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on 5/26/15 at around 9PM. We had no wait time and were seated fast, they brought out many small \"complementary\" dishes and placed them on out table. We had to ask twice what they were before someone would tell us. The biggest No-No for us here is drinks are not unlimited. Thats a deal breaker that will force us to never come back. $1.50 gets you a can of soda, if you want more, pay again. No fountain drinks. They said this place has only been open for two weeks and it really seems you get what you pay for. Service is very lack luster, and the menu (already small) has shrunk since the place opened. Two options have been removed and they cut deserts and soup all together for AYCE. Thats right, with AYCE you get meat, and that's about it. Thats a problem seeing as how there are less than ten options. Having never been to a KBB place before my friend and I were very inexperienced and had no idea what to order or how to cook it. From what we had seen, most KBB places are very nice and will cook your meat for you if you have no idea what you are doing; but not Hwaro. Our pretty waitresses were that, and not much else. They seem very fake in character, and don't seem very experienced at all. On our first order she offered to cook our meat for us and loaded up the grill. Problem is she never came back to tell us when anything was done. So we would have ended us with black meat had we not taken it off really well done. After that first round they never did help us again with cooking preparations or times for each mean, it was YOLO or NOGO. This place messed up pretty bad in our books for many different things. I feel like I got my $19.99 in meat, but if that's all I wanted i'd just go buy a steak and eat it raw. Look someplace else i'd reccommend. This place needs much time to mature."}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain what an amazing place is if you don't mind the wait or cramped seating it was truly delicious!"}
{"text":"Hate waiting for an hour just to get some KBBQ at Tofu Hut and don't mind paying just $3 more? Come here!  The quality of the food is better, the dining area seems cleaner and the wait staff are extremely kind. Iv had nothing but positive experiences here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The brisket and red win pork belly are my favorite. Absolutely amazing  Only downside is that it's always packed in here and hard to get a seat. But other than that. It's absolutely worth it.  The price is solid for what you're getting. Good job."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite KBBQ place!! Every time I try any other KBBQ restaurant, it just makes me miss Hwaro more.  I literally liked every single thing I was served; everything from the salad, the sides and especially the sauce. I even liked their kimchi, and I'm not usually a fan.   The service is also another factor that makes this place so great. They were attentive, friendly, and didn't feel like they were too busy to serve you. Which was especially admirable since it was a bit packed when we went.  Overall, we waited an hour, but I'm not even mad. It was worth it, and I would still recommend Hwaro to anyone looking for a fantastic KBBQ place."}
{"text":"Great place for tasty korean bbq. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. The service was excellent , but the food was top notch"}
{"text":"Great place, one of the best AYCE Korean bbq that I've been to while living in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to eat kbbq here in Vegas! Great selection and customer service :) the hwaro steak was my favorite along with \"The Shit.\""}
{"text":"Really great side dishes.  I liked everything here.  It's a great deal - only 19.99 for dinner.  16.99 for lunch.    The cuts of meat were fresh.  they didn't rush you or try to cook your food for you.  I liked the Kalbi and Short Ribs.  You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Just recently visited and it's a pretty decent variety of meats/dishes that you can get with their AYCE package for the price.  When we sat down, our grill/table was already set with banchan and water. We came right before 3PM, so we were able to get their lunch price but after looking at the menu and seeing that the all day special was just a few bucks more and you get access to more \"premium\" meats, we decided to do that instead.  The downside is that everytime we eat here, it's just me and my boyfriend so we don't get to try too many things before we get disgustingly full. I made sure to try the \"the shit\" and their \"shake shake rice,\" highly recommend! That's what I like about Hwaro, they have a LOT of appetizers available on their AYCE menu so you don't have to JUST get korean bbq.   As we were starting to get full, we asked our server if we can do half orders since a full order was wayyYYy too much meat for two people. However there was a mix up with the kitchen and we were sent a full order of beef tongue (which was a HUGE and intimidating amount for two people). Our server was really nice about it and told us that once the food leaves the kitchen to be bussed to the tables, it can't be sent back, but she understood we wanted a half order so she was not going to charge us for any left over meat. SO NICE! We felt really guilty for the food waste though, maybe that's something that they can improve on.   Meat cuts are decent, the quality wasn't anything that changed my life or that make me wanna crave it. But I would definitely come back and dine here because of the great pricing and the wide variety of dishes available."}
{"text":"Many choices of food. Delicious and good quality of meat. Very busy and crowded, go earlier and prepare to wait a bit!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Korean bbq spot here in Vegas!!!!. It has amazing quality food and awesome customers service . It also comes with desert included in the price . The only downside is the waiting time sometime it 1hr or sometimes it's 15 mins. But it's worth the wait !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Korean BBQ in town! Usually packed so plan on going here ahead of time . Good customer service!"}
{"text":"This place was a stumble upon find. LATE NIGHT looking for some Korean BBQ. Hwari was the right place to come. Inside cubical decorations are very cool. Its like you are somplace else.  Nari our server was very attentive and helped us we all the questions we had. The cow tongue and enoki beef is my two favorite. The baby octopus is a must!! Most memorable piece of the dinner. Worth every penny. Would reccommend to my friends."}
{"text":"My first experience at a Korean BBQ and it was AMAZING!  I know for a fact I will make another visit!  The arrogato ice cream was delicious too!  TIP: Make sure you get your dessert when you know everyone is done!"}
{"text":"Great environment, delicious korean marinated beef, friendly employees...  second time here, I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I love korean BBQ and this place is awesome.  Every time we come to Vegas we eat here. I recommend this to any who enjoy korean BBQ. Great food, great atmosphere, and s great and friendly staff."}
{"text":"So this was my favorite spot to come to for some kbbq. But today ruined it. Mid way through my meal the person busing the table drops a cup of water behind me. Like a normal human being he says sorry and the person waiting on my table saw and said nothing but brought over extra napkins. Now her being the waiter and seeing it happen I felt I didn't have to say anything and get something like a discount. Now I don't normally ask for things like this but my pants were wet as if I sat in a pool of water. So I finish, get up to pay. The cashier finds out our table and the waiter even comes up to confirm that it was our table. And nothing was done not even a apology. I guess they give a shit what happens as long as people pay. I'll take my Business else where."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ (KBBQ) places in Las Vegas! I would 10/10 recommend for service, food and atmosphere. Came in to only a 10 minute wait. The meats they brought were fresh and the side dishes are amazing. The must gets are The Shit and Shake Shake Rice! The green mussels were tasty too; they had a green sauce on them and it was good. We had the best server, Hanchie! He was quick and made our dinner a time to remember! Will be coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I admire the location and environment of the place. Really impressed with the selection of meats and KPOP they play. Great place to take the kids to. Cheap and worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ in town. Hands down. Great food with a cool  atmosphere for a good price! The only downside is the parking! That parking lot gets crazy (like L.A. crazy). Just be aware and try to carpool!"}
{"text":"First time at a Korean BBQ.  Very varied menu, good service, and quite an experience.  However, it would have been nice if the waitress explained the process when I asked instead of just nodding her head."}
{"text":"My wife was craving Korean BBQ when I got home tonight, so instead of going to the places we've been, I asked if we can go somewhere new, a place that I've booked marked. This place was one of the many I have book marked and we were both excited to try.   We even brought our Air BnB guest with us to try it out for our first time. The drive wasn't bad at all from where we live. The parking in the plaza fills up quick so I suggest going early or later. Not during prime time dinner hours.   When we arrived, it wasn't packed. Not even a wait. We signed in and was seated quickly. Looked like we came at a good time.   The service was great. Very attentive and got our table set up quickly and replaced dishes when asked, and took away dirty dishes when done. We didn't have to wait long for our meats at all.   We ordered the brisket and bulgogi, and steamed egg among the already dished our sides. The Bulgogi was delicious. Brisket was dry in my opinion. The steamed egg was a disappointment though. To me, it tasted very grainy almost like sand. I had my wife and our new friend try to, they tasted some grainy but nothing that would cause a concern. To me it wasn't bearable. I couldn't finish it.   All in all, I definitely recommend. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I always stop by every time I have business to do in vegas. Best Bqq in Springmoutain :) good service good food in town"}
{"text":"Tonight we are having a buffet at at Hwaro - All You Can Eat. A must try spot when in Vegas for Korean/Asian style buffet. But be prepare for a short wait time during busy hours."}
{"text":"Still by far my fave AYCE BBQ in Vegas. Quality of brisket is awesome, kalbi is 4/5, and hey have legit side dishes like \"The Shit,\" which I absolutely love.  Weekday is the best time to Come otherwise you're looking at an 1-2 hour wait. I'm digging the KFC today...it was freshly fried and tasted like legit popcorn chicken but better than the fast food chains (of that means anything).   I'll continue to come back on weekdays. Wait at 6:30 was still 30 minutes ok a Wednesday."}
{"text":"good eating place. their cooking stations are clean and well ventilated. food is good. price is not bad at all, very competitive. ill be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"A nice place to hang out and eat meat~!! They have this rice called something like Shake Shake rice where you actually shake the container, so cool~ The mean was delicious in a good amount of proportion"}
{"text":"There are just 2 restaurants in Vegas where you can't make a reservation for and you'll wait an hour to get in... and they're in the same plaza. There are just 2 restaurants in Vegas you struggle to find parking for... and they're in the same plaza. This Spring Mountain Chinatown plaza is POPPIN and sometimes I wonder why. The parking sucks, the restaurants are always packed and they aren't even that great... If you manage to get a parking spot you can eat dinner, have desert and have boba at the SUPPOSEDLY best Asian spots in Vegas all in the same plaza.  Showed up Saturday night at 730PM for a 40 minutes wait (table for 4) The wait at 9PM when we left was over an hour.  Hwaro is AYCE. At just over $20 for dinner and just under $20 for lunch, its cheap. The meat quality is decent, but not the best.  Lots of appetizers to choose from. Shake Shake rice was Korean style toasted rice with egg mixed in. Small portion, enough for 2 people. Stick with the Shake Shake rice. Their white rice is always awful. Wet, not sticky. There is a difference.  Start with bulgogi, beer tongue, brisket if you aren't feeling too ballsy. The other stuff can get pretty fatty and the consistency throws me off.  Only ice cream of affogato for dessert?! Where's my fried banana and mochi?!"}
{"text":"Meats quality is amazing here love this place better than the korean bbq down in socal this place is the boom if next time im visiting las vegas ill come here again for dinner meal the price is decent price that that expensive the atmosphere here is a amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place, my best friend brought me and although it can be a bit of a wait, the experience is authentic and just delicious. It's open until 2am which is even better! Love the fish cake!"}
{"text":"Best KBBQ I've ever been to, and definitely the best value for the money. The wait is long and the repetitive door opening make the wait very hot. But the food makes it all worth it. Try the ribeye and baby octopus"}
{"text":"Would for sure come back here again.  The food was excellent (including sides and dessert yum), service was good, and the ambience was great.    Main dishes: bulgogi, pork belly, beef belly, premium steak.   The steak was actually a steak, very nice.  The portions are also smaller but u can order as many dishes at a time as u want.    The side \"thats the shit\" is good, do it.  The gyoza was crispy and tasty.    Basically will be my go to kbbq place in Vegas.  And open till 3 am for 22.95!"}
{"text":"I can't even try an all you can eat Korean in Austin! Hands down! Hwaro was very authentic and you get your bang for your bucks! All the meats we ordered were so flavorful and great portions! Our waiter was so helpful and very accommodating. Great service, great food and great company! I will be visiting this place when I'm back!"}
{"text":"It's dirty,  the vents are horrible, and the meat is also nothing great. The only good thing I can probably say about this place is that the server was very considerate and nice."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for complete lack of service but the food was really good.  The wait is really long!!!!!! PREPARE YOURSELF! Waited about 2 hours. I hope it's good and worth it. The host kept telling our group another 20 mins... then another 30 mins... gradually extending the time until finally 2 hours has passed... At this point it's nearly 940-945 that we are seated.  We ask the host of its possible to get the $18 price for 10pm since we've been waiting sooooo long and he says no.. by the way his name is Scott. They also ran out of the skirt steak. Bummed yet again.  I'm in customer service and I make damn sure to make the person happy. So it hits me hard when I rate a restaurant. And he's doing the opposite of this. We do get our food and I'm really happy with it. Is it the best I've had? Probably not but it was really good (maybe because we were starving for 2 hours). Ok I'll talk about some positives - lots of variety of meats (like green tea pork belly), other things besides meats for AYCE (Korean fried chicken, sushi - but the orders are small! We had to order multiple for us). I do wish they had more ban chan. We had to ask several times for refills... When dessert comes around (which is cool because it's included in the AYCE) we are tired and have been there for 4 hours and just want to go home. I ask Scott if there are to go containers that he can put the ice cream in and yet again he says no. Cmon Scott.  So just to warn everyone! Food is great, service is not. I guess that's just how your typical Asian restaurants roll. I should have expected this."}
{"text":"Good Korean food and price is decent and the shake shake. Rice is yummy so far so good :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Service! Came here for KBBQ because it's AYCE and the service was fast. Really nice and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and amazing meats. Id definitely come back. ACE totally worth it. Count on a short wait, the place is very popular. Lots of variety on side dishes and a variety of sakes. Parking can be a bit tight but there are some spots on street available too."}
{"text":"Came in after seeing the yelp reviews, I'm from out of town and definitely go to KBBQ in my area quite a bit so when I came here I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary, but omg It was amazing and the menus was plentiful more than the average KBBQ in my area. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back on my next visit to LV the service and food were amazing!"}
{"text":"First time and it was great!  I wish I had to stomachs. Everything was great. I really like the brisket and the shit was the shit. It started picking up @ 530."}
{"text":"When the wait at Hobak are too long what other alternatives are there? Tons of AYCE Korean bbq joints that are sub-par and fail to deliver there is one that I go to. Don't save it tomorrow, go ahead and try Hwaro!!  Setting: In the very busy sweet raku/kung fu tea plaza, expect to come to the restaurant and being seated right away or waiting (obviously weekends are expected). The inside is nicely spaced out with decent ventilation. They have a rule that you can't eat if you come alone? haha so find some friends  Food: The grill itself is pretty poor and won't give you an even char for beef meats but is adequate for brisket, sam byup sal, and spicy pork belly as long as you cook on the perimeter so the juices can drain giving the meat a good cook. They just added what they call \"shake shake rice\" which is the gold tin can that contains white rice, egg, red pepper paste, and nori so shake that bad boy up and enjoy!    Dessert: They offer affogato (vanilla ice cream with a cream coffee pour) which is quite nice and unique for a kbbq place.   Service: They now grill your meat which is definitely a hobak influence but be mindful because the servers tend to multiple tables and may flip the meat when it's not ready. One thing I didn't like was after we paid, the lady came and started cleaning the entire table off to basically tell us to get out for the next customer? Subtle? not really but we got the hint.   Overall: Amongst the AYCE kbbq i like coming here if hobak has a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite korean bbq ever. If you compare with kbq all restaurant in vegas , this place its really cheap. Alot of options for appetizers and meats. Definitely we will coming back.."}
{"text":"I have tried different korean restaurant and I thought they were the best but when I knew this place. The WORD BEST isn't enough for this place. The #1 Korean bbq! Good service and very relaxing ambiance. Will surely be back. Even my 20 months old baby boy likes the food and place. Definitely deserves a five star for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service! This is a must go to place when in vegas, best korean bbq in town, all you can eat!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite kbbq place in Vegas. I come here at least once a month. Love the potato salad, shake shake rice, fried chicken, and the yogurt soju is amazing."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best kbbq joints in town without a doubt. The selection of meats and different choices of appetizers and sides are what makes this place unique. A great place to have dinner with friends and to chat and the afogato dessert is the best way to end it all. Just keep in mind though, this place gets very busy and seating is limited, so on a busy weekend expect to wait about 35-50 min for a table, but it is definitely worth the wait !"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was absolutely delicious. They had a ton of options to choose from and everything we tried was great. I recommend \"the shit \" which is a mixture of spicy tuna and crab wrapped and deep fried. So Good! We went on a Saturday at around 5pm and the wait wasn't too bad but it got busy really quickly and when we left, there were people waiting outside for a table. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"My new go to for all you can eat Korean. This place usually is packed and there's a wait but we decided to go here after we won a tag team poker tournament! My friend Shannon and I just did the late night option since she doesn't eat much and I knew I couldn't eat everything. Everything was delicious and flavorful. I loved the sides and variety of options this place has. MY only problem is that they didn't have any kind of Shrimp on the list and I LOVE SHRIMP! Please add shrimp to your guys menu option! Then my life will be complete! I liked how they set up the side dishes for you before they sit you down. I love this place! Definitely my new go to spot for all you can eat. I usually go to Gen BBQ for all you can eat."}
{"text":"Great price, great food.  The appetizer variety is phenomenal! We got steamed egf, corn, tofu soup, seaweed salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, pancake, redbeans, and sardines!! Best selection I have had in Las Vegas!  The meat variety is also awesome. The thin pork belly was bomb! We also tried short ribs, baby octupus, brisket and marinated steak. Everything was well prepared and fresh.   The service was great. Friendly staff.  Also like the interior deco with wood and concrete!! Modern yet down to earth."}
{"text":"The service was fast, however the wait was long even though there were empty tables. Love the brisket, I can eat brisket for days and this place had an amazing brisket"}
{"text":"We're not from here so we went just based on yelp reviews, it was 4 stars and we were tired of driving around... It's a AYCE place with no other Korean food except tofu soup. I got the tofu soup with side of galbi, it was very mediocre. My parents got the all you can eat meats-- bulgogi and spicy pork--they seemed to like that just okay. Minimal side dishes for lunch--none of the sticky rice wrap thingies, no lettuce wraps. They mischarged us so we had to fix that... Otherwise the service was fine. We've only eaten at this Korean establishment in Las Vegas so there's no other places to compare... Maybe for this town this place is fine to go, but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Very good. Has our water and put salad on the table before we even sat. Service was okay there was only three of them and it was pack. Took awhile to get some of the order in but is all worth it. The garlic butter for the meat is a must! Goes great with all the meat!"}
{"text":"i have been here twice within the last several months. 1st time service was great. the young lady we had was friendly and always checking up on us, cleaning the grill, food was coming out pretty quickly. all while it was a weekend.   2nd time was ok. not as busy (on a monday night) and not much service. what also irratated me was the fact i ordered steamed egg and they had the nerve to serve me a burnt one. yes, it was dry and the bottom was black. i should have taken a pic of it but i like to stir my soup when i eat it. it tasted really awful but i still ate it incase they were to charge me extra. why would they even do that? If they knew it was smoking burnt just make a new one geez!  (-1 star) i had to wave at the workers sitting together at the first table by the door to get their attention. i hope i didnt ruin their conversation.  Other than that i like the place. but wish they would give more than 2 strips of pork belly        (-1star). and turn the vent on in there, it did get a little smokey in there."}
{"text":"Our favorite Korean BBQ in Vegas. AYCE. $16.99 for limited options or $19.99 for full menu. Really good food. Very hot in there. Service not so great. We ordered steamed egg like three times before they told us they were out."}
{"text":"Tofu Hut, move aside!  We LOVE this place. The prices are right, the amount of food and the quality of it is amazing.   Food: AWESOME. About $20 a pop for all you can eat. Everything we tried was very good, especially the wine marinated pork belly. They give you a lot of sides as well, and their spicy salad is very comparable to other KBBQ's in the area.  Service: Now this stands out. You will always have someone coming by every few minutes to check on you and make sure you are having a good time. You don't get this at most places, all you get is just a blank nod and the check when you aren't even halfway done.   Parking kind of sucks, especially on peak times, but that's to be expected. Be prepared for dropped suspension neon 1995 Honda's with mufflers the size of a bowling balls roaring here and there though. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher ratings. This is my favorite place in Vegas for Korean BBQ. Good prices (especially the lunch special at $16.99) and feels and tastes much more authentic (unlike Gen). Price includes dessert.  Lots and lots of banchan (side dishes) given. Includes pickled onion, peppers, kimchi, odeng (fish cakes), bean sprouts, radish, and seaweed. Just wish there was macaroni salad.  Appetizer menu is quite large and delicious. Be sure to order the corn cheese and garlic butter to eat with your meats. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) is a crunchy break from the monotony of soft beef and pork. Large meat menu as well, and portions are plenty.  Service is excellent. They come to check on you more than enough times, even during busy lunch hours.   **if the parking lot is full, I usually just park at the church next to the plaza and walk over**"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Don't expect gourmet style AYCE Korean BBQ. They have all the basic meats. Service is slow, not terrible. You get plenty of Korean side dishes, a one time miniature Korean soybean soup and steamed eggs. when I crave BBQ, this is the only place in Vegas I go to."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic for a good price!! Bulgogi and the pork is the way to go hands down hwaro"}
{"text":"Lunch price is cheap at $19.95  The meat tasted good & the service is good.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and absolutely quality meats. Growing up in Koreatown in Los Angeles, CA, I've had sooo many experiences with kbbq and hands down, one of the best AYCE in Las Vegas. Highly recommended. Come through with the come through!  Seated within 5 minutes of arrival, on a late Saturday night during their Late Night special. Truly amazed with the pricing and the vast array of items to choose from.   From side dishes to appetizers to BBQ, you will be walking out with a very fulllllll tummy. Trust me."}
{"text":"Food was ok and a bit expensive.  Went to eat Thursday at 2:00 and four total in our group, myself, wife and two kids 12 and 10.  There is usually a different price for kids but not here and was charged same adult price with automatic tip bill was $113.  Thought we were getting lunch rate but it was explained that since we ordered one plate from all day section all four of us charged higher all day price per person.  Kids barely ate any meat and definitely did not eat $24 of food.  I would have no problem with bill if explained up front so we can be aware instead of end of meal."}
{"text":"I like the porkbelly and the kimchi  thank you for the good service xoxo we will be back soon"}
{"text":"Hwaro is the new kid in one busiest plazas in Chinatown (home to Curry Zen, Raku, etc).   I came with a group of 9 on a Saturday night; there wasn't a table big enough for our party so we split into 2 groups.  It wasn't terribly busy inside, but right from the get-go, service was very spotty.  15 minutes into being seated, our friends who are seated across from us have gotten their drinks and  have started grilling their food while we are still waiting for our server to attend to us.  When our server finally arrived, most of our party was already annoyed and envious of our other companions.  We asked if we could get started right away, but our waitress said she couldn't take our order until she put the grill on (why she couldn't take our order and then put the grill on is beyond me...)  We waited for probably another 5 minutes, but by that time it seemed like an eternity before we were able to order.    We were able to try the pork belly, beef tongue, brisket, wine marinated pork belly, and the one per person dinner items such as baby octopus and enoki beef.  The meat was all very good!  I liked that they weren't overly marinated and I liked that they gave you 2 extra dipping sauces (one is sweet and the other is spicy) along with the traditional sauce of sesame oil with salt and pepper used for pork belly.  We also got a lot of banchan which included kimchi, fishcake, broccoli with a white sauce on top, small fish, apple/egg salad, mussels, corn cheese, and pickled radish.  They also served complimentary bean paste stew, steamed egg, and salad.    Although the food was really good, our server rarely came back to check on us.  And when she did, she never came back with the salad we asked for.  We had to wave down our friend's to ask if their server can help refill our drinks and put in another order.  And as another yelper mentioned, I don't think they change the grills after it becomes charred and nasty.  When it initially started to get black, we wiped the char off with some of the pickled radish so we could continue cooking.  When we were ready for our second order, we asked to change the grill and instead they wiped the grill with a napkin.  At the end of the night we were all full, but with such lackluster service, it's hard to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite Korean BBQ joint. Meat quality is good, staff can be overwhelmed at times but offer exceptional service. Our recent visit today was short due to a unwelcome guest. A live roach was skittering across the wall beside us. The roach made its way to the table near our grill. Our group immediately left the table, after soon losing our appetites. We brought the attention to a nearby staff member who apologized for the inconvenience but could only accommodate us free drinks. We did not finish our meal. The entire situation seemed dismissed and was taken lightly. When speaking to their manager his reply was \"OK\" and did not charge us for \"leftovers\". As a result our group will no longer return this loved place. Very disappointing!...   If you don't mind a potential pest ruining your dinner, this is the place for you. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I recently started going here and the service is amazing with very attentive servers. We had to wait an hour but it was definitely worth it. They however did run out of brisket but that's okay because there were so many options to choose from! We couldn't have possibly gone through them all. Harland (our server) was very helpful with guiding us on what was the best of the best. I will definitely be bring many friends and family here!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better KBBQ places in town! Great staff, great food. We went in on a Wednesday evening (6:30ish?) with a party of 6 and waited about 30-45 minutes for our table. This place always seems to be busy so I wouldn't be surprised if the wait is longer on weekends!  Jitto was our server and he was extremely attentive to our table. We had the AYCEand I definitely think it's sooooooo worth it. The quality of food and the amount of food you get is worth it for the price of AYCE which I think was $21 or $22 - pretty much the same as other KBBQ places I've been to in town. You definitely get your money's worth. The menu has so much to offer but I honestly generally don't get more outside the typical meats - bugolgi, short ribs (my personal fave and it was delish here!), pork belly, beef tongue, beef brisket, etc. so I can't speak to anything else. I can tell you however that the meat I do normally get was really good.  As with most, if not all, Korean dining places, you get the necessary side dishes. We had a table full of them and our server or the busser kept coming to refill that and our water without us even realizing! The salad they provide in the beginning is also yummy and a great starter.  Bonus points: AYCE comes with desert! Their affogato ice cream is yummmy!  Looking for a place to have KBBQ? Hwaro is your best bet. Get your money's worth. Make your tummy happy."}
{"text":"*This review is from a gluten sensitive person so take what you may of it :)  Upon arrival I asked out waitress which items were gluten/soy sauce free and she whipped out a pen and circled all the entree meats that were not marinated in some sort of soy sauce (see photo of menu). Later when they brought out dipping sauces, my boyfriend asked for their main dipping sauce and another waitress kindly warned him that it was made with soy sauce. So the first waitress must have let the other know about our allergy preference, which is sweet (even though my bf can eat gluten). I asked for the salt and pepper sesame oil, and Chile sauce - both gluten friendly.   The meal came and waitresses were attentive, although since they were busy the sauces and sides came out a little slowly. We were in no rush though and it wasn't really all that bad. We ordered brisket (which was a little tough) Also tried the green tea pork belly (not really a noticeable flavor to me), the jalapeno garlic pork belly (Smokey flavor but not much jalepeno and definitely not spicy), pork cheek (pretty good), and beef belly (also good). My bf finished the grill off with some marinated dishes that I was too full to eat anyway (which when ordered, the waitress kindly reminded us again were marinated dishes). He got spicy skirt steak and bulgogi which he said were \"really good.\" He also got a #25 (\"The shit\") which was like a fried jalapeno popper with a chesey mayo teryaki sauce. He said it definitely earns its name.  Unlimited refills on side dishes including kimchi (questionable on gluten so I passed), potato salad, sweet chile cucumbers, radish, marinated onion (not gf), fish cake (not gf), and salad that had a sweet vinegar dressing I was fine with.  For dessert you also get a free ice cream (I told you it's worth the money!) We each ordered the affogato. Unfortunately for celiac or gluten sensitive people, it comes with some kind of honey-bunches-of-oats on top (most likely not gluten free) but I let the waitress know and she apologized and quickly got me a new one without the toppings.   For what you get, this place is really worth the price. The food quality isn't like wagyu beef status but it is pretty darn good. We never ran out of water or had anyone ignore our table of 2 despite the busy lunch hour. Free sides and delicious ice cream at the end to top it all off. Can't complain about anything honestly but if i were to improve the place, I would mark the gluten free items on the menu.  5 stars for this place considering price, food quality and options, allergy accommodations, and service. Would definitely visit again when craving kbbq."}
{"text":"First off, i usually have pretry low expectations whenever i go to an AYCE korean BBQ place. Especially for $21.95. For that price i expect massive amounts of pork belly and thin sliced brisket. This place goes above and beyond when it comes to selection. They serve a nicely marinated skirt steak, a whole 8oz ribeye steak,( nicely marbled btw), pork cheeks, beef tongue, pork intestine, thin sliced ribeye, as well as many different versions of pork belly. They have both the rice wraps and pickled daikon wraps....very L.A. indeed. The miso soup and egg souffle were both great as well. I definitely felt like i got my moneys worth. Service was also on point."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here  The food is amazing   My favorite is the green tea pork belly  It's a small place  But the atmosphere is friendly"}
{"text":"Wow I love the selection here. The premium steak is delicious. I also like the decor of the place. I'd suggest coming early though as the line does get long around dinner time."}
{"text":"Tried plenty of Korean BBQ all you can eat places and this one is def one of the top it has so much variety plenty of choices...Plus they have dessert after included!"}
{"text":"Like they say, there's no \"i\" in team!  For the first time I actually had quality service at a Korean BBQ spot. I know, I know it's hard to believe, right?! Not only did my hostess serve us, but just about every other employee stopped by at least once to make sure we didn't need to put in any more orders or replace our grill which was swapped out 3 times. Splendid job, guys!  Highly recommend spending the extra $3 for the additional special meats you get to choose from. On a scale from 1-10, we devoured the following: Korean Fried Chicken 7  Spicy Skirt Steak 7 Brisket 8 Green Tea Smoked Pork Belly 10 Sliced Rib Eye x2 (their version of bulgogi) 10 Hanjungsal (pork cheek) 7 Beef Tongue 6 Short Ribs 10  Red Wine Pork Belly 9 Hwaro Premium Steak 3 Enoki Beef 8 Baby Octopus 7 Green Tea Ice Cream 7 Affogato 10  The only piece of meat I was upset about was the biggest and baddest looking Hwaro Premium Steak! I babysat and cooked that beauty to my favorite/perfect temperature of medium rare just to find out it wasn't as premium as they made it sound. On top of that, they only allowed one per table when the menu says per person. We were the first two guests to be seated upon openning and their Shake Shake Rice was not available yet. (fail much?) On a few occasions I also ran into tiny pieces of bone grinding between my teeth during my meat buffet breakdown.  This is the place to be if you enjoy unlimited amounts of protein for a good price. Their restaurant ambiance is very welcoming, spacious, and most of all, clean!  I'll see you guys here soon;)  PS: Jump on the Chum Churum Peach Sake! #delicious"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ outside of Southern California!!! Our group makes sure to come at least once a week. Get the marinated ribeye with melted butter!"}
{"text":"First time coming to a Korean BBQ joint closest to the West Coast and it did not disappoint. I guess it is true that Asian foods is better and cheaper in the West.   The choices of meats and appetizers were endless which it could easily cost $28 per person back home in the East Coast. All the meats we tried were not too fatty, very fresh and tasteful. Their Hwaro Premium steak was a surprised our party since we received a big slab of ribeye!! I like how the buffet includes dessert but too bad it is only one order per guest. Also, their banchan was yummy especially their kimchi. Though watch out for the seafood salad (mixed/diced raw fish) if you have a soft stomach; it arrived room temperature though raw fish should arrive to our table cold.      Minus 1 star for their service. A few employees in their were not friendly looking. Seems like they are carrying an attitude. I feel like the restaurant is small so they do not really have a main waiter/waitress. One of the waiter was outstanding though. Also, they do not cook the meats on the grill for you-- you have to do it on your own. I am not sure if this is a West Coast thing or they do help you out but our table did not get that treatment. At least, the estimated waiting time I was told for my table was on point! I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"My fave bbq! Skirt steak, bulgogi, chicken, the shit! Lunch $17.95! Also great service!"}
{"text":"Not bad, Hwaro!   I'll be honest, the first time I came to Hwaro I left before ordering... Due to an \"unfortunate circumstance\" they were not serving any alcohol. I was with two of my Korean friends who wanted soju and were very disappointed they couldn't order alcohol. We left and ventured off to Woonamjung's further down Spring Mountain for AYCE KBBQ and multiple bottles of soju.  I was bummed about leaving because I've been wanting to try Hwaro and heard nothing but good things from my Korean coworkers. I finally tried Hwaro this week and was not disappointed!   The salad that comes with the KBBQ tasted average. On the other hand, the banchan was on point! Pretty tasty! A nice variety of side dishes were provided and the servers were nice about replenishing them when requested.   Servers came by our table frequently - at least 4 different people visited throughout our dinner. They were fantastic and quickly fulfilled our requests (water, sauces, additional side dishes, etc). We were never waiting and they even came by to change out our grill.   For meat, I'm all about the brisket and don't crave anything else (kalbi, bulgogi, pork belly, etc). My friend I was with ordered all sorts of meat selections ranging from cuts of flank steak, intestine, to pork skin. I enjoyed the brisket... It was fatty (which I ate around) but also very tender. The flank was great and the intestine was interesting. I didn't try the pork skin but my friend enjoyed it. I also didn't try any of the marinated meat so unfortunately I can't speak for the kalbi or bulgogi.   Hwaro gets 4 stars from me. The banchan and prompt service gets a 5. Both were much better than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ restaurants I've been to in the city. The meat gets a 3.5. I enjoyed my experience at Hwaro and would definitely consider coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for bigger parties. We had a group of 8 and they were able to accommodate just fine! We had tons of fun and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Love the nostalgia this place gives me of my time living in Korea! Great price for the authentic food!"}
{"text":"Hwaro has been our go to Korean BBQ spot for sometime now as they are always on point. From the meat to the fixins including the apps, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Service is solid as well but make sure you know what you want to order beforehand as they can get annoyed if you take too long to order. Try the KFC, it's delish."}
{"text":"Favorite KBBQ spot! The meat is flavorful and the service is quick. The all you can eat selections are generous."}
{"text":"The service was good and the price is cheaper than most other Korean BBQ places. There is also a late night special where it is even cheaper.   There is a good variety of food for what you pay for and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Harland is the best server always smiling...always happy love the brisket...green pork belly!!yum yum"}
{"text":"I can't believe it. I'm travelling alone and wanted to eat kbbq.As i was looking online  for a place to eat, I saw this restaurant and decided to go. I decided to walk from my friends house going to hwaro for about 2.5 miles but when I get there, they wouldn't let me eat cause it's minimum of 2 persons for you to eat their AYCE. I mean, I was so hungry and walked for almost an hour and they won't let me eat. Definitely a no!"}
{"text":"Probably not the best choice in the heat of summer, but none the less the food and service were great.  at $19.99 you can't beat the price for AYCE Korean BBQ.  The meat was fresh and well seasoned and the side dishes (my personal fave) were all authentic and fresh as well.  The server changed out our grill frequently and even dealt with our multiple requests to lower or higher the heat (we just couldn't get that perfect temp where the meat cooks evenly and charr's the outside).  While I don't claim to know much about Korean food, I feel like I can give this a great rating."}
{"text":"So good for the price you get, good service, friendly atmosphere. and just overall good food. it's the same owner as the neko sushi spot i wrote a review about a while ago. Nothing was out of place at that restaurant. good for date night or a few friends to go with. the really good meats are for the all day menu but i just went with the lunch. so i have yet to try the all day portion of the menu. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place, near kung fu tea and has great service. I had the dinner menu and got quality meat. I love eating kbbq so this was a great spot for after a hike. I will most definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Service was extremely quick and food was good. Only issue was their rice paper was very dry."}
{"text":"The salt n oil sauce was amazing!!  The fish cake was super delicious.   This place does not have rice paper"}
{"text":"KBBQ DONE RIGHT  I mean you cant really mess it up right?! Late night special at $20 for AYCE!!! Deals! We were bored at hoke so why not eat out?! Got here around 1230a, last call is at 2.  Party of 4 took about 10 minutes to be sat because there was quite an amount of peeps here.  For appetizers we got The Shit, Padak, and Steamed Egg.  These were a part of the AYCE.  We ordered various meats that came to our table fast.  The service here was really straight to the point, i love it.  The meats were really good.  We got brisket, tongue, kalbi bone in, garlic jalapeno belly, premium steak, and other meats that I didnt know about.  We lasted about only 2 rounds. Sad lol.  But i enjoyed my experience. We also got the affogato ice cream.  Wish it had more affogato in it but thats okay it was good.  The music here was lit. Couldnt stop dancing in my chair. LOL."}
{"text":"Great food great service. If your looking for tasty korean BBQ this is the place. It's worth the wait . So get your belly ready and enjoy"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect except for the long wait. But then most good restaurants are like that. Service was amazing, food was tasty, 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place,  good luck finding parking sometimes though. It's ayce kbbq, no surprises, pricing is avg  and food is good.  Where's all the damn rice paper in this town???!!! Only reason I'm giving 4 not 5 stars."}
{"text":"This korean bbq place is great! A lot of options available and the quality of the food is superb! This is my second time here and I will continue to come to this place whenever I'm in Vegas!  I highly recommend this place if you want something different from the restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"By far the best korean bbq place! Hands down! You don't even need to ask, the server we had would often check if we were doing fine and made sure that our grill was being changed so it wasn't burnt. The price is definitely worth it especially with the mountain of food they give you. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We were here to have meats,,, yes, meats and very satisfied with the quality of foods and services. Especially, our server Janice was a very professional. She was super busy but she was VERY attentive, smiling to every customer & table she was in charge of. THANK U VERY MUCH, Janice!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is so delicious. Meat comes out quick and the selection is pretty good. Music selection is randomly played in the background and seats are limited so come early to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it for the food and price! Sides are on the table just as we get seated. Quick staff and can't beat a free beer!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple nights ago, heard that this was a new korean BBQ place we had to try it out. When we got there, there was barely any wait and there was 2 of us. Sat down at the large table cause they're were no smaller ones which was fine. We drank the tea water and it was okay for what's suppose to be like an iced tea it was very watered down so I was a bit disappointed in that and I didn't like the fact that they charged us for it when most places don't. Appetizers were good, loved the salad. When we ordered the first bunch of meat they gave us a platter of everything we order but in kind of small portions and when we reordered something they gave us a lot of that one order. So it didn't make sense to me to give us little of everything then give us a lot later. Everything on the grill looked great, even the pork belly was thicker than what I've usually have seen which didn't really bother me because it was good but all the meats they gave us were chewy. Tasted good but really chewy. They open till late at night so that's a plus but it wouldn't be my first Korean BBQ choice."}
{"text":"Great food and good portions. It's also reasonably priced as far as Korean BBQ goes. Definitely recommend it! They don't do same day reservations though and get pretty busy, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite ayce Korean BBQ in Las Vegas. Good selections and open until 3. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Went with a few of my coworkers after work. Food was alright. Ive been to other ayce places and there was more meat varieties so i guess im spoiled with having a larger selection of meats."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Hwaro. Whether it's to end the night or go to lunch, their all-you-can-eat menu is beyond delicious. Enough flavors to leave you satisfied on many different levels. Can't wait to visit again soon."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is good!! all you can eat for $20!! yep will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Checking out this new KBBQ with Co-Workers!!! So far great place... clean, friendly, great location & great food options!! I would definitely recommend it for groups!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait for the long line at Caesar's buffet. Thought we give this ACYE a try.   Food - average. Flavor is not bad but can be better.   Short rib - definitely can use more flavor. It's cut too thick. Average quality.   Beef belly - pretty good. A bit fatty.   Brisket - my least favorite. Quality is ehh.   Fat ass (yes, that's the name) - it's basically a very fatty thick cut pork belly marinated in a wine sauce. Kinda bland. Very fatty. Ehh.   Steam eggs - complimentary. We ordered this when we ordered our food but they must have forgotten. We had to ask mid way through our dinner n didn't receive it till all of our food was cooked. Would have loved this to help balance our fatty meal. Flavor was good. Very eggy. Egg ratio was higher than the broth.   Banchan - ehh. Very average. U get about 8 or so banchan with ur meal + a salad. Soy bean soup is also included but we never got ours.   Cleanliness - yikes. This is where we had a problem. We sat at the corner table. There was a live roach flipped on its back with the legs still moving. Strike 1. Went to the ladies room to freshen up before our meal. There was another roach (see photo)!! Strike 2. Hence the 2 stars. Against our better judgement we still ate here!! We were staving. Don't judge me.   Service - we were basically served by one guy the whole time. I think his name is Angover. Yes, it sounds like hangover which is why we remembered the name.  He was very attentive n made sure to check on us even though we were dumped in a corner like a bad habit by the elder Korean lady (there were other tables available when we arrived). He also seemed to be the only one working hard.   Overall food was ok. Service was great. We're so spoiled by all the amazing ACYE back in LA.   Happy wasting ur money on mediocre KBBQ!!"}
{"text":"Busy Korean style BBQ restaurant. Great foods. Meats are really fresh. Will come back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for quite a while now, so I decided now is the best time to finally make a review.  Food is great & they have such a wide selection of appetizer & meat, so be sure to have an empty stomach before coming in here! I love their red wine pork belly, as well as their skirt steak.  Their customer service, however, is such a hit or miss. The past three visits for me has been such a disappointment. I understand if it's a busy night & all, but to forget an order & not checking in if we need water? It was annoying, but it's good that they were checking in on other customers except us  We had no water, empty plates were piling up, being gone for most of our dinner, & having to find you = not acceptable in my book. But thank you for your quick service as soon as we asked for dessert."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas! Come here all the time. Big variety of meats, appetizers, and desserts to choose from. Good price too!"}
{"text":"My favorite Korean BBQ place. Food is great and not that pricey either. The wait can be a little long depending on the day and time so try not to go at a peak time if you don't want to wait"}
{"text":"Good food!! Tried peach flavored soju for the first time omg is was tasty. We ate so much there, all you can eat prices wasn't bad at all either. Will definitely stop there again when we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"I would say one of the better kbbq spots in comparison with other spots in Vegas. No where else.  Positives:  -Fresh meat -Recommend: Skirt steak. Juicy, even when cooked medium well. -Variety of appetizers: -Kfc chicken was my favorite  -\"The shit\" was a second runner up. I'm not quite sure what it was that they put inside but I believe it was some type of meat or shrimp since it tastes similar to fried seaweed shrimp rolls they have at many dim-sum place  -Food quality matches the price, we paid about $22 each (which is still a little much) for a party of 7.   Negatives: -Just like many Korean bbq places: Service. -They closed down the kitchen, without giving us last call. Made us disappointed because my boyfriend was unable to get ice cream & I did 5 minutes before him. Also because it was only 1AM & they close @ 3AM. Sucks. -Includes gratuity for parties of 4 or more. -Very unfortunate that they didn't nail the brisket. -They also don't carry brisket sauce.  -Many of the appetizers included on the menu that we wanted, (brisket nachos & I forgot the other one) they didn't have. -Also didn't have the other ice cream flavors listed on the menu, only green tea. -They don't have an extensive menu for the \"special\" menu. I.E: Beef tongue only included for lunch.  Overall, 3/5 experience. They should look into telling customers what they do & do not have before ordering."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been here once before and loved it so he decided that I also needed to go. All around awesome experience. There was about a 15 minute wait because of a large table but it wasn't bad at all.  The host was super nice and kept us updated on how much longer it would be. Considering it was about 615 pm I'm surprised we didn't have a longer wait. Our server was Hannah and she was too cute for words. Extremely nice, had great recommendations and checked on us frequently. I also love the decor. It's $22 for all you can eat meats and we tried a ton. My favorites were the mussels and jalapeño beef (I think that's what it was.) My boyfriend liked the skirt steak and the Kim chi cucumbers. We both loved the spicy octopus! I also had the egg rolls which were yummy! Hannah recommended the shit and it was awesome too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. One of the best all you can eat places.  Be prepared for a wait to be seated tho. Always busy. Usually a 30 minute to an hour or so wait. And they don't do reservations."}
{"text":"Great deal for AYCE Korean BBQ!! But lacked service...  They only had one server doing literally everything and we had to ask for everything from drinks, to our orders, and condiments..   My HANGRY belly took over and I wasn't as impressed but the meats were delicious cooked MY WAY!  Give it a try if you want to pay less than the other Korean BBQ in LV but just come prepared for a longer stay than expected."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times total, and its always a great experience. The staff are friendly and the food is amazing. Only criticism i have is for them to add Japchae to the menu! Other than that, i love coming here."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeee their beef tongue, enoki, premium steak, tripe, and whatever else I order. The waiters were nice and friendly :)  I like dancing in my chair to the music being played in the background while I eat haha  It's just super packed here all the time! Other than that- good atmosphere and yummy food."}
{"text":"Want to get good services and ayce KBBQ? Come down here and try it out. Your taste buds going to have an orgasim from all the meat and sides."}
{"text":"TL:DR - Good food, fast service, but weird restaurant.  Dinner is around $25 after tips, no reservations taken.  I would come here if you have 2-3 hours for a meal as the wait itself is always over a hour long after their restaurant has filled up. The restaurant itself has a weird layout as a third of their tables have no grills on them, making them useless in a KBBQ establishment. Also, the past couple of times I ate there, I was seated nearest to the kitchen/ and the pathway to the restroom. The stench of commercialized sanitizer was very overbearing to a point where it was slightly unappetizing. If you can, please try to sit as far away from that as possible.   Service is brisk like most KBBQs. Food items come out quickly.   Onto the food, this place is a very solid AYCE KBBQ, their selections are fresh and they try with different marinades for some meats such as pork bellies and chicken. Their beef belly is a fresh slab of beef 'bacon' and is highly flavorful. The BABY OCTOPUS is definitely a highlight if you like that sort of thing. They also have your typical frozen thin sliced meats such as beef brisket and tongue. The appetizers are AYCE as well, and they have a couple good selections on there such as \"KFC\" and \"the shit\", mostly fried food. The banchan includes your typical selections one would find at KBBQs, nothing extravagant. Steam egg was slightly burnt every time i go, which is unfortunate (yes you can burn steamed egg).  Overall I would return, however just be prepared to wait 2-3 hours and if friends were to visit town, they would probably want to spend their time elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went to Hwaro for dinner last night..The food was descent..You don't have a large variety of items like other AYCE Korean BBQ. The service was mediocre. We did get our food pretty fast but the servers were like robots. No one ever smiled. Not sure if we would go back unless they were the only AYCE BBQ around."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend originally planned to have ramen over at Monta, but there was a long wait and we're not a fan of waiting. We went next door which is Hwaro and decided to do ayce korean bbq instead. They asked me to sign and write how many party.   It is a small korean joint, seems like it can seat about 50? We were the only one who's on the wait list. We waited about 15mins or so. We were seated and ban chan was already served on the table. Everything was fine, from kim chi to mashed potatoes but fish cakes (which is my favorite!!) and bean sprouts were a little too salty!!! Eeeek!  The meats were good and perfectly marinated! Squid is good too!   Service is friendly! No complaints. Although our order of rice took a little longer to be served since the waitress forgot about it. So when she passed our table again, i asked for the rice, and she was like \"oh yes!\" But thats ok. They were busy and sometimes that happens! :)   Overall experience was good! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars very often but this place was good.  Now I am battling a cold and my taste buds are a lil slow but man this place was good.  Came for lunch so there was no wait(other Yelp reviews say its crazy busy).  The Meat The Meat The Meat.....keep bringing it!  I have never done the Korean BBQ thing but I was impressed.  Our serever Jasmin was very helpful on explaining what everything was......she recommonded the tounge but maybe if I did several shots of sake maybe I could give it a try......Hit this place up......I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is open late & the quality of food is pretty good. It's a good price for AYCE. Their service got a lot better too. From the time we come in to put our name on the paper to the time we left, it was great! We got what we needed right away. The only downfall is the wait time. It's like super long. But, that just means that it's good.   Get the shake shake rice! & the SHIT. They're good."}
{"text":"ALL EATERS BEWARE! having eating a lot of K-BBQ across my travel and in the bay area, this place is THE WORST OF THE WORST!  My partner and I fly from S.F to Vegas at midnight. Both of us were craving for K-BBQ. It was my first big meal of the day ( i ate some snacks ), and was my partner 3 meals of the day. Needless to said both of us were starving hippos. There were plenty of parking considering it is in a small plaza.   Our waitress was very attentitive, hence the 1 star. She explains the different choices and pricing. We chose the higher prices for more items selections. Big mistakes, because after 10 minutes of eating... everything was pretty much concluded  to 3 flavors : blend, oily and korean chilly peppers paste.   We ordered 5 dishes: pork belly, skirt steak, beef tongues, octopus and tripes. Neither of us could finish them all. And thank god we didn't otherwise both of us would face an even higher potential serious health issues.   I left the restaurant thinking i would give them a second chance to redeem themselves. But after BOTH of us spending hours running to the toilets and me experiencing excruciating stomach pain for two days. I AM SCARED of this place and will NOT BE coming back!! No $20+ worth of food is going to compensate our health."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to have yakiniku Korean bbq for the price to go all you can eat. Just get there early because the line can get busy real quick and the line gets long."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so good! The selections are great and the prices are very nice! Come early and expect a bit of a wait because it's so popular."}
{"text":"Even if you see empty tables, expect a little bit of a wait because they actually set your table complete with all the banchan before you sit down.  I actually really liked that.  The meat is pretty good.  Unfortunately when we asked for seconds of two of the items, they gave us seconds of everything AND in bigger portions than the first time so we couldn't try anything else.  It was good, but we would have liked to try a few more things.    The shake shake rice was very good.  Highly recommended.    Table wasn't too clean, but it's Korean BBQ so it's oily.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"There's always a thing on Korean bbq that the service is lacking.  Aside from that the food here is probably the best in town for me, not because of the cheap price.  My bestfriends and i ate here last week. About 15 minute wait to get sited at 1am.  Ordered pork belly, jalapeño meat, (so yummy) , rib eye steak , etc  Tofu, bulgogi nachos, the shit, corn and cheese   And the vanilla with coffee ice cream.  Will diff go back once we crave for kbbq again."}
{"text":"BEST KBBQ experience ever. There was no wait for us on a Saturday night for the $20 AYCE dinner. The atmosphere was nice, and the service was impeccable! Here's my pluses 1. Banchan was fresh, delicious, and abundant (we never had to ask for refills, not even for water since they gave us two small pitchers for our table already)  2. The waiters/waitress were constantly changing our grill (we had 4 grill changes) without us asking 3. AYCE includes the appetizers as well as ice cream for desert (green tea or vanilla)  4. THEY HAD RICE PAPER! I've gone to a couple KBBQ places that no longer serve the rice paper and it's so disappointing because we love it!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!   The staff here is overly nice. Food is always good and they have a decent beer selection.   Cheese corn is to die for! A must try!"}
{"text":"Will not seat/serve one person. Food: i don't know, they would not let me eat there Parking lot decent size but full Inside: dining area clean Restroom: semi clean but large with a shelf for your purse, that's great!   Don't think it's right you can't eat here if you are by yourself??"}
{"text":"Yummy sides with a lot of variety!!! With free drink when you leave a review on yelp!!! With over 45 choices with the lunch special! Will definitely go back with my friends!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Korean BBQ in town. Food is good. Our least favorite thing is the sweet and spicy tofu. It's BLAND! I used to like beef tongue, but not anymore. They give you a lot of that. A plate full beef tongue. Their bulgogi meat is tasty. Ribeye, spicy skirt steak, enoki beef, beef flank, the shit are in my short list next time.   Service is good. They will come and take your order when you are about to run out of food. They also change your grill very often. There is a limit of 90 minutes though.   There is always a line, 20-45 minutes depending on what time you are there. Parking is a pain. It's in the same shopping center with Raku, monta ramen and Kung Fu tea, and the parking lot is tiny, so if you're lucky, you'll get one there, otherwise, just park on the street and in the other parking lot across the street (only at night time)."}
{"text":"Get here at opening time if you don't want to wait, re place is small and a a wait list builds up emquickly! Once you are seated, service is polite and prompt. Octopus was among my fav with the tasty side dishes!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. My servers name was hichiemi I think. We came in around 1:00 and he was great. There was another server that was helping him and she was also great but I didn't get her name. This my new favorite Korean bbq place. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This all you can eat korean yakiniku buffet is awesome. The meat quality is great and the price is super cheap. I found myself eating just the right amount compared to other buffets, where you have to stuff your stomach to get your monies worth."}
{"text":"My usual spot for my boyfriend and I. The service has gotten so much better and our usual server david provides outstanding service. You can never get tired of the all you can eat menu. Theres also a free dessert of your choice at the end. Overall, its a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We eat at this place all the time and we are never disappointed! Definitely a place to try if you're vacationing here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Having lunch with my BF here. The environment here is nice. The price is good $20.95 for over 52 items! Meat quality is jjang! staff is kind. highly recommended"}
{"text":"This the place if you need a Korean BBQ fix. Go with the brisket, the bulgogi nachos are excellent as well. Staff very friendly, great see Action for all you can eat, always crowded but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. 2nd time in one week. I decided to take my Dad here for Father's Day. He thought it was delicious. Note: He has been to Korea and ate bbq there. I've eaten at numerous places in LA and happy to finally find a place where it reminds me of K town. Only complaint why no Hite beer? Although Cass is pretty tasty too. The service could use a lil improvement,  but when I did ask for something etc.. everyone was very nice."}
{"text":"Got here at 2p and seated 230p. Went to restroom and was slipped. The floor was extremely wet and luckily I didn't Crack my head lol. Anyhow service was subpar. After being seated we waited for almost 10 minutes before waiter came to get our order. When he came to take it, we told him we never received menus so we didn't know how it worked or what to eat so he returned with the menus. We ordered and our Foo came out after about 20 minutes. We had to ask for oil and salt because they forgot that too and they apologized. They were very friendly but just busy and forgetful. Food was awesome and on point, just slow service. When we left it was almost 430p...dinner prices .. reasonable but we went in for lunch and it ended up being longer than what we expected but food was very good and they were nice people..just slow ..so if you have patience the food is worth the wait .. even though I fell and hurt my leg because of their wet floors on the way to wash my hands ane slow service they recvd a great tip for outstanding food AND SMILES haha..."}
{"text":"This korean bbq place is very FANTASTIC! No word could explain their service, their food and the friendliness of staff despite of so many request from our table, their affogato is fantastic!!!! I can not wait to come back and try their fantastic food once again, we are very well taken care of! Once you get inside you will be happy when you are done! Excellent!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for Korean BBQ.   it good  it nice  it dope  it fresh  it tasty  it clean  and it good"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today, and it's definitely my favourite Korean BBQ in Las Vegas. The quality of the food was fantastic and there were so many options with meats, sides, appetizers and even desserts!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Hobak but I decided to try an all you can eat KBBQ spot.  My friend always goes to this joint so I decided to tag along.  All you can eat is $23 bucks and you really can't find a better deal.  The quality of meat isn't as good as Hobak but what would one expect with it being all you can eat.  Everything we ordered was really good especially the beef belly & the short rib.  Their service is stupid fast, they come around and ask if you want more and it literally comes out within a couple minutes.    Their garlic butter is super good, especially after you let the garlic boil in the butter.  The texture is similar to like a soft potato LOL.    I'd definitely come here when I'm feeling extra hungry and don't want to do a la carte.   4 stars because the steamed egg was a little watery & quality of meat was decent."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Korean BBQ place in town.Huge variety of meet no limit of side dishes.Amazing atmosphere and great customer service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for some yummy juicy AYCE Korean barbeque. Plenty of tables when we arrived and was sat down immediately.  Server that served us was really nice. Asked us what drinks we want and came back with it quite quickly. The menu simple and easy to read and ordered a few appetizers such as seaweed salad and the sh*t  both dishes was delicious. Highly recommend trying the sh*t.  Ordered a few plates of meat and it cooked on our grill at a fair amount of time. The amount of meat they gave us each time was decent and the wait time for the next plate balanced out our eating time.  They also offer dessert here and we ordered a bowl of ice cream. I appreciate how this place offers appetizers, main course and dessert with a price of one AYCE.   This is probably one of my favorite AYCE Kbbq place because of the price, the marinated meat and the dessert."}
{"text":"I love going here! There's just something about their meat that makes it so good. They have a great selection & their brisket sauce is amazing. They also include sides & dessert with AYCE.  The only downsides are that it's always packed & they have slow service, which means we have to wait 30 min. to 1 hour & 30 min. & I have waited that long because the food is worth the wait. This is not a place to go to if you're in a time crunch.  This is also not a place to go to for large groups. You'd wait longer & you may even be split up."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out this KBBQ spot for a while now because there always seems to be a line out the door whenever I see it across the street from when I visit Snowflake Shavery.  It wasn't very busy when we arrived and had about 3 parties ahead of us waiting for a table. The greeters were very short and told us to sit down at what already looked like a table where we would be eating so it seemed unclear as to whether we were waiting for service or just a table.  We waited about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and we were ushered to our table. Our waiter was very nice and checked on us fairly often. The food was great. The marination and flavor of the meats were great and the selection of the appetizers were numerous. The chicken was so soft and melted in my mouth. When I asked for a refill of the fish cakes, I got a plate double the size of the original filled with fish cake.   Great spot for the food, but I don't think I would come back here considering how long I would have to wait. There are plenty of other Korean BBQ places I could go to with a significantly shorter wait time and better service."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas about a year ago, and have always had a thing for Korean BBQ. I recently discovered this place , and it not only exceeded my expectations, but it blew them off of this planet. I definitely recommend this place, and this place beats the place I always used to go to in San Diego. If I could give it 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"My friends are raving about Hwaro, plus yelpers are creating a buzz about this place. I haven't really had a good korean restaurant in Vegas, which is why I checked this place out.   We came around 9p, didnt have issues with the wait time. We ordered the AYCE- pork belly, beef sirloin and ribs. Our orders came with steamed egg, rice and typical banchan.   I was very disappointed :( i was expecting the sweet, salty and spicy contrast of korean food but everything was plain and flat. I wouldn't go back even when I am badly craving for korean bbq."}
{"text":"I've been several times now, great selection, good quality and a good price. Recommend going for lunch, I went late night once it was almost a hour wait which was expected but service was lacking. I know our server had his hands full with all the other tables but that's not an excuse."}
{"text":"One of the better value/quality to variety ratio for korean bbq! A small restaurant but well themed. It almost feels like you are in Asia rather than las vegas! This place offers tapas as well with fusion dishes. Pretty cleanfor what it is. I recommend this place and will continue coming back to satisfy that korean bbq cravings!"}
{"text":"Beats Tofu Hut in many many ways! First let me just say Tofu Hut was good, but Hwaro was BETTER.  First of all it's much cleaner. They have a bigger selection of meats and more sides. The only thing not better was the sweet and spicy pork. Tofu Hut still has that. The service at Hwaro is friendlier. No rude servers and every time you order something new it's brought out right away and they change your grill out with a clean one.  So far this Hwaro will be our go to Korean BBQ.  I highly recommend this place! It's a few dollars more but worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, ventilation is great, liked \"the shit\", thanls to our waitress for recommending it"}
{"text":"I can't believe they raised their price so much!  $19.95+tax per person for lunch speciall; from $16.95!!     Although this is only slightly above the ayce average, their meat is slightly below average. They have moved tripe from lunch to all day special:(  With this price, I can get a decent kbbq at hobak, magal, or gangnam with few extra bucks    I'm going to look for a different place to do Kbbq."}
{"text":"Came once with my girlfriend for a valentine's diner and we fell in love with the food and side dishes. We have come back as often with friends while enjoying a nice night out."}
{"text":"When you take food quality, cleanliness, and price into consideration, I consider Hwaro as the best AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant in Vegas. Since they first opened, I visited this place quite a few times and always walked out feeling happy and satisfied (and super heavy from all the food I ate.. LOL) In the past, I would visited Sura but it seemed that while their price kept going up ($28 the last time I visited), Sura's food quality and cleanliness went downhill. Unless things change in the future, this is the place I will go for KBBQ craving."}
{"text":"A BBQ place where I need to wait at least 20minutes every time. But it is worth to wait. The food is so good. BTW, short rib is my favor"}
{"text":"Hwaro offers a wide selection of meats and appetizers, but small details and inefficient service prevent this KBBQ place from reaching 5 stars!  Hwaro offers over 52 items for the All Day Special and for only $20.95, this is an amazing deal. The All Day Special includes the Hwaro Premium Steak; the best item on the whole menu. The steak is fresh and if cooked properly, it is the juiciest and most tender piece of meat on the menu. Other items on the All Day Special include Enoki beef, baby octopus, and the spicy pineapple beef steak. All of which are amazing.   Besides these specialty items, Hwaro also offers the KBBQ staples like bulgogi, pork belly, skirt steak, and brisket. To be honest, these staples are great, but they're not amazing. They taste like every other KBBQ place, which is definitely not a bad thing. A few items that I rarely see at KBBQ places are the tripe and the pork skin. These were surprisingly good, especially when they're almost borderline burnt. Both were crispy, fatty, and full of flavor.   As for the appetizers, I would recommend getting the cheese fondue, the corn cheese, the garlic butter, and the shake shake rice. I typically don't see these appetizers on very many KBBQ restaurants, so I decided to try them. The fondue and the corn cheese paired well with anything that was spicy, as it cut the heat with fat, and the garlic butter is a must with the Premium Steak!   As for the service, it was only okay. I've definitely had better, but I've also had worse. My main problem with the service is that they would forget some of our appetizers, even when asked multiple times. I asked for seaweed salad twice during my visit, and I never got it. Service also seemed a little slow (maybe it was because there were only two or three? waiters/waitresses during lunch). I would ask for other appetizers, and they would come 10 to 15 minutes later. The same thing goes for the side dishes, but the wait was not as long. Finally, although the service for the meat itself was quick, we were bombarded with all of the meat at once, even if the orders at our table were not finished yet. To be fair, this is a good thing, but it made it hard to eat/enjoy the food when our party had to constantly shuffle plates to make room for everything. So the experience made it a little overwhelming and cramped.   Speaking of cramped, it was extremely difficult to get in and out of our table. Our table was one of the larger tables in the middle of the restaurant, and I will warn you right now: those benches do not move, and there is very little space to get in and out. It's not really a problem once you've seated, but if you need to use the bathroom a lot like me, it gets pretty difficult to maneuver. And it's a hassle for everyone on that side of the bench. Also, the waiting area to get seating is very small. Expect to stand outside if you are coming during dinner or busy hours.    Overall, Hwaro has one of the most diverse meat and appetizer selections I've seen in terms of KBBQ. I would definitely recommend this place and the Premium Steak. Although the service isn't the best, and although there were other small problems, it doesn't take away from the fact that the food is excellent! I will definitely be back!    ***Side note: If you review them on Yelp, you can get a soft drink or beer for FREE! I recommend writing a short review, then you can just edit the review later***"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite KBBQ. The wait is a bit longer than Tofu Hut, but it's definitely worth the cleanliness, service, and food!! I'm usually with my party of 3-4 and we usually wait about 45 minutes to an hour. It's so good and so worth it though. My favorite meats are brisket and beef tongue, I would also recommend \"The Shit\" which is a delicious shaked rice with kimchi and egg. My favorite place ever next to Gen, 10/10!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Late night griLLing|grub sesh after waLking the strip. Good reviews on YeLp and them cLosing at 3AM made this a no-brainer. [AYCE was the cherry ontop!!!]   Our party of two arrived @ about 1:35 and was toLd that Last caLL was at 2AM. WompWompWomp.  At this time in the night and due to the hangry-ness that was kicking in, we gave it a go anyhow and just hoped for the best.  Jayden was our server and he was poLite and extremeLy patient. I urged my man to just order an ish-Load of food and caLL it a night since we were given such a smaLL time constraint. Our server kindLy stepped in and mentioned that we were free to order whatever we wanted but there wouLd be a charge at the end with whatever food was Left over [keep this in mind peopLe].  The banchan came out first and aLthough everything was good, the fish cake (which is normaLLy my fave) was simpLy ok and there was no japchae offered [Boooooo!!!!].  That being said, the other foods that came out were AMAZING. Meats were weLL marinated and I didn't need any dipping sauces. The absoLute highLight of the night were the buLgogi and Korean ribs.   We'LL make a trip back, especiaLLy to try the Affogato ice cream with Korean coffee.  (We were bummed to find out that this item was incLuded in the \"Last CaLL\" notice too). UntiL next time Hwaro....."}
{"text":"Been there 5 times, and would go back again!  Good cuts of meat compared to the price, and a friendly atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"this is probably the best food we ever had. i will jave it again. thank you korean. service is perfect. they are nice and bringning the foid quantity. my favorite is skirt steak."}
{"text":"Very good quality meat and very friendly staff! Highly recommended:) It's very popular so plan for some waiting time."}
{"text":"Hwaro is usually my go-to place for KBBQ. I have been to Hwaro many times due to their exceptional service and amazing food at a good price. However, my friend and I saw that in one of our orders there was a parasitic pea crab. These little critters are found in mussels, clams, and oysters. We told our waiter about this alarming surprise in one of the mussels we ordered. However, he said that the pea crab is commonly found in their mussels? My friend and I were very puzzled because we have never seen a pea crab in all of the mussels we have eaten until now. This was the first time Hwaro kind of disappointed us. I plan on still coming back for their KBBQ because it is so good, but I would not recommend their mussels."}
{"text":"Showed up at 2:07 am when the business clearly stated closed at 3:00 am after catching a Lyft from downtown and were told that they already had done last call!!! Seriously so inconsiderate, workers didn't give care what so ever.  Should post a sign or give some sort of advertisement!!! So upset and so disappointed! Staff sucks, obviously just wanted to go home! Would give 0 stars if could!"}
{"text":"Great food and service at a great price. We waited 30 min for a table but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"The place was super clean and nice, much more than I expected at an AYCE bbq place. The staff there were so nice and welcoming. We came on a Friday night so of course there was a wait but it was well worth it. Upon our seating, they already had the banchan, water, and grill ready to make up for the wait.  I'm a fan of beef tongue and I was so happy there portions were generous; Actually all their portions of meat were generous. They had multiple choices of banchan which were all so yummy! For their desserts, we had the red bean and plum ice cream. Both were very interesting.  When my boyfriend and I come to Las Vegas for another vacation, we'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq in town, other than the wait, which can be a bit lengthy, but when you're that good it should be expected. Not only is their food fresh, but the service is superb, always very attentive where water and the grill are replaced without needing to ask."}
{"text":"I'm so down with this place. $20 for all you can eat? You can't beat that! And everything is delicious. We had a little bit of everything and left with full bellies and indulged tastebuds."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Great food and drinks! Will definitely keep coming back. Fabulous!!"}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE kbbq place hands down!!!  Line is always long but dont worry, it's worth the wait. My favorite here is definitely the brisket and their affogato dessert. If you are feeling adventurous, try the Octopus to scare your white friends. Quality of meat is good and place is clean. The servers are always attentive and quick to change your grill and get you more meat. I also love that they're open until late. My coworkers and I love coming here, and you do get the best bang for your buck cause it's so cheap and you have so much options.   Tip: Order the Garlic Butter and use it to dip your meat. So good!"}
{"text":"They were amazingly good and we had a great time. The food was high quality even though it was an all you can eat situation. \"The Shit\" was delicious."}
{"text":"Hwaro is my favorite Korean bbq place and Korean bbq is my favorite. Friendly and attentive servers."}
{"text":"I've missed eating Korean bbq since I've moved here from LA. This place isn't bad at all for the price. Got here around 330pm, parking lot is small for the area, so I can see this becoming a problem if you want to come here later in the night.   Place was pretty empty. I thought the decor was really nice and we got to sit on the table that was on a platform, which was nice.  I really like the steel round grill as opposed to the rectangular black grill. Meat cooks faster and if it's done I like to push it the edge of the round grill, so they don't get burnt.    The highlights for me were the steamed egg, kimchi, corn cheese, beef tongue, and the marinated squid. I feel like in LA not many places serve beef tongue.  So it was a treat to see it being served here.  The key is to cook it just when it turns slightly brown,  cook it too long and it can be rubbery and tough.    The marinated squid was pretty awesome.  And the corn cheese had really good mayo/onion flavor and not too sweet which I love. Kimchi was yummy and sour. I also like that they provide us with plenty of sesame oil/dipping sauce and bottles of ice water, so we don't have to always ask for more.  I think it's cool that ice cream is included.  Not many bbq places offer that.  I prefer the green tea,  the plum one reminds me of pink bubblegum I used to eat as a kid hehe.   The brisket was too fatty. So we didn't order more of it. We also tried one of the marinated meats, too sweet. I think I just prefer eating plain meat.  The pork belly was ok, also more on the fatty side.    Overall it was a good experience. I would definitely come back again for my Korean bbq fix :)"}
{"text":"Great late night k bbq!! They are opened till 3 and have a huge selection of fresh meats!! U won't regret trying!!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to visit with my family. very small place but very friendly and accommodating. the first thing I have to say is watch your footing..  they use alot of non stick and its all over the floors you can ice skate in this place..  The menu is all you can eat with the exception of a few items on the bottom of the menu which are one time only one per guest. The selection is good but not expansive. The price fits the menu. they are very attentive to your table and keep the cook surface changed out often. the food is fresh place is clean other then the slick floor. Side dishes are ok i did like the dressing on the salad. Do not rush yourself her.. take the time to try the selections and find your favorites."}
{"text":"This is place hands down is fantastic! Let me tell me u, my girl originally got me into KBBQ back in LA. And we tend to check out a lot of spots to find something that is affordable but great! This is everything ur looking g for and more! I understand that price will jump from time to time ultimately a. Business goal is to become profitable so that's a given, bit u can pick 45 items after 10pm-3AM for $20 solid deal! If u write a yelp review they give u a small Sapporo (as I was writing this the waiter told me lol) and the customer service is beyond fantastic! The quality of meat is fantastic, marinated items are also awsome and again CUSTOMER SERVICE is everything!  Great job guys! People this is a no trainer, try the place out. Worst come to worst, ur out $20 to find out that this place may not be for u."}
{"text":"best kbbq place in town, wide variety of choices for a good price! worth the wait.   i recommend getting here before prime dinner hours to avoid the long wait time."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. My first Korean bbq experience. I'll be back. Parking in the plaza is difficult but there are spots I the street as well."}
{"text":"The food is just amazing. I would recommend the skirt steak for meat lovers. In addition, I would do all the All Day Specials! Amazing service by staff and super helpful when deciding. I would recommend coming here with small or large parties!"}
{"text":"Absolute best AYCE Korean BBQ in town!!! Been here so many times and have never been disappointed! I'm on my way there now!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price but minus one star for the long wait but otherwise, it's so far the best buffet kbbq I've had."}
{"text":"We came here at 6pm on Saturday. We're told 30 minute wait and after an hour and 10 minutes we were told we'd have to split our party into two tables (we had 8 people). We agreed but passed a table that would have accommodated us easily that was then given to a smaller party in line behind us. So that was a little upsetting but what really got me was the poor service. We had to order some things twice with two different people who always seemed annoyed that we were bothering by ordering. We sat with no drinks for some time and not once did anyone apologize.  We used to take our friends and family here when they are in town but I guess we will look for another place since it seems to be such a bother for them to have people there.  The food is ok, I've had better and had worse but again the service was"}
{"text":"Love coming here and getting the Shit they have amazing service which makes it even better"}
{"text":"Love this place !   Everything is so good and delicious ! The service was amazing . Never did I once have a empty water cup anything .  Place is really clean and I love that it's very private in some sections !!  MUST TRY THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"My roommate took me here for the first time tonight and it was delicious! Very clean and well managed, fast paced and fast service. I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"i have been to hwaro many times i have got to say this place is superb . Great service overly tasty food . if your looking to try a new place or have a date night planned give this restaurant a try i promise you wont regret it !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food that will have your mouth watering every bite. Weekends, mostly Saturday, is the busiest, but it is worth the wait no matter what, and the best KBBQ restaurant I've ever eaten at. The service is perfect, and although some may complain about it, it's because store rules are rules. The price is just right for delicious food, and the water does not taste like tap water. I come here 3 times a month, and the experience is every visit is just like the beginning, except I get the excitement of sitting and munching my life out."}
{"text":"It's an excellent place!  Great AYCE  I am very picky about buffets  But everything is so good!!! Fresh and good quality   And service is awesome too!!  Jennifer and J are great!   Must try if you're in off the strip in Vegas"}
{"text":"Very Generous portion, but the wait line is too long and service is hard to imagine is a Korean BBQ place."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite bean paste! Great selection of meats to choose from.  Come early if you have a large group as wait times can be long especially during peak meal hours.  Ventilation is ok, you will still leave smelling like bbq.  Worth it though!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. They have a good amount of choices for the ayce price. This is probably one of the better kbbq places here in Vegas. The service is definitely better than most. The servers come and check on you a lot of times so we were never out of meat or drinks or sides. The brisket and the squid were our favorites. We loved the soup and the steamed egg for sides as well. It's too bad they don't have japchae here. They also don't have an alcohol license yet so no soju either :( but for about $20/person you can get your kbbq fix and you'll leave feeling happy and full :D"}
{"text":"Fast service and good food. They make no reservations, make sure to arrive with the entire party to get seated. Garlic butter on steak is good pretty much on everything bbq. Meat selection is good and there is good table space for a lot of plates. A little warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to eat on vacation. Great value $20/$23 for Korean BBQ buffet. Can't beat that price. Good selection and service! Opens late til 3am. Definitely a place to try.."}
{"text":"Quality of meats is average, but for $20 you have a huge selection of meats and other non bbq dishes- it's a reallyyyy extensive menu.   The space is small, there were maybe... 8 tables that sit 4/5 people, and 2 large tables for larger parties. We had a party of 4 and the wait was ~30-45 min. Definitely wouldn't come here with a huge party. The 2 older korean women who were the hosts and likely the owners weren't the friendliest, either.   Service was pretty terrible. We had to ask numerous times for some of our orders.   Would I come here again? ehhh.. for the long wait time, subpar quality of meats, and poor service- I'm hesitant. It's saving grace is the fact that it's $20 and has such a large selection of items on the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went yesterday and I cannot tell you enough how much we enjoyed our experience here. They've only opened for about a week, but oh I see great potential in this place.  We really wanted AYCE bbq since we went on a 4 hr long hike and after taking a nap we just wanted to feast. We thought about Tofu Hut but we can never get in because they're always packed.  So to sum it down, atmosphere is nice. The price for AYCE is decently priced. The meat selections are very delicious! The unfortunate part is their selection is small.  Lots of appetizers, I especially loved their kimchi because it wasn't too sweet or too sour/spicy.  Service was excellent as well! Definitely coming back! Next time I want to try their Mackerel combo."}
{"text":"Just went there. My 8 year old daughter was up to eat 2 pieces of brisket. Then fall right back to sleep. Didn't even wake up for ice cream. The waiter even saw her sleeping the whole time. Yet when we asked them if they could just charge me half price, which is 4-7yrs old. I was still willing to pay for her) but the waiter told him NO. Like are you serious right now? I used to love this place. But not anymore. The whole time the waiter was taking care of us my daughter was asleep. And he saw it. But still said charge full price!!! Bye hwaro. Not coming here ever."}
{"text":"My favorite all you can eat Korean BBQ. It's always a bit of wait but I think it's worth it. Love their pork cheek"}
{"text":"This place might actually be my favorite korean bbq place!  I've tried tofu hut, gen bbq, hobak, and honey pig. This place has so many options!  52 menu items that includes appetizers, meats, sides and dessert!    My favorite meats are the skirt steak, pineapple beef, pork cheek and galbi. Also I love the shake shake rice.   Service is pretty good. They are nice and bring you food pretty promptly. However beware because they give you however many portion according to table size. So if you want a little of something just to try, let them know beforehand."}
{"text":"This is probably my fifth time coming here since they opened, and I guess news of how good this place is has gotten around. Went there on a Wednesday night around 8:30p and there was a waiting line to be seated. Food taste has gotten better since my first review (not that it was bad to begin with), and service is also much better. No need to ask for refills anymore as the servers are very attentive. Nari is my favorite!!! But she now works the late shift 10p-closing :( They stay open later now, til 3a. Oh well, guess I'll just have to come here for my late night food cravings. Which I don't mind, because: \"I love kbbq. Kbbq is my life.\" -chipotle kid's voice"}
{"text":"This place use to be my favorite go-to Korean BBQ spot but I recently went to Hwaro for dinner and finally got seated after 45 minutes with a cockroach crawling on our table. I told one of the workers and she killed it. Her reaction wasn't very surprising."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The appetizers are great! So many to chose from. \"The Shit\" is absolutely delicious!  The meat is good but the appetizers make this place better. The service is always good even when they are busy."}
{"text":"During my visit to LV, I tried this place.  I saw 4 star average rating and was excited to try out. Well, I was disappointed. Server was not polite.  We had to wait long for meat to come out. Only reason I rate this place 2 star is because the quality of meat was decent.  I don't know if this place qualifies for 4 star in LV but not in LA.  In LA, there are many other places with better quality in both food and servers."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the great reviews. Sadly, I didn't have the same experience. The group i was with and I were very disappointed. We had to almost beg them to come out with food and water. They kept disappearing. We didn't even receive tongs or scissors to cut the food and stir it around. The guy would leave after we ordered and didn't return. We had to get up multiple times to find someone to bring us what we ask for. We were there for 2 hours and left hungry. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was one of the better KBBQ places in Vegas. Wait was long(because there was a lot of people), though when seated and you get to dine, the food is delicious. For $21, you can choose from amongst 52 different items. I would recommend to anyone craving barbecue with a big appetite"}
{"text":"They have great service and excellent food. They bring out the food really quick and their beer is great.  I really like the brisket and beef tongue. It is worth getting the premium all you can eat just for extra bucks."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of KBBQ, but not a fan of this place. Honestly, I felt that so many things went wrong with my experience, that maybe the restaurant was having a bad day, but honestly, I have had better quality meat from more \"average rated\" KBBQ places.   My honest opinion is, it's a bit of a letdown compared to the other restaurants and food places that surround it.   AMBIANCE: 4 - Super intimate and really cute. It's definitely a place to take your meat loving friends on a romantic (or platonic) date. It's a very friendly setting, and the other groups are sitting far away enough so that they don't have to hear your silly banter and conversation.   SERVICE: 1 - The staff was friendly, but they were slow and inefficient. There was barely that many people, but we barely got served at all. My friend raising or waving her hand took up half of our time that we spent there. When they finally got around to us, they handed us our meat fairly quickly, but forgot to give us metal tongs and scissors. Another 15 minutes passed before we finally got noticed and someone gave them to us.   FOOD: 2 - Was all the food fresh? Yes, it was. Was it amazing? Not really. I mean, the kim chi was probably the best part. And I don't really like kim chi all that much. The salad was good. Honestly, I have experienced better quality meat at Korean BBQ Garden house and Tofu hut, and several places in California. When I eat KBBQ, I don't usually eat the marinated meat.   By this point, I was definitely upset and I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I was there late night and they even charged me the wrong price (19.99 instead of 16.99), but I wanted to get out of there so bad that I didn't even care. Not a place that I will frequent."}
{"text":"CONGRATS on ruining our night!!!   ARROGANT, DISGUSTING, DISRESPECTFUL, ABSOLUTE WORST!!!  Feb 25th, the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE we ever had at HWARO! First of all me and my crew loves this place. Reason why i said crew is because normally when we eat here minimum is 9 people. We usually eat here once or twice a month but never had such a horrible experience.  At the beginning of our dinner, we were already planing our next visit next week. So far everything was great, until we were almost done and asked for our grill to be changed. So before we asked for our grill to be chaged, we ordered 2 hwaro steaks from our ARROGANT and DISRESPECTFUL server named DAN. He wears glasses, tall guy, stay away from him!!! Bad temper and ill-mannered.   So after they replaced the grill, after about 10 minutes of waiting for our steak, I called DAN. I said, \"can you check on our steak because we've been waiting for about 10 minutes and if you look at our grill it's already burnt, yet we still haven't used it because we're waiting for the steak.\" I just asked to remind him about our order because they might have forgotten about it. I was just reminding him, then DAN replied in an elevated voice, \" CALM DOWN OKAY, CALM DOWN! IT'S COMING!\" I was shocked and at the same time i felt very disrespected!   My crew and i had lost our appetite because of how we got treated, specially me. As regulars here we've never encountered such HOSTILITY! As a customer i felt very embarrassed because of how i got treated, also for the people next to our table that heard him and how he reacted when he replied to me.  After he said that, DAN never came back to our table. We were again waiting to order our desserts, IT WASN'T BUSY but DAN never came around! We asked a bus boy to call our server but instead he sends a different server named Maribel if I'm not mistaken.   Before we head out, i went to the front desk, while Dan was there i asked for a MOD (manager-on-duty) but the hostess said there's no one for the night! Surprised because how can a business operate without any shift leader, supervisor, manager or even a GM! No one to advise about our issue! Very FRUSTRATING!  At the end of the night, DAN never showed his face to us, didnt even apologized even though i know he over heard me complaining about him. Because the hostess called him first to hear the complain but he sends someone to talk to me on his lieu.  ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING to recieve AUTO-GRATUITY! STAY AWAY FROM DAN!   More comments will be posted over social media to make DAN popular! Me and my crew will make you famous.   **** 1 star for absolute worst customer service***"}
{"text":"This place is for sure the best AYCE korean bbq in Vegas! I've tried 3 other places and this place has the most extensive menu and the quality is pretty good. It's not LA/socal k bbq place but good for vegas."}
{"text":"Really great food and I really enjoyed a lot of things here. Okay service but food is just great and unlimited is awesome"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Decent price for all you can eat and the staff is friendly but be prepared to wait a little while. They have a wide variety of meats to select from and they're appetizers are delicious. I'd recommend the bulgogi nachos"}
{"text":"My favorite KBBQ place in Las Vegas! They are really consistent with their food and I love all their selections! I've taken friends and family every time they visit and they never disappoint. Fast service and wait times aren't too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!!!   Must visit if you are from out of town All day special $20.95. / Lunch and late night $17.95"}
{"text":"When I tell you I'm a Korean bbq addict I mean what I say. This is like the fifth I've tried in Vegas and it's ok but it's not my favorite. My favorite is in Hawaii but that's another story. I've been wanting to try this place for a while but every time we've come the place is packed. We decided to wait it out this time and wait time was shorter than expected. They have a few tables that don't have grills on them so I believe if they put the hood vent over them and converted the tables they could make more money and cut down on wait times but that's none of my business.   There's a pros and cons to this place just like other KBBQ places I've had in Vegas. Pros are the price and service. Cons are the wait time and quality of meat. The price is a steal at 16.99 compared to some other places that are $30 or more depending on where you go but for those prices the quality is superb. The service we had here is was actually quite good. We were checked on quite a bit during our meal and rarely had to flag down a waiter. The concept of having your own water pitcher saves a lot of issues in my opinion and is pretty genius but the fact that the table space and wall being so close behind you can make some people pretty uncomfortable. Believe me I seen some people turn their table to the side having no room to move.  Ok I've explained some of the pros and cons I'll talk about the food. Banchan is ok. The kimchee is my favorite it's always my favorite with KBBQ. Theirs is packed with flavor they didn't not skimp on the marinade.The pickled cucumbers and bean sprouts follow behind leaving the other few banchan dishes we were served. The salad here is delicious like when I tell you I ate the whole bowl by myself I'm not joking. I like that they serve sauces with the meat in a big enough dish that you don't really have to ask more. Unless you're me and you dip everything in the sesame oil with S&P that's the only one I use because it's all you need IMO. They have a pretty good assortment of meats but my favorite  was the ribeye and brisket. Pork was pretty good too and the chicken I was surprised at because I thought it would be dry. Take my advice and get the meats unmarinated if you like to dip so you're not salt bombed as my friend Antonia says.   I know Tofu Hut has a bad wrap but I still prefer them over this place price wise. For quality DJK is my top fav. If the hype dies down I may give them another shot but to me they're just alright."}
{"text":"Server Jun is so nice! . Kbbq wait is worth it . Good for hanging out with friends . Definitely gonna be my place for kbbq"}
{"text":"This happens to be one of my favorite places that I have ever been to! The food is amazing along with the expertise of staff!!! Great vibes and fun! I recommend this to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"New menu and more grill tables. Expanding business is a plus in my books. They have good quality meats and selections for the price to have us keep coming back. Love it"}
{"text":"It's a spacious place, clean and the people who works here has a good working attitude towards their customers..I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best comparison is a more neighborly version of Gen Korean BBQ minus the neon lights and K-pop music.  You will get good friendly and prompt service but wished that the crowds would go away as a 30 minute wait is typical.  The biggest plus is that AYCE is only $22.99 per person.  The meats and sides are standard.  Unfortunately, the \"premium\" steak which is limited to one person is pretty tough same as Gen.  However, for this price, you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best Korean BBQ I've been to.   I took a star off because it was very hot in the restaurant because of the little space and lots of heat from everyone cooking.   Other than that, I love the environment. The food was delicious and fresh. I love the all you can eat with the many different meat choices.   The affagato was delicious too!!"}
{"text":"Love this joint.   $20 for all you can eat. ***Do not over order; they will charge for excess ordering.***  Tip: Be ready to order fast. They all seem to be in a rush here. That seems to be the general attitude in a lot of the restaurants in China Town.   We ordered:  Marinated Sliced Ribeye Sweet & Spicy Pork  Pork Belly Enoki Beef Act Like Korean  First off, there was just two of us. It was WAY too much food. We ate the majority of it, but we were INSANELY full. I had to unbutton AND unzip my pants. But, this was all good meat. It's not like this crazy high quality of meat, but it's well worth the $20 you spend.   Best part - it is super fun to cook your own meat to get it to your liking. This is a perfect place for a date night if you're both looking for something new and fun. WARNING: you will smell like you've been grilling meat all night. And you WILL smell of garlic. Some people dig it."}
{"text":"The shit is the shizznit. What else can I say Neil cooked everything for everybody."}
{"text":"Come early. Food is great. Great atmosphere and family-friendly. Authentic Korean food makes a really popular spot"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and organized. We were greeted when we walked in and seated in a very short time. The smell of the meat grill made us salivate even more. Since it was our first time here, our server Dorothy was very patient in explaining the rules of the \"all-you-can-eat\" and how the food would be brought out. Side dishes were on point"}
{"text":"I would usually give this place 5 stars because I genuinely love going to this place and suggest this place too many people. But unfortunately my last visit I went with my friends (8 of us total). We all finished and paid. We chilled right outside the door just relaxing and letting our stomachs settle with all the food we ate. As we were outside a worker came outside and told us one person didn't pay; accused us and kept walking in and out. Every time she came back out she repeated again, \"Someone didn't pay\". Which is weird because literally she was one ringing us out. 3 of us paid for 2 each. Last two paid separately. My boyfriend paid $35 in cash and rest on card for the both us. So unless she is pocketing our money. I don't understand why she would accuse us. SHE RANG US UP. Why would we not pay and just stand outside? Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"With their new rule, I was kicked out for going in there alone, it wasn't even during busy hours. Unlike some asian all-you-can-eat that charge extra $ for taking a table alone, they actually kicked me out."}
{"text":"This place is definitely with the wait. The service and quality is always great and the fact that they offer dessert with the ayce is a nice ending to a meal!"}
{"text":"Best deal for AYCE bbq! ($19.99)And I could not say anything bad about the food or service. Also, it's a great food experience for those who want to try something new!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tasty and free drink for rating on yelp. Man this is tasty. I want to eat here every time I go to Vegas. This sure is great."}
{"text":"To begin with, the service is kind of slow when we ordered, but other than that, I'd definitely recommend coming over to this unique Korean BBQ in Las Vegas as they serve one of the best meats out there. So if your going to Las Vegas for a vacation, totally go here for all you can eat kbbq."}
{"text":"Great spot for ayce Korean BBQ. Been here many times and still love it. Friendly staff and tasty food. Lots of appetizer options as well!"}
{"text":"Meat quality for AYCE was average however the service was way better than any AYCE places in town. Side dishes were good. Only draw back was no alcohol. According to the server, license has expired and I don't know if the are working on the renewal and if so how soon they will be serving alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is not as bad as its overall review. The place is clean and has enough space. What I really liked is how fast they deliver your order. They're quick on their feet! The lady, who I think owns the place, is always asking customers how they're doing which is a gold customer service to me. It's a good place to try considering they have a pretty large variety for the price of usual kbbq."}
{"text":"Imagine a place where you are presented with an endless array of meat options and appetizers to choose from. Not only that, but you can keep on ordering as much as you want for the low low price of around $23. Well my friend, I am here to tell you that this place does exist and it's called Hwaro.   AYCE Korean BBQ has always been a weakness of mine. I have a special fond spot in my heart for grilled meat, so it's always been like we're a match made in heaven. Anyways, Hwaro offers an extensive menu with many meat options, appetizers, and a few desserts to choose from. Most of these items can be ordered as many times as you'd like, but there's a few that are restricted to one order per person. Grilling is done by you or anyone at your table, so it creates a fun and interactive experience for your party.   When choosing meats, you should know that you're either getting marinated or unmarinated meat. Personally, I like to start with the unmarinated meat, such as the brisket or pork belly, which I then dip into the dipping sauces they provide for you. Starting with the unmarinated meat keeps the grill clean, and makes sure none of the tastes are really conflicting with each other. However, if your grill does become burnt or messy, don't fret. You can always request a grill change, and they will bring a clean one for you.   Still conflicted on what to try? Here's a list of some of my personal favorite items off the menu:  Appetizer: - Bean Paste Soup -Steamed Egg -The Shit  Meat: -Brisket -Pork Belly -Skirt Steak -Short Rib -Spicy Pineapple Beef Steak -Enoki Beef  These are just a few of my favorites, but it's a good place to start. I hope that all of you become as addicted to KBBQ as I am. Keep on grillin'!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, selection, food & price. The employees were very on top of it & made sure we got what we wanted. For all the sides, snacks & meats available for only $19.95! So good"}
{"text":"I always do my reviews on price, and for the money this place was great, the meats were all very fresh and  meat was all good cuts. The staff are extremely hard workers and are onto everything very fast, the atmosphere feels like a rave with the music however it's actually a lot of fun, it would be a good place before going out . The wait is very long (it's  cheap and good what do you expect) I worked out that you can just add 8mins per each group in front of you for judgement of time, I worked this out by how long everyone in front of me was waiting compared to how many groups went in, I went and had a few drinks with my group at the bar close by and it worked out almost exactly right. The wait is worth the food just put your name down and go get a drink."}
{"text":"Our go to Korean bbq place.  Great sides fast service.  Briskets hit or miss sometimes comes out frozen and it sticks to the grill but everything else pretty much on point. Recommended orders: Shake shake rice Skirt steak Short ribs Beef bulgogi ( sliced ribeye ) Kfc"}
{"text":"Great place! The customer service is quick and very attentive and there are a lot of food options on the menu. One of the better KBBQ places I've been to in V"}
{"text":"So I'm very happy to have tried this KBbq joint. I really enjoy eating here now as far as meat quality I will say that I have had better but for the price you cannot beat it. I really love the service you get here. There's some special things I would recommend that do stand out if you eat here.. Here's a list of what to order  1. Order the garlic butter and the ribeye and or brisket. Dip your meats in this yummy goodness   2.garlic jalapeno beef belly,pork belly,short ribs   3.steamed egg/ I like to eat the steamed egg with rice and a bite of meat (dipped in a sauce of course)  Try all the sauces sesame oil and salt, soy bean paste,house sauce is bomb too.  Dip your meats and try them out it's super fun experiencing it ..have some fun with your food while cooking it. I can't wait until I come back again"}
{"text":"It's always consistent whenever i come to eat here, one of my favorite spots for kbbq! I highly recommend the pork cheek, and baby octopus!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food quality and taste of Hwaro, but the service element leaves this place seriously lacking. Teresa is by far one of the best, but she is only one person. I think the other servers need to learn from her and pay more attention to the patrons."}
{"text":"This food is REALLY good, food is top quality! Staff is great. This is ine of my favorite all you can eat places!!!"}
{"text":"We waited about an hour to be seated on a Monday afternoon but Hwaro was definitely worth the wait! This place a little different from other Korean BBQ places I've been to because it includes different appetizers on their all you can eat menu which adds even more variety to your meal. We really liked the Korean fried chicken and 'the shit', but can't forget the steamed egg which is one of my personal favorites.   Our server did a great job with checking up on us regularly and making sure our grills were regularly changed out for fresh ones.   Pro tip: wear stretchy pants."}
{"text":"We come here pretty often for the BBQ not a bad all you can eat place! Sauce is really good."}
{"text":"Great variety. Good service. Decent food. The wait staff keep bringing plates of meat until we got sad there was so much food."}
{"text":"Great little Korean bbq place, great service. Huge selection for 22.95 all day all you can eat. . Food came out pretty quickly. Yummy \"house dipping sauce\". Pineapple marinaded steak was one of our favorites, had tons of flavor and was super tender. Overall pretty standard but very good AYCE Korean BBQ. 4/5"}
{"text":"Hwaro is my go to spot for Kbbq. They have a great selection at a fairly good price. Food is always good here, try the Bulgogi Nachos!"}
{"text":"My go-to KBBQ spot! I've been back in the states for 3 years since I've left Korea, and this is the closest taste I've enjoyed to the actual KBBQ in the motherland.  Pros: Service is fast Price is decent Food quality is high Variety of items on the menu Delicious desserts, try the affogato! Interior design is appealing Atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable  Cons: Table is always sticky Restroom interior needs an upgrade Seating time is usually around 20 mins Establishment is HOT in temperature  Overall I enjoy the food, which is why I dine here. Service is nice and fast and my bill has never been botched. Good place to dine!!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome, food is absolutely amazing, and the atmosphere is breathtaking. Been here so many times, love being a repeat customer. Staff is best part at this place. Extremely impressed."}
{"text":"Customer service is huge for me. My family and I waited 2 hours. No problem. I went to check our spot on the list, we were next. The hostess comes out and calls my name, I said \"right here\" loud enough for other people to see also. The hostess seated TWO parties way further down the list. When I asked what was up, she straight up said \"well you didn't say anything\". Had I not asked her, she would have proceeded to continue skipping over us. Not to mention, she had been calling out names the entire night to see who was all waiting still. So she had seen and called me twice prior to this.   Food was good. Service sucked hard. Put a bad taste in my mouth to begin with so I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I wanted to."}
{"text":"The food is always great when I come here.  Bulgolgi nachos are great! There's food right away at the table when you get there."}
{"text":"Their beef tongue is the best, this place is the only place I trust in China town. Also I like that they play kpop songs inside."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck Korean food. Baby octopus comes covered in sweet gochujang and is delicious. Service is great, our server jayson made sure we had everything we needed, clean grill was replaced frequently. The unsweetened ice tea has a hint of peach, highly recommend! Tons of sides. Medium to mild level of spicy for most things, so this is a safe place to take first time Korean eaters."}
{"text":"WARNING: it's hard to find parking within the shopping center so you might have to park on the road or the church next door.   I used to come to Hwaro when they weren't as busy. When we used to come through the door and get seated but now in most cases Hwaro has a wait. There's little seats at the front or the tables on the left upon entering to sit and wait. They have a sign-in sheet where you would let the lady at the front know how much there is in your party. All you can eat dinner for two people cost about $46/$48. But you get your monies worth.  They have a lot of great tasting quality meat and sides to order such as gyoza's! It is unlimited for most items on the menu except for some that are indicated with a star. At the end of your dinner yo I have a dessert option before you pay the bill, which is a huge plus. During the summer their AC doesn't appear to work as much so imagine siting in a crowded restaurant filled with hot air, it ain't relaxing. I try to prevent going here in the summer or if I do, I'd go at night. Customer service is good, there's really nice ones who stands out but there are also ones who are just okay."}
{"text":"Great price, great service and great food plus it's all you can eat! What's not to love??!!"}
{"text":"1hr wait for a party of 4, ish, but hey yelpers say this is the place for all you can eat Korean BBQ so let's see how this turns out. There isn't a place like this in Phoenix but we been to plenty of places like this in LA.  Music is pretty loud in here if you don't mind the rave music then you should be fine. We usually order the steam eggs which we were told only 1 per table, it came out burnt so that was a fail. The server cooked our food for us which was fine with us since none of us wanted to man the grill. We all ordered the all you can eat and yes it is worth it. Their side dishes like the garlic, jalapeños and I think it's mash potatoes with corn in it were really good.   Definitely a place to come for Korean BBQ but the wait is very long so be prepared for at least 1hr."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! For 19.99 all you can eat for 2 hours from appetizers to main dish and it includes dessert!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. They need a bigger place so that you don't wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"Great experience here, quality of meats excellent especially the short rib and skirt steak, the seafood salad was amazingly good like poke.  For the price of 22.95, it is a good deal, the only down side is the small parking lot and the wait, make sure to call in advance to check on."}
{"text":"I always used to go to Kung Fu Tea next store and didn't know this place was a KBBQ spot. I went here for a late Father's Day dinner with my family and was really impressed. I think this is the cleanest KBBQ spot in Vegas and one of my new favorites. Server was very attentive and nice and I had an overall great experience. Will start coming here often as opposed to other places such as Tofu Hut or Korean Garden."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place and it was awesome. All the meats were fresh and there was an awesome selection. We will definitely come back here especially for the price."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to eat there. Can't understand the reasoning for not allowing single diners. Host stated it's because they think single diners won't order enough meat? Which makes no sense because IF that were the case, wouldn't that be a good thing for y'all? You still get my money but i order less meat...either way it makes no sense to not allow single diners. Was really looking forward to trying it too after great reviews. Will not be bringing groups here at all. Very disappointed in service (or lack of)"}
{"text":"It's an AYCE for about $20 a person. The wait was a bit long. The place isn't that huge so it's understandable. There is a time limit. And you will be charge for left overs. Meat wise, it was okay. Its suitable for the price you're paying. The wait staff wasn't bad, but they could be a little friendlier. If you leave a \"good\" review on Yelp, they'll give you a free beer. Just don't have high expectations. It's cheap. So you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"What a great new Korean BBQ joint in Las Vegas! Great variety of ban-chan (Korean side dishes) and meats that are fantastic. This establishment was previously an outdated and old Korean BBQ establishment. Newly remodeled, clean, fast and friendly service. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to tofu hut since I discovered this place. And service is also great compared to tofu hut. This has been my new favorite spot to eat kbbq!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the crazy good food and selection they'd be rated way higher ..I would never sit through the kind of service otherwise but hands down best quality food for decent price"}
{"text":"Thank you lord!! My prayers were heard. I'm so glad that I don't have to settle for Tofu Hut anymore. Vegas has the best ayce sushi but I found myself missing O.C. for the ayce kbbq T_T now I don't have to \"visit family\" to have delicous kbbq.  I can never fully cheat on Mr. Bbq in Fullerton, hence Hwaro gets 4 stars but its also because I think service could be better and pricing is a little high. Besides that, the meat quality is great and the banchan is yummy. Something else I like is that they have dipping sauce other than just salt and oil.  Cute decor too!"}
{"text":"Limiting a steam egg one per table really sucks. Limiting ice cream to one serving per person also sucks. My kids loved their ice cream and paid full price to get in but limited to one ice cream. Boo to that !!!  Why the 5 star review you might ask, to get a free beverage.  This place has gone down hill. The galbi is really not galbi. Skimping. I will no longer frequent this place like I used to. They don't have seafood tofu soup like others. Very limited menu but they up their pricing. I recommend going to Gens. They are at least kid friendlier."}
{"text":"I love this BBQ, all you can eat!! Reasonable price, many choice and nice service!! We eat here once a month. Good for family ,couple , party I recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Super good food!!!! Must try!!! And free beer with a review! Huge selection of food and side dishes. Parking is difficult but worth it. Try the short ribs. Tongue. And premium steak. Well worth the 20.95 price."}
{"text":"Been here about 2 times and each time it's been with only one other person so our wait time is very little compared to groups (one time a group waited more than an hour, felt bad when we were seated within 15 min) but let's get down to the food shall we? The steamed egg has been a recent discovery of mine since I've started trying Korean bbq places and I'm so happy Hwaro has it as I always get an order at every place that will serve it. The steak here is the best steak I've had hands down at many of the Korean places I've been too. I always ask for a side of pepper and salt to season it before I grill it.  1 out of the 2 times we were served cold appetizers which I think it was because we were there close to the closing time but my sister went with her boyfriend and raves about how good they were hot! So maybe try to get there earlier than closing times and you can still get their dinner deal which is a steal for AYCE Korean bbq. One last thing the place although small has a really cool atmosphere and deco! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is good. If you're looking for something like Tofu Hut...this is the place. The food is tasty and it feels more like a relaxed place. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the parking here is small BUT worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Hwaro was amazing! They have great quality meat and speedy service. There might be a little smoke from the BBQ and it might be a bit of a squeeze, but f you can get past that, you'll find some great food!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. My favorite Korean BBQ place In Vegas. Man does this place hit the spot. It's located off strip and there is always this annoying wait. You put your name on the list and wait to get called. Smaller parties are seated first. From 11:30 am- 3 am is the all day special- $23 per person. Lunch and late night special $19.95 (just can't order from special list). The menu is quite extensive. They give you all the side dishes you want (them potatoes are so creamy and delicious!! Fish cakes were very good too)  Favorite appetizers: -garlic butter: basically whole garlic soaked in butter that you put on the grill. Need I say more? -bulgolgi nacho- nom nom. I love anything nacho though -seafood salad-  hodge podge of sashimi. Also very good.   Favorite meats: skirt steak, pork belly, and bulgolgi. Heck try them all if you can. It's all you can eat but word of caution- they make you pay if you don't finish.   Afogado for dessert was really good. Unique.   Service is good. They change out your grill plate frequently and are very attentive to that.   Go hungry and you will get even hungrier and definitely hangry from the long wait, but all of that will be forgotten once you're seated and gorging yourself. Happy eating:)"}
{"text":"The first time we came here, the service was amazing so, we kept coming back. $20 for AYCE KBBQ for dinner is a good deal; $17 for lunch. But the service has never been as good as our first visit.  They have octopus, chicken, rib eye, short rib, brisket, flank, pork skin, tripe, pork belly, pork cheek, beef belly, and bulgogi. The enoki beef is good but there's a 1-order/person limit. Appetizers include gyoza, Korean Fried Chicken aka KFC (yum!), bulgogi nachos, corn cheese, etc. You can also get sundobu in 3 different spice levels with beef, seafood or both. You get salad and banchan.  I like this place better than Tofu Hut because I feel like Hwaro has more selections and the meat quality is better. This is located in the same complex as Monta, Snowflake, Raku, Kabuto, Trattoria Nakamura-ya, etc. so, good luck finding parking space."}
{"text":"It's not as good as I expected it to be after the long wait that we had to go through (almost 2 hours - saturday night) because it's really a small place. I would say Gen's Bbq place in Henderson totally beats this place from appetizers to meat. I probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"Great place to get your KBBQ on. Great food, cool vibe, great customer service! Great great great great place!"}
{"text":"Hwaro... what can I say? The portions are huge and I suggest that if you're doing all you can eat, start slow. I came here for my birthday with a table of 8. Great selection of meats. My friend made reservations and once we got there via Uber, we still waited outside of the restaurant for a good 10 minutes. But that was okay. (We weren't in a rush) There were so many people outside. I would say 25 people outside of the restaurant waiting to get in. This was my first time eating here and I didn't mind waiting and catching up with friends.   The waiters and staff are very nice. They came to check up on us, brought us more side dishes when we were done and cleaned our stove pot frequently. However, they didn't refill our waters consistently.   This place is next to King Fu Tea (my favorite boba place) so if you do plan on eating at Hwaro and want to get boba after, save your appetite and room for dessert."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all you can eat buffet meat buffet mainly because it has the large intestine option. They have two different prices for lunch and dinner and I believe the lunch price is also an option for the late night pricing as well. All drinks and appetizers are included and they have a pretty extensive menu which you can check under the pictures and of this yelp website.  It's fairly busy especially on the weekend especially dinner time so if you do come in a group of more than four prepared to wait at least an hour or so and you can't make reservations I believe. Usually a wait time for four and under about 30 minutes or so but I believe they have some kind of snow café where you can wait if you want to. Also another tip make sure you write your name instead of just telling the hostess because sometimes they forget to write your name.  When you do order make sure you order quite a bit because the amount they give you is pretty small and by time you're done it can take a while to flag them down and they said you have a time limit but I've never had anyone actually kick us out. Some of the appetizers are similar if you've been to their sushi location (sushi neko) which is across the street.  Overall if we have out of town guests and they want to eat at all you can eat buffet we will take them here. Oh another tip it's really hot in here so don't bring any thick clothing because trust me you will be sweating and not able to eat a lot."}
{"text":"We were going for noodles next door and decided to check out the menu here while we waited for our table. Very cute restaurant, great atmosphere too. The service could have been a little more prompt but they were nice. The sweet and sour pork was not good meat but the sauce was good. My favorite was the marinated ribeye."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service is great. My first time and I was impressed. All you can eat is fair price. Can't find any other ayce Korean in town."}
{"text":"This place is a bargain for 20 dollars. All the meats were good and the waiters kept up with refills and asking us when we needed anything else. The only hassle might be the parking situation, which would likely be worse during dinner times."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience here! Good food and good customer service! Dorothy, our server is always nice every time when we come here and check out on our table."}
{"text":"Food is great and tastes fresh. \"The Shit\" is awesome and the side dish selection is plentiful. Just wish the food cooked faster!"}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" places for Korean BBQ! Always packed and a wait for a table so obviously iits worth it! Food is always amazing and the variety of food is satisfying! The lowest price for korean BBQ I know so far...Highly Recommeded!"}
{"text":"Coming from California where there is amazing and cheap AYCE KBBQ on every corner, I'd say this place is pretty comparable. They offer a pretty decent sized variety of meat and seafood for $19.99/person. It included everything from your typical short ribs, pork belly, rib eye, and brisket. It also included squid, octopus, green tea pork belly, spicy pork shoulder, beef tongue, and more!   The meat was tasty, portions weren't too huge but I appreciated that especially at the end when I was getting stuffed! Meals came with some yummy steamed egg and kimchi soup.   Service was very good! They were kind, friendly, attentive, and got the meats out in a timely manner. I will definitely be coming back here to get kbbq!  Environment: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Menu variety awesome! Best to go at opening time as place is small and it gets really busy! Must try bulgogi nachos and the shake shake rice under appetizers. Hwaro premium steak meat, short ribs, and spicy pineapple beef steak was flavorful! Great place to eat, socialize, and listen to k-pop and other todays hits lol! Wait staff are on top of it, keeps grill clean. Dined in 3X and will always return. Small joints like this always great! =)"}
{"text":"So first I'd like to say I go to hwaro very often. Started going there last year and fell in love ever since. I've had a few experiences that were fabulous and sometimes not so fabulous. Overall I love the food though.   The place is busy EVERY night and you can't make a reservation(I've tried numerous times) . You HAVE to try the salad dressing. So good. But they wont reveal what the salad dressing is made of. (I've asked them too.) make sure not to eat before you go because you will want to try everything . If you're a first timer, try a bit of everything but you MUST try : the shit, shake shake rice, spicy pineapple meat, brisket, and their ice creams. You grill your food at your own table ! Unlimited meats (on most ) and eat until you're full.  Biggest thing to look out for: you have to have at least 2 people to do the all you can eat. It's about $22 each . BUT if you have 4 or more they charge a 15% service fee. Opt out of the sodas and drinks because they charge for each one and no free refills(they come in cans). I get the water . It's free plus it doesn't mess with the tastes of the other foods you're trying.   Be careful to watch your waiter or waitress. I've had a few times where they'll just turn off the gas to our stove and assume we are done. If you're still hungry or want more let them know.   Overall good night out for a date or meet up with a friend."}
{"text":"Hwaro is the BEST KBBQ spot in Las Vegas!  Good food and great service!  Jasmine was awesome. She was very accommodating for my family and I as we celebrated my birthday."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun atmosphere!  Better quality meats than some of the ayce kbbq places I've visited and the price is very affordable."}
{"text":"Really worth your money!! All the meats are good, plus they have more varieties than most KBBQ places in town! Glad I tried this place, 5 solid stars!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing food! We had to wait almost two hours, but it was totally worth the wait! We are from Southern California, so we know good kbbq, and this is pretty up there! They had some of the best prices and the wait was DEFINATELY worth it"}
{"text":"My friend took me to this place. Place was clean and service was great. Our server Jayden was attentive and brought our food quickly. Nothing great about the meat, we had better flavor meat at Gangnam.  But its all you can eat so your not going to get prime meats. Sides dishes were tasty. I would recommend this place for small and big groups."}
{"text":"Great choice for AYCE BBQ. The meat was delicious and was very flavorful and it was a great selection of meats! The short rib was sooo on point! Definitely upgrade to the all day menu just to get your hands on it. It was affordable at $19.99 for adults and half price for kids from 3-8. My daughter doesn't really eat much so we bought her a dish a la carte which they were cool with. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow. We ended up getting the meats before our side dishes which is a first for any Korean place and they don't have hot tea! What?!? This will be our go to in Vegas moving forward. Much better than Honey Pig!"}
{"text":"after a long time feeling excited to try this place out, unfortunately I was not able to try it at all. I brought my family here for lunch, we were greeted and seated awkwardly as if we were not welcome here. As soon as we sat down i noticed the grill was dirty and asked for a replacement then the server rudely changed the grill. She was so mad about changing the grill she almost hit me on my face with the clean one on her other hand. She was not paying attention at all. After that, I asked about the menu because it was our first time here. the server who was helping us was very rude and inpatient i believe her name is KU. She seem also mad that I asked about the menu and started raising her voice and kept repeating herself \"do you get it?\" And did not even let me speak. I do not tolerate any kind of this attitude at all especially when my son is around. My family did not deserve that kind of treatment when we were very kind and patient giving them the benefit of the doubt after the encounter we had with replacing the grill. All my other family member comes here often and this is the only reason I found out about this place. It's unfortunate that we didn't even get to try the place out all due because of a server who obviously hate her job."}
{"text":"Great bbq for the ayce price. Their premium steak, sliced ribeye, spicy pork bulgogi were very good. The bone in short ribs were somewhat chewy but still flavorful. \"The shit\" and shake shake rice were a must try as well!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but I was in for a big let down. The service sucked! We felt like the server was intentionally avoiding our table.  We tried to get the attention of other servers but was ignored.  My initial excitement turned to disgust. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very cozy and clean. Not the best korean bbq but still very good. Best thing was the service, our server Jayden, was very nice and patient with all our questions. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Hell of a long wait but it's worth it.   You really can't go wrong with the meat selection.  I loved the sauce to dip the meat into after it's done cooking. We also asked for sesame oil and added it into the sauce as well. Sooo good. For dessert I got the affogato which was topped with frosted corn flakes."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and I was impressed.  The service and the food were both really on point. I would recommend anyone to check out this place if you are in the mood for some good Korean BBQ.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"How have I missed this AYCE BBQ all this time? I've been to Manta AND Kung Fu Tea! Apparently these glasses aren't working. We came here starving and ready to chow down on some korean food and let me tell you, my stomach was about to go psycho on me. Keeping this in mind, imagine how my stomach felt when the host informed me it would be a minimum of 50 minutes. A MINIMUM. I debated whether or not to head over to my other bbq place, but decided to be miserable and wait it out.   When our name were called I think I was too delusional to comprehend that we were about to actually eat some food. My reaction could be summed up in 2 words....crazy ballistic. You learn not to mess with certain types of women: PMSing ladies, Mad girlfriends, and HANGRY women. Practically ran inside past our host, only to be stopped by the frigging coolest decor I've seen so far. The inside had a feel of an old korean bathhouse, or japanese ramen house. It was so great.   We ordered: The shit, shake shake rice( i suggest ordering if you like the taste of Korean sauces with a dash of seaweed), egg hotpot(could have been better), bulgogi nachos(YES YES), skirt steak, brisket, marinated short rib, green tea pork belly, pork belly with wine, regular pork belly and to finish it off we ordered affrogato. It was crunchy and fabulous!   The service was bombtastic! They were prompt, detailed and wasted no time getting you what you ordered. I was very satisfied with all the staff. Come try it for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here the service wasn't that great, but I decided to give it another try and wow am I happy I did.  Hwaro has quickly become my favorite KBBQ place in Las Vegas and I would even go as far as to say it's the best AYCE.  I usually do the 'All Day' special, which includes the full menu and that comes out to $22. But for I think $2 less you can do the lunch special If you're on a budget (Don't quote me on the price of the lunch special) To me, the price is completely worth it as the have a WIDE variety of meats unlike other KBBQ's in the area. They also include appetizers and desserts in their AYCE which is a total plus!  My favorite meats are the brisket, skirt steak, short rib, and beef tongue. I love dipping them in the sesame oil and cheese fondue. YOU HAVE TO GET THE CHEESE FONDUE. When I was first introduced to dipping bbq in cheese I was a little skeptical but after trying it, I can't imagine kbbq without cheese.  The only con of Hwaro, is the wait.. Which you're pretty much going to get at any AYCE Korean BBQ. But I would say if you didn't want to wait come before 6.  Customer service has really improved since the first time I went, maybe they were just having an off day, but every time I've come since then it's been excellent!"}
{"text":"It's definitely busy here. Come early so they don't run out of rice paper!! The food is good so far!"}
{"text":"Very good service and food.  Would recommend anyone coming to visit to at least stop by one night.  The wait time is a little long, but that is only because the restaurant is very popular.  Make sure you put the un-marinated food first and the marinated second to keep your hot plate clean for as long as possible. Hours of food for a good price!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place has more than delivered. We haven't eaten kbbq in many years and weren't familiar with how to eat it but the server helped us greatly! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My first favorite Korean BBQ place in town by ambience and second favorite by food. Very busy place, wait time can be from 15 min and up. But all good places are busy, so I don't mind the wait. Food is great."}
{"text":"For the price of an ayce kbbq, this place is probably your best bet. Yeah it's not the greatest quality of meat but from every other ayce kbbq place I been to, this place makes it worth the money. The biggest thing I probably don't like about this place is probably just the wait time because of how busy it always gets. I usually have to wait 45 mins to an hour everytime I go just to get seated so I wish they expanded a bit. Even with that, I always come back though!"}
{"text":"The price is right! $19.99 AYCE Korean BBQ that has a great selection of ban chan (side dishes) and a decent selection of meats.    Meats by ranking: Short rib - really tender Hwaro (thin) pork belly Rib eye Spicy chicken Pork belly Brisket Flank steak Pork skin (probably pass next time) Tripe (aka intestine) - also pass  Ban chan: Cheesy corn - I don't know of any other Vegas kbbq places with this side Korean spicy rice cake Steamed egg Picked radish, cucumbers Dried fish Chap chae Veggie Korean pancake Broccoli with creamy sauce  Based on the photos, the ban chan must change daily. I was sad to see that there were no bean sprouts or fish cake today :( I was also hoping they would have the Korean rice paper since no Vegas establishment seems to carry this side.  Negatives: limited seafood options, but what can you really expect for the price. Also as mentioned previously, no beef tongue...which is usually a fan favorite. I would suggest having different prices for additional offerings like most Cali places offer in case you want to upgrade. We were offered two grills for seven people but it would have been an awkward setup. Their larger tables for 8 only have one grill.  Positive - the service was excellent and very attentive. I like that they allow half orders so you can sample the items that you are unsure about. They have no limitations on how many orders of short rib per table. Most of the time the meat was cooked and cut for us.  The grills were changed at least 5-6 times.  Overall for the price, service, and quality of food, will definitely be back.  I have a feeling that prices will probably increase with time as other establishments have, so come get it while you can!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always enjoy coming here! Really good food for a really good price! It's a great place to eat with friends or family. I would highly recommend coming here to anyone!"}
{"text":"Everything is great, service, food, but I'm rating 4 because it has never happened to me anywhere, that they ask you to leave because they \"have people waiting\", after a 100+ bucks bill (2 ppl) you wouldn't expect that ever. For me, it was an invite to never come back again."}
{"text":"I always wanted to go here and experience this place! So I did! The food was good and the restaurant was very different compared to most, let's say it was a cute layout, it gave off this vibe that made it seem like you're somewhere else. Although, customer service was okay. Before me and my friend were able to cook our meat, the servers would ask if everything was okay and asked if we needed more food. I'm over here like uh, can't you see we haven't even cooked the food yet? So, me and my friend decided to do this thing and count how many times the servers would come up and ask if everything was okay. I swear, they kept coming back every minute. We gave up counting. Long story short, we weren't done eating yet and they kept bugging us. They already handed us our checks which we didn't ask for it. I wanted dessert but they forced us to leave. We got upset and went somewhere else for dessert. For my first experience here I would say I'm disappointed. If you want to be checked up on every minute and forced to leave this is the perfect place! Sorry, I'm not returning."}
{"text":"Best AYCE KBBQ in las vegas! Friendly staff, they always go check on our table, so many good choices and sides too. I like the decoration in the restaurant and always clean!"}
{"text":"Great K-BBQ spot. Good selections and appetizers. Decent quality meats and food is fresh. Always good service."}
{"text":"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 3/5 The shopping center, Seoul Plaza, that Hwaro is located in is extremely compact, with very few parking spaces in comparison to the amount of businesses. It's a tight drive and I always see a consistent amount of cars parked out on the residing streets. All the restaurants and shops are quite small as well, and hold a small capacity of people. Hwaro is a decent size, but the waiting area which tends to always been packed, is much too small.  The interior is cute and offers the subtle image of old school Korea, with the banners and the tree planted in the middle along with the soju caps. However, it is nothing extravagant or extraordinary. I found the location of the bathroom to be strange as it felt as though it was in the center of the building rather than in the corner, but nothing too strange.   The first thing I saw when we were seated was the water containers on the table. This is not uncommon at Korean restaurants or even restaurants IN Korea, however what I found strange was the amount of grease and popped food on the exterior of the plastic container. That was absolutely disgusting to me. I understand it IS a Korean barbecue restaurant so there will be oil popping, but there shouldn't be anything dirty for the next customer.  Along the lines of cleanliness, the tables also were not wiped down properly. I understand Hwaro tends to be PACKED and busy, with a queue that can last more than an hour long, but again, tables should be cleaned for the next customer. The fact that there was still oil and food debris on my table was disgusting, and I felt sick from the sight of the leftovers on it.   The vent fans above the grills were equally as dirty, with oil and dust covering them all over. I felt I had lost my appetite just seeing the mess that was around the restaurant. Quick service can be sacrificed for cleanliness.  FOOD: 2/5 We ordered from the all-you-can-eat menu and were not impressed, in the least. It was honestly all quite mediocre? The bean sprout and green onion salad () was way too sweet, and we found that to be true with all the marinated meats as well. The rice was strangely put into the bowls? Where the amounts were varying - one contained rice to the brim while the other bowl looked as if half was scooped out. One of the items we ordered, the baby octopus, had an extremely small serving. I almost laughed when it was TWO pieces for one order, and only ONE order per person? The garlic that we had asked for was not cut or peeled well, with the brown tops still in tact and the skin still on the cloves.   SERVICE: 3/5 I came here on a couple different occasions, both of them on a whim, and was told to wait forty-five minutes. Instead of waiting, I left and went elsewhere. However, this occasion I came during a slow hour, around three o'clock in the afternoon or so? I waited a few minutes and we were seated almost immediately.  Our server was Hanchie and he was very friendly and nice, however lacked a bit of attentiveness. For ten minutes, we waited while waiters stood around. We watched another table's guests wave their arms around until it caught the attention of a server, so we attempted the same thing and finally managed to get their attention. But again, lack of attentiveness, because our grill wasn't turned on until I mentioned it (this was after the meat we ordered had arrived at our table).   The scissors at our table were so terrible that we could barely slice through the meat. Utensils should be checked ahead of time, and our server actually watched us struggle terribly with cutting but never bothered to ask if we needed it changed; we were the ones to request.  After the first round of meats, we needed to have the grill pan changed. This is probably a personal preference, but I found it quite gross to see that the grill pans were all pre-oiled and that they were put on trays that looked quite dirty (foot leftovers), while being wheeled around the restaurant. Mistakes happen but our server did a very poor job of changing our grill pans and ended up actually spilling sauce in my lap due to the clumsy job.  Besides the fact that our server was not very attentive, nor was he quick, he also managed to constantly put plates of meat down that allowed the contents of the plate to touch the (as mentioned above) dirty table.   OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2/5 Honestly, I was excited to try Hwaro. There are so many raving reviews and I only heard good things from acquaintances. However, I found that the side dishes and meats were all way too sweet, were nothing special, and that the venue overall was not that clean. The servers were extremely friendly, but they were slow. I understand it was probably after lunch time, but that does not mean that service should be taken away from customers when it is not prime time. I will not be returning to Hwaro, KBBQ restaurants are a dime a dozen and I know a handful of better places in town."}
{"text":"Hwaro is a solid 4 star. It's all-you-can-eat and they don't skimp on the food. They are fast and the restaurant is spacious and clean. Their drinks are reasonably priced and we had a really fun night there with a group of friends.  Their non-kbbq foods are mostly fried, which we didn't love. But fun to try once. Their yogurt soju was the bomb. They unfortunately don't take any reservations at all and the only meat that was really marinated well was the chicken. But we'll be back - for the service and the value!"}
{"text":"Only having 15 generally average Yelp reviews over two years in the middle of one of the most foodcentric plazas in town did not help the previous management in what was formerly known as \"Korean Delicious\".  So it comes as no surprise that new people have come in, made a significant facelift in décor, and dole out some decent AYCE KBBQ at a nice bargain price of $20.  This is still very run of the mill.  You go in, expect to be brought multiple plates of banchan, and assume staple items like kalbi, pork belly and bulgogi are good.  Check, check.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that.  Beef tongue missing from the menu was a little disappointing, flank steak was dry (blame the cook?), but there is plenty else to load up on.  If I could do it over, I would have gone with half orders of the meat so we could have tried other offerings like small octopus, baby back ribs, Hwaro pork belly (thin sliced) and even pork skin.  Airing old school Mazinger Z shows on the television made for a nice bonus.    They will most likely have to depend on the overflow of neighboring restaurants to survive in a square full of Vegas stalwarts (Raku, Monta, Kabuto etc).  That might prove to be enough since the parking lot is packed to the gills on many evenings."}
{"text":"Great place. I love coming here. Friendly atmosphere. The food and service are A1. Would drive from San Diego to eat here again. The all you can eat special is the best."}
{"text":"Very hip place with Korean pop music. Good deal for AYCE and the selection of meat. Great customer service. Parking can be a drag but there's also street parking available behind the buildings. Overall, we had a great experience and would come again."}
{"text":"This is a very good Korean BBQ. The meat is good at the portions are big and the people who work here are very nice. They have a really good specials here, So just come here to eat."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars based on the service not on the food because I did not even get to try the food yet due to their lack of service . I called ahead asking if there was a wait and the lady said no and to come in. We got there within 5 -10 minutes from my call and when we arrived there were 3 tables open. Upon walking in no one welcomed us, said hi or even acknowledged us. After standing there for a couple minutes a last said to write our name on the board and that was it. She didn't tell us how long the wait was or anything she just walked away. All the workers were just really rude and did not smile . (They weren't even that busy and they had about 5-6 workers). Finally I asked a guy standing near the register how long the wait was and he said 30 minutes just throwing out a number . I asked him if the other names on the list have been seated already and he said \"I don't know.\" He just seemed very lost and no idea about anything. I didn't understand when there were so many open tables . Then we saw a couple just walk in sat themselves at the booth. As if maybe they were their friends or something??  Because no one called them to be seated or anything. We ended up walking out because they were not friendly and no one acknowledged our existence . The atmosphere was just ok to be honest. Wasn't any super nice decor or mood music , nothing special."}
{"text":"Hwaro ... under new management.  AYCE (all you can eat) BBQ $17 for lunch or $20 for dinner .. not a bad price.    WARNING :  if you're 21 and older and looking to have a drink, you gotta wait.  They are in the process of renewing their liquor license ... ugh (they would've got another star,  but I couldn't drink with my meal .. major party foul).   The food and service is good.  They weren't really busy when we were there so if we needed anything it was easy to get someone's attention.  One thing is they have some not so common names on the menu like \"act like a Korean\", which was spicy ribs lol or \"fat ass\" marinated pork belly.      Another change is no dessert, which they had before ... but I'm ok with that.  We are usually way too stuffed to fit in dessert.    Also if you never been to AYCE Korean BBQ be prepared to smell like it all the way home ... hahaha"}
{"text":"This is one of the best KBBQs in Vegas. Food is great, staff is great. The atmosphere is also very nice looking. It's a very nice place for a nice dinner. Please come and support awesome local vegas KBBQ."}
{"text":"The best KBBQ in Vegas, hands down!!! Everything from the banchan to the meat selection is freakin delicious. The lunch menu is cheaper than the dinner, but they both have the same things on them. Just a good tip to know if you want to save a couple bucks. And the late night menu is cheaper than both! It's always busy late night, no matter what day of the week you go; so expect a wait of at least 45 min to an hour and maybe snack on something beforehand. But once you get seated, it is so WORTH IT.   My favorite go to's are the shake shake rice, red wine pork belly, beef tongue, spicy pineapple beef, octopus, skirt steak, kalbi short ribs and bulgogi. But honestly, you can't go wrong with whatever you get. The affogato for dessert is stupid good.   Great vibe, excellent service and you will always leave satisfied. The only downside is the wait time, but with a place this good it's easy to understand why."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Good price and lots of options. Writing this so I can get my free beer."}
{"text":"Writing a new and updated review for Hwaro, which has reclaimed the title as my favorite KBBQ spot. After management changed, everything has become way better. The service, the cleanliness, and even the quality of food they served has improved vastly since the change of management. I went on a small haitus from this place from previous bad experiences....but man do I love this place. Always a wait sometimes to be seated, but worth it. Their beef belly, garlic butter, the SHIT, and their brisket are my favorite items to order. I may stick to the same meats every visit but I'm always satisfied after eating here which is why me and my bf always come back. I would definitely recommend any of your hungry tummies craving BBQ to this spot here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They DONT SERVE ONE PERSON. So if you would like to enjoy lunch and dinner as a single person. Do not waste your time on going here. They will decline your business with them."}
{"text":"Great costumer service and food. The atmosphere is very friendly and inviting. There meat quality is good. Definitely recommend the beef tongue."}
{"text":"Every time I try another kbbq place, I think \"this isn't as good as Hwaro.\" For such a cheap price, you get almost 40-50 items to choose from.  Their meat is fresh and well seasoned, and the appetizers/extras are amazing! I love the shake shake rice and kfc. The  s**t is my favorite item they have and I usually order a ridiculous amount of it when I'm there.   My only issue is that I usually have to wait at least 40 minutes to be seated. With how much business they're bringing in, I wish they could relocate to a bigger location.   Nothing beats Hwaro!"}
{"text":"I think if you're out late and have a hankering for Korean BBQ, the 10PM special makes all the other star-detractors go away. Parking in this strip shopping center is as bad as most other Chinatown strip malls, and there's really not very much of a waiting room space inside (which totally sucks if it's cold outside). They have about 5 dishes that are gluten free, so I would recommend ordering the cheese as a dipping sauce to my Celiac friends so that you don't miss out on ALL the flavors and textures of Korean BBQ. They really could have added a few more bonchon dishes. They had 6, which included Kimchi, which is decent, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious, the service was good, the dessert was ok, and the parking was terrible. I would visit again!"}
{"text":"Hwaro has a nice selection of meat at a reasonable price. It can busy during the weekends, but overall, service is prompt and the food and meat quality is generally fresh. I would definitely recommend this place especially during Happy hour."}
{"text":"Hwaro is the business. If you're in the mood for delicious meats this is your spot.   The service is great.  Best BBQ in Vegas.  Good date night spot.   #thehookup"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I haven't been able to review this place after going here for about 10 times already. Well to start off this place can get really busy during the weekends. Their lunch special is about $17.99 or all day special is $21.99. Some items are excluded in the lunch special like the Enoki beef which is my favorite and the beef tongue.etc. love their side dishes they serve us, many choices. My favorite is the potato salad. They also have multiple in their menu for pork,beef,seafood, and chicken. Really do suggesting not getting rice but just having rice paper should do the job. I have no complaints with their service , they will always check up on you. Like the dining area with their good choice in music.   This place is great for a big family dining or a group of friends. They never disappoint me at Hwaro bbq always make your money's worth. Just one sad tip that disappoints me is that you need to be in a party of 2 or more. So you can't eat here alone."}
{"text":"I have come here often and usually don't have a problem except for tonight, we came with an 8 year old child. The price does state ages 4-7 half off, she just turned 8 and had two pieces of meat and then fell asleep!! THEY CHARGED ME FULL PRICE FOR HER!  I asked, as a courtesy because we do come here often just to pay half price as that is is something they offer per the info above; however, they refused! That to me is just really greedy, i wasn't asking to NOT pay at all, i understand it is a business; however the waiter DID see her sleeping shortly after we started to eat and still told the cashier to charge full price! NO SYMPATHY AT ALL!!"}
{"text":"The wait was quick for a busy night - probably 10minutes for a table of 4. Really impressed at the wait time. Pricing is good for late night special. 17 or 18 bucks per person and its all you can eat. The meats are delicious and ther service is great. The servers here are very attentive. Possibly one of my favorite ayce kbbq places. Delicious. It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket and bulgogi were the best in our opinion. This is another good korean bbq joint but not dramatically different or better than the others. On the negative side, they charged $10 for my 5 yr old kid who ate almost nothing. Also $1.50 for a can of coke? Should be free refills using a fountain machine. Lastly, I don't know why these korean places feel compelled to play top 40 music constantly. It's the same ubiquitous shite you hear everywhere. The sound of the fan wasn't enough to drown out the aural abomination."}
{"text":"Delicious and great price compared to NJ Korean BBQ! Highly recommend coming here late at night for parking!"}
{"text":"Okey place to eat korean bbq, I'm a bit disappointed about bbq in general in LV bern trying two places in LV and the other one was decent.  This one was good but downfall lunch is around 20 bucks and everything I wanted was in different price category. So I ended up with upgrade my menu for 2 items and with tip+tax = 30 dollar or maybe a bit more.  Anyways the food was not bad I was a bit disappointed about the red wine pork belky felt like it was already cooked in advance. ( Only reason I upgrade my menu for red wine porky belly)  However this place is okey sad to be truth only LA know good korean bbq food.  If you guys coming to LA try out Bulgogi Hut worth the wait!  This place gets 3 stars because the service was average the food was average"}
{"text":"Hwaro is my husband's favorite KBBQ place. They have really good steak, bulgogi, brisket, and banchan. It can be a hit or miss sometimes, & if you have a big party (5 or more), the wait can be over an hour especially for dinner. I always try to go for lunch because all I ever order is bulgogi, brisket, extra banchan (kimchi, pickled jalapeño and radish, and fish cake), The Shit, rice paper, steamed rice, and steamed egg. Like I said, everything can be a hit or miss. There are times when the steamed rice tasted like it's a day or two old, steamed egg where it tasted weird, and brisket where it's extra chewy (we grill our brisket to the point of it being crispy btw & never had a problem with it at other KBBQ places).  I've also gone here where we have parties less than 4 people (they charge 15% gratuity for parties 4 or more), & the service is great. But those times I've gone here with parties 4 or more, their service sucked. It's like they don't try hard because they're getting gratuity either way -- which is why I had to knock down two stars. Taking one star away for gratuity of parties 4 or more (shouldn't it be 6 or more?), and taking another star away for crappy service.   I'll hold off on going here for awhile for dinner. I'll probably stick to lunch when I go here where I get better service versus coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to eat late at night. Very fast service And very friendly staff. Also the pricing is very affordable for Korean BBQ"}
{"text":"Good food. Cool place. I recommend! Good service. Their menu sounds delish  Overflowinh choices!!!! Vent is good. Not too smoky."}
{"text":"Always come down here! The service is great the meat is great if you love Korean bbq then you'll love Hawro!"}
{"text":"This review is for $19.99 dinner. Also note that my standard for KBBQ in Las Vegas is very low. There just isn't that much competition here yet. Price is pretty good for the quality of meat you get.   SERVICE Service was alright, maybe even mediocre. The employees were all friendly enough as if it was just their job to acknowledge our existence. Just enough. We were left waiting at the front door upon entry though, while this older lady felt that whatever she was doing on the cash register was more important than giving us any attention.  The main gripe I have with the service was that they were sooooo slowww. The place was relatively busy but not packed and they did have a few (3?) servers. It was only once or twice where they would voluntarily come look at us and ask us if we wanted anything. However, most of the time we had to wait or exuberantly flag someone down to refill our salad or get more meat. Maybe the servers are not experienced yet, but experienced servers would definitely notice what is in need of refilling at any table.  FOOD Thank goodness because food is the saving grace of this place. TL;DR meat was good; banchan was ok.  The banchan was not bad at all, especially compared to other KBBQ establishments. We got a large variety (8-9). The egg and potato salad was very ok, as was the kimchi and fish cake. The seaweed with radish tasted old. The standouts for me were the acorn jelly (a first in Vegas!!!), the radish sheets, and the pickeled onion slices.  Sauce Trio - sesame oil with salt and pepper (yummy), red chili (tasted like from the can), and this soy vinegar dip (pretty good). You also get bean paste and jalapeno! Looove. The salad was standard with a light an unobtrusive dressing.  Brownie points for the complimentary bean paste soup and steamed egg. Both were up to par and much better than most places here. I heard they served corn and cheese though. Where was that?!  Pork Belly (Thick) - Standard and yummy. Tripe - Very nice thick cuts Brisket - Standard, came frozen Beef Tongue - Came very frozen, but once thawed and cooked...So delicious and tender! Beef Rib - A little bit chewy but still good Wine marinated Pork Belly - So unexpectedly tender and delicious! My favorite. Pork Shoulder Butt - Fatty and soft. (Looove) Baby Octopus - 1 order per person! It came with 3 pieces. Marinated a little sweet but very delicious.  LOCATION Located in arguably one of the busiest plazas on Spring Mountain, Las Vegas even, makes parking a battle at times. There are just so many popular spots there and so few parking spaces. You can park in adjacent lots, however, for a short and easy walk.  INTERIOR I have to add this section because why the heck is their floor so oily?! Someone's going to slip soon, I know it. Also, it makes no sense that the large tables have two grills only on one side while the other half is left hanging. Wouldn't it make more sense to split two grills evenly? Apparently not. Ventilation is also pretty bad. They also don't oil their grills.  Pro Tip: Take a sheet of radish and wrap it around a piece of cooked pork belly, bean paste, jalapeno, kimchi, and pickled onion. You won't regret it!  CONCLUSION Whew, you know a review is long when there's a conclusion huh? I'll definitely return for the meat alone. Hopefully the service gets better over time."}
{"text":"This place is one of the decent Korean BBQ in town in terms of the food, but service is absolutely horrible. I've been here a few times and usually I am forgiving on the service, because I know its either a hit or a miss. But today I had my most worst experience.   I am going to make this a list so here is the experience.  - Waited an hour when I was the 2nd one on the sign in sheet,it seem like they didn't have a specific person managing the sheet and had a few groups get seating before anyone on the sheet.  - While sitting there waiting, there were guest asking about the wait time, but it seems like the workers were unsure and throwing out numbers. If you don't know, don't throw out a number and waste other people's time.  - Ask for coke and water, only to have them forget, Told them the second time and they finally brought it, but did not bring the cup for the water. Do they expect all of us to drink from that one serving bottle??? Ask for cups afterwards and it seems like the cups were not rinse, you could still smell a strong sense of sanitation water.  - Ordered 5 different meat to only have them bring it all in one plate, without giving any explanation on which was which, and only had one piece of short rib  - Server told us that they were out of tongs and said to use chopsticks instead until the tongs were available. She never brought the tongs so we had to ask another server afterwards which seemed clueless and finally brought us one, but... It look like it was not even wash, there a piece of rice stuck on it and was sticky. Told another server and she brought another one without any apology. But it seems like the previous one that they just wipe off. This was disgusting and had me questioning what other dirty hardware that they gave me.  - Had to ask them to change out my grill and before she did, she turn down the fire which she never turn back up. I had to do it myself  - Portion of food were inconsistent, sometimes they gave more and sometimes just a piece.  - When paying for the bill they charged us for 2 cokes when we only ask for one. Thankfully they took it off.  Overall, they need to have a better organization of the front of the house. That night we had like 5 different workers serve us and most of them didn't seem like they know what they were doing. As of now I would probably never come back to this place unless they get their stuff straight."}
{"text":"My go to Hwaro Kbbq  I always go here with my family and friends.   Must have brisket, short ribs, \"the shit\" (it is spicy if you can't handle hot foods) , pork belly , corn cheese , garlic butter , bean sprouts & onions.  They're always busy so when it comes to serving , it can be a little bit slow. But they always provide wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Overall my experience was pleasant. Other than the weather being super hot outside and it was also very hot inside the restaurant. The food was good, service was fast, and they did change the grill a few times. My only big complaint would be that they do charge a 15% tip to the bill for every table whether or not there is 6 or more people. So to bad for the servers but they only got the 15%. It is just another AYCE Korean BBQ place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat KBBQ spot in Chinatown area. The atmosphere is always live. The smell of the food has you excited for what's on the menu. There are many to items to choose from. It is definitely worth your money.  Fast, friendly service. If it's your first time at an AYCE KBBQ the menu explains how to enjoy your experience.   Everything 10/10"}
{"text":"Best KBBQ i've ever had.  Other places around the valley have been disappointing.  Make sure to ask for rice paper along with garlic and jalepenos to throw on the grill.  Service is great as well.  It's a bit small so expect a wait but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"There was a cockroach in the salad they served. I should have taken a picture of it. It was nasty. The server showed it to one other server and he dropped it. Stay far, far away from this place."}
{"text":"My favorite kbbq in Vegas. Great service, awesome food and reasonable prices. Long lines on weekend nights."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ!! Staff is very accommodating. My favorite was \"the shit\" and brisket."}
{"text":"Second time here, it's better than some but not the best I've had. The cheese corn is delicious of course. I've had to order off their more expensive menu because my kids love kalbi and that's on the higher priced menu. The meat doesn't have as good of a marinade on it as other places. We do like the fact that they change the grills frequently. But sometimes too frequently ha ha"}
{"text":"Other than the wait time, this restaruant is wonderful! They serve lots of different meats and sides as well. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Hwaro one night with some coworkers. I'd never had Korean BBQ before, so it was a total first for me. I got there a bit ahead of my group, put my name in and once everyone got there we were seated. There aren't a ton of tables, so the place was packed.   We ordered a plethora of food and I tried as much of it as I could but it was a lot of food. My favorite was the brisket, bulgogi and the Korean fried chicken. We tried almost all of the meats though, cause who doesn't love a meat filled meal? There was a pretty good selection of appetizers already at the table, which included kimchi, picked onion & radish, fish cake, green salad, etc. You do cook all your own meat there on the table and they switch out the cooking plate regularly. All you can eat for about $25 per person is pretty darn good, if you can eat that much.   The decor was super cute and trendy, with K-pop music videos playing. As I mentioned, it's really small so there's only maybe a dozen tables.   Parking is a nightmare - the plaza is full of restaurants and shops, so at dinner time it's a bit ridiculous.   Overall, I really liked Hwaro and I'm super excited to take my boyfriend there soon!!"}
{"text":"First timer! Decently priced ayce Korean BBQ. Plenty of variety for meats and side dishes"}
{"text":"A nice AYCE Korean bbq spot with good quality meats and nice selection!  Salad was tasty but the sides were basically same as similar restaurants and would have been nice to have a little more variety.  I went late night around 1 am and it was still busy but maybe due to the Fourth of July and rest of shopping center restaurants were closed.  I would recommend the brisket, beef tongue, pork belly, short ribs, steak and bulgogi.  Very reasonable pricing but didn't like the AYCE pricing difference with beef tongue and short ribs.  Should probably just keep the higher price as standard since most people get the short ribs anyways, lol.  Service was decent as only one server was on duty to take orders and cook meats as well.  I would go back again and recommend Hwaro for your AYCE Korean bbq cravings!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Didn't blow me away, wouldn't say it's the best ramen place in Vegas but for the price, I won't complain. Great service and food comes out very fast."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE KBBQ place!!!! Hands down.  2nd cheapest AYCE KBBQ in town but meat/menu selection is 100% times better than the cheapest place in town. Not exaggerating this place has 40+ things on their menu. While the cheapest one has 15+  items on their menu - i will up date these numbers for more accuracy next time.  Currently $19(happy hour) and $22(regular hour).  Meat Quality: 7/10.... My 10/10 meat quality KBBQ places are usually not AYCE. However, there is only one AYCE KBBQ with better meat quality than this place, all others are equall or below Hwaro. So, it actually is a 9/10 quality among AYCE KBBQ.  My only problem is, this place almost always has a loooooong line during meal times.. but that proves how popular this place is."}
{"text":"This is a decent Korean bbq place. Right balance of price and quality. Be careful ordering pork coz they give u big portions compared to other kbbq place like gen. So that being said u won't need u server most of the time. Their dipping sauce is also better than gen Korean bbq.. plus they include desserts with the price. Win win.."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot, truly a deal for the early morning hours. It gets busy though so keep that in mind. If you do the night menu the brisket is really good. Kalbi is really good as well. The Sh!t is okay but really just feels like a fried sushi roll. Overall among the top kbbq places in the valley"}
{"text":"I LUV KBBQ. The place looks small, but inside is spacious for plenty of people. It smells amazing in here. The price and quality is unbeatable. Just don't wear your finest couture, it'll smell like bulgogi!"}
{"text":"This place is really great!! The service is really friendly and you get a friendly vibe from them. Plus the food is worth the what you pay for!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if we came at a wrong time or something, but this was literally the worst restaurant I've ever been to since I've lived in Vegas. And I go out a decent amount. It first started when we walked in and signed our name to wait for a table. We were told it'll be about 20 minutes. No big deal. After about 15 minutes, my wife and I noticed two other couples that had came in and signed up after us had already been seated. Didn't say anything. Finally they take us to our seat. About 20 minutes, like they said. No complaint on that aspect. We get to our seat and we aren't greeted again for another 20 minutes. During this 20 minutes, we noticed one single waitress going around to every single table in the restaurant and taking orders, filling up drinks, bringing food, etc. One waitress for like 15 tables. When she finally got to us, we ordered 5 different meats because we figured we wouldn't hear from her again for a while. We were right. The meat was very good. The sides are also good. And I'm glad they gave us two carafes for water. So we could give ourselves refills. On 3 separate occasions we asked for orders of different things. Didn't get a single one after about 15 minutes, so we just decided to give up. The worst part is that we saw the busboy bring 2 of those items go to another table in the restaurant. One that just got there. It was blatantly obvious that they hadn't ordered it based on their facial expressions.  But hey, free food. They ate it anyway. After we gave up and went to pay, the same single waitress was also the one working the register. She was working her ass off doing every job in that restaurant almost. And no surprise to me, there was no manager there tonight. I'm not happy to claim this restaurant as my least favorite in Vegas because of all the amazing reviews this place has. But honestly, I found that Tofu Hut (just down the street) is 1000x better that this place. Same concept, but the service is absolutely amazing comparatively. And the food is even better at Tofu Hut."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Be prepared when you arrive to wait up to an hour or mofd, but it's worth the wsit.  Great food great service"}
{"text":"The server was nice and friendly upon arriving.  The table was clean and some side dishes were already there with water bottles and cups.  Overall, we came on a Friday night and the wait was around 10 minutes which is actually pretty fast.  There are plenty of options on the menu, it's sure to satisfied everyone. And best of all, you can't beat their price, all you can eat for $17.95!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone here in the Vegas area and avoid the high prices in the strip."}
{"text":"hwaro is such a cute place! i love the ambiance it presents as well as the service they provide. the food is good quality and their menu grants a nice quantity of choices for all."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat Korean BBQ, but this place I would come back. We were greeted and seated very quickly I'm assuming it was because there's only two of us. The food was good, I love how many sides there was. Our waiter Jayden was very pleasant and on point. I would definitely go back here if I'm ever in the mood again for Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Some fantastic food. We are from San Diego and yelped this place! It has great! Cheap and delicious food! There is so much selection. We got 2 premnium steaks, skirt steak, shake shake rice, \"The Shit\" it was the shit. As I truly recommend Bulgogi Nachos I ordered 2 rounds and we were stuffed!!. Wish I could have orders more but we were waaay too stuff now enjoying some Affogato ice cream and it's delicious! Definitely will some again!!!"}
{"text":"It looked nice on the outside so when we got there I was not surprised when we saw a long line it took a long time to get a table. When we got to the table we got everything like the condiments, sauces, and salad. We ordered beef and pork belly, steak, etc. it was good when we grilled it then we used sauces on the grill like a flavoring for th grill. The service was good but the only thing I did not liked was that when I tried the Green tea smoked pork belly it did not have any taste of green tea. Overall the food was wonderful it was also a good quality and the service was wonderful I would go there again If you are in the area I would suggest this place"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait if you come during peak hours. We waited a little over an hour but we were determined for AYCE Kbbq. Was it worth the wait? Maybe. Would I wait that long again next time? No.  The service was quick and friendly. The food was pretty decent. Everything was good, but nothing was great. With so many amazing korean restaurants in the area, there was nothing that made this place special to me. If I was looking to eat kbbq I wouldn't mind coming here again, but if I was told there was a wait, I would turn around and go to the next kbbq."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place 3 times and each time, the food and service were great; there was also little wait each time I went. Of all the korean bbqs in the area, Hwaro is my first choice. Their Korean bbq meat is very delicious, I especially enjoyed their brisket and beef flank. The service was impeccable as our server, Jayden, was very mindful of our needs such as when we wanted to order more food, needed drink refills and when we needed the grill changed. My only complaint is that their wooden floors can get rather greasy and slippery. It is not a big deal but just something I noticed when I eat there. Other than that, I will be getting my kbbq fixes here and wholeheartedly recommend this place for anyone who is looking to enjoy delicious food under friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came in for my birthday dinner to do the all you can eat special and the service was excellent! They switch out the grill often and come to check on you to make sure that every thing is going well. As far as the food goes it is very good, it comes seasoned for you so that you can just throw it on the grill. I recommend the potato salad. 10/10"}
{"text":"Great services and delicious meats. I was here a year ago for edc and my cousin suggested me to come here. Would love to come more often."}
{"text":"New spot for Korean BBQ!! Nice service and clean feel to all the utensils flatware and salad. Everything tastes delicious even the marinated chicken."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a Friday afternoon,  not bad at all. Reasonably priced, I'll be back. Ps, the spicy pork cannot be beat,  thumbs up."}
{"text":"Always a long long long line. They don't take reservations. Not many side dishes but they have lots of appetizers items and dessert included in AYC. The quality of meat is the same as any other AYC Korean bbq in my opinion"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this k-bbq establishment! Waited maybe 10 minutes or so to be seated. Once we were seated they took out order right away and dishes came out quick and beautifully! We ordered the spicy pork bulgogi which was excellent, spicy pineapple beef which was also full of flavor. Our regular patterns of brisket and short ribs were delicious as well. The customer service here was excellent! People came over right away when we needed them and brought back the items we requested in an instant. The people that work here are very efficient because as soon as we stood to leave they were ready to clean to table and seat the neat party within minutes. I will definitely come back here again because of the excellent service and the marinated meats full of delicious flavor!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I always leave feeling satisfied and super full. I love the atmosphere here. They have cute decor and a interesting theme going on, nothing compared to other kbbq. I feel like they took the time to make this place look decent or well in this case more than decent. It's nice to eat in a place that looks nice... Am I right? It just shows how much they actually care about their customers. Anyways, enough with the rambling let's get to business. I visited this place twice. The first time was when they first opened and the second was just recently. Let me start off by saying how I love how there's not much of a wait here. The most I ever waited to be seated was 10min maximum. (I only came here for dinner) After signing in, they have these booths on the side and chairs for you to sit on while you wait to be seated. This restaurant is spacious and has 10+ grills if I'm not mistaken.  They have A LOT of side dishes... And I mean A LOT. They also have different varieties of meats that set them off from the rest of the other kbbq places, such as baby octopus, pork skin, etc. I always stick to my usual brisket, pork belly and squid. But I was feeling adventurous and tried the marinated baby octopus and pork skin. They were both very delicious! I also love how they have complimentary soy bean paste soup & steamed egg! My faves.  Customer service was very good! All the servers were very nice & always checked up on us.  Overall, I love this place! Totally worth the money. Good food & good service, you can't beat that."}
{"text":"I've always found myself passing by this place - whether it be because I'm heading to Zen Curry or simply because I'm driving down Spring Mountain. In any case, I never had the urge to actually try this place until I received a text from my boyfriend at midnight saying he wants Korean barbecue.  Tofu Hut is our normal go-to place for Korean barbecue and it's always suffice until this very late night.   We walked into Hwaro with empty stomachs, craving and yearning for that delicious Korean barbecue. It was 1:30 in the morning and the waitress welcomed us with open arms. Atlas! A place that wouldn't turn us away. She did warn us that last call to order anything is at 2:00, so we were determined to get our cravings fulfilled. We placed 3 orders of pork belly, 2 orders of brisket, 1 order of short ribs, and 1 order of their steamed egg soup.  There must have been a miscommunication with the pork belly because we only got 2 strips, but that didn't even bother us because we were in awe at our good their brisket tasted. It was enough for us to order 2 more! Their short ribs were perfectly marinated - enough flavor without making it too sweet. Their steamed egg cannot be matched! It was super fluffy with vegetables included inside. I'm literally salivating at the mere thought.  The environment itself had a very rustic Asian feel to it. I felt like I was in a hut with \"rock-like\" walls separating us from the next party. They have a few large sized tables for bigger parties and smaller sized tables for parties of 4 or less. In comparison to Tofu Hut, this place seems bigger.  We ended up leaving this restaurant, fully set that this place has now become our late night spot for Korean barbecue."}
{"text":"This is my second time here with myfamily and friends.Thefirst time ,nothing turned out wrong.Except the food came slow.But me ,and my friends and familyreally appreciate you food."}
{"text":"Fiancé and I stayed in Vegas for 3 days, 2 nights.... And we were so excited about eating this All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ place!!!   We chose the \"All Day Special\" for $21 per person because we absolutely love Kalbi (aka short ribs). We also loved the spicy pineapple steak!!!!!!!   This amazing deal included a list of appetizers and dessert. Both ice cream choices of their desserts was yummy!   Bottom line----Everything we ate here was super delicious (which made me so happy because not all buffets have good quality food).   Did I mention we came here twice during our trip? :P"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite kbbq place! The ayce price is pretty cheap for the quality of meat that you get! Our go-to is the brisket. The skirt steak and the premium steak is always great too! We can't go more than two weeks without stopping by at this point!   The meat is always fantastic and the service is normally pretty fast. They are really good to ask if you would like more meat and they change the grills frequently. This is hands down our go to place for Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"Definitely best Korean bbq I'm the city, my friends always want to meet here and when they call me I always go. I went to this place with open mind and it didnt disappoint so if you like to cook food yourself and eat as much as you can then go to this place. When its busy you have to wait and its ok because it is good. And the servuce is very nice and helpful. That's what you need to do is go to here when you are hungry and eat all you can."}
{"text":"First time going to Korean bbq and I loved it. My little sister introduced me to this little gem. The food was amazing and service was great. Felt comfortable and this place is definitely a favorite. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Read the review in Yelp and headed towards the hotel, first the guy he was not about to welcome, he asked what when I asked for a table for one, another guy told we don't serve for one, that's really weird. I don't think so it's true."}
{"text":"Great service! Quality meat and lots of great choices. Really reasonable price! The amount of food we got, for $20, really a steal!   It was 12 a.m and got a small rush and I think there was only one server but she was really nice and patient with us. We were all really starving, a little hangry and it was the 3rd All-you-can-eat Korean BBQ we went to since all the other ones we went to wasn't doing the all you can eat anymore, just Ala carte (dumb, right?!) but later we all agreed that it was the best one we've been to and it was worth it.   Our favorite ones was fat ass, pork ribs, squid and beef tongue. The side dish with jalapeños and radish ( we think they were radish) and the onions were to die for! Fat ass (wine pork) was a great amount of juicy fat and some marinated meat! My mouth is watering again just thinking of all the delicious food we had last night. Definitely will go back again and take the rest of our family there!"}
{"text":"This is the best Korean BBQ I've had. The staff is fast and responsive and the price is very low for what you get.  High quality meat! I'll give this restaurant ++++++ stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good service, friendly server, excellent food and beverages! Will recommend to everyone! Perfecto."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try the shake shake rice and the Shit! You wont regret it! Good food, good people, great place to hang out and enjoy."}
{"text":"** If you write a review here, you get a free beer or drink, but I still stand by my review and I would come back. Also, I didn't even finish my beer.  **  Came in at about 10:45 pm on a Friday night. The wait was about 10 minutes. Not that bad. Busy / crowded parking lot.  I came back to the same plaza the next night and there were a lot of people waiting outside, so maybe we just got really lucky. Not sure if they take reservations, but write your name down when you go in.  The lettuce and veggie bowl are both pretty good. Lots of side dishes for you. And an all you can eat menu. :~) Yay!!  For lunch and late nights, there's an all you can eat buffet menu for $17.95, which is amazing!! To eat everything on the menu, it's $20.95.  The meat is really good and they change the metal plate for you every time. Also order their shake shake rice!! Really good, but not one order per table. They have so many options to choose from.  Things that we've ordered so far:  - Green tea smoked pork belly (Didn't taste the green tea but it was still good) - Regular pork belly - Brisket (Yum!) - Hwaro Spicy Pork Rib (Also yum!) - The Shit (Ugh, sooo good. I thought we were limited to only one, but I misread the menu. Getting more of these next time. Also the sauce is amazinggg.) - Shake shake rice (Get this too)  I think we order about 8 meats for 2 people and we were stuffed after. My bf ended up eating a lot of white rice LOL. It was his first time eating KBBQ.  Out of all the KBBQ's I've eaten in my life, this place is one of my favorites.  Customer service is pretty good. A bit hard to get the waiter's attention sometimes, but I think it's partly because there's more tables than employees.  Also, get dessert. Because why not???"}
{"text":"This place is really good it's literally \"the shit\", the shit is a must try, strongly recommended this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten kbq at many places The meat is good.  Finally. Found one that has rice paper Other than the wait i am going to be here on a regular bases. Ya gotta try \"the shit\"  bomb Best i have had in vegas."}
{"text":"First time i was here they didn't have a liquor license but now they do. Food is really good and is the best deal on Korean BBQ in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Taste: 2 Creativity/Authenticity: 3 Atmosphere: 4 Service: 1.5 Bang for your buck: 3  I'd have to say this is probally the worst kbbq I have ever had. But that's a bold statement; why would I say that we'll let's start. We came in Monday around 5 the parking lot was packed so understandable, the restaurant was kinda busy but not due to customers but the fact that they only had 2 servers taking care of the whole restaurant so it's safe to say bad service. Next was the food, we got an order of beef tongue; brisket and short ribs... probally some of the worst cuts of meat I've ever had, the tongue had the consistency of a rubber band and tasted like it too, the brisket was also very chewy and had a flavor of freezer burn and last the short ribs which ever way I tried to cook it rare, medium rare still chewy and very hard to swollow! The atmosphere of this place is nice, open space nice decor. Overall I'll wait the 1 and a half to eat at my favorite kbbq next time so much for trying new places"}
{"text":"Great food and great service... Much better price than the kbbq in LA... The quality is also good"}
{"text":"We waited around 1 hr 15 min on a Saturday to get seated at 3 PM. Our first time here. We thought we'd miss the lunch time crowd and maybe we did. Just expect to wait is what I am warning any other newbies!  I wanted to just tell our waitress, \"Miss, just bring whatever and keep it coming\" because we hadn't had anything to eat yet that day. We ended up with the sweetest Filipina waitress and she somehow remembered everything we wanted, which was a lot! God bless her. Everything was brought to us quickly. They seriously have efficiency down and work as a team.   I was expecting their short ribs to be marinated, maybe I was supposed to use the sauce in the squeeze bottle? Anyway, it didn't even matter. We inhaled everything...pork belly, short ribs, steak, etc. Quality is well above average. All the employees hustle to serve you pleasantly and quickly. What more can you ask for really for $22, AYCE?  So many things can go awry when a customer is famished and when everything is so perfectly executed, it makes for a great experience!!!! Thank you. We'll def be back."}

{"text":"Alright sooooo, this updated review spans a year and a half and about twenty visits later.  The first time I ever came here I didn't really like it. And then, I grew fond of it. Only because with each time I learned something new and liked the taste a whole lot better. My coworkers always wanted to come here often because of the price. The late night is like $20 and the all day special is $23. I swear it used to be cheaper but who knows. They usually have rice paper but last night they ran out. The steamed egg is one order per TABLE and not person (which sucks). The meat quality is pretty good though. Not top notch, but so-so for what you're paying. They're pretty busy but service goes quickly. I really like the tall guy, he's super nice always changes the grill when needed. I don't really like their sides as much as other places, but I like the sauce that they have for dipping."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and never wrote a review because it was the only one I had ever been to. I went to another one the other night, not AYCE, and it does not compare to this place. They have great flavored food, plenty of options and service is good also. Only down side is this place ALWAYS has a wait, even at midnight."}
{"text":"It is too bad that I have to give this place a 1 star review despite that I kind of like some of their food. It's pretty good price for AYCE. They have very interesting items on their menu such as the KFC and the shake shake rice that I enjoyed.   Our last visit we came in at 10:30 pm and the place was PACKED. We waited around 40 minutes or so until we're finally seated. Food was decent as usual and their service was always on the slower side because it's a busy place.   When we were finished with our meal and were about to pay, the server saw that we're doing split check and told us split check can only be done at the cashier. I found it odd at the moment because we've done split check before at this place and had the server brought us back the check. We did not think much at the time and left our table and went to the cashier. At the cashier they told us that their system went down and they could not do credit card at the moment. It was a late night dinner and none of the people in our party had cash. There was a woman working there that seemed to be the manager. We asked them how long the wait would be and she told us she's on the phone with COX and they're doing some maintenance and it would be finished in around 10 minutes to an hour. We asked them if they could do any alternative payment method such as Venmo, Paypal or even call the credit card company to do the transaction manually. However they refused to offer any help and asked us to go find an ATM at 12:30 am. We live 20 minutes away from this place and it would take us 40 minutes to go back and forth if we were to go home and get cash so we decided to wait a little and see.  They held our credit cards captive and had us sit at the extremely small waiting area. It was very windy that night and every time someone opened the door a gush of wind would come in and we were freezing. Now that we thought about it the server basically tricked us to leave our table so we would not occupy a table while they sorted things out.   We waited for 30 minutes and it was now 1 am and we had no idea how much longer it would take. We decided to leave one person there and go home to get cash. Soon after we left the parking lot our friend called to tell us that the system was back up and we should come back. When we came back they already finished all the transactions without offering any form of compensation for the inconvenience. They were not one bit apologetic and the manager went home way before the situation was resolved. This is unacceptable customer service to me and I would not recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Love this place go for every occasion I can only have had one problem here and it was handled not to my liking but the waitress was so nice you just didn't care ."}
{"text":"I went here last year with my bro and cousins during EDC weekend and it was my cousin who lived in Vegas introduced me to this place.The food and service were amazing. That's why we stop at hwaro again this year."}
{"text":"I came here to eat after a convention. They told me that they don't set up for just one customer. First time I've ever heard that. So if you're solo don't bother."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and girlfriend (parents and I have never been, girlfriend is a veteran of this place, said it's her favorite KBBQ place in Vegas).  I made a reservation the night before which didn't make much of a difference because we had to wait about 5 minutes, no big deal.  I immediately liked the fact that the table already had tools and utensils set up.  We all got AYCE and ordered brisket, beef flank, pork belly, tongue, chicken, squid and spare ribs.  ALL OF IT WAS BOMB!  My personal favorites were the spare ribs and the flank.  I also loved that the meats were fresh, NOT FROZEN.  Tofu Hut has frozen meats when I go there and there's not as much flavor.  I think Hwaro's meats are better than Tofu Hut's.  Where Hwaro may not match up are it's sides.  The sides are standard (kimchi, seaweed, fish cakes, etc.)  I do think Tofu Hut's sides are little better, but the KBBQ is the main reason anyone goes to these restaurants.  We also ordered some of the Sh_t (it's really that good, get it!), some Popcorn chicken (good) and got some ice cream.  I want to give props to the servers because they really stay on top of things.  Changing the grills constantly, refilling our waters, asking if we want anything else and they're pretty friendly.  If you haven't been to Hwaro but you've been to other KBBQ places in Vegas, give this place a try.  My parents, who don't go to these kind of places often, had a great time and enjoyed their meal so that made me and my girlfriend happy.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was great and price is awesome !! the owner is humble with her customers. They have a special sauce for the meat that is ready to eat. It was spectacular. Bottomline I recommend this place if you're looking for AYCE KBBQ"}
{"text":"This AYCE kbbq place was really good. They had a lot of selections for the $22.95 selection. Since it was our first time here, the servers were very nice and helpful. Their appetizers were really good and they often changed the grills. My party of 8 was seated in 15 min or less but then again, we were the first costumers. I like how they also serve you a choice of dessert at the end unlike other AYCE Kbbq .   Try the padak & egg (super fluffy) .  4 stars because it was hot in there"}
{"text":"Delicious place. Everyone is super attentive and nice. The meats and selection are super yummy. Plus the cheese with corn was like heaven."}
{"text":"Always good service! I love their all day all you can eat selection. Only $20.95 with over 52 items to choose from. \"The shit\", steamed egg, and shake shake rice are bomb! Soju selection is good and staff friendly. Even when there was a wait, I was sitting inside and she'd ask our name and inform us of how long more. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and the guys were hungry so we upgraded to the dinner menu which was $20. Our group got split up into 2 separate tables because each table only had one grill. (Even for 6-8 seaters.) We were here for the food, so no big deal.  (For large parties, this might not be the best place for get togethers.)  It seems like a small family shop and they did everything themselves. The service was slow...which was understandable since there was only one server for the entire restaurant. There was probably a total of 4 workers. The menu isn't too long so you will get a chance to try them all. It was a bit hard ordering with our server because she doesn't write the orders down. So not all our orders got through the first time around. The portions were small... so I highly suggest to order ahead or prepare to wait. We were starving!   Premium orders are one per person. The skipped out on a lot of our orders that were suppose to be complimentary for dinner cost (Not clearly mentioned on the menu.) The menu says dessert was included and when we asked.. our server said \"not today\". Okay... so no dessert.   Since our table got split into 2 groups with 2 separate bills we still got charged for 18% gratuity. Hard to justify ... (*Feeling MEH)  We really tried to enjoy our meal, only there were so many small things that bothered us. I can't help but knock out a few stars for this place. Its a hit or miss... Its not the best place to go for kbbq in vegas but the meat quality was still good for the price."}
{"text":"Korean vibe is strong!  Our favorite all you can eat Korean BBQ place in Las Vegas. Located in Seoul Plaza (where you can find Raku, Sweets Raku, Monta Ramen, and Trattoria Nakamura-Ya).   We liked everything that we've tried from the menu.  Been here a few times and we always receive excellent service from their staff. Especially this girl named Janice... Seriously! This girl does not slow down. She was working all the tables the last time we were there.   Must get: Brisket, Beef bulgogi, Green Mussel, Premium Steak (1 order per person), Enoki Beef (1 order per person), Korean Fried Chicken, The Shit, and Shake Shake Rice.   Writing this review is making me crave for \"the shit\". Probably heading there for dinner tonight."}
