{"text":"Great burger deals on Sundays.  Patchy service and patchy beer availability sometimes. Food is great when they aren't busy but inconsistent when it is busy.    Atmosphere is cool. Love the music videos when sports aren't on!  Patio is okay. Little loud and lacking in comfy chairs.   Has the makings of a great local pub that hasn't ironed out the kinks yet."}
{"text":"Blah. It gets worse every time I come. No more. I'll drive a little further and eat much better.  I think after construction is done in this area you will lose a lot of business with trades people going elsewhere.  By the way...heating/defrosting your hamburger buns in a microwave is just GROSS."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night with some girlfriends. I got The special was fish and chips for $11. The fish was a very good size and the fish was flaky and fresh!  Will be back to try other specials."}
{"text":"The bar name sounds a bit misleading and offering Poor Beer and and Wine...until you see the spelling as Pour...which then sounds more fitting.  First impressions of the bar are positive and  very nice. You'll never know of it unless you happen to stumble upon it or happen to be in Evanston and searching for restaurants.   The staff were slightly fresh and must have been new but the food was really tasty and above average pub food. Their Strombolis and pizza crust are seriously really good and worth making the trip to try. It's definitely much better then you would expect. Thumbs up for the best pizza and Strombolis.  Oh, one more thing... Their Beef Dip was amazing too... Hands down the best. So delicious!  Will come again and recommend to try it out. Foods much better then Tudor Rose."}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of the strip plaza/mall in Evanston is Pour. Plenty of parking in front as well as a bike rack.   Our waitress was great, gave us the menu, asked of it was our first time there and told us about the food, specials and beer menu. We did advise her we were there for a quick lunch and it was no problem.   There are plenty of beers on tap which is amazing however I don't drink beer so this is a great feature for others who do. They had a variety on the food menu as well as specials on certain days/nights.   I had a chicken wrap with a house salad. It was very good. My client had a Maui burger with kettle chips which he raved about how good it was. I did try some of the kettle chips and would definitely recommend them. Will come back to try the wings and pizza since I noticed it at another table and it looked delicious.  They have great lunch specials and everything was reasonably priced and service was fast. Our waitress was very friendly and made my first time at Pour enjoyable. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week thought a nice local pub should be good. But they had very few beers on tap I ordered a flight and asked for whatever they thought was good. The bartender could not tell me what 4 draughts he brought me and was rude to me when I asked. The food did not taste fresh at all and very overpriced. Will not go back here or recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Not our first time at this pub/restaurant.  Very nice and clean interior.  Prices though have gone up.  We were there last weekend to watch a pay per view event. Ordered nachos and wings.  Both tasted good, though a little bit pricier than some pubs , say in the Panorama area.  The service was good, no make them, too good as our server kept coming back every ten minutes asking us if we needed more drinks even though she knew she just dropped off a couple a few minutes ago.  After a couple of hours, she stated that she had to \"ring us out\" as she was ending her shift. How is this our problem?  Her colleagues could have given her the tips at a later time rather than pestering us for orders and then ringing us out. Paging the manager....."}
{"text":"Came here in a Sunday. Caesars were in special so we had some. They were very tasty  For food we had the Capri pizza and asked for a thin crust. It was quite good. Will definitely come back to try the pizza again.   Service was really good as well but to be honest there wasn't a lot of ppl in there."}
{"text":"Oh dear, where to begin.  I ordered the fish tacos and it was absolutely terrible. It was slaughtered in spicy sauce (that had no flavour), but was in my best guess, used to mask what little taste the tacos had. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it....   My server was probably a 15 year old, and this gig is probably her first job. She kept \"checking up on us\", but every time she came over to ask how we were doing, I would have to give her a friendly reminder and ask her for more water (when every time she approached us, my glass was half empty). My friend asked for ice (because the water was room temperature), which would've been the first hint that the water being served is too warm. However, she never took that hint and continued to serve the same pitcher of warm water.  At the end of my meal, I went to the washroom and came out to see my server hiding out in the washroom texting on her phone....  Terrible food and terrible service. I wouldn't come back nor recommend this place. You're better off at a Wendy's."}
{"text":"It's a really nice place and it's clean and the food is ok. What I have an issue with is the portion sizes in relation to what they charge. $16 for the thinnest chicken quesadilla I have ever had and it came with nothing - NO fries or salad or anything. This place is simply too expensive for a pub. It's pretty obvious people have clued in to this because it's never busy especially at lunch. Sorry, I really want to like it but I'm going to start going elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've never written a review for any restaurant before, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. We waited over 45 minutes for food that was clearly sitting under a heat lap, because \"the kitchen forgot to cook rice.\"   We let our server know that the quality of our food was absolute crap (crusty bread, hard cheese curds, a gross layer over Thai curry), and did the manager come by to address this issue? Of course not, instead he avoided our table like the plague.   So, we went to him directly for the bill to which he said \"I heard your food wasn't that great.\" When he brought the bill he let us know that he didn't charge us for any of the food, and then completely blamed the kitchen for everything. I then responded that it's actually the responsibility of the front and back of house to ensure that the quality of food is edible. What did the manager say? \"well we don't know if the food they put up is edible, we don't eat it, we just serve it.\"   ZERO accountability for a \"manager.\" Apparently he doesn't believe in using words to communicate? Should a customer really being telling a manager that it's also his fault? I think not.  Anyways, the Popeyes next door is great!"}
