{"text":"This place is good. You can bring your own wine. It's perfect for us since we only go to theese places. My wife takes the crispy noodles and she finds them perfect also. I gave 4 stars because the portions are small and the service is slow considering that there is no other clients when we go in the week. The hot and spicy soup is very good."}
{"text":"This place used to be located at the corner of Corbusier/Dagenais street, in Laval. It was then closed down for unknown reason. Saddened, as we finally have a decent Chinese restaurant not far from home, but not for long, we were happy to have found out they reopened on Cure-Labelle.  It used to be more of a Chinese-oriented restaurant, plates to share but with their reopening it became more of an \"Asian fusion\" concept with individual meals (i.e smaller portion of main dish with a side of rice). We tried 5 different plates in total (fried rice, sautéed noodles, chicken with red curry, chicken with sautéed Thai style and the general tao). They were all tasteful except the general Tao, crust too thick. They also offer the option of having Pho, Vietnamese soup, in their menu. Would return to have a try.  Small private parking lot available. And it is also a BYOW."}
{"text":"Nice quaint typical Asian place with decent ambience. I will start with the good, wonton soup. The less good aka bad is this place does not serve beer or wine, the crispy noodles were crisp for 11 seconds before they soaked up way too much broth which tasted ok but defeats the crispy effect.   This is borderline place that I'd think twice about returning. Maybe i ordered wrong thing?? Anyway, Thai express has nothing to worry about from this independent local place."}
