{"text":"I wanted to like Pacini. I thought I'd try it out for breakfast since their menu looked interesting. We arrived and were seated within 5 minutes but it took another 30 minutes for someone to take our order. When we did order, the food was ok but was not as listed on the menu. Some items were missing from the dishes. After eating, we waiting another 30 minutes for our bill and then another 30 to pay it. Apparently 3/4 of the restaurant staff didn't show up. That made for a two hour long breakfast, with bad service and the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Myself and my family really enjoyed our meal and would go back again. Great service and we loved the bread bar. Our meals came fast and were delicious.  We finished the meal with deserts I recommend the limoncello lemon dolci."}
{"text":"This place is like a higher end East Side Mario's.  The grill your own bread bar is kind of cheesy for a place that's trying to be classy.  In all the food was ok, but could be better.  The service was bad, we waited 10 minutes before someone took our drink order.  I live downtown, so to drive all the way out to North East Calgary for this would be a complete wast of time and gas."}
{"text":"Don't let the Hotel Restaurant description fool you: Pacini is one Calgary's gems.  Attached to the Acclaim Hotel on Barlow and Country Hills in the NE, Pacini is, by definition, a Hotel Restaurant. However that is where any and all likeness to the typical \"Hotel Restaurant\" association ends. What is Pacini then? An Italian restaurant that excels in customer service, is both lavish and casual with an atmosphere that can be suited for almost any occasion, and offers meals and a dining experience that are guaranteed to please.   First, the service. Some of the finest and a most courteous hosts and servers i've come into contact with. The staff here is kind, courteous, and are the type who actually smile when they see you; you get the sense that they really care about your dining experience and that kind of genuineness is hard to come by.  Second, the atmosphere and design. The restaurant has a bar and a dining area, with their unique Bread Bar grill (more on that to come) located in the dining area. From the second you walk in, you realize this place may a be a little fancier than you bargained for-- but that isn't a problem, it'll probably be one of the pluses on your list for this place at the end of the night. The walls are adorned with pictures and landscapes of Italy; the decor is modern, with comfortable seating in the dining area and equally comfortable but more sophisticated seating towards the bar (i'm told there are private booths for those looking for a more cozy dining experience). Unlike other restaurants, Pacini has a unique task in having to definitely cater to a variety of crowds but also maintain it's fine-dining agenda. Acclaim being the sole hotel north of the Airport, the hotel sees an assortment of travellers and guests (and their kids), all of which no doubt eat at Pacini. If you are eating in the dining area, you will probably see people dressed very casually dining with their kids, but i assure you it won't be too distracting. It's rather comforting to see families not stressing about keeping their kids ultra quiet because the kids are actually busy eating or even making their own food. This is where the Bread Bar comes in, a unique Pacini experience; the bar offers a variety of all you can eat breads that are to be topped with your choice of specialty butters (garlic, tomato basil, etc) and grilled to your liking. Friends, family, and I personally love the idea, it's something that makes your meal truly memorable because it shifts your meal from being a passive sit-and-eat experience, into a more personal and engaging event. There's always lots of smiles and eager deliberation around the Bread Bar which will carry over once seated and when going over the menu.   When it comes the menu, it can be a little confusing at first, but once explained, you may come to appreciate the setup. The idea of the Duos (a half pasta / half pizza meal, designed for one individual) is novel. For those looking to get a little bit of the best of both worlds, i'd suggest this as a starting meal as the pasta and pizza here are great. Although it appears most of the menu is composed of traditional Italian items, there is something for everyone that is sure to please. The prices too are also rather pleasing, as you may expect to pay more for the level of elegance and quality food, the moderate pricing is fair at the very least.  Pacini is one of the restaurants that will surprise you on a number of levels and it's level of excellence in service, atmosphere, and food will leave you thinking it was one your finest and most enjoyable dining experiences you've had yet. Although it's tucked away in the North, it is most definitely worth the trip. Easily one of my favourite places to eat in the city, I'd recommend it for any occasion. 5 Stars.  *on a personal note about service, we only mentioned as an aside to our server that it was one of our guest's irthday that night and they came out with a staff-led birthday celebration at the end of our meal after desert, marching birthday music, a slice of birthday cake--everything! Although it was miss-timed (our friend was in the bathroom when the celebration music and march started -- she came running out of the bathroom to hear what all the commotion was about, literally lol) it lead to plenty of laughs and even more of a priceless night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great ambiance .... Service not so good ... But not horrible ..... Ordered the surf and turf 8 oz asked for medium for my steak got a steak so over done it was hard to eat guess I should have ordered it rare"}
{"text":"I don't think I would go back to Pacinis again. They offer a glutin free menu, but they don't offer glutin free desert or they just didn't want to go out of their way to give me anything. I went there November 23rd with a big gathering and they had really good service until desert time. Everyone else had desert except for those who were glutin free. I didn't miss much because the desert they had wasn't all that good anyway except the ice cream and the tiny little amount of tiramisu cake piece they had. They are also pretty expensive. I don't mind paying extra if they follow with good service all they way through serving me."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food was awesome. I devoured my chicken. I had fries which at first I was alittle thrown off by but after I figured out that it isn't a one fry at a time thing it was so much better. I would return in a heart beat. The only issue I had was the waitress needed to bring the pepper and cheese out with her. That's it."}
{"text":"Great spot near the airport. A must for those on the way out of town. Kid friendly but nice enough for couples. The bread bar is a unique idea and the calamari was super good. Service was good and selection was decent. I would give 3 1/2 but a half star was not an option."}
{"text":"I have been to Pacini more then a few times as it is close to my office and have had both very good and not so good experiences. As far as the food is concerned, it is always very good and the bread bar seems to be a hit with everyone. On the service side of things, now that has left something to be desired on more then one occasion. Tonight was my most recent experience at Pacini and again the food was good but the service ranked from poor to very poor. First our waitress left out table before everyone had given her a drink order, and then when she brought the drinks she forgot my wife's wine. Then when our food came out my wife's order was totally incorrect and while the waitress went to correct the order she left half our table's food orders on the serving tray sitting out in the isle with people walking by it for about 5 minutes. By the time my wife's correct came out, part of our table were almost completely finished eating. Even once we all had our food correctly the waitress never came around to ask how the food was or if anyone needed anything else to drink be it a cocktail or even more water. All in all it was a disappointing evening for the price."}
{"text":"An average quality Italian American eatery,  inside an airport hotel. Respectable wine by the glass for $7, well prepared seafood linguine. What raises the rating to 3.5 is 1)  the bread bar, where you grill various types of bread with compound butter to your heart's content, and 2) a nice West facing patio with comfy sofas. Not a bad choice if you're in the NE and want some pasta."}
{"text":"We came here since it is near the airport and we wanted something to eat before departing to Banff.  Someone said they liked this place because of their bread bar.  It was 'ok'.  We were there for lunch and order from the lunch menu.  Had the kale salad with minestrone soup and the pizza with prosciutto and arugula.  The kale salad had a nice grapefruit vinaigrette.  The soup was thinner than I'm used to, and light on pasta, flavor ok, but not real flavorful.  The pizza was perhaps a bit under cooked not not really crisp for a thin crust.   The bread bar for us, was disappointing. We're from the San Francisco area, and have a difference expectation when we hear there's a bread bar at an Italian restaurant.   Service was attentive.  Parking lot had plenty of spaces."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a nice change from boston pizza type restaurants. I really enjoyed it, however, it still kind of felt like a boston pizza. Just upscaled. It is an extremely nice looking restaurant inside and really big too. I had the lasangna and it was really good actually, but still boston pizza-ish. My friend had the fettucine alfredo with some pancetta or something. It was ok. They have this bread bar thing. You pick out your type of bread and butter it, then put it on a grill. Everyone stands around the grill watching their bread toast, which was hilarious to me. It is a neat quirk, but would be annoying if it was busy I think. Then you are walking around all these people etc. I would recommend this place though. The food was good and the price was decent."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant with an Italian feel if you want to escape the line ups at the Olive Garden. My biggest issue is location. It is out of the way, far north past the airport, and there is virtually no parking on the restaurant side of the hotel it attatches to, so be prepared for a hike through a gravel parking lot to get to the front doors after you park.  It is a different type of expereince, starting with a Grill It Yourself bread bar. The menu is nothing fancy, but the meals they do have are done very well, however more casual than anything.  I would definately return, but don't think that this will be my first choice when looking for a quick bite out at a sit down venue."}
{"text":"Went to my favourite restaurant with my daughter on Father's Day. Used to love going here but they have changed their menu & their prices. They are gouging customers now. Some of the dishes went up 5 to 8 dollars. I had the basic spaghetti with one meatball and water my daughter had a salad & a glass of wine. My bill was $48 dollars!!  They charged me for the one meatball plus melting cheese on the spaghetti!  I always loved this place. The bread bar was so nice. But I'm not going to pay these prices because their rent went up? All restaurants have raised their prices because everything has gone up in price - but give me a break. Raise them a dollar or two - not gouging!"}
{"text":"Margherita Pizza was good.  Lasagna was ok....NOT great but ok.  Bread bar was very good.  Chocolate cake good but very pricey for what you get.  Tiramisu was the worst  Tiramisu I have ever had.  It was a very small portion of a mushy mess in a bowl with whipped cream slathered on the top.  Only three tiny chunks of dry lady fingers hidden in the mess and I was charged almost $8 for it.  Horrible."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here was just after it opened.  We were staying at the hotel and it was convenient.  We were very happy with our meals and the service was terrific.  About a year ago we moved to the area and since we had been so impressed by our first meal, we took my parents there for a nice Italian dinner.  It was awful.  I kept apologizing to my parents, telling them over and over that the first time we ate at Pacinis it was great.  The pasta was undercooked and flavourless, the pizza was bland and my mother's meal was cold.  When we mentioned it to the waitress and she offered us desserts, we accepted the tiramisu and it was disgusting, like it had been made weeks ago, stale to the point of being almost sour.   I said then that I wouldn't eat there again.    Tonight I was craving pasta and apparently a year is enough time for a lapse in memory.  I wanted fettuccini Alfredo and my husband was craving pizza.  We opted for take out because we had a busy week and we're looking forward to dinner and a movie at home.  When my husband ordered the food I asked him to make sure they didn't skimp on the sauce so he asked that they put extra sauce on my pasta.  He ordered the marghareta pizza with pepperoni.    When he returned home with the food I first observed that there was no garlic toast with my pasta.  They have an all you can eat bread bar in the restaurant but takeout gets a smaller serving and no bread.  I opened the cardboard box to discover that despite the 3.50$ charge for \"extra sauce\" the pasta was dry and stuck to the paper at the bottom of the container.  I decided it didn't matter, I could deal with a small portion and picked the pasta off the paper and put it on a plate thinking if the food tasted good that was all that mattered.  I might as well have eaten the box.  It could not possibly have had any less flavor than the Alfredo sauce.  The box may also have been easier to chew.  I understand al dente but this was more like a shredded tire. My husband didn't fare much better.  He paid more for the four paper thin rounds of pepperoni than he did for my \"extra sauce.\"  The pie itself was cold and very small for the price.  It cost us $32 for what amounts to a personal size pizza and a regular cereal bowl of pasta.  If the food had even been decent I am happy to spend the money, this however was a complete waste and a total disappointment.   Many people seem very impressed by the bread bar but the gimmick doesn't even begin to make up for the lack of effort in the kitchen.   Pacinis is a mistake I won't make again."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place and randomly stopped for lunch.  Wow what a score! You get to hit the bread bar with most meals. Multiple types of bread and a variety of spreads and a gas grill to toast em up.  The only problem is that the menu is too big...like 4 pages of just pasta....took me forever to choose.  I went with the Oceana Cannelloni.  Fresh pasta stuffed with Salmon, scallops and covered in a rose sauce.  The portion size was perfect and I like how each dish gets there own little cast iron pan and baked separately as opposed to a big pan of each pasta that has to be separated.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area and need a carbo load"}
{"text":"Smells good, looks good, but tastes.... Okay! The only thing this place really has going for itself is the awesome bread grill! What a fantastic idea! Everyone loves it...it's for the bread loving, butter soaking, grill masters! Eat all types of breads and flavoured breads while you wait for your main course.   I've been here a couple times...figured I would try this place a second time because the bread buffet was so good. It sure starts your dining experience off on a good note. What could go wrong? Well, tasteless below average entrees could take it down a notch....and slow service with high prices could take it down another notch.   Overall, you gotta take the good with the bad. The bad are the seriously horrible pizzas! The good is....did I say bread? Well, if you're gluten free or watching your weight, it may all be bad.  Anyways, the experience is different and the atmosphere is nice...so give it a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Defintion of average. Nothing was bad but nothing was great. The food was good and the bread bar was a cool addition, but there's nothing that made me want to go back."}
{"text":"Make your own garlic bread station! Can I just have bread for dinner? I'm sure the servers have to learn not to roll their eyes every time someone says that lol  You have your choices of basic Italian appetizers (such as bruschetta and calamari), and pasta and flatbreads for your entrees. I highly recommend the linguine diavoliva with grilled shrimp, that is if you're not too full from the \"all you can eat\" garlic bread ;)  In addition to a fully functioning restaurant, they also have a small marketplace set up by the door so you can pick up any ingredients if you want to make your own Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Took my family from out of town here. My sisters kids loved the bread bar (fresh bread you toast on a big grill and with garlic and other spreads to put on it). Food and service was good. Especially enjoyed the shrimp."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere? Check Unique bread bar?  Check on a cheat day Great drinks? Check, give the italian cocktails a try, great stuff Excellent food?  Nope Good food? Check, it's still pretty tasty but doesn't that the authentic Italian quality and freshness that you might be expecting, pretty good overall  Overall a fun experience at reasonable prices. I would go back."}
{"text":"Great bread bar everything else sucked .. Don't bother coming here if you want good pasta. Also our waiters pizza suggestion was the worst"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Wouldn't serve me chicken parm sandwich after dinner. Told me to order the pasta because \"it's the same thing\"  Only redeeming quality was the bread bar."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in the town. Every thing about this place was 5 stars... Be it food, service or the ambiance. They had good wine selection ad well..."}
{"text":"I have always had a good meal.  Bread bar is by far my favorite.  Kids meals are a good size. My big kids are satisfied and the 3 yr old's bunny pizza was a perfect amount.  I will come again."}
{"text":"After my flight canceled, we were looking for someplace close to the airport where we could get something quickly. This restaurant is attached to an airport area hotel and was easy to get to.  My girl had the grilled shrimp and sirloin surf and turf. The steak was tender and the shrimp were surprisingly large. She chose gnocchi in a creamy tomato sauce as a side, and it was very good. I opted for the veal scallopini di parma. The meat was perfectly seasoned and presented in a nice sauce. I thought the linguine was a little bland, but some of the chili infused olive oil at the table took care of that.  One of the features of this chain is the self-serve bread bar. There are six different breads to choose from and spreads to go along with them. A community grill is located next to the bread for custom toasting once you make your selection. I didn't like that some of the name tags were missing, and I had to guess at some of the selections. I also was a little disappointed that they used margarine instead of real butter. Otherwise, a nice touch."}
{"text":"Friends were staying at the hotel on their stop over in Calgary so we ventured to something close for them so they didnt have to worry about driving. Even though this place is on the other side of town for us, we are always willing to try something new.  We arrived and could not find parking. You would think since this restaurant is on the main floor of a hotel, they would have plenty of parking. Sadly we had to do a few laps around and found parking....very far away. Fail.   Had reservations with a small group. 5 adults + 1 child.  The restaurant is nice and great decor. It was busy and not sure why since its a Tuesday night and well after \"normal dinner hours\"?  We were seated promptly at a table. Menus were dropped off and drink ordered taken. Ordered a couple bottles of red wine for the table and apple juice for the child.   Wine and juice arrived and then our waiter left. We already all knew what we wanted since while he was away getting wine, we made our choice. Not sure if all the menus stalked at the end of the table threw him off or he wasn't ready to take our order? No idea? 25 minutes later he returned..... \" Are you ready to order?\" Not sure if that's a trick question but hey, we are ready.  Waitor isn't overly friendly at all.  3 orders of pizza, 1 fettuccine Alfredo and 1 chicken parmigiana. As well as a kids pasta. All very easy orders and ordered quickly. We don't mess around when we are hungry!  The restaurant started to clear out now and it was no longer that busy.  We noticed by our table, some sort of buffet and patrons going up and back to their table. We had no idea what it was so asked one of the waitresses passing by. She explained it was a garlic bread station where you can make your own garlic bread and it's included in your meal. She said that when our waiter/waitress takes our order they will explain it to you. We advised her our waiter already took our order and he didn't explain anything nor did he even talk to us. Just took our order and left. She seemed perplexed? Not sure why?  Eventually our food arrived...40 minutes later. Oy! What a gong show, but we are all too hungry to complain to anyone at this point.  The margaretta pizza was so stiff and hard that sawing it with a knife wasn't working well. It seems that all three pizza's ordered, even though different kinds were all over cooked. FAIL. The fettuccine and chicken parmigiana were great. Mental note - should have ordered the pasta! Why did I order a pizza? Because I thought it would be quick.   Didn't see our waiter during dinner nor did he replenish our wine since delivered when we arrived at the restaurant. Everyone finished dinner and we sat. Well except for the 3 of us who ordered pizza, most was not eatten at all. We just nibbled on the other two's pasta.  Our lovely waiter showed up and with the bill????  No mention if we wanted dessert or more wine, just the bill. So we knew that was our queue to leave. He asked if we wanted boxes for the pizza since it was hardly eatten? Our lovely, out of town guest stated that all the pizzas were really over cooked and hard and none of us would be taking them home. They were horrible. His queue could have been an apology, maybe offer to take it off the bill, maybe even offer us dessert but all he said was \"that's too bad\". He left the bill and left.....  We knew we may never see him again and would be stuck. So we went and paid at the front. I told the hostess that our waiter wasn't really that great and that is why I was paying in front since he may never return for us to pay and we just wanted to leave. She rang it up and didn't offer any communication or an apology for the lack of service.  All very disappointing. Dinner at this place was not cheap. Entree's ranged from $18 - $35 for pizza and pasta and surly was not worth it. Between the horrible service and the food, I don't think I would make the trek to this place again. So much better options in the NE by the airport and this place isn't it. FAIL."}
{"text":"There is no lower rating than one. Here is some of what I wrote the company:   The night started for our party of 11 with an offer to sit in a setting made for 8. After explaining our dilemma, which should have been blatantly obvious to the most inexperienced persons, we were informed to try and \"squeeze in\". We were hoping that was a joke but disappointingly, it was not. This was, of course, after we had confirmed our reservation for 11. Not just confirmed our party of 11 once, not even confirmation of our party of 11 twice, but THREE times! Usually, thats all you get at bat but this horror show is just beginning. Perhaps 30 - 45 mins later, after the restaurant cleared a bit after our 7:30pm reservation, we were offered a larger table. OK, so our night started off poorly (well, lets just say poorly is too mild a word and it would be more appropriately deemed bad already). We had hopes that things would be better as for most of us, this is a first time experience with this restaurant. Next came our experience with finding mold on the bread from your infamous \"all-you-can-eat bread station\". Not quite the dining experience we had hoped for. I would had hopes that some sort of management personnel would have AT LEAST visited us to explain the screw up with our table but having an absence for that event, I would have EXPECTED an IMMEDIATE visit surely after the mold. Unfortunately, our disappointment with Pacini is only beginning. We had insisted to speak with the manager after this. Andy came and explained how he noticed the screw up in the reservation and wondered how they were going to fix that. He explained how he spoken with the \"new\" staff that made such a mistake. I explained how our confirmed came in threes and that I would have presumed that at last one, if not two persons should have seen the mistake. Of course, given that we made our reservation almost a week in advance, one would presume that someone, anyone, should have informed us prior to our arrival. Not even upon our arrival did anyone inform us of the mistake or the dilemma but only an offer of a \"tight squeeze\". I am sure I have never had to \"squeeze in\" even at MacDonalds! The topping to our evening, and I was most certain this HAD to be a feeble attempt at a Candid Camera episode, was that I had the misfortune of ordering the Seafood Linguini. As our party had now been waiting for our dinner way past our patience, I found an unopened mussel in my order. Does the cook know how to cook? Does anyone check the plates before they are sent to the customers? Did the manager have temporary amnesia and forgotten that he had a whole table of already dissatisfied customers? Now I am left wondering if anyone in the whole entire restaurant even trained for their job. After the whole Gong Show we went through, even after speaking with a manager, and as if to add salt to injury, I would have PRESUMED that he or someone, would have at least made an attempt to salvage the rest of our evening. After obviously sending the Seafood Linguini back, I had waited way too long for my remake. The waitress, after about 25 mins, came back to double check that I did not want another order. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! There wasn't even an attempt to make that right???!!!!! After 25 mins??? I was certain they would have rushed that remake! What more can I say. Dinner time was obviously over. Correction, dessert and after dinner drink and conversation time is obviously over but not even an attempt? That's just wrong for any restaurant to have any customers leave hungry! That should be your number one motto if you do not already have that in your training manual and corporate mission. Needless to say, you have made the top of my list of the worst restaurants in the entire planet and most assuredly, the absolute, without peer, worst dining experience I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Pacini on Yelp I decided to try this place out for myself. I went with a group of friends (about 6 of us altogether) and we were placed in a booth which is fine except it's awkward for the servers to reach to pour drinks.  Looking around the ambiance of the place was great. They have a wall that has a damask type floral pattern with lights behind it that change color which I thought was a nice touch.  The roof is nice and high and the staff are friendly there, our server who was fresh and new to the restaurant and didn't know the entire menu off my heart did try his best to do his best to serve us.  At some times he did disappear but I think he had our table and the rest of his tables were out on the patio. Forgiveness for sure. He did try and make sure we got what we wanted.  Pacini has a bread bar which I think is a fantastic idea. They have 5 different types of breads and 5 different kinds of spreads. My favorite by far though was the Tomato Basil bread? I think that's what it was and I paired one piece up with garlic spread and the other with a pesto spread. Damn delicious!! Grilled for a little bit toasted on both sides and perfecto!  I had the Chicken Rosemarino paired up with Parmigiana Fries that they had. I loved my meal, it was the perfect size and tasted fantastic! I especially loved the Fries it was a mixture of potato fries, onions, zucchini, sprinkled with Parmesan and fine herbs served inside a newspaper spread about the Parmigiana Fries!  Definitely would come back to try out some of the other menu items.  I don't think it's fair to say this restaurant is too far -- there's a lot of \"too far\" restaurants. If it's a good place I'll travel all around the city for some good eats."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the bread buffet with grill and multiple butters. Food was a good serving size and tasty with alot of ingredients. They don't cheap out. Price is slightly above moderate but everything about the meal and experience makes it a good value. Half price sangria on Thursdays would be the only way I could see myself ever buying theirs again. No fruit added, alot of ice. A pitcher for $12 is good but for 24? No way!"}
{"text":"Love this place. the pasta here is great. been here around a dozen times with my family (italian) and this is the only restaurant my grandparents will eat at. always have great food. Love the Spaghetti Della Casa. The bread bar is a win. The only disappointment was the tiramisu. I was expecting more of a cake but got a jar of cream. Servers are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Service here was god but Just left with a \"to go\" box as my dinner didn't come until after my entire family received theirs and finished. My husband couldn't eat his gnocchi it was so dry and tough. Usually a cheese pizza is the safe bet (nobody makes inedible for a child), except here. There was so much raw flour on the bottom of the pizza that the kids wouldn't touch it. Bottom line is if you have the opportunity drive right past this restaurant it's not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"I love Pacini. I always have. The bread bar is different from anything I've ever seen and it is delicious. 5 types of bread and 5 different spreads? Sign me up!  Based on our latest visit, I'm really disappointed. While the food was lightening fast and delicious, the service was seriously lacking. Our waitress brought by cheese for our pasta but never stopped by our table again until we were finished eating. At 7:45 pm she was more involved with setting our section up for tomorrow's breakfast than taking care of her only table. I finished my pop about half way through the meal and we emptied our water shortly after. She took away my husband's dishes and then mine, yet I had to ask her to bring more water.   If it was a busy night I would cut them some slack, but as I mentioned above we were our waitresses only table. She should have been significantly more attentive than she was.  Had this been my first visit, I wouldn't come back. However, I know what the restaurant and staff are capable of so we will try it again in a little while.  Edited to add: when we were paying our bill, the waitress told us that next time we visit we should ask to be seated in the front section rather than the back because it would be less awkward. I didn't know me paying you to eat was awkward for you... maybe I won't bother coming back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and love the bread bar with grill to toast your own. Loved the spreads for breads; try the pesto butter or the sun dried tomato butter.  It took 20 minutes to have my order taken at 11am. They weren't that busy, but did have a large table of about 15. Everyone was eating breakfast, I think I was the first to order a lunch.  The pizza was really good. Loved the crust and the sauce was very tasty. The spaghetti was just so so. Not enough meat sauce and sort of bland. I could have done this at home with the same results. In all, the pizza duo (half pizza half pasta) was about $15. Not a very good value, esp. considering that the pasta wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"It was good but not great. Very slow service. One waitress for half the restraunt, and another waitress doing circles around the bread bar. E'rbody excited about the bread bar...its grocery store bread. Would I go back? Maybe, but no rush"}
{"text":"This restaurant was on our must-try-list mainly as it is Italian, in the north end and we had read some great things about it. It surpassed many of our expectations for a chain, fell short in some areas but I think we may come back to try another time. We arrived, had reservations on a Wed night. The hostess was washing the front windows - too bad care was taken to the carpets however. It was the first thing I noted upon entering - the carpets were dirty and in need of vacuuming. The place was much larger than I had envisioned though, neat space with a lounge and even a private little room off the front dining area. I liked the tone of the menu and how it educated one in many parts of it about Pacinis, its values, specials for groups of 8, gluten-free menu, lunch menu. This was problematic though as it was just too thick and long, it was like reading a US Cheesecake Factory menu. The choices were good, varied and pricey. I had wondered how the kitchen could execute every dish well with so much to choose from. A bus boy in view of myself behind some shelving was blowing his nose and then handled the little water glasses onto guest tables without washing his hands. Gross. Then I noted with a passing glance our hostess filling her face with bread in the kitchen. The staff seems young, def. could use some lessons in sanitation. The bread bar was cool. You choose your slice of bread and butter and then throw it onto the grill yourself. Included with your meal price and you can go up as many times as you would like. I had never seen this before. The beer and wine choices we liked. Both white wine and beer could have been chilled more though. It scared the hell out of me when out of nowhere the Birthday Music came on, blaring. Anyone that has been here before will know what I mean! Literally, you have to stop whatever it is you are doing and no one can be heard over that music. It does go away though, eventually, until the next birthday table celebration. We ordered the fettuccine carbonara and while the noodles  were cooked very well and there was lots of meat in it, the Alfredo sauce was glopped on, looked like it had come straight from a jar. Thick and bland. A never-again dish. I later asked the server if she knew if it came from a jar and her response was that she had no idea. I had the Lasagna De La Casa which was ok... the ridged noodles told me immediately it was not made in house, and I could imagine a hundred lasagnas like mine made in mass quantity on an assembly line. Not much love in the dish but the portion size was good and filled the hole for a hot meal. It had veg and sausage on it which was a cool twist. There are 4 lasagnas to choose from and it seemed to be a popular choice. I would try the pizza next time perhaps. I would have tried the veal but each dish was over $30. Our server was just OK. No complaints, nothing memorable either as she did not go out of her way to make our experience the best it could be. We left full enough with leftovers in tow. Not going to rush back but everyone will have their own take on this unique restaurant by the airport, with a patio, attached to a hotel. (Acclaim Hotel) 4 damn blaring birthday songs have scared the crap out of me as I sit here and write this!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Atmosphere: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  My first time here was for a friends birthday dinner and unless you live in the NE or NW (country hills area), Pacini is out of the way and not worth the trip. Upon entering you walk past a little gift shop with an assortment of goodies such as Pacini sauce and pasta mixes, cookies, breads etc.. The restaurant is fairy spacious with tall ceilings, and it had a nice modern decor similar to moxies or milestones.    One of the neatest parts of the restaurant is their all-you-can eat bread station located in the middle of the restaurant where you can choose from over 5 different types of bread and butter spreads (plain, garlic, pesto, and sundried tomato). Once you picked your bread and spread, there is a giant communal grill where you can toast your bread. Definitely a great way to engage the customers.  Once seated, our server offered us a choice between sparkling or regular water which they filter in-house. The menu contains a variety of dishes including your usual Italian appetizers, pizzas, pastas, lasagnas, chicken, and steak.  Our server was professional, nice and attentive. One complaint I had was that the food came out really slow but he was nice enough to let us know of the status.   My bf ordered the Pizzas Rustica Duos (half a pizza and fettuccine alfredo) and I had the Lasagna Oceano (Smoked salmon lasagna rolls topped with a Rosata sauce and garnished with shrimps and scallops, gratinéed with Asiago cheese). The food looked good coming out but no matter how much cheese and sauce they slathered on my pasta, it was still flavorless and was missing that 'je ne sai quoi'.  Overall, Pacini is 'meh'. I've had way better Italian and pasta elsewhere for cheaper. Not worth the trip if you are no where near this place!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Italians meals I've eaten in a long time. The bread bar is a unique touch. The only OK element in this entire restaurant. Service was good but the food was less than average. I say, \"DONT GO!\" $45.00 for a bowl of linguine with stale shrimp and a glass of white wine. The shrimp were very, very small and were stale, smelling ammoniated, were slippery, slimy and the texture was terrible. The sauce on the pasta was very bland and had zero flavor, TASTELESS! Big fat pieces of stewed tomatoes were scattered throughout the dish. YUK! It was like eating the Sunday newspaper soaked in olive oil. Grease was actually floating in pockets throughout the dish. Just because a restaurant is located near the airport they think they can serve awful food at highway robbery prices. Whose watching the store? Note to GM, better start looking. Looks like another silly Italian restaurant franchise about to go under. One more thing... if you advertise a Happy Hour you should tell your guest what it's all about. My hour was far from happy especially after dropping $45.00 for terrible food."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the high prices.. The only thing saving this place from getting 2 stars is their bread grill that they have on the floor of the restaurant.. the way it works is you pick whatever bread and spread you'd like and throw it on the grill to toast...   .. ive never seen that at a restaurant before so they get one point for uniqueness overall its an average italian restaurant at above average prices."}
{"text":"If you live in the North East, Pacini is an option you're going to want to try. My only gripe is the location (just North of the airport), which is simply too far for me to travel especially by transit which is next to nonexistent when you get out that far.  It's been open for about six months, and from my understanding the management has been changed since the opening. The management I dealt with were great and the staff very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Again, I know the new management brought some new staff in when the changed happened, which could show that this new team knows what they are doing.  The food is good, I have to say. I can't describe this as a traditional Italian restaurant, but it's safe to call it a modern Italian restaurant with a few unique twists. They have a complimentary bread bar where people can toast their bread and then slather on one of a few spreads, bottled water is offered to each customer- water that is bottled on-site and comes in either regular or carbonated just to name a couple of features.  The food is good in my opinion. I had the assorted Bruschetta appetizer and a Lasagna with sausages, peppers and other goodies. The appetizer plate was very good (slightly dry) and the lasagna was topnotch.  On the decor side of things, it is a big, modern restaurant that is meant to appeal to a wide variety of clientele. A big bar, high ceilings and a designer wall that changes colour give it a hip-bar feel, while the rest of the restaurant is ideal for dining in groups or in a date setting.  I'm a fan, I just don't know the next time I'll be up that far North."}
{"text":"The bread bar was very cool, the butters were tasty and the grill was definitely a bonus. However, the main dish and dessert were not as good"}
{"text":"we have been to Pacini a few times since it opened two-ish years ago.  Its price point has always worked against it.  It is a little on the high side for what you get.  Their entrees are probably priced $2-5 higher than what they should be, depending on the entree.  Their servicing staff is usually very good, but I find that recently the food has been going downhill.  The steak that we had was properly cooked, but it seems like they let it sit out too long as it was on the cool side.  The shrimp and asparagus were a tad overcooked.  The portions were also on the small side.  The quality of the food was not reflective of the price paid.    One thing that I have noticed this time was that the parking lot was not full like all the other times I have visited.  However, that was partly due to the fact that the restaurant was no where near full on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve a 3 star, so I am going to balance the rating. Grill your own garlic bread! Wow! If you like bread, there are 5 types of bread, plus 4 types flavored butter, pesto, sundried tomatoes, garlic etc. We got the chicken salad, chicken had a nice smoky but bland flavor. The pasta primavera was delicious, with tomato sauce and vegetables. Overall the place is a 4, service was impeccable and food well presented and cooked."}
{"text":"Clean and modern decor.  Near airport but located in a purely commercial/warehouse district.  Excellent food but a bit overpriced. Typ entrees are $18-25."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here but I a disappointment. The customer service was awful! It's wasn't that busy and the lounge had tons of empty tables but my friend who got there before me was told he couldn't sit in the lounge and instead they had him sit at this awkwardly placed table near the bathrooms and coat hangers - although there were plenty of other empty tables. We asked to be moved and were met with some rude waitresses, who reluctantly gave us a decent table. From there it was a continuous effort to get a glass of water, order a drink or even get cutlery to eat our food. Ridiculous - management needs to evaluate the type of service these employees are providing. I'll not go back."}
{"text":"Went and checked this place out tonight with a few friends. It's very \"Calgary\" inside the place, with the servers in little black skirts, being as sweet as possible and a sleek, modern interior.  The bread bar was neat, I enjoyed the various butters and the freshness of the bread. I had the Antipasto app, which was pretty tasty. I tried the veal as my main and it was pretty good, but they were out of gnocci for my side which seemed odd to me. I had to get the pasta instead, which was pretty \"tinny\" to taste. Could have been straight out of a can. I also tried the lasagna, which was almost dry to taste.  The comfort and service were definitely a saving grace to an overly average meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, got sat quickly, within minutes got our drinks... reading the other yelp reviews sounds like service is a problem, we had no problems at all.  It just must not be consistent.   Our food was great, but yes, a little pricey.   Would have gave it 5 stars if the portion sizes were a little bit bigger for the price.  Loved the self-serve bread bar...even if it is a little 'gimicky'"}
{"text":"First time in, visiting from North Carolina. Group of 10, service and meals were excellent. I ordered seafood linguine- WOW. Dish was absolutely phenomenal. I'll certainly be back the next visit to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Only had 45 minutes before flight and they made it work. Had an awesome chicken parm sandwich."}
{"text":"Love love love the bread bar! Who doesn't want unlimited amounts of bread? I love pacini's. I don't know what else to say. I'm a big pasta person! Now back to the bread bar. They have an assortment of breads and spreads. When you are done, there is a grill that you can place it on. The people there are super friendly, the food is awesome, and the environment is perfect for a date or a special occasion! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised by the low ratings! Pacini's is a great Italian restaurant. Perhaps I haven't been to many great restaurants to compare it to, but I love their atmosphere. The biggest problem is the location--I don't recommend busing there as getting back is a pain in the butt!  However, their bread bar is pretty good, but fills you up too much. Although having leftovers at Pacini's is never a bad thing. The times that I've went there have been good experiences, except for the most recent one where the waiter was forgetful and didn't give us complimentary chocolate-covered cherries.  It was my birthday a few days ago and their original spin on it astounded me. They change the music over the system and all the staff sing an original tune to you, while bringing a dessert (I had maple cheesecake, and my cousin had a cream puff a while back) with a sparkler on top. And to top it off, they scribbled \"Happy Birthday\" on the plate in a scrumptious raspberry sauce.  I don't know, I'm a bit biased towards Italian cuisine because it's so delicious! Pacini's is very reasonably priced compared to other restaurants. Everything is generally under $20 with exception of the steak, and although their appetizers are a little pricey (they usually are), their bruschetta is yummy! Their creams are rich and feel healthy (much like their spreads at the bread bar) and it feels home-styled.  Their veal burger was totally new to me, and it was pretty decent. Not the best thing on their menu, but you can never luck out on any dish. I also love how they offer carbonated water! Where can you get that for free? If you've never tried it, you might as well come to Pacini's at least once in your life. It's a pleasant atmosphere, the food is delicious and reasonably priced, and the staff there is pretty nice.  Oh yeah, and you should try their fries. They're quite delectable."}
{"text":"Pretty decent restaurant. I had to view it was slightly overcooked but it was still not so bad. Good wine selection, bread bar is great, a little pricey. It is a good safe place to eat."}
{"text":"Our family decided to eat here prior to our flight out of Canada and we were not disappointed! The food was great & the customer service was outstanding. Because we were a large group, we often were treated with frustration during our other restaurant experiences however our servers were very nice and accommodating towards our large family."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and had already returned our rental car due to an early morning flight the following day. Pacini was a convenient dinner choice.   This was our first time dining at Pacini and will be our last. We had a pizza and spaghetti. Neither entrée was very good. Quite tasteless and overpriced. However, the garlic bread bar was nice. Our waitress lacked personality and was not at all helpful when we asked questions. It was very strange that she brought the card reader to the table and stood there while we determined her tip and completed the transaction. She did not thank us and seemed annoyed and distracted."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant a couple months ago.  Took our 2 kids (4 & 6) with us.  Hubs had visited during lunch one day last year and was impressed so he wanted to bring us all back to try it.  As many have said the bread bar is quite impressive and a unique feature for a restaurant.  I personally loved it being the bread lover that I am.  Hubs and I shared the Bruschetta Duo to start.  Since he doesn't enjoy olives I ate most of the olive bruschetta.  Both the traditional & olive bruschetta were equally delightful.  Between this appy and the bread bar I was already on my way to being full.  For dinner I opted for the Fettuccine Carbonara knowing hubs might finish what I couldn't.  It was decent.  Hubs ordered the Chicken Parmigiana and advised while it wasn't as good as mine (brownie points) it was palatable and he cleaned the plate.  The kids had small dishes of spaghetti....no complaints there either. The restaurant was kid friendly which helps when you have smallish kids (4/6).  While the menu items did seem a little pricey, I have no complaints with the restaurant and will return in the future."}
{"text":"5 minutes from the airport, great spot to catch a quick bite before your flight. If you tell them you have a flight to catch, they do their best to get your food out quick. They've done this for me a few times and it's very much appreciated! Service is always spectacular here, they go out of their way to make sure you are having a good meal. Grill your own toast is such a great idea too. Idea being the key word. Usually there are a handful of kids going through their pyro phase here, parents MIA. It never works out for me, but the spreads they have are delish!  Only quiffs I have with this place is...the food. It's always really just sub par. Run of the mill, Boston Pizza food. I think someone mentioned this in a previous review and I couldn't agree more. Pasta + Sauce. Pretty meh.   I would come for some wine and drinks though, as the atmosphere is pretty sleek and the raised bar area gives way to some privacy."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 Overall experience: 4.5/5  Overall I really enjoy the atmosphere & service. I find the prices are moderate considering the bread bar & bottled water is inclusive. These are unique/nice touches. I would rank it among my favorite restaurants.  -- Alex"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 Grey Goose shots, and they were half water, I kid you not. Complained, and the manager basically said we were lying. She told the waitress to give us one free shot, and had her go to our table with the bottle, and pour it in front of us. (Not sure what the point of this was - to be cocky? Neither the waitress nor us were happy with that) This shot was normal.  Thanks Pacini's - for charging us overpriced shots, watering them down by half, then insulting us when we complain! What did you end up saving? $10 in Vodka?"}
{"text":"My husband I went here for our anniversary dinner.   Not much to look at from the outside but once you walk through the doors it's very upscale and inviting.  We where seated promptly and our server was very attentive and fantastic.  He sold us right away on a bottle of wine that was on special.  He also helped up with our menu choices. I have to say my all time favorite was the bread bar.  I honestly could have just eaten the bread bar for my meal.  I love the focaccia bread dipped in oil and balsamic.  They have a huge grill that you can grill your choice of bread on and a nice selection of butters.  Now I noticed most people buttering their bread then grilling it...no no no...you loose all the flavor of the butter that way.  You grill your bread first then put on the butter.   I had the carbonara as my entree and it was good.  I'd not suggest getting cheese baked on the top...for me it ruined the texture of the pasta and dried it out I found.  Next time we go I think we're going to check out their pizza and those fries!!!!   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a different Italian experience."}
{"text":"Great dining spot for a traveller. I am on business at a near by Homewood Suites and this spot had great food and pleasant vibe to it."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once because no one wants to drive that far NE to meet me!  There's no doubt that it's inconveniently located for many folks and the north Barlow Trail closure doesn't help.    I like the decor but the service wasn't great.  What I tried (being samples of other people's dishes) was average, which I don't consider to be a bad thing.  It just wasn't noteworthy.  The desert presentation is fun, but mine was served in a jar and I didn't like the mild challenge of getting to some of it.  Regardless, I do want to go back one more time."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!! The food was great (and I'm pretty picky about my Italian food because I lived in Italy for a bit). I ordered the Italian crusted cod and it was really good! The pasta was perfectly al dente. Great eating experience even though we had a large party (15) and the bread bar was a plus!!!!!"}
{"text":"A favourite to many is this restaurant's Bread Bar. Undeniably delicious. The bread bar is actually a self-serving area - complimentary when you order an entrée. A variety style of bread and flavoured butter is provided near the grilling station  - once you have picked your choice of bread and had them buttered - the breads are then placed on the grill to have that crispy toasty effect. It's so good that you'll feel guilty after the 5th round of Bread Bar.    I love my Fettucini Alfredo pasta with Chicken Breast from Ricky's All Day Grill - I figured since this is an Italian Restaurant - pasta should fare way better than a non-Italian restaurant. I literally had my pasta made for me 3 times and I gave up. The pasta was chewy even though I told them umpteen times I like it really really soft. Each time it turned out chewy - I emphasised strongly on having it real soft. Still they failed to serve me real soft pasta - all 3 times. The lack of gravy made the pasta lacked of moisture which made it difficult to savour - flavour was also lacking.   Even though I hardly ate my entrée - they still charged me for the item - nevertheless I was offered a free dessert. A good dessert but I'm definitely not a fan. The only thing that really stands out is its Bread Bar and pizzas.  Quite disappointing actually. I left quite unsatisfied and wouldn't consider returning again - unfortunately."}
{"text":"Loved it  On our was home from an amazing trip through the Canada West, we spent the night at a hotel close to the Airport and in doing so limited our options for dinner. Pacini Pasta was our only choice actually. We read some mixed reviews on yelp and I have to honestly say I can't figure out what the negative reviews were talking about.  First off, the staff was very friendly. From the hostes to the servers, everyone met us and served us with genuine smiles.  The restaurant was clean and beautifully decorated. It is a great place for a date or a family dinner. They have large tables and even private rooms for those who desire them.  The bar was a bit quite while we were there but looks like a great place for a few drinks and has great TVs for catching a game.  The food selection is great. There is something for everyone. The food itself wasn't the bets I've ever had, but it was good. Everyone was pleased with their mean.  The bread bar is a lot of fun. I have never seen anything like this before. The different butters and spreads they have are very tasty (garlic, pesto, tomato basil, etc) and grilling your own bread is simple yet somehow really fun! Especially for the young ones.  Our server (from Romania) was excellent. She was friendly, fast and took really great care of us.  I would definitely recommend Pacini Pasta and Grill to anyone looking for a date spot, family dinner location or just somewhere to grab a meal and watch a game on TV."}
{"text":"Not horrible.  They have a grilled bread station which I have never seen before, you add pesto, butter or garlic butter to your bread and you grill it out in the open, very social.  The service was good.  I had the bruschetta and was different, the pesto was a tad oily. I had the encrusted halibut and  pasta, the halibut was cooked to perfection, I was very surprised, it was yummy and the pasta was ok, quite oily but still good.   It's a pass"}
{"text":"Seeing that I gave this place two stars, it was highly unlikely that I would come back but being invited to a friends party warranted me shutting the heck up and going anyway!  Well I have to say that they moved up one star!  The food is still just ok, nothing close to what I would score for high end Italian.  I tired the linguine with shrimps and I have to say the shrimps are what bumped them up!  There were at least 10 good sized large shrimp, not the little cocktail ones they serve with their other shrimp dish (brochettes).  They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was nice and light.  They were under construction in the front part of the house, obvious black tarps covered it, so it did seem a bit odd but wasn't as a deal breaker.  Lost points for the price of mocktails which with no booze cost about the same as with booze! And attitude from the hostess who would not seat us till 75% of the party arrived; they all followed within 5 minutes so I didn't see what the big deal was.  Almost all places I've been to seat us no matter how many are there.  So I was not happy about that, especially with the chilly wind creeping when when other parties came through.  Perhaps the construction is for seating all those people who don't come with all their party!  Service was prompt, waitress was sweet and the bread bar was a hit with most of the ladies we were with.  I would probably come back if invited, but still find the food just OK and the price points are not reasonable for the quality compared to the higher end Italian restaurants that serve up the same fare."}
{"text":"A beautiful, beautiful restaurant.  Servings on some things like pizza are too small to share, but they have a nice kid's menu, a great bar, and a confusing menu that tries to be  just a little more than it needs to be. The sangria is nothing like a sangria in spain or anywhere else.  The fried vegetables were just strange.  Service was a little off the first night we were there, with long waits, but was much better the second night we went downstairs.   The bread bar is nice, although no one told us about it the first night we were there.  In this low carb world, it's strange to have an all you can eat, \"toast your own\", bread and butter bar.  It was okay.  For a run of the mill traveler's hotel building, the interior of this restaurant is really beautiful.  Can't say enough about it.  Wish they had room service, since they are so closely integrated with the hotel, but they do allow you to call and you can pick up meals and take them to your room."}
{"text":"Went here with some co-workers for dinner on a weekend.   The service was great, and we loved the idea of the bread bar!   You choose your bread type, your butter, and then grill it.   The Italian food was very bland and generic, but the bread bar made the evening spectacular."}
