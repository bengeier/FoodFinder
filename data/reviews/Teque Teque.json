{"text":"I'm Venezuelan and therefore I'm very serious about tequeños. It's a delicate issue for us, very personal. And these guys have achieved the difficult goal of finding a way of reproducing it so far from Venezuela. They have also a nice place in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Montreal. A very good spot to get familiar with tequeños, the traditional ones as well some interesting variations."}
{"text":"Charming shop in little Italy. 

The service is really nice and the seating is comfortable.
I tried to sugar cane lemonade - it's refreshing and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. 

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Les tequeños et les empanadas sont délicieux! Le service est excellent ! 100% recommandé !"}
{"text":"Delicious, sugarcane sweetened lemonade that's served in a biodegradable plastic cup (so you'll feel less guilty than if you picked one up at Starbucks). Great eats as well! Pick some up and head to the park."}
{"text":"I come here to work now and then as there is always a table, they have free wi-fi and it's dog-friendly so that my little beast can come along too . The staff here is kind, always smiling and warning you that the empanada that you are about to cram into your mouth is SUPER HOT!!! Personally, I love the smoothies here: simple, fresh and never too sweet. Vegetarian options, something for everyone and they have a phone charging station, awesome!"}
{"text":"Nice place , good food but i think the price is little hight for the \"mini\" portion to eat .."}
