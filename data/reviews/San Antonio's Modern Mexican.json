{"text":"$1 margaritas + $5 lunch specials make this a great place for lunch!

Went for dinner, food was still very good but not as absurdly well priced (but still very reasonable!)"}
{"text":"We've made two visits here, both obviously sparked by the $5 \"Keep this place open\" bonanza.  

The first visit we went there around 5:30p on a weekday.  The place was crowded but there were open tables because I guess they were low on servers.  We waited maybe 20 minutes and were seated, not too bad.  Server comes up, looking less than pleased and says \"Hey Guys, I'm not feeling too good so that's why I don't look so enthusiastic\".  Okay? 

We both ordered the fajitas. One combo with steak and shrimp, the other with chicken and shrimp.  If I'm grading based on value, it gets 5 stars.  For $5 it's definitely a better value than McDonalds.  If I'm grading based on the price that the menu showed, around $15, well that's not even close.  The steak was pretty good, chicken was plain, and shrimp was less than plain as well as small.  It was served on a plate of onions, not enough peppers.  We also got a BBQ burrito to go, for $5 why not? It was pretty good.  The BBQ sauce tasted like it was bottled, the same fajita chicken was on the inside of the burrito so it was rather plain other than the sauce, but size wise it was huge.  

Second visit we called ahead knowing it would be pretty busy, we called an hour ahead for a party of 5.  We got there and were told that it would be 50 minutes until seated. I don't claim to know their systems or rationale, but if it's going to be 60 minutes plus 50 minutes, just let me know before I drive up there please.  We then asked a waitress if the tables at the bar were first come first serve and she said yes.  We sat down, and then were told by a manager that we can't sit there.  Pointed to the girl who said it and he said we couldn't sit there.  Okay? 

Overall, for $5 the food is great.  But unfortunately that will be over in a matter of days.  This place has to live on it's printed prices which are 2-3 times the prices now.  The restaurant is dark and they cut many corners when remodeling it after Morton's left.  Is it worth the money? No.  Go to Monterrey, Azteca or a more traditional mexican restaurant and save your money, you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"The service is terrible... it took forever for us to be waited on and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all.

It was worth it though because the food was delicious. I got blackened tilapia tacos and a sangria.

Drink specials ALL DAY EVERY DAY: $1 margaritas, $2 sangria, $3 Corona/Corona Light"}
{"text":"Guacamole was amazing, but I don't eat pork and unfortunately all the beans cooked at San Antonio's are cooked with pork."}
{"text":"Two dollar margaritas (red or white), one dollar sangria's and three dollar Coronas daily.  Couple that with a great location near my hotel, good food and fair prices and I'm a happy dude (though I'm still pissed about that $50 breakfast at \"that other\" establishment)."}
{"text":"This place is very wallet friendly-$1 Margaritas, $2 Sangria, $3 Beers and the food prices aren't bad at all. They had an extensive menu and I opted for the pollo nachos which were great and the sangria was good for $2. I wasn't impressed with the margarita (even after I got the extra shot for $1), like some others said it was completely sugar ridden and not good. The salsa was bland and I've had better such as the generic brand at the supermarket.

Service wise, I am agreeing with it others it was pretty bad. Our server didn't have knowledge of the menu or how to spell mojito (I served for six yrs so I am very understanding when it comes to service but you should know whats on the menu) and she kept stopping by to see if we needed our check when we were ordering rounds of drinks and going to be there for awhile. It was a little too loud for me also and really difficult to carry on a conversation so this place would probably be good for those with kids who tend to get a little loud.

All in all, if you're looking for mediocre food, cheap drinks and a loud atmosphere this is the place for you."}
{"text":"How can you beat $2 sangria?  And it's good too!  I like the chicken or shredded beef tacos although the beef is a little greasy.  The table-side guacamole is overkill at $10 but great for a group to share.

The chips are made in house and always warm when they hit the table.  I've never had any problems with customer service but I have to admit I usually wait a month or two before trying a brand new place to give them time to work out the kinks.

But the real winner is the ambience.  The interior is comfortably between swanky and casual.  Family and first dates alike can enjoy great times."}
{"text":"A 5$ menu on the fifth of every month! I visited this place on 8/5 & it was packed! They had live music & if it werent raining, the patio wouldve been rocking too. 
 We had to wait a little longer than the hostess quoted us but, thats to be expected with the amount of people waiting. 
I ordered the South Texas Ribs, normally a 24$ dish. They were fall off the bone tender & the sauce was incredible. 
The service was better than we anticipated with such a crowd. The manager also had time to stop by the table & check on us a couple times.
I will be back this week for lunch & next month for the ribs!"}
{"text":"We stopped by after hitting up the Apple Store for the $5 special in May. It was a mad house with lots of folks trying to get in on the deal. Was it worth the wait to pay $5 an entree? Probably not. Would I ever go back? Probably not.  It was similar to an On the Border - not really authentic Mexican and for goodness sake it was attached to the mall.

The wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed with the restaurant packed with bargain hunters and it showed with the service we received. After taking our order the waiter disappeared only to return 40 min later with our entree's. One of the floor managers actually brought us refills on drinks and chips. I was willing to overlook that because of the crazy special they were running but I draw the line at what was served.

 My husband ordered the flank steak and  when it came out it was embarrassingly tiny and burnt.  I laughed and took a picture of it; I've had hotdogs bigger than that. The shrimp & steak fajitas came out on a cast iron plate but were luke warm like they were sitting in the window for quite some time. Seriously, if Chili's & Applebee's can master a hot cast iron steaming plate of fajitas and your restaurant can't there is something really wrong with the operation. The waiter dumped the entree's and ran - I'm pretty sure he knew what we were thinking when he set everything down. My thoughts were \"You get what you pay for\" and I was having buyer's remorse before the first bite. 

The floor manager stopped by and asked if everything was all right about 20 minutes later when we were scanning the room for the waiter to get the check. I asked her if the flank steak was normally that size and overdone. She said no and wanted to cook us another one. By that point we had been at the restaurant close to 3 hours and wanted to get out of there but she insisted on trying to make it right. We relented but it was far from impressive; Although the steak was a decent size it was undercooked. Better than being burnt like the first but far from the requested Medium Rare. (See my pics in the album for the before and after shots) 

The whole night wasn't a failure since we did get to visit the Apple Store but I don't think I will ever return to San Antonio's. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if we went a different time (when there is no $5 special) but next time I want to eat after shopping, I'll stick to the food court."}
{"text":"This place is really trying to be upscale and it just doesn't deliver.  I've been here twice and it's failed to impress me.  Good value and the guacamole made table side is cool, but it's been done and they don't do it any different here...  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and I thought the quality of the chicken looked a little suspect.  This recent visit was met with sub-par service.  Just nothing wows you at this place, unfortunate."}
{"text":"I am a fan because of the Bufflo Fried Oyster appetizers.  My Fiance and I were beyond happy with them.  The texture was perfect and the fresh blue cheese that was sprinkled over it made it delicious.

Of course the margaritas are a bargain, specially with the extra shot for $1 dollar.  

My fiance had the steak and shrimp fajitas, he thought they were so so, I liked eating up .all his extra onions!

I had the shrimp tacos, which I thought was well executed.   The spices and tenderness were spot on."}
{"text":"Vida should have opened another location in this spot.  Service was slow but wait staff was pleasant & comped us a drink for understanding.  The fish tacos were tasty.  Was in a group of 15.  Most of the food went 3/4 untouched & not because the portions were huge."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas and spent some time in San Antonio, I think San Antonio's Modern Mexican represents the famous Riverwalk well: good drink specials and average food in a dimly lit environment. 

It's a good sized place with lots of seating. However, once the place is filled, it is difficult to hear your party since it gets quite loud. 

We ordered the chicken fajitas. What convinced us to stray from our veggie habit was the description of being marinated for 24 hours. For something that has been marinating that long, you would expect it to pack a flavor punch. The fajitas were nothing special, nor had any exceptional flavor. The salsa seemed bland. The chips and tortillas were good. Again, wanting to represent Riverwalk food, they got it right. 

The service was good and friendly. The main draw is their drink specials...$1 margaritas every day and at any time!"}
{"text":"Please do not go here! My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Sunday evening. Figuring there would probably be a wait, we had already planned to go to the bar for their VIP margaritas while we had to wait for our table (this was going to be our 2nd time visiting the restaurant). We checked in with the host who said the wait would be about 20 minutes, which we expected. We made our way to the bar to order our drinks and wait. Unfortunately, there were only two bartenders behind the bar on a pretty busy night. One of the bartenders was doing his best not to make eye contact with anyone and walked around behind the bar, constantly checking the machine where the servers drink orders come up (in the 20 minutes we waited at the bar only one ticket came through), while the other bartender leisurely took people's drink orders, but mostly watched the golf that was playing on the TV at the bar. We waited for 10 minutes before even being acknowledged by a bartender, and when we finally made eye contact with him he put his finger up and mouthed \"one minute\"....That minute passed, and he never came back. FINALLY we saw the manager come behind the bar and we were excited we were finally going to get our drinks, only to find him and the bartender who 10 minutes ago told us \"one minute\" stand behind the bar, and watch the golf together. My boyfriend and I looked at each other, baffled, and wondered why they did not want our business (we were going to be ordering $12 drinks each). We decided to give it another minute. When the bartender finally cameo our way, and progresses to a few people that had recently walked up to the bar, and were ordering sodas, we decided that it was not worth all of this time to be ignored. We took our pager back up to the host stand, said that we had been waiting over 15 minutes for drinks and had not even been greeted by a bartender, or the manager, the host said \"sorry about that\" and took our pager. In my experience in the restaurant industry, you never let a customer leave unhappy. Feeling totally insulted we decided to leave, we walked to Paco's Tacos and Tequila on the other side of the mall and had one of the best Mexican meals ever. We will NEVER go to San Antonio's again and we tell EVERYONE how AWFUL this place is. Do not waste your money on this restaurant! You are better off going to Paco's Tacos and Tequila! I wish I could give them zero stars, that is how awful this restaurant is."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for drinks and an early dinner.  It was not the typical Mexican décor, a little more sophisticated with dark wood paneling and low lighting in the bar area.  Service was standard.  The best part was the guacamole made table side, we ordered it TWICE it was that good!  I typically don't prefer \"chain\" type restaurants...so...my opinion is: \"Glad I went, but been there, done that, no need to go back\"

I would like to rank the restaurant with 2 stars for being just another \"me too\" but I will give it 3 stars just for the guacamole - BTW - we had him make it extra spicy!"}
{"text":"San Antonio's is just So-So Bland...

I had some high expectations with my first foray into Tex Mex. San Antonio's has a many things working in its favor: cheap drinks, wonderful staff and nice vibe inside. 

Somehow the food just missed the mark. The chips were cold and salsa was bland with no kick. The inexpensive margaritas were too sweet/sour and was lacking in the booze category.  I ordered the Seafood taco's which looked great had no flavor what so ever.

I am not sure if it was an off night but SA sure fell below expectations."}
{"text":"$1 Margaritas do not guarantee a good restaurant experience, and this one was not. Now, granted, they have only been open a week. Still, I expect more from the group that has run Manzetti's, Burro Loco, and others for years. Here is what I hope will improve: Service- There isn't much good to say. It was slow, glasses were empty. When I asked the server what he would recommend on the menu, he pointed to a chop and gave this ringing endorsement \"you wont find anything like that other places\". Yum, that does sound good! Food- It is hard to mess up fajitas, but the did. We got a plate of under cooked onions and peppers, topped with some lukewarm chicken. Now, I gave them another chance. When the waiter made his requisite \"how was everything\" check in stop, we said not good. He said. \"really, huh\" and walked off. I waited ten minutes for a manager to come over and get my feedback, but no one ever showed. One other note, this place is very noisy. Not, in a cool, happening, this-is-the-place-to-be noisy way. More like it is really loud in here, and in a hard- to- hear- you kinda way. Obviously, I hope things get better. In the meantime, I'll stick to the $1 margaritas at the bar before I head to someplace good for dinner"}
{"text":"I wanted to add this place to the Yelp community because of how new it is.  I think they've only been around for a few months.  They have a great spot... right in SouthPark Mall, next to Dick's Sporting Goods. They have a pretty good menu selection.  I went with some friends after work the other night and didn't eat anything, but my buddies got some dip and some appetizers and it all looked pretty nice. Authentic mexican bean dip and homemade tortilla chips. Not bad. The only complaint I would have about my visit would be the service.  Our original bartender was pretty cool.  Very attentive and thorough. But after the \"Changing of the Guard\" the new guy might as well have been a bump on a damn log.  They guy was way too interested in flirting with some chick at the end of the bar then make sure his party of 7 got taken care of.  Took him 20 minutes to cash me out with an empty bar. 
Other than that it was a nice time. They have a great atmosphere, soccer up on the big screens and Pacifico a-plenty. Nice place to stop by after a long day working retail.  So I'd say give it a try.  Don't sit at the bar, maybe.  You might get the pretty boy who's oblivious to the world."}
{"text":"Don't let the $2 sangrias fool you.  Mediocre food and HORRIBLE service.  We sat at the bar most recently this past week and let me just say the bartenders were much more interested in chatting with each other than getting the free chips and salsa (had to ask even AFTER we ordered), had to BEG for more alocohol - what is the problem are we interupting your social hours guys???!  BLAH - I got fish tacos and they were fine - really I could have saved a lot of money heading to Taco Bell and get a six pack of Heiny instead of putting up with the aggravation of trying to eat here!"}
{"text":"Only been there one time. We had a horrible experience. Were told when walked there was a 10 min wait. Ended up being 30.
Service was the worst I've ever seen. Sat at our table for another 10 minutes before our server came over. Drinks then proceeded to takes another 10 min to arrive. Had to ask for utensils. Food was below average. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Best pricing for Happy Hour!
$1 Margaritas (and only $1 for an extra shot!)
$2 Sangria (red or white)
$3 Beers

Fast and friendly wait staff, sit at the bar!!! Free chips and salsa with any order (that counts drinks!)

Great place to go if you love tequila or sangria to wind down after work!"}
{"text":"I am a very fair person and don't like railing on a restaurant unless its absolutely deserving.  That being said I will preface my review by saying that my experience is only relative to bar service and eating dinner at the bar.  Which by the way, shame on me, I should have learned by now that bartenders are NOT waiters and I should never sit at the bar for dinner.  So I think you know where I am going with this review.  Yes, the food was fine, not great, fine.  The service, beyond repair, horrible, non existent and pathetic.  My golden rule is that if I'm at your establishment, please don't make me feel like staff by having to work at and do what you should already be doing.  #1, if I see everyone has chips as a starter (much like most Mexican eateries) then I expect you to bring me some, not for me to have to ask you about it a solid ten minutes after ordering.  #2, If I'm with two beautiful girls and their drinks run dry and you offer then a refill within seconds of them placing their drink down yet I've been done with my lonesome beer for fifteen minutes I don't want to feel like I have to grow out my hair and grow breasts in order for you to serve me.  On top of that, I won't go into any particular details but I happen to leave a personal belonging at this place and turned around to get it within a minute or less of walking out the door only to find it gone and no one know about it.  After giving the staff the feeling that I wasn't leaving until I found it, this said item magically appears from behind the bar with the explination \"it was covered up with the napkin\".  So you picked up a napkin that weighed more than what 20 cloth napkins combined would have and didn't think to give it to the front desk so if the person came back they would have it?  S-H-A-D-Y.  

San Antonio's Modern Mexican should be called simply the Alamo because with service like this no one will be able to forget you....trust me."}
{"text":"Well, many in America complain about the Super-sizing of meals. They've solved that here. My lunch, Pollo Fundido will save calories. It was about 8 bites. A buck a bite. Taste was ok. Salsa was bland. 

Service was good: attentive, prompt, friendly. 

It is loud. Don't plan on making business calls. 

I don't typically drink during the day so can't speak to the margaritas. The water was good :)"}
{"text":"The best part of San Antonio's is the $1 margarita, but as other reviewers have said, make it a $2 margarita and get the extra shot.  

That, unfortunately, was the best part of the experience.  Not trying to be a hater, but....

I went there with my girlfriend at 8PM on a Thursday.  We were told it would be a 10 minute wait - turned out to be 20.  Not a big deal.  There is not a ton of room at the bar to get drinks while you wait (too many tables in the bar), so we opted to wait outside.  Again, not a big deal.  

We were seated and the waiter showed up in just a couple of minutes.  My girlfriend got one of their premium margaritas.  I got the $2 margarita.  Both were good.  

The guacamole is made table side, but was just OK.  I've had more flavorful guac at many other places.  Probably my biggest complaint was no salt and too much lime juice.  But, in general, it was fine.   The chips they serve are just not good.  They are slightly thicker than others and were either too cool or stale, so they crunched funny.  Just not flavorful.  

Now, the entrees.  In my opinion, really not that good.  I had the beef rib burrito with rice and refried beans.  The beef rib filling was way too greasy inside the burrito.  Every bite I took was just full of oil.  Not good at all.  The rice was bland, but I feel most rice dishes at Mexican restaurants are.  The beans were OK, but nothing great.  

My girlfriend had the combo fajitas - chicken and fresh vegetables.  It looked more like stir-fry than fajitas.  I had a few bites and while they were tasty, the plate still looked like a mess and I have enjoyed better fajitas at Chili's.  

All and all, I was not impressed.  I'll go back, but only for appetizers and margaritas at the bar."}
{"text":"I won't comment on the specials, but I will say that this place COMPLETELY shocked and surprised me in the best of ways.

We had a large party of 10 but called ahead and a hour later we arrived and were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter was  very nice, attentive and patient (we were a little rowdy!).

Fast forward to dinner and I got the shrimp tacos - WOWWWW! Delicioso mucho! Between the ample serving portion, the ranchero beans and the endless  chips and well spiced salsa, I have already made a few plans to take my family, and meet friends here again in the future - even if the $5 menu item deal ends!"}
{"text":"Can't say I was impressed. Margarita wasn't very good. Had to ask for everything including utensils."}
{"text":"Great attention, excellent food and great prices.... The best margaritas in town.... Ask for jalapeno shrimps.... Just perfect!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the home of the dollar margarita and its the best I have experienced however get the extra shot in it makes it even better.  The white sangria a little sweet which I love, which is 2.00 a glass.  I have not eaten at San Antonio other than desert of which was very good the Churro's are so good strawberry filled with ice cream enough for two unless you dont share your deserts.  I will say its a hit or miss with the bartenders, we either get a great one or one with no personality.  But for 1 margarita and 2 sangria you cant beat it."}
{"text":"This place has $1 margaritas. If you want one that doesn't taste like dimetapp, ask for an extra shot and make it a $2 margaritas.

For Southpark, it's one of the most affordable places for lunch.  The food isn't anything to rave over.  They have $1 margaritas. I had some cheesy chicken burrito thing that wasn't bad but it left me feeling more full than content. My friend had the fish tacos and wasn't wowed either.  

So the food is mediocre but the prices for lunch really aren't bad.  We escaped for around $10 a person before the $1 margaritas started piling up.  

If you're looking for an alternative to the fast food places at the mall and the executive restaurants in Southpark, I'd give them a shot.

Did I mention they have $1 margaritas but my recommendation - get the extra shot."}
{"text":"okay quick review of this one. 

we went on a conquest for a mojito and typically cheescake factory makes them alright (back home anyway) so we went to the cheescake faaaaHOLY BUSY ON A SATURDAY NIGHTfuckthis....  

so we rounded the mall and ran into San Antonios.  it was also busy but they had spots near the bar open.  we ordered a couple \"the original mojito\"  and dove into the chips n salsa.

chips were thick and tasted good.  could have been a little warmer, but i wouldnt say they were bad.  salsa was okay.  we ordered the queso and that was superior.  we also ordered some chicken nachos to share.

the nachos were awesome.  it was plenty for 2 people as a quick appetizer and drink, but i could see ordering this as my main dish and being a very happy aphex.  jalapenos, big chunks of chicken, beef and generous dollop of sour cream among the rest of the goodness.  i was impressed.  ive been to a restaurant called \"nacho\" that didnt make them this well. 

as for the mojitos, they were top notch.  fresh mint, just sweet enough and not overdone with the alcohol.  i wanted another.  you will want another.  but we were on an agenda and were out the door.

great experience.  staff was friendly and attentive, even when the place was slammed.  the menu looked like it had some good stuff on there and i saw waiters making some salsa fresh at the table.  i also saw what i think was a humunnnngus taco salad.  aphex likes him some taco salad.  that looked like a taco salad i want to get to know. ifyouknowwhatimean"}
{"text":"$2 Sangria... Hola!  If you know how much of a sucker I am for this refreshing, spirited thirst quencher, then you can understand my excitement this past Saturday at approximately 5pm.  I have heard about the margarita special, but didn't know about the sangria.  Both the white & red were yummy; perfect for a mid-day break after a day of shopping (or in my case, working).  Service at the bar was decent.  Granted I now realize we didn't get any chips & salsa... hmmm.  My friend and I shared an order of the fish taco; the tilapia was plentiful (half a filet for each taco), plus rice & ranchero beans made this a good size meal for about $8, which is cheaper than some of the appetizers.  I do have to say it took quite some time to get our food, and it's during odd time on a weekend when there's no many patrons, I hope they're faster during rush hours.  

In short, I think this is a solid place for the price and location.  Considering my office will be moving closer to the mall area in May, can we say \"dangerous?!\""}
{"text":"The place has slipped backwards since my last two visits. The service is good but the food is not where it needs to be. Great location and I believe they have potential.

They need to take it up a notch. The patio seating is fun and the happy hour prices are attractive."}
{"text":"Shrimp salad was not good. Cold shrimp and no flavor. Not worth $12 for this salad."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! If I come in at 11:05 o should still b able to get food. I'm the customer...i went back on sunday and  i was served well so 4 stars because i ate but they need to let ppl know they dont serve food after 10:59pm when they close at 12...

THE REST OF THIS MONTH THE ENTIRE MEUN IS $5 THATS RIGHT ALL MEANS ARE $5!!"}
{"text":"A good friend mentioned that San Antonio's had $1 margaritas on Thursday nights... we just had to find out if it was as good as it sounded.  

I was running a bit late, but everyone had been seated at a table in the corner.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all and the server greeted me pretty quickly once I sat down.

After munching on some chips and salsa, it was a little difficult to flag our waitress down since we were still waiting on a couple more people to join us.  I think she thought we were going to wait to order once everyone got there.

I got the margarita with the extra shot, but it was accidentally given to one of my other friends.... no biggie, but the waitress looked a little confused with which margarita was which.  This didn't exactly give us confidence that she would get our food orders correct either.

For dinner, I had the red chili pepper salmon salad with habanero mango vinaigrette.  The size of the salad was gi-normous, but I managed to eat it all, including the highlight:  a half piece of buttery goodness corn bread.

Overall the night was an enjoyable one.  Our server, wasn't the fastest... but she kept our glasses refilled.  The lighting bothered me just a bit since it felt almost cave-like.  I guess it would have been a nice setting for a romantic date, but it was just a big group of friends trying to find each others faces in the dark."}
