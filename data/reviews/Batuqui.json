{"text":"Probably my favorite place in all of Cleveland and definitely one of the best places on the east side. I've had most entires on the menu and they are all great. Personal favorite, the Xim Xim. Awesome addition to the Larchmere neighborhood. Cozy little place in the winter. Plenty of outdoor seating in the summer. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best food in Cleveland!   We tried the steak, chicken, shrimp pasta, and several other entrees that were all amazing.  We had the hot shrimp, fried chicken, empenadas, and sausage for appetizers and all were great.  The staff was fantastic and overall was a great night.  The food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my Aunt and cousin. The food was delicious. From the brunch menu, I ordered the omelette with house potatoes and orange juice. The omelette was perfect, with cheese turkey bacon, red peppers, onions and mushrooms, and hearts of palm. The house potatoes were seasoned perfectly and were delicious without ketchup! The orange juice tasted freshly squeezed and was a nice compliment to the meal. 

My aunt had the chicken salad sandwich and my cousin has the picahana (spelling?) and chicken thigh. I sampled both and they were delicious as well. I would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Most excellent. I really can't afford to eat there but I splurged and spent the dough anyway. I sat at the bar and ordered food to go because my room mate won't go out to dinner with me in public. We had a rice coconut chicken dish and we loved it. Then we ordered mariscos with pasta. My home cooked dish is just as good and Sandra said so. She gave them a 6/10 and I said what! Am I that bad of a cook? She saw the errors of her ways and I adjusted her figures. We gave them a 10/10. Mariscos were perfectly cook, the sauce was tangy with of character and the pasta was cooked perfectly! Sheesh! Please eat here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great little spot! The food was wonderfully prepared, beautifully seasoned, and portions were generous. The waitstaff including the bus boy, were delightful. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, fun server, great atmosphere, made for a wonderful evening out. We will be back!
Everyone liked their meals, I loved the shrimp appetizer, had a nice kick and flavor. My husband had the fish special and I had the shrimp special, both delicious.

Nice to find a local, neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fine, that was the only thing I liked about the place. Everything is very overpriced, especially the house drink which was mostly sugar and lime pulp and nearly undrinkable. I didn't want to pay $16 for a salad so my gf and I decided to split a callimari appetizer. We both assumed it would be fried but it was raw squid in what seemed like spaghetti-Os. That may have been our fault though, I'm not sure if it mentioned that on the menu or not. Either way, my gf had to eat raw squid because I couldn't and it was too expensive to waste. The guy next to me had beans and sausage, it looked good, if I ever had to go there again I'd take out a loan and get that."}
{"text":"Stopped by while shopping at nearby antique shops. So glad we did. Started with drinks featuring the Brazilian liquor cachaca   Wow!! Immediately brought back memories of our trip to Rio last year. Cod croquettes and calamari appetizers were perfect. I had the shrimp moqucua and my husband had the Prato misto. Loved them both. Wish we had something like this in Pittsburgh. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"My first evening at Batuqui was late after a dance class in Cleveland. I was blown away by the welcoming porch entrance... the vibe inside... and I can only begin to share all the delights on the menu. I could point to their names on the menu but alas, can only assure you that you will go back and daydream about your next meal. There's a lime drink and a strawberry drink that are both delicious! Try them both! They are genuine! There's a popular dish I've had repeatedly that begins with an M. I choose fish ... it's in a bowl, but it's not soup. Seriously, I'm hungry just typing. Do have the warm coconut cake for dessert! There's a steak that is out of this world. Wave if you see me!! I love this restaurant!! The staff is charming, warm and friendly. The food is outstanding and made to order. The ambiance is uniquely a delight."}
{"text":"On a very cold snowy evening in January we entered into this house on Larchmere. And during our entire stay for my wife and I it remained too cold inside for us.  We started with the shrimp malagueta appetizer: it looked red hot and spicy but was actually mild and delicious, a good start. Our Bossa Nova salads I thought were limp with a too mild not very tasty citrus like dressing with tasteless, probably not fresh, very hard pistachios. The soup of the day, chicken with rice, was also mild, not a standout for flavor, nothing unusual, and could have been hotter. I had the Bobo shrimp special: a delicious rice dish strong on coconut milk. My wife had a scrumptious vegetarian dish, the vegetarian feijoada which was said to contain smoked tofu; we found 1 cube of tofu! Yes it had beans and rice but a bit more tofu would have been nice. The dining area  and the bar  are contiguous. Service was good. This is a casual dining establishment, no tablecloths. We'll be back, perhaps in the spring or summer. In the meantime, they might consider a space heater on those cold winter days or perhaps turn on the gas fireplace. But maybe those steps would violate code."}
{"text":"This is such a nice spot in a great location. The wait staff was extremely helpful/knowledgeable about the menu and gave good suggestions. Ceviche was amazing. Desserts (chocolate and butter cakes) were incredible."}
{"text":"Super!  Misty was my server, I was on a sentimental journey after a day on my tour of duty and went past the house in Cleveland Heights where a family member had recovered from her bone marrow transplant 11 years ago.  I was hungry but it was hot so I considered Brasilian food to be perfect and it was.  Very sophisticated and skillful preparation by an expert chef, good wine offerings with a lot of variety, and yummy desserts but not too sweet. My experience at Batuqui was perfect and we'll be back on our next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We are a family that opened the doors of our home so the Cleveland family can dine with us 6 days a week. 

Thanks everyone for your support.

Bruna - Batuqui Family."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here Sunday night. We were a party of 6 adults and 3 hungry/cranky kids. The service was great. They got the appetizers right out before the kids melted down. We kept asking for things: plastic cups, more silver wear, etc and they were very responsive. The waiter helped us through the menu. He had a great personality. Everything we ordered was delish. Loved the calamari, hearts of palm salad and fish stew. The pitcher of caipirinha was huge and very good. We had two desserts: the coconut cake and passion fruit mousse and both were really good. We will definitely be back but hopefully without the kids next time so we can enjoy a more leisurely meal!"}
{"text":"We always look forward to coming to Batuqui for a wonderful dining experience.  The delicious Brazilian cuisine and the warm embrace of the staff create a dining experience unparalleled anywhere else in Cleveland.

This is our \"go to\" place for a great meal and a warm welcome every single time!!

Batuqui will be around for a long, long time...."}
{"text":"Given that I hadn't heard much about Batuqui, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew the atmosphere would be nice, since I had dined in the restaurant that was previously in this spot. But the food! What a wonderful surprise! The appetizer of mixed \"bar snacks\" were as good as any tapas I have had - and both stews that we ordered were just fabulous - fresh, delicious and generous portions. Friendly and professional staff as well. This one is a winner and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Batuqui is a great East Side addition.  My wife and I went the last two Saturdays--because it is that good.  The food is fresh and full of flavor.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy with outside seating in the front and back.  The staff is friendly, and I was always waited on when needed.  This weekend the owner came around to check on us.  For a new restaurant, it is run very well.

The drinks are good.  The appetizers are good.  The prices are very reasonable.  I write very few Yelp reviews, but I felt like I had to write something quickly because this new restaurant is amazing.  It's easily one of my favorites in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Having been to Brazil a couple of times this place took me back to the meals I would have after a day of training for soccer down there.  The food is very authentic and tasteful.  There really isn't anything on the menu that would disappoint.  I remember the first time going to Brazil and the first night we had a chance to head out into town to see the night life they told us to try their famous drink Caipirinha.  Good thing we didn't have a game the next day because that is one strong drink but very refreshing.   I highly recommend trying one here it is spot on especially in the summer on their very nice patio."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always had a good time in here. If you love Brazilian food or want to try it, you should come. 
Hint: always call ahead to make a reservation or you may not find a place to seat."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Batuqui yesterday and all really enjoyed our meals. We got the mussels and cheese bread as appetizers, and Moqueca Baiana with shrimp, the Churrasco Misto and the Churrasco de Picanha. The mussels, cheese bread and churrasco were all excellent. The Moqueca was good too, sort of similar to a Thai curry because of the coconut milk. The best part of the meal was the coconut cake for dessert. DO NOT MISS THE COCONUT CAKE. I would give it a five except there were flies that we kind of had to work to shoo away the entire meal. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"What a great find over on the East side of Cleveland near the heights.  The Larchmere neighborhood has some good spots, and this place ranks right up there.  My wife and I had dinner here before a recent theatre show downtown.

The space is cozy and intimate without a corporate bone in its body.  The restaurant is housed within an old home making for unusual spaces and interesting decor.  Our table was quite close to the couple next to us, and we struck up an immediate conversation and friendship with these folks.  It added to the uniqueness of the experience, for sure.

Both my wife and I started off the evening with a traditional cocktail...the premium Caipirinha, but we ordered it with light sugar so that it wasn't super sweet.  It definitely reminds me of a Mojito, but had a much tangier (sour?), brighter note to it.  We each ordered a main dish and no appetizers as we wanted to save room for dessert instead.

My wife ordered off of their Specials menu, and I got the Moqueca Baiana with shrimp.  Her dish was cod fish based and served in a warmed dish.  She seemed to enjoy it, but said it had a strong fishy taste to it.  I, on the other hand, really loved the Moqueca Baiana which was kind of like a shrimp stew served in a tangy coconut milk based sauce over rice.  It had a slightly sweet creaminess that paired really well with the tomatoes and rice.  I sopped up every bit of it!

For dessert, we'd heard great things about their coconut butter cake and we had left juuust enough room to handle it.  My wife ordered a Brazilian coffee (which was smooth, flavorful and delightful) and we shared the cake which was decadent.  It was served warm with a deliciously sticky syrup making for fantastic bite (after bite!).

This place is a keeper, for sure.  Can't wait to get back and try more dishes from the menu...oh, and the coconut cake (again) as well."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant nestled in the east side of Cleveland near the heights/shaker area! I came here for restaurant week and had the most amazing 3 courses of food I've had in a while. 

1st course: Pao De Queijo, basically baked dough filled with cheese, but it wasn't oily and had an interesting, earthy quality that was simply amazing.

2nd course: Moqueca Baiana -Traditional Brazilian stew from bahia. This dish reminded me of a thai curry dish - made with tomato, onions, cilantro, organic coconut milk & dende oil, served with Brazilian rice. It was topped with a fried plantain and I was sad when it was finished. The amount of flavors packed into this dish was mind-boggling!

3rd course: Pudim de Leite, a Brazillian style flan, that was pretty similar to normal flan. A perfect end to a perfect meal. 

On top of everything above, our server was attentive and informative. The ambience was quaint and homey, with a fireplace greeting you upon entrance. I will definitely be back to sample Batuqui's normal menu offerings!"}
{"text":"I ordered Carolina Pasta which was very delicious. The atmosphere and the service were very good, too. I like this place very much and would like to recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Delicious muscle you have to try them. The atmosphere was awesome I really enjoyed the service and the food was good"}
{"text":"This was our first visit, it was raining so we sat on the porch. The food was spectacular! The favors in my vegetable stew were unlike anything I've had before. My husbands's chicken with peanut dish was likewise very tasty.  The crowning glory was the passion fruit mousse. A small billing mistake was quickly remedied. Valet parking is provided. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So, this place just opened two days ago and they were absolutely slammed when we arrived. It's obvious there are organizational kinks to work out (like having a hostess stand to greet people and take names down), and I'm sure those things will occur, but the food and the ambiance are amazing even now.

We ordered the calamari samba and the pao de queijo (little cheese bread balls) for appetizers. The calamari eats like a soup with real pieces of squid floating in a spicy broth and crunchy buttery bread squares for dipping. The pao de queijo was perfectly fluffy and cheesy and paired well with our calamari samba/stew.

We, of course, also had the best caipirinhas I've had since I lived in Brazil. So refreshing.

For entrees, we indulged on Carolina's Pasta and Moqueca Baiana, and the latter stole the show! Coconut milk soaked rice topped with fresh baked fish filets and enough green chilies and peppers to make your tastebuds melt. I could eat it everyday and never go without.

Finally, we finished with the mousse de maracuja, a fluffy, decadent passion fruit mousse that perfectly finished off the meal!

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and everyone in Batuqui was happy and conversational. As a resident who lives just a few streets down, I'm very excited to see Batuqui continue to thrive!"}
{"text":"When they first opened the food and prices were awesome. Then they jacked up the prices and reduced the size of the portions. The last time I went the calamari was so over-cooked it was inedible - on our fist trip it was our favorite dish. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that the service is excellent. They replaced my calamari (even though I told them I would replace with a salad) and didn't charge me. Unfortunately it was still over-cooked, just less so than the first batch. Sad that they are following the trend of other Cleveland restaurants overcharging for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Good place with a good friendly atmosphere. Food and wine selections were very good. Luved the authentic Brazilian food. Good spices and very tasteful. Everyone is very friendly. Liked hanging out at the bar. Will come back to enjoy the outdoor patio and the Latin music. Would most definitely recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant! We started with the Calamari Samba. Amazing flavor. My husband had the Brazilian party plate and I had the traditional
Brazilian stew. Also amazing. The cocktails were great. The ambiance was great. The service was perfect. I truly have nothing negative to say. It was our first visit so we stuck to the traditional menu options but I cannot wait to go back and try everything!"}
{"text":"We came here for something different. Wow. We even had to ask our server what is your favorite as the menu was a bit out of our norm. We got what Emily said and were not disappointed in the slightest.  Yummy shrimp appetizer with which we dipped cheese bread in the garlic sauce. Seafood stew was stupendous. The drinks are memorable- fresh and exciting. Passion fruit dessert was also memorable. We can not wait to come back and try what the table next to us ordered- none of which is the same as we got but all looks great. Casual, fun, and a place we will come back to in a second."}
{"text":"Thanks to this marvelous gem uniquely located inside the lower floor of a colonial house, you don't have to get a visa in order to try authentic Brazilian cuisine! The menu has numerous entrees, appetizers, and cocktails that provide a glimpse into the regional cooking traditions unique to the state of Brazil from which the owners hail. Since I don't eat a lot of meat, I went with the Prato Misto, a balanced yet delectable combination of beans, yucca, vegatables, rice, and seasoning that was a pleasure to eat! Next time, I will be sure to try to cheese  read and will definitely save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambiance!
carla the owner is so approachable and kind! we will surely go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Soft upbeat music. We had the mussels, steak, tapas. So excellent. The ambiance was lovely. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Those who know me know I am of Latin descent in my previous life. I love Mexican, Brazian, Columbian, Venezuelan,... ya the list goes on...
I often write reviews on Mexican and Columbian but it is time for Brazilian!

On one of the quaint streets of Cleveland..Larchmere area, sits in a cool old house... Batuqui!
Front yard patio for warm days and adorable little restaurant on the \"living room\" side and bar and a couple bistro tables on the \"dining room\" side.  Upstairs in not included in the restaurant as in Felice a few doors down the road.

It is owned and operated by Carla. A beautiful native of Brazil.
Her menu is authentic and boasting the genuine flavors of the country.  Comforting cuisine with a sultry flair.
Well designed meals ... seasonings and combinations to warm your heart and soul.

Only one or two drawbacks...
The bartender is unfriendly, distant and borderline Rude. Not a feather in anyone's cap because I can SPEND SOME MONEY ... IF I AM HAPPY and YA KNOW IT!
Secondly, as authentic as it is, dishes are over priced for the portions.  I tried a few items and seriously was disappointed by the portion vs the prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just ok. I like that the Brazilian flair and cuisine are different for Cleveland and the food was good but not for the price. The picanha was very tough and not a good quality piece of meat, considering the cost. The passion fruit mousse is exquisite. I would recommend giving it a try if you are looking for something different but some of the food is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Came here today with a friend for early dinner and we were so happy with our choice! The good was phenomenal, the service was outstanding and the ambiance is perfect! We made reservoir 3pm and were seated right away on the front patio. I started with a lemonade and calamari in tomato/coconut milk sauce with crostini that was to die for!! The entrees were absolutely delicious as well and my friend said her two cocktails were delicious and strong! This place is a little expensive, but well worth it for the quality, service, and experience! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Update! Just had a horrible experience at this restaurant. I met my brother whom was in town from Houston for dinner and I strongly suggested Batuqui. I then suggested the steak as one of the top options which we both ordered medium well. After about 30 mins the bartender Juliana came out to tell us the steaks were prepared well done and that she was gonna have them re make them for us. My brother and I were understanding and said ok thank you. Then after another 30 mins they brought out our plates with 2 steaks each so I thought to myself hey they are trying to make up for the long wait. Then I cut into both steaks, one was well done and the other was very over cooked and dry. I don't understand how you mess up 4 steaks! I sent mine back and my brother just struggled through his food. I expected them to discount the bill in some way but of course they didn't. I paid $78 to go home hungry after working a 12hr day. I won't be back for a while if ever. Oh and by the way, we were the only two people in the restaurant! Juliana was great though and her drinks were good so I still tipped her."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!  My son and I enjoy trying different cuisine.  The food was wonderful and the service was excellent. The atmosphere was quaint and cozy.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was so charming and very excited to tell us about Brazilian food. The quality of the salmon was exceptional. It was the most perfect set I've ever tasted. 
They also have a great drinks list."}
{"text":"I think I died and went to Brazilian heaven!! The food, the drinks, the service!! All superb!! The restaurant is one of the most quaint and attractive that I have ever been to and I have been to a lot of places to eat!  Thank you for a delightful meal from the sangria, the queso blanko to the warm, inviting smile on the staff!  I will be back as often as possible!!!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp!  Loved the front outdoor patio!  The bar is very nice and inside of restaurant as well.  Our dinner was amazing!!!!  My husband and I both had the moqueca Baiana.  I had shrimp and he had shrimp and fish.  Both were delicious!!!  The fish added a different taste to his meal which was excellent!  Lovely night out!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience. The service, food and atmosphere all exceeded our expectations. I eat out in Cleveland relatively frequently and never leave reviews. I felt obliged to leave a glowing review based on my unexpectedly great experience.

Our server was extremely kind, attentive and helpful. The food was surprisingly excellent. We had a grilled hard cheese entree (a Brazilian version of grilled haloumi) which was a special that was fantastic. We also had the shrimp malagueta which was so well seasoned and slightly spicy. For entrees we had a special which was a fish from the Amazon with coconut milk, peppers and rice and then the Xim Xim (a Brazilian chicken stew with peanuts over rice) which is one of the best dishes I've had in Cleveland.

Please just go and experience it yourself, you will be surprised and delighted."}
{"text":"The \"organizational kinks\" mentioned in the first review is an understatement. I made a reservation for 3 people here for this past Sunday. We arrived a few minutes early and they had our reservation on the books, but were not able to seat us. The restaurant was not yet full, but the hostess asked if I had just made the reservation earlier that day and then said they couldn't fit us in after all. It was pretty surprising .... I've never been flatly turned away from a restaurant where I have had a reservation. Disorganized and unprofessional. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the special which was fish in a spicy coconut milk broth. OMG! That should be added to their regular menu. Their version of margaritas are also exceptional, we ordered a pitcher. Service was great and ambience was fun!"}
{"text":"Great meal at Batuqui tonight.  We started w/the Bossa Nova salad, fresh and delicious.  I had the Moqueca Baiana with shrimp, the shrimp were huge and juicy, with great flavor.  My husband had the Churrasco de Picanha and devoured his delicious grilled steak.  The outside patio was the perfect place to sit on such a lovely evening.  Our server was attentive and helpful. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We loved everything about this restaurant tonight!Adorable setting, everyone super friendly. This made for a wonderful evening with a group of people we haven't dined out with for a long time.  My husband and I had the white fish from the Amazon.  I can't remember the name.  It was one of the specials and it was amazing.   I ordered the coconut cake for dessert.  My husband asked our waitress if they ever offered an entire cake for sale!if you haven't been here yet, you must go.  Beautiful menu!"}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the menu and decided to give it a try.  Nice variety of appetizers and entrees.  Not quite as adventurous as I had expected.  Worth a visit if you are in the area and interested in something different."}
{"text":"This place is exotically delicious! The food definitely takes your tastebuds to international delight! My boyfriend ordered the steak which was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth tender. I chose to go on a tasting adventure and ordered the Moqueca with shrimp. The Moqueca was marvelous and full of exotic flavors that complimented the sweet shrimp! The service made me feel like I was visiting a family friends from Brazil. I can't wait to go back to go on another tasting adventure!"}
{"text":"Batuqui has a great patio and is located on Larchmere.  I need to try more of the menu.  This was my first time trying Brazilian cuisine. The xim xim was a stew with shredded chicken carrots served over white rice.  I found it too salty but after adding lemon it was decent.  I would like to try the seafood stew or shrimp appetizer or carolinas pasta next visit,  I want to like this place since its different and in a great area.  I just wasn't overly impressed with the flavor of the Xim Xim.  Entrees are around 12-20$, drinks around 10$.  The best feature is the outdoor seating perfect to enjoy Cleveland summers."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant. First they've set us at a table where I've had to constantly move my chair for every passing person. Then we requested to change the table. This time the person right next to us hit my table and broke my wine glass with red wine spilling on everything. They didn't even offer to bring a new glass of wine. Only the empty glass. They took our appetizers before we were done. We had to ask for silverware twice. The house special was mediocre. I must say I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not great.  Prices are high for a neighborhood \"joint\" and service is amateurish.  This will not be a regular stop for us, but if someone else wants to go, we will not try to dissuade him."}
{"text":"The salmão and shrimp baiana were both delicious.  The salmon glaze was amazing and the flavor of the shrimp was delicate and fragrant.  Service was extremely friendly.  Can't wait to go back and try their other items."}
{"text":"We arrived at Batuqui on a cool Saturday evening. We were greeted by welcoming staff who were happy to help us find seatings. The entire ambiance was both friendly and warm. It was like your neighbor invited you over for dinner, except that the food was so bomb. We originally came here because Felice had a 30 minute wait, but we all strongly preferred this over Felice. 4 guest from Chicago all say"}
{"text":"I love when a place has great service and great food! Charming restaurant with a very knowledgeable staff that serves up some very fresh and authentic flavors. Go, be Brazilian, and enjoy!   Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Food is great, staff is kind and lovely, atmosphere is likewise lovely. I only wish they had a few more vegetarian options. The cocktails are delicious."}
{"text":"I was so very disappointed. I was expecting deeply flavorful, fully flavored food. The best item was the naturally flavored plaintain. The Yucca could have been great, but they failed to offer any dipping sauce (I would expect some delicious and unique) We asked for plain old ketchup and it never arrived. The wait staff were not very attentive and at times, one of the ladies working wasn't very friendly or helpful. I expected much more, but I won't be back nor recommend anyone to visit."}
{"text":"Is very authentic brazilian food, taste and amazing im was feeling like i was in Brasil, great service."}
{"text":"A nice little gem in the Larchmere area. Went here today and was pleasantly surprised. I'll start with the ambience is great, we loved the setting. The service was great as well, our server made sure to check on us throughout our visit the appropriate amount of times..based on this being our first visit. We had the Churrasco Misto and the Fejoi Da both had lots of flavor and were filling. The steak was a little dry but has good flavor. The combination of all the flavors in the Fejoi  Da was perfect."}
{"text":"I'm coming back for more! I ordered the Vegetarian Plate-Prato Misto and was really impressed with all of the different flavors and how they complimented each other.  That can only mean that the other dishes are the same.  I was dining with someone from Brazil and she said that the food here was very authentic and represented the cuisine of Brazil accurately.  Make sure you order the Caipirinha- a delicious and strong drink made with Cachaca (a liquor made from sugar cane).  The waiter was really cool too.  So patient and welcoming.  Impeccable service."}
{"text":"We stopped at Batuqui because Felize's patio is under construction. LUCKY US ! They have a lovely patio (we ate in the rear. Also one up front.) Really nice menu choices, incl wine list. My husband and I shared an app, had 2 delicious dinner entrees, plus 2 great desserts. All cooked dishes were served piping hot & cooked perfectly. The main course didn't show up until we had leisurely enjoyed our appetizer.( Hate how some places rush the dishes out.) Our server, Nicholas, could not have been better--- knowledgeable, charming, and the perfect amt of attention. We live on the other side of town but will SO be back here. A really lovely experience !."}
{"text":"Man, I was super impressed with Batuqui.  We went on Sunday night and it was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We really loved the atmosphere as well.  It's in a very intimate setting with not very many tables, in an old home full of character and wood.  It felt kinda European.  Anyways, I ordered a beer, the husband ordered a sangria which was delicious.  For appetizers we shared the cheese bread and the husband had shrimp malagueta.  I don't eat seafood, but dipped the bread in the sauce which was incredible.  It was spicy and citrusy and just f**king awesome.  Oh, the bread was great too.  For our entrees, the hubs got xim xim and I the vegetarian feijoda.  We both agreed that the feijoda was just incredible.  He liked the xim xim alot, but kept eating my feijoda.  We were way too full for dessert, but maybe next time.  This spot has been home to a couple of previously unsuccessful restaurants in the past, but I'm pretty sure Batuqui has staying power.  We will definitely be back, and you should go too!"}
{"text":"I got the moqueca with fresh tilapia.  My wife hit the xim xim.  Both were very mild and tasty.  The palmito salad is very good with a tangy dressing.  

The restaurant is small, so make a reservation.  The employers and owners really care about the food and the overall experience.  We brought our baby and forgot to tell them beforehand.  Even in a cramped space they made it work and didn't at all make us feel bad for their inconvenience in making us comfortable.  

Use the valet, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Great specials and very friendly staff.

Try the Moqueca Baiana, the churrasco de Picanha, and the coconut butter cake."}
{"text":"been here twice loved it both times my advice is to always make a reservation before you visit this place so that you get a decent table. other than that i really enjoyed the food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. I was invited to come watch the Brazil fútbol match and this restaurant had absolutely no idea what they are doing to handle a crowd.we grabbed a table because we were told it was first come first serve and then that was not the cases.we waited at the bar for 30 minutes to order a drink and literally were told that it would be one minute. 30 minute later no drink, no food order placed and still no waitress at our table outside at the watch party. The \"manager\" apologies but just blames it on her country's people and the culture of chaos. Which in my opinion is a shame to throw your people under the bus..the ones who are here supporting your country proudly and your ill managed establishment.  

I can't comment on the food, or drinks because we couldn't even get a water on this scorcher of a day. 

I wish Brazil luck in the tournament but for this place I have no luck to pass on."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Batuqui on Saturday night. Was our first visit. Met the owner, Carla and ordered on her recommendations - the steak and seafood stew (can't remember the Brazilian names). Our food was delicious. Will be going back to try other menu items as well.

Batuqui is in an old home and has a small indoor space - a lively, comfortable atmosphere. We met a few people at the bar that said the outdoor space is huge and wonderful for days with good weather."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since moving back to CLE from So Cal and have been very impressed with this restaurant. The \"house\" setting feels so friendly and inviting in the cold winter months. I also hear their back patio is awesome in the warmer months, I look forward to checking that out spring 2016. 

Last night we took my dad here for his 71st b-day. Food was excellent and the service was great too. Excellent drinks, the owner is hands on ensuring quality and excellence.

Lovely place, I cannot recommend it enough!

¡Obrigado!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!! It was our first time there and we loved to eat the Brazilian food again!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden Brazilian gem on the east side of Cleveland.  This is one of those places you have to try early on before it gets too popular.  From what I hear this place is the place to go during the warmer months with its large outdoor patio, music, and drinks - however, having visited in the middle of December during one of the first snow downfalls, I can say the indoor experience was still well worth the trip.  Not your typical Brazilian barbecue restaurant - this place offers a wide range of home cooked dishes in addition to the typical barbecued meats.  They also have a mean Caipirinha and light appetizers in case you are looking for a lighter fare.

Walking into to this restaurant, I was a bit surprised at the coziness of this restaurant.  There is a small bar up front and a small 2 room dinning room to the side - can't of been more than 10 tables within the indoor dining area.  Not much space to wait up front or sit at the bar, but luckily we were able to be seated quite quickly.  I imagine on a busier night they would have to turn patrons away as there is not much space to hold people up front.

Started with the premium Caipirinha - get the premium, its worth it.  They use the Leblon brand of the liquor which has a better flavor.  And for those who don't like too sweet drinks - I would also recommend getting it with light sugar as the default pour is usually way too sweet.

For appetizers, we started with the shrimp and fried chicken.  The shrimp was definitely our favorite.  The chicken was good to munch on as well - we enjoyed the sauce pairing with the chicken.

For the dinner entree, went with the standard Picanha steak.  For those who visit the Brazilian BBQ restaurants, this is usually the house special steak which looks like a rounded sirloin cut.  In short, Batuqui nailed it - one of the best I have had - including a tour of Brazil last year along with frequent visits to Fogo de Chao.  They serve the steak on a sizzling hot plate (nice touch) which keeps it nice and hot though the meal.  The house recommends ordering one level lower than typical as the steak is sitting on a hot plate and will cook over time.  I still went with my typical order of medium and was very pleased with the outcome.  I always love how the Brazilians concentrate on the fundamentals for a good steak - quality meat, with light salt seasoning, and a perfect cook.

Wrapped up the meal with an order of the coconut topped cake.  Was very rich and was prepared very well - definitely a share dessert.

Overall, will honestly say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service level of this restaurant.  Does not have all the bells and whistles of your typical Brazilian steakhouse - but it delivers a strong punch with its authentic home cooked cuisine and its friendly staff.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Cleveland's thriving restaurant scene.  If you take your date here...you will look like a hero.  Great patio outside, great ambiance inside.  I have been twice and the food  and drinks have been stellar.

If you are looking for a restaurant with character, charm, unique creative cuisine, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I wish we had tried this restaurant sooner! One of the best and most unique restaurants I've eaten at in Cleveland. The food was phenomenal, the patio was lovely (one in front and in back) and the service was spectacular! One of the owners waited on us, and the other owner thanked us and chatted with us briefly as we were leaving. The owners seemed like very nice people who really take pride in their restaurant and truly care about their customers' experience. We were so impressed and cannot wait to return with our friends/family!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this quaint little spot. The hand crafted, authentic drinks are on point. The service is wonderful. And the food is fresh, flavorful and unique.  I'm just taking away one star due to the valet boy who was on his phone while we sat in front of the restaurant for about 5-8 min waiting for him to take our car and for our food taking quite a long time to come out on the first night. We actually went twice while we were here in town. It's a must try while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  I came here with my wife and we had an amazing time. The food is very much authentic Brazilian and very delicious!"}
{"text":"A great place to visit on a warm summer night. Larchmere Blvd is a beautiful neighborhood and Batuqui fits in great. 
Our party of four had a reservation and we were greeted courteously and taken to our table which was located in the back yard of this residence-turned-restaurant. 
We started the evening with a pitcher of Caipirinha and opted for the traditional lime version instead of the alternative passion fruit caipirinha. At $45 for the pitcher, we managed to squeeze a little over five glasses out of this (slightly weak) refreshing drink. 
Our initial choices of appetizers, Bolinho de Bacalhau (cod croquettes) and Pao de Queijo (GF Brazilian cheese bread) were out for the evening, undoubtedly related to our 8:15 PM reservation. Our waiter made a plate of pan-fried Brazilian cheese appear (thanks!) and it tasted a little like Queso Fresco when fried. We also ordered the Shrimp Malagueta which were savory and tasty. 
Our entrees were the Xim Xim (delicious), Churrasco Misto (excellent), and two of us opted for the Feijoada. I had the Feijoada and it was absolutely great - I'd order it again in a heartbeat. 
Batuqui is a perfect summer-time treat. A relaxed atmosphere, super friendly wait staff, great food, and fitting music makes Batuqui a wonderful destination for those of us who don't have the deep pockets for a quick flight to Rio."}
{"text":"It's in a blue house, it can be crowded, and I'm glad we weren't seated at the table next to the bathroom. If you can get over that, you're going to have an incredible time. The food is delicious. There really isn't anything like it in CLE that I've experienced. I wish I could remember the names of the dishes but I had the spicy pasta with seafood and that description does not do it justice, loved the red cream sauce. My wife had the seafood stew, again, I'm murdering the description, it was amazing, I want to say saffron? I don't know, my wife is smarter than me, I should have her write this. Just go, it's worth a try and I bet you'll be glad you did. I found the atmosphere cozy, but I can understand others complaints about being cramped. I hear they routinely receive accolades and it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. I am a big fan of Brazilian food and wish we had more options. 

This place is in a beautiful house. The ambience is full of charm and character and albeit small seems comfortable. 

The food is good but not outstanding particularly in regards to pricing and portions. Definitely worth a shot if you're looking for a nice and unique dining experience and are willing to pay a little more for it."}
{"text":"I organized my girlfriend's surprise birthday party here. Great cozy place, great food, we were treated like family. Carla and her staff really cared about the event working out for us. Five stars, definitely. A Cleveland gem that everyone should check out. Can't wait for summer, to see their patio/deck and some live music!"}
{"text":"I got the Feijoada. It's nicknamed the Brazilian party dish, and its very tasty. Probably my first time having Brazilian food so I don't have a reference point, but I really enjoyed it! More on the heavy side probably. Portion sizes were good"}
{"text":"This place is one of those nice places on Larchmere which I think can really be a gem as the years go on.

We attended a birthday party here- sat in the back patio, which they had heaters for us, and even blankets for us, as it was getting chillier than we thought. It was such a cute set-up and it's a cute restaurant.

The food, overall, was cooked well- with lots of flavorful spices. For those who want the whole meat on a stick experience, they have that too- it looked delicious, but I didn't get a chance to try it.

I ordered the ensopada de porco, which was a very good sized dish, with pork, plantains, and rice. The overall flavor was great, although I did think if I was cooking it, I would cook the pork less, to make it less tough. He got the Moqueca Baiana, the vegetarian option, and it was delicious. It was almost like a curry, with such intense flavors and it was just really really good- I wish I would have ordered that dish instead.

The overall consensus from our group of 17 was that the food was really good. They can host large parties well (which is nice), and the food came out hot and fresh and oh so flavorful. I definitely would come back here to try more of the menu- it's definitely worth the stop if you're in Larchmere."}
{"text":"I hesitated writing this review...not because it wasn't delicious, fresh and flavorful food, or that it wasn't a charming restaurant with very knowledgeable and friendly staff, but because I'm afraid such a gem of a restaurant will be overrun by hipsters once the word gets out and we'll never get in again, but it's a chance I'm willing to take.  We didn't know much of anything about Brazilian food when we went there so I was a a little hesitant.   But we had no reason to fear.  Batuqui is a Brazilian dance, which is apt, as the Brazilian chef/owner's delicious food was not unlike a well choreographed dance.  

We had four different entrées, all of which had unique flavors that were so good u found yourself eating slower to savor it all & even my very finicky 12-year-old didn't leave so much as a grain of rice on his plate and fought me for the last mouthfuls of my dinner!  The shrimp appetizer & drinks were similarly well-prepared and delicious. My husband told the chef it was the best restaurant in all of Cleveland which is saying a lot because he frequently eats out for work at very expensive restaurants, so I was even surprised. The next day we all talked about when we might go again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! First time here and will be back. This food and service was pretty good...This true Brazilian"}
{"text":"Unbelievable restaurant. Small with an authentic feel and fabulous staff. Food was terrific. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"My family celebrated my sister's birthday at Batuqui tonight and we had a great time with excellent food and service.  The setting in a beautiful house on Larchmere was very nice.  If you are a fan of crown moldings, you are in luck!  Really though, our drinks and food fantastic.  The shrimp ceviche, mussels (a special), fried spinach, and codfish croquettes we had as apps were all good, but the ceviche and spinach were my favorites.  I chose the Churrasco de Picanha for my entrée and it was, just perfect.  Perfectly medium-rare as requested with telepathically correct seasoning re: salt and the accompanying rice, pinto beans, farofa and tomato relish delicious and perfectly matched to the cut of steak.  I tried several of the other entrées my family chose and I would have been happy if I'd ordered any of them myself.  We came with my niece who is 6 and the cheeseballs fit her needs perfectly and she even tried the spinach (which for her, green-colored food is usually an offense) and liked it.  They also prepared her some pasta and butter (being very kind to do so as it's not on the menu) and it looked awesome (I did not admittedly try it as there was more than enough food to try).  I will definitely go back.  Have heard the patio is beautiful when it's warm out."}
{"text":"Awesome Brazilian music, tropical decor, cool wait staff, fantastic drink and food. Had the Palmito Salad, Churrasco de Picanha, a Caipirinha and finished with a Pudim de Leite. Bravo!"}
{"text":"By far, the nicest spot in Cleveland.
Authentic and delicious brazilian food and drinks.
Great patio seating in the summer and very homy indoor atmosphere.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place has the classics. You will not be disappointed. The staff is attentive, the music and ambiance are inviting, and the food is delicious. Come to the quaint neighborhood of Larchmere for shopping and enjoy the delightful food too. The restaurant is more upscale. Mostly couples dining, but larger parties they can abominate on nice days on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and interesting- the shrimp appetizer was phenomenal. My husband got the lamb and it was great. Also, the chi chi (chicken stew) was so good! 

The service, was awful. We were seated at a lovely table (thinking it was because we were celebrating my 40th birthday) and after a few minutes, were told to move because some else wanted that table. We were then forced to stand at the bar area for a while before someone moved and we could sit. 

Bartender completely ignored us and we continued to wait for a drink. And she was so rude- only smiling at another patron at the end of the bar. 

Normally, we would eat at the bar, but she was just too much to handle. 

I'm bummed because I really loved the food, but the service was insulting, rude, and ruined my night. (Our waitress was nice, though!)?"}
{"text":"My wife and I drove out to larchmere yesterday intending to go to Barocco's. When we arrived (about 8pm on sat night) there was a line of hipsters out the door, preening, taking selfies and feigning disinterest. But I digress...

It looked like an hour+ wait, so disappointed - we walked down the block to Batuqui's. I'm so glad we did. We sat out back under the stars on a perfect September night with bossa nova playing in the background!

We both ordered the Moqueca Baiana, me with fish, my wife vegetarian. It was perhaps the best meal we've had in a restaurant in Cleveland all year. Every bite was teeming with flavor and we were both sad when we had completely cleaned our plates - though the portion was perfect as well . We were just greedy!

Everything was fabulous from the atmosphere to the cleanliness to the service. 

The hipsters can have Barocco, we'll take Batuqui any day!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The staff here are so pleasant and the food is phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anyone in Cleveland and looking for great food."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! Several friends and I had a great time trying Brazilian cuisine on their patio. The waiter was also very accommodating for our group and excellent. We tried several apps (pao de queijo, frango passarinho, Salgadinhos) and the churassco dishes as well as feijoada... All Delicious! Definitely will come back again to try desert :)"}
{"text":"Very impressed.  

So, I didn't quite know what to expect when I made a large group reservation.  It turns out the restaurant is located in an adorable little house in the Larchmere area.  I was pleasantly surprised by our equally cute little table set up in the room for our group.  
All the food we had was delicious - and surprising!  Much of the food is simple, without fancy concoctions but with good quality ingredients.  It made for a delicious menu that my group really appreciated!  

The trio of Brazilian bar snacks, and the Linguica with Mndioca Frita were nice to share and a great way to wet our pallets for our meal.  For entrees, most ordered steak, but the Xim Xim had a nice light spicy taste to it and the Feijoada was a great mix of beans and rice.  Everything tasted fresh and well prepared.  It was a great way to enter into what was otherwise an unknown food style for us!

The only complaint I had was service.  It was very difficult to get a servers attention.  Once they saw you, they quickly made sure we were taken care of, but there were a lot of waving of hands and trying to get attention when the servers wandered in and out in a different room in the house.  It was almost comical how hard we had to try to get everyone's attention, but so long as you have good humor, it really wasn't an issue."}
{"text":"A little bit expensive. We had six people and it costed each of us $50. Tastes good. Not too oily, not too sweet or salty."}
{"text":"Hello Batuqui! Where have you been all my life? My new favorite restaurant in CLE. Situated in a charming house convert to restaurant on the up and coming Larchmere road, find parking along the streets of you can. The smells alone right when you walk in is mesmerizing alone. Kinda small place, there's outdoor patio with about 4 small tables. Inside there's a bar with TVs. Cute ethnic decorations, with a casual atmosphere. 

Started with calamari, a little tough, immersed in a tomato stew. Not just rings, there are tentacles as well! Comes with 4 crustinis. Guilty of licking the bowl clean when no one was looking.

I went with their signature dish the shrimp moqueca baiana. Comes in a metal bowl about 9 inches in diameter. Rice on the bottom, with a seasoned cocunut milk stew on top and maybe 6 jumbo shrimp. 

Definitely returning to try more entrees on this menu ... So stay tuned for updates. I can't imagine anything on this menu is lackluster"}
{"text":"This place was so much different than I expected, in a very good way. For some reason, I had the uninformed impression that this was one of those giant AYCE Brazilian steakhouses, and for that reason, I was never quite interested. When making dinner plans with a friend who was moving from Cleveland in a few days, I urged her to pick a restaurant thinking there might be something she wanted to try before leaving the city. She chose Bataqui based on a friend's recommendation, and I'm glad she did because I wouldn't have chosen to come here otherwise. What stood out to me immediately was how eclectic and intimate the ambiance is here. The location is similar to a lot of Cleveland Heights houses, a bit old, a bit creaky and lots of charm. Filled with warmth and quirky bits of decor, it was a vibe I was not at all expecting. The service was equally warm and friendly, and my friend and I chose a Brazilian dark beer and caipirinha drink respectively. The beer was dark, but very smooth and medium-bodied, not at all akin to the maltiness of a Guinness. The caipirinha was similar to a margarita, but with a lot more lime and sweetness to it. We ended up ordering the Pao De Queijo (cheese bread) and mussels, but unfortunately the mussels never made it to our table as the chef decided they weren't fresh enough. We weren't disappointed though, because we picked the Frango Passarinho (fried chicken pieces with cilantro lime sauce) which was served on the house for our trouble. I would say the cheese bread for me personally was skippable, as it was quite dry and was more of a dry cheese bread rather than a gooey cheese bread you might expect. For our entrees, we chose the Picanha Acebolada (steak with onions, rice and beans) and the Moqueca Baiana (traditional Brazilian stew made with coconut milk and your choice of protein). My steak was absolutely fabulous, cooked perfectly and just the right amount of seasoning. By far, this was the standout for me. The rice and beans served on the side were a bit bland, and even though I really enjoy rice and beans, I wasn't too impressed with these. As for my friend's stew, it had a coconut forward flavor, with a nice mix of spices which reminded us of a sort of curry. We also ended up getting the coconut cake to share, which was tasty, but not overly sweet. 
All things considered, I was more impressed with Bataqui than I expected to be. Although I didn't find the food to be the sort that would bring me back, I did enjoy what I tried, and would probably come back here with my partner for the steak alone. In addition, the warm and cozy atmosphere was really what made me instantly feel drawn to this restaurant, and likely what would bring me back in the door. I would say it's worth a visit if you like smaller, more intimate restaurants and are open to trying some traditional Brazilian dishes."}
