{"text":"Good food, good price! $5 for a full banh mi sandwich. There weren't many places to sit, so it's better to grab takeout. Sandwich was very flavourful and a good size."}
{"text":"When a banh mi tastes this good for only $3 tax in, why would I ever buy them from anywhere else? Especially when these are cheaper, tastier, fresher and bigger than ones in Asian supermarkets.  The first time I came, I ordered a pork belly banh mi for $5 flat. De-freaking-licios. But then again, anything with pork belly is tasty. Toppings so fresh and crunchy.   Went in today, not feeling particularly hungry but knowing I should grab something to eat, I got a traditional cold cut banh mi. By the end of the sandwich I was licking the pate off the wrapper, looking longingly at the bits of cilantro and onion that fell on the ground. Damn was it good.  This place is in the middle section of the new plaza on the north side. Will come back here again and again."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick snack after work last week, while I was in the area. I remembered this banh mi place that had decent reviews, so I stopped by to grab one. My usual banh mi place is Nguyen Huong, since it is literally just down the street from where I live, but I haven't been going as much now that they upped the price of the standard banh mi to $2.50.   I got the Banh Mi 24 Cold Cut Sandwich for $3 (tax included).   The man working there (was he the owner?) asked me if I wanted it spicy, pretty standard, and if I wanted my bread toasted, which is more unusual, I never get asked that at Nguyen Huong. I love my bread toasted, so I got that and my sandwich to be not spicy. The banhi mi at 24 is a bit longer, comparable to the super banh mi at Nguyen Huong for $3. The bread was fresh, and since it was made to order unlike the often make-ahead standard ones at Nguyen Huong, the bread wasn't dried out and didn't crumble when I bit into it. There was butter, pate, 2 kinds of cold cuts, pickled carrots, cucumber, thinly sliced raw red onion, and cilantro in the sandwich. The cold cuts were good, but I saw him refill the containers with ones from a package, so its not like they made the cold cuts themselves. They put a lot of pate in the sandwich which I liked. The butter spread they used seems to have more mayo in it, there was a slight bit more tang to it. I also liked the addition of cucumber and red onion, which is different from Nguyen Huong. The cucumber makes the sandwich feel fresher and the red onion adds more flavour for me since I get my sandwich not spicy.          Once I started eating that sandwich, I couldn't stop. And since the sandwich is bigger than the standard sized ones I usually get at Nguyen Huong, I was stuffed. Soiled my appetite for dinner, sorry mom! Overall, I was quite impressed with my first experience with this place. Its definitely worth the extra few mins of waiting to get the bread toasted, and the sandwich made to order. I'll be back for more banh mi and maybe some other stuff as well."}
{"text":"Extremely filling and cheap sandwiches! But you have to make sure you go earlier in the day, the last two times I was there (closer to 7pm) they were completely out of bread hence no more sandwiches for the day. The cold cut sandwich is delicious, and the pâté is just ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Best traditional banh mi in the neighbourhood. They make it fresh in the spot so the bread isn't soggy. Love the pate. Got my coworkers hooked too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh sandwiches and desserts are my fave! So hard to find an authentic Vietnamese sandwich place in this area."}
{"text":"They recently changed owners and got rid of the side shop where the convince store was. Added 2 more tables inside and more items on the menu. The bread looks bigger than before and same ingredients. They added debit now. Give them a chance from the change, it's still the cheap price as before."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Great little shop that serves up freshly made banh mi as well as various traditional Vietnamese noodle soups.  Had the cold cut combo banh mi and all the ingredients in it tasted fresh. You can request your bread to be toasted or left as is.  Also tried their bun rieu cua which had a flavorful soup base with shrimp and crab paste. Noodles could have been more al dente but was overall satisfying.   Definitely a good spot for a quick and simple lunch. Most folks come in here for take out but there are also a few tables for dine-in."}
{"text":"I used to love their sandwiches. As i saw the 2 new negative review recently and i decided to prove it myself. I brought one only! The bun was small and the entire portion was SMALL, unlike before. I felt like they changed the ownership of the store. Sorry, i will not go back anymore."}
{"text":"This place is great! Quick. Cheap. Homemade and the food quality is wonderful. This place is a small joint that sells everything from noodles to fresh rolls to viet subs. It has that homemade feel and you can taste the love in everything that they do.  I ordered the grilled beef sub and cold cut sub. The buns were fresh and did not taste cheap. They also did not cheap out on the beef and cold cuts and give you a lot for $5 and their fresh rolls were delicious!  Come here for some wonderful cheap eat treats!"}
{"text":"I looove eating the banh mi here!! The owner is soo generous and gives lots of stuffings for the sandwich. I usually only order the cold cut and I really like the fact he gives lots of pate, pork belly and cucumber which makes the sandwich taste so much better than the ones at Nguyen Huong. The owner is really friendly too! Ever since I found out this place, I have not gone back to eat the banh mi at Nguyen Huong."}
{"text":"Viet subs don't cost $2 anymore because you can now get gourmet subs with not just your regular Vietnamese cold cuts. This place served grilled chicken, grilled beef subs and a few others. It was totally random that we came here because we stopped by to get bubble tea and was looking for a quick bite. Pulled out our trustworthy Yelp app and Banh Mi 24 was in the same plaza! A cute small shop owned by a family and they served not just subs but fresh rolls and noodle soup dishes. The son who made our sandwiches was friendly and extremely generous. There was definitely love used in making the food. The ingredients used were fresh and they definitely weren't stingy on the meat. You could easily pick up a filling sub at just $5 plus tax. Well worth the drive for a quick lunch in the area."}
{"text":"I use to LOVE going to this place- would grab a bunch so my colleagues and I could munch on goodness while we worked. The owner moved to Montreal and sold this place to a different family. The quality isn't the same anymore. I asked why there were no carrots and the gentleman told me \"ppl complain they don't taste good when they keep them in the fridge for a few days.\" The old owner would make the banh mi with love! You want a fried egg on it? He'll go to the back whip you up a fried egg and serve it to you- he was super generous with the portions! He even joked around and said \"If I'm not here and you want a fried egg on your sub tell my son his dad told him to make you one.\" Miss the old owners and have opted for Nguyen Huong instead."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly family owned business, they are very patient and quick.  the banh mi sandwiches are nice and big, good price and made to order. the noodles are exceptional, eat it there while it's hot if you can (there are 3 tables and 8 chairs)  and dessert is a must! try the puddings!!"}
{"text":"This place is near my home and I stopped by to see if it was as good as the other reviews on here said it is.  I got the cold cut viet sub for 3 dollars and I gotta say I'm very satisfied with the quality and the taste.  They added a bit of purple onion into the sandwich I got and it took the whole sandwich to another level which was a pleasant surprise since I never had it with purple onion with viet subs before.  Would come back if I ever crave me some viet subs!"}
{"text":"They had a change of management at least a few months ago. Ever since then, their filling to bun ratio has significantly decreased. Today, I had one bite in my entire banh mi that wasn't dry. That one bite was the only bite in which i could taste the pate in my sandwich. This is quite a sad fact because we had asked for extra pate, and the lady had even said she had put extra in there. If that is extra, I'm guessing that the norm is that there is no pate in your banh mi's..."}
{"text":"Several years ago my cousin introduced me to Vietnamese sandwiches and I have been in love with them ever Since!   While some of my favorite spots are downtown, I must say that the service here has been incredible! The guy who makes the sandwiches here really take his time to make sure they are to the highest standard. I especially like that we toasts my bread, it may not be authentic but I like the warm bread. The spread he uses has a nice tangy taste and a spicy finish. He does have all the meat selections, at this place the beef is my favorite, even thou I prefer pork.   They really have the art of sandwich making good ingredients combined with great service! This is why I go out of my way sometimes to come here. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"No tax $3 banh mi!  They also have a variety of other foods on the menu like fries and pudding. Great if you are around the area. Pate is rich"}
{"text":"Cheap eats on the go.  It might be a challenge finding the place. As you head south on Midland and pass Silver Star turn into the third drive way on your right. The addresses are located on the top of the buildings. Bahn Mi 24 will be on your right. Store is small, messy and unorganized. Slight communication barrier so I nodded, shook my head and pointed to make up for it.   I ordered the Bahn Mi 24 and the shrimp and crab paste noodle soup and hot milk tea to go. Cashier/cook was very friendly. I ordered, watched and coached her in making my sandwich (lots of pate and fresh cilantro YES!). I appreciated that she separated the soup from the rest of the ingredients so the noodles wouldn't soak up the soup and get soggy.    The bahn mi had decent flavor but I would have preferred a fresher crusty roll with the veggies pickled. The crab in the soup tasted like it came from a can but the soup was still tasty. Decent for cheap fast food."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here whenever I'm craving banh mi. I used to go to Nguyen Huong since it's only a few minutes away from me and I haven't been back there since. I've only tried their banh mi 24 (cold cut combo) but it's really good, because they put in more ingredients than just your typical coriander and pickled carrots and radish. On top of those staples, they put in cucumbers and onions - it doesn't seem like much more but it really adds depth to such a simple sandwich! The bread is great too, make sure you ask to get it toasted! (Other places I've been to have really hard bread that sometimes cuts the roof of my mouth, but it's nice and soft here.)  I also get the bun rieu (shrimp and crab paste noodles) occasionally. It's very flavourful and the portion is quite large for me. The value is excellent for $6 and they make it to order so everything is fresh.   I really like it here and super happy that for $9 you can get a large sandwich and a hearty bowl of noodles! It's a small place with 3 tables, so it seats about 6 people if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"I suggested to try this place out since my boyfriend is a fan of all types of sandwiches. (He can have sandwiches for lunch and dinner every day...) so to break apart from our usual franchise chain meal, I found this place offering made to order banh mi.   One issue I've always had with banh mi was that pre-made ones always came with cilantro which I cannot have. This place makes each sandwich to order, allowing you to pick and choose your toppings. With the price being $3 (cold cut) and $5 (pork belly/ grilled chicken/ pork).  We ordered one grilled chicken and one pork belly, both spicy and both very good. Definitely coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"This used to be a decent  place to get Vietnamese sub. I use to come here every couple week and get like 8 sub at a time. Now i was at the store yesterday, i noticed the counter server had changed to two chinese woman. obviously, they had no clue what they are doing. They said the store was not turned over by any matter. SO i end up buying 8 again.  The Sub became twice smaller than usual ! wtf the one i ask for not spicy had spicy... with green wrap.   I will NOT go back to this place anymore. Time to find a new place for sub."}
{"text":"It's an okay Banh Mi place but because they make them per order it takes some time if you are in the rush. Other places seem to move a lot quicker so prepare to spend some time waiting. Bread is good and the selection of meats are also good. Don't like the addition of onions though, it was too strong."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time and just read the reviews and notice the place has new management. Guess I won't going here today or ever again. I called to ask if it's new owners and they told me it was new management. They are Chinese. The last owners were Vietnamese. Annoys me when businesses go cheap on the food. I predict this place is going to end up closing down if they keep up with the cheapness."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly, sandwiches are superb and carefully crafted.  Lots of pate, and goodies and only $3.50 tax included.    Best cheap banh mi ive had in this city so far."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout sandwiches!  It's a very small shop/convenience store that only has one table and seating for two.  I've been here twice and the service is always great and the bahn mi sandwiches are delicious!  They are made with pate, garlic mayo, pickled veggies, red onion and jalapeño peppers.  Amazing value at $3-5 depending on which sandwich you choose.  They also offer some other dishes and hot drinks."}
{"text":"This plave is dirty. They forgot my raw beef..the lady from the kitchen came out with a bowl and dumped raw beef in my bowl without saying anything...then she's said i forgot...WTF!"}
{"text":"It seems like a small family restaurant. I had the chicken and pork belly banh mi. They were so delicious and the vegetables had nice portions in them. They are 5 dollars each but for the size of the sandwich its well worth it. The place its kinda small to eat there. Has a few tables. But overall i would come back 4.5/5"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Vietnamese sandwiches and since we don't always want to drive all the way to Nguyen Huong, we were happy to find a bahn mi joint closer to home.    My husband ordered the bahn mi 24 and I ordered the shrimp and crab paste noodle soup.  The bahn mi came on a freshly toasted baguette with layers of cold cuts, yummy pickled radish and carrots and enough cilantro and chillies.  For $3, it was good but maybe a little smaller than other bahn mis we've had.    The noodle soup was flavourful with chunks of crab paste floating in a savoury broth full of chewy noodles.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try other soups for sure."}
{"text":"Tucked deep within the depths of sky city plaza at midland and finch. Banh mi 24 is a hidden gem for fresh banh mi. By far the best combination for their banh mi. I usually only get their house special banh mi 24. Their bread does not break my teeth like many of the other places. And the addition of onions in their banh mi add another layer to my unfamiliar banh Mi tongue palette. At $3 a banh mi; I always buy an extra bun for emergency meals and immediate consumption   4/5 would banh mi again"}
{"text":"Vermicelli bowl, sandwiches, soups and springs rolls. I have tried everything here and it has always tasted authentic, fresh and delicious. My personal favourite viet spot, and IMO one of the best in the GTA"}
{"text":"great little shop, great prices  yes there is new management but the old owner is still in the kitchen, great bun rieu, pho is good, and the banh mi is there specialty.  the 2 new ladies in the front are slow, but hopefully they will get the hang of it."}
{"text":"Noticed some very good reviews for Banh Mi 24 so decided to stop by to see how it is.  Not a lot of great great banh mi places in the area compared to the west end of the city as my go to place is generally Nguyen Hoang, but after today I have a new one to visit frequently!  Located deep in a newer plaza, Banh Mi 24 is a small store that serves banh mi, rice and vermicelli dishes, desserts and other Vietnamese specialities.  This review is for the banh mi.   Price wise they range from $3-$5 so a little higher then most places but they give you way more in quality and taste.  I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi which was outstanding.  You are given a choice if you want your bread toasted or untoasted... um...no brainer for me...toasted of course!!!  Tons of tender soft flavourful grilled chicken along with pickled carrots, pate and mayo that goes so well with the soft toasted bread.  Most bread at banh mi places tend to be hard to chew but here they are soft and tender.  Its going to be very hard to go back to untoasted bread from now on:)  Its a little longer as they make each order individually but it is so worth it.  Some tables to sit down on so you can eat your banh mi while its still warm.  Will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. A business that keeps their prices low when everything is is going higher should be supported with loyal customers. $3 for cold cut but i give them $4 anyways. $6 for their pho. I especially like their crab paste soup. It's a good portion for $6. Good food great prices! I usually just pay more to support them."}
{"text":"The $3.00 bang mi is of good value, the bun is of good quality, meat ratio is generous. The curry chicken noodle soup is also very good."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but I only tried the cold cut banh mi so I'll wait until I've tried the other ones! $3 for the cold cut and $5 for other types like pork and chicken.   It was freshly made on site and everything about it was DELICIOUS. I didn't end up eating it that day and instead had it for lunch the next day and it was divine. The meat was more than what you usually get at t&t and the veges were on point. The bread was fresh and didn't have that hard stale crunch that you usually get in prepackaged Banh mi.   They take only cash BUT no taxes! So it was a good deal, especially as there aren't that many Banh mi places around here. The only other one I know about it on middlefield and steeles. This one is closer to home and hits all the right spots for me.  You have got to try it!"}
{"text":"Was around the area and was craving a quick bite so I checked out Yelp.   Location is in the far back along the right of the plaza. Inside looks literally like a convenience store as described below. Super small place with one guy running it. He seems friendly too.   I ordered the $3 cold cut. No tax whoop whoop! The menu is a lot more extensive and expensive than Nguyen Hong. It was not bad. Their counter space was very organized and I watched him make it and toast the bun.   Maybe I'll come back to try their other buns."}
{"text":"This is a family business and one of the best places to grab yourself a nice fresh banh mi in the GTA. Delicious, affordable, and great customer service. The owner is a great man, and knows a lot about his passion for the business, and the amount of care he puts out for customers needs. This shop not only sells Vietnamese sandwiches, but they also make delicious Vietnamese coffees, fruit smoothies, and even noodle soups! On the side, they also sell convenient store goods, such as candy, drinks, and cigarettes.  I would easily recommend anyone to come try Banh Mi 24."}
{"text":"This is more an update of my previous experience at Banh Mi 24 http://www.yelp.ca/biz/banh-mi-24-inc-toronto. The store never moved but since the original listing the address was messed up so when another listing was added, Yelp HQ thinks that the business had moved....  The menu is more extensive than the last time I visited than just 1 type of banh mi. The staff a lot more friendly as I was greeted and served by a nice couple instead of a teenager. I was even asked if I want my bun toasted!   Cold Cut ($3) was much better this time. Maybe it was not the end of the day, the bread still quite fresh.   I might come back to try their Grilled Chicken ($5) Banh Mi. And of course extra Thai chili and Jalapeno please!"}
{"text":"Decided to come and try their hot food since i saw fellow yelpers reviewing.  I took several pictures.  I was surprised to see that they also sell cigarettes and random items.    anyways.. some pros of this place is that the soup came out bubbling hot.  bad part is.. i think it was clearly a soupbase from powder or bouillon and definitely not made from scratch and hours of boiling soup.   i was left thirsty as hell... but its not bad tasting by any means.  This is a very small shop that may only fit 4-5 people.  good for take outs."}
{"text":"Small family owned place, nothing but good stuff to say about this place.  The soup noodles were wonderful, the banh mi for once I see the baguette that isn't super hard.  The dude making the sandwiches is always friendly."}
