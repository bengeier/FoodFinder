{"text":"Horrible!!! the only thing that was good was the slice of Texas toast..everything else was dog food..the Mac and cheese had no flavor at all,the rib tips was one giant piece of meat that I'm assuming was rib,the yams was dried out so bad that I couldn't cut them with a knife,the spaghetti was runny,it was just a bad experience all around,the guy waiter was cool but he was by himself so nothing came out fast..I always say you never know until you try it..never again will I try this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Soul Food. Hospitality extradonaire.  A must for all you Military and civilian folk."}
{"text":"The worst excuse for a Southern Restaurant I have ever encountered in my life........ DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans and the wasthe best homemade gumbo I've had in Las Vegas.  I heard the fried catfish is delicious.  As for the crab boil....crab was very small.  I will not order that again.  I will go here again and get the gumbo and try the catfish for myself."}
{"text":"Don't do it. Just don't. Tiny crabs, looked like sand crabs, or maybe and STD left unchecked way to long. My fingers hurt from trying to eat them. My tummy is rumbling... we'll just have to see how tomorrow goes, but I may be ill. Dry, dry cake. It's all just like pieces of a bad dream. Just use your better judgment and never eat here. No matter how drunk you are.  If you can't resist a good time of awful overpriced food, head over to the Seigal Suites and give yourself a little punishment. If you really hate yourself, order the crab.  Hey, it was an experience, that's for sure. Even though I would not classify the service as good, the waitress was a very nice person. (Is that what you say right before you break up with someone?) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off...we walked 20 min in the sun to get here...walked in to a non-smiling Filipina & apparently unhappy with her life chic! She tells us to have a seat. After 15 min and a slow restaurant time....we get our water to the table. No silverware or etc. Then another 15 min goes by. She comes back...still miserable looking to take the order. We wait another 15 min. The food comes...still got my friend order wrong. The food was decent...then I asked her why she was mad....she says I'm not mad...I'm just hot. I'm like...you think you hot \"in my mind\"....I just walked 20 mins to get here in the freaking sun! In the end...I was pissed...no tip and I usually give a tip to everyone...I just don't think she really gave a dam...so I won't either! Done...."}
{"text":"The food is great and the cook is sweet as can be. You can't get any closer to a home cooked meal then this place.  The restaurant is clean and the decor of southern feeling.   I have went there twice on two random times (lunch and dinner)and both times the food was on point. The customer service was outstanding. My husband and could have went anywhere for dinner last night for our anniversary and we choose this place.  You will not be disappointed you will get the best southern home cooking, clean environment, 5 star customer sevice with good prices you can't bet. Ask for the fried catfish, and the is  gumbo ridiculous!!!!! Oh and the sweet tea is the REAL sweet tea."}
{"text":"Although location could be a bit shaky. The food and service is great! Pork Chops is perfect! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Just got some food from this restaurant and you can tell that they do not have the same cook because the food was not that good at all it uses to be very good but not anymore."}
{"text":"the customer service here sucks! we ordered our food at 12:05am and it's now 12:57am!!! guess what; still no food!!!  i will never come back here!"}
{"text":"$40 Min for delivery?!! That's high for ANY restaurant. I really wanted to order delivery but unfortunately, I don't need $40 worth of food..."}
