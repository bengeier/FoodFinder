{"text":"This was the most absolute worst fast food experience I have ever experienced!!  We walked in 20 minutes to closing time with our children. We go to order and some hot head manager walks up to us and says \"your leaving with your food, right? Because we close in 20 minutes...\" I was snooty and came back with a smart ass comment saying \"oh no - we'll most definitely be taking our three kids and their food to eat in our truck, because who doesn't love feeding 3 children in their vehicle instead of at a table and chairs!\" Hot heads response was \"oh, okay good!\" We sat down, then waited for 20 minutes (which was then closing time) they walked up with our food in a  to-go bag, and basically pushed us out the door. Absolutely disgusted! As far as I'm concerned, you serve food until 10pm, and stay until customers are done with their food and left - then you go home.  Our food was cold. We didn't get forks for our poutines, there was next to no gravy as well.  Pop was flat, we asked for only cheese and ketchup on the kids' burgers, and got nothing at all but a burger patty... Will never ever return or recommend!!  **Angry Mom**"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for cappuccino Skor Blizzards. Sure, every DQ has them but I like this location because they are fast, friendly and are pretty good as customer service goes. They always ask if you want lids or not, trays etc instead of just assuming. The hot food, while standard junk food fare, is always fresh and well made.  I also recently bought an ice cream cake here. You have the option of ordering ahead or picking one out of their case (the website indicates either choice is just as safe). This is the only area I would say they slip a little. I didn't order ahead and when I came to choosing one from the case, the pictures painted on the cake were a little odd. There were about 5 with a picture of beer and remote controls (hello...Fathers day is over 2 months away!), 5 with golfers, 2 with flowers, two with butterflies and one with a monkey. As I was shopping for a 10 year old boy, I was kind of limited. Monkey it was."}
{"text":"Today I went to this store not expecting much. My girlfriend just broke up with me and I needed some pick me upper. I thought ice cream is a great idea. I walked in this store and i was blown away by the aesthetics. The store looked incredibly modern and swanky. Customer Service was awesome. Food is alright. Employees looked alright too. 6/10 would bang. Food choices is incredible."}
