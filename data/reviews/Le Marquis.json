{"text":"My husband and I visited Montreal in November for my birthday and he ordered a gluten free/dairy free chocolate mousse cake from Le Marquis. We both agreed that this was one of THE BEST cakes we've ever had (yes, this includes cakes in the Non-GF/dairy free category as well). The cake was beautifully designed as well and reasonably priced. The staff was super friendly too and very helpful. I would highly recommend this bakery to anyone staying in Montreal. Your mouth will have a hard time believing that gluten free/dairy free cake could taste so heavenly...let's just say, \"we told you so.\""}
{"text":"We were so excited to find you. Our seven year old was in heaven! She got a buchette and a chocolate croissant. I loved the croissants-the real deal!"}
{"text":"Normally I am not a person that posts reviews but this is by far the best gluten free bakery I have ever been to and I have been to the \"best\" in NY and TX and this by far surpasses it. It is so good I am still waiting to get sick because I don't know how gluten free could be so good. Can't wait to go back tomorrow morning! :)
My best advice is to bring lots of cash as they do not take American debit cards or did not when I went a few years back!"}
{"text":"This place is an all GLUTEN FREE bakery that includes bread. Like REAL bread! Baguettes, light and fluffy multigrain bread for sandwiches, bagels... All gluten free! They also have sweets such as eclaires, muffins, palmiers, cookies, pastries, oh and croissants. I was so happy to find this place, I cried tears of joy. It's something most people take for granted, eating bread. Oh and it's delicious too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best gluten free bakery I've been to. 100% worth the uber, the price, and the calories!! Got to try some croissant, muffin, madeline, tart, eclaire, cake, and pie--everything was delicious. Not sure if it gets any better than this place.."}
{"text":"I have been diagnosed gluten intolerant over 5 years ago and as a real foodie it's been really hard. I am always on a quest to find replacements for life's guilty pleasures that are now almost always out of reach... Until now fellow yelpers, this place is a real GEM! I am from miami have gotten to the best bakeries in NYC and LA and I do know a \"good\" gluten free dessert BUT this place really exceeded ALL of my expectations. From the friendliness of the staff and the warmth of the passionate owner Nizan available to offer great advice and knowledge on his products. I can state that this man does not cut corners when it comes to quality ingredients and you can taste it in every bite. Forget cheap potato starch and high sugars which are found in most gf items... At Le Marquis we are talking lentil, sorghum and brown rice flours only to mention a few. We got a wide selection of goodies (because hello when do you actually find places like these that are 100% gluten free and half dairy free?!?) and here is my feedback: My cake selection was the opera, double chocolate, praline and blueberry. All had that moist and light texture that you would expect from these cakes regularly and we're not too sweet. The eclairs and \"chouquettes\" were by far some of my favorites because that dough was like a real eclair. Literally. Heaven. I also had some of the pecan and lemon pies which were also the perfect texture. I keep on mentioning texture because I am sure gluten intolerant people appreciate that its the trickiest part to achieve in a good baked product you actually want to eat! I have to give this place five stars because I loved everything I tried. They also offer croissants, breads, muffins and some items to satisfy your salty tooth like pizza and chicken stuffed pastries. I am going to have to go back to get and taste more of his items. And don't be fooled people this place always sells out very quickly! I was there at noon and no more mille feuille's already..."}
{"text":"You probably won't find a better gluten free patisserie, they do croissants, eclairs, you name it, all gluten free and many milk free as well. The breads are pretty good too but the pastries are the reason to come. Definitely a good stop for wheat sensitive people."}
{"text":"This was the highlight of my trip to Montreal and that says a lot because I love this city!!  If you're Glutenfree or not...the pastries are amazing. I have celiac and I own a gluten free bakery in my own city and I was extremely impressed with the flakiness of the croissants and the texture and taste of the pastries! My favorite was the almond croissant!"}
{"text":"I bought a chocolate pear cake topped with pears. It was delicious. Probably the best gluten free dessert I have tasted in mtl. 
Only downside, bough the cake at 1pm for an 8pm dinner and at 9:30pm it was still frozen. The pears inside were chunks of ice. The chocolate filling was delightful. For a 30$ small cake it should have been fresh and not frozen."}
{"text":"I have never been here but my boyfriend who is very thoughtful stops to get GF deserts here for me. They are great even if you don't have issues with gluten."}
{"text":"I can't believe Montreal has multiple places to get gluten free croissants and pastries and New York / LOS Angeles still Does NOT have any gluten free croissant and real pastries! Can you please open in nyc!!! Please!!!! 

I have to come all the way to Montreal to get eclairs and croissant (it's what I miss the most being celiac)! 
How is the USA not catching on and Montreal a place where gluten free was hardly ever heard of 10yrs ago and is now booming!!!


This place is amazing!  Also has dairy free options. In my opinion I prefer dairy even tho I'm intolerant to it... I
A little on the oily side for me that watches fat intake... 
but overall, they have everything bread, bagels,muffins, chocolate croissant... the sizes are really good too.
Glad that I found this one today! So my top 2bakeries in Montreal are baked to go and this one! 

Good job guys! Pls come to nyc!!!"}
{"text":"I seek out gluten free treats in every city I visit. This was my first time at a completely gluten free bakery that made fresh croissants, baguettes, opera cakes and more. The croissant was delicious as was the blueberry tart: the chocolate muffin not so much. They had a great assortment of quiches and other prepared foods that I didn't get to try but I'll be back in a few months and will definitely make a stop again."}
{"text":"We popped in here for pastries our first monring in Montreal.   It smelled WONDERFUL.   We had yet to get any real Canadian cash so all we had was a bunch of coins given to us from friends who had been to Canada and weren't returning any time soon and credit, but this is cash only place.  The gentlemen behind the counter was very patient with us and worked with us and our broken French and his broken English to understand what we could afford with our coins.   We wound up with an apple turnover and a strawberry apple pastry.   The latter was best but they were both amazing.   Apple turnovers are my mom's favorite so I've had many growing up and this was the best one I've ever had.  Worth a stop for sure.

Side note:  We later discovered the is am ATM on this same street just a block or two (walking away from St-Denis) on the left.  I forgot to go back for to-go crossiants, and I regret that now.

They also have meat and cheese, but we did not buy any."}
{"text":"Gluten free bakery. No bad feelings with indulging. I had the pecan tart & half an eclair. My husband had the chocolate rocher and the other half of the eclair. Heaven. It's not chalky, or gritty, the tart crust was heavy but so rich. You guys need to ship to the states!"}
{"text":"What!?  THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

Everything is gluten free and tastes like the real Parisian thing.  All kinds of French classic baked goods.  Lots of it is lactose free.  Baked to perfection!

As a celiac, I am proud to have Le Marquis in the city.  My only regret is that I hadn't heard about it sooner."}
{"text":"I had a taste of about 4 or 5 different items from this gluten-free bakery.  Everything was delicious.  A white chocolate and nut covered cakey pastry, a baguette, potato chips, a chocolate cake, and some other pastry I don't remember.  The desserts were amazing.  Tasted like a normal fantastic dessert.  The chips were... well... chips.  And the baguette was pretty good, but not like normal bread.  It almost seemed  gritty.  But for gluten-free, it was good enough.
I'd happily go back and get whatever pastries tickled my fancy."}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal and are gluten free. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND COME HERE! Hey have an amazing lunch special and great staff. Not super expensive like
some  gluten-free bakeries in Montreal."}
{"text":"Well, I hate to give away the secret, but this place is indeed excellent.  

My girlfriend is gluten intolerant (genuinely so; she swells up like a balloon if she has just a tiny bit), and thankfully enough this bakery nearby has the best looking and tasting gluten-free desserts I've ever tried. 

They also make nearly identical Gluten-Free / Dairy-Free desserts, but I haven't tried these.

Their gluten-free bread is decent, but it is in the desserts that they really excel. 

The owners are quite nice, and are happy to talk at length about their ingredients and cooking processes, or just in general."}
{"text":"So kind and helpful and friendly!  Amazing gluten free pastries! Glad it wasn't too good to be true, it was perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious, gluten free pastries, cakes, bread, and unbelievably: chocolate croissants! They also have quiches and sandwiches and a selection of beverages. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Mmm Nous sommes alles le premier matin en Montreal pour manger un petit chose. Il ya beaucoup de croissants, strudels et pains a choisir. 

Je suis d'accord avec Dawn, le turnover framboise etait le meilleur. 

Aaaannnnnd enough of my broken French. It smelled lovely inside and out, and I loved that you can get fresh pastries, breads and meats. The turnovers really were amazing.

Bring cash!"}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous. an absolute paradise for folks who avoid gluten. They have two pastry cases: one is gluten-free/dairy-free, and the other is gluten-free.  Then they have baguettes, bagels, sliced bread.  And THEN they have prepared foods: sandwiches, pizzas, quiches, cold salads.  Oh and as a bonus, they have some grocery items -- all certified gluten-free.  Are you craving an eclair? mille-feuille? chocolate mousse cake? key lime pie??  they have every pastry a \"normal\" french bakery would have.  

TIP: Go early in the day! Things often sell out - especially the croissants.  ESPECIALLY on weekends.  

The staff tends to be very francophone, but they're so nice and very patient with people whose french is lacking/nonexistent."}
{"text":"Cute little place. I had brunch here with the family and we didn't wait long before being seated. We had to split the group into 4 and 2 because they didn't have a table for 6. No problem though. Unfortunately for me all the pastries were made with butter. I ordered the club sandwich and was pleasantly surprised that they made their own mayo (so I was able to eat it.) I made sure to check several times with our waitress and server that the food was dairy free."}
{"text":"Gluten free bakery from HEAVEN! Now I'm not actually 100% gluten intolerant but I do enjoy baked goods of all varieties and every now and then I do a cleanse or give my body a break from all sorts of things. Before it became a gluten free bakery (a few years back) I used to enjoy the little fluffy on the inside crispy on the outside Portuguese rolls they sold for .40 a piece amongst other delights. With a new schmantzy French bakery a few doors over and my lessening of gluten/baked goods intake I walked past Le Marquis many a time without popping in to see their new line of goods.

WELL I'm VERY VERY happy that I went in today on a whim. They have a brilliant selection of finely made gluten free baked goods. The baker gave me a sample of the quinoa bread that was absolutely perfect (and recommended by a woman in front of me who was stocking up on almond madeleines, quinoa bread and other GF sundries). The bread contains: Organic quinoa flour, organic flax flour, egg white, a touch of molasses, apple vinegar and a few other ingredients and is absolutely fluffy on the inside with a crispy brown crust on the outside. It may look dense and ultra hippy but I assure you with a little butter, compote or what-have-you = bliss. At $6.95 / loaf (they also have sunflower bread, cranberry bread and millet) it doesn't come \"cheap\" but is well worth it as it would be difficult to replicate this at home.

As I was reeling over the bread sample, the baker fetched me a little sliver of melt-in-your-mouth GF dark chocolate brownie (focus on chocolate - not overly sweet) that was also perfect. At $3.95 it seemed a little steep for a brownie but after sampling it worth every penny. 

I highly recommend this understated bakery and shop (they carry a line of Gogo Quinoa products amongst many others). They have truly honed their recipes and anyone who only eats GF or wants to try something different should head to Le Marquis.

**I just removed a star from my review due to the inconsistency of the chocolate brownie. I have been back 3 times since my initial visit to buy said brownie and they either didn't make any that day or had 'blondies' to sell instead. 

But it was a great way to discover the gluen-fueled Parisian bakery next door..."}
{"text":"If you don't eat wheat or gluten you must come check this place out. 
I am wheat intolerant, and love French pastries. Got the most amazing almond puff pastry item well I was here recently. It was still warm from the oven. 

If you used to love puff pastry and have missed it for ages I would highly recommend coming here and ordering anything that is fresh. :)"}
{"text":"Wowie!  Croissants, eclairs, baguettes, and everything else you might want!  I loved this place and had such trouble deciding what to get.  Quite possibly the best GF croissant I've ever had.  Makes me want to move to Montreal!"}
