{"text":"1 of the best in Newmarket. Fresh + lots of toppings"}
{"text":"It's a sad day when you think about the best pizza in town and remember they have closed.
Dearly missed thanks for the great food and great conversations."}
{"text":"Last night in anticipation of an event I was throwing, I agonized about where to order pizza from for my party in the Newmarket area. I scrolled through Yelp and even Google but as Newmarket is still growing on Yelp in terms of review content I ended up rolling the dice and going with Naples. 

I phoned them up earlier in the afternoon and asked to place and order for delivery for around 7pm. The gentleman I spoke with on the phone (whom I assume was the owner) was very friendly and had great telephone mannerisms (hard to describe but you know what I'm talking about when someone is not just taking orders but is also helpful and friendly). 

After consulting with the man about his types and sizes of pizza and how many guests I was having we agreed on 6 extra larges (each starting at around $16 for plain cheese and sauce). I upped the toppings on 5/6 pies and had two pepperoni and bacon, two deluxe and one vegetarian ordered. 

In total my bill came out to $140 and change, extremely reasonable for hosting a pizza party for
36 adults. 

How was the pizza? Wow. I was amazed. The toppings were fresh, the sauce had a lovely slight sweetness to it that didn't stand out but mixed in well. The crust was excellent and I'm
Not sure how it was cooked but it had a crispy crust on it which made each bite as good as the last. Even later in the evening when most pizza gets cold and soggy this 'za held up. 

I probably ate more than I should have, but I dare you to order a pizza from Naples and not do the same. Probably the reason they've been in business in Newmarket for over 40 years. 

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Naples is hands down my favourite pizza in Newmarket. It's fresh, the sauce is terrific, you never get that conglomerate feeling that they are stiffing you on the cheese and it's been family run for almost 40 years. You pay a couple of extra dollars to get real Italians make you a kick ass pizza, but if you have taste buds you'll forgive the price for the quality. Slices are as reasonable as the major chains and FRESH."}
{"text":"Great home-made Italian Pizza! The pricing is reasonable and the pizza is delicious. The place is small so you are better off to pick-up but everything is prepared openly before your eyes.

You can order other items but I only had the pizza. It was fresh and delicious. They weren't stingy on the cheese and the sauce was like Nonna makes- not overly spiced and just right.

I would go back!"}
{"text":"After all the reviews I thought I'd give it a try, I drove over and it looks like they are out of business.  It's too bad when independent places close as they usually have the best food."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Newmarket. Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! The staff are very welcoming, the ingredients are fresh and the taste is incomparable.  Although a tad pricey, the pizza is well worth the money. If you order,  order an hour in advance. With such a small operation doing so much volume, I recommend you order an hour ahead of the time you want to eat. 
Manja!"}
