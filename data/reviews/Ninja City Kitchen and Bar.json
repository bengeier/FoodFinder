{"text":"Had the Bacon Avocado burger and sweet potato fries, was pretty good no complaints. Will visit again"}
{"text":"The food is good, but a little too pricey for what it is. They seem to try to be bringing the NYC vibe to this restaurant, but with the NYC prices. I've had the bento box with the Tom Yum Soup, Sweet Potato Tempura Fries, Gyoza Dumplings, and Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla. I've also had the Spring Roll Noodle Bowl which was disappointing but the sauce that came with it was tasty."}
{"text":"Limited yet well-chosen draft beer selection -- pairs well with the cuisine. Excellent pan-Asian food and great service from friendly servers. Competitively priced. Conversation-friendly.  We'll return."}
{"text":"I wish I enjoyed Ninja City as much as I enjoy Bac in Tremont.  Nope. Not even close. 

A week and a half ago, I was sick.  Like, sleeping 16 hours a day, weakness, dizzy,  fever, aches, rivers of snot etc.   When I feel that rotten, all I want is spicy soup, specifically Bac's tom yum. I was literally dreaming of it by my 2nd sick day. 

I remembered his new joint is on the East Side, so I found up the menu online and there it was, the tom yum of awesomeness.  And turns out they delivered to my address. Yay!!   Since I had no quick food in the house/wasn't up to cooking, I got a few things, hoping that it would last til I could attempt a grocery store trip.  

I ordered the $9.95 bento with tempura sweet potato fries, tom yum soup and shrimp gouda quesadilla, the tofu bahn mi sandwich and another tom yum soup.  It was 2:41pm (the call is still in my phone.)

By 3:28, I called back, since there was no delivery and  no call from the driver.  The girl told me they were super busy and he's on his way.  I got a call 5 minutes later, But no driver. He said he was there, but turns out at the wrong address. I didn't get my food til 3:45, an hour after ordering. 

The shrimp quesadilla was HALF of a 6\" round.  Picture slightly bigger than a cd folded in half then cut into 2 tiny quarters, I should have taken a pic.  The soup was a tiny 8oz container.  Are you kidding me??  The menu says \"little bites.\"  How about call it what it is: microscopic bites.  Nano bites.  Fuck you give me your money bites. 

The only thing worth it was the bahn mi, $8.95, but it was not as good as Bac's.  The bread was dry, maybe a sauce was missing.  Or maybe it sucked because everything was stone cold by the time it arrived.  I should have called and complained, but instead went back to bed and passed out for like 3 more days. 

I would have given 1.5 stars if I could because the soup was delicious. But the crappy service, lack of value in the meal, cold food and sub-par execution overall is why I went with 1 star.  Soooo disappointing.  

Take the trip across town to Bac in Tremont, especially during happy hour.  Sorrynotsorry, Ninja City.  I really expected better from you."}
{"text":"Quite an enjoyable eating experience. I love the urban edge and the graffiti all over the place. If you want some good Asian fusion for a decent price...this is the place. The guacamole bacon burger with the egg is something to contend with. I haven't found something bad on the menu yet and I don't think I will. I also enjoy their drink names, they add a sort of flair to the menu. A great resturant with great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent/reasonably priced food. Phenomenally cool space. Personable/knowledgable staff. Fast/attentive service...

Been here multiple times & tried a number of dishes. Both; recommendations from the bartender or owner, & some ordered on a whim based off menu descriptions. 

Either way, completely satisfied every time. Seriously good food

Favorites so far...
BAHN MI CLUB (rivals chinatown's best!)
CHILI GARLIC WINGS (no joke, may actually be the best wings I've eaten)"}
{"text":"I had ramen for dinner, my friends had pho.
All of them are delicious!
Definitely five star!

The half cooked fried eggs are awesome !

It's no doubt I'll come again!"}
{"text":"Got lunch delivered, so I can't speak to the ambiance.  The green papaya salad was super-tasty and the shrimp quesadilla was as well.  The best part was that there was something for everyone in our workplace order."}
{"text":"Maybe I am to blame for getting the pork buns and spring rolls instead of the main attraction (ramen) but this was about the level of mall food court food, for double the price.  
Also, the buns were brought out first, then the rolls.  That might sound picky, but I don't want the app before the main course.  I wish I could say I'll give it another try, but it was so underwhelming I don't want to blow my cash where there are much better places nearby."}
{"text":"I always like this place but today shrimp tacos make me disappointed, it is very vey salty wontons :("}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I waited at the bar for 20 mins to end up just leaving. So much for customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Had a great time dining at Ninja City. Had the Bacon avocado Burger with sweet potato tempura fries and chili ketchup. It was dank. Had the chili garlic wings as well. Dankness again. Sabrina my waitress was awesome too. Great vibes, great food, and awesome service. I will return and recommend to all."}
{"text":"Avoid!!

Came in based on good reviews on Saturday, October 7th around 3 pm.  No one greeting customers at the door (although a sign planted at entrance says 'please wait to be seated'), no bartender behind the bar,  no waitress to be found on either of two floors. After significant wait finally ventured upstairs  -  to the back kitchen to find some service.  Told to just sit anywhere.  Husband went to the one and only bathroom... found vomit in sink!!  Bartender, who finally appeared but was getting ready to leave, simply rolled her eyes and did nothing when informed. Except to continue chatting up 2 hipsters at the bar.  Imagine the cleanliness of the back of the house! We gathered our family and left immediately.  This was our first visit to Cleveland and up until that point had a wonderful time  - definitely find food elsewhere, there are many great eateries in town."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  Bacon and Egg Ramen is probably one of the best things I've eaten in forever.  Bacon Guac was also incredibly flavorful without being too salty.

This place is going to do great in University Circle."}
{"text":"As a CWRU ug and then a grad student over the years I witnessed the change around our campus. With many new places opening I have to say that this place does not live up to the expectations. I do like the 'fresh' interior, but food is far from acceptable. Honestly, you would be better off getting your 'Asian fix' at chopstick and then grabbing a drink somewhere else. Bac please don't stalk me on facebook."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in the neighborhood.  The staff is great, good happy hour, the drinks are strong, terrific rotating beer selection,   Good DJs on the weekend.  I think the soup is particularly good as well.  I try to go whenever I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"When I heard this place was opening up (the thought of Japanese and Chinese food made by a Vietnamese person), I couldn't wait! ...Now I wish I never went :( The bento box concept was nice but the food, not so much. The pork belly ramen came out bland and the noodles were barely edible. The spring roll wasn't bad unless you like biting into a bunch of grease. The server also had an attitude when I asked for the check. Overall it was a terrible experience. Save your money and go to your local Chinese fast food take-out or McDonald's. This place is very overpriced. It is probably why this place was named Ninja City... to try and hide the bad cooking and service. I also heard the owner was quite the expletive keyboard warrior and that his rants can be found all over the internet. I won't be Bac!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times since their opening mid-August and I really can't complain about the food. It's flavorful and I've enjoyed every bite. Granted that their ramen isn't as authentic as I'd like it to be but like one reviewer said, this is Cleveland and it's definitely better than what is currently being offered around town.

The reason for the 4 stars is their service (though the servers are all really nice). They just opened so I'm giving them time to iron out their kinks but I hope to God they smooth it out soon. I went to lunch with a friend today and after we were seated, it took the server 30 minutes to come back to us to get our orders. We had to flag her down repeatedly before she finally saw us and I could tell that she had forgotten that she had a table waiting for their orders to be taken.  

So by all means, make your way down to the restaurant. the food really is good but if you come during the busy times, be prepared to wait. I hope you figure out your service dilemma, ninja kitchen, because you have a good thing going there."}
{"text":"Great drinks. The bacon and egg ramen was a bit odd with spaghetti instead of ramen noodles (is this typical?) and the egg was overcooked, but the broth was nice."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat! 

I live about 10 miles away and I'd happily drive farther for this type of attentive service and unique cuisine. I'm working my way through the menu with the guidance of the service staff and enjoying their recommendations. 

Wu-Tang and Marvel vs. Capcom? It's like they are in my head when they picked the aesthetic. It's fun with an edge that's perfect for someone from my generation. Late night hours mean I have someplace to get actual fresh food after 10pm. 

I'll be coming back and bringing more people."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. We went on Friday night and got seated right away. I got the bento box and BBQ pork steamed buns. It was delicious. Our server recommended the dumplings which I'm glad I listened to the suggestion. The spring rolls were also a winner!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place, not out of its awesomeness but more due to its proximity and late hours.

The most striking feature of this joint is that their service is very consistently poor. I'd say I've dined at least 10 times sitting down, and did take out twice. In all occasions, I'd rather have been in a McDonalds, since there you at least know that you can stand in line and be served in due time.

Speaking to the foods that I have tried, the banh mi probably had spam in it (or some other cheap alternative) and lacked cilantro/jalapeno/anything. Even superior pho banh mi tastes better.

Burger is actually well priced, and I consider it the best cost/performance item on the menu (then again, how do you even screw up a burger? all you need to do is use fresh ingredients)

Bacon ramen has decent pork and surprisingly non-mutilated kimchi, but the broth is an odd mix of miso and pork, somehow off-putting. The fried egg isn't mutilated either, but the noodles are not the ramen noodles I am used to, with a very wheaty texture. Honestly I wouldn't mind the ramen if the noodles were normal ramen noodles, and I did ask them to use the rice noodles once. The rice noodles came out broken (how are they boiling these noodles?) and I don't remember the experience being any better. Even disregarding the noodle texture, which could be pretty subjective, I have seen my noodles come out broken multiple times, and the last time I had the ramen it was not cooked throughout, not even an al dente, just straight up uncooked. Since I wasn't there for the noodles anyways and mainly just wanted a hot broth, I didn't send it back and just ate it since the noodles were at least cooked to a pliable, edible degree. I am very dubious as to who is preparing the noodles for the ramen (and probably the pho as well) given my multiple counts of broken noodles and one count of completely undercooked noodles.

For the small bites, I believe I've tried the sweet potato fries, rangoon and gyoza.
They are all just so-so, decent in pricing and performance. I would rate the fries over the rangoon over the gyoza."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the rangoons. Super friendly staff. Can't wait to come back. Good beer selection v"}
{"text":"It's about time we had a place like this!!! Super flippen awesome. I am slightly angry that the owner has not franchised Ninja City yet, because 15 min away from my house is too far away. Whoever the owner is should get a Nobel Prize!!! A true hero. Beer + noodles = amazing."}
{"text":"Good place for some quick Asian-American food. 
Their Pho is pretty good- portions are pretty big, and comes with sauces+veggies to put into the pho.

They have a bar for drinks- nice place to just chill and drink at night when you want a somewhat quiet place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time tonight, will definitely try to make it again! Good prices, great food. I got a little bites bento box. The Wonton Chips are fantastic. OMG. The Chili wings were amazing. I've had some of the other apps during the Night Market events and thought they were really good as well. Great service too. Our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow!  There have been so many improvements at Case and University Circle since I graduated a few years back: among them, Ninja City!  With high expectations, I went there for a late lunch on a Friday, and I was not let down.  The service was very friendly and quick (though they weren't busy).  The vibe of the restaurant is really cool and unique, and you can get your Street Fighter arcade fix. 

Based off of the bartender's recommendations, I ordered the Tom Yum Soup ($3) and the Steak & Egg Rice Bowl ($9).  I honestly never knew Tom Yum Soup could taste that good- I was blown away.  If you like a little heat, definitely go for it.  The Steak & Egg Rice Bowl was also great.  The steak was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and tender.  The ginger soy sauce was an awesome dip. The kim chi, seaweed, and scallions were perfect compliments to the dish.  And of course, adding a fried egg to anything only makes it way better!

The portions were very generous, and the items were fairly priced.  I have two wishes: that it existed when I was a student, and that the food stays this tasty (or more) when I return- please don't let me down!"}
{"text":"Let's start with saying that I wanted Ninja City to be good and was very excited to try it out.  I work in the area and walk by the restaurant daily. I went there with my GF.  Service was really poor.  Once sat we were not acknowledged for 15 minutes. Appetizers (various fired items) were cold to the touch when served to us after waiting for 45 minutes. The main dish was cold, bland and not entirely fresh. 

We complained and our server brought the owner to our table.  He was quite rude,  basically told us we didn't know what we were talking about.  The man told us we were just unlucky, as we came in at the tail end of their rush. Hence we got the cold food left over from what was fired prior to said rush. The audacity!  After significant attitude he took our dishes back to be re-done. They came back within 2 minutes, appeared to be microwaved. When he asked if it was alright I told him the truth... The man than became intimidating and hostile, he actually told me to go cook my own dish in his kitchen. I was utterly shocked to say the least.  We  had to ask him to leave our table.

I have never been treated this way in a restaurant  in CLE, or anywhere else in the States or abroad. I WILL NEVER GO BACK there, and tell others to do the same. There are several great places to eat in CLE, this is not one. As I said earlier I work in the area and eat lunch in local restaurants daily. I was hopeful that Ninja City could be a new place to frequent."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bacon and egg ramen and pho are amazing. Great beer selection and great atmosphere. They have a catfish fish and chips special right now I'm totally obsessed with. Must try !"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon avocado burger with no bun and I got a hockey puck with a cold craft single on it.

Sent it back and got shredded lettuce and onion on top and a tablespoon of guac on the side.

The waitress was really nice about it but I'm probably never going back.

Tl:dr
Worst burger I've ever had for $10.
No bacon to be heard of."}
{"text":"So after posting that I was gonna try it Harris from yelp told me they removed my posting and would remove subsequent postings even though all I said was that I was gonna try the place.  

Well here's my review I honestly thought the food was well above average no mind you I don't eat this type of food everyday but the hype lead me here.  I rather enjoyed the noodles and the service in my opinion was very good.  No I am a good looking white dude so I mean there's that..... So turning to my asian wife I asked her opinion and she said yes honey you are attractive and this food is actually pretty good.  So there you have it Harris we went and enjoyed the place quite a bit I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars but the problem I face is that- to me- this place is Bac's identical twin in the food realm. Now don't get me wrong, I love Bac and the food they offer but I was hoping for at least a little bit of a different variety at Ninja City. 

Other than my own thoughts about the food options, I think the restaurant is a perfect addition to Uptown and it has a great vibe. The service was tentative and well knowledged about the beer/sake/drinks the restaurant serves."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago. 

Although my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant, service took way too long. 
My biggest complaint, however, is that I specifically asked the server if there was any pork meat in the items that I ordered (i.e. spring rolls). Because he said no, I went ahead and ordered it. But when I bit into it, there was definitely pork. The wings were also pretty awful. Would not recommend ordering either items. 

p.s. the place smells like the SUBWAY restaurant next door. Def takes away from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The place has a cool vibe to it - walking in, it looks like a modern bar, but the back has additional seating with lots of interesting art. The staff was nice and attentive, and the pricing was maybe a bit higher than expected but still within reasonable range. The steamed bbq pork buns had a lot of veggies that ended up overpowering the meat, and the club banh mi sandwich hardly had any meat to it. Overall, my expectations for the food were not met, but it is a nicer bar for the college scene."}
{"text":"We've been back to Ninja City multiple times now, for both dinner and lunch.

Everything continues to be consistently good.  The owners and waitstaff are friendly and efficient, the food is always good, the atmosphere is funky and urban without being intrusive.  

In short, Ninja City is a perfect gem that pulls of exactly what it aims to be: a fresh place to go for really good Asian street food at great prices.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"The noodle salad is seriously absolutely amazing. Sure, the service can sometimes be slow, but come here for one of the best lunches in UC (also perfect takeout option)!"}
{"text":"Sticking to my 3 stars, but I wanted to update because the lunch I recently had has them cruising for a 4. 

My husband and I came back for dinner recently and were again met with some horrible service. We were ignored at the bar for quite awhile before we got to put orders in. This was clearly not because of a rush of business or anything. The servers and bartenders were lolly-gagging. When we got our drinks, we were met with a frown - I can understand bad days at work, hell, I think we all can, but this evening really brought me down. What made it worse was the massive glop of sour cream that overwhelmed my nachos. I like sour cream, but this literally made me gag.

I came back for lunch with a friend recently and we had some delicious drinks as well as food and service! WOW! Like a whole new place! The server was friendly and nice - he even smiled! The beef pho is probably the only reason to come here if you ask me, though. Everything else I've had is OK, but this is amazing. 

So...I guess lunch time is the only way to get good service here and the beef pho is the only dish to get in my opinion. The limitations suck, but when you do manage to hit the jackpot in this gamble, it's great!"}
{"text":"I am SO glad that I discovered Ninja City at the Cleveland Night Market this July where they had a booth. I tried the Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla, and WOW, I was so happy to find that it actually has a nice kick to it, perfectly complimented by the sweetness of the mango salsa! This yummy \"little bite\" has become a food addiction for me lol that I literally crave. 

Since then, I have visited Ninja City in Uptown many times, both weeknights and on weekend nights, and I have always been impressed with the excellent drinks, delicious food, and the friendly attentive staff -- particularly the great bartenders who always make sure that you have cold water as well as your beverages. Ninja City owner, Dylan, exudes a very appealing natural charm as he smoothly makes his rounds through the house, warmly greeting guests and personally making sure that everyone's needs are met; Dylan always makes you feel like a VIP and he's so glad that you came. It's no surprise that Ninja City has attracted many regular patrons, including me!

Ninja City's industrial/super-hero theme decor is genius, and the whole vibe is hip, casual, fun and always very welcoming! Also worth mentioning, the spacious ladies room is especially nice with its cool graffiti wall and full length mirror; it is always immaculately clean, too. And if you are still playing Pokemon Go, Ninja City is a pokestop!

I usually order from the Little Bites menu -- in addition to the above mentioned quesadilla, I also recommend the Shrimp Buns (spicy!), Garlic Wings, Spring Rolls, and Sweet Potato Tempura Fries. On my most recent visit, I tried the Korean Rice Bowl - beautiful presentation and the flavor combination was spot on; it contained a very generous amount of tender, perfectly seasoned beef and some of the best kimchi I've had. I'm an omnivore, but if you are vegan or vegetarian (like my sister), no worries, they have that covered. When you come for dinner, try to save room for dessert -- the Fried Icecream with fruit and whipped cream is truly to die for. If you just want to drink and chill, I highly recommend their weekend events (Fresh Friday, Uptown Saturday Nights) when they feature sick DJs spinning hip-hop all night.

Clearly, Ninja City is a unique and well-managed venue with a superior attention to detail that makes it a destination location. For so many reasons, Ninja City has quickly become a favorite place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Dual-family meal here before a recent Cavs watch party, unfortunately not very impressed with my meal at all.  Service was fine, music was chill, beer was cheap, but the food left a lot to be desired.

I ordered a bento-style box with four items...tom yom soup, bacon guacamole, chili garlic wings and the spicy shrimp quesadilla.  Although the presentation was fine, the flavors just about all missed the mark.  First of all, they brought me the wrong soup.  Instead of the tom yom I was expecting, they brought me miso which was all spice and broth with nothing else.  The bacon guacamole was served with crispy wonton chips.  The chips were crispy and good, but the bacon guac has very little (if any) bacon flavor and the guac itself was rather tasteless.  I did enjoy the chili garlic wings.  The two small pieces of spicy shrimp quesadilla were burned on the outside and tasted mostly of spice, not shrimp.

Others at the table enjoyed their meals, especially my daughter who ordered the ramen burger which looks to be cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Other than that, I have to say I was disappointed in my meal."}
{"text":"Food takes a bit, it's worth the wait. Good exotic selection of beer, not so crowded for a college campus area bar and locals here are chill, too. Call ahead of time for dine-in order if you don't have much time. Bartenders are nice!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place... Stopped in with some friends after parade the circle because it was nearby. Beautifully decorated, clever ordering process, (you check off boxes next to what you want on pre printed menu cards), friendly staff, tasty food and and large portions. 

Took off a star because this is THE smallest restaurant that wasn't strictly takeout I've seen in my entire life. The bar area was large but the dining room area is quite overcrowded and has more tables than it should IMO. I was seated near the hallway to the restrooms/kitchen and I wished I could scoot my chair in more every time a patron or staff member passed me."}
{"text":"I'd been to Ninja City a couple times before and wanted to go back but this last trip tested that.

It was a Friday night around 8p, very quiet, maybe half-filled to capacity. The service we got would have indicated a full house. We waited, waited for a table. No refills. Took forever to get our food (which was actually quite good). The server knew some customers a few tables over and took plenty of time to hang with them. 

The menu is a fill-out card similar to Happy Dog or Barrio, which I guess makes sense for those heavy-customization menus. Not so much at Ninja City -- it is an attempt at being hip while really being an operational shortcut. Well even that could not save the truly poor service we received. 

Great atmosphere, great food, but unacceptable service. I don't know if the carry-out business that I've noticed them promoting has overwhelmed the kitchen or what."}
{"text":"Asian fusion in the worst sense. I ordered a few small plates, since the prices were cheaper than even basic takeout. The Tom Yum soup was one of the biggest mistakes I can recall in recent dining experiences. It was a consistent sour oil slick that caused heartburn after consumption. The egg rolls were grease sponges that I felt compelled to eat, hoping this roughage could clear my throat. Even with a bill of around $7, save your money and buy P.F. Chang's frozen food for a better meal. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Their noodle soups (ramen, pho) are delicious, and their dessert was wonderful.

I frequent Uptown quite a bit, and so I've been seeing this place on my way to Uptown ever since it opened. Since there was the Fire and Ice event in Uptown last night, my wife and I decided to finally give Ninja City a try. I had the bacon and egg ramen with the chili garlic wings as a side, and my wife got the ginger beef pho bowl (on the specials menu) with the sweet potato tempura fries. The fries were pretty good (the chili ketchup sauce was amazing), the wings were pretty good, and the pho was very good, with the nice kick of the ginger and the beef cooked just right.

But the highlight was definitely the bacon and egg ramen. As a Japanese person, I absolutely love ramen, and often get cravings for real Tokyo ramen. While I've gone to NoodleCat several times, each time I've been disappointed (though that's a review for another time). So I walked into Ninja City with pretty low expectations, to be honest. However, their ramen was excellent, and definitely a real ramen dish. The broth was clearly a fusion version of a traditional broth, but the noodles were very near the real deal, which is the first time I've ever thought that in the Midwest (including Chicago). Definitely going back for that.

The fried ice cream was delicious, too. My wife thought it basically tasted like a freshly fried twinkie, and that's about the highest praise we can give it.

Decor was bar-style (like Happy Dog), and there was no music playing when we went in, so noise was fine."}
{"text":"Even though I only ordered take out, I want to write a review because I think this place has some pretty harsh criticism.  I ordered my meal online, easy peasy, no real point reviewing that.  When I walked in I was greeted immediatly and politely.  I waited 2 min for the bartender to finsh with her customers and then was helped right away.  I was left with the impression that had I sat at the bar I would have had a nice experience.

On to the food.  Bacon and egg ramen, wow the broth is awesome.  Perfect combo of flavors.  The egg was cooked perfectly even though I walked the food back to the office.  Pork belly is fatty, thats the point.  I did not care for the uncrisp consistancy of pork fat but I knew this was going to be the situation so after some careful removal of fat from meat I had some real tasty bites in my soup with all the flavor of the belly.  I do have to agree with the other diners that the \"ramen\" noodles are basically spagetti.  But they were tender at least and not overcooked.

Papya salad was delish, and the reviews are spot on with the spring rolls.  It looked a little on the well done side, which frankly is how I like them.  Also, kudos on packaging.  Do not be afraid to order to go and then get a mashed up version of what you would have had sitting down.

Great job!"}
{"text":"Perfect price point for what you get. Really like the \"big bites,\" especially the bacon ramen. The draft selections are usually wonderful as well, but be prepared to be flexible if you're a hop head."}
{"text":"I've been in Ninja City twice for drinks and not-so-delicious snacks. In fact, Dylan and Bac were both there to greet me, since Bac and I are Case alum (and Dylan briefly attended).

My first visit was during a Cleveland trip in August. I had the ramen soup, which I found to be sub-par (borderline mediocre). The ramen elsewhere in the country puts this to shame, but you might not know that if you've been in Cleveland all your life. Broth was pretty weak and noodles were meh.

Second visit was for drinks. I brought a wedding party in for a round of shots on the way to photos. Bartender definitely watered down the drinks."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to come to ninja city for a while now. By the time I made it there, their kitchen was only serving items on the after hours menu, unfortunately... But if any of those do any justice to the full menu I am sold. I ordered a burger (I know, very original right?) and it came with an egg on top, fresh avocados and fries with the store's proprietary sauce. And I was Blown.Away. I am coming back cause Bac's naiiiiiled it"}
{"text":"This place is as advertised. A great feel with friendly staff and very reasonable prices. We were there for happy hour with signature cocktails going for $5 (normally $7). These would be $12-15 easy out in SoCal.

I had the bacon and egg ramen and my wife had the veggie. We also had an array of appetizers. Some great (Bacon Guac) and some average (wings) and some just not my thing (a special \"thanksgiving\" eggroll with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry - my wife thought they were yummy, though)."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Ninja City. The first time I went was a few months ago and the food was fantastic. I came back yesterday expecting the same and I was slightly disappointed. Main difference: Broth. Something is different from the time I came before. I noticed it in the bacon & egg ramen (my favorite) and also noticed it in the chicken ramen. It was lacking the flavor it had before. I don't know if they make the broth again in between lunch and dinner (we were there around 5) but it was definitely different. Maybe it needed to sit more or perhaps it was just a lighter batch but it was different. The ramen noodles were proper noodles and the texture was perfect (again). My friend had the steak and egg rice bowl and he was very happy with it. 
We ordered the bento box (tempura fries, dumplings, and rangoons). The fries and dumplings were good but the rangoons were a tad cold inside. I'm assuming they are refrigerated after they are made and then placed in the fryer but it could have used a few more minutes to get the inside a touch warmer. 
Overall, I still love the concept, the portions, and the service at Ninja City. I do want to give it another shot though. It just seems different from the last time I was there so I'm hoping it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Good idea in concept however somewhat stingy with their meat provision. Beef and chicken rice bowls have slowly started to decrease in portion. Good friendly service though."}
{"text":"Great food prices! Completely different from the norm. I would suggest this place for a quick lunch or a group dinner. It's Asian fusion with a twist. 7/10 ranking it's slightly above avg. would try it again :)"}
{"text":"Went on opening night and the food and service were great. I ordered the Bacon and Egg Ramen, and the BBQ pork steam buns. The ramen was fantastic, and I am already looking forward to having it again. Noodles were cooked right, and the smoked pork belly was excellent. The bbq pork steam buns were good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were super pumped to try out Ninja City for lunch today.  We enjoy restaurants with similar idea concepts and were excited to see the atmosphere.  We entered a very packed restaurant and sat down to fill out our order forms.  We were excited by the items on the menu and eagerly filled out our menu choices.  The waiter greeted us and asked us if we had any questions.  

We then submitted our order forms. We sat and waited for our food for 45 minutes. The waiter did not stop to ask if we needed anything else to drink.  He did not reassure us that our food would be out shortly.  We all started to get a little restless since we have an hour break and have been waiting 45 minutes.  

The waiter then brought 3 out of the 4 plates of food we ordered, and none of the appetizers (or \"small bites\") that we had ordered. It took another few minutes for the last bowl of food to come out and we reminded him of the appetizers we ordered.  He went to check on them. He did not apologize to us for forgetting our appetizers. Some of the food dishes were also forgetting parts of the meal (rice with no chicken, vegetables missing) He then brought out the appetizers one at a time while most of the main dishes were half eaten.  Not once did the server apologize or offer to take off one of the appetizers. 

All in all my rating for service would be a 0 out of 10. 
 
The food we received was cold and bland.  It did not seem fresh. All four of the bowls were missing at least one item we marked off on our order forms.  2 of the 4 people I attended the restaurant with had a stomach ache immediately after they finished eating.  

The service and the lack of freshness of the food led me to give Ninja City a well deserved 1 star out of 5. I will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"So, looking for something that combines tempura and spice? Something that gives you great drinks and creative snacks? Some place that, after a long jog to the Cleveland Museum of Art or a stopover at CWRU, will serve your taste buds with a smile? 

Well, welcome...to Ninja City. 

The places atmosphere is a bit urban steel meets comic book kitsch, with a little tasty distraction on top. With a menu that does credit to Vietnamese with a tasty twist. Things like shrimp quesadillas, sweet potato tempura fries and my favorite, bacon guacamole with tempura chips compliment each other in bento-style serving trays. They have exotic ramen soups, spring rolls and to top it off, a variety of beers from a variety of countries along with some exotic takes on mixed drinks (they have a full bar,) that will make your palate sing:) Add to that a variety of dipping/seasoning sauces and it makes the symphony of tastes complete. 

Now, there's really no parking, but there is a local garage around the corner on Ford that should accommodate. They also have a great, open bay area out front that lets you sit in the breeze or a cozy spot up and in the back for a meal with that special someone out a great night out. 

The staff was very kind and the service was great. Since they've just opened up, I suspect that the menu is in the nascent stages, so expect more interesting things to come.

So, if you can, stealthily make you way to Ninja City, but please, don't stay quiet about it. Tell everyone you can:)"}
{"text":"I avoided this place for the longest time because I saw bad reviews. I was really hesitant to go but we decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did. We had the bahn mi and bacon and egg ramen. First off, I've had some bad ass ramen before (obvi not in Cleveland) and I would say this is a solid ramen - not the best I've had but way better than I expected. The broth was flavorful and rich. The bahn mi was a great portion with good bread (super important) and the meat was decent. We also had the chili wings which were pretty good. 

Prices were reasonable and service was good. I don't understand why people are comparing this place to noodle cat (which I think has terrible ramen). They surpassed every dish I've had at noodle cat in one bowl of ramen. 

I wish I would have tried it earlier."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see this place when it first opened. The University Circle area has been drawing a lot of established names from the Cleveland culinary scene (Crop Kitchen, Corner Alley, Happy Dog, Mitchell's, ABC Tavern). Those other establishments have been living up to the reputation of their older siblings and I was expecting Ninja City to deliver the same level of quality and tasty-ness as Bac, in a more social atmosphere. Unfortunately, I was let down. The food didn't deliver on flavor or quality. It's really too bad because there's obviously a lot of potential. I for one was ready to become a regular--until I tried the food. At least the beer selection was unexpectedly interesting; I guess I should have been expecting that given what a beer town Cleveland is! Also not sure how I feel about the music...Maybe tone it down just a little bit in terms of both aggressiveness and volume. The atmosphere wouldn't suffer any and the patrons would probably be happier."}
{"text":"Amazing addition to the Cleveland area! My friends and I went on a whim on a Saturday afternoon and just wanted some quick eats! Much to our surprise the place was packed- we sat at the bar and experienced great and quick service even though they were busy! We all three had the Bacon & Egg Ramen and it was AWESOME! Lots of flavor, huge portion and super tasty! Friendly menu and super affordable! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Fiance and I came here for lunch while walking back from Case Western to our hotel since it was on the way back. We were hoping for something light because we were planning on having sushi later that day. 

It seems like your typical bar downstairs, but they have some seating arrangements upstairs. Ambiance was super casual, but it was also really loud because the music echos throughout the place. The ordering system was a bit confusing because instead of a menu and placing your order with the server, you mark down what you want with pencils that are provided to you (as you would do in some sushi joints), and hand the papers over to the server when he comes by with your drinks. Otherwise, not much explanation.

Fiance got a bento box with Tom Yum Soup, the Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla, and the Bacon Guacamole. I got to try his Tom Yum Soup; he wasn't too fond of it because it was more sour (?) than than what he normally associates with Tom Yum Soup. He was expecting spice, not sour. I suspect it was too much lime in the lime broth. He said he enjoyed the Shrimp Quesadilla, but that the guacamole wasn't anything special. I got a bento box with the Pork Rangoons, Chili Garlic Wings, and the Shrimp Quesadilla. To me, the shrimp quesadilla was fine (mostly cheese, less shrimp). The Pork Rangoons were delightfully crunchy and stuffed full of pork, and the dipping sauce helped with the heaviness. Probably my favorite thing so far. I was a bit disappointed with the Chili Garlic Wings, because the description on the menu says it's crispy and jumbo, but I thought they were pretty typical and not so crispy. The way it was described, it seemed as if it would have the Korean fried chicken feel, but it definitely wasn't. Actually, that being said, none of the food really felt authentically Asian. Maybe that's their concept, but I wasn't feeling it.

That being said, prices were pretty reasonable. However, one disappointing aspect was that our food took quite a while. Maybe it was because it was after the lunch rush, but there was only one other party of four upstairs with us and we both waited quite a while for our food.

tl;dr average food, somewhat of a wait for service. Bento box lets you try multiple things on the menu. Favorite was the Pork Rangoon."}
{"text":"My friends and I made this place our stop for a monthly restaurant outing. Overall our experience was very good. The waitress was friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. We all ordered a main dish and small bento boxes. I have to say the small area were the best. I loved the spicy shrimp quesadillas. I had the Vietnamese noodle bowl with beef and while it was good, the flavor was a little lacking. One of my friends had the same comment on her dish. As we were waking out, two employees thanked us for coming and said \"come back again.\" We will!"}
{"text":"We were here on opening day, so I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt. But any other day I'd say this place had some work to do.

PROS
There are plenty of vegetarian options, although they weren't anything spectacular. The tofu banh mi had way too much bread and way too little tofu. The decor is cool, although it needs more ninja artwork throughout. A few paintings isn't enough.  The vibe is young and fun. The Ninja City logo is very cool. Some seats are outdoors overlooking the avenue, which is fun.

CONS
We waited about 10 minutes before anyone came over to even say hello.  The checkoff menu is confusing; we had to ask our server several questions about how exactly to order before we actually placed our order.  The main seating area, up a few stairs, is very cramped.  Actually, the whole place feels too small. I feel this is a big idea restaurant squeezed into a tiny space.

I wish the place well, but it needs a little work -- and a little more room -- to become a really fun restaurant I'd return to."}
{"text":"Everything I expected, good service and excellent food, I went 
there because of the reviews I saw else where, It is to bad Yelp has become a site for bashing restaurants and business because someone can't get there way like spoiled kids. Don't change a thing, we will be back."}
{"text":"My gf and I really liked Ninja City all three times that we have visited. Friendly staff, delicious and reasonably priced food, all within a very fun atmosphere. Ninja City is a great place for a casual date. The atmosphere is an oddly fascinating mix of hip-hop, indie rock music, and art with a \"hipster\" Asian theme...think of the television shows Boondocks and Black Dynamite. It is one of the few places to enjoy hip-hop music without the often undesirable crowd that can attract it. They also have a live D.J. set friday and saturday nights. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to try their steam buns which I found to be much better than Noodlecat's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Ninja City albeit they just missed the mark. The \"Taco Tuesday\" was bland and it was due to the corn tortilla. The flavors in the taco didn't match and it got cold way too fast. I MUST SAY THE COCKTAILS WERE AMAZING!! If the could tweak a few menu items this place would be the best ever."}
{"text":"I thought their ramen was pretty solid - I liked it better than the late night noodle menu at Dante.  I went with my gf who had the bacon and egg one, while I had the chicken.  The broth in the bacon ramen was much tastier, and had these nice, big, and delicious cuts of pork belly. This led to many stolen bites while she wasn't looking.  I would definitely come back again. 

Also had the papaya salad, which was refreshing and perfectly seasoned. The spring rolls were fine - not much to say about those.

We did not order drinks this time, but their specialty cocktails looked awesome. They had some unique combinations, many of which included ginger.  That usually makes for a nice clean-tasting drink.  I may come back and raise em a star after I have a chance to try a couple.

I also really liked the atmosphere and industrial theme design. It definitely has a modern feel, and was intimate without being crowded.

Ramen snobs (esp. from the coasts) probably wouldn't like the ramen - but hey, for Cleveland it's pretty good!

I sort of feel bad writing about this, it's going to come off as completely douchey. But . . . the square bowls. I have no idea why, but eating ramen from a square bowl is disconcerting. Yes, I realize this is hyper-nitpicky. And no, it won't stop me from coming back.  It just felt wrong for some reason.  I will say that I'm not a ramen aficionado, so if other people tell me that square bowls are generally acceptable I will withdraw this paragraph and diligently practice my square bowl handles."}
{"text":"I had a Korean bowl and the sauce was ahhhh mazingggg; it helped add flavor to the rice and chicken. There was also kimchi, and a lot of it so as a person who does not waste food; I ate all of it. Besides overdosing on all the kimchi, it was pretty good. As for the interior design, let's just say wow; did not see that coming. The service is decent, but the food was coming slowly (maybe I came on a bad night), but for sure I will be returning!

I've returned! Gave the Korean bowl (steak) a second chance and made sure to let them know to add only a little. I split it with my sister along with three chicken steamed buns. Soooo good. This time around was a better experience for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Ninja City for the first time last night. Was a little nervous after hearing conflicting reviews. The atmosphere was a little strange; blasting hip hop music might be appropriate in a crowded bar but there were only 4 patrons in the place so it felt awkward and out of place. The decor is also very loud.

The food though was pretty good and hit the spot. The bacon guacamole was awesome. Will likely be back for the food, would be interested to see if the atmosphere is a little more chill and less in your face at lunch."}
{"text":"Asian food tapas style.

We came here on a Saturday night and the place wasn't crowded at all. I think it's the Saturday after Christmas. Our party of 8 got the back room all to ourselves. I like the variety of food - Thai, Japanese, Thai. A little of something for everyone. Since I wasn't very hungry, I decided to get Tom Yum soup from their Little Bites menu and a BBQ pork banh mi sandwich from their Big Bites menu. That banh mi sandwhich was huge! I could only eat half of it and took the rest home. The Tom Yum soup was just okay. Based on everyone's orders, the ramen looked delicious. Also I like how they had bento boxes for different varieties - 1) 3 items from the Little Bites menu and 2) 4 items from the Little Bites menu. Just in case if you don't want to get a full meal.

Definitely had a fun time with my family here!"}
{"text":"The menu is somewhat small, but the food was great!  Very vegetarian and gluten free friendly, which was awesome.  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"TL:DR version

-Ramen is good, but expect a surprising fusion of flavors there. Maybe some prep issues that will sort out over time.
-Small bites were the highlight: shrimp quesadilla, Tom Yum soup, gyoza.
-Beer selection is excellent: they have local stuff (Jackie O's IPA was great), as well as Hitachino Nest (notoriously hard to find, get it while it lasts)
-Cocktails are great too: 17th parallel is light, refreshing, and a really well-executed drink.

All I can hope is that they keep doing what they're doing, and keep things fresh and interesting here in University Circle.

--

Having only been open for a few days now, my girlfriend and I figured we'd stop by Ninja City for some late night eats and drinks. Right when you walk in, the place is clean, attractively furnished, and pleasant to be in. The front window opens wide, bringing a nice breeze into the place, perfect to cool off the sweat you might work up trying one of the fusion ramen noodles they have. The staff is pleasant, attentive, and eager to make a good impression (exactly what you would expect from a brand new place).

On the ramen: it's obviously not your instant, deep-fried Cup-Top-Nissen stuff. But then again, neither is it a hyper-traditional Japanese ramen. The Tonkotsu ramen uses a wheat noodle (maybe less familiar to some than the more elastick-ey egg noodle), and combines a cured pork belly (reminiscent of a Canadian bacon) with Korean kimchi (spicy pickled lettuce, think fiery sauerkraut). The result is something that is good to eat, but also a new experience even for seasoned ramen aficionados. The one comment I have is that the noodles had a bit too much of a flour/dough flavor, and tended to take away slightly from the rest of the dish. Hopefully that is just an issue with preparation that will be ironed out over time.

What really moved me to give this place five stars were: 1) the little bites, 2) the beer selections, and 3) the cocktails. Each of the little bites we ordered were prepared perfectly, even for such small portions. The gyoza were crispy and full-flavored, without the thick dumpling skin that usually plagues most Asian-fusion restaurants. The edamame was salted just right, and cooked just on the right side of light preparation. The Tom Yum was the biggest surprise, as despite the slightly unappetizing appearance (black bowls are maybe not the best presentation for a clear soup), had an intense, spicy, sour flavor that worked perfectly with the fresh Thai basil and sliced white mushrooms. The shrimp quesadilla was an irreverent combination of a fried shrimp tortilla with a delicious sweet salsa/aioli dipping sauce.

The beer selection was thoughtfully done, with a nice variety of tall boys, local crafts (I mean unique beers actually from Ohio, not the usual Great Lakes that you can find nearly anywhere in the country), and three Hitachino Nest beers from Japan to complete the Asian feel. Hitachino White and Red are excellent examples of wheat and amber ales, respectively, and are typically quite hard to find, so kudos to Ninja City for getting the sourcing right.

The craft cocktails seem well put together as well. The \"17th parallel\" is a crisp, refreshing cucumber drink perfect as an apertif or to start the night. The other options were getting rave reviews from the others sitting by us, but I had indulged too much in the beer and food, so that's as far as we went. All I can say is, the wedding party that insisted on vodka on the rocks, jack and coke, and Jameson shots probably missed out on a major part of what makes Ninja City great.

All in all, this is a great addition to the University Circle area, a real Asian-fusion place that will get you great eats, beer, and cocktails, so long as you go in with an open mind ready to try something new."}
{"text":"I been a fan of ninja for a while. Food is great. They are still getting their groove but it still a worthy restaurant. In all ninja city is a solid place to eat."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the Korean rice bowl and pork rangoons. Everything was great and at a good price."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order today at 12:40pm and waited for 40 minutes before the bartender told me they had forgotten to put in my order so I left. Can't speak to the food but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place several times and have always meant to make it inside since I've heard good things. Firstly, I'm in love with their Spring Rolls! Super crispy, but not greasy! I'm not really a spring rolls fan normally (clearly I've only been eating sub-par spring rolls) but I was impressed by these! The Crab Rangoons were also delightfully crispy! I honestly haven't decided if I'm a fan of the Tom Yum Soup yet. I ate it, but I think it might have been a little sweet for my palate. It did make some great food-lube while I was eating the crunchy, fried food! 

I also got the Bacon & Egg Ramen because, why the hell not! The take out portion of the ramen is huge! The broth tasted like a mix of miso and kim chi, and that is a good thing! The thin-spaghetti noodles that came with it kinda made me laugh, and I didn't really mind that they weren't \"normal\" because they actually stood up pretty well to being microwaved later. I would encourage more kim chi in the ramen, and at first I was a little afraid of the texture of the pork belly since I've only ever had it fried before this and I was worried it might get a little mushy (you know where things just kind of disintegrate in your mouth, weird). But it tasted really good and was a nice contrast to the crunchy kim chi!

Also, they have free delivery and online ordering; dangerous information!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fine, there are cool cartoons on the walls. Poor service from the one waiter who was working on a Saturday afternoon. We were waiting for him to walk by so we could ask for the check, and he was just standing at the bar watching tv. The ramen I ordered was extremely bland and flavorless. It said the broth was miso, but it hardly tasted like anything. Instant ramen tastes better than this. My friend got the chicken rice bowl and said it lacked flavor and was dry. All that aside, I know several people who tried the Pho there who enjoyed it, and I've heard good things about their happy hour."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of times with my friends and we just went for some drinks for the first time to catch up and listen to some tunes since one of my friends are friends with the DJ. I did get a chance to order food this past weekend and had their Korean rice bowl. I chose brown rice with steak and egg. It's not that bad and the price is affordable. They do offer a vegan option (tofu) which is nice to know for those who are health conscious. 

The wait staff are nice so there are no complaints here and the bar staff lets you try a sample of draft beer which is nice of them to make sure you like it before you order. 

this place is a bit far away from where I live so if I venture out this way, I'll have to try their ramen."}
{"text":"The place is cramped up in a little shop next to Subway on Euclid. Park in the Uptown lot or the lot next to Chopstick/behind Starbucks, or even next to Triangle Apartments and walk over to this place that has some pretty cool pictures hanging around. When you enter you first hit the bar, but head on to the back and you'll be seated promptly and served their menu. Food is actually good, but too overpriced for my college budget. Glad I was able to cross it off of my Uptown bucketlist!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a bite to eat in the area and settled at Ninja City. I knew the reviews were mixed but decided to proceed anyways. 
The service was nonexistent at 8:30 PM and the restaurant only had a few patrons. We barely got checked on by our waitress throughout the meal and it took a while for us to even be greater by our waitress.  
I found the food to be lack luster. It has all the potential of being great. I ordered the steam buns: pork, pulled pork and chicken. The pork was my favorite but the buns came ice cold- as if they were never cooked to begin and just thawed. I also ordered two small bites. The gyzo dumplings and guacamole. The guacamole was basically just plain avocado and I could not taste any of the bacon is supposably was suppose to go with. They also really rationed out the wonton chips. I only received four to begin with and when I asked for more my waitress only gave me three. My dumplings were so oily. It was such a shame too because the inside was really tasty. 
I would not attend Ninja City again and would strongly recommend others to look elsewhere. If we had just received poor service OR poor food then I would try this place again but with the combo of both I have no intention of returning."}
{"text":"The menu sounded good, but the food didn't deliver. The chicken ramen was flavorless and lacked any seasoning; even adding Sriracha couldn't help this pitiful attempt at ramen. 

My friend got the bahn mi and could only describe it as \"meh\" it was served on a giant loaf of bread and didn't have enough cilantro or veggies. 

If I return, it will be only for drinks- overall I left Ninja City feeling disappointed and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Went there for a date. The vibe is casual, a very cool spot. 
They were playing Wu Tang Clan. 

While I was initially weary (I'm not the biggest fan of Bac) I decided to give it a chance. 
I got the wings and the spring rolls and both were decent, the wings were the better of the two.
My date got the bahn mi and the sweet potato fries, he liked the sandwich (it was pretty big) but I did not like the fries, they tasted more like grease than anything.
It's definitely a very casual place, I probably wouldn't go there for a date again but would maybe try it again if I had a craving for a noodle bowl or something. 
The food could definitely be better, but it's a decent enough option since there aren't a lot of asian food options in that immediate area."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting food simple as that.  Would not recommend.  The staff is super rude and act like you are inconveniencing them when you eat there.  Place is too small.  There are plenty more similar places around go there.  Don't waste your time here..."}
{"text":"mmmm
it seems like a dicotomy in the reviews.
i've had some delicious food here. the ramen noodles are ok. nothing to brag about. but the sandwiches and buns are delicious. the banh mi sandwiches are literally like the size of my head. next time i'm gonna get it with double tofu and it'll be like the size of an arm. the steamed buns are so good too. the chili aioli is soo good.
now the dance nights, kinda weird. haha somehow we went during one of these dance nights, just to get food, and we witnessed some really awkward dancing. two girls trying to get up on some dude. yuuupp...
i like the food, but actually i like it more as take out so i don't have to sit at this tryin' way to hard to be hip place haha"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time last night. Really impressed! There were three of us and we all ordered different things and they were all delicious. Love the Banh Mi at Superior Pho, and haven't found anything comparable in CLE until last night. While Superior Pho is still my favorite, this one is pretty great. 

Definitely worth a stop when you're in the Univ Circle area. Took a star off because drinks were only so-so and they asked us to move tables for a DJ performance. . ."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of checking out some of the museums on Wade Oval, I was looking forward to an early dinner at this place. It was just after 5PM, so I was hopeful that we'd be avoiding the dinner crowd, but I didn't expect the place the be nearly empty, except for a couple of after-work bar patrons. Nevertheless, was looking forward to sampling the menu. Got the steamed buns and opted to try with chicken, pork, and beef. You get 3 in an order, so I mixed up my proteins. Awesome! Packed with flavor and just plain good! I could've eaten 3 orders of these.

Then I was curious about the bacon and egg ramen. I LOVE pork belly, so I had to try it. The pork belly was awesome, too! I'm not well-versed enough in ramen to criticize the broth. I've read some reviews that their broth is not typical of ramen, but I enjoyed it - no complaints. The only thing that caught me off guard was the noodles. I asked our sever what noodles they used, and he said that they were just typical ramen noodles. The reason I even asked was because the taste, texture and shape was that of angel hair spaghetti. It took away from my ramen experience a bit, but not enough to say it was a negative one. They really did a good job with that pork belly, though! I'll be back to try others on their menu.

UPDATE: tried their Bahn Mi sandwich with pork on a more recent visit on 8/22/15... best Bahn Mi I've ever had!!! The pork was sooo tasty and perfectly cooked and tender - it melted in my mouth. Sandwich was perfectly spiced and balanced with the accompanying ingredients. Someone I went with on this visit said their Pho was surprisingly really good. I'll write another update as soon as I try their pho!"}
{"text":"Tried to get the owner to understand that with only two diners, both of us middle aged, that playing loud gangsta rap for us really wasn't appropriate.  He was very defensive.  

Funny thing is, he stated that this University Circle restaurant is not a place he'd send his Tremont Bac restaurant customers for the same reason - that they wouldn't like the music!  

I took the time to give personal feedback and he didn't even want to give me his name!  That's his version of customer service.  A person who is customer-oriented would never be reluctant to give his or her first name.  

It was a waste of time eating there and trying to get Bac to understand my disappointment.   His aloof attitude was just plain frustrating.

We make a lot of recommendations to family and friends, and as you can see my reviews have been mostly positive.  I would NEVER want family and friends to patronize this restaurant.  Parents of CWRU students, hospital employees and patients, arts institution personnel and guests, etc. - stay away.  You'll be even more stressed eating at Ninja City.  Go to Noodlecat instead."}
{"text":"I had bacon and egg udon. I wasn't sure what to expect but man was it good."}
{"text":"I got the pho here and it was REALLY good. The crew and I went in with low expectations, but I was blown away! To me, it tastes pretty authentic; the broth was flavorful, you are given the typical side of bean sprouts, jalapenos and lime, and they even put rare meat in like they do at Vietnamese places! Overall it was a very, very satisfying meal. 

The atmosphere is great, especially at night when the weather is warm and breezy and you're sitting at a table next to the open window wall. I was here around 10pm on a Saturday when there were not many people in the restaurant. Staff is very friendly and accommodated splitting our checks by order. 

I am definitely coming back here the next time I visit Case Western."}
{"text":"I'm really diggin Uptown these days. My bf and I dined here for Valentine's Day this past weekend and we were quite impressed. We are both semi picky eaters and greatly appreciate the checkbox style menu (a la Barrio).

We shared the spring rolls & edamame \"small bites\" ($3.50) and enjoyed the BBQ pork buns and chicken ramen ($8.95). The food was fresh & imaginative.

Our waiter was attentive and helpful. I really enjoyed the cool comic book decor and music selection.

We will definitely come back to Ninja City!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:
After much thought, I am updating this review.
Shortly after posting yesterday's review, the business owner found me via FB (we are not friends, but we do have a few mutual friends). He messaged me with insults and racial slurs against me and my friends. He went on to accuse me of sabotaging his business due to personal reasons. I have never met the guy. Now I'm singled out by another Yelper by the name of \"teenwolf t.\" by posting my full name and calling me a fraud.

The owner did apologize after I asked for an apology this morning. However, I am not returning to any of his current and future businesses."}
{"text":"I've gone about 5 times, tried things from all over the menu. This place just isn't....isn't good. The food doesn't taste good. The noodles have zero flavor. The miso is no better than store bought. It's just a poor man's Noodle Cat. A very very very poor man.  The beer selection is tiny, so you have to get bottles to get anything good. I gave them more than a fair shot, and after the owner's racist social media meltdown, I shouldn't have gone back, but I gave them a couple more fair chances. This just isn't good food.

Oh, the appetizers, they are pretty good, and come with pretty creative sauces, but they don't bring them out before the main, they bring the main and starters together. So your dreadful main is cold and gross by the time you're done with the starter."}
{"text":"I love visiting places out of town that are unique and can't really get back home. With that being said, the motif is so trendy and cool. I love the music and contemporary atmosphere; definitely a great place to kick back. The food was incredible. I cheated so bad on my diet. They have gluten-free options which were nice. The owner was so down to earth. He came by and chatted us up. The prices were really reasonable, too. Definitely a must-go place when visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"I read some bad reviews here... So my expectation was pretty low going in.  I must say I'm usually not very impressed with Asian food in Cleveland but... I had a wonderful meal.  Bacon & egg ramen was awesome and so was the ban mi.  1.  Portions were huge.  2.  It was delicious.  3.  It was cheap.

So for people who didn't like it before... Come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Really different from any restaurant you've ever been to. Kinda small inside but pretty good food."}
{"text":"The two stars says it all, but I will elaborate further.

Service was good but not great. That's where the good ends. Food was at best, ok. I ordered the Banh Mi ($10) with club for the protein. That may have been my downfall. It had the texture of spam, and I am ok with that. The flavor was just odd. The bun was entirely too big for the sandwich as well. It actually was the majority of the flavor of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a meal and a beer. The service was quick, and the food was tasty. When we walked in it was kind of confusing because it looked like we were walking into Subway."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work so it was an easy choice for when we wanted to try something new. I picked up a bunch of to-go items for us to sample and thus here is the review on our $45 Ninja City feast. 

Pros:
Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla - Enjoyed this with the mango salsa, very tiny portion though, so I don't suggest sharing it. 
Bacon Guacamole - Hard to go wrong with bacon and fried wonton chips. 
Green Papaya Salad - Refreshing, slightly sweet with a crispy crunch. 
Bacon & Egg Ramen -  Enjoyable with a nice flavor. 
BBQ Pork Buns - Very good! Although $9 seems a bit pricey for 3 little buns. 

Cons:
Bacon & Egg Ramen - Threw me off because it looks like spaghetti noodles, also the meat was just way too fatty. We didn't eat it all and the next day you could see the thick white fat coated to the sides of the container. 
Steak & Egg Rice Bowl - The meat was flavorless and chewy. Contained plain white rice and there was an off taste about the kimchi. 
Spring Rolls - Unremarkable. 
Gyoza Dumplings - Unremarkable. 
Pork Rangoons - Unremarkable. 

So this place is half and half, I would check it out again if they made some changes to the menu."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the BBQ pork steamed buns. Sweet with a nice cut of vinegar from the pickled vegetables and slight spice with jalepenos

Didn't love the ramen but I'll try it again next time"}
{"text":"Pretty bad food. Service was so-so, slow, 1 waiter on a busy Saturday lunch time. The food wasn't really what I expected and made our stomachs hurt afterwards."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and ordered the bento box, with one of my 3 choices being Tom Yum Soup, which the menu indicates could be made vegetarian. This was important to me, as I am vegetarian. I asked the server if it would take a while to make it vegetarian and she assured me that it would not. Well, it took them a while to bring out our order. I was enjoying my soup when all of a sudden, to my horror, I saw a big piece of shrimp in the cup. I leapt up from my chair...not only am I vegetarian, but I'm allergic to shrimp! I alerted the server. They brought me a new bowl of soup and another salad, which is a strange move when someone might be about to have a severe allergic reaction. Oh, and they charged me the normal amount. The weird thing is...I had no serious allergic reaction. Usually if I am even near shrimp, I get hives. But I ate about 6 bites from my soup...and nothing happened, except an hour later or so. I started to feel some tightening in my chest. So now I'm thinking it was something that looked like shrimp. What is going on there, Ninja City???  I'm glad I was fine, as I didn't have an Epipen with me...but how can you be serving fake shrimp?"}
{"text":"OK, this place pretty much rocks. Let's talk about happy hour, tall boy beer and a shot five dolla Hollaa. We started with one a piece.  I knew this was going to be a good night. When you ask someone if they want to start off with that and they do not pause, nor look at you funny, well that is my type of person.

Let move on to the bento box, that so happened to come with yet another tall boy. The spring rolls were phenomenal, perfectly hot and crispy with a high protein content. Definitely not weak ; ). The chilli garlic wings were well executed. Crispy with a nice flavor, I will ask for them to be more spicy next time, and not white people spicy, like Mexican spicy.  Lastly the bacon guacamole was pretty tasty, with real chunks of bacon, like not kosher chunks of bacon, not that bacos crap.

Service was super friendly and knowledgeable. They explained the happy hour, the different menu's, and dealt some mighty fine recommendations. Definitely strong."}
{"text":"I think certain items are done well here.  I really enjoyed the vietnamese noodle salad, you add your choice of protein, i added the pork spring roll.  It was fun and unique combination textures with the spring roll, noodles, lettuce and cucumbers as well variety in temperature since the spring roll and noodles were hot.  10$ gets you a creative and filling lunch, nice change from the hospital cafeteria options!  Another bonus is that this place is open late!"}
{"text":"So i've tried this place and it has it pro's and cons overall its not a bad place to come try late night or for a bite/beer.  Nothing amazing but hoping that my review will go up over time!
Pros
- they have some awesome beer selections (ginger beer orange was awesome) but some of the prices are a bit steeper for the normal student
-the bacon guac was bomb!!!!
-steamed buns with shrimp bomb diggity
-server did take time to explain the menu
-Bacon and egg ramen- not bad for Cleveland but the noodles were just so so but still a pro

Cons
-seating was cramped and I kept getting a huge draft from the kitchen-merp
-The sweet potatoe tempura fries pretty lack luster
-spicy shrimp quesadilla too cheesy with not enough flavors
-the service was a bit lax but that might have been because they were busy?
-prices in general are so so- wish some of the serving sizes would have been larger
-decor a bit lack luster- get more awesome art!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Service is always good. Food is always hot and yummy. Great place to hang out with friends.  Its a must try.  The Pho is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick lunch! The service is very quick and the menu is easy to navigate. You fill out a menu card similar to some other places in town (think Happy Dog), which allows you to personalize your order a bit. I ordered the Vietnamese Noodle Salad and it was delicious (see picture)! 

Our server was very helpful with pointing out other things to do in the area and was knowledge about uptown in general, really appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. We really enjoyed the gyoza dumplings. Very comparable to the pork dumplings at PF Chang's which I love. The chicken ramen was good. Not the noodles I was expecting, but still tasty. All the tables were full on a Friday night and they kept playing what seemed to be the same terrible dub step song over and over again which made for a pretty loud environment. Other than that, service was friendly and quick. I'd definitely rather go here than to any standard Asian take out place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the restaurant itself is a little off putting. When you walk in the door there is a poster of rules, I don't know how strictly they are enforced but... \"You order it, you buy it\" - what if I don't like it? And \"we may ask you to leave once you're done with your meal.\" -what if I want to chat with friends or even order a drink. 

ANYWAY... I usually get the Asian BBQ buns and they are delicious, you get 3 for $9 which is a fair price. Also, the panko sweet potato fries are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Got a quick order to go recently. Beef pho and chicken Ramen. They were both great and staff also switched out Ramen noodles for g-free rice noodles no problem.  Pho was comparable to straight vietnamese spots  (Superior Pho and Pho Tang), plus it came with additional raw beef to be cooked fresh in hot broth. 
There was a lot going on with miso broth in chicken Ramen.

Also got an order of veg spring rolls, yum."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order delivery from here regularly. We LOVE it.  I recommend the steam buns and the spicy shrimp nachos. Delivery is always timely and everyone is friendly. This is our go-to restaurant when we aren't up for cooking ourselves."}
{"text":"I got the saltiest, worst miso soup I've ever had here. The main dish had very little meat was way too full of rice. The atmosphere was nice, but that in no way makes up for the pricy, mediocre food and slow service. Plus, these guys threatened other yelp reviewers who spoke their mind about the bad food here. Don't believe the hype, other restaurants are far more deserving your money."}
{"text":"Came here on a visit to cle. Interesting name. Nevertheless we tried the food. Service was eh.  Food was even more eh.  Cle is bumping with new restaurants with quality. Don't settle for eh."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service and reasonably priced.   Love the bacon guacamole    The Vietnamese noodle salad is the bomb.    Yum- mee"}
{"text":"Love the interiors of this place and the choices are really good. I love that you can make your own bento and have a good selection of ramen. I tried the lettuce wrap and it was delicious (a little bit salty) but overall this is a nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"The soups were spot on, the dumplings were very good. The service wasn't worth tipping."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on Monday as we were both playing hooky from work.  We shared the tofu steamed buns which were very tasty.  I had the kimchi rice bowl with tofu which was tasty and the husband had the pork ramen which he loved.  I was here once before and ordered the bahn mi and didn't like it much, but I'm glad we came back.  They have a very good beer list."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, chill music, and great food....what more can you ask for!?!? I had the Vietnamese Noodle Salad with Shrimp (you can choose your own protein).   The serving size was generous that I had enough left over for lunch the next day.  Not a bad deal for $11!"}
{"text":"So I love Bac - it's one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.  And everything at Ninja City was taken for a trial run at Bac first.  The Banh Mi and the sweet potato fries - both taste just like the ones over at Bac, which means they taste terrific and will probably be my go to dishes here.  If the Vietnamese noodle salad is the same as it is at Bac, it's probably good too. 

Now the ramen.  When I first ordered the ramen at Bac, the noodles tasted like they were not fully cooked, and I sent it back.  The waitress commented that I was the third person who sent my ramen back to the kitchen that day.  Here, it's the same - the noodles taste doughy, as if they are not fully cooked.  The broth - it doesn't taste like your traditional ramen broth, but it is okay.  The meat is good.

I also had the steak and egg rice bowl, which I found to be a little plain, but still a decent choice too.

All in all, ramen is sort of meh, but the other dishes are decent enough here at mini-Bac."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent asian food. I've eaten Pho at a lot of places & they really knock it out of the park. The broth is perfect & the beef is the best I've had in Pho soup. My wife loved the Steak & Egg Rice Bowl & our small bites were fantastic as well. We had the spring rolls & Kyoto dumplings.....both were perfectly done! We will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I just find this place to be trying a little TTTTTOOOOOOOOO hard to be  something it  is not...  It is okay little buddy! You're doing pretty good at fooling people at least. I find the menu to be all over the place just desperate to grab your attention and spend your money. Like it is just sceaming , \"Oh pho is really cool so here!\" or \"Look look look ramen!\" or \"Steam buns are getting realllllll popular better sell them!\". 

Typically I love fusion food so I did have high hopes, but will not be returning. Want other alternatives? Noodlecat, Stir Crazy, Umami, or Phusion Cafe.

The order (it was take out by the way, but I did stop in and find the setting very \"cooool\"):
Bento Box 4 Item: sweet potato tempura fries, green papaya salad, spicy shrimp quesadilla, chili garlic wings
Bacon and Egg Ramen
Pork Korean Rice Bowl
Steam Buns: BBQ pork and beef"}
{"text":"After experiencing them at many night markets and beer gardens we were very excited to be trying them at the restaurant.. We sat  down and our friend put a order in right away. For a veggie soup bowl and a couple apps. The food came about 10 minutes later. We ordered the rest of our meals as there were 4 of us there. We ate the apps that were available  and awaited the rest of our food. And we waited some more. About 45 minutes later our food finally arrived. The food was great. Better then the night markets and beer gardens.  The service however lacked tonight. The food will bring us back, The service will make us think twice."}
{"text":"My three friends and I decided to grab lunch at Ninja City on a whim last week. 

The Marvel vs. Capcom arcade game in the corner, industrial bar stools and tear-off menu added to the laid-back atmosphere. The menu is split into \"little bites\" (appetizers) and \"big bites\" (entrees).  

We didn't have any problems with the service (as other reviewers had). The waiter was jovial and answered all of our questions. Our cups never went empty! 

I would have given Ninja City 4 stars if it hadn't been for the gyoza dumplings. These 3 dumplings were the absolute WORST dumplings I have ever had. Greasy, but not in a good way. Flavorless. Shriveled. If a genie gave me three wishes today, one of them would be to untaste those dumplings. 

The Korean rice bowl with chicken is what saved this meal from being an outright disappointment for me. All of the components - from the spicy kimchi to the sliced cucumber - were delicious. 

Am I glad I tried the food here? Sure - Now I can let go of my FOMO. Will I ever come back here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. I got the Bacon and Egg ramen with Pork Rangoon on the side. The service at the bar was good and i received my food in a decent amount of time. Nice chill place overall to have lunch although I'm not sure whether I'd consider them for dinner."}
{"text":"So very good we are back here for a second time since NYE! Great food great atmosphere and great great service. Totally relaxed as totally recommend. Hey you even have this guy making sure you are safe! 

Back here (7/1/16) for a third time and food is always consistent!"}
{"text":"Ninja City has some pretty decent Asian fusion food and great cocktails. So far, I've tried the chicken ramen and the Vietnamese noodle salad. The chicken ramen is tasty and pretty satisfying, especially on cold days, but the noodles are definitely not ramen-like to me. The Vietnamese salad is refreshing and definitely lighter in taste, but also an enjoyable dish overall! I've also come here for happy hour a couple times, and I recommend the lychee mojito if you're looking for a sweet, tasty cocktail :) Their Pimms cocktail is also pretty tasty and refreshing!

I've never had a bad experience with service here. The last time I came, our server was very prompt with taking our orders, refilling our water, and getting us our check. Food orders here are placed on these order forms that you fill out on your own with your name/order that is then taken to the kitchen. When I've come here for happy hour before and sat at the bar, the bartender was also attentive and friendly. Happy hour is 3-6 pm daily, and cocktails are $5 during this time!

Overall, I'm sure I'll be back in the future. The food is not the best, but Ninja City is in a convenient location (close to campus in Uptown), service is great, and there is a solid selection of food and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Blergh. I was really hoping to fall in love with this place after all the great things I've heard about Bac, but unfortunately, my experience was just meh. 

My eating buddy and I started with the sake flight and maybe I just don't like sake, but I was not blown away. They lacked depth and were just not as flavorful and complex as I was expecting. For appetizers, we ordered 3 little bites to make a bento box: sweet potato tempura fries, pork rangoon, and dumplings. These were all fantastic! Seriously, best part of the whole evening. The pork rangoon was crispy, and the meat was juicy and flavorful! And of course, you can't go wrong with anything that has \"sweet potato\" and \"fry\" in its name! 

For entrees, I ordered the bacon and egg ramen. I was drooling when it first came out because the presentation is very attractive...but alas there was no personality behind the face! I thought the broth was oddly flavored, almost like sriracha mixed with water...a little like they gave up with the spices and just watered it down. My eating buddy ordered the steak and egg rice bowl, which I sampled and thought was a little plain. 

Overall, the food was just meh. Nothing to write home about. Although, the ambiance is very relaxed with funky comic strip artwork on the walls and cafeteria style seating. The waitresses are friendly and knowledgeable and the service is overall pretty fast. This one is a solid 3 stars for me!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the atmosphere. Small, intimate, and social. Excellent staff with the owner hanging out and catching up with his friends. In the late hours the volume goes UP to blast your ears out, so be ready for it.  No talking. The cold noodle salad with chicken is quite good.  Fried foods make up most of the menu, but it's Ninja City's creative re-make of popular Asian dishes that really entertain. Note: this is not an upscale restaurant. This is a cozy joint on a college campus that whips up booze and bar food on the spot - and does a damn good job at it. Happy 3rd birthday, Ninja, and best of luck into the next 3."}
{"text":"I have grown to love Ninja City over the past year. Firstly, they participate in restaurant week and despite the food being affordable already their restaurant week prices are a steal! I've had all the cocktails on the menu and I can't think of one drink I did not enjoy. The small plates are shareable and I recommend getting one of each thing and making it into one delicious meal (bento box). The portions are great. When my husband works overnight or isn't feeling well I usually get Ninja City to deliver him ramen or pho to the hospital. This place is so underrated but I live for their happy hour"}
{"text":"I had the misfortune to try some food of theirs at a festival earlier in the semester and I was distinctly disappointed. The spring rolls in particular were very bland and uninteresting. Also the people serving were not friendly, which is odd because many of the reviewers seem to like the service. Given the number of options in uptown now, I don't see any reason to go to this place."}
{"text":"This place charged $7.50 for ice. That's right I said ice! Left a bad taste in my mouth never go back!"}
{"text":"Went and waited over 50 minutes for food when there were only 3 ppl in the restaurant. The waiter never even came over to check up or acknowledge the extreme tardiness of the food. Horrible service and the food was sub par. I'm almost positive they forgot to bring it out as the appetizer came out cold with the entree. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I was very satisfied with what I ordered every time. Bacon and egg ramen is an obvious choice and their pho is surprisingly flavorful as well. The spicy shrimp quesadilla is very tasty too! Their sweet potato tempura fries are actually my favorite. The pairing with the special chilli sauce is perfect! Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood place for consistent food, great atmosphere, good price, good selection of beers and cocktails!  Happy hour menu is very good.  If you are looking for a great vibe and relaxed Asian street food scene this is it in University Circle.  Music is a little chilled hip hop (nothing over the top).  Food is very consistent which is what I'm expecting for with a small menu. Service is very good and everyone is cordial.  Korean Rice bowl with spicy kim chi is my favorite.  Beer selection is very good with a wide variety on the tap and bottles."}
{"text":"This place just sounds interesting to me. For a disclaimer, I only did delivery and the service is pretty fast (you can even track the driver/food online to see where in the process your food is). You do have to order online through \"Skip the Dishes\" and not over phone, but it's pretty simple.

I ordered with a few friends and we shared a lot! We all loved the Pork rangoons and shrimp quesadilla! We had a bit of the sweet potato fries, they were more tempura than potato so felt it pretty oily and more bread crumbs.

We had the Pho and the Banh Mi. The Pho came with a lot of beef which was great, but the broth itself was a little watery. The Pork Banh Mi was delicious and I loved the sauce. Had a little too much bread for my liking, but loved the vegetables on it."}
{"text":"Is there an option for \"0 Stars!!\" The name alone is a joke, really? Ninja City? This place is overly priced, you can get a REAL Bahn Mi in Chinatown for $3.........the staff doesn't even look like they're happy to be there. The food is sloppy and nothing on the menu is really asian flavored. Disappointed in how you represent Vietnamese food in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Great time during my visit in Cleveland at this place. We stumbled onto this business because it was across the street from our hotel. We planned on going in for a quick shot since it was cinco de mayo and ended up staying for hours and ordered food. We met great people and ate delicious food. I ordered the short rib lettuce wraps. Would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Park at the church. 
Floors ridiculously sticky. Loud rap 'music'. Long wait for expensive take-out. Will I go again? Yes, because they have a better/diff menu than the myriad of asian-themed places in the area. ;)"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to taste some Ninja City Cafe steam buns while drinking at Platform Beer Co.  The steam buns were fresh and delicious.  I also tasted their guacamole and chips, which were also tasty.  Finally, I tasted their egg rolls with fish sauce, which was awesome. I can't wait to visit Ninja City's full restaurant and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I love the build-your-bento box menu! I enjoyed checking the boxes to get exactly what I want. This is a great place to go with a group of friends to pick and choose different apps to share. And also a great place to get your own entree.  I went with two others and we shared a little bite be to box with 3 little bites - the bacon guac is out of this world, the spicy shrimp quesadilla was awesome and the gyoza dumplings were perfect. We also shared the order of 3 bbq pork buns and another order of 3 pick-your-meat buns with beef. Both orders of fluffy steam buns were stuffed with meat and toppings!! So great! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Cool! Finally a late night food place to frequent!

I always wondered where Case kids go to eat. I was spoiled with the many places to eat late at night in Ann Arbor, so when I moved to Cleveland. I wondered \"man, where do those kids go?\" Why now to Ninja City of course!

We walked in and got seated around 5:15pm on a Friday night. Not too shabby. You order off of a paper menu (marking off your selections) and the waiter comes and picks up your order. 

We started with the hitachino witbier. I was like \"hitachino!\" , a Japanese beer that is not only hard to find but also tasty.

He ordered the noodle salad. It was alright- nothing special, but decent, with chopped up spring rolls.

I ordered the bacon and egg ramen. Not the most appealing name, but it was actually really good. The broth was excellent, there were pieces of pork belly throughout, and the noodles were good! I mean, they're not the super chewy texture you can expect at a noodlehouse in a big city, but it's definitely noodles (which is real stuff and not that instant stuff)!

Portions are good- we were stuffed. The place was hopping even when we past it later on at night.

If you're looking for a late night noodle place or just somewhere to chill and eat late at night, definitely check out Ninja City! I recommend it (and most definitely the ramen!)"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion never really quite work out right. This is another case in example. Place is nice and hip although the music was blaring and way way way too loud to hear anything. Bf and I went to check out this place Friday night. Tip: park near Constatine Market, there is a lot behind that area that lets you park 1 hr for free or no charge after 6pm daily. On arrival, we were taken to the upstairs portion of the restaurant. Couple tables open including one 4 person seating that was close to the wall so you don't get noise pollution from the other tables. We were seated in between two 4-person table in a 2 seater, one of which was the aforementioned table. The other table sat a couple both of whom were talking really really loud and swearing/cussing etc. Not pleasant. I asked to sit at the other empty table but the waiter refused saying that he was saving it for some other bigger party. Well, 10 min later, another waiter seats a 2-people group in the table I wanted. Sigh. Poor service and attitude. I guess I am picky about tables though, but seating is important to making or breaking a dining experience. Moreso, service was bad as we waited over 30 min to order and another 20 min to get the food. Ramen shouldn't take that long to make, should it?

Food was also not impressive. Ordered 2 pork belly and egg ramen as all the other reviews rave about this dish. Also ordered 1 small dish of pork rangoon and 1 small dish of spicy chili chicken wings. Ramen was sadly unseasoned well. I normally don't eat salty by any means and I was just wishing they could have added a bit more salt. Kimchi in the ramen added flavor but so little kimchi. Pork belly was fine for the most part but one piece I got was very chewy. Other pieces were tender and fatty. Poor consistency - bf got only like 2 slices pork belly and a ton of kimchi in his whereas I had like 5 slices and only a few slivers of kimchi. Noodle is the same white flour noodle you can buy at Park to Shop - I use the same exact kind all the time. Otherwise, pork rangoon was missing the cream cheese that you get in traditional rangoons. There was a tiny subtle flavor of cream cheese that made it uncomfortable to eat - either don't add it at all or add the right amount! Chili wings were bad - tasted like buffalo sauce, bleh. 

Only reason why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that they do the ramen slightly better than Noodlecat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I have a lot of friends that come here on a regular basis. For starters we did have a group of 6 on a Friday night so I know it was probably overwhelming. I will start with the pros. The cocktails were all really good and I thought the atmosphere was very unique. The negatives were that one of my friends menu cards was lost somehow and she never got her food. No big deal because it was fairly crowded and they looked short staffed. I ordered the spring rolls and the Banh-mi. My sandwich was quite literally all bread and very little meat and vegetables. And they brought out dumplings instead of my spring rolls. The waitress went back and realized that the mistake was on their end and put the order in for spring rolls. In the meantime she left the dumplings on the table. I left them at the end thinking she was going to take them back which she never did. So I gave them to my friend that never got her food. When the bill came, they charged me for both. I asked our waitress why I was charged for the dumplings when it was their mistake that they were brought out and she fired back asking why we ate the dumplings. I understand the situation but I shouldn't have gotten charged for something I didn't order in the first place. She did take them off ultimately but I ended up feeling like I had done something wrong which is not fair. Ultimately, I would just come here to have a couple drinks at the bar. And make sure to be clear on your ordering sheet!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, overpriced, and horrendous attitude.  The 5 star reviews are also pretty suspect."}
{"text":"Woohoo, pork belly was so good.  Had it delivered for lunch, no complaints."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as the idea of the restaurant seemed really cool. However, the food was a failure. You'd expect that the food would be better since an asian chef is cooking it. NOT. 

I tried the green papaya salad (hated it), bacon guacamole (eh it was interesting), chili garlic wings (could do without, didn't like the sauce), spring roll noodle bowl (so bland. this dish has some serious identity crisis), bacon and egg ramen (let me explain further). 

Do not try this ramen if you've tried authentic japanese ramen before. It's terrible. It has absolutely no flavor and the noodles are off. You would have to pay me money to eat this ramen. Luckily it's only 8 bucks. I just have a high standard for ramen noodles because I've tried restaurants in LA, NY, Chicago, and DC."}
{"text":"Dining in is fine. Take out though... I love the food here but whenever I order online, it takes such a long time. I had ordered food at 1:20, hoping to get it at 1:35. Since I knew they would take a while, I went in at 1:55. It still wasn't ready when I got there so I sat for about 5 minutes. They had burnt an item in my order so I had to wait an additional 10 minutes. So a total waiting time of 50 minutes for a big bite and little bite with no compensation. I really do enjoy their food but it's a shame that the time I had to wait jeopardized my rating."}
{"text":"The thing about ninjas is that you don't know they are there.  Such is Ninja City,  bomb ass bar with great happy hour,  Asian fusion menu, good peeps abound.  However, like any real ninja, this place has remained under the radar.  Let's keep it that way."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Server was nice.  Went on a non busy afternoon with a party of 5 and was very surprised for over an hour wait for food.  Food was ok - but here's my problem. 

First of all - we got a tip added automatically to our bill - again 5 us.  Just 5.  6 or 8?  Sure. I get it.  But this was presumptive and shady.  It's also not listed anywhere on their menu they do this so our server apparently just opted to make some money.  This pissed me off. 

It also wreaks of subway. That's next door and the smell permeates the place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that there was an Asian fusion restaurant in walking distance near campus, but was greatly disappointed in the food here.
I just don't think that people who like Ninja City, know what good tasting Asian food is. 
Regardless of my \"meh\" attitude, I've been to ninja city in 4 separate occasions with only one OK visit.
The very first time I visited Ninja City, I was really craving some Korean food, so my friend took me out to dinner, but it turned out the rice was just not what I was expecting. It was very dry, hard to swallow, and bland. I just kept on eating because I was hungry, but the fish wasn't flavorful at all; I did not really like it at all, and just couldn't help but think it was a waste of money.
The Pho Beef Noodle Soup here, is the best that you can get near by Case walking distance. (If you have a car, I would recommend Superior Pho). They offer mint leaves and beansprouts to put in your broth, which is warm and soothing.
The Viet Noodle Salad is also just alright, and bland. I wish they would offer an spicier sauce with this dish...but it isn't horrible. I would eat it, if someone bought it for me. 

Options in general are a little bit pricey, which as a college student, is very important. Might be a really big reason why I don't like going very often, because the food just never seems worth the price I am paying. 
There is a bar that seemed to always have a couple of people every night, and also an upstairs dining area. Very trendy area and casual dining place. Service can be sometimes slow, but good. 

I probably would not choose to go back on my own."}
{"text":"We came here with family who are in town fornmy white coat ceremony. They came in on a delayed flight and were looking for late night munchies. Thankfully ninja city was open and allowed my under 21 brother to come in no problem.

First things first, amazing service from Dylan! Would come back just to get to know him!

The food was just okay though... great for late night food. 

Sweet potato fries: beer taste is real. Otherwise its really good. Portion size is just what I expected!

Chicken and waffles: this was one of the better dishes. It tasted great and the Asian twist on it was really tasty and not overpowering but added to the sweet tangy savory flavor profile of the chicken and waffles! Would recommend this one.

Vietnamese noodle salad: this one is just like dry vermicelli noodles! Great flavor. The carrots are cut a little bit thicker than I like but that's by preference.

Fried ice cream: actually amazing. Fresh fruit on the side and whipped cream with mint leaves. The presentation is beautiful and the flavor is awesome. Smaller size portion but amazing. Would totally come back for this one too.

tl;dr: open late, best service ever (look for an Asian guy named Dylan), get the chicken and waffles and fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Came for ramen honestly, been looking for a shop in CLE that can hit the mark for a long time now. Sadly...that wasn't the case. Broth was bland and most surprisingly lacked salt, which almost never happens when when the ramen isn't good. That said, all the little bites we had were good and I dug the ambiance a lot. Just a bummer about the noodles!"}
{"text":"Really surprised by this somewhat hidden place. My friend and I came in not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised to find an Asian fusion menu that was reasonably priced. There was also a small bar with a couple of patrons sitting as we walked in. 

We decided to sit down and eat and my friend had the bahn mi which she loved ( it was excellent because I tried it too ) and I went with the veggie ramen soup which was okay. Great selection of beers as well. I went with a Great Lakes option since I am not a native clevelander. 

Nice addition to the university circle area."}
{"text":"Bac is so last year; Ninja City is now where it's at. I had been putting off trying this place because we go to Bac often, and I figured it'd be much of the same food. I was so wrong! Ninja City is much more diverse and catered to a more casual crowd. You won't find much food over $10, but the quality is superb.

Ninja City is done Happy Dog-style with pencil and paper. There are several small bites and entrees to choose from, and you just bubble in what you want on the list. I ordered sweet potato tempura fries and a plate of three pork buns. The pork buns are topped with fresh cilantro and pickeled veggies, as well as some sort of divine spicy mayo. The combination of bbq pork and toppings with the gooey bun is just magic. 

Ninja City has stolen my heart. It has most of my Bac favorites without the oversized portions and inflated prices. They have great specials too, expanding an already awesome list of choices. The service is fast, and there always seems to be plenty of seating even during the busiest hours. It's a great spot for date night or gathering all of your buddies to share a ton of small plates."}
{"text":"Ever since I got back to CLE from NYC I've been on a mission to find the best bowl of ramen in Cleveland. I've always loved ramen and I was able to explore really amazing ramen when I lived in NYC. I can tell you Ninja City doesn't have the best bowl of traditional Japanese ramen. Because it is fusion, duh. However it is about 10,000x better than gross Noodle Cat.

I ordered the bacon and egg ramen. I've never had soup that tasted like ham before. I would have liked the soup base to taste more like pork, but not everyone's bacon ramen can measure up to Momofuku's. The spiciness of the soup eventually masks some of that salty preserved flavor. There was no seaweed :( but I understand why. Instead of bamboo shoots there were some kind of pickled onions, again fusion replacement = slight disappointment. Generous cuts of pork belly which I am always a fan of. Noodles were delicious and had a nice flavor by themselves.  The egg was cooked sunny side up and was nicely burned on the edges.. I would have preferred they ask me how I would like my egg Because I feel It should always be soft boiled, but it was tasty all the same. All together it made me think \"This is ramen for drunk people.\" 
I know what they were going for, BUT if they just dialed it back a bit and improved their broth so its no so ham tasting I'd be a regular.

Overall it wasnt what I wanted, but it wasnt inedible. I went to an Asian Fusion place wanting something closer to traditional. Good atmosphere, aesthetically pleasing, nice staff, cheap beer.

I would go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Eh...I've had great ramen, some bad ramen and just plain awful ramen.   Ninja City Kitchen's ramen probably lands between bad and awful.

I can't attest to decor or service since I ordered delivery with a group of work colleagues so my review/rating is simply for the food.

Half the orders were chicken ramen, the other half bacon and egg ramen and one veggie ramen.  The overall consensus from everyone was, eh.  Speaking of just my order of miso chicken ramen I thought the veggie broth was weak and way way too bland, where was the salt or umami?! There was also far too much cabbage in the broth and it created a very bitter taste. The chicken was moist but since it was poached it was pretty bland as well.  The noodles weren't bad, I just wish they had a chewier consistency.  The ramen could have been better with the addition of some nori vs the kombu that was in it, soft boiled soy eggs, or even added veggies like sprouts or corn - something, anything!!  I wasn't a fan of their veggie miso broth for the chicken ramen, maybe if it was a chicken miso broth it would have had more flavor.  I did however try a friends bacon and egg ramen, it wasn't bad it was just slightly salt-ier and weirdly had kimchi? Also I was not a fan of the fried egg vs a soft boiled egg, because really have you ever seen someone try to eat a fried egg in soup with chopsticks - stuff was flying everywhere...

This place just isn't for me unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great space, good food. Especially the Bacon and egg ramen. I enjoy the Kimchi add in, although the noodles aren't as good as Dante or Noodlecat, the broth is pretty legit. We will be back for another great family meal."}
{"text":"I live in Uptown so when I heard about Ninja City I was very excited to try it out. Especially since they advertised vegan and gluten free options. I have Celiac so I have to eat gluten free. 
The first thing I noticed was that there were only 2 gluten free meal options, and a couple different gluten free appetizers. I was pretty let down because you can make so many more meal options based on rice or rice noodles that don't have gluten in them. The menu overall was a  let down. 
I ordered the Korean rice bowl with white rice and chicken, I also informed the waiter about my diet restrictions. When the food came it looked different than I expected but still good. At first I wasn't sure I liked how it tasted but the more I ate the more I enjoyed it. It was still sub par but not bad. I left thinking maybe I'd come back. 
As soon as I got back to my apartment my stomach was in so much pain, I knew what I ate wasn't gluten free. I felt like I ate a lot of gluten and I was confused because my dish was just rice chicken and vegetables. But then I remembered it came with a cup of sauce that I had poured over the whole thing. And I'm thinking the sauce definitely had gluten in it. So I'm pretty sure my waiter did not listen to me or was unaware the sauce had gluten in it or something. I ended up getting really sick after eating here and with their limited options and possibly poor service I will not be back."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude service.  I don't care if the food is good or not, what a bunch of douche bags running the place.  Get over yourself, guys.  The short guy seating people on a Friday night with the glasses... what a prick. We walked out because he was such a jerk.  What an awesome power trip you are on, bro.  You are working in a crappy restaurant on a Friday night... #shortmansyndrome."}
{"text":"I cant believe people are still eating at this place after this article was written about it. Needless to say, you will never catch me anywhere near this racist and extremely rude facility. Plus, the stalker factor is straight up creepy.

{"text":"I knew I was at home when I walked into this place. Being greeted at the door by a Marvel vs. Capcom arcade game, Wu-Tang playing in the speakers, good food and a full service bar? It's a dream come true for me. The owner even bought me a beer when I beat the video game."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. First off, I love the old school hip hop music they play. Great vibes here.

We started off with the bacon guacamole and pork rangoon appetizers, which were both delicious. I ordered the bacon egg ramen as my main entree. Unfortunately, it was not as great. I wasn't a big fan of the noodles they used. The broth was interesting but not that flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the pho, which we both enjoyed. I wish they provided more herbs with it though. 

Overall, there are both hits and misses at Ninja City. I will still continue to come back and try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"It was a rainy cold day so I wanted some warm food. went there to have a bow of Korean beef noodle and didn't want to go there any more:( The food doesn't taste well in my view and the restaurant was very dim inside."}
