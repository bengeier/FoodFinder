{"text":"with my internet on the fritz, i desperately needed a place to finish up my grad school app's that had free wi-fi, wasn't crowded with undergrads, and had good, strong coffee. this particular espresso royale is just that, and then some.  great lattes, great teas, good soups and sandwiches, and decent baked goods (only for when you really need a sweet fix). not to mention that anytime you come in here, you're greeted with a smiling barista who remembers your drink and always engages in conversation. perfecto."}
{"text":"This espresso is way better than all the ones close to campus. Quieter, better seating, easy parking.  My favorite thing is the vanilla tea latte. It's very sweet but I love it. The chai latte I had here was not very good, it was really watery. But the vanilla tea latte is great."}
{"text":"While this place is busy, I can only assume it's because they are the only coffee house in the area.   The coffee is overly roasted and tastes like it has sat to long.   The steamed drinks taste like desert clay... Meaning the are dry and really Â€$&@ing hot. Like you can't even drink it for 45min without risking burning you lips off. Do they know how to steam milk there?   I have worked in 4 different coffee houses before, and officially done some barista competitions, including judging, and Espresso Royal is really far from coffee royalty. It's a place you go when you have not other options.   HOWEVER! All the staff has been friendly to me that 4 times I have gone. And the atmosphere is decent.   You could do worse... Like McDonalds, but over all, this is a 3 start joint."}
{"text":"So many selections!  The lattes are smooth.  They can make your drink any way you'd like...soy sugar-free syrups etc.    I love the extremely well organized fixins area.    The mugs for sale are very tempting.  Prices are comparable to Starbucks, and they have free wi-fi.  Comfortable, open, lounge type space."}
{"text":"Great coffee and service -- excellent staff.  Great atmosphere BUT not enough couches (and that Santa Claus guy is always sitting in the only one I think is comfortable).  I would honestly go here more if I thought I could find a comfortable place to plop down."}
{"text":"Good espresso.  Wifi, space, people, water, music, vegan muffins."}
{"text":"Clean & less busy than campus/other locations, this Espresso Royale is a bit more chill while serving up the same good coffee drinks. Sometimes it's crowded here but on most days, it's easy to find a table."}
{"text":"Ordinarily a good experience, but a surly, eye-rolling, wannabe-hipster barista wouldn't prepare my order because the blender was dirty, then barked an order at me to wait at the far end of the bar for my order (nobody else was in-line) and walked off before giving anything.   I stood around at the bar waiting for him to return and when he finally did, with great exaggerated effort, asked if there was something else.   \"Yes, I'm waiting for the pastries.\"   Sigh. Here.   \"Can I have a cream cheese?\"  Sigh. Eye roll. Yes, here. ... Walks off ...  My hands were full and couldn't carry my \"to go\" order and needed a cup carrier.   After standing around for several minutes, finally a young woman cleaning in the back (I think the only one putting any effort in) came up and politely asked if she could help."}
{"text":"The coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed. The staff is clean and knowledgeable of the drinks. I have the pleasure of dealing with Kayla or Jackson most of the time and they are both very good at their jobs. I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Good friendly helpful service. Convenient location. Parking can be iffy but extra spaces at Walgreens. Nice place to hang out and get some work done. Often have daily specials that really are special. Pastries and cookie options are good. Outdoor patio is very pleasant 6 months of the year."}
{"text":"Tea and chai is delicious. It's often crowded with people getting together for a chat. If you're looking for something a little more quiet, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Speaking specifically of this location...easily the best in town. Great drinks, plenty of seating, and generally friendly staff.   Drink an espresso based drink here,  they're better than the brewed coffee. Parking is tight at this location.   Also, get a rewards card and earn a free drink!"}
{"text":"The location at Windsor and Duncan is my favorite. The flavored coffee they brew is the best flavored coffee in town."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich while travelling. It was an english muffin with ham egg and cheese. The sandwich itself was actually good. My dad insisted we drive to Espresso Royale because he likes that place, so I guess it was just coincidence that I was already annoyed when I got there. They made our sandwiches and his coffee. They left our sandwiches in the bag sitting on the counter by the stove for a while until we asked someone to stop and give us our food that was now getting cold. The sandwiches were just ok quality, the service can improve."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I have lived in Champaign now for 3 years and this was my first visit to this coffee shop in the strip mall at Village Green. There was ample parking and the ordering process was quick. The baristas are not as friendly as the ones you meet at Bigby, but there is a less corporate feel than Starbucks. I ended up getting a large polar mocha. It had a very strong bean flavor and the consistency of it was better than the watery frozen fraps you get at starbucks. Free WIFI and plenty of seating in the store. There is also many options for coffee which is great. Overall it is likely a step up from starbucks, but the baristas could definitely be friendlier.  Pros: daily specials, lots of options including sandwiches s well  Cons: baristas could be a bit more friendlier  Hidden deals: Daily specials Monday- 3 dollar mocha Tuesday- Cappucino upgrade Wednesday- 2.50 latte, 3.10 large iced Thursday- Free flavor shot Friday- 2.50 Chai, 3.10 large iced, 1 off bag of beans Saturday- double punch for large Sunday- 1 hot tea, 50 cent polar cap There is a card for frequent purchases, however I am unclear the benefit of buying drinks frequently  Health code rating: B. http://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=546 Looks clean, but some bad marks on the champaign health site"}
