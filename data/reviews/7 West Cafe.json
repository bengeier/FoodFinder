{"text":"My friend and I were bored one late late night, and quite famished, so we decided to google a 24hour restaurant; alas we stumbled upon this quaint little cafe. It wasn't ANYTHING like the pictures and website described it to look like. I was quite disappointed with the false advertising I received. It's not as nice as they make it out to be...AT ALL. It's anything but nice (in terms of what you're promised)...but it's got character, and its 24-HOURS. You can't beat 24/7...ESPECIALLY when they make desserts as deliciously as they do here. I inhaled some 4 slices of cake in one sitting! It was so moist and soft, it sort of just melted in my mouth. I barely had to chew. Oh yes, another thing I didn't find to my liking was the TERRIBLE SEATING! In every direction, there are people just an arm's length away. I'm VERY seat picky, they really took the terms 'close&cozy' to the next level. It was uneasy, and uncomfortable, I could hear my neighbour table's entire conversation. TMI lol."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday around 3pm for drinks. Well, the wine and margarita were all right~ the impressive dish has to be Nachos~it has to be the most healthy Nachos I've ever had LOL It took around 25mins, but it was good! Not oily at all! As a cheese-stretcher, I was happy"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had the virgin pasta and it was good. My friend's Pasta What was a bit too salty. Atmosphere was cozy. Service was quick. Good spot for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Ok so this is how I will break it down...  Good for: A quiet drink alone, a date, a good catch up with a friend, a break up spot, an after-movie-lets-chat-about-the-film, I've-got-time-to-kill-before-I-meet-someone, or a pre going out meeting spot that is low vibe.  Not Good For: Group birthdays, group of friends meeting spot, or any type of group outing for that matter. Hard pounding shot games, anyone looking for an up-tempo atmosphere.  I love love this place. But I love the 7 west bread with a bottle of wine, a drink or a coffee, opposed to a \"nice dinner out\" scenario. It is wonderful and has it's rightful intellectual place in the city!  Go"}
{"text":"I never thought I would write such a bad review for 7 West cause I always liked the place and the food but after yesterday's experience I ought to say something.  I was aware that their food is pricey but the quality and portion size made it worth it, at least that was my last impression. Little did I know that a basic spaghetti dish that has olive oil, garlic, vegetables & chicken pieces would be so badly made and I would be charged $20 for it.  There was no flavour to it whatsoever, there were hardly any vegetables and the garlic was flakes sprinkled on top of the dish. Even the bread they served with it wasn't fresh. To make matters worse the waitress didn't think to bring any parmesan or pepper so I ended up asking for it. She looked surprised and hesitant but she brought me some anyway. The whole thing was a mess.   I regretted ordering food but I thought that at least some cake after would make up for it. I ended up ordering my absolute favourite cake there which is the carrot cake. For the life of me I never thought they'd dare to serve old cake! The frosting wasn't as bad but the cake itself was dry and you could tell that it must've been sitting on the counter for days. I got so disappointed it ruined my whole dinner. I thought about sending it back, which come to think of it now I should've but I didn't. That was my mistake.  I truly hope that this was just a one time thing and that the place isn't losing it's quality. That'd be sad. For the time being I'd like to forget and I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Don't go there for food. It's overpriced compared with their quality, and the menu is rather boing I'd rather go to a bar. They don't even offer weekend brunch now. So....disappointing. Their salad isn't very fresh, half the leaves look stale and I had to pick good ones from the mix and left the stale.   The service is ok for me all the time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of 7 West, it's my go to first date place! I'm single and recently I have had at least 4 first dates here, I feel like the staff probably get what I'm up to hehe. Being centrally located close to yonge and bloor subway is ideal for a first date so neither party has to traipse to one end or another of the city for the first date.  7 West has 3 beautiful floors, the top floor being my favourite with it's gorgeous stained glass and comfortable enclosed \"patio\".   I'd give the food 3 out of 5 stars, it's comfort food. I've never been disappointed by a meal there but never been blown away either. It's not the best you'll ever have but you are sure to find something you would like. The desserts are great. I shared a slice of some kind of chocolatey/vanilla cake recently and it was divine.   I love this place for first dates because it has a warm and comfortable atmosphere, perfect for conversation. It never feels loud at 7 West especially in comparison to a chain restaurant like Jack Astors.   Open 24/7 its also a great place to wind down after a night out. I especially like their specialty teas and hot drinks that have liqueur in them.   All around a great place for conversation and cozy hangouts. I'd also like to shout out to the staff who have always been super friendly, helpful, and always takes the time to check on you and make sure you have everything you need."}
{"text":"The only reason why I would come here is for its hours - it's open 24 hours.  Everything else is meh. Both the service and the food. Didn't have a good experience with their service at all.  It feels & looks like a dive bar, in a run-down, old house. If you like that kind of atmosphere, you will definitely like this one."}
{"text":"How precious a 24 hour cafe is!!!!! So hard to find a place for a late night snack in downtown. They have great sandwiches and cakes! Quite a nice place for dates  because of the dull lighting. I found some thingies in the drawers of my table, they are hilarious to read. Con side: things are a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Relaxed downtown & late-night institution. Not too fancy. Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere; would recommend to grab a quick or off-hours meal. Very enjoyable for what it is."}
{"text":"Really beautiful, intimate place - perfect for a date. Service can be slow but the waiters are courteous and the food is lovely.   They have great vegetarian/vegan options to choose from, and they are very accommodating to requests. They also have an amazing selection of cakes and desserts (*normal/vegetarian ones, not vegan).   The light is a little dim but I suppose it's part of the mood.   Definitely recommend, it will for sure be one of my regular date spots :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the fact that it NEVER closes, although that doesn't really matter to me, because it's not like I've been at 4am! The nachos are delicious, the coffee is awesome, and I find the portions fair. It's a little pricey, but overall, worth it. It's really cozy and romantic. The tables are quite small, but the lowered lights, and candles on the tables give it a very intimate feeling. Just be aware that if you go a bit later, and it's busy, it can get pretty loud. Of all the times I've visited, I've only eaten on the main floor. The one time my boyfriend and I went to the 2nd level, it was really cold. Also, the washrooms on the 2nd level are insanely skinny and small (but I really don't care about that), however, I got a very weird vibe when I was up there. Like I wasn't alone. And I don't normally feel or believe anything like that. So that being said, I either do what I have to do *very* quickly, or try to avoid the washroom!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Friday around 5:30. Good number of tables available. We went to the second floor which was a bit louder than the main but fine. We split a caesar salad and it was very good. I had the Penne Arrabiata - very spicy and good! My wife had the Penne Chicken and she said it was really good as well. I had to try the Belgian Dark Chocolate Cake and it was good, but I've had better. I have a real sweet tooth and it could have been sweeter! All in all a very good place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed an early lunch here. Our kind server recommended the asparagus ravioli and tuna melt. We stared both. Very tasty and they came with salads. They have NEVER closed in 25 years! They're open all day EVERY day!"}
{"text":"I may be a bit biased in writing such a stellar review for this place, but I am sentimental about it!  To start off, this place is open WELL into the night. You can have a steak at 4 am (yes, ppl have done that)  The location and decor: 7 West is located in a Victorian townhouse on Charles west.The decor is shabby-chic with quite a bit of kitch perpetuating throughout. I guess they were going for a vintage look, and somehow ended up painting the ceiling with little clouds and brass mirrors. They did succeed in creating an overall cozy atmosphere. The tables and chairs are wood and very close to one another, sometimes you may have difficulty leaving your seat.  The staff : goes hand in hand with the decor - very hipster looking, I can almost see them having coffee-shop philosophical discussions about what Marx really meant. But they are laid back (whether this is chemically induced or not is tbd) almost blase and helpful. They will not be kissing your butt, fake smiling and asking you what you need every 5 minutes, but if you DO need something, they will come by your table and help you out.  Food: the food is a fusion between Italian (I believe this is what they were going for) and comfort food. Some of my favs are the rosy ravioli and the chicken caesar salad (the best I have ever had anywhere - and I eat a LOT of caesar salad) which comes with a LOT of chicken. Drinks are pricey, and standard. For dessert the dolce de leche and the red velvet and a must. Overall however, the food is nothing spectacular, but you will not leave hungry.  Prices: It is pricier than some places serving the same dishes, but I found their portions pretty big.  I do love this place. It is a safe bet every time I am in the area whether we are looking for lunch or a dinner before going out."}
{"text":"Been a regular visitor since 2006. Have to admit that service has declined as years have passed. The food is still good and so are deserts. I love their Pesto pizza with salad on the side. All in all one of few good places that are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"After a night of trying to figure out where to go for drinks on King St. West, we finally decided that getting some grub was a better idea. We rolled into 7 West around 1am and got a table on the 1st floor. Odering a mix of hummus, pizza, cheese garlic toast and cake...we were set! The chocolate banana cake was AMAZING!!! I will go back and eat this again and again and again...and I will bathe in it...if it's ever allowed. WOW....it was so good. The hummus was hummus, altough very genrously portioned. The pita pizza, looked more pita than pizza and our friend who ordered the cheese garlic toast inhaled it before she offered anyone a try (B*tc!!h) Again...GO HERE AND ORDER THE CHOCOLATE BANANA CAKE!!!"}
{"text":"This place degraded far worse than we tought. We visited for dinner, food - we ordered a plate of Nachos and Pepperoni/Mushroom pizza. Terrible! Everything is store-bought, and pizza was soggy, undercooked, sauce from a can, basically tasted like an unedible microwave meal (and it was), over priced, and if you are going to eat stay away! Service was also beyond depressing, dirty plates served, cutlery looked like it's from salvation army, the servers didn't know what they are doing, and didn't even bother to clean dirty dishes off our table until we made a point of them doing so. Drinks - are ok, but for some reason they invented a \"cap\" of 3 drinks per night, besides you won't miss much because nothing special there too. Decor was dreadful, rocky tables, music was blasting so loud you can barely hear yourself think, overall this used to be a good place - a few years ago. not anymore, i recommend to stay away and don't waste your money as it's way overpriced for the quality of food/drink/service. Conclusion: Stay away."}
{"text":"Great place to get your bacon and egg craving at 12am. Good cocktails, relaxed vibe. Lots of floors for options and delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"In the 90s, I was all about 7 West after a solid night at some second rate martini night at a deep-house club. Then I got back into my metal roots in the 00's and it became all about the Shanghai cause that was next to The Bovine, where I boozed away my early twenties. In high school, I used to work on papers and study on their tiny third floor patio that was semi-covered in the winter and always a smoking area, even though it was covered.  Essentially it's three narrow floors of a café, with a nicer restaurant on the bottom floor. But what's really good is that it's open 24-7 which is nice when you need a café style sandwich at 4am. The crowd for the late night is usually a mix of drag queens, club drunks and just those late night people who love things like internet cafes and seem to just hang out all the damn time; chatting and drinking tea in oversized cups. My top pick is their tuna melt. That's the jam right there for sure."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast based on really liking the sister restaurant (the Smith).  What was supposed to be a simple breakfast, toast and coffee was surprisingly disappointing.  Toast was cold when finally delivered, as was the breakfast blt, and the coffee burnt.  To make matters worse, we were offered a top up to our coffee (simple black filter coffee) and charged another $3 per. Not really appreciated, especially for bad coffee.  Unlikely to return. We went for the basics and left disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's 5:30 AM right now and I've just had the best Calzone ever"}
{"text":"* * * * 7 West is a game-changer!   This place is 24-7-365!! seriously, it's always open. This place is a super cozy and intimate hot spot to go with a few friends for anytime (prefer: late night) cuisine or on a date (I've brought more than a few first dates here). And surprisingly, not every person knows about this little gem!   Now, I want you to imagine yourself in the Yonge/Bloor area, it's 4 a.m., it's been an amazing night with you and your friends, but now you're all starving.. some people will settle for McDonald's, others want breakfasty-food.. 7 West is the answer. It offers an exceptional menu with dozens of meals--burgers/sandwiches to salads/soups to entrees and breakfast foods. They serve great coffee, and if the time is right, even alcoholic coffee beverages.   Definitely a good choice at any time, but personally, I like going late nights when the candles lit up the wooden interior of the room and the small rooms make for great fun.   Menu: http://www.7westcafe.com/7westmenu.pdf Recommendations: Penne Chicken, Penne Arrabiata, Mac N' Cheese with bacon/ham, All-Time Breakfast, (Double Stack) Grill Cheese with bacon/ham, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Irish Whiskey Coffee, and ANY desert.   Keep it classy ladies and gentlemen, enjoy!  -Ace  \"There cannot be good living where there is not good drinking\""}
{"text":"This 3-level restaurant cafe complete with a third floor patio is a great place for dessert, coffee and chatting among friends.  At least, I assume coffee - not much of a coffee drinker but it seemed fitting to mention it anyway.  Dessert of choice: Hands down! Dulce de Leche cheesecake. DE-FRAKKIN'-LICIOUS! Creamy smooth caramel cheese smothered (yes, smothered) with a thick and rich caramel sauce topping. A true delight to savour and not share.  If you do choose to have dinner, their pasta is amazing. I'll tell you this, I never order lasagna in a restaurant because how can it possibly match that of my mother's? Well, sir - this is the lasagna that might rival homemade. Bold statement, I know! That's how serious I am."}
{"text":"Not the best place you can eat in the Yorkville area, but the best selling point for this place is that it's open 24 hours. The dining area on the ground floor has a quasi romantic vibe and the two floors above are a bit more casual if you can make it up their narrow staircase.  Pasta dishes here are pretty delish and their desserts are decent."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions due to the great atmosphere, hours, location (close to Yonge and Bloor!), service and food. It`s my go-to place when in the area and looking for a low-key place with a cozy atmosphere. Bonus: It`s a great option for a nice casual date!  The service is never lacking here. Kudos to them! It's great to have a reasonably priced 24/7 cafe with many food options, one better than the next. I've introduced several people to this place and they have always been impressed with everything.  7 West is just too difficult to keep a secret!"}
{"text":"This place is the coolest; no exaggeration.  It was another late night study session, this time for an English exam.  7 West has the ability to make studying something super lame not that lame.  I would even consider studying science here *gasp!*  I had a cappuccino, in a mug.  Next time I'll get a bowl.  Why?  Because you get a lot more drank for a little more money, and because drinking out of a bowl is avant-garde.  Reasons to love it:  The atmosphere is dark and mysterious, the staff is really friendly, the bathroom is under the stairs in the basement (it's cool, trust me), and there are THREE FLOORS!"}
{"text":"Went to 7 West, hadn't been there is years. Last time I was there was a little (lot) tipsy and remember little except it was good times :).  Ordered the Chicken Carbonera it was nice and hot and yummy. My friend ordered the Cheesy Burger, it was a little bit small and I felt bad because he couldn't share my food due to milk intolerance.  We ate on the 3rd floor at around 6pm and it was empty but slowly filled. No one was next to us so we had privacy to chat which was nice.  Overall food was yummy and it bought back fond memories, cause the first time though I don't remember what we ate was soooo much fun.  Service was good, food was good. Read the reviews and wanted desert but didn't have enough space. We'll go back again for desert."}
{"text":"Go here if you like to gamble. It's a crap shoot and the house always wins lol. Usually poor, sometimes good sometimes horrible service. Sometimes edible sometimes awful food. On the bright side: cheap drinks and really really really good cakes."}
{"text":"Open 24/7, including New Year's Eve so you can do countdown here.  Their lunch portion was actually enough for me, so I don't know how people finish the dinner menu LOL  I either go here for food, dessert (cake + coffee), or drinks. It's a hipster place with good atmosphere.  Good for dates, or group outings."}
{"text":"Everything here is middle of the road. There's absolutely nothing that stands out, but then again, it never fails you either. Good vegetarian choices, and a pretty tasty BLT.  The true winning quality is that it's open 24/7/365. That is fairly rare, and I don't know another place in Toronto that does it."}
{"text":"What a great place. Wonderful pasta, salads and great service.  It's small (cozy) so you might have to wait... We shared the Moroccan Chili, a house salad and the Penne Arrabiata. The portions were  fresh, very tasty and generously sized. This place is a gem ihmo and wouldn't hesitate to return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Located in an old house near U of T, 7 West has a pretty cool atmosphere. The first floor is darker and more romantic-looking, while the top two floors are brighter and better for larger groups. The restaurant is usually full of students and open 24/7, which makes it a great late-night option. I went on a  Sunday afternoon, and it was pretty quiet.   The menu is pretty broad, offering sandwiches, pasta and pita pizzas. For about $7, you can get a decent bowl of vegetarian chili or Moroccan white bean chili (with pita) - I've had both; they're full of flavour - and good for a light meal. My friend ordered a turkey breast sandwich, but for $12, it wasn't that impressive - deli meat, plain white bun, potato chips - not fries.They also have a brunch menu on weekends - pretty standard bacon, egg, omelette, panckae-type options for around $10.    Lastly...... shout outs to the friendly waiter who killed the wasp flying near our table!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best places in the city to eat. It's fabulously open 24.7 so you can enjoy their outstanding menu any time of the day. Its three different floors offer different vibes- my fav is the top floor with its church pew benches and angled ceiling- Its like you're in a secret church attic. Its a great place for a date with low-lighting, good music and tasty food. The portions are pretty generous and you definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"24 Hours?! Why you no tell me! Well now I know, I'm in for it for any late night snacks after I finish work.    Stopped upon 7 West Cafe today after I finished work which was appox. after 11PM as my stomach was growling I was looking around for restaurants which were still open and hoping I would stop upon one or else I will just go to my last resource which is McDonalds.  But didn't give up there until I saw  the sign \"OPEN 24 HOURS\" and I was just like Score, this is better than having McDonalds.    This place is a pretty decent cafe/restaurant in my opinion although it's a pretty dark and is a pretty crowded place also.  However, the food spoke for itself.  The service was alright, the waitress looked kinda sleepy/down and didn't really smile at all but still gave me her recommendations.  While for the food, I ordered a Turkey Melt and a Macchiato.  The turkey melt was good enough to satisfy my hungry tummy.  While the Macchiato, I was not really a fan of it and probably won't order it again  the next time I come back.  In my opinion, other cafes can actually make better Macchiato than the one I had, it just didn't taste right."}
{"text":"7 West is such a great little spot. My favorite is the upstairs, with it's church pews, dim lights, patio and great wine selection. I used to come here all the time for casual dinners with friends, date night drinks, and after hours quiet conversation. It is a must for anyone wanting to explore real Toronto. And it's where I always go when I'm home to catch up with friends, usually over a bottle of wine and their yummy hummus plate."}
{"text":"This place was great, it had character and ambiance. I was visiting Toronto from the States and wanted a place away from tourist. I only had dessert but it was fantastic and my friend and I were raving about the water. I know it's simply water, but it was better than all others we had in Toronto.   The crowd was of 20 somethings and maybe some 30 somethings. Very chill, laid back and mature people. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The Dulce de Leche chessecake is over priced at $9 and a disappointment to my palate.  Just Desserts around the corner at Yonge and Wellsely is so much better, cheaper and homemade!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on mother's day with family .The French toasts were excellent along with maple syrup . The sausages and eggs were good too. Unlimited refill of coffee and it was a good start to a day dedicated to remembering and respecting all women who are moms."}
{"text":"Restaurant ouvert 24h sur 24. Peut-être pas la meilleure gastronomie, mais le service est toujours courtois, et le menu est bien correct. Bonne pâtes, entrées et brunch!"}
{"text":"I had the munchies at 5 am on the street and overheard a group of stoners talking about food and instinct immediately followed. Alas, 100 km later I arrived at 7 west cafe, I was greeted by George Washington and sat on a knife that was embedded in my chair. Loved the warm friendly atmosphere, had a conversation with a lamp post from Egypt over a plate of salsa on bread (bruschetta).   After ingesting the penne I didn't order, I went into the washroom. I was perfusely sweating and wanted to check myself but the mirror appeared to be the funhouse variety. Sweet. After the faucet broke off I stealthily paid my bill to Abe Lincoln and left. My liver and stomach hurt, but hey its 24/7."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated for what it is: high priced food which is at best mediocre.  Whenever I ordered anything off of the menu, I was always told that I could not order it without a certain item.  For instance, if I didn't want olives on the pasta, the waiter would indicate that the olives are a part of the sauce which was made as a batch.  This makes it impossible for them to take the olives out.  The impression that I got from this place is that most people are here for the ambiance.  House or electronic music is being played--it depends on what floor you're on for the type of music you're going to listen to. The place use to be filled up with a bunch of dressed up hipsters and artsy types. I don't know if it is still a popular hangout."}
{"text":"I went there twice. One of the best 24 hours places. Their food is fancy comparing it to fran's (another 24 hours restaurant); however, they have fabulous desserts! I tried the chocolate cake and it was amazing. Also tried pearls and diamonds, amazing layered red velvet cake and cheesecake.. Trust me it's beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  AMAZING FOOD, OPEN 24/7, FANTASTIC SERVICE!  What more can you ask for?  A few friends and I went there at 3 in the morning after a night out. Promptly greeted at the front door and given a table upstairs. We were all hungry but didn't know exactly what we wanted so we decided to get a bunch of dishes and just share them. We got a Greek Salad, a pepperoni pizza, a Poutine, their Mac & Cheese and for dessert their triple chocolate cake and red velvet cake.   Their food is spectacular! Come with a bunch of your friends and order whatever you want. I promise you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The third floor patio/shed room is so nice and comfy, I could sit here all afternoon. We really just popped in for coffee and got a couple of latte bowls which are massive lattes serves in a bowl cup thing. I'll definitely come back when I'm hungry to check out the menu."}
{"text":"To be honest, at 4am there wasn't much choice for me and my friends. We found this place through yelp as we were on vacation on Toronto and hungry at 4am. The descriptions given are pretty accurate, it is a really nice chill place with good music. The food was pretty good too.   I would definitely go back to it again when I find myself in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Nice strong drinks. Reasonable prices for downtown Toronto. Yummy soup. Kick ass cool candlelit church setting.  Almost romantic if it weren't so loud. Fantastic service. Would definitely come back here. Glad I discovered it."}
{"text":"Dimly lit with an eye-pleasing wooden interior. This three-story restaurant is great if you want to stop by for some bruschetta (as I did) and a few beers. 4 beers and a cheese bruschetta appetizer came out to be about 24$. I think it might have been a mistake? Or maybe there was a special I didn't know about. Anyways, would stop by this place again to try some pie, I heard they were tasty.  By the way, it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, the best lentil soup ever, excellent salads, and great ambience. Three floors of service, so be prepared to climb stairs."}
{"text":"Worst thing about this place: the disturbingly loud music.   Otherwise, this place is pretty good. I've been several times and I'd highly recommend their poutine and pastas. The burgers and sandwiches I've had taste fine too, but portion sizes tend to be smaller than their pastas. If you are looking for something 'healthier', their pita pizzas come with a generous portion of salad.  Service is almost always pleasant, polite, and efficient.   Would come here much more often with friends if the music was less loud as it just does not make sense to have to shout above the music, and other customers who are also trying to talk above the music."}
{"text":"The vibe here is cool, I'll give them that. The food here is only ok. I had a pizza and I wasn't blown away by it. I came here with a friend who had just come back from Italy and he was horribly disappointed by the quality and taste of the pizza. The service was only ok, it took forever for the waitress to give us our bill. I also ordered a coffee when I first sat down and it only came when the pizza was served (after I asked the waitress about my coffee). The ventilation here is also terrible. When I was there, I sat on the second floor and the smoke from the kitchen came towards the dining area and I could hardly keep my eyes open by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"What a Gem!  A 24/7 restaurant/cafe that ISN'T creepy, now that's almost impossible to find in Toronto. I almost what to keep this place to myself, but it's too good not to recommend.    With multiple levels the space in quaint and cozy with lots of seating. I just could not get over the atmosphere!   The service is causal and fun, which is not what you'd expect from people that have to work the graveyard shift (I was there around 1am to 3am).    The food was great! Nothing extraordinary, but great all in all. It's just nice to know there's no limit to the menu, you can order whatever you want whenever you want, dinner for breakfast or vice versa, that's rare.   One thing I would have liked to known before I went was about the crowd at the restaurant. I was hesitate that the 24 hour thing may invite a sketchy or drunk element, but no, the crowd there there for food and privacy, which I found important.    Definitely a place I'll go again! Probably around 1am again... just because I can lol."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden... I wouldn't call it a gem but maybe something of similar sorts. The service here was great but the food wasn't all the best, the decor was nice but a bit too dark for my liking. Perhaps I was just having a bad night, I'll most likely come back and try again during the day. Heard great things about their dessert."}
{"text":"The service was okay, took a while to even acknowledge us on the way in but the actual server was friendly and nice.   As for the actual food, service was very slow - took almost 30 minutes for two entreés for two people.   The decor and atmosphere is really nice and is what initially draws you in but the food is a bit overpriced and isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"BOOO I wanted this place to be so much better than it was :( The drinks are WAY over priced... a run of the mill 355 ml beer will set you back at least 8 bucks! The building has three fun, starlit levels, but nothing makes it so great that I feel good about spending 80 bucks on an ok dinner and small sized drinks."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the quality of food depends on what you order. Their 7 west sampler platter was just ok and I can't really say it was a memorable dish. Went back the second time and ordered the arugula salad topped with goat cheese, pine nuts, avocado, chicken and it was amazing!  I also like that they are always open and that the breakfast menu can be ordered at any time. The restaurant offers great ambiance. It's very cozy with dark lighting, relaxing music and you will never feel rushed to leave."}
{"text":"A quality option for late-night eats.  A cozy atmosphere (which is good, 'cause it's loud), friendly lighting, and a diverse assortment of comfort foods.  I found their alfredo-type sauce in my chicken pasta dish super-uninspired (tasted like it came out of a jar), but I've had that experience at most non-Italian restaurants.  I'll definitely go back and try something else when I'm hungry at 3am."}
{"text":"SERVICE IS SO RUDE HERE. came for my friends birthday, waitress took forever to come and when she did she seemed very grumpy. \"What do you want?\" We asked her what a bar rail was, and I swear to God this girl goes \"you dont know what a bar rail is?\" In the RUDEST way possible, sour look on her face. Food took a long time to come. They didnt seem to like us for some reason cause they just had huge attitude no matter how polite we were being. We were confused. Scoffed when we asked for water refills. Literally scoffed. Food was okay. They kept dimming the lights too so you could barely see. When the bill came, she had included a pretty generous tip for herself. NEVER coming back. Never been treated so rudely by service staff in my life."}
{"text":"People go to restaurants for various reasons such as excellent quality of food, good prices, location and convenient hours, friendly staff, etc. On those criteria, I'd say that 7-west cafe (Located at 7, Charles st. West) ranks the highest on convenience and hours of operation. The cafe is open 24 hours making it one of the few such places in the city that entertain a middle-of-the-night craving for food.  The food is good, certainly not dripping in grease, but about 15-20% higher than the price point I estimated for that kind of food. Over several visits I have tried their all-day breakfast, soup, vegetarian chili, personal pizza and a couple of sandwiches such as the grilled veggie. Service leaves room for improvement but I don't expect great service at such places anyway.  For a late night binge, the place is excellent. During the rest of the day there are numerous options around here."}
{"text":"Came here for an Easter weekend dinner when my parents and siblings were in town. Most of the clientele was 20s-40s couples or groups of friends, but I also think it was an excellent choice to come with family.  Everyone agreed that the service and the food were four stars. The desserts in particular were a highlight.   A word of warning to the GF customer: there are virtually no gluten-free options here, as everything is basically pasta, pizza or sandwiches. I ended up having the Moroccan chili and a salad, which were both delish, but pretty much my only dinner options."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Good food, great location.   Been here a couple of times either before or after catching a movie at the nearby Cineplex.  The times I've been here I've had the pulled pork, the montreal smoked meat sandwich, the lasagne and the penne arrabiata.   Everything was quite delicious (I especially enjoyed the lasagne!) and the waitresses in my experiences have been delightful.   My only concern is that the sandwiches come with crisps (chips) and not fries, which is kind of a disappointment."}
{"text":"I was there with another friend after having dinner elsewhere one night. We stopped for a few drinks; the atmosphere was nice as we were situated on the 3rd floor. Our initial server was kind and courteous. It appears shortly after she switched with another server; as another younger waitress (Female) came around asking if we required anything else. We were thinking about getting a hot drink and asked whether they offered a mocha latte. The server, look at us in disappointment and responded \"this isn't a Starbucks\"....and gave us the menu with some degree of attitude.We were confused as the menu actually had a mocha latte; instead of responding back in similar style; we decided to take the higher ground and pay our bill and leave the premise. Clearly there is inconsistency in the way this establishment is run; perhaps a bit of snobbery. Its unfortunate, as our experience was ruined by such unprofessional servicing."}
{"text":"Great 24-hr location (location, location!) at Yonge and Bloor. Not Accessible (keep in mind for people with mobility issues or Accessibility issues, it should actually BE Accessible but doesn't appear to be) especially with 3 floors. Food is ok, but over years, the menu hasn't changed much. Food is so-so.   7 West has a great vibe, a cool ambiance, but service could be better, and very crowded at certain hours. A good place for a first date, but overall, it's a much younger and louder crowd which is totally fine, but expect a lot of noise, at times very loud music and almost sitting on top (literally) of the person or table beside you; it's that cramped. Über cramped.   Again, its 24 hr hours are great and location couldn't be beat. Overall not a bad place but don't expect super customer service at all or superb, out of this world food."}
{"text":"Went to 7 West Cafe  Journeyed with friends. Ordered nachos.   Nachos.   The cheese was weird. Is it cheese?   Just keep eating. It is open for 24 hours.   Forks on the floor. Why?  Don't ask questions. Just keep eating. It is open 24 hours.   The server kept asking me if I liked their washrooms. I didn't know.   Lasagna came. It was covered in the weird cheese. Just keep eating.   It is open 24 hours.   Is that blood?  Just keep eating. It's open 24 hours.   Peered into the kitchen. What nightmares are made of.   Hard to breathe.   Just keep eating.   To say that there was hair in my food would be incorrect.   More accurate to say that there was food in my hair.   Chef Boyardee would not approve of his sauce being used in this lasagna.   Just keep eating.   Is that guy dead?   Yes  \"This one is for the rituals!\" exclaimed the staff.   There is a dead man in the corner. He has expired.  Uttered his last meal order. Ate his last \"crisp\"  Came to the end of my meal. Bag my leftovers? No.   Walked out the door to the stares of onlookers. I made it out.   I did it.   I am free of the shackles of 7 West Cafe.   It is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"When one thinks of a restaurant open 24 hour's a day, the food is not going to be good. It is the polar opposite!  The menu offered a lot of innovative menu items sure to make every one happy.  The waitstaff was professional and polished.  The interior of the restaurant was very eclectic and very comfortable.  After dining at this \"gem\", it is obvious why this restaurant has been in business for so many years, a feat hard to achieve in the Toronto restaurant scene.  Get here as fast as you can!"}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I have heard nothing but wonderful things about 7 West Cafe from many of my coworkers. So I wasnt too surprised to walk in and find myself in a cozy/intimate setting surrounded by people who looked like they had been customers for years. In terms of the atmosphere and service, I give it an A+. Nice waitresses, rustic, pretty fireplace, food arrived quickly. But for food? These reviewers are smokin' ice.  A plate of ravioli is 16 dollars and its horrible! Not to mention the pathetic pizza my boyfriend got- Surely it came straight from the freezer. Or how about that $3 for the overcooked burger. Go here if you want cheesey maccoroni, or maybe a salad....or if you just want to sit in a nice place for a while. This is average priced foods, for below average quality. Not for me."}
{"text":"This place is great for those late night hunger pangs. But it's only OK when you have so many more options during the daytime hours.   For those late nights, here are the best things on the menu:  - Bruschetta  - Lasagna - Chocolate Banana Cake (this is awesome)"}
{"text":"A bad breakfast experience.  We tried it because of the high Yelp ratings.  To be fair, they apparently were \"down one cook\" (we were advised after a 40 minute wait).  But still, we were a party of 6, and there were only two other two-tops occupied, and even then we waited an hour for our food. Two of our party just had toast, so this was not complicated!  When it arrived, finally, the food was very average.  One of our party ordered oatmeal and it was dry to the point of inedible. My vegetable omelette wasn't cold, but it had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for a while before being served.  The service was barely adequate. Our server, while friendly, was inattentive. At one point I got up and grabbed the coffee pot from behind the bar and refilled our table's cups because she was no where to be found.  Remember, there were only three occupied tables in the place.  Unfortunately, this was our first time in Toronto, and hoped for a solid breakfast find - this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had brunch there on Saturday morning. The venue is very warm, spacious, with great lighting and ample comfortable seating. The bruschetta appetizer I ordered had the perfect mix of cheese and tomato salsa. The service was prompt, the server was pleasant and extremely helpful. I had the \"All day breakfast\" with turkey, sausage and scrambled eggs. All meats were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were excellent. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Pluses,   Open 24 hours, 3 floors, as you go upstairs, it gets progressively darker and more chill.  -Makes a great place to hang out with friends. The music is good and mixes between a little bit of everything from old school to rock alternative.   Rosie Ravioli and dark chocolate cake are better than average. Notable was the the sauce it was made with stewed tomato and the dark chocolate cake was fresh and moist.   Minuses,   So I was deciding on what to eat, browsing through my phone and our waiter notices I was looking at Yelp. He groans and exclaims, Yelp is the bane of his existence. Oh really I said.. he said that everyone is a restaurant critic. I told him the value is these are real reviews it really up to the consumer to decide. Plus it helps if you have friends on it with similar tastes.    Whatever this must have struck a nerve and later he dreamed up and idea and came by to the table and said,  'you know what would be original. mixing the ravioli and cake.' Okay trying to be funny, stand up hour?!. Anyways later he asked me what I thought of the food. I told him, read my Yelp review on it."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed lunch at 7 West Cafe. Great selection of sandwiches, and other menu items. Had the chicken club and it was delicious and flavourful, would recommend. If you're in the area, check it out for a reasonably priced meal and great hangout spot!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years now. Not quite on a regular basis, but definitely every chance I get because it's a good option for late night eats and if I'm in the neighbourhood at any time of day since it's open 24 hours.  Three floors to choose from and all with different decor and feel. It's quite eclectic and artsy which suits the service staff there as well.  Most are friendly, but service can be slow at times which is quite alright since this is a casual place. So don't come here if you want fine dining and to dine and dash in a hurry.  The menu is quite large and will suit every palates.  Food taste pretty good, prices are very reasonable and portions are substantial....what more can you ask for?  My recent visit I came solely for dessert and a cup of tea.  The slice of cake (Belgian Dark Chocolate)  was large and very scrumptious.  I finished the whole slice including icing on my own since my friend doesn't like sweets (who doesn't like desserts?).  Usually I find icing on cakes  sometimes too sweet, but this definitely hit the spot and I didn't regret eating every last bite.  Overall, a great place to chill at any time of day and the food is pretty good especially desserts."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I had the pesto pollo , it tasted soo good flavored just right. The cake here is amazing, one of the things that makes this place awesome! Along with its unique atmosphere,that reminded me of Amsterdam for some reason, this place has really great comfort food and drinks. Is a must stop for all foodies in Toronto. I recommend the Banana cake!"}
{"text":"The only 24/7 restaurant that I love in this city. Love this place for a nice evening with your friend. Must must try are the cheesecakes!!"}
{"text":"very nice ambience, and though the menu is fairly basic with familiar items, the quantity is enormous and quality is good too.  Service is good too, a little slow. Can't go wrong for value."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, not very fast.    Listed as not kid friendly, by my 3 girls ate cheese pizza and spaghetti.  The pita pizza was so so, but the spahgetti, especially with the sausage was great.  I had it for leftovers the next day and it was even better.  My wife had a morrocan chili that was great as well.  Overall good place to good, and open 24/7.  They have a small outdoor pation on the 2nd floor, which we didn't use."}
{"text":"7 West was a really sweet grungy vibe. 3 floors and we were able to lounge under the closed balcony to enjoy our drinks and food. The vibe almost felt like a rustic cottage. All three of us chose various pizzas on the menu which were all BOMB. The drinks are a little pricey but they have a great variety of white wines. Really enjoyed my visit and will definitely be back! (24h too? AWESOME)"}
{"text":"Great food. Came to the area for vacation from Virginia  and to celebrate my birthday. The server was fast and very nice. The cook had the food out in 10 minutes and it was cooked properly . Well done 7 west"}
{"text":"Came here last night with some friends, to catch up with a friend visiting from out-of-country.  I *think* I've been here before, but it's been ages. And according to my friends, it was THE place to come if you were (are?) a university kid.   We were up on the second floor - which was a bit sparsely populated early in the evening, but picked up after 10 p.m. Service was decent. I DID find the corner of the room in which were seated to be a bit cramped, as all the chairs were fairly close together. I was actually knocking knees with the friend I was sitting next to.  I ordered the Pasta What? with sausage, while my visiting friend had the macaroni & cheese, and another friend had the club sandwich. I think it was safe to say we were satisfied with our meals. My pasta was good, especially with the feta cheese and kalamata olives. Yum! I had ordered a white wine, but never got it. Oh well.  Dessert was fantastic. Since we all wanted cake, and we couldn't decide between the five of us, we splurged and each shared a slice of banana chocolate, double chocolate fudge, and dark Belgian chocolate cake. Delicious! I had to stop myself from ordering a glass of milk to wash it down.  But overall, it had a cozy, casual atmosphere, which I liked. I'd definitely consider coming again, if I ever wanted to hit up someplace in the Yonge/Bloor area."}
{"text":"Cute, cozy, Nice atmosphere, very good food, a little pricy! Best place to go for very late dinner!"}
{"text":"so I went back to 7 west recently for drinks with a date.  I was feeling a little hungry and cold so I ordered a chili.... then the waiter asked me normal or moroccan?  Moroccan chili, what's that? Waiter: I don't know but it gets ordered a lot, it must be good!    So I ordered it... big mistake.. huge!  besides taking about 25 mins to get it, the damn chili didn't look like chili at all, actually it was more like a been soup.  Literally some beans in a thickened broth with maybe some curry powder thrown in for spice... it was sort of like a baby food consitency with beans, how they have the nerve to have this item on the menu or even serve this crap and call it food is beyond me.  So not impressed, a can of soup would have had more flavour and ingrediants.  Yet again, I saw... food here is LACKING largely!"}
{"text":"This is going to become one of my new favourite places. First of all, + points for 24 hours. I had been looking for a late night place like this, and it's pretty impressive, not expensive, and in my neighbourhood. The decor was average (it's obviously not fancy) and we heard that the third floor patio was the best place to be, so we went up there. It wasn't THAT crowded for late-sh on a Friday night (although people started to come in from bars in the area later on) and was actually pretty sweet for a date, which is what myself & my boyfriend were on. I would normally rate it 3 stars but I am giving it four because a) the service was actually REALLY good, above average, in my opinion. (This is based on one visit, but I was very impressed!) And b) The pasta that I had was AMAZING. It was penne carbonara, and it was honestly one of the best pastas I have ever had. (I have tried a lot of different types of pasta!)   Not cheap cheap, but not expensive either. Worth the price, in my opinion. I will be going here again, and having a late night mimosa. I really enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"Best after hours restaurant in Toronto. They serve the same food 24 hours a day. From pastas to dishes like chilli or appetizers like hummus. All the food is fresh. They have a good selection of desserts. And of course there is booze. Skip Fran's or Golden Griddle for 7 west."}
{"text":"This place has always been one of my favorite spots in Toronto. How can you beat \"Open 24/7\"   This is my 4th time here , always dinner. I have yet to get bad food. Service is questionable. Sometimes you'll get the nicest server and other times, you get a 19yr old that feels far too superior to remember being asked for a fork. +_0 wierdddddddd. Brushetta & the hummus dips are my favorite apps here.  I love the pesto pizza. It comes with a lovely salad thats got chicpeas and green peppers :D desert - Carrot Cake -The most delicious organic Carrot Cake EVER!.  note: They have a really good early grey tea here. I'm a huge tea drinker so It was a brand I was not familiar with. To my surprise, it was delicious. The aroma was perfect and you can tell it was fresh. No dry gingery aftertaste.    The feel of the place is perfect for ANY occassion, so you really cant go wrong. Don't go in here expecting a 5 star type of deal. Its a low key, casual, hip, chilling place with good quality of food.   M."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (2nd floor) around the same time (post midnight), and on both occasions the experience was good. The decor was nice on the eye, the lighting dim (perfect for the time we were there) and the music selection was catchy.  The menu is authentic and original and the items were made and presented well. They were definitely generous with their portions and the service was definitely on point. The staff was friendly and courteous (especially considering that it was around 3am), and made sure to ask us on numerous occasions how the experience was going. They also clarified any questions we had about the menu/place.  Out of the 6 items we ordered on aggregate from both visits we only had an issue with one (pasta) and thats only because it didn't live up to the expectations from the first time we ordered it!  I gave it four stars because I think they could do more to arrange the seating in a better manner and also because I think the menu could use a revamp (not food wise but the actual design).  I would definitely visit again and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good meal 24/7."}
{"text":"Had a work lunch recently. My colleague got the philly cheese steak and said it was good. I got a veggie pasta (with a tomato sauce and feta, olives and peppers - the first pasta on the menu). It was tasty and nice and warm - just what I was looking for. The service was ok - a bit slow for lunch time and we were seated all the way upstairs in the roof top patio so that might be why it took them longer to get to us. I would come back and try it again. It is a really nice and cozy place."}
{"text":"I've been to 7 west several times and they've all been decent.  The food portions are large and the flavors are generally good, but I find that the dishes are usually very salty. Today we ordered the penne arrabiata and a pepperoni pizza. The penne dish was flavourful and spicy but a bit too salty for my taste. The pizza was just okay but my partner liked the addition of basil in the pizza.   I like the overall decor of the place,  it's very cozy and intimate. Of course it is also nice that they are always open. I came here once on Christmas eve and it was so cute and nicely decorated with Christmas lights. I think this a good place for a date or a night out with friends. The prices are reasonable and the ambience is very nice, the food is more on the \"just okay\" side."}
{"text":"Good spot to come for drinks on a weeknight. There were lots of very cozy places to sit. The lighting is dim which adds to the coziness. We didn't order food. The menu was filled with standard appetizers; good for sharing. Our waitress was really nice and knew when to check on us. This is a great place to come with friends to catch-up."}
{"text":"*Cake update*  I've been so busy sipping on Baileys hot chocolate, blueberry teas, and delightful steamers at 7 West... I have let months go by without ordering cake!   As a responsible and health-conscious adult, I decided to make up for lost time (with some help).  * Dad's chocolate cake * Moist dark chocolate layer cake with vanilla frosting. The frosting wasn't too sweet and complimented the chocolate perfectly. They have a mom's chocolate cake which has chocolate icing instead... I like the mixed cake, it's more of an experience.  * Carrot Cake * Tasty and very sweet. It's hard to believe that those carrots could have been part of a nutritious diet.  I'm sure there are vitamins in that cake....somewhere.... beneath the blanket of cream cheese icing.  * Dulce De Leche Cheescake * I adore cheesecake. I adore dulce de leche sauce all over cheesecake. Eat this. Wait no! Bring me some and then go get your own.    On another note:  The top floor gets almost unbearably hot in the winter when the heat is cranked. I would try to sit on the second floor unless you like to sweat while you eat. Also, I think the third floor is the make-out floor. So, I guess sit wherever you fancy.  Different strokes, different folks as they say."}
{"text":"Back again to give it another try, big improvements great tuna melt!  Great choice for a good late night meal."}
{"text":"This is a good place to drop by for a quick bite in a cozy, relaxed atmosphere. Although the food is nothing to write home about, it's reliably consistent and reasonably priced.   7 West is also open 24/7 and has lots of seating space on all three floors. Apparently there is a rooftop patio but I have never made it that far.  A solid restaurant serving pizza, pasta, salads and sandwiches, which happens to be conveniently located near the Manulife Centre and Panasonic Theatre."}
{"text":"The Good of 7 West:  1. Service. The staff are actually super trendly here (my word for trendy AND friendly). 2. Menu. There is tons of choice here. While not everything is fantastic, you can have breakfast all day long! 3. Atmosphere. Young, trendy crowd - people are here very late at night.  The Bad of 7 West:  1. Space. You are crammed into a small section with strangers while you eat your meal and God-forbid you need to go to the bathroom. I suggest holding it in because you will have a hard time not disrupting the people around you.  I would honestly eat here more often if it wasn't for my above negative comment. I think it's a great place, I just prefer not to be that close to people while I dine!  Go try it out if you're not claustrophobic!"}
{"text":"7 West Cafe is a gem in the Yonge/Bloor area with a warm and cozy ambience. I decided to finally write a review for this place, because I think a restaurant is worth a good review when you've been 5+ times and always leave satisfied. What keeps me coming back? Read on...  THE GOOD: - This place is open 24/7. Let that sink in: 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This is huge, Yelp friends. Whether you're looking for a cute date spot, a place to catch up with friends, or somewhere to end off your night in the wee hours of the morning, 7 West Cafe will fit the bill. I even saw someone studying there last night. - I would best describe the menu as \"gastropubby\" - you have options for pita pizzas, pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, and all day breakfast. Last night, I went with the mac 'n cheese with bacon, and it was one of the best mac 'n cheese dishes I've ever had (a close tie with the one at Local 1794 in the Danforth/Coxwell area). It was super cheesy, a generous portion size, and who can say no to bacon on top?  - The desserts at 7 West are heavenly - particularly the cakes. Make sure to try a slice of the red velvet cheesecake (I hope you aren't counting calories today!).   THE BAD:  - I'm docking one star as the main dishes here can be a bit of a hit and miss. My friend got the grilled cheese and was a little disappointed - it wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great either. If you want to play it safe, take my advice above and go with the mac 'n cheese!  For me, 7 West is the perfect spot for those long, overdue visits with my girlfriends - and given that it's open 24/7, we know we have all the time in the world to catch up."}
{"text":"Good food, very friendly staff, and great atmosphere. It didn't stand out as a fantastic place, but it was a really nice experience."}
{"text":"FatCat know difference between fake smile and real smile.  Let FatCat explain..  FatCat go on date with Princess Lady at 7 west. Princess Lady seem like she really into FatCat at first..

Mr. Owner, please take advice from Mr Owner from  StockYards and keep live cows in backyard of store for fresh beef. Burgers at your store taste like mixing of mouse meat and sawdust.  - no beers on tap"}
{"text":"I come here too much. I work late shifts and I like having the option to have real food that isn't a noodle The experience here can either be messy drunk people, or intimate hipster types. Its NEVER boring though. The cake selection is DEEEEEELISH. It is my favorite part of the whole menu. Only complaint I have is the food prices. Can be super steep."}
{"text":"Surprisingly an okay place for munchies after 2AM where most places are closed.  24 Hours a Day! Everyday.  The waitress was very enthusiastic at 3AM in the morning explaining each of the cakes they offered. We tried the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake which was amazing by far one of the best desserts I've had in a while! Also we tried the Belgium Chocolate cake which was too much chocolate in my opinion should've went with the carrot cake choice instead.  The Nachos were really appetizing and the sloppy joes mix on top is a must try, even though did not look at good at all but worth it!   Overall This place probably one of the better places to dine in to thats open all the time!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times. It's a good spot, that's open 24/7! Whether it's after a good night of dancing, or just to chill with friends, this place is pretty cool.  It's like a old house with three floors and dim lights!   It's usually pretty loud, so my friend and I had trouble hearing one another.  The pita pizza is alright, I usually spend around $20 dollars here.   I like it because it offers more of a variety then what my friends and I usually get after partying, which is burritos or pho.   The service wise is kinda slow, took about 20 - 25 mins to serve, my friend and I, water.   The crowd ranges from uni/college students to people in their 30s. It's a chill out spot.  However, for food wise.. there's nothing really special about it, the menu consist of things I could make myself when i'm not lazy.   Washroom is pretty tiny and crammed, but clean."}
{"text":"Situé à 2 min de Yonge and Bloor le 7 West Café offre une ambiance intime et relaxante. La restauration est plutôt axée pizza, salade et pâtes et la qualité est au rdv.  Located  at 2 min from Yonge and Bloor the 7 West Café offers an intimate and relaxing atmosphere. The dishes here are mainly pizzas, salads and pasta and the quality is definitely there."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and drinks earlier this week. As others have mentioned, the interior is pretty wonderful. It kind of reminds me of being in the world of Harry Potter. It's cozy and warm and dimly/romantically lit. I ordered the bruschetta and then a chicken sandwich. Pretty basic orders, but both were really delicious actually. Service was friendly and prompt. The black leather couch on the third floor is my favourite spot. I see why this was rated the best first date place in Toronto a few years ago. Anyhow, I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I love 7 west. I used to go there often when I lived downtown, but mostly for their  bitings, desserts and drinks. The ambiance is what makes me keep going back. However, on a most recent visit, I must say the quality of food has changed over the years. The 7 west platter was still great. But their main dishes were not good at all. I ordered the vegetarian chili and honestly it tasted like they had opened a bottle of prego sauce and used that as the base. My friend ordered the penne and had about 4 bites before giving up on it. I think this is a great place for coffees etc., but perhaps not a main meal."}
{"text":"I have come to this cafe at all times of the day and night for every type of meal possible, breakfast, dinner, lunch, a late afternoon coffee, brunch, after a night out, before a night out , so on and so forth.  The quality of food should not be compared to best Italian fine dinning in the city or the best burger joints or the best cafes, that is not what 7 West is here for. The food is more than adequate for its purpose, I especially enjoy the diamond and perils cake.    The ambiance varies by time of day, but is generally more bistro than cafe.   The service is alway quite good."}
{"text":"I go here different times just for the banana chocolate cake alone, my absolute favourite cake in the city. The sandwiches and pastas, though slightly generic, are also decently good. The staff quite often leaves something to be desired, but I have a hard time faulting them when the place is open 24/7. The atmosphere is cozy, candlelit, and romantic, including a \"love note\" desk, an iconic element of the cafe definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"At the end of a night of debauchery and drinking it usually comes down to 7 West or Fran's for me and my friends. However, more and more recently we've been ditching the (still Toronto classic) Fran's and making our way a little further North to this creaky 3 story restaurant in the Bay/Bloor area. I love this building: it's dimly lit, creaky wood everywhere, steep inaccessible stairwells, weird uncomfortable sloping walls, and all awesome. Haha, it's got character. The food is great for sharing or by yourself. I've tried many of the appetizers from the poutine (hey! it's poutine) to the salads and dips and they're all pretty great. Pizza and pasta dishes stand out as high points here and it's what I usually order. The Mac and Cheese in particular is pretty great if you're feeling like a more creamy smooth Mac and Cheese.  Once or twice I've come here just for Coffee and dessert and the cake has been pretty good. You're getting a lot of quantity, but the freshness and quality is not quite the same as some places. Good, but not necessarily worth coming here for that alone...unless it's 3 in the morning and it's between this or apple pie at Fran's. Then it's a toss-up!  Probably a 4 on the strength of the food alone, but the fact that I can come get that food here in the middle of the night any day of the week and not have to worry about spending too much pushes this place into 5 territory. Will definitely be back here again...repeatedly."}
{"text":"A quaint little place a colleague recommended, easily passed over as another house on the street if you're not looking closely. The three-storey restaurant is not wheelchair accessible, the stairs are steep, and the seating is small. Nonetheless, it's got cute decorations with a rustic feel. Each floor seems to have a theme and caters to a slightly different kind of audience. The first floor - quick and casual patrons that can't be bothered to go up a floor; second - more relaxed patrons looking for a drink to accompany their meal; third - quiet and classic space, good for a chat with one or two friends. As we went up the floors to find a good table, we were greeted by the waitress on each floor. On the third we were told there's also a patio area! The roofed patio is almost like the inside of a cottage/garden house - it's a little bit chillier (heat lamps in place if needed)?but there's ample natural sunlight.  Walking in you notice signage indicating 7 West is open 24/7, which got me hopeful for a reliable and diverse menu that could make it a convenient stop if I'm in the area at any time. I wasn't disappointed by their lunch options, so I'm looking forward to returning at a different time of day to compare.   The menu is simple with a fairly wide selection - pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, coffees, wines, and desserts. A traditional casual Italian cuisine that looked fairly authentic. Prices were reasonable for the portion,  being in Yorkville I would even say it's a good deal.  Lunchtime has lunch-size pastas with a starter house salad - the portion was perfect for one meal. The salad was regular - nothing special and a decent portion. The pesto pollo penne was flavourful and the pesto was tasty. The chicken wasn't too dry thanks to the olive oil from the pesto. It was a good ratio of pasta and sauce so I was satisfied."}
{"text":"This is another Toronto landmark that USED to be incredible (an easy 5-stars).  Unfortunately, in recent years, 7 West stopped paying attention to the little details that truly made it a gem.  Open 24 hours, tons of great desserts, and a deathly dope space, 7 West has definitely got the formula right.  Their appetizers are still fantastic (who doesn't want hummus and nachos at 3am?), but the meals have started to fall off a bit (ie, cheap buns make bad sandwiches).  A few friends, apps, drinks and a nice slice of cheesecake for the road, 7 West might not own the same charm that it once did, but it's still a decent spot to share some time with the crew."}
{"text":"What a cool concept. A 24/7 place that serves fantastic food and has the ambiance that one would pay top dollar for.   Loved it. Everything was good (including the portions). Go there already"}
{"text":"I went there twice. The second time was only to confirm if it really was that bad and yes it was.  Service was terrible. I waited to be greeted. I waited to be seated. Waited to be given menus and had to wait even longer to have our orders taken. Didn't see my water anywhere in sight after having asked for it se time ago.   The staff is not friendly but maybe they are going for some hipster vibe which I don't get as there were only 2 young ladies working there.   Asked for a something in my mail to be substituted. She suggested soup as a replacement. When I asked what kind, she said it was canned soup. It definitely was from a tin which I could have had at home.  Second round: just don't even ask. I confirm I will not return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 15 years, .  The first time was with a new friend Scott (RIP), Scott introduced me to this place (and a few other thing:)). And I've been here with  just about everyone else I know including, Kevin, Perry, Eddie, Jimmy, and most recently it has become a late night meeting place with my newest friend Jacob and now Jett.  I have always only order the tuna melt with salad. As boring as that sounds the tuna melt is amazing here when they get it right most times (sometimes they miss the mark), a bit expensive, but given the location and being open 7-24 hours, I'm sure this place isn't cheap to run. I've always enjoyed it, but that could be because the company has always been the best. :) If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out on a Toronto institution that has always managed to stay current."}
{"text":"Interesting and ample choices for a 24 hour place.  My boyfriend and I made our way here a few times even though it's at the other end of the city from his place.  We come for the late night digs because it's the best you can  get after 1 am onward.  He's a foodie and loves the pita \"pizza\" (even though sometimes it's undercooked...an easy fix) and the almost deconstructed caesar salad.  I lean on the dessert side of things and love the cheese cake which comes as a hearty slice.  It's not conventional in terms of savoury foods so don't go expecting something Frans-esque.  It's a unique dining experience you won't find elsewhere in the city.  By the way: The seats are ultra uncomfortable... bring an extra sweater to sit on. You're welcome."}
{"text":"7 West could have easily become my favorite hangout as I live right next to it. But the staff and service has pushed me to ban this from my list. I have had to walk out twice with my date after being seated at the most awkward table because of the large crowd. Last time was really bad. There was a great table for three in the corner and we asked for it but the waitress gruffly pushed us into a two seat table in the middle of the room saying that they were saving it for groups of three. Right after we sat down a couple came and the waitress seated them at that table although there were other two seaters available.  I have had similar experiences twice and do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Cute little Cafe : ) This place is really adorable and serves pretty good food. A guy took me here on a date and I have to say I had such a great experience with the ambiance and the food that I came back and took my roommate, my good friend from out of town and my two sisters haha  It's a really artsy style cafe with artsy fartsy servers livening up the place with their cool personalities. The cafe is pretty small so it'd be hard to accommodate a large group of people but if the restaurant gets crowded, don't worry there are three floors just in case. It's very laid-back and friendly, and just a cool restaurant to visit.   I came here and ordered mainly the pastas, burgers, and the cakes. The sauces for the pastas are really yummy (I would recommend the penne pastas). I had a burger two times in a row because it's just so darn delicious : p It comes with a refreshing house salad which is undoubtedly one of the best salads I've had in my life and I have to say it's tossed with pieces of bell peppers in them...I hate bell peppers but 7 West Cafe makes it work! You also have the option of adding aged cheese for $3 more which I said \"what the hey, why not\" and it made the burger 100x more delicious : ) Lastly, don't get me started on the desserts....my roommate ordered a slice of cake, sadly I forgot the name but, I only took half a teaspoon full of the cake (cause I didn't wanna be a moocher) but DAMN it tasted soooo good. I was literally dying in my chair watching her eat the rest of it. : p  The environment is relaxed and friendly, the food is OH-SO-DELCIOUS, and the servers are like these cool people you wish were you're friends : p  The only reason I gave 7 West Cafe a 4 out of 5 stars was because the prices are pretty expensive which, for a student, isn't the best thing.  BUT whenever I do have a bit of extra spending money, I always make sure to come back again : )"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by 7 west. It had a very mellow and casual atmosphere for any type of outting: Catchups w friends, date, venting session, whatever you need! Very widespread selection for decent pricing, what can go wrong? It's as central as I gets so it's definitely worth a try! Food is a good sized portion- friends cheesecake was a great presentation. Seating is a comfortable and cozy setup- I personally like the window seats the best!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went here for some appetizers and drinks on the first night of our vacation. Everything was super yummy and was very well portioned. The prices were not bad at all! The atmosphere was cozy and cute, just as a cafe should be! But, if you don't like a chatty and loud atmosphere, and would rather have a relaxed and romantic dinner, this probably isn't for you. We loved it, and I was singing along and bopping my head to every song that came on!! Our server was very nice, and although you could tell that the servers have a chaotic job, serving multiple floors of people in a tiny space, we got A+ service and wonderful food. Would come back again and would recommend to anyone looking for good food in a cute atmosphere with a social / bar-type setting."}
{"text":"Seven West is an interesting alternative if you are looking for an atmospheric place to hang out in the after hours.   The 24 hour concept sets it apart.    I come here if have insomnia and/or  I am just craving Penne Arrabiata at 3:00 AM.  It offers an alternative place to swoon with a date, after last call and when everything else in the area is closed.  Hopefully you will not have any problems with old church pews being used for seating in a restaurant (2nd Floor) .  Choose your favorite of the 3 floors, each with its own distinct atmosphere.      The concept is perhaps bit dated for 2014 .  The rather artsy-bohemian staff can be quite attentive or alternatively disinterested and slow."}
{"text":"First off it took forever to get a table here and when we were finally seated our server on the first floor was  horrible and asked my gf in an incredibly rude way to remove her gift from the table so he could slam down our water.  He never came back and we sat down for about 15 minutes with our hands up, until we eventually got fed up and left to find seats on the 3rd floor.  Never experienced such bad service in Toronto in ages!   Service was a bit better but about the same.  Angry looking servers that acted like they didn't want to be there and never once came back to check on us or refill our drinks.  I ordered the sloppy jo and what can I say.  I paid about $20 for hamburger helper on a tiny bun with a salad.  They also forgot to put dressing on my salad, but I didn't bother waving a server down because that would have taken another half hour.    To top things off I saw a large insect crawling on the floor upstairs and my friend also noticed this disgusting creature.  Could not believe how this place got such great reviews.  I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"Very classy place that also features 7$ breakfast betwen 7-10 on weekdays. Naturally my partner and I decided to indulge on Friday as I had a late start for work.   I saw from the signs that the place was 24 hours and expected a diner vibe but when you walk in the place js very nicely and tastefully decorated. I wouldn't even be skeeved coming out here at 4 am. The menu looks like a nice selection of wraps and sandwiches. The breakfast was very good. Eggs, bacon, homefries and toast! Can't complain.   Recommended"}
{"text":"Having been to 7 west a lot in my life one thing never changes the charming funhouse like atmosphere of trying to get to the top floor and get a table.  The staff are always pretty good, very considerate.  The food shifts a lot as it must be difficult to find a good chef for 24-7 restaurant.  The penne arrabiata used to be my fave, now it's just ok. The coffee is good as are the apps and desserts. It's fairly romantic and the drinks are nice."}
{"text":"Many use \"cozy\" or \"intimate\" to describe 7 West but I would say \"squished\" is more accurate.  Met a girlfriend here for post work drinks and a snack. We arrived early in the evening and the waiters were very attentive but the noticed that service started to drop.  We were seated in a corner near the window on the 2nd floor.  We shared one order of the nachos, which appeared to be a large slop of stuck together chips. It's OK, we forcefully used knives to get pieces apart. The jalapenos were a nice touch, I guess.  While getting ready to leave, our bill seemed to take forever to arrive. I think it is difficult for the staff to maintain service when they are dashing up and down 3 flights of stairs. EIther way, the candle-lit ambience didn't quite convince me to return..."}
{"text":"Love, love LOVE this place! I came here with my girl friend and we were offered a candlelit dinner on the second floor, which was a really romantic setting.  For a place that runs 24/7, I can't complain about the really good pizza and greek salad I consumed that night. My friend enjoyed her beef burger and fries.  My girl, who isn't a fan of cake, was drawn to the chocolate banana cake. I am crazy for desserts, but I felt more drawn to the Belgian Double chocolate cake. We ended up choosing the skinnier choice, which was to share one slice of the chocolate banana cake. The waitress graced us with a YUUUGE slice.  Boy, was that not only decadent, but delicious!  (regret not taking pix!) We ate ALL of it...except one bite.   I am so sick of cakes at subpar places being days old and dried out; this cake was worth every delicious morsel.  The prices are a little steep for some things ($4.00 for a Gingerale...really? and $12 for hummus and dip...?) but the cakes are worth it and so are the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Very romantic and calm atmosphere. The food was very good and the service was fast. Definitely would return but it is kind of expensive for the portions you get."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with a friend one evening. It had free parking right outside because it was a Sunday evening. We went to the second level and it was dimly lit and not very loud. The level is very small and intimate. It has the washroom on this floor too if you have a small bladder. We were promptly served and ordered a glass of wine. My pinot grigio wasn't too dry or sweet which is just how I like it. For dinner I got the mac and cheese. It was a huge portion and I honestly couldn't finish it. It had a bit of a sour taste that I didn't really care for. I think if it was smaller I would have been ok. Still not bad. My friend got nachos and it was a good size portion as well.  They've got lots of options available and it's great if you have cravings at 3am and don't want diner food although they do have all day breakfast if that's what you want. I didn't feel that I had to rush and leave as some places push you to get your bill as soon as you're done eating. I'd definitely come back. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Located around the corner of Yonge and Charles, lies a odd-looking, three-tier building that resembles nothing like a restaurant. In fact it looks really sketchy that only the two signs holding up the place outside shows that it is a restaurant that's 24 Hours. That could probably tell you that for a 24-hour establishment, everything needs to be sketchy on the outside to compensate what lies within.  The interior is just reminds me of old Victorian-esque or where my aunt used to live when I was young and remembered how much set of stairs that house has. (Which in the past I had always climb up to the attic to play games and fear of the empty rooms on other floors. It just brings that nostalgic feeling of that old, ominous, and lovely back to me from wooden floors, screechy stairs to fans spinning above you and I thank 7 West Cafe for that.   Aside from that, the theme of what I'm getting at is very romantic and I guess couples love this lively feeling of going to a cramp and tall place with dim lights and candles glore.   Anyways, the menus consists of Italian dishes, sandwiches and all-day breakfast which for a 24-Hour establishment is totally ideal for a soon-to-be drunk (like me) that would one day find this place as his saviour. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich that includes a side order of chips (which I find weird considering almost every place serves fries) and while it tasted good, the consistency of the pulled pork itself was somewhat rough at times, it did not melt in your mouth like what pulled pork actually does. The chips were lays chips.   At that time, there wasn't any tap on beers and I have to order these smaller bottles (if I wasn't mistaken, Stella bottles were bigger) of Stella which costs $6.50. It was somewhat a rip though I guess its standard. I also had several shots of Jacks and rum and coke which all totals to about $35 bucks worth of booze. I did not feel drunk at the end to my dismay but I might next time.   The service was friendly and attentive though my server/bartender eventually left due to her shift being over and I was going to give her the tip instead of the night shift which came. However it seems that - as a cramp place - at that time, servers are constantly moving people off tables or splitting them and it was somewhat a headache to me (not due to my intoxication).   However, this is THE saving grace for drunks like me at midnight where most if not all places aren't avaliable."}
{"text":"It would be unfair to not give a 5/5 to a \"cafe\" that is open 24/7, serves decent food, has prime location and amazing interior design! I don't think anyone comes here for serious food though, it is a casual option after all."}
{"text":"When I come to 7 West, I always feel like I'm on a really bad date from the early 90's. Wait-- maybe the food is just really boring and uninspired coffee-house-ish stuff. I feel likeI'm trying to sit through an insufferable conversation with a guy who is staring at my boobs and Bush singing 'Everything's Zen' in the background. Wait? What do you mean I can't smoke in here? This is 2014? How do you expect me to get through this date without cigarettes and beer?  I was split on the notion of a place that is open 24/7. Knowing the industry as I do this means:  A) A place where the food is super fresh and they run out of things quite often and the servers know the menu well because there are so many shifts to work that they know everything there like the back of their hand.  or   B) A place that has lots of old, stale leftover shit that they try to sell before the fresh stuff comes in because there are actually people there to eat the leftover crap and servers who are either so tired of working so many long hours that they just don't give a shit or so many different shifts to cover that the servers have no clue and don't give a shit.  Hm. Well... from my experiences, it's a little more of the latter. The food is barely mediocre and features a lot of things that I made at home when I was first learning to cook. In the 90's.  Pizza, Lasagna, salad with steak on it... A little uninspired for food I have to pay for. But it that's what you like-- that's fine. It's not what I like. Food often appears at the table and is cold. Cold lasagna is gross.   Service varies with time of day and while I do understand that this is partially unavoidable, I've never been impressed with the service. They always seem to go missing.  Anyway, the ambiance is ok. I don't love the tiny iron and wood tables, but the stained glass is nice. Desserts are hot or miss and it depends on what time of day you get there. I've had a very stale piece of chocolate cake here that my server reluctantly took off the bill.  I just don't come here anymore and probably won't in the future."}
{"text":"great food! I would definitely go back although the waiter was not that attentive. He was friendly nonetheless but he never came back and asked if we were alright or wanted anything else, and our food took a long time, in their defense it was very busy. I also ordered a latte that came to me as a cappuccino. It was very trendy and urban and overall enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"Really cute place! Came here on a Sunday evening and it was decently packed. It's basically a 3-storey house and you can choose which floor you want to be seated at, given that it's not too busy. It is a little squishy though, so probably not a good idea for big groups. The menu is extensive so it took my friends and I quite a while for us to choose our dishes. We ended up getting the nachos platter, which was about $15 but so worth the price because it was huge! There were a variety of toppings (guac included) and we really liked it because it wasn't oily at all.   For our mains, we got pastas, a personalized pizza and the omelette (they have all-day breakfast). The penne carbonara, penne chicken and penne arrabiata were all very yummy. All the portions were huge and most of us ended up having to save our food. The only downside is service is a little bit slow.   Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went last night for a late night drink & snack and was greeted with a waitress who seemed super annoyed. Our bartender was really sweet and made great drinks, but the original waitresses attitude was brutal. Customer service is important, you're a 24hr cafe, what was with the attitude at 11pm?"}
{"text":"Been going here for years because it has so much to offer whether its dinner, coffee & desert, or late night chow. Above all the ambiance here is one of a kind; stained glass decor by candle light with dark wooden benches, chairs, and tables. It definitely creates a \"mood\".   Three floors of a converted home linked by a narrow stairway gives it a sort've old world charm that's hard to come by this side of the pond.   Everyone I introduce to this place becomes a new regular so what does that tell ya?"}
{"text":"Open 24/7, this joint is divided into three different and uniquely decorated levels. I ate on the main floor, which had an exposed brick wall and lots of wood, so it's quite a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately I sat at a table with pews as chairs and they were not comfortable. My dining mate and I were shifting non-stop and if we sat properly, we were too far apart to converse.  I had the steak philly with a side salad. It was nothing to wrote home about. Very standard, if not a little overpriced. The vanilla chocolate cake was dry and flavourless, so I'd recommend trying a different dessert.   The service was typical. They don't do out of their way to make you feel valued or special.  In a pinch, I might go back, but it's not worth being a destination point."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Not too expensive, extremely cozy, friendly service. My friend introduced me to the place about a year ago and I loved it. The atmosphere in particular - dim lighting, candles at the table, water served in pretty bottles - they really pay attention to the details. The menu is diverse and extensive, yet I always get a mac and cheese (such creamy goodness! Though the aged cheese taste if not for everyone, I warn you). In my experience, the servers are generally laid back and very warm. The 24/7 service never hurts either. The desserts (cakes!) look charming but I have yet to order them...I hope to do so in due time :)"}
{"text":"While the food is good, it's definitely not worth the price point. There are many other late night places you can order from that will give you far more value for your money.   If you do find yourself here, head on upstairs for a cozy place to eat, there are many comfortable seating options that are great for a date or chat with a friend. Highly recommend the poutine and freshly squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"I feel really bad giving 7 West 2 stars as it used to be my go-to spot when I was a bartender in Toronto and needed some good eats after work.  However, on a recent trip to Toronto, I went twice in the same week and had the same  experience both times.  The first time I went, it was around 8ish in the evening.  We asked to sit upstairs on the patio.  Then we sat for a good 25 minutes before anybody brought us menus.  We actually saw a couple come in, eat, pay and leave before we even received our food.  Unacceptable.  Every time we tried to get one of the server's attention, they would give us the \"just a minute\" finger and head back downstairs.  The second time I went, it was late... like 3am.  Again, we sat and waited at least 20 minutes before receiving menus.  The place wasn't even busy.  I ordered a coffee and it never came.  I actually had to ask for it again when my food came (which I ordered separately after ordering my coffee) and then it finally came--lukewarm.  Ultimately, the server took it off the bill without me asking.  The food is mediocre and the service stinks.  I love the hummus and the all day/all night breakfast but I probably wouldn't order much else.  They blast the music a little too much in the wee hours for the drunken bar/nightclub crowd.  If the place wasn't open 24/7, I probably would have given it one star."}
{"text":"Went there 4 am after a party. The server is nice, the food is great. It's probably the only restaurant around that is 24/7. It's simply amazing."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great location, great atmopsphere, and great food!  What more could you want?! A little pricey - but the portions are big.  My Rosie Ravioli (stuffed with cheese and asaparagus, in a blush sauce) was wonderful.  13 bucks, and I was stuffed! Well...not so stuffed that I couldn't have a slice of the dulce de leche cheesecake, which was also fab!!   Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is 24 hours and the service at 4 am was awesome we got seated right away and out  food came out very quickly.its great also for large groups,and the pastas are all amazing!!"}
{"text":"Cute place, but a little on the crammed side. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big group. The food is average (nachos are delicious!) but not spectacular about this place other than it being 24/7."}
{"text":"I was shocked to find out I had never written a review about this place. Specially, taking into consideration I have been coming to this Cafe for over 15 years. Perhaps as a subconscious attempt to keep 7 West as little known as possible?   Alas, the point of writing reviews for Yelp is to share the love and not keep little gems like this to myself. Hence here you are, reading my words.   As I have said before, people go to different places for different reasons as restaurants may be good for some things and not others. For example, in the years I have been coming here, I have only have had dinner or lunch a handful of times. 'Why?' You ask? Simple. The menu, which is mostly Fusion, with an Italian and Middle Eastern bent does not inspire me, plus it is marginally pricey for the type of food you get.   I dare say that there is nothing wrong with the menu but I am the type of person who really looks forward to having a good meal. One that I would be intrinsically looking forward to having. Simply put, 7 West does not inspire that in me.   I will however drop by for an appetizer (Hummus) or for various types of coffees. Many times I may have dropped by for a glass Red or I might drop by for a beer, although it is worth mentioning they only sell it by the bottle, no pints. Desserts are also good too although selection does vary. Service levels are good. I never had an issue.   So why do I like this place so much? The decor. Seriously, this place looks awesome at night, candle light reflecting off the exposed brick, the sort of Gothic vibe on the third floor... Oh, did I mention that? This place has three storeys to choose from.   The lower floor is meant to be the quiet one, working its way to the top floor which is arguably the loudest. Although you can easily hold a conversation so it is not particularly loud.   There is also the location! I have friends all over Toronto and this joint is literally central, being just a few minutes walk south from Yonge and Bloor, so it makes it the perfect place for a small get together.   Plus: The place is open 24/7."}
{"text":"Love the music, the drinks, the food.  Great scene inside, usually very busy.  Definite first date stop.  Their martinis are fabulous...I remember many a birthday party wandering home in a pleasant state.  Love it, haven't gone in a while but now I must!"}
{"text":"I spent literally 80 minutes for waiting my food. Yea of course the server took our order but he forgot :) we waited and waited to check again whether the food is coming or not but he wouldnt come to us because this place is sooooo fcking busy and full. And you know what. Someone stole my new precious wallet that was inside of my bag right under my seat. Of course the serve said \"i dont know? i didnt see anyone\" Never going back."}
{"text":"I literally grew up in the building on the same street and next block and never went here and now I really regret it.   What a cute spot!   Pluses:  -Cute -24Hrs  -Bar, Cafe AND food -outside/inside little patio thing -Extremely central  The waiters aren't the friendliest and with only a few people they don't tend to be the nicest to you in terms of finding a nice spot to seat you but it's so so cute and nice.   However there's not that much option. But that's ok because it's so cute."}
{"text":"There are two levels to this cafe and I love the hushed, darkened vibe in the lower lever (haven't been to the second floor yet)  The food selection is ok. But I really didn't like how slow the service was. That was the most memorable thing: no food on my table since I ordered 30-40min ago. So not sure if I'm really coming back..."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - most recently about a week ago.  I feel this place is slowly getting worse.  We dined before the theatre on a weekday evening and were jammed into a table on the main floor - I don't remember it being so crowded.  Between the loud music and our loud neighbours, we had a hard time conversing.  Service wasn't great - we said we were trying to make an 8pm show which apparently slowed down the server.  We also seemed to have more than one person looking after us.  Food was pretty good although when did it get so expensive?  Two of us had pasta dishes (lasagna was great), one had the tuna melt which wasn't bad and the other a cobb salad which looked incredibly unappetizing.  Overall, seems to be on the decline which is a shame.  It's a great 24/7 restaurant but it seems to be lacking on service, quality and affordability these days.."}
{"text":"Brunch! A relatively small place where each floor features different decor. We got a nice window seat where we could watch the snow fall--I think it would have been great for couples. The tea didn't come with a teapot of hot water, but the server was happy enough to refill our mugs.  We were seated beneath a speaker, which was a bit annoying, but they were able to turn the volume down for us.   I had the waffle topped with fruit. The server informed me it was the newest thing on the menu and one of her favourites and I can see why. The waffle was nicely flavourful and well cooked--not too crispy and not too soft. The waffle was piled with fruit--strawberries, blueberries, and caramelized bananas. I really enjoyed that the bananas were not just slices and they took the extra time to make them super tasty.   One of my dining partners ordered their house breakfast and the plate was super full--so a pretty good deal. I sampled some of the home fries and they were up to snuff. My other dining partner had an omelet with side salad--both had good portions and the salad had a nice assortment of things other than lettuce, like chickpeas!   Overall a pretty reasonable place for brunch and the service was good."}
{"text":"7 West, a bit of a strange joint, kind of Janus-faced .... half the week (Sun-Wed) in the evenings it is a relaxed, chill place great for reading or discussions. In other words, an actual cafe. The other half? It's a bar, plain and simple - loud (great music though) and crowded.   The service is pretty good, and unlike a lot of places in Toronto, it's easy to strike up a conversation with your server - in fact, I would say the biggest plus to the place is that (sorry to say) un-Toronto vibe that allows total strangers to talk to each other. The best part of 7 West is how friendly and open the place can be, servers and customers alike, at any time of day.   While the obvious time to come here is at night, I would recommend coming during the day as well - it's a neat place to hang out.   While the service is good and the atmosphere great, the prices aren't, and the food is passable. I would say the prices are high, especially for what you're getting ($7 for a bottle of Guinness? Really?).   7 West has found a niche, and kudos for them, I say. But I would also say it's unfortunate that it is the only place of its kind in this part of Toronto - we need more places like this, not only for its hours, but the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. I admit I've never eaten a full meal here but the interior is amazing, the staff friendly and the atmosphere is great. It's a laid back, relaxing kind of a place.  Most of my encounters here have been late afternoon meetings or early to late evening desserts (do not visit without buying some cake). Always found a seat. Always loved it. 24 hours makes it a good spot to meet up before or after a night out.  Tip: Most people don't realize the building has multiple floors. Try walking upstairs if you want some quiet."}
{"text":"7 West is a great alternative to the chains & little fast-food places that choke up this section of Yonge.  Comfortable and funky, with an I've-graduated-from-the-Green-Room elegance (nothing against the Green Room bro, except the time they brought me iced tea full of fruit flies & then didn't care when I told them).  It's the kind of place where you can stay half the afternoon, and as long as it's quiet they won't move you.  The food is a simple list of sandwiches, pastas, salads, and other light meals.  My BLT was made with fresh multigrain bread and came with a chickpea and green salad dressed with an assertive vinaigrette.  The cakes looked to die for, but I was being oh so good, so I had a lemon tea and pretended not to look."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this little place and the fact that it's open 24 hours. Great spot for a late night bite or drink. Great food!"}
{"text":"Came here when we missed our reservations for Wish down the street. Solid brunch option with eclectic decor. Would recommend if you are in the area and don't want to wait 1 hour for waffles."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and probably should've expected it to be PACKED on every floor (date night!!!!)  We sat in a tight place on the second floor. Was a bit uncomfortable and might've made it harder for good conversations to occur, especially for the couples beside us.  My friends and I ordered three poutines. They came out fairly quick and were flavourful. The portion was good and filling. However, as many of my other friends have said, you are paying a lot for mediocre food. It was also really hard to read the menu because of how dark it was.  Suggestions  -Increase lighting! Or add more lights around the room if tealights are a hazard -More space between tables"}
{"text":"Really great first date place. It's warm and cozy without being too intimate and casual enough to not scare your date away.  Really enjoyed the third lounge as it felt tucked away and hidden like a prohibition speakeasy and the service was spot on. Not pretentious whatsoever.  Their antipasto was surprisingly good with a pretty big portions and quality prosciutto. On the other hand.. their Nachoes were predictably unspectacular, akin to what you'd get at Sneaky Dee's.  All in all I was impressed and would happily go back."}
{"text":"When all you wanna do is sit down and relax after a late shift from work. One of my favorite places and  no doubt its the best open for 24 hours restaurant in Toronto"}
{"text":"This place is less than a block from my house and open all night.  Amazingly, they have fantastic food as well!  For brunch this AM, I had the 7 West Omelette with a side salad. Deliciouso.   I've been here six or seven times now and the food is consistently good. Service is a bit slow, however it's pretty cool to know there's always  a place I can go for decent grub.  The only negative experience I had was a delivery.  The food arrived lukewarm to cold.  Not pleasant when you've paid $50+ bucks for dinner."}
{"text":"Decent food for a overpriced 24  hour joint, with service very much needs work.  We came to 7 west at 2am which was still peak time for the restaurant on a Sunday.   We had 2 gentlemen servers who were more focused on speaking to eachother then waiting tables, but we're very polite.  THE FOOD: 3/5 Daily soup was cream of mushroom that was strangely enough a bit sour, served with flat bread for some reason?  Nachos were amazing, super large platter topped with delicious pulled pork, tomatoes, cheeze, jalapenos was amazing, highly recommend it.  The Pasta was okay, first he got my order wrong and served me the wrong pasta and then upon serving the right one the noodles were SO unbelievably short and overcooked it looked like chef boyardee canned noodles. The sauce was also too salty. It was served with bread.  THE SERVICE: 2/5 The waiters were nice, but they were so focused on chatting it up behind us (a conversation louder than my table's), we as customers had to come up to hand them our bill.  The food came unnervingly slow, almost 20 minutes, and when the food did come it was the wrong order which meant additional time waiting for the right one.  At the end even getting the bill took a lot of effort to get their attention.   7 west is great because it runs 24/7, I would still love to come for a drink and nachos one day.... If everything else was closed."}
{"text":"This place is my staple for a late night, drink/coffee/dessert. It's a nice unique place to hang out. It's 24 hrs, and they still serve dinner.   The food I find is common, and nothing special, but the desserts are good - some of the cakes are from Dolce. yummm.  They also have speciality drinks. During Christmas time, I once had a hot chocolate with some hazelnut liquor. It was like a liquid ferrero rocher."}
{"text":"I cant believe how slow the service is. Our waitress never took drink orders before dinner. Time she came back to our table we where ready to order dinner. 15 minute wait. The restaurant was slow. She even stood by the stairs and looked at us, but didn't ask if we wanted drinks. Getting the bill was super slow...  I dont think I will recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore and I wont be going back"}
{"text":"The best chicken penne pasta I have ever had. Love the vibe, not to mention the incredibly moist cakes. Perfect for a date night or to catch up with a friend. Absolutely love the staff as well."}
{"text":"I first came to eat here about 12 years ago. Yes I'm dating myself, but as a young man unaccustomed to the pleasures of the 24 hour eatery, I was immediately impressed. It was an Epiphany to me that one could receive any semblance of fresh food at 3:00am as I was used to prepackaged Hoagies at assorted Mac's Milks and 7-11's until this pivotal point in time.   Its a shame to admit that I hadn't been back to 7 West until about a month ago when a friend and I decided to embark on a late night odyssey, yet needless to say old expectations were definitely met and the All Time Breakfast at $10.95, was thoroughly enjoyed. I will be sure to include 7 West on my regular late night food pilgrimages from herein as the ambiance, food, price point and pleasant nocturnal staff make this a place worth visiting."}
{"text":"Yum! We came specifically for the Dulce de Leche cheesecake and coffee \"bowls\" (like The Gilmore Girls might have), and 7 West delivered.   The cheesecake was delicious, and it was a big piece. But for $9, it better be! Unfortunately we didn't think this cheesecake was better than Carole's Cheesecake, which is $7 a slice. But it is probably one of the best cheesecakes you can find in Toronto, if you are determined to indulge.   The atmosphere was great. We went around 9:30 on a Sunday, and had the second floor to ourselves for a while. The music was a bit too loud, so that was sort of intrusive. But we could still hear each other.   Thy have free WiFi, which is great--you just have to ask for the password. I love that it is open 24/7, so you don't have to think about it, but you can just show up.   We also had plain coffee, which was fine for plain coffee, and the Large hot chocolate, which was truly large. It was like a small bowl. It arrived tepid, however, which was disappointing, but it was still fine.  In conclusion, it's a great place to go to for a late-night bit of indulgence, if you just want somewhere to hang out, chat, and nibble on something."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of this place. It's a cozy place to hang out with friends or dates."}
{"text":"Impressive server! Really friendly and politely! The environment is cozy and nice decorated. Good place to have a drink with friends at weekend. And the food portion is very big compared to the \"downtown \" size. I would highly recommend this café:)"}
{"text":"This was my breakfast go to place all Caribana weekend. It seemed to be the only thing open between 4-6am when we would get back to our hotel from the club. And although the omelette may not be the best I'll ever experience in my lifetime, when you're that hungry at that o'clock, they are the greatest things since sliced bread! With a side of homefries that'll make you slap your mama!  Lost one star over finding out they were out of pancakes after we placed our pick up order and arrived at the cafe."}
{"text":"Ordered lasagna as usual. Always been a homerun but today it was cold in the middle. Not cool."}
{"text":"Desert is excellent!! The food is just mediocre. Pasta sauce tasted like store bought. All in all good late night place to stop by for coffee and cakes."}
{"text":"Lots of choice here. It is a fine place to go for a meal if you're in the area. It is also open real late and has a cute space. Great service too. I think I had a grilled cheese here which was actually pretty tasty. If I was in the area, I'd go there again."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot in first and second year. Mostly came here for the set-up (it's three stories) and the ambiance (wooden everything, candles, etc.). It's definitely a student-hub though so be prepared to have to sit across from that guy you worked with in first year econ but haven't spoken to since and have to make awkward eye contact with every now and then."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast at 4am for delivery, it was great! I love that this place is open so early/late"}
{"text":"Discovered this hidden gem recently. Can't believe such wonderful establishment  (24/7) is in my hood and didn't know till now.   It's a very low key place, especially with the construction going on yonge st. It can be easily missed.  They have a pretty good selection of alcohol. The breakfast menu had only 3 items but so many choices from appetizers pizza pasta and sandwich. We were taking forever to decide but ended up going for the sampler appetizer, Which includes the chvre, humus, bruchetta olives, boccocini cheese and pita. Every thing was delicious.  The pita was light with a hint of sweetness. The hummus was smooth and the chvre was a surprise to me- I don't usually like red pepper but whatever they did made this a melt in your mouth yummiest.   For dessert we ordered the red velvet cake to share.  The cream and chocolate was a good balance.   The place has a very cool, casual vibe and the service was fantastic. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"So disappointed to write this review. Went to 7 West yesterday with 4 friends. I had 3 beers and the mac and cheese. The mac was very very bland. About 1/2 through my meal I found a long hair in it :(  I showed it to the server who asked if I wanted a new plate of mac and cheese. I declined. I was quite surprised that there was no offer to comp a beer or dessert or anything. She never mentioned it again. My buddies all had pasta dishes as well. One came out cold and had to be re-heated and 2 of them were bland as well. Epic fail for 7 West. None of us will return."}
{"text":"7 West is popular because its open 24 hours and also because the ambiance of the place very nice. I have been here four times, the food was always good, not great or bad. But the ambiance is what made me come back every time. My favourite things on the menu are probably their Dulce de Leche Cheesecake and their Baileys Lattes."}
{"text":"Cool spot... great food. Especially after hours in a drunken stupor... get some pasta pal"}
{"text":"Tried to sit upstairs at a usual table because it was free but was told to try downstairs instead. There were many seats available but some needed to be cleaned so I said I would wait. The waiter insisted that I check downstairs and I must have said 3 times that I wanted to sit upstairs already. He sat me at a table with a very branchy plant hitting me in the face. I asked to be moved over and the table was moved about an inch, not really fixing anything. I had to get up, and move the plant over myself.   I waited a while to order. My food was good though - I got the primavera.   The price of the food was slightly higher on the receipt than what was on the menu...only realized after though.   Overall, the meal was good but the service was not great at all."}
{"text":"Great place for late night eats especially.   Cool feel to it and good music.   All day breakfast is a favourite as is the 7 West club sandwich.   Service was a bit slow last night but tends to be good enough.  Most dishes are $12-$15. Guess it's a bit more pricey than other late night food spots, but it's still not crazy and the food is good"}
{"text":"3.5/5   Decor: Loved the vibe of this place. It would be a perfect place for a date to be honest. There's three floors and dim lighting. The decor is pretty nice as well but the place was pretty crammed.  Food:  The food was okay. I ordered the \"Pasta what?\" and it wasn't awesome but it wasn't bad. It was just kind of a generic pasta. I also ordered a dessert with my meal, the diamonds and pearls and it was fantastic!   Service:  The service was okay. I actually really liked my waitress she was really nice to us and refilled our water frequently. However, the food kind of came out slower than I would've liked.   Note:  What I absolutely love about this place is that it's opened 24/7! like that's insane! If you're hungry and  can't find a place to eat at 3:30 am in the morning. This would be a place to go."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday breakfast a couple of weeks ago and the experience was sub par. I've been here before and the food has always been just OK.   The restaurant is located in an old house just west of Yonge. It's two stories high, and the dining area on the second floor provides a nice view of the street. The decor is simplistic, wood tables and hardwood floors.  The breakfast menu is pretty standard, eggs and sausage/bacon, pancakes, french toast, etc. I ordered the breakfast bagel and it was HUGE. I was expecting eggs cheese and ham sandwiched between a bagel. What I got was a huge open faced bagel with egg ham and cheese on each and a huge garden salad. There was just too much food (which I know isn't a complaint, but when you're expecting something simple it leads to disappointment). I could barely finish one bagel and the salad itself didn't leave much to the imagination.   The other thing was that from my table, I could see into the kitchen, and was able to watch them prepare my food, which was a little disconcerting. I do have to say though, their one saving grace was when I ordered the mimosa, they brought out the whole mini-champagne bottle, and I'll never complain about too much booze!   It's a good spot for brunch if you're in the area, but if you walk down the street to Wish (just east of Yonge), you'll have a much better meal."}
{"text":"Showed up with 10 people for drinks and dessert.  I had a look at their menu and it looked like that had something for everyones taste.  Their dessert menus is pretty fancy. I did not have any dessert, but a few people ordered some stuff, and it all looked so yummy.  The service was alright. The waitresses kept a good eye on us, and were quick to bring us our orders.  Definitely a quality resto."}
{"text":"so the moment we come in the service was horrid. we came in for take out a piece of cake and absolutely no greeting excepot an unacceptibl look on the womans face with tattoos on her arm and a look thats says why the hell are you here.  we ask for a menu and she treats us like a nuissance.  like wtf im just a customer.  anyway horrid bad attitude and ive been here a few times never had that b4.  never will go the first floor."}
{"text":"Great little spot when you one want something central and don't really know where to go. The fact that the place is open 24 hours is definitely a plus!  They have three different levels with a terrace on the top level which is nice in the summer. I can't comment on the drinks since I don't drink alcohol but service is usually good, unless the place is really busy. I only ate there once and had the pita pizza with salad, which has a good quality/quantity/value ratio."}
{"text":"BLINDLY following a group of people past a narrow front door, I found myself in front a stairway to somewhere.  At the top, we got a glimpse of the restaurant decor which had a nice cafe/bar mood but after a couple steps we were back on a second set of stairway to the CAGED roof-top patio which reminds me of some ancient apartment patio's back in Hong Kong.  Also reminds me of stories of Hong Kong Karaoke joints in apartments that catch on fire and people try to stomp on each other to go out the ONLY exit.  The good thing is that the cages here look wimpy so you might be able to leap across the other rooftops during emergencies.  Services was very nice with efficiency as long as they can REACH us through the single-row stairs that remind me of the original Donkey Kong where people are the barrels and make it difficult for Mario to get up or down the stairs.  Be POLITE and let the servers with Food or Dirty Dishes go first.    We were provided lots of Ice Water to combat the heat and I think Shari M. got comped for her Italian Peach Premium Iced Tea.  To Susan C., it was more like Italian SNAPPLE Peach Iced Tea.    Dulce de Leche Cheesecake($7.00) was pretty good with Choco shavings on the side but probably work best with some fruit on the side to cut some of the sweetness with every bite which actually was not overly sweet."}
{"text":"I've never sat in a place for an hour and not been served a drink. The server brought water and asked what we'd like. Having just sat down, we'd said we needed a minute. She didn't come back to take that order. Another server worked on the tables around us, and eventually brought us more water, but also didn't ask what we'd like. It became a kind of comedic moment, like one where you wait for that guy from Just For Laughs to jump out and tell you the crappy service will live on forever on airplane entertainment terminals.  But it wasn't a prank! The original server came back an hour later. She was on break--possibly eating and drinking--can't be sure, as she only stood there as we explained that the window for ordering food and drinks closed ages ago. Weirdly, no actual apology.  More bizarre than anything.  Maybe wear fluorescent clothing if you go to ensure service."}
{"text":"Notes:  1. I only ordered a \"premium iced tea\".  Apparently, it \"tasted like Snapple,\" says Susan C. 2. The patio on the highest level was a bit sketchy.  You're fenced in and there's raccoons chillin' on the rooftops! 3. Service was good, despite missing a couple of people's orders at the table on their initial trip. 4. Open late late late (probably the man reason most people go here) 5. As Wayne C. eluded to...you probably don't want to be stuck on the top floor if a fire breaks loose.  There would be bodies piled up in the narrow stairways.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Whether you want food alcohol or coffee. Whenever you want it. That's the beauty of this 24/7 joint. We got the nachos which is pretty generous portion. The place has some character to it as well as it is an old house. Has multiple levels and generally there's enough seating."}
{"text":"Updating my review since I've now had a late dinner here in addition to brunch.   Got here at around 10:30pm on a Thursday, perfectly peckish post Elite Event at Fire on the East Side. The place wasn't packed, and we were seated quite quickly on the ground floor (there are three levels to this place; the upper two levels have a bit more atmosphere, but I didn't bother -- I just wanted to sit down and chow down, ya dig?)  7 West is a place to get a solid meal, even if service is a little bit on the slow side. The Rosie Ravioli is absolutely delicious -- definitely give this a go if you're a cream and/or vodka sauce fan. Martinis are a little bit on the pricey side.   I think I prefer the weekend brunch offerings to the regular menu, but either way the food's decent and it's close by. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot, pretty great 24/7 diner! I find some of their dishes are a bit hit or miss, but you can never really go wrong with their mac and cheese! I get mine with jalapeños and I add Montreal smoked meat from time to time. It's usually a very rich, creamy sauce with some nice kick from the jalapeños. It's a cool spot to go to on a late night out with friends - the ambience is nice and each floor has a cool vibe. My only complaint is their consistency. I find every time I come, my meal is a bit different - the sauce to pasta ratio, the consistency, the presentation etc. staff are usually helpful but at times they seem a bit confused or are inattentive altogether.  I find I have to ask for basics like more water quite often. Regardless, it's a cool late night spot whether you want to sit in with friends or take out some \"real food\" after midnight."}
{"text":"Great spot to satisfy that sweet tooth craving you get at those odd times.  Their cakes are amazing. I would have to say their best cakes are their red velvet and banana chocolate chip. The cakes are always moist and are more cake than icing which makes it even more tasty!"}
{"text":"3 floors of dark, moody ambiance that sets the tone for an intimate evening of cocktails. I tried a special that was a spin on my favorite: the gin and tonic. It took a little while to get someone to take our order, and the drinks were slow to arrive. I'm not overly impatient, but this became the theme to the evening. When we decided to call it a night, it took probably another half hour to ask for the check and be rung up. Everything seemed to run very slowly here. When my boyfriend presented his debit card to pay, he was told only cards with chips were accepted. As we're are visiting from the states (which haven't changed ALL cards to the chip variety), it was frustrating to only have that option or choose to use their ATM on another floor and be surcharged. Luckily he had enough cash to cover the bill, but the server made it seem like more of a hassle than was worth her time. It sounds as if we're not the only Yelp reviewers to find the service to be entirely lackluster. It's a shame because the potential is high for this really cool space."}
{"text":"I think Meg Ryan operates this cafe and I'm opening a corporate Starbucks across the street and then we meet and somehow hit it off...   well the details are a bit hazy but this is definitely the cute cafe that I can picture a entrepreneurial minded indie mid 30s woman running in addition to a book store/flower shop; is it true? I don't know, but I like it.  Had a wonderful omlette from a helpful, nice server who had on tight leather (or perhaps pleather) pants."}
{"text":"Usually I am very satisfied with 7 West. I love their Rosie ravioli pasta, which is usually delicious-- very creamy and tomato-ey-- and I leave satisfied. The interior of the place is romantic and unique; it's also open 24/7 which is a huge draw since you can just show up any old time you feel like. Service is nothing to write home about but mostly gets the job done I guess.  Last night was a completely different story though. Rosie ravioli for some reason tasted completely lame and like they had bought the cheap store brand version of a sauce from a grocery store instead of the usual homemade tasting creamy-tomato version. Even worse was the exceptionally terrible service we got. We were in a group, and there was another group and table on our floor. I had trouble knowing who my server was, and was largely ignored. There server tried to pin the blame on us, saying we were supposed to do something else to avoid waiting so long to pay and leave (as if we the customers were magically supposed to know that when in all other instances I have waited for staff to come to the table). I really hope things improve service-wise. Don't come here for the service, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there 5 days ago for the first time at 2am.. Food was not bad at all for a 24 hour restaurant.. Servers are nice and the service was quick. But the servers could be more professional and wear like a united uniform rather than random clothes.. Washrooms are incredibly small and tight.. But overall would visit again if i was around the area  and there is not alot of options.."}
{"text":"This place is alright: not great, not awful.  The decor on the lower level is nice, pleasant, and intimate enough for a good conversation. It was difficult to stop getting distracted by the music which seemed more appropriate for some teeny-bopper clothing outlet in a strip mall.  The server was pleasant but must have had ADD or something. She could smile but not remember; serve but not clear. She spent 15 minutes rolling cutlery, not noticing that her mere four tables were trying flag her.  In addition to the appetisers, your selections are limited to salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and pastas. This sort of menu is typical to a 24-7 joint that needs to streamline its food storage and production: you'll find the same basic ingredients used in varying combinations across the entire menu.  The quality of the food itself was good but not memorable. Frankly, though, what else are you to expect from a $15 pasta past 10pm? It's good enough that the next time we want late-night grub, I'm sure this will be in our top three places to consider."}
{"text":"Great vibe. The decor, candles, layout and ambience of the whole place is just relaxing and inviting. I only came here for dessert and a drink.   The martinis were strong (but good) and the cake was just meh. A slice of cake (red velvet) and a drink came to $20. So it's a pricier place (you're paying for the atmosphere and the fact that the place is up and running 24/7). I didn't think the food - or at least the dessert - warrants the price. I'd rather go to Futures. Side note: I also had a bite of the chocolate cake that night which tasted better IMO.  I would possibly check it out again, but wouldn't be heartbroken if I never get the chance."}
{"text":"Honestly a hit or miss! Adore the ravioli, the mac and cheese (must add jalapenos to it) and that it's open 24/7, BUT the service can be excruciatingly slow.   One time they had almost a full first floor (guests on the upper two floors too) and only one cook in the 1st floor kitchen (the other kitchens were closed). We waited an hour for our food... not a good first impression for my parents who I had boasted about the place to before. Pick a good time to go at and if it's busy upon entering, ask about the food wait times if you're in a rush!  The food can also be a miss too as the pizzas are tiny kid-size ones with a small salad on the side! Despite all this though, I give the place 4 stars and will keep returning since its charm is worth it and I'm safe with my two order choices!!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, so my review may or may not be edited after I try their food. We had California Cabernet Sauvignon, which was good, but served too warm. What I do love about this place is the atmosphere, it's cozy, cute, there are three levels to the place, the last being the \"attic\" type, dark and candle lit. Overall cute place, good for a casual date or group hangout and open 24/7."}
{"text":"Whoa, a 24-hr joint that's not a MickyD's or Timmy's or Fran's? DECE.   A friend recommended this place for its desserts. Try the Apple Pie - it's delicious! Double fudge choco cake - nuthin' to complain about that one. I would pass up the Diamonds and Pearls though, prolly just cus I'm not a huge cheesecake fan :p   This place has multiple levels. Pretty sweet place for a date. Get cozy!"}
{"text":"Love this cafe! It's open 24/7, so that's super convenient (and that's worth 5-stars!). The service is great and the food is good for somewhere open 24/7. My friends and I like to go here on late nights."}
{"text":"Loved it. Everything was perfect. Food is good. Restaurant design is good i. Each floor (which is 3) and it is 24hr! So it is a perfect place to go to very late or very early in the morning. Although i tried lunch which i enjoyed a lot. I go there several times and for sure will go again. Loved it"}
{"text":"Omg, fantastic place. Probably the best mac and cheese with bacon I've ever had. Delicious poutine as well!"}
{"text":"I went there on a late Friday night after landing in Toronto on a recommendation from few local friends. Luckily my hotel was very close by. This is a casual/hipster restaurant that serves mainly sandwiches, salads and breakfast. I thought the vibe and decor was pretty cool. However I wasn't overly impressed by the food. I had the poutine, montreal smoked meat sandwich and italian panini. Everything was good but nothing crazy. The good part is that it is open 24/7 and it avoids you going to a greasy place. I think it can fit a very different type of crowd. Sadly I haven't tried their dessert which I was told was the bomb..."}
{"text":"To conclude the final chapter of our Guys night out escapade....as always after a night of partying, 7 West is the perfect place to cure your hunger, and to end the night.  LIke most places that close around 2am, 7 West NEVER closes, and I consider this a more upscale, more chilled out, easy-on-the-eyes type of cafe.    With an extensive menu, there's plenty of food options available.  In the past, I've notable had their pesto chicken Pollo, Hummas dip, Nachos, vegetarian pasta, poutine, Dulce leche, banana cake, red velvet cheesecake......etc.....   Tonight's craving was their Pita pizza (forgot to mentioned I've had it before) served with their choice of Ms Vickie's chips, or house salad.  at $11.25 its affordable, and its delish.....oooozed with cheese indeed!!!!   But overall, this place is the GO-TO especially after partying hard in and around the downtown core!!"}
{"text":"7 West is slightly hole-in-the-wallish looking from outside ... but the interior is all wooden, dark and cozy with steamy windows & people talking in low voices ... I absolutely loved the vibe & food. I ordered soup (decent) and spaghetti which I found to be so satisfying it had me craving my childhood staple for weeks after! Table ordered some bruschetta which was delish. Portions are huge, no-one finished their meals, mostly due to the decadent cake they temptingly keep displayed.  It was here, at 7 West, that I had an earth-shattering, life changing epiphany: serving cakes at room temperature turns a pretty good cake into an 'omg I'm dying and want to order 3 more slices and eat with my hands without being judged' experience. Seriously, try it.    And eat here, too."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago for the first time, and for a first date! I absolutely loved the atmosphere, very cozy, beautiful lighting, really pretty space in general! The only critique I have is that our server took a long time before coming by with the bill, well actually she never did. My date and I sat at the table with empty glasses, started putting our coats on to kind of signal our intent to leave, I tried making eye contact a couple times but she was chatting with a table about where she's from (which is totally cool, I just wish she paused the conversation.) I ended up just going up the to bar when she was behind it and asked for the bill/paid her there. Maybe that's how it works there? I'm not sure. But I will still likely return!"}
{"text":"LOL.  I feel bad for the wait staff that gotta serve our drunk butts at 3am every now and then... They've seen it / heard it all... from my friend's drunken teary hysterics to me passing out with my head next to my plate... Drunken texts and late night philosophical conversations....   Anyways. Thank you 7 West for being open 24 hours and serving the most deliscious pita pizza I've ever tried in my life and for such attentive and patient wait stuff!   See ya next weekend! xoxo"}
{"text":"I've been coming to 7 West off and on for a very long time, and a few things have changed. However, it's still one of the best restaurants in the city for a quality 'round the clock menu.   Some of my favourite dishes here, are the pastas (their rose sauce is one of the best), the sandwiches and the cakes. I would pass on the martinis as they're overrated (head over to Fire on the East Side for some quality drinks instead).   I wholeheartedly recommend Dad's Belgian Chocolate Cake to all. It's moist, light(er) and incredibly chocolatey.  Service here is a hit-or-miss, but they're always courteous."}
{"text":"Visited in a group late Valentine's night; it was their second busiest night of the year according to our server. He found us a table fairly quickly considering how busy they were. That's about the only good part of our experience. First off, the place was super cold and drafty, so we kept our jackets on the whole time; we were seated on the ground floor. Our burgers took a long time to arrive, and when they did, they were cold and super dry. Also, our water glasses were filthy; we didn't bother to complain as it's not easy to get the server's attention in this place. Overall, the experience is not worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"Cozy and dark, great for a beer or a night time chat with friends. They have a small patio in the back, it's nothing too special but I had a great time there with friends and a bottle of wine. Also great music selection. This is THE perfect neighborhood bar. Also it's open 24/7 which is pretty awesome :-)  This place is so much better than Wish (it's run by the same people).  Be careful of eating out on the veranda on the first floor.... I was accosted by a homeless person and had to move inside."}
{"text":"I was here today for lunch and i really enjoyed the atmosphere. Small and kinda quite. Its a good place to chill and relax while you eat.   Food: I had the Penne Pasta, but i got it with a rose sauce instead of the cream pesto (i think that's what it came with) And it was absolutely delicious. The pasta came with a started salad. Ive never had chick peas in my salad before, but it tasted awesome!   I would 100% go back here again and again. I wanted to grab a piece of chocolate cake (because it looked like heaven) but i was too full!  Bonus- They are open 24 hrs!"}
{"text":"Came here for desserts and a cappuccino late at night (just past midnight) and it was pretty full! . Prices for drinks are pretty expensive (rather go to Panorama across the street) but the food was regularly priced. The place was pretty cool with each of the 3 floors being a bit different (other reviewers have discussed this in a much better way than I can so I'll leave it up to them).  Had their apple crumble pie, and normally I'm not a pie person but I dug into that like no tomorrow. Service was quick and friendly too, I'll be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been here twice in the last month for lunch!   The food is really good and portions as quite large. Both times I have ordered the Pita Pizza (once Sicilian, and once Pesto) and they were delicious. The first time I sat on the main level and it got quite busy which can make eating a little uncomfortable. The second time I saw on the upper level since we were a larger party. The prices are a little on the expensive side for lunch, but the quality and taste are there! Also the service is great. Both times I had different waiters but they are friendly and attentive!   I only gave 4 stars because they seating can be really tight when they get busy. It's almost as if the people sitting next to you are at your table! I understand it is in a victorian style home but I like my room when I eat! On the plus side the music was great, they were playing old school R&B and it brought back good memories!"}
{"text":"This is a charming Victorian house converted to a restaurant. Among its attractiveness is the fact this restaurant is opened 365 days a week. This is very handy information to know, esp the next time I find myself alone for Christmas.  There are 3 levels. Since I was coming in with a group of 7, I thought they would sit us in one of the benches. Instead, they grouped the small (2 person) round tables together. While not impossible to fit everything, it is not the most comfortable situation either. The furniture is on the cheap side.  I had the penne arriabata and a glass of the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon. This same dish in the neighbourhood pub is just as expensive but swimming in oil. This dish was good. My other dinner companions had no complaints about their meals either."}
{"text":"Only one word to describe 7 West's atmosphere and ambiance in the evening: sexy. The interior is relaxing and allows for you and a special someone to tuck away and enjoy some delicious house special drinks.   Personally, the service wasn't amazing. Sitting on the third floor took around ten minutes for us to get our first drinks, even though there's a bar on every level.   They don't take swipe cards either. My credit union hasn't mandatorily updated their cards to chip readers - leaving me to use cash. Luckily I had some cash on me, or I would have had to use their ATM with a surcharge. An inconvenience more than anything, as paper money is the most direct form of payment (IMO)."}
{"text":"7 West Cafe is a joint NOT TO BE MISSED!!!!  As my YELP profile mentions, I am a late night diner - as a filmmaker, I love working all night at late night diners, where my writing is fueled by the energy of the city  7 West Cafe is a terrific place to write!  First off, the cafe is very laptop friendly  Second, the tea and coffee, as well as food, are all solid  Third, the place is extremely unique and very much caters to an 'arsty' soul like mine - there are 3 different floors, with each one claiming a different identity, but all bonded by the fact that none play to conventional rules of interior design (which immediately makes you feel comfy, as an artist, because it only validates the artistic conviction that 'what is different, is good')  For anyone that comes to Toronto, don't miss out dropping by this place  AND PS - their rooftop patio is awesome - definitely worth bringing the love-of-your-life for a late night bottle of wine  Enjoy all!!!"}
{"text":"do not order their soft drinks they will charge you $4.00 a can. prices are ridiculous for such basic tasting food. i ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and it was really oily, i paid $13 for my grilled cheese. ridiculous!!! never coming here again! over priced for no quality shown in the food"}
{"text":"Great place for every meal of the day ranging from early morning breakfasts to midnight munchies! Good if you are craving italian and its 3am!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to 24 hour diners. 7 West is a great spot for coffee, comforting bites, and late-night/early morning conversations.  I've been here multiple times for brunch and was here on my birthday. The food is decent with fair portions. They always play throwback pop songs. I just love the casual intimate vibe."}
{"text":"Open 24/7!    They have a fairly big menu, including fresh home-made desserts!  The decor is cute and quaint, in an old house.  Service is a bit slow.  Prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"Very cute and old place, three levels with differenf decor on every floor. Very decent brunch, the price is okay as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time was quite happy with the food, service, and the ambience.  At first, it seems a bit dark to me but I got used it and kind of liked it. It adds to its home-feel atmosphere, cozy and neat with familiar and simple decoration.  Both times I had sandwich, once Philly Steak and the other time, Montreal smoked meat. Both were great, well-cooked, well-seasoned, and in perfectly enough size. It's only the water on the tables which makes me hesitant to give it full star; it was very warm, served without ice, and was definitely kept outside the fridge. The staff are quick and friendly. The price is reasonable, 12-15 box for a fairly big sandwich which comes with a side, salad or fries. The best thing about this place is it is 24 hours, and has always room for everybody, as it is a three-story restaurant with plenty of tables."}
{"text":"A great place to take a date. The food is delicious and the ambience is luxurious. I have been there twice so far and I love it."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little place! It`s not your typical 24/7 eating establishment. Sure, you can  hit an all night fast food joint or a breakfast place if you are in a hurry but here you get something else.  I can only describe it as a cozy feel.    The menu offers everything from pastas to desserts as well as breakfast.  To top that off, they have a fine selection of coffees to keep you night owls up later.  There is even alcohol if you feel so inclined,  at say, 3 am.  All reasonably priced.  I must say, their dessert selection was impressive.  We went for the chocolate banana cake.  A nice balance of the two flavours. Only criticism I would have to say is, the icing was a bit too sweet but that is just a personal preference.  I would like to try their other offerings like the apple crumble pie.  Staff were wonderful! Very helpful in sharing their point of view on what was palatable.  I really appreciate that you can sit here for however long and not feel as if you should leave."}
{"text":"Arrived in Toronto late on a Friday night and needed some food.  A little pre-trip planning via the interwebs sent me 7 West.  It hit the late night food craving perfectly.  Nice place and good service.  Had an old school classic of Grilled Cheese and potato chips.  It was good.  Also had the soup of the day that perfect.  Overall, very tasty.  7 West started off my long weekend in Toronto just right."}
{"text":"This place was very cute. It struck me as a good date place.   I initially sat on the main level, then moved to the patio, and I'm so glad I did! The patio is super cute.  My order (pesto pizza) hit the spot and was perfect for a lunch."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a drink or small bite when you just want to hang out for a long time. It's owned by the same people as Smith on Church St. so has very similar vibes with a grunge/industrial decor and hanging lights strewn around the 3 floors. Would definitely recommend for a place to chill, but not so much for the food."}
{"text":"Love this place for the following reasons: 24/7, it's cozy, and my new late-night go-to place when you want a fairly quiet cafe to catch up have some beers/coffee/&eats!!  Had nachos and pizza and both hit the spot (I was hunnnnnnngry) and were thoroughly enjoyed, although I wouldn't say they come close to being the best in the city!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was about 10 years old [I am now 21], so perhaps I'm a bit biased, but I never have a bad time here. The food is wonderful, and as an aspiring chef, I like to think I'm not horrible at critiquing food. The service isn't always on point, but that tends to happen at places that are open all the time. I get it, humans get tired. The drinks and desserts are awesome. The atmosphere, beautiful. Love this place, will always take the time to travel from Mississauga to the core of Toronto."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a 24hr place nearby. Good for cocktails a meal or a dessert."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Nothing spectacular. Service was fine. I'll go back to see if they can wow me abut more. Certainly not bad but nothing super amazing."}
{"text":"Such a cute and cozy place to get a late night meal and drinks. Food is great. Atmosphere is great. Late hours are a huge bonus!! If you're in the city and looking for a new place to dine, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to fall in love with this place, from the moment I opened the doors to this restored old-city townhouse tucked behind an unassuming street entrance off Charles St. As I ventured up the narrow staircase to the third floor the delicate lighting and charm of the architecture was a pleasant sight to take in. Unfortunately this is where the whimsy ended for me. The seating itself was far from formal and barely squeezed into a level 5/10 comfort criteria, (according to my personally developed and highly adept glute accommodation scale)   Now to the main event, the food! Well sadly for 7 West Cafe, (actually more unfortunately for my DC and I) the food resembled the calibre of a university cafeteria - and not those fancy restaurant ones they have nowadays at Queens and McGill - no this stuff was of a make-do quality. Service was nothing notable and the prices, although not exhorbent, were certainly marked several fold above the plates that were dished out.   Advice:  DO go to 7 west cafe for a late night snack, a drink or a neat vibey hangout.... DON'T go for dinner. really, the foods not good."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty boring and bland nothing that jumps with excitement ... I don't think for something so basic like a Tuna Melt sandwich is worth 15 bucks :s...Concept is cool and the decor is pretty cute, but after about an hour you feel like with the dim lights,dark narrow stairway, and crammed corners everything is caving in.   The service was nice and attentive but everything else was just whatever...  btw... PLEASE TURN UP THE AC!!!!!!"}
{"text":"second thoughts on the nachos..  went there last night with only a semi buzz on and they were not as good. it seems like they throw whatever veggies they see fit on them (last night was a few slivers of red and green pepper). Also, mozz cheese, where's the chedda??"}
{"text":"I have been going here since my first year of university. This place isn't kidding around when they say 24/7 and year round. Open on all holidays and Christmas. The ambiance is a bit romantic and cozy, filled with couples.Not the best place for lonely singles, but overall just a nice place to enjoy a Irish coffee with delicious cakes."}
{"text":"The location of this place is convenient. My friends and I have been here twice to grab a bite to eat before heading to the Panasonic theatre.  The first time we went they were very accommodating. One of our friends had a broken leg so they were able to seat us on the first level. There are three levels to this restaurant and the stairs are pretty steep.   The second time we sat up in the third level. The balcony seat is great, however because of the location its difficult to get the waitress' attention being all the at the back. The portions are quite large and its worth the price. However, they did mix up my order and ended up charging me more for my meal.   The mac and cheese was large but a bit plain. I would definitely recommend it with some jalapeños or ketchup if you like ketchup with your Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to go for a late-night hang out.  For a Sunday night just before midnight I was surprised how busy it was.  The food was pretty good and the atmosphere is warm and comfortable.  Definitely be back for another late night hang."}
{"text":"24 hours is worth a 2 star bonus here. For a big city, it's surprising how early shops close. We're NOT the city that never sleeps, so 7 west is a rare gem.  7 West has a casual, intimate vibe.  1) VIBE: 3 floors, each with a slightly different feel. They keep the lighting to an appropriate minimum, with tasteful decor on each level.  2) OPEN: They are always open. And you will be just as happy to go there at 7pm as you will be at 3am (all alcohol levels being equal)  3) ANYONE: Bring a date. Catch up with a close friend. Bring a group.  4) MUSIC: shocking how tasteful the music is. They also hit the perfect volume so that it's always in the background, but loud enough to be appreciated.  5) SERVICE: This can be very volatile, especially when it gets busy. But normally the servers are friendly.  6) VERSATILE: You want alcohol? Dessert? Pasta? Dip platter to share? Cappuccino in a bowl? Done.  7) RELIABLE: It doesn't seem to have changed in many years, and that's a good thing. You know what you're getting.  7 west is worth far more than the sum of its parts"}
{"text":"Great 24/7 hour cafe. Went for dinner. Had the rosie ravioli -- was okay, but not amazing. Ambiance is nice - would be great for dates or late night drinks."}
{"text":"Maybe closer to a 3.5/5 depending on the night. The Bloor/Yonge area has always been strangely bereft of good dining options outside of grab-and-go places, so I find myself heading to 7 West periodically.  Food: Nothing extraordinary, and a little overpriced, but they have a wide variety of food items and some of their burger/sandwich options are surprisingly tasty. Appetizers are a generously portioned.   Drink: A good selection of the basics. Some of the cocktails I've tried are good, maybe a couple were below average.   Service: Not too shabby. You won't be left waiting eternally. I also appreciate how they leave each table with a bottle of water and replenish when necessary.   Ambience: Probaly the main reason to come here. Cozy, intimate, and softly lit, but without feeling staid or stuffy. You can sustain a conversation without having to shout over the table. The uppermost floor feels like a private room."}
{"text":"Extremely cozy and nice place. A very good find and plus it is 24/7 only makes the place even better for students. Their prices are relatively appropriate for the portions and sizes they provide. I had came with two friends for a late lunch and we ordered the Rosie Ravioli andAll Day Breakfast with a sub of french toast.  The ravioli has the option to be either a lunch size or a dinner size. It also came with a side of their house salad and two pieces of bread. The salad was alright overall, not the most amazing salad, but it suited the meal well. The ravioli had a rose sauce that had a tanginess and acidity that likely came from some sort of wine. The filling of chess and asparagus was very creamy and complimented the sauce.  The breakfast foods were pretty standard, however, the french toast was made with cinnamon. For those who don't like the taste or smell of it, you've been warned.  All and all, i will be coming back, especially after studying well into the night, it's comforting knowing that at least one place is open."}
{"text":"I love you 7 West.    You have been there for me for years.  I want to say for at least 19 years, is that even possible?   From day drinking on the back patio, dates ranging from causal to fancy, girlfriend catch ups, solo dining, contemplative, university age angst journal writing over coffee.   You have been a loyal and an under-appreciated friend.   I adore places that can offer different experiences.    Every floor has its own, slightly different vibe. Food is decent (do not expect amazing but price reflects what you get) as are coffees and cocktails. Almost a quarter of a century later, I can appreciate that their wine list is not great but who cares!   This is not the place to go for fine dining and a sommelier worthy wine list, it is a place to go because it is there, and fun, and iconically Toronto.     4 stars for everything food and service related, 1 star for nostalgia plus another 2 stars for being open 24hrs      7 stars for 7West"}
{"text":"Disappointing service and food. It took over an hour for us to get brunch when our waitresses section was half full. She kept forgetting our order and had to stop by the table for us to remind her again. When our food finally came, the eggs were burnt and pretty much everything was cold (toast, bacon, sausage, eggs). We even overheard other tables complaining to the waitress about the service.   I have been to this place before and it wasn't half bad, but after the horrible experience today I am crossing it off my list."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Went here a couple of nights ago with some girlfriends, and immediately came back the next day with my boyfriend because I liked it that much. It's the type of place you can go to for drinks, dinner, dessert, brunch, or even just coffee; it's open 24/7 and their menu has a very wide variety of items so it's very flexible in that regard.  It's a little hole in the wall near young & Charles that you might miss if you're not actively looking for it. It has 3 floors, and an indoor patio upstairs, and the ambiance is really nice. A very chill place with dim lights, benches, tables, candles, etc. It's the type of place that's really nice to go to on a first date, or when you're with people that you can just chill and talk to/hang out for hours & hours.  The food is good, but nothing too special (that I've had, anyway). I've tried the all day breakfast which was good, and my boyfriend has had the lasagna which he also enjoyed. I've also had the \"diamond & pearls cheesecake\" which I found would have been better if it was not served at room temperature and was chilled a bit more - but maybe that's just my preference .  My favorite drink here is the baileys hot chocolate - mmm mmm, can't go wrong there!   The service was alright, but definitely the type where if you don't flag down your server when you need him, you may be waiting for a while.  If I could rate this on ambience, atmosphere, and convenience alone, this would easily be a 4, however, with the good-but-not-great food & similar service, this is closer to a 3.5.   All in all will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had in restaurant in Toronto. We waited for 45 mins before I went and got our menus myself and water and glasses. Honestly just avoid this hellhole, it's not worth the epic frustration. Staff was rude and refused to make eye contact while serving other tables. Do not go here, go to McDonalds instead. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is a great little place, tucked into an area with very few other \"great little places\" to choose from. Each floor offers a different feeling: coffee shop (main floor), dining room (second) and pub (third). It's got something for everyone, but the super casual vibe runs throughout. I like this place!"}
{"text":"I have been working in the hospitality industry for more than a decade, and in all that time i have never had as peculiar an experience as my one visit to 7 west.  The food was reasonably priced and reasonably tasty, but the service was beyond atrocious.   Our server (man with a star tattoo on his right forearm) never refilled our coffee unless we flagged him down and made him do it. He  would regularly walk past our table, with a full pitcher of water in hand, yet my glass remained empty for most of the meal.  Once we finished our meal, we sat at the table, with no plates and empty glasses, for about 20 minutes before we were brought our bills (again, after flagging down the server and making him do it).  I was paying debit, and if you want to add a tip, you can either add 15%, 18% or 20%. No other options  I know what it takes to be a good server, because I am one, and people tipping for bad service is the reason there are so many awful servers in the world. If you are rewarded for being bad at your job, why would you have any motivation to improve?  I wouldnt be surprised if our server was the same as the other 1 star review, what i do find surprising is him continuing to have a job there.  I will never visit this pretentious restaurant again."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this place and to try their cakes. Cakes were amazing. The place is nice, more of a romantic setting. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at the restaurant, but I've ordered in from here a few times. Their pasta and cakes are phenomenal and I would give 7 West a 5 star rating were it not for the fact that it's a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Honestly though their Lasagna was probably one of the best I've ever eaten and could easily have been two meals if it wasn't so delicious (and if I wasn't so greedy)."}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this place. Tucked away and almost unnoticeable, you can literally walk passed it. It is three floors, a series of steps only wide enough for one way traffic. Washrooms are no bigger either; unisex, both located on the second floor near the stairs and ATM machine.   The dim lighting and tea light candle lit tables offer an intimate dinning. Over head you'll hear a variety of top 40's. Not too loud, not to soft enough for you to enjoy, sing a verse or two and drop back into your group convo. Oh did I mention they are open 7 days a week/365 days a year...24 hrs!!! :0  I introduced my brother and his gf to this venue. We came for a mini celebration. Wohoo!   Had some appetizers; poutine (of course) and the bruschetta with cheese added. Enough for 3 to share.   Drinks; Manhattan (me, this lady loves her martinis), old fashion, and a French martini (pineapple juice made it a little too fruity for my liking, but still yummy!)   Mains; house BLT w/ ceaser salad (I don't recommend the ceaser...I've had wayyyyyy better but does not affect the 5), Sicilian pizza and a veg pizza. All enjoyed with great pleasure.   The service was decent, and the waitress was patient with my brother and his gf as they intensely scanned the menu (their 1st time, to be expected)     Overall it was a well enjoyed outing.   Cheers yelpers and safe long weekend!"}
{"text":"It is always open.  It's always been open.  And everyone's been here at least once.  People from out of town think that you're some kind of genie for \"stumbling\" across this random place.     That's the kind of place it is.   It builds credibility if you're with out of towners, and removes it when you are with those who have lived here for years.  They have a decent menu.  They have decent ambiance.    People often come here on dates.    It's a Wesley Willis song waiting to happen."}
{"text":"The only gay owned and operated establishment west of Yonge street worth frequenting.   Good value, reliable and always a vibe 24/7.    This would be 5 stars if they did something about the ventilation.   Our clothes stunk when we left.  Not great for a first date."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see this place rated 3.5 stars on almost 300 reviews because the food is atrocious. On my first visit a while back I recall ordering a pasta dish that resembled more of a soup; it was drenched in sauce. Now, about my most recent visit that made me write this review. I needed some late night food, had limited options and was craving some mac and cheese, so I thought why not give 7 West a try. Ordered a mac and cheese for takeout, and to be absolutely fair, I'd rather eat Kraft Dinner, just look at the picture here. And no, I didn't purposefully take the picture mid-meal to try to make it look worse - it can't be, it really tastes just as bad as it looks. Wow"}
{"text":"The cutest cafe in Yorkville :)  It's three storeys high and we sat on the third floor beside the window overlooking Charles Street, nice ambiance.  Waiters/bartenders were funny to talk to; beware though, they might try to convince you to grow a beard similar to the one that all three of them are sporting, because apparently that'd make people take you more seriously.  Yup.    Penne Arrabiata - I'm usually quite okay with medium spicy food, but the Italian sausage in this penne... man.  The sausage itself was already spicy, topped with the spicy tomato sauce soaking the penne, you would need a lot of water...  Their selection of wine is decent and the ambiance is definitely there.  However, suggested to go in groups of 2-4 and 6 max because each floor is not particularly spacious and you wouldn't want to get divided up.    I'd go back again for their 24/7 brunch :)"}
{"text":"This place has one thing going for it: its open 24 hours. There aren't enough places in toronto that are open 24 hours (or at least really late). The atmosphere is pretty cool on the 3rd floor. But i find it very cramped. And i've never ordered anything there that was particularly good (food or drink). They could use some free wifi."}
{"text":"Service was slow and seemingly uninterested. I ordered a burger and paid extra to add cheese which was not actually added on. Don't worry, I still got charged for it though. Speaking of the bill, while the food is very moderately better than your average pub, it's priced like it's a high-end restaurant. The quality and service does not justify the cost.  Also, they serve steak fries which while cooked well, are not a type of fry I care much for. I would have much preferred a shoe string or crinkle cut fry instead."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. This place has a good atmosphere, but food is just ok.  Not a fan of the chilli. Service is good."}
{"text":"Great place to go for late night cravings, dates, catching up with friends, your cat Bar Mitzvah, anything, since they are always open. Actually one of the most decent 24 hours restaurants in town.  The menu offers a wide selection and is reasonably priced. The portions are HUGE. You won't leave starving. As for execution, don't expect some Michelin Stars, but it's good and simple classic comfort food.   This restaurant has 3 different floors with different decor, but same cozy atmosphere. My favorite one is the third floor, it feels more intimate. There's also a covered patio. Please note, this one you might get intimate with a raccoon on the nearby roof, if you go with a girlfriend, she might not find it as amusing or cute as you do.   The service is always casual and pleasant.   Like other reviewers mentioned, the music is good and not too loud. So you can enjoy it and also hear your dinner partner.   You should have a good time."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place ever since I saw the pictures of desserts on Yelp! I came here on a date on a Friday afternoon. We were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress and we were told to go upstairs. Once we were on the 2nd level, we were told that we can seat ourselves anywhere on the 2nd level or go to the 3rd level/patio area. Obviously we had to see what the 3rd level/patio looked like so we went up the stairs again. Since we did come here in the afternoon, there weren't many people here.  I ordered a sloppy Joe with a side salad since I don't think I've ever had one and my boyfriend got a burger with chips. The sloppy Joe and the burger was good and it was about the $10-11 range. I liked the dressing for the salad and it tasted very fresh. I'm not sure if they make their own chips (I don't think they do) but it was good.  I'm a dessert lover so of course we had to get desserts. I'm unfortunately came with somebody who has very sensitive teeth so I couldn't get the chocolate cake that I wanted. Instead, we went for the apple crumble with whipped cream. The combination of the whipped cream and the warm apple crumble was delicious (and my boyfriend almost didn't want the whipped cream...fine, it was me who almost caused us to not have whipped cream).  People were friendly and food was good for a great price. I'm definitely making this one of my go to place!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice, because it was near my hotel: once for breakfast, and, a few days later, for a late-ish lunch.  The egg platter -- what they call the \"Lucky Seven\" -- was excellent. The young waiter seemed a little rattled -- I had to get his attention a few times for coffee refills and such -- but he was very nice about getting me the special (CAD 7), which ended at 10.00 am. (I came in just before 10, but wasn't waited on for a bit.)  For the lunch, my friend and I were seated upstairs. The service was prompt and efficient, and my veggie-burger platter was topnotch."}
{"text":"24-hour spot, will save your life with good drinks and decent cuisine. I went there late night and they were playing all that 90's songs we all love, and I only missed somewhere I could shake my booty while slurping my caesar.   Appetizer sampler was really, really good and my main dish was a caprese salad - there's no way you can mess with a caprese salad. Then we decided to indulge our tastebuds and... ask... for... more.... CHOCOLATE. Mom's Dark Belgian Chocolate Cake is what you've been dreaming - be sure to ask only if there are 2+ people willing to share."}
{"text":"7 West Cafe is a great little place for a date.    This three-storey cafe lies just south of Bloor, west of Yonge.  The interior is nice and dark, setting the mood. As well, the place is kind of cramped - an advantage if you want an excuse to get cosy!  The music selection isn't bad, nor is it overbearing.  As for the service, the waitresses are sharp enough and have a pretty good sense of when to come by or when to leave you alone.  One of the cooks is vegetarian, so accomodations are easily made if you want to tweak any dishes.  The pizza is decent and not the greasy kind, although nothing memorable.  For appetizers, the mixed Mediterranean appetizer platter is a meal in itself, unless you're feeling ambituous.    A good hideout for lovers, but not a place for a rowdy group."}
{"text":"It was way too hot inside but the food and decor were great. The staff was very friendly and approachable. The plain pizza was decent,  the nachos and bruschetta were great. The apple crumble pie is superb. The pecan pie is amazing. The Belgian dark chocolate cake is okay. The banana chocolate cake is great."}
{"text":"Nice and quirky. It offers very unique dining experience. A restaurant built inside a church that offers a diverse menu from Burgers to pasta. The food is great late night since it's 24 hours.  I recommend the hummus plate and salad. The service is super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Such a long wait for breakfast! Visited this cafe on a Sunday around 11:30. The food wait was crazy long. Although our server was pleasant and the food tasted alright, the wait for a waffle was pretty ridiculous.   On a positive note, this place has (probably) the best bang for your buck for mimosas. That being said, I'm not from the city so coming here and receiving what we did was a definitely worth the extra star."}
{"text":"It's open early for breakfast which is a good thing. The service is really friendly as well. I did however find it very pricey for what you're getting, and the food was alright."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, wasn't that busy. Excellent service! We didn't order anything but wine and cake but the menu looked really good. Their cakes were fresh, moist and offered plenty to choose from: red velvet, Belgian dark chocolate, chocolate banana and carrot cake. I'll be back! Tip: if you're tall watch your head when you enter/exit the washroom....ouch :("}
{"text":"extensive menu   The interior is perfection. It's cosy, stylish and the perfect spot to take that one friend who is always on the trend!  I only went in for a dessert and it was lovely that we weren't rushed out by the staff. I tried the dulce de leche cheesecake which as incredible and you have to do it.   I'd love to go back for lunch and try a sandwich of their extensive menu! Would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"The place was empty for lunch on a Friday and I know why. Their food is poor quality for the price, and not even the nice decor and location can bring customers in.   Lunch price $11.95 for spaghetti + house salad/soup. Sounds like a good deal? That's their most inexpensive pasta option and the spaghetti was worse than store bought sauce. Also, the soup of the day (pea soup) had no other flavour other than a large amount of salt. So imo, not worth it.   The 1 star is for their $17.95 lasagna (no lunch option, no house salad) so I thought it must be some bomb ass lasagna asking for almost $20 when all the other pasta lunch options were $12-15. I was very disappointed at first bite to find out the centre was COLD, not warm but cold. I sent it back to be reheated giving their cook a another chance but after a long wait, it came back and the centre was still cold!   Okay so I called the server back and complained and he didn't even care about how upset I was with the poor food quality. Now is where I lost appetite of eating here, not only their server did not apologize or offer anything to make up for their poor quality, as I went up the the counter to cancel my order, I saw the cook microwaving the dish! Wow, $20 for cold, microwaved lasagna seriously? Their food is clearly not fresh and their cook does not know how to heat up food properly.   Their service suck and food sucks even more. Recommend 7 West to properly train their servers and chef at least up to basic standards. To be fair I might come back for dessert since their cakes looked good but would not come back for food again."}
{"text":"Anytime food and good times. Toronto is an early city for me--this place serves comfort food but also lets you keep the night going way after the bars close. Love this place."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! The food is absolutely delicious, and the ambience is perfect for a date night. While the space is not very large, 7 West is open 24/7 and I've never had to wait for a table (there are more upstairs!)  I can rave on and on about how amazing the rosie ravioli is. It's definitely my go-to anytime I visit and don't feel like trying something new. Never fails to disappoint! The pesto pollo is also delicious, as is the penne arrabiata. The absolute best part is definitely the Belgian chocolate cake. While I'm not normally one for cake, THIS cake is a must try for everyone. It's incredibly rich and decadent, but not at all heavy or overly sweet. I can't even describe it in words, you have to try it out yourself!  Service is not always the best, as the servers tend to chat behind the bar and ignore the customers. The prices can be a little steep for some items ($4.00 for a gingerale) but it's definitely worth it for the cakes and pastas.  5/5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I went here for a work lunch a few weeks back.   I usually love places like this and keep them in my back pocket when I'm looking for a place to eat but I just couldn't fall in love with it. We waited for just under an hour for our mains and it just wasn't worth it (That is pretty much the only thing that would have saved our trip out).  The staff was friendly but it just took too long for them to execute a mediocre meal.  There really isn't anything wrong here, it's just that I've definitely had MUCH better."}
{"text":"The waiter was very friendly, food was great, and opens pretty much 24/7 (some floors closed). Great place to go if you don't have a place to eat and everywhere else is closed."}
{"text":"Boo!!!! When I ask for no tomato on my burger, and my friend asks for no onion in her pasta..... that should be easy to follow...... shouldn't it?????"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot.  Lots of regulars.  Attentive and friendly wait staff= great service.  Eclectic decor.  Generous portions and a good price- a neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Open 24/365 days, have been here many times over the years.  Perfect place to come after a night out or to bring someone from out of town.  Casual and friendly ambiance in a 3 story townhouse setting.  Very cozy.  Not a good spot to read as lighting is dim.  Mostly filled with night owls and students at the time we have been here which has been at night or early mornings - think between 12 and 4am.  Licensed for alcohol, although have never had a real drink here except for specialty coffees.  Food is a couple notches above fast food but nothing spectacular.  Reasonable menu, something for everyone.  On this occasion we had teas and banana chocolate cake, which was good.  Large slice easily shared between 2 people @$8.50 a pop.  I will definitely be coming back again and again as there are not many quality places open all the time ... and I mean all the time.  Keep it up guys, and happy new year!"}
{"text":"This was a really sweet and romantic little place. The pesto pizza was delicious but it was more the atmosphere that won me over."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, and it left me feeling quite unsatisfied.    We started with the platter, which was a good size, but was loaded with tomatoes of all varieties, sundried, stewed with goat's cheese, chopped up topped on bread with cheese.    The tomato theme continued with my sister's penne arrabiata, where the sausage was merely a side to a too-tomatoey pasta dish.  My bacon mushroom burger was dry and under seasoned, though it was loaded with bacon and the bread was wonderfully chewy .  My husband's chicken club, which fell apart as soon as he took the toothpick out, was a thick and poorly marinated chicken breast atop thick slices of toast with a few good slices of bacon, and accompanied by Ms. Vickie's salted kettle chips.   The dessert is another story- this is something you must have.  Their red velvet cake was moist, and evenly layered with a good spread of cream cheese frosting that made me gluttonous.  I wouldn't go here again for the food, maybe just the cake..."}
{"text":"Walking up Younge Street can be sketchy. The strip is filled with grimy restaurants, fast food joints, stripper bars, and weird souvenir shops (no I would not like to buy a ceramic figurine of Mickey Mouse). Hidden just off of Younge is the gem that is 7 West Café.  Arriving at midnight, I had a mission: To study for my exam, and to eat. As soon as I stepped into the low-lit town house, I knew my mission was possible.  The atmosphere was just what I needed. Enough liveliness to keep me awake, but not so loud and distracting that I wouldn't be able to focus.   Being a student, I'm used to spending 10 dollars on a meal AT MOST. I'm not used to shelling it out. At 7 West? You have to shell it out a little. This being said, what with the price range being a little higher the food is that much better! This is no greasy spoon my friends. Oh no. Waaaaay delicious. And healthy? Way more healthy then greasy fries. I myself ordered the \"Moroccan Chilly\" ($6) and a bowl (yes a bowl) of tea ($3). Super yummy. Oh and my servers? THE NICEST!   Quiet, calm, yet alive 7 West quickly became a favorite of mine by the time I walked out the door... at 4 am.  Can't wait to go back. Hopefully with more monies in my pocket."}
{"text":"Service blew so hard that my friend and I literally got up and left after waiting to be approached for 30 minutes for our drink orders (and we weren't even technically approached at all.)  So yea, we get there on a Tuesday evening around 7.30 and the place is POPPING, and by popping I mean, there are only 2 free tables out of 7, and the music is BLARING out of the speakers. For such a small, intimate space, I found it jarring to hear Matchbox 20 (also...really? Matchbox 20? This place really is time warped straight outta the 90s) on volume knob level 11 on a calm Tuesday night. And the bass from their speakers shook the damn walls. Like, come on guys, chill out with that.  So yea, we step into 7 west, NO ONE says hi, greets us, anything. And we chill for about 10 minutes at a table we seat ourselves at. The server doesn't approach our table. Another 5 minutes, my friend approaches the bar where the server is seems to be glued to the floor and asks to be served. Another 5 minutes later, the server finally shows up with 2 menus and doesn't say A WORD TO US and basically runs back to her bar fortress. Another 10 minutes passes by (we were done with our menus 8 minutes ago at this point) and no server in sight. So my girl and I were like \"Um, wow, F this shiz.\" And we bounced to the Good Ol' Duke of Gloucester for drinks.  But yea, waiting basically for 30 minutes to put in a drink order is so beyond absurd I can't even.   Maybe 7 West should close down for some nights and let their burnt out, frazzled servers sleep cause your service is HILARIOUSLY BAD."}
{"text":"Have been to 7 west many time and their desserts never disappoint; however, was disappointed with the service today. We went as a group of 6 for coffee and dessert and was charged 18% gratuity when the menu clearly states that gratuity of 18% is charged for groups of 8 or more. The waitress made no effort to explain the discrepancy nor did she inform us about this \"sudden\" change in policy ahead of time or during the course of our meal. very disappointed with the service or the lack there of. will not go back."}
{"text":"Some reviewers mentioned that this place's only appeal is that it's 24/7 and isn't fast food. I have to disagree.   The atmosphere is really nice. It's very dark, so I guess it makes it a great blind date spot to visit if you're not sure what your date will end up looking like. With 3 floors you have a bit of choice with what noise level you're sitting in. Which I suppose can also help you with a poor date. I kid!  On a serious note, the service is ok (nothing mind-blowing and you may not get much service depending on where you're sitting) and the drinks (while a bit pricey) are delicious. I didn't have a chance to try the food, but the items weren't too cheap.   This place is the perfect place to go to if you've been out late with your gf/bf or friends and want to keep the evening going, but you don't want to go to a loud club/bar."}
{"text":"I've ordered food from 7 west cafe twice from foodora, so this review will be based solely on the food quality and takeaway service. My order both times was for approximately 10-12 people during lunch time on a week day. We placed the order at 9:30am both times, selecting a delivery time of 12pm.   FOOD: While other people have tried the pasta and pizza and both found them tasty, I tried the tuna melt, house salad, and veggie burger with bacon on top. All foods I tried were more on the dry side - they all could have used more sauce. I did like the hint of spice in the tuna melt, but didn't like how mushy the burger was as it would stick to the roof of your mouth.   SERVICE: Service was great the first time we ordered. Food was warm, came on time, and added funny messages to each of the dishes. So we decided to order from here again, which was a huge mistake. The food arrived on time the second time around, but the quality was awful. We ordered 4 cans of pop, but they never made it in the takeaway bag and we never received it. Part of our order included 2 veggie burgers and 2 side house salads, but we received 3 veggie burgers, 1 side house salad, and a closed empty container (Note: these containers are clear so it is very easy to see if there's food in it or not). Go figure. To add to the mix, we also requested separate ketchup and mayonnaise on the side, but they mixed it together in one container.   Overall, I don't think we will be ordering from here based on our last experience. I'm not quite sure how quality standards were missed by that much, but it's not a chance i'm willing to take again."}
{"text":"It only gets the 3rd star cuz its open 24 hours, that's it.   Overpriced standard-fare food in a dark, dingey restaurant with crowded seating. Did I mention it is incredibly over-priced for the lack of originality a joint like this SHOULD have as a downtown eatery?"}
{"text":"My workplace ordered lunch here a few weeks ago and it was absolutely terrible. I had the burger which looked like a rat stuffed in a bun. I didn't even bother to eat it. It looked mouldy and off. One of my colleagues wanted the vegan burger and they put mayo and cheese on it?? :| another colleague had the pulled pork and she said the bun was stale and the meat was salty. I could go on about how poor the food was but I doesn't even matter because I  have NO desire to eat here ever again. The only decent thing is their pasta and even that was bland."}
{"text":"At 3:30am in the morning, my boyfriend and I had the biggest craving for desserts. We typed into Yelp \"dessert\" and what came up in the top 10? 7 WEST CAFE!  Located a block from Yonge and Bloor this restaurant is conveniently placed within downtown Toronto. Offering a wide range of food, 24 HOURS a day! We sat down on the first level (there are three levels in total) and the atmosphere was like a dimly lit room in a house. (The restaurant itself is a house transformed into a restaurant.) This was my second time at this restaurant and both my experiences were amazing!   The first time I order a pasta, it was about a year or two ago, I can't quite remember. But recently when I was in search of dessert, I stumbled upon their Dulce De Leche Cheesecake! It was AMAZINGGGGG! All the reviews on Yelp recommended this dessert and the people of Yelp did not fail me. My boyfriend got their Belgium Chocolate cake. I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan so I didn't enjoy it that much, maybe if I had a glass of milk I would've liked it better. It took me about 5 minutes to gobble down my slice of cake.   We also ordered nachos and mac and cheese. They were good, but nothing satisfied my dessert craving like the Dulce De Leche cheesecake. But it might have ignited my feelings to return to the restaurant again.. and again.. for that cheesecake.  This is a place everyone needs to check-out! 24-hours and downtown. Give it a try!   - CL   p.s. the servers were still lively and nice when we arrived. :)"}
{"text":"This is a very unique venue. It is three floors, and not only can you have drinks or dinner, but you can also do work using the WiFi, and it is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I just realized I hadn't written a review for 7 West! It's the place to go to when you're in the Yonge/Bloor area. Plus it's open late at night for those night owls & clubbers. Last time I was here I had the pesto chicken pasta which was absolutely delish. And we had a slice of chocolate cake for dessert which was totally sinful. Yeah, 7 West remains a cool place to hang out. When I attended the premiere of Sharkwater a while back (a documentary on guess what? Sharks!) the film director & star Rob Stewart invited everyone over to 7 West where they were having an after party. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 7 Breakfast (poached eggs). Was decent, although my eggs were over cooked.   Service was so slow. Our waitress had to reconfirm our drink order after not bringing out our drinks for 15 min.   Would not return."}
{"text":"I come here mainly for dessert. The place can be too noisy to have a conversation. I came here with a group of friends once and my throat was so sore from shouting.   Food-wise it's like any other bar-type food. But whenever I come here, I zero in on their desserts.   I don't know but that white chocolate cake seems to be screaming my name. ALL the time. It begs me to eat it.   I enjoy the place more in the afternoon when music volume is much lower.   Try that white chocolate cake. Now."}
{"text":"I remember 7 West as THE date place back in the day but I hadn't been to back in awhile.  I decided to revist for lunch at the invitation of my sister who had a Groupon voucher.  We were seated on the main floor and noticed that the tables were quite close together.  Luckily I hadn't planned on having any super private conversations.  We ordered the house salad and the proscuitto sandwich.  Salad was good although we asked for no onions and onions still appeared.  It was also a bit heavy on the dressing.  The proscuitto sandwich came with a side of crisps and was good but ordinary.  Not my first choice for lunch in the area but food was passable.    Maybe it was because it was day time but it just didn't have that cozy, intimate feel I remember from years back?"}
{"text":"Very decent.   Cool downtown atmosphere. Nice and friendly staff.   Food tasted fresh. We both had breakfast style sandwiches.  The bagel one was way too cheesy but some may love that.   Going to be a short review since we were in and out but I'd come back for sure.   Menu seemed nice and items were all fresh."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff extremely atentive, i live in the area and I recommend all my friends to stop by there for a nice meal. The prices are very affordable. I truly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was a great place - we went in after some good pasta (having had a couple bad experiences elsewhere) and were very pleased.  The Virgin Pasta was wonderful - crispy veggies with a nice round mouthfeel and overall flavour.  We went for dinner so the portions were very big, and being a carb fiend, well, let's just say I'm in love.  I had a great doubleshot latte with some red velvet cake (my first, oh man) and I am going to go back.  A lot.  Great service, a really nice atmosphere that we felt comfortable to hang out in.  No cats, but hey, you can't have everything.  =)"}
{"text":"Where has this place been my whole life???  You know on Friday's when you're like...\"I'm going to a bar later, but I need to eat so I won't barf or be turbo hungover tomorrow..\"  ?  Well look no further, this place is for you.   The food is cheap, there's a big menu, admittedly the wine is a little expensive but it's a cool ambience.  You chill for a few hours, get some sauce into you and head out on the town like bandits.  And since it's 24 hours, you can always come back later if you didn't have room to eat everything you wanted to order.  Big Fan."}
{"text":"SUCH a cute little spot! Almost hidden away but that's what so special about it. I love how casual the atmosphere is and the service is VERY nice. I love the water in the glass bottle that is served. I ordered the Rosie Ravioli (asparagus and ricotta stuffed), my best friend ordered the penne primivera and my aunt ordered the lasagna. All were excellent and the garlic bread we ordered on the side was amazing."}
{"text":"OK - this is THE place in Toronto .... from 2am onwards .... to get a full meal, chill and catch up with folks coming off of their fun nights out, or just finishing working over at the rail. The menu is fabulous, esepcially for an all nighter spot.  3 levels of fun with closely spaced tables - but somehow at this place you don't mind at all :-). I'm a big fan of the chicken primavera pasta dinner, usually at about 3:30am.  Exxxxxxccellllent! These servers really get the crowd too ... a tough job serving that late and ppl coming off of big nights . . . but they are on the ball, friendly and helpful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My group arrived at different times and also realized that when we asked for a table of 4, we'd miscounted and needed one more seat. Our server (on the first floor) seemed to be having a bad day, or has an ingrown chip in his shoulder. First, he very rudely asked/snarky-told me to remove my wine bottle (my friend's gift to me) off the table. Fine, no problem, it's moved. Then the logistics of adding another chair to the table seemed too much for him. Then when we were ready to order, he wasn't able to even acknowledge us for 10 minutes! Nope, we picked up our things and moved up to the third floor.  Third floor was a bit better, we ordered with minimal fuss. I had the pesto \"pizza\", or pita with toppings, as it was. Others in my party ordered the sloppy joe sandwich, montreal smoked meat sandwich, a poutine and chicken penne. I had the house red on special, and the bf got the Barking Squirrel beer on special. Food took foreverrrr to get to the table, and when it did...it was dramatically mediocre. No dressing on some of the side salads.   When the bills came, the drink specials were at full price, instead of the advertised special price. That had to get changed. Props to the server, though, for splitting our bills with minimum fuss.  But the 1-star, beyond poor service and mediocre food, is reserved for the \"something\" that two of my friends saw scuttle across the floor. Nope...return visit cancelled."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4 *s. It has the potential of being a 5 *s place.  The Greats: *Great intimate atmosphere -- 7 West has one of the nicest, coziest vibe that I've ever experienced. Beautiful wood. Lovely touches like an elegant and not overly opulent crystal chandelier. Most of the tables are set in a way for a cozy tete-a-tete. If you're lucky, you can score a table upstairs by the window so you and your date can peer out and people watch.   *Open 24-hour -- One of the less than flattering descriptions of Toronto that I've heard is \"Where fun comes to die.\" Stores, bars, restaurants, clubs, they close earlier than I would like and many neighborhoods are pretty dead after 6 pm. So having a place (especially one as nice as this) where you can come in for dessert and coffee after a fun night out is sorely needed and appreciated.  The Really Needs Improving Part: *The food -- It's the only thing that's really holding this place back. While nothing is really terrible, I can't say that the food is good either, which is really sad for a cute place as 7 West. I found everything to be on the bland side and I wasn't impressed by the desserts. It was just adequate.   I recommend coming to this late at night/early in the morning because nothing else is open and hopefully you're drunk enough that everything tastes really good."}
{"text":"My first visit to 7 West was when I was in town visiting a friend a few years ago.  We came in for dessert around 1:00 am, and I was in love.  This place was part of the reason I decided to move to Toronto.  I love that it's open 24/7, I love that it's in an old house, I love the church pew benches.  My roommate and I ate here like 3 times a week when we first moved here.  It's a little more expensive than I remember, but everything I've ever ordered has been delicious!  Their house salad is amazing.  I always bring visiting friends and family here, and I will for sure be back many more times!"}
{"text":"When you walk in you instantly feel like you're in an old house. It's quite dark and cozy here. Go upstairs for a warmer and more spacious spot. Each floor has a different menu apparently. I loved their butternut squash soup and their pesto pizza. They're open 27/4 and the majority of staff are warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Our first lunch in Toronto was perfect here. Nice place to chill, have a sandwich and cocktail. Very quaint cozy little spot, we sat on the second floor. Efficient service and tasty sandwiches."}
{"text":"The best part of this restaurant is that it's open 365 days a year! Wow, what restaurant do you know does that!? Not many. We came here after our trip to NYC and we were tired and it was a holiday so many other restaurants were closed. We always order the chicken penne or chicken carbonara. They are amazing savoury pasta dishes that fill you up to the brim. It's a bit pricy at $16 but you'll never leave hungry. The sauce is delicious and you get hearty chunks of chicken. Pro-tip: ask for the sauce to be thick."}
{"text":"I went there with a very good friend of mine two days ago. I really enjoyed the music and the overall vibe there. The food was okay (nothing extremely good or bad). I ordered the mac and cheese and although it's different than what I was expected, I liked the taste. The drinks there were good. I hope they could have a larger variety of cocktails. The service was okay... I would recommend it to dates or to people who wanna hang out at a relaxing place. Love the Christmas decorations there!"}
{"text":"It was 10PM on a Thursday night and my parents were looking for a place that serves pasta. Let's just say there aren't a whole lot of options you'll find around Toronto for pasta late-ish on a weeknight, but Yelp led me to 7 West Cafe. 3.5 stars, 253 reviews, I was willing to at least explore the option - so I opened up the menu.   It was awesome to see how many options they had, and it wasn't just pasta. They had pastas, pita pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pretty much something for everyone - which is a great thing for a place that's open 24/7 and potentially sees crowds and people of all types. Anyway, we decided to check it out!   As soon as we walked in, we liked the way the place was set up. There were three floors (the first floor was closed when we went), and each floor was a small space with a bar and tables dimly lit by candles. The music was great too - well, it wasn't top 40 which was an immediate positive, but they were playing classic, melodic songs that went perfectly with the ambiance.   We ordered the spaghetti, Pesto pizza and a grilled cheese sandwich. I won't go into too much detail about each dish, but the food, overall, was actually very good. The spaghetti ($12.95) was tasty; the pesto pita pizza ($12.95) was an original take on a pizza (had a whole wheat option, which was awesome) and came with a salad; the grilled cheese sandwich ($8.95) was good as well, and we ordered it with their baked potatoes - which, let's be honest, you can't go wrong with!  We liked that the food wasn't overly expensive, with most of the dishes being under $15, and it was indicative of a place that was more than just a diner, but less than a fancy restaurant - pretty much just what we were looking for.   I can safely say I'll be back."}
{"text":"REALLY?! $7 for a Dulce de Lèche Cheesecake?! Are you kidding me this better be goo... *fork enter mouth, moment of silence, entering a world of ecstasy*  That is all!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I spent more time in the area but now it's a bit of a trek! Still love how its open 24 hours, super laid back, and just a good place to hangout without needing to impress. Also great breakfast/brunch for those late nights that turn into mornings.   Friend wanted to meet here recently and I was surprised that not much has changed. Cute little patio area on the top floor was pretty full but we managed to squeeze in the last two spots! Waitress was great, super attentive and friendly. Food and snacks were only okay but the desserts were good. Drinks were pretty good as well - strong with house made bitters. Not as much selection as I would have liked but plenty of decent alternatives."}
{"text":"7 West Cafe was a great mix of good food and good ass vibes.    We came in about 12pm on a Saturday and ended up leaving around 3. The quality of food here is ver good for the unassuming facade. Exactly why I like it!  The vibe in here is sort of treehouse like with a great selection of music. Like they should start posting their playlist, good.   I'm a HUGE cake lover and their selection of cake is on cake God level. Like YOU NEED TO SAVE ROOM IN YOUR BELLY FOR THE CAKE. The coffee here is pretty legit too so try saving room and time for dope music and cake and coffee before you head out. #grammar"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the city center~~~ We cannot image it's a modern style cafe with golden decor, red velvet cheese cake,  diamond & pearl cake (8cad ) and apple cider can make your day~~~"}
{"text":"3am visit with some friends and a sweet tooth. We ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake, the belgian chocolate, and the diamonds and pearls cake. I recommend the dulce de leche cheesecake as the actual cheese part was infused with flavour. The diamonds and pearls cake I believe was a rasperry red velvet and cheesecake fusion; nice."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of this place previously, and just came with a friend before we went to catch a show at the Panasonic Theatre. Quite honestly I would have walked past this place without a second thought, not even realizing it was a restaurant/cafe. From the outside, it just looks like a house.  They have 3 floors, and my friend and I sat on the first floor. To be honest the whole setup is kind of confusing... they don't have anyone there to greet you once you enter, so my friend and I just randomly went into the adjoining room and sat ourselves down at a table. We didn't even know whether we were supposed to go upstairs or not. Once we sat down, no one bothered to attend to us or even bring us menus until 10 minutes later. Overall, I can't say I was too impressed with the service here.  I ordered the penne chicken, which was cooked in a white wine cream sauce, while my friend had the pulled pork sandwich. The food was pretty decent, and very filling, but nothing really too exceptional.  Afterwards we decided we had to try some of their dessert (you can see their cakes on display at the front counter, and we had been eyeing it all evening.) Ended up trying the red velvet cake which was fantastic and super smooth and creamy... just like real velvet. Yum, so good.  7 West was kind of a hit and miss for me in various ways. The food was okay, the service was lacking. Our server was friendly when she was there, but most of the time she was nowhere to be seen. I get that it's meant to be kind of a more laid back, relaxed vibe, but I didn't like the lack of direction I guess coming into the restaurant, and there were various times when we wanted to place our orders/refill our water/pay the bill when we had to sit around and wait for the waitress to come. Desserts were good, but not really enough to make me want to come back again unless I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Been going here for a very long time. The food is always great. Great space. Love that it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"I usually get the breakfast. You can never go wrong with the breakfast. Their cakes are also delicious, and their house wines are also pretty good. The waiters are always very sweet and actually try to help you have a good time. Would go back any time, good thing their open 24/7!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to take a date; low lighting, good music, and tight quarters make a romantic ambiance.   Food and drink is good and well-priced , and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Trendy/Modern/Edgy/Funky/Small Restaurant/Lounge/Bar/Coffee&Friendly staff and a Fun Croud!  5 Min walk from Subway!"}
{"text":"That give me a choice when I have no idea of where i shall have  breakfast . It opens 24H , that's great for me such as a  girl lazy to cook.  The two young girls work there are nice, friendly.  Also one piece of plate is always too much to be finished.  I like the soup, with brown bread beacon and eggs so on"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always sit in the same booth with a drawer filled with notes written by other customers. Every time I eat there I ask the most lovely waitress of all time Katerina for a pen to write my own and contribute to the drawer. It's these little things along with the great food that make this place my second home. If you go, sit on the bottom floor, all the way to the left with the drawer, and ask for kat to serve you. You'll fall in love."}
{"text":"A few notes from my last visit at lunch. Nothing really went right. My fountain pop was flat and tasteless and a replacement was served warm with a sliver of ice in it (running low, guys?).    I started off with a house salad which was hair-pullingly boring. The green peppers were faded and yellowing so I basically picked at the chick peas in it. My ravioli was a similar snoozefest. I just hated it.  Some silver linings? There are cute little 7s on the table tops and the ceiling is painted with clouds. It's like you're inside, but outside. Yay. Small victory, I guess.  Also, if you want to know what it's like to use a lavatory the size of an airplane washroom but 36,820 feet closer to the ground, come here. Next time I return, it'll be at 4am when nothing else is open."}
{"text":"The service was good, our waiter was nice and pretty funny. Both of us decided to order the pesto pollo penne (apparently this is a famous dish here). This wasn't the best pasta dish I have tried, meaning I have def. tried better. I feel like it could have been a bit more creamier, and had more meat.   One thing I disliked about having dinner here would be that we had to sit all the way on the 3rd floor (yes we went up the stairs), in a small room with several other people. I felt so claustrophobic in there! I wish we could have got seats elsewhere. If so, maybe my view on this restaurant would have been a bit different. Also, we waited around an hour to get a table."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian pizza, vegetarian chili and grilled cheese.  The atmosphere and diverse crowd was warm and oaky, helped by the low lights and wooden everything."}
{"text":"Very Trendy little hidden gem, I was invited to start my bar hopping adventure here with a few friends of mine. There were 4 of us in total and when we ordered water with lemon, i found it awesome that the bartender brought us our own pitcher and was being sure to keep an eye on it in case we needed it to be refilled. My friend and i ordered the Jimmy Buffett Martini which was very tasty and went don't smooth (no bad alcohol after taste) I shared the pulled pork nacho's with my other friend, I was shocked to see the size of the order, very generous and extremely tasty.    The atmosphere was cozy and tiny, this place was multi-leveled and had me feel right at home, I found it was awesome that this place is open 24-7 so at any time of the night or day you could end up there relaxing and enjoying the great food and drinks while catching up with friends..   I will be returning to this place for sure..."}
{"text":"Like coming here. Place has a good vibe and I like that breakfast is always an option. Awesome veggie burger and good desserts. Service is pretty good and prices are reasonable.  Limited wine list and a tad on the pricey side but overall this place is a great little find!"}
{"text":"I am a 24/7 type of person who's constantly b*tching about the lack of 24 hour establishments in the city that aren't a grimy, terrifying coffee shop or strip club. 7 West is my answer to everything I'm looking for in a hangout, with the bonus of being open 24 hours a day!  I've had numerous birthday celebrations, first dates, brainstorm meetings and post-bar meals at 7 West - it's excellent for all of these things. The food is tasty but what really shines is THE DESSERTS!  If you go to the second floor there is a large display of massive cheesecakes, pies and tortes to choose from that rotates pretty often, depending what they have in stock. My #1 cheesecake to recommend is the Dulce De Leche, which as you can imagine from the combination of dulce de leche + cheesecake + crumb crust is otherworldly. If they have it on hand you'd be a fool not to order it.  There's also a really sweet, partially covered patio in the summer that seats about 15-20 people."}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEats and got the arugula salad with tuna. The tuna was actually a tuna salad which had onions in it. I would appreciate if this was mentioned on the menu because I REALLY HATE ONIONS. A lot of restaurants assume everyone likes onions and leave that ingredient off the description and it's a pretty frustrating surprise when you get your food. The rest of the salad was fine.. just couldn't eat the tuna."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good every time but sorta expensive. It's a good amount of food tho I could never finish a carbonara pasta on my own"}
{"text":"Came for the best banana chocolate cake and they told us they switched suppliers. Brutal. Last trip to seven west. New cake sucks."}
{"text":"I have wound up here many nights when everything else is shut down.  The three levels and patio divide the space well and make it feel intimate while still having a lot of seating.  It also makes it pretty versatile - good for a date or for a small group.  At 3am, it is a good spot to wind down a night while enjoying a menu that's strong for the hour.  I'm a fan of the sampler which is great for sharing.  The patio on the 3rd floor is tiny but its nice that its there.  Not a lot of great post 2am spots - this is one of the best."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER, AMAZING CAKES! Servers aren't the greatest but just ignore them cuz the food is all that matters."}
{"text":"So - so"}
{"text":"This place is super cozy !! Food is way to over priced, and is nothing special, they could do much better if they wanted to, its great that the place is open 24/7 so you could come in whenever you feel like it, i guess thats a plus. Also great place for a drink and just chill with some old good friends of yours, thats if you have any ;)"}
{"text":"A decent place for a date.  Great intimate setting.  My recommendations: rosie ravioli, dolce dulce cheesecake."}
{"text":"The most recent time I was in the city I went here twice in two days I originally found this on yelp and was looking for a place after dinner with my girlfriend.  I have outlined a couple of points and scores below....      - The desserts are phenomenal : had the carrot cake and was amazed at how good it was.  Was voted best carrot cake in the city....great stuff     - Be aware that many couples will be here making out so be aware I was told that the the third floor is the place to be for couples and lovebirds    - The lighting is dark so it might be difficult to read a book     - Bathrooms are not a pleasant experience very small ...think phone booth  :-)    - Kahlua HOT CHOCOLATE IS GREAT TRY IT OUT.....TASTY AND SMOOTH.    - Great after dinner date place......  Score :       Service : 4 ( great service although it wasn't WOW service friendly staff helpful)     Food and Coffee :  4 for Food ( for the desserts it was great ) and Coffee was about 3.5    Alcoholic Drinks : 4 (great mixes with the coffee's and alcohol)  My Girlfriend's Words about 7 West :  The carrot cake was mouth watering - mmmm - sensational feelings ran down my spine after having one piece.  East or West, 7 West's the best!  My only suggestion : Make more alcohol with coffee, tea and hot chocolate mixes....until than ill see u at 7 west with a slice of Carrot Cake......"}
{"text":"I adore this cafe!!   It was my shining light! I was in definite need of a super late night meal. No where in site could I find a resto that wasn't a fast food chain or offered anything besides a late night snack menu.  Then suddenly I remembered vacantly passing by something about a 24/7 cafe!!  Alas a place that offers a full course menu in the wee hours of the morning!!! Its open 24/7 365 days a years!!  It's really cute and cozy and has 3 different levels. I was up on the 3rd level. Really great music was playing. It was super dark, thank god for the candle on the table or else I don't think I would have been able to see the menu.  All the wait staff here were super friendly, funny, and energetic, which was surprising to see at that hour of the day!   With the help of our waiter I decided on the meatball sub - meatballs and tomato sauce on a panino bun. The sandwich consisted of 2 giant but tender and super moist homemade meatballs on a soft toasted bun topped with tomato sauce. I loved that the whole sandwich was soft enough to smush down but still held its shape together really well and I didn't have meatballs popping out or sauce ooozing everywhere. Simply delicious. Although I did wish I had extra sauce to dunk my sandwich in but I just prefer a saucy sub.  The sandwich also came with a house salad that was lightly dressed and consisted of romaine lettuce, purple cabbage, red and green peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, and chick peas. I quite enjoyed all the fresh vegetables in the salad and loved that it contained chickpeas!  Finally Dessert! They have an impressive list of homemade cakes. I had to try the Red Velvet and got a Bowl of Cappuccino (you can get a regular cup or bowl) to wash it down. The red velvet cake was sooo moist, probably the moistest red velvet cake I've ever had, the cream cheese frosting was perfect, not too sweet or sour. A flawless cake!  Cappuccino came in a huge bowl, good amount of foam, prefect strenghth and was pretty good no complaints here.  FYI The bathrooms really are tiny!! It was like they split one already small bathroom into two. I thought it was hilarious but probably not soo much for a larger person.  Overall good food, even better desserts, great music, friendly service, and its open 24/7 !!!"}
