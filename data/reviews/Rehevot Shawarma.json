{"text":"Excellent falafel (moist, flavourful) and desserts! Bakalava, cheesecake and they have poutine combos"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had, this place has the best welcoming fresh food ever since the new management took over, looking forward for another delecious meal!"}
{"text":"I've had shawarma all over the Middle East and this is easily the best shawarma that I've ever tasted. The portions are absolutely gigantic and the customer service is excellent. Falafel was amazing as well- so crispy and fresh. 

This is a family owned place and I will absolutely be back the next time I'm in Toronto. Amazing!"}
{"text":"best fresh mediternean food you could ever have, i rate the service and the free deserts they offer with the meals!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Skipthedishes and was not disappointed.  Had the beef shawarma on rice and both the beef and the rice were tasty and arrived hot.  Also had calamari which was good but small, wish they had a larger portion option available."}
{"text":"Decently fast and tasty shawarma, though the rice was quite dry. I'm going to chalk that up to ordering 2 hours after the lunch rush. The chicken was well seasoned and they gave good portions. 

They were light on potatoes and salad however and the interior is not very warm and inviting. Overall I'd come here again to try something else on the menu, but there are better shawarma places in the area and I'm not sure they'll be around long."}
