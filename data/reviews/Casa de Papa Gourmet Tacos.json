{"text":"Went in on July 4th, the atmosphere was nice.  Place was very clean.  Ordered the fish taco and the carnitas taco.  Both were very good."}
{"text":"Tried this because I saw it on uber eats. I'm so glad I found this place it was really good. The tacos have a lot of meat and are really good. Definely a must try!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best tacos Ive had in Arizona! The coconut shrimp mango tacos are phenomenal! The owners are amazing, very personable and they make you feel like family. We've only been here once by will definitely be back to try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"This is a great 0lace to go get street tacos in Surprise and the selection is great. They also have great burritos. My favorite is the surf and turf burrito. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Excellent customer service and very fair prices. I want to eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Went to Casa de Papa on a Thursday for lunch.  Ordered carnitas burrito and rice and beans.  Burrito was bland and very plain.  Only had meat, onions and cilantro in it.  Was supposed to come with guacamole but they forgot to put it in.  Asked for guacamole and received what  seemed to be store bought.  Definitely not freshly made.
Sevice and staff we're very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time with my fiancé and the food was great!! Good service, clean, and the tacos were loaded up! Everything was made fresh and tasted like it too. Definitely added to our list of favorites here in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos,  I recommend the blackened fish.  Very generous portions of fish in the tacos,  two are enough to fill you up. 

Simple menu,  reasonable prices and quality ingredients compared to other taco shops. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I cannot give it less than one star but that is exactly what it deserved. I ordered the carne asada and it was so dry and hard that it was like eating cardboard except I'm sure cardboard would have tasted better. The name says it serves gourmet tacos but honestly you can get a better and fresher gourmet taco off one of Ralph's food trucks. Will not ever return."}
{"text":"We were excited to hear about a taco shop opening close to home and decided to run over to get some this morning. The website said they opened at 8am, but they actually open at 10am. They may want to update their website as well as their Yelp page. My husband ordered three tacos (carne asada, fish and shrimp). All were bland. Hardly any flavor. The majority of the flavor came from the pico de gallo, and that wasn't even very flavorful. They served each taco in it's own full sized Styrofoam container. That would make sense if the tacos were huge or something, but they were small tacos on one tortilla that fell apart as you picked it up. And the paper they put it on just got stuck to the food so we were pulling shreds of paper out of our food. The shrimp taco was the best out of the three with a good flavor.

The worst part of all, for this gourmet taco shop, was my rolled tacos were frozen tacos that we can buy at the grocery store. We watched them be pulled out of a box and be heated up and topped with some pico de gallo and avocado. 

The shop was clean and in a good location. Knowing this shop is new with their grand opening just happening this weekend, I think we will give them a few months to iron out any issues and then try them again later."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Mexican food place  you can find  around surprise the burritos and tacos are delicious they also have great daily specials my favorite item is the papas burrito and the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"We had coconut shrimp, crispy ground beef and carne asada all were excellent!!! Great service too!"}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and have been searching for a great taco spot. I found it by accident and I'm so glad it's close to our new house because I will be eating here regularly.  The food is awesome, service is great and the specials are a great value. I highly recommend this place to anyone who really loves tacos and Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nothing \"gourmet\" about this place. Unfortunately they served me stone-cold, canned refried beans. When I told them they were cold she asked if I wanted them microwaved.... The rice was bland, the coconut shrimp taco was just ok BUT the carne asada was good. The girl at the counter was overall nice and friendly. Just very disappointed with 3/4 items on my plate."}
{"text":"This place charges you for everything the put in the burrito 

Like beans, rice , cheese anything extra.

$12 for a simple chicken burrito.

Outrageous 

Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Completely and totally disappointed. First of all the dining room was filthy. It was only 3:00pm and it looked like 2:00am at a sports bar. The kitchen too was filthy looking. When we received the nachos...... Total and utter disappointment. If you've ever had nachos from anywhere, even Del Taco, these were worse. They wouldn't refund me and they were justifying what was in the pathetic container housing the horrible mess. We tasted a few bites and walked out and went straight to Carrumbas. Happily ever after!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I was blown away. I'm from California and have been looking for a good taco place and the flavors were great! I'm super picky about my rice and beans and they were delicious! The coconut shrimp taco was the best taco I've ever had! So flavorful and fresh!! The calamari taco was also delicious. My husband & mother both loved everything they got and my son was satisfied with his kids meal. We are so happy we found a spot up the street from us with such delicious food. Can't wait to try more items on the menu! The workers were also very helpful and sweet! They were so great! Can't wait to take family when they visit from out of town!"}
{"text":"Without question the best ground beef taco I have ever had! A crispy homemade shell barely held the delicious beef and other super fresh fillings. I ordered two and grabbed some salsa from the counter...after the first bite I discovered these little morsels didn't need any salsa, they are awesome on their own. I could have easily eaten one more cuz they are kind of small , but worth the $2.69 each.
Great find here, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first dinner from Casa de Papa's.  I chose this from Yelp and location.  It was an easy in and out from Grand Ave in Surprise.  There was a very nice variety of menu items to choose from at decent prices. My husband chose the surf and turf molita which I tasted (by accident) and it was tasty.  The good news for him was that it was NOT TOO SPICEY or filled with onions.  I had the adobada milita which was great with a a very pleasant pineapple \"relish,\" I have forgotten the correct term.  I added red and then green salsa to spice it up.  I ordered a side of refríed beans which neither of us cared for, but to be fair I opened it after we were finished with all the food.  It might have been better accompanying the other dishes.

I am delighted to FINALLY FIND a Mexican restaurant near our new home that takes call-ins. and is easy to get in and out.  Besides the food would be worth some inconvenience!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Fresh tasting. I had the crispy beef tacos. 

However. I found the portion sizes to be rather small for the prices. 

And:  for me, the salsa makes or breaks places like this.  Unfortunately that's where this place falls short. Both the red and the green house salsas were bland and flavorless.  Maybe they keep something hotter in the back. If I return I'll ask and update accordingly."}
{"text":"I see where they were going with the food but it just seemed to lack much flavor. Technique was good and they get style points but just fell flat on seasoning. I guess the may be a product of being in this town. This place is so close to being really good. I hope they figure it out. Hint, plain ground beef in the beef taco is NOT ok. Add some chile powder and cumin and drain the grease. World of difference. Blacken the fish and shrimp and it would be amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on7/16/17. Place was bright and clean. Food was good but expensive for what you got. Ordered the shrimp cocktail but they were out of shrimp. Bill was $19.60 for a burrito and a steak quesadilla and 2 sodas. You place your order at the counter then help yourself with your beverage. Then you wait for your food to be prepared and have to go back to the counter to get your food."}
{"text":"First time here and probably not going back. I don't like to give negative reviews but in this case I had to share. First off they took for ever to complete a simple order. Secondly the food was not good (chorizo burrito and rolled taco's) the fries were good. Everything came out to $19.00...wow.

My tacos barley had any cheese or sour cream and to top it off the shells were burnt. Also what was that mystery meat??? I know this is a new operation and I sincerely hope this was just a bump in the road......I always support the small business community"}
{"text":"Went there on taco Tuesday, my hubby and I tried 5 different kinds of street tacos! We both liked all of them! I liked the sauces on all 3! I've never had a grilled fish taco, they have always been fried! On a recent trip to California had Baja Fresh and was disappointed at what they called a fish taco! A tiny tidbit of fish! You can see the fish on the taco here, not as much flavor, but the sauce made it flavorful! The one I found most different was the coconut shrimp with mango salsa, still liked it but think I will stick with the carne asada as I liked it the best! I'm sure we will return and try the burritos! Something a  little different than standard fare! The young man at counter was very friendly and very helpful, hope they stay in business a long time!"}
{"text":"I was driving yesterday and came across this place called casa de papa gourmet tacos. So today I decided to give them a try. Being a California native ( Orange County ) I'm very picky with Taco restaurant's. The place is cozy clean and the staff is courteous friendly.  Asked how long they've opened. He said about 4 months he said they were from San Diego CA.I was expecting street tacos, the small corn tortilla type. When I asked if they were this type . The young man said no, that they were the standard size corn tortilla. That being said. I ordered 2 carne asada and 2 al pastor ( marinated pork ) and a fish taco. There are two types of soft tacos . Northern Mexico style which is what they make here. Typically they are the standard size corn tortilla with the meat Pico de gallo and guacamole. Then you have the Southern Mexico style. Small corn tortilla aka street tacos. Which are smaller filled with meat diced onions and cilantro with a dash of hot salsa . ( better tasting in my humble opinion) Then there is the deep fried or hard / crispy taco found in both northern and southern Mexico. Now that you know the difference. Lets talk about my order. I started with the fish taco, must say I was impressed the fish was not deep fried. Took a bite the fish melted in my mouth it was tender and beyond delicious. The taco had the fish shredded cabbage a special orange sauce that gave it that special taste and a lemon wedge. One of the best fish tacos I've had here in Arizona by far. A must try.  Keep in mind that I wanted street tacos. So I requested my tacos without guacamole, just the diced onions and cilantro. Okay so let me tell you the  al pastor ( marinated pork ) tacos. Again impressed with the amount of meat in the taco. Put salsa on it and squeezed the lime wedge , from the first bite I was hooked everything well balanced I could taste the meat and  pineapple pieces just great again so far the best al pastor here in Arizona. Folks you won't be disappointed simply delicious. Lastly I tried the carne asada tacos, must admit I was a little disappointed after tasting the previous tacos . The meat portion is great but a little bland and dry. Could use more spices and not over cooked so it stays moist .  Overall it's great food I will try the carne asada again and also the mulitas. Another northern Mexico / San Diego style item. Come visit you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in last night and I have to say, this place isn't all that great. Nothing special, and just your run of the mill Mexican food. There's much better places in the area that can do \"tacos\" much better. I had the Fish Taco Friday special. Not only did they forget the chips that supposedly come with it, but the tacos were sooooo bland. I mean, basically the taco tasted just like corn and nothing else! My husband said his carne asada tacos were also very bland with not much flavor at all. And both of our tacos were TINY. For like $3+ each, we should be getting more than that. We won't be back."}
{"text":"These guys are still new haven't quiet hit the year mark, so I do have some pointers. 

First , i want to say the good stuff. They are clean from walking in to the bathrooms, tables , chairs and food all clean , thank you for that. 

2nd, nice friendly serves which is always a plus. 

Now here is some things they can consider. I had ordered the basic carnisata burrito which is pretty easy to make as it being a standard Mexican favorites dish. Here is my thing, the burrito was a bit hard tasting i love my burritos to be soft, the meat was a bit spongy which took forever to chew in some cases i had to put it away on the plate. The juices where not there like I'd like them to be. The the horchata from the fountain drink does not taste authentic, maybe switch it up to making a fresh batch every morning. Again just some pointers to help out , u guys definitely seem to go in the right track with the festivities you offer for customers and coupons and discounts which show u guys care so i dont want u to think I'm taking away anything just giving some friendly advice . Yall are still new so lets hope we see longevity and success. 
3.5/5 for now. I will be back so hopefully i can updated my rating."}
{"text":"I went in thinking it would be delicious but unfortunately it wasn't. Carne asada didn't taste like real carne asada. Burrito didn't have rice or beans. Tacos were missing cilantro. Shrimp burrito only had 5 shrimps. Salsa was watery. Horchata isn't real. Beans were dry. Rice was alright. Green salsa was good."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! I love the simplicity of their tacos/burritos. Had both chicken tacos and surf/turf burrito the flavor is perfect! For sure recommend and will def be added to the top of our local Surprise favs! Love that they are on Uber Eats for days you just don't feel like going out. Will def be back and will be trying more on the menu!"}
{"text":"found this new spot today  called Casa De Papa and i enjoyed it way better than that other place called chipotle!!! and it family owned which is a plus A lot of times you get these chain restaurants or the employees don't really care and then the cop attitude but this place was awesome The young man working behind the counter was awesome !! I didn't like a few things in the burrito that I got so I told him to hold them out no problem they did everything I wanted them to do !! we will be back this is going to be our new spot now no more of that other place !!  keep up the good work pleasing your customers !! The only one thing was the prices were a little pricey and the product was a little small"}
{"text":"For the amount of money they charge here you would expect great Mexican food, unfortunately that's not the case. The carne asada burrito is not worth the $7 they charge. There are way better options then this place."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean restaurant and great food. The carnitas mulita was delicious and just the right size. Great daily specials. Will return!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos & Friendly folks 
Wish we could have tried the cafe de olla, though:("}
{"text":"We got lucky! We wound up in this eatery through a fluke; the restaurant next door to it where we had originally planned to eat was closed for a long weekend. And it was excellent! Fun experience began with friendly and eager staff at the front counter. There are many yummy sounding options, but not an overwhelming number of choices. As soon as they started cooking our order, the smells were awesome. When we started eating, we looked at each other and said we knew we'd be back. I completely devoured a fish taco (not fried chunks but actual fillets, with one bone included, but no big deal--just be aware) and a carne adobada taco (so red that it looked like it should be deadly spicy but wasn't). My partner had the three rolled tacos that he raved about. There are several more items that are already on my next-to-try list, including the egg and chorizo breakfast burrito and the coconut shrimp [burrito or tacos?], the latter of which was recommended by one of the cooks/chefs. Looking forward to the next trip there!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite from a local place. This was a great spot to stop and grab a few tacos. Great music to go along with the friendly service and tasty food."}
{"text":"This place is new, it was the grand opening and I went in yesterday. The atmosphere is really nice, they had a live DJ and the place was nice and clean.

I ordered the chicken, steak, and pork. My favorite was the pork, or Carnitas, and then the steak. The chicken was good it just was not my favorite.

They also have this mango salsa that comes on the shrimp tacos that is to die for. I do not like shrimp so I put the mango salsa on my other tacos, and it was amazing. 

The people were very friendly and welcoming, I would definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I ordered 3 tacos to go (pork) and arrived home to find two tacos in the bag; a fish and beef.  Check your orders if you are carrying out.  It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Holy meat! Generous portion of meat in the tacos for an excellent price! I've had the adobada, fish, carne, carnita and pollo. I'll definitely be returning to try a few other items!

What's great about this location is if your waiting for your car to be washed or hair cut, swing in and get a taco in a few minutes!!!"}
{"text":"We were helped by two young girls. One took our taco order and the other girl stepped in to take over and finish our order. When we go home with our to go order we only received half of the order. So I called and asked them to start preparing the rest for pick up.  when I arrived the young ladies were still confused about what tacos they are suppose to make.   it's not hard to punch in 7 simple tacos. When I arrived the second time the ladies were both confused still and didn't prepare the tacos I ordered over the phone the second time. They showed me the receipt and it looks like they only charged me for 4 and I received 3 and asked them to please make me the remaining tacos. Only took me 4 times to repeat the order and two young confused girls talking over me and can't listen that I had to tell them politely to please just listen and let me talk without interruption so we can make this right. I am willing to pay for the remaining they didn't punch in.  After receiving my tacos i double checked the to go boxes and already saw a mistake but I let it go. After getting home we noticed the shrimps were full of butter, and got guacamole vs avocado like requested.

Not impressed with this visit. Don't think I will be going back. What a head ache."}
{"text":"Very pricey! My family and I were craving chipotle and saw this place and decided to give it a try. We ordered their carne asada fries, chicken and cheese quesadilla, carne asada taco and bean and cheese burrito. Everything was made fresh and that was nice. The chicken and cheese quesadilla was very good. The carne asada Taco was good also. The carne asada fries were small and lacked meat, much more fries than meat for the price. For the same price at Fredricos for much more. The beans tasted like rosaritas canned beans and weren't very good and tasted burnt. The red salsa was good with their chips. Customer service was really nice and the place was clean. Overall it was just ok, not a place we will come back but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"The food is authentic very fresh very delicious my adobada mulita was too bomb  we're definitely coming back more often and trying other items but I already know the Mulitas are my go to"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place with lots of promising great reviews. The place was clean and a friendly cashier took our orders (Rolled Tacos, Pollo Asado Gourmet Tacos, and Deluxe Carne Asada Nachos). They have different specials everyday. For the price we paid, the portion of the food (especially the Deluxe Carne Asada Nachos) and the tit was not worth it. 
The taste of the meat (pollo asado and carne asada) was okay. The Rolled Tacos were meh, nothing special about it."}
{"text":"At first I thought slightly on the pricey side but damn after digging into their mashed potato tacos it was ALL WORTH the price!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty but not worth the price. I tried the Mulita with surf and turf. It was basically a small quesadilla made with small taco size corn tortillas. It was very tasty by pretty small for over $7. It doesn't come with anything for that price. I would go back if they lowered prices or offered more for what you pay."}
{"text":"Good food. Good portions. Decent prices. I prefer this over any mexican food restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! There sauces are made fresh everyday and you can taste it! A huge positive on top of the food was the service. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner tonight and brought some food home with us. We had looked up this place on yelp and both of the reviews and photos of the food looks good.

The food was amazing. We had the carne Asada fries which were hands down some of the best We've ever had.  The barbecue shrimp quesadilla was delicious & probably the best thing we ordered.

We each ordered one taco mine was a fish taco and my wife had the carne asada. They were both pretty good but again the barbecue shrimp quesadilla was the best.

We also ordered the carne asada mulita which was good and then the rolled tacos that we were too full to even try yet.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here just now. Awesome street tacos. I had a carnitas and a shrimp taco. The carnitas was huge, and would have been more than enough to eat. Very friendly staff, and very cheap, too. Only $7 for two tacos and a soda, after a discount for working in Surprise."}
{"text":"I have no idea how it got a 4.6 star rating. My only thought is their friends and family left the reviews. I honestly felt it was like someone used to do family functions \"BBQ\" and someone told them to start their own business and they listen to the poor advice. Honestly? The food has no flavor what so ever. Chips and salsa are \"chips and sauce\". Don't bother ordering it. There is my personal and honest review."}
{"text":"When I got notified of this new place that opened up it was exciting. So I told my aunt and uncle it sounded like a good place to try out, and it has to be said we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly. The environment was welcoming, and last but not least The food was great! If your looking for a new place to try out, stop looking and go here, tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada taco and the chorizo burrito. Both were very good. Will be back , just hoping the floor is not as sticky as it was today."}
{"text":"Easily a 10/10.  The food tastes fresh.  It's especially good when it doesn't hide anything with salt and you can taste the quality. The carne asada was tender, marinated well, and you know the chef wants to put his skills on display. The location is a bit odd since it's next to Sprouts and easily missable.  This is where I would grab tacos and burritos if I were in the Surprise area.  That said, it's worth the trip and search."}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many great things throughout the Surprise community that I had to give it a try. We were greeted with smiles the second we op Ned the door. It was very busy the entire time we were there with people coming and going. The tacos were amazing. I literally tried one of each and they were all fabulous! My son had the rolled tacos; which by the way they make from scratch when ordered! We even got to meet the little boy the restaurant was named for when he came in with the rest of the family. Great food. Definitely will be back. Happiness, great service and good food is contagious !"}
{"text":"I'm feel bad about this review. After all the wonderful reviews, my wife and I were excited to finally try Casa De Papa. We were really let down, other than the young lady taking our order, everything was only marginal at best. Only five people in the restaurant but food was slow to arrive, even with a kitchen full of people. I know it is made fresh but still not up to the hype. Tables we sticky and food overpriced. Sorry but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I gave it a shot and I'm not sure what was gourmet about this taco shop other than the name.  

Ordered two fish tacos and I really did appreciate the fact it was actually grilled fish and not some frozen fish stick like Rubio's.  It seemed that really good quality ingredients were used, hence 'gourmet', but I couldn't taste them. There wasn't much substance or flavor to the taco overall and it kind of small compared to equivalent places that I frequent for the same type of thing.  The main flavor shouldn't be a corn tortilla. 

Overall, the place was ok and a little on the pricey side for what you get.  Really nice staff, clean, and a decent location makes me want to give it another try."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, food was made to order and excellent!  Found this place on Yelp, so glad we came in!!  We will be back for more shrimp tacos.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Newly opened gem In Surprise! This is a family owned and operated restaurant. Felix runs the show and is such a friendly, honest, & hard working guy. Very relaxed and low key atmosphere. We have a family of six and have gone many, many times and each and every dish is delicious! It's important to us to support local small businesses, and this is one we hope stays around. A new staple for our family. We love this authentic taco shop, they also have a secret menu."}
{"text":"Favorite place for tacos not only in Surprise, but the entire west valley. Have been twice this week. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Mexican food is excellent and food is very fresh and it was delicious I'll be back,,it's next to sprouts on bell rd..."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Casa De Papa. New to Surprise so we thought that we would give it a try.
The employee at the register was very friendly. That is a big plus. The tacos were ok. 
Buy a bottled drink. The fountain drink was undrinkable. The place looks pretty good. I like the pretty menu board."}
{"text":"Finally some excellent potato tacos on the west side: crispy, savory, with cheese and pico. Never had a mulita before, it's like a deluxe quesadilla, very good. My kids are sometimes picky eaters, they both like the tacos and one really likes the mulitas. The specials add a drink and tortilla chips for a good deal. Very friendly staff and service, very clean and relaxed restaurant."}
{"text":"So-where to begin. Cherry coke from the fountain tasted weird. The red and green sauces for the chips had no flavor. Fish taco had no flavor. Carne asada in the taco was grisly.  Carnitas taco was very dry. Beans were dried out. Rice was ok, not great but not horrible. My husband said the steak in his surf and turf burrito was chewy. The tacos and burrito were very large with a lot of meat. That was about the only good part of the meal. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Yesterday my daughters two friends and I went on a taco hunt (she's away at college so I take them out from time to time); trying tacos from different places all over the valley. We went to about 10 different places, and this was our last stop. At each place, we got the lowest cost taco. A trend was beginning to build that the lower the cost of the taco, the better it was. When we looked at the receipt and realized these were the most expensive of all, we were concerned they'd taste the worst- which was disappointing at first. However, much to our dismay, they were the best ones. We were beyond stuffed from eating so many tacos, but we definitely ate the whole thing. We tried the carne asada taco, and it was generously filled. The soft corn taco shells were warmed, and we had just the right amount of fresh salsa. The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender. This was the only location we sat in (we went through the drive thru for everyone else). The girl at the register was really sweet. We told her what we'd spent the day doing and she thought it was so fun (it really is!). I hope they are around for a long time- the location isn't the greatest (pretty tucked behind everything) and I'd hate to have them meet the demise of Samurai Sam's because of it."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened about 1.5 months ago and it looks like it's here to stay! Cashier was extremely nice and the cooks are accommodating. They don't have a fish burrito on the menu but they made one for my fiancée any way. My girl loved it! I ordered the grilled shrimp and grilled fish tacos. Both are on your average sized corn tortilla so I was surprised that they doubled the tortilla considering they don't have the very tiny version. The shrimp taco had cheese which made it extremely tasty. The grilled fish was white fish and blended well with the veggies and salsas. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. Drink choices are horchata, jamaica, Coca-Cola fountain and Mexican bottled drinks. They also give you free tortilla chips to enjoy with the various salsa options. 

Next time we come, I want to try the mulitas and steak and potato burrito."}
{"text":"This was a great Mexican restaurant in surprise Arizona. The food was well-kept and eagerly awaited our attention. Spices were great and the sauce was good too, we had lots of sauce on our nachos. The nachos nachos came out first and then the meal. It was a 5 Star meal really good, we loved it.  They bring the food out to the table and you don't have to do anything except order and that's good for me."}
{"text":"First of all, food was just good. My daughter's quesadilla was not all the way melted- it was only melted around the edges. My mulita, which is like a quesadilla but not folded, was also not melted in the center. We were the only people there, so there was no rush or anything.

Besides that, which isn't terrible, the food portions are really small. It is not at all reasonably priced for the size. I had the carne asada mulita. It was just a little bigger than a street taco, no bigger than my hand, and was over $7! You don't even get chips! They don't have any combinations or anything, so if you want to buy several street tacos, as my husband did, you're paying $10 or more. It was almost $21 for a kids meal, a mulita, and 2 tacos. For that price, we could have gone almost anywhere else- certainly Chipotle or Caramba's. This place does not compete in value, in my opinion. Taste-wise, it was fine. But we will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on Saturday because it popped up on Yelp. We ordered 3 Tacos Each. I got a Coconut Shrimp, Carnitas, and a Carne Asada. The Coconut Shrimp Taco was hands down the best Shrimp Taco I've ever had. It was freshly cook, crispy, and had amazing flavor. The Carnitas was a close second. Excellent smokey flavor and really tender, not tough at all. The Carne Asada was ok. The pieces of meat were a little on the small side but they did put a lot in there so that was ok. The guy behind the counter was SUPER friendly and even gave us a card for $10 off our next Uber Eats. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but you don't get much bang for your buck. For about $20 I got a burrito and my bf got 2 tacos. They were rather small. We were both still hungry when we left. The burrito was supposed to have cheese and guacamole. I didn't find any cheese and I came across the tiniest smidge of guacamole at the very end. It was kind of bland, mostly potatoes, but the few pieces of steak were good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it tasted like my grandma had made it. This is seriously some of the best Mexican food I've ever had and is way cheaper than filiburtos or anywhere else in the area. Definitely my new go to place for carne Asada tacos"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on Labor Day around noontime because I was craving a Carne Asada burrito. I wanted to try this place out as I have never been before. The place was clean and there were only two ladies talking about life issues who seemed to be enjoying the food. Walked up to the counter and the lady there was very friendly. I took a look at their menu board and saw what I had came for but
another item grabbed my attention.  It was a taco with coconut shrimp with mango Pico de Gallo ($3.89). I had to try it. FIVE STARS on this one. It was so good. The coconut shrimp was breaded nicely and the shrimp was firm and pleasant. There was no soggyness just loads of flavor. See the pics, yum. The carne asada was good ($7.19), but after having that coconut shrimp taco, everything else in my book at that  point took a back seat. I will definitely be back. Hope you all will give this a try as well."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Excellent street tacos. Portions are small enough to pick more than one taco (~$3 each). I tried both the shrimp and carne asada tacos (menu has several more options) and thoroughly enjoyed both! Shrimp comes with a nice slaw, and the carne asada was tender and full of flavor. My mom and I were only disappointed that they had totally sold out of fish tacos after running a special the night before. We had come in specifically for those, but I'm sure there will be another time! 

The place itself is small and pretty low-key. Food is served quickly and in paper trays -- so think quick for lunch rather than a fancy dinner. Authentic kinda flavor in neighborhood that is usually just full of chain-style, cookie-cutter restaurants. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fish Tacos were excellent !!!! Very fresh and the special sauce was refreshing."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. Terrible service and below average food. Overpriced and small portions for \"gourmet \" tacos"}
{"text":"I got the surf n' turf burrito. It was amazing. The steak was really tender and the guacamole sauce was good.

The employees were really friendly and the salsas were just the right level of spicy.. We will definitely be back for the Friday fish taco special."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Bland. Even the \"hot sauce\" is bland. I won't be back. I doubt if this place will still be there through the summer."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! My family of 6 loved it.  We had fish tacos-there Friday special We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Mexico and have had quite a few tacos in my day. These are by far the best in Phoenix. Made to order great flavor and most of all, all of the ingredients are super fresh. They have a rotating special everyday that varies. It's a good value with two tacos a drink and chips for about $6 something. You have to stop in if in the area. I've been raving about these to everyone"}
