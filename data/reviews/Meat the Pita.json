{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma was stellar and the onion rings were beer battered to perfection; plus they left no grease on my fingers."}
{"text":"Meat the pita is as authentic as you can get to  delicious Lebanese food. This is a solid lunch and dinner spot. 

I first tried the labneh with pita chips. The labneh was made with a strained yogurt and I used it as a dip with my pita chips. It was perfect for a hot Arizona day when hummus can be too thick and dry at times! I also ordered the chicken shawarma meal. The meal came with an ample amount of fries and a drink, which was great because I love fries! The chicken shawarma was very tender and well marinated. 

I highly recommend Meat the Pita !"}
{"text":"When it comes to authentic shawarma nobody does it better than the Lebanese. I have been on the hunt for that savoury taste and I have finally found it. Meat the pita delivers excellent food quality and a great ambience. As authentic as you could imagine. Everything from their chicken to their beef to their falafal is exquisite. Definitely keeps you craving to want to come back for more.Will be following this truck around for sure! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Meat the Pita serves the finest authentic Lebanese food that I've had in the United States. Their shawarma sandwiches are capable of delivering a warm feeling of nostalgia and boy are they mighty tasty. I ordered a chicken shawarma platter and chose the french fries as my side (rice is also an option). It was served with a delicious garlic sauce that you can dip your sandwich or fries into. I was incredibly satisfied with the first sandwich and felt enticed to order another. So I did! I decided to go with the beef shawarma and I do not regret that decision whatsoever. There is a vegetarian falafel option on the menu that I have my eye set on for the next time I can stop by. I would highly recommend this food truck to anyone looking for some appetizing, authentic Mediterranean cuisine!"}
{"text":"As a gentleman of Lebanese descent I was eager to see what this food truck dubbed Meat the Pita had in store for me. Having tasted the best of what Mediterranean food has to offer back in the homeland, a handful of restaurants that serve this type of food in the state of Arizona have failed to measure up to my expectations. After ingesting this truck's food, I feel confident to say that any other Mediterranean restaurant in the state can screw off. Meat the Pita is as authentic and delicious as it gets.

The first item I ordered in order to quell my stomach-burning hunger was the chicken shawarma sandwich. Additionally I ordered a side of French fries and some garlic sauce as a dip. So tasty was this sandwich I thought my taste buds were going to explode into Jupiter and back. The finery of toasted pita bread and marinated chicken went extraordinarily well with those crispy fries and creamy garlic sauce. But wait, there is more. The hunger dragon had yet to be slain, so I had requested another item on the menu as a weapon to get the job done and rescue the kingdom that was my body. That weapon was the beef shawarma sandwich. Let me tell you, my taste buds were simply overwhelmed with delectable intricacies. The garnishes, the tarator sauce, the marinated beef, all into an amalgamation of prodigious flavor. It truly felt like I was eating at a stand in Beirut. This pleasant experience was bolstered by the speed of service, as the wait time was below 10 minutes.

To reiterate, if you're looking for some tasty, authentic Lebanese food, Meat the Pita is highly recommended. I am not easily impressed by Mediterranean food here yet this food truck exceeded my expectations through the roof. Give it a shot, it's worth it. I give Meat the Pita 5 stars and I will certainly be returning for more."}
{"text":"Like a couple other reviewers, I tried this food truck when it came to my office. The menu that we were offered was limited and definitely did not seem to be their full menu.

I got a chicken shawarma pita, which turned out to be a skinny little pita wrap that only had chicken and pickles in it, nothing else. They charged me $8-$9 for this. Because their overpriced pita came with no sides, I also ordered onion rings - which were $4. I was given a total of 5 rings.

These two items were only decent tasting at best, but my colleague ordered fries and they were oversalted, almost to the point of being inedible.

Verdict: not worth the money. They skimp you on food and what little you do get isn't even that good."}
{"text":"I'm not someone who typically leaves reviews, but Meat the Pita deserves nothing less. THEIR CHICKEN SHAWARMA WAS AMAZING. Their food was fabulous for all and clearly was prepared with the best of ingredients. I will be back again, and next time I will bring friends!"}
{"text":"This place has the one of the best chicken shawarmas around the area. In addition, they have the best falafil wraps as well. I highly recommend it and I think it is worth a try! Their service is also really good. You would not have to wait much for your order and they present the food in a cleaner and a nicer way than most of the other food trucks."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great customer service, food comes out fast. Best of all... It is so delicious! You can tell that they put a lot of time and heart when creating the food. They all wear gloves and hair nets, very sanitary."}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma and it was amazing. Best shawarma I've tried hands down. Nice friendly staff, fast service, and great atmosphere. I will be coming again to try their falafel which looks delicious."}
{"text":"If you see this food truck and are even remotely hungry--go there. They came to my apartment complex for food truck Thursday, I had a pita wrap and it was AMAZING. Absolutely delicious food, everyone working there was friendly, I just finished eating and I'm considering going back for more. 

This isn't knock off imitation food, it's a family business run by people from Lebanon. It doesn't get more authentic than that. If you haven't tried it, you need to!"}
{"text":"The food was great and we had a great time!! I loved the salad, the sauce was authentic and perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent food! They came to my office in Tempe and the food was great. They didn't skimp on portion size and the quality of the ingredients was top notch. I would definitely eat at their truck again and welcome them back to my office anytime!"}
{"text":"They came to our office today, somewhat late but probably because it was their first time here. Our order took a rather long time than usual, but we were given complementary onion rings while we wait. I must say that the beer battered onion rings were made to perfection!
The garlic fries were so delicious that you didn't need any sauce to enjoy them and the chicken falafel was quite good too. I hope to see them again and with more variety and definitely Hummus on the menu."}
{"text":"Over-the-top service, pride in one's work, family operated, authentic, delicious... Can't say enough about the place. Just go find the truck closest to you and you'll see."}
