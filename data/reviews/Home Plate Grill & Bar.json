{"text":"I eat here often...food is good, waitresses are always friendly.  They have a new waitress, Sandra, who was really awesome...she really took the time to help me with the menu, as if she really DOES eat there!  I always come back to this place...their food is like comfort food to me now!"}
{"text":"Really cool place, just outside of town before the freeway. Awesome baseball memorabilia if you're into nostalgia like that....but most importantly, price, food and service. It's an authentic diner that has a sports bar just separated from a nice dining area if you want it quiet or have kids. We were treated really great by the server, Jazmin. Super nice and fast!"}
{"text":"The Good: Awesome Burgers and Great Pizza, Nice atmosphere, Lots of TV's for watching sports.

The Not-So-Good: Sometimes (Not all the time!) some of the female bartenders, NOT ALL!, are too busy flirting with the gamers and their friends, that my friends and I have been put on ignore for way too long. 
We have walked in and have sat there for 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged at all. We have sat there for 5-10 minutes with empty glasses before being asked \"Would you like another?\" 
There's been times when I've had too wave my hand and say \"excuse me\" in order to get noticed and get some service, whether it be to order a drink or food.

I understand that flirting with the lonely guys to make them think they might have a shot at getting some action so they'll keep pumping $20's into the machines is part of their job but so is providing good service to everyone.
The best bartender they ever had, IMO, was Jesse. She always showed us a good time simply by laughing, joking around, and making conversation."}
{"text":"I was out delivering presents today and stop at home plate to get something to eat. I ordered a double cheeseburger with avocado and the sriracha french fries. James the bartender took my order and told me it was a big burger and I told him I had a big appetite. When the burger showed up I look at it and realize I would not be able to eat all of it because it was such a big burger. To my surprise the burger was the best burger I've ever eaten and the fries were even better than I expected. I figured I'd eat as much of it as I could but to my surprise I ate all of it and was stuffed. I live on the westside about 19 miles away and I will find reasons to go back to the home plate because the food and the service was top-notch. I challenge anybody and everybody to find a better Burger than they have at home plate. If I could give them 10 Stars I would."}
{"text":"This review is for this one specific visit I had on Saturday 1/25/14. I used to visit Home Plate on a regular basis to watch hockey because they have good size TVs and you get your personal speaker at your table for the tv you're watching.

I have to say that I'm not a fan of the server Amber. She was not happy to be there and made every small request seem like a big deal. Obviously she doesn't remember me being a regular from before! I asked her to change the channel, and assumed she would bring me a speaker. She had a little bit of an attitude when I made the request, because apparently she wasn't \"my server\". This has been her attitude since the first time I went there.

My server (short blonde, didn't get a name) was a sweetheart. Since there were only 2 servers in the dining room and it was pretty busy with parties, I wasn't too upset that I wasn't shown too much attention. (Plus I was watching the game, so I wasn't worried about the speedy service.) The food was good and the atmosphere is always nice. Probably won't go back any time soon since I live in the northwest, especially if I'm risking having Amber as my server."}
{"text":"Terrible place to watch a game.  Gamblers chain  smoking at the bar and playing video games.  Filling up the whole place with disgusting cigarette smoke.  Neon signs hung all around the bar making it difficult to see any of the thousand tv screens due to the neon glare.  Only bright spot?  The wings were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This place is very casual and more of a bar atmosphere, but they do have a separate non-smoking are that is really nice.

Their wings are awesome.  You have to try and garlic parmesan.  Best garlic-flavored wings I have ever had.

If you have room, get the Zeppoles. Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was great, prices were ok.  Didn't have any food, just there to watch a basketball game.  Soccer game was on, so boyfriend was happy.  No sound on the tvs, though, so that was disappointing.  Also pretty smoky and noisy, probably because it was a Friday night.  Looks like a good bar if that's what you're looking for"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The bartenders did a great job and the food was amazing. If you want some great pizza this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"A bar is a bar right? But man, this place has the best burgers for a bar. Seems like no matter what time I step into this place, it's always busy. Check in on Yelp and get a free order of garlic knots. The garlic knots are interesting, it's more like a funnel cake loaded with garlic rather than the dough ball most pizza joints give you. I just remember my stomach hurting afterwards so never again. But the burgers are definitely worth it. I've had other stuff here and it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"I came in to try out the bar and play video poker. We are moving to a house close to this place and I thought it may be a great go to place once we move. I was basically ignored the whole time and my drinks were not refilled. I lost about $60 in video poker, which is fine, but I would have been less bummed if I had been offered another drink. It was not busy at the bar, either."}
{"text":"1st time there enjoyed,very fun loved all the Tv's.  Could not have asked for a better waitress Ashley was wonderful let me try garlic knots great service. Very friendly and fun. Food wonderful. Bringing friends and family again hopefully will get Ashley again!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on our way home ... and boy we're so happy we did !! The cheese pizza was amazing !!! I also had the Caesar salad while  my friend had breakfast . She loved her food as well ! Glad we decided to go off the strip ."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, and it's basically my neighborhood bar. Everyone treats me nice, and the food is always good. It's not over-priced at all. They also have baseball stuff all over the wall, some of the stuff looks signed. Gives it a nice feel."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and great atmosphere. I come here all the time."}
{"text":"Pizza buffet after 3am is incredible. I live in summerlin and make the drive to the plate at least once a week. Love everything about the place. Grave bartenders Joey V and Dan are awesome!

Spider time!"}
{"text":"Home Plate is back!! Always loved the pizza at the blue diamond location.  Just tried it out and was still yummy.  Can't wait for those ovens to get as seasoned as their old location.  Good to see Shannon is still here.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great time at Home Plate. Shannon,  Jessi, and Joe are awesome.  No matter what time I am in there they take care of me. Great food and cold beer."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, at least once a week. You need to come down and say hi to my favorite waitresses Ashley and Amber. They are the best in the business and the food is second to none."}
{"text":"I've gone 35 years without food poisoning until I ate here 3 weeks ago. I've been begging my wife to go here with me and she finally caved. I ordered the philly. The female bartender took our order and brought our check. No interaction period. Was given a side of mayo that was warm and discolored yellow. 3 days of pure hell followed this sandwich.  Will NEVER go here again. I don't care if I get free garlic knots for life."}
{"text":"I work nights so im always looking for a good place to unwind after work. Since this homeplate opened its my favorite place to stop for a drink and something to eat late night. The menu has plenty of options, everything comes out quickly and tastes great. They have more than just your typical bar food, staff makes great recommendations-salads and salmon are amazing- when in the mood for pizza and wings homeplate has me covered as well!"}
{"text":"Home plate!!  You would think put on a baseball playoff game before football. NOPE!! Better off renaming this place Inn Zone!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for the whole family.  Our kids really loved it there!!  Ashley was our server and she was very attentive.  The food was awesome!!  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"For my first (and likely only) visit, I ordered a small pizza.  For nearly $11, I was expecting something slightly bigger, but I decided that if it was a truly good pie, it'd be worth it.  Not so.

It was fairly busy, so getting the bartender's attention was a challenge.  While I was waiting, I noticed the Lobster Zone game, which is just so depressing that I almost left before I even picked up my order.

It's too dark inside for me to comment fairly on cleanliness, but I did catch wind of an odor that I can only describe as sweaty.

As for the pizza, it was nothing special at all.  The sauce was OK, but the burnt crust and virtually tasteless toppings conspired to ruin my pizza.

Quite honestly, my last visit to Papa John's was more satisfying.  And I NEVER thought I'd say that!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The food, the drinks, the servers especially the bartenders!  The pizza is great. The beef tips are sooooo good. My husband loves the pork chops and the Italian omelet.  The chicken fingers are great also. The machines are usually cooperative.  Thank you to Kasey for getting me spoiled."}
{"text":"love going there after work to get my favorite dish and 3 beers just to unwinded. I would always sit at the bar but the vapors kill me . please put a sign up no vapors !!! so anyways I sit in a booth bye my self non smoking area . met Ashley the waitress . what a cutie pie . so sweet. and the service is awesome . she makes my night before I go home . so when my family is all off together were there once a week but I go 2 times a week just to chill after work . but if the tvs went to Samsung I would be the 5 times a week maybe 7 haha"}
{"text":"Fantastic environment comfortable.  Great menu and outstanding food would recommend to anyone.  The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu The home made brownies were incredible! This is the dessert you can't stop eating!!"}
{"text":"Food is great and such a wide selection - everyone will find something they love.  Plus they have very friendly service.  They have also managed to combine sports bar with family friendly - not easy to do."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, and my favorite part of this bar..... RONDA!!!! I will always come back here to see her, she makes the experience incredible every.single.time."}
{"text":"Love this bar!

DRINK: This is a great bar to go to late nights or during sports games to just chill and drink. Offer all the basic alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

FOOD: The food here tastes ten times better than what it looks like. I was hesitant to order food, but I'm glad I did. I highly recommend the beef sliders to everyone. The meat is very moist, tasty grilled onions is included, and the bun has the perfect texture. They have very good pizza on their menu. The shrimp scampi is made to perfection and has a large portion.

ATMOSPHERE: It looks like any other bar, but the customers and workers make this place fun. The bar tender and chef were super friendly. Great place to go to on a Saturday night:)"}
{"text":"Best swing shift bartender in town! I'm never off for swing shit because I work in restaurants myself. Ronda is the BEST bartender in these parts and always has been. She always reads our minds and gives us the most attentive service. We love you RONDA !!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's my go to bar. A local bar in the big city. Bar tenders are always friendly. They take the time to talk to you and get to know what you like. Say hi to Kasey, Rhonda and James when you stop by. Always a good mix of people. Found?  Yeah, it's fantastic. Any time of the day or night. And I've been here in the middle of the night, so I'd know. Great TV set up for watching sports, too. And, if you're visiting, it's close to the airport so you can stop in on your way out. I don't gamble, but they have a lot of games if you do. Do your self a favor and check Home Plate out!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed all of our food sit in the dinning room to have a relaxing dinner. Rachael was our server and We wish we had servers like her more often she was running around making sure everyone is taken care of and refilled or drinks multiple times She was constantly checking in on us to see how we were and our meal was. Kudos Rachael! We had the sampler Appetizer and I had a pizza and my partner ate the Bacon Philly all was extremely good ."}
{"text":"Spent $63 on our food and this is what I got for zucchini sticks.. little crumbs that look like clearly it was the end of the frozen bag. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I always stop in here when im on this side of town. Ive always had great service at the bar. Plus, Jessie rocks her bar shifts. Everytime ive eaten here the food has been pretty good and left full. I usually get Epifanny as a server and she is very attentive and good to talk to. I would hang out here more if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Our grandsons' favorite place. The arcade keeps them happy and they can win prizes. Pretty good food, though not spectacular."}
{"text":"My first time at Home Plate. Our server Ashley was great! She made sure we had full drinks!"}
{"text":"So so on the items listed for the happy hour. But food is always good & made to order"}
{"text":"I was there for a graveyard shift on friday, Daniel the bartender on shift was on point. He was fun and great to talk with, we played a little money and even though we didnt win Daniel told us about the pizza and pasta buffet that started at 3am. 
The food was good and the atmosphere is friendly. Its a great local bar and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awsome pizza my girl says its better then grimaldi's heading there now for some pizza and wings and a large Newcastle"}
{"text":"We love Home Plate. We are repeat customers. The pizza and garlic knots are delicious. We have only had 1 bad experience and that was with service. It took 45m to get our check and we never got 1 refill. But we have not seen that server there the past couple times we have been there. We always recommend this place and can't wait until our son grows up and we can play all the arcade games!"}
{"text":"Love this bar! My job puts me on a late night schedule. My girlfriends and I always feel safe coming here for an after gig drink or bite. Service is always great, the bartenders always make us feel so welcome. The menu has a lot to offer. Usually I go for the chicken fingers (which are really good), but I've started a health kick this week and I appreciated being able to order a healthy meal during graveyard hours last night."}
{"text":"Shannon is a great bar tender and took amazing care of us today! Food and drink were awesome!"}
{"text":"Too bad Re-Pete's has closed. The building is the only thing that remains the same with the nice dining room (seperate from the bar) and clean restrooms. The menu is bland too big and way too pricey for bar food. It pales in the shadow of the previous kitchen fare. Even the draft beers have been changed. As our waitress said \"Wadda gonna do\"...I said 'Go to a different place' with that she shrugged and so did we. Adios 

Oh almost for got about the food....grilled shrimp appetizer; too few for the $$$, Pepperoni/olive pizza; burnt crust. Sliders; overcooked, dried out and the patty melt; not much bigger than the sliders/greasy. The fries were fresh and hot."}
{"text":"home plate was ok I tried it for the first time about a week ago nothing special but the server was really nice and the food was just ok the burger looked good though"}
{"text":"Just did my first yelp check in off here, which was 6 garlic knots for free. They were pretty good except the garlic left my breath reaking. Maybe if they used roasted garlic instead it would be better. But they were pretty good. Sat at the bar and the bartender was really hospitable."}
{"text":"What a cute place and GREAT service! My bf and I went here the first time to just try the pizza, we are cheese pizza taste testers :) anyway.....
Sue is sooooooo nice she welcomes us as family when we go in and always knows that we want garlic knots.
Prices are good, staff is super sweet and food is always better than \"your typical bar food\".
I like the way the bar area has glass around it so the smoke does not travel into the dining area. Game area is fun, skeet ball etc. you get tickets to win prizes, like an small, adult, Chuck E. Cheese :)
Could update their TV's to flat panels in the dining area, but other than that.......this place is great!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we have eaten here, so we decided to stop in and try it again.  Sure glad we did, the waitresses were friendly and quick to get our drinks.  Had a great selection of happy hour specials and anxious to try them the next time we go.  The pizza was great as was the wings.  This might just become our goto place during the week.  Thanks Home Plate enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the pizza. Once they get their new pizza oven seasoned, it will be the best in town. Food is good but I come for the drinks and atmosphere. This is definitely the best bar in the southwest. I live all of the bartenders but Shannon is by far got to be one of the best in town. She is super attentive with drinks and always takes good care of us. Definitely will become a regular here."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.   The food is more upscale then traditional bar food and Ashley is always welcoming,  quick and just a good person.   If you remember the show cheers then you'll love this place because everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"My friend  and I came into this bar because of the reviews they received. So, we decided to check the place out since they changed the name. We came in for a few drinks and some food. When we walked in, the bar was full, so we figured we'd just sit at a booth/table. we were excited to try this place out plus it was busy so it must be popular. Well, we sat at a booth in plain sight 2 tables down from this other big party. My friend and I chatted for 10 minutes then I thought, geez is there a waitress ? And as soon as I said that she walked around the corner, I was looking her way but she just totally ignored me, I said, \"excuse me\" and she turned and went the other way. I decided to wait a bit longer, another 15 minutes went by. Still nothing. So my friend got up and grabbed menus herself from the side of the bar. We sat there for another 15 minutes, with no one acknowledging our presences. Then we got upset, my friend had to go to the bar and ask if anyone was going to serve us and they said, oh, we thought you were taken care of? ........ Really? We've been here for 40 minutes with not one person making eye contact with us and nothing but a menu on the table. That was the most annoying part, the 40minute wait. But after we ordered the food, it came out quickly and was fine. Then my friend asked for another beer and she left and forgot about it, she had to ask the bartender to get her another beer. Well finally they brought out one for me and one for her, even though I didn't want another one. She said she assumed that since my friend wanted one so did I. I told her no, but then she said it was already poured so it's fine. I thanked her, because that was kind. When it's was time to leave we asked for separate checks, I told her what was mine and she said, \"I remember\". So the first check was messed up. The second  time was also messed up, she charged me for 2 beers even though it was supposed to be one. She said she'd fix it again, but I was over it at this point. I guess you have to sit at the bar if you want service. I had wings and it was good. The service was not so great, like at all."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love this locals spot. Good drink specials, pizza, wings and garlic knots are out of this world. I had an opportunity to meer the owner Glen and he is the definition of hospitality. A must try if you are nearby and want to catch a Game!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. I'll never be back here. I sat at the bar for a good 15 mins and gambled $60 I had to approach the bartender for my drink And never once did she asked me if I wanted another. Happy hr says it ends at 7 on their website, I get here and I'm informed it ends at 6. The website also says they have wireless volume box for the games and that's not true. The staff have no idea what I was taking about when I asked about it. 

Really disappointed in this place. I was really looking forward to finding a new place to have a few drinks and a good time."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday.

Great waitress though I do not remember her name?  

Dicing of course

The die instructed me to order a drink of my choice so I had a blood mary, it was great, perfectly made!    Cucumbers and lemon wedges included.   :)   

The die instructed my ex to get the ham steak breakfast and he loved it--very juicy!

I had the vanilla cinnamon french toast w/2 eggs and wow, it was amazing!     6 wedges, they do not let you leave hungry for sure!

We will be back but want to try it for dinner next!"}
{"text":"Great service and great pizza! Came here with my uncle and mom for a late dinner and it was pretty good! Sat at the bar and the bartender Jill was very personable and took of everything that we needed. If I were ever back in the area, I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time!  Ashlee our server  was awesome.  Had the Calamari Fries. Ashlee brought us 3 dipping sauces!  We also had the basket of Onion Rings.    Then I had the biggest burger that was cooked to perfection!  Carlos had the Shrimp Scampi!  Everything was on point!  Down to the beers.  Tequila and jagermeister!   Also liked that I could control the music via phone and TouchTunes!   Great time.  Ashlee was the bomb!"}
{"text":"The best bar this side of the Mississippi! Great atmosphere and amazing team! I'll be here all the time!"}
{"text":"I'm currently about to head there again for the second time this week. The best food in Vegas is not even on the Strip, it's right here and I feel bad for people who don't know about this. Prices are fair and the food is so delicious. I can't even explain. I remember when I was a kid and my mom would cook for me, she'd say \"I put the special ingredient\" which meant she put LOVE. I feel this place puts a lot of that special ingredient because food is never bad here. Whoever the chef is, thank you for blessing my stomach with your art. See you in about an hour. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly, clean and generous. The 6yo ninja got the cheese pizza and gave it good marks. My Hawaiian sub was sweet and spicy, and the fries were a highlight. Bloody Mary was terrific."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with great Pizza.  I usually get a large pizza to-go and I am always happy with it.  Good Ranch dressing and friendly employees.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this bar , GREAT food with decent service.  Big glasses of tapped beer and good prices/deals"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome. 
Home plate favorite. Chicken avocado cheese omlete outstanding."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!  The food is good and love the garlic knots. Ashley is the best waitress and makes your dining there a wonderful experience.  Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Don't go on fight night here, terrible service in the restaurant area. Lady decides to charge us ten dollars after waiting for service to get beer for like 30 mins. Then gets an attitude when we asked her why are you charging us now when there is one fight left. Plus we had to walk up to the bar to get a beer, but on a good note guy bartender was on top of his game came right up to us and great attitude. Won't be back here for ufc."}
{"text":"A fun place to hang out.  Food is Great!! Especially the Burgers.  Haven't had a chance to try the pizza.  but I hear it is AMAZING!!!.  Next time.  

They have a $20 Match Play and Food coupons in VALPAK (The Blue Envelope)"}
{"text":"Been here before for drinks and bites and their apps are pretty darn good for bar food so soon after I came back to pick up a pizza for dinner and it too was pretty darn good. Tonight I phoned in an ordered the \"Famous Chili Verde burrito\" which comes with rice pilaf, corn and chips. Pretty good and pretty spicy. I wish it was a little bit warmer but other then that it was just ok I would try something else next time not to crazy about it to hurry and order it again it was about $11.99 the chips on the other hand was bomb! 

My wife got the Crispy chicken ranch wrap which she ordered it with wheat tortilla and we added bacon for $1.50 but I guess it was suppose to be a $2 add on. In the end there was only 1 maybe 2 and that's a BIG maybe stripes of bacon that we were able to fine in the whole wrap. She too said it was ok and nothing she would run back for. The fries that came with it was suppose to be season fries with season salt which was almost non existence and was very boring. It was about $10 on the other hand we have ordered the fries before with wings and they were pretty good. It might just have been an off night. Side note we checked in and got free garlic knots FREE and they we soooooo bomb!!! 

Other then the food the bar is a bar lots of smoke, dark, space to drink and eat but the food side it great for families. It is clean with games, TVs and smoke free zone. Service was not bad but not great either because I ask what the togo charge was on the receipt she had no idea. She just told me she didn't know and that it just automatically does that....ok I guess? So all in all not a bad place and I will return but there are other bars near by that I might give a go first before coming back. 

I yet have to find out why and what the $1 to go charge is for."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've visited the new Home Plate since they moved locations and I've gotta say nothing has changed...which is a great thing. The food is still fabulous, the atmosphere is awesome, especially if you want to watch sports. It hasn't changed and I'm happy with that."}
{"text":"pizza let me tell you PIZZA late night the best. Let's not forget if you wanna laugh there is one of the funniest bartenders around.  There's a jukebox with over 37,000 songs so you never have to play the same one twice or 8 times...."}
{"text":"Just met the new bartender he called himself Danimal at first I thought he was weird , but then I realized I was just being rude because he was gosh darn sexier then me. He poured drinks like a man with bubble guts driving home (f ing FAST)! Now I know why he's called Danimal cause he's a beast! AMAZBALLS !"}
{"text":"Beef tips are insane!!! Heres a tip get em on the nachos i almost lost my  marbles... the food here is a journey through flavor town and i dont ever wanna leave.  Also theres a jukebox with damn near 40000 songs and every genre is covered youd be hard pressed not to find multiple songs to play."}
{"text":"Went there randomly one night and omg they're giving away pizza in the middle of the night... Who does that?  Ummm also the pizza is delicious.  I played skee ball til my arm damn near fell off... This place rules."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner there and the service was not great at all, it took them 20 minutes to finally acknowledge I was there and asked if I wanted a menu. I ordered sliders and a drink, it had nothing special to it, the food is less than average. I would rather go to BJs down the street on Decatur than bother going there again. Waste of time, waste of money."}
{"text":"Awesome food and bartenders are very friendly and would recommend the boracho wrap it's awesome 


Keep up the good work  


This location is open 6/27/2016"}
{"text":"Service was great.Will be back again.Pizza was really fantastic.Bar tender(Jessi) was the bomb.She was very friendly,atentative,and totally cool.She definitely knows what she is doing.Great Job!    Tim B."}
{"text":"I come here on my way home for the amazing food and bomb diggity service. What can I say, the pizza is on point and it's not a ridiculous price. Plus the bartender Joe always remembers my name and what I want. I'm so happy they finally opened this place back up considering I used to go to the old location atleast once a week. If you want to have some fun and get the best pizza in town..you HAVE to stop here."}
{"text":"I never knew where this place was, but I came here to visit a bartender buddy and check it out.

The first things that stood out was that this bar is pretty spacious and has a lot of windows letting in natural light as opposed to the dark, closed in depressing bars and i like that it feels like i have room between me and the next person.

The food (I had wings) i thought was well presented and very good in taste. The pizza which someone near me had ordered smelled amazing and made me wish i ordered one as well.

The service here was pretty attentive and that is getting rarer these days.

The machines gave me a fair amount of play instead of just quickly soaking up my money.....that makes for a fun time.

I had fun here, I think it's a nice place to chill- too bad it's not closer to my house."}
{"text":"Well this was a unique experience to put it simply. Located just off Las Vegas blvd behind the boot barn is this sports themed dive bar/resteraunt. Upon walking in you can choose to go left or right. The left door takes you to the dinning room with a glass wall that separates from the bar area, which is thru the right door.

In either room there are tv's posted with the latest game on and sports memorabilia as wall decor. Now the concept of having a separate dining space is a great idea! If it didn't stink of smoke.

I sat at an off kilter table, for the night we ordered a very dry Philli cheese steak with fries and a obviously canned corn beef and hash plate. Towards the end of our meal we were given a ticket for a raffle. I don't know if we won anything as we left when a loud screeching came on the intercom and lasted until we left. Apparently that happens EVERYTIME they try to switch from music to a hand held microphone. (I attached a video for your audio pleasure. Turn the volume down on your device...)

So take this place for what it is, low brow dive bar. If you like that and dont have high expectations then it's fine. If you expect a little more quality Outback Steakhouse is right down the street."}
{"text":"The Plus: If you check in on Yelp you receive 6 free garlic knots. The garlic knots have a nice crust on the outside and a doughy center. I enjoyed these.

I ordered the Stromboli and it was pretty good. I told the server light cheese. I would have wished that the center of the Stromboli would have been hotter though. They could have left it in the oven for another few minutes.

The Not So Plus: The tables, menus...the restaurant...could use some cleaning. One menu on the table had a glob of marinara sauce on it. The other card stock menu on the table was pretty worn and dirty as well. 

The service was just okay. All in all, I don't see myself returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.... I have searched and searched and searched for a place that not only is a great bar, but a comfortable place with delicious food and a feeling like Cheers....  well I found it!!.., going into home plate you get the feeling instantly of family and being at home. I always look forward to walking in the door and getting a sincere welcome. Shannon at the bar not only is a great asset but caters to you. as soon as I walk In ..she always will have what I drink ready without any questions. She always has a welcoming smile and greeting that I could never get anywhere else.... the whole staff is amazing, and the food is hands down always a 10!!!!!!  
I always know exactly where I want to be.... this place is literally My Homeplate!!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who has been harrassed by 'Joe V.' of Home Plate for a bad review you can find him and confront him in person at the foxtail pool @ SLS his full name is Joseph John Valdez. Good luck facing all the people you have harrassed over the years for a bad review, Joe!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about Home Plate is that it is family friendly on the dining side and perfectly \"bar\" friendly on the gaming side.  I only wish it was smoke free on both, but I know that will never happen in Vegas.  Both sides of the establishment (separated by large glass windows) have a large number of televisions... some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same.  The dining side also has a small arcade area which is PERFECT for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so.  All of the food I have had here (mostly Pizza) is excellent and the staff is friendly and good.  Definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Homeplate since it opened.  It always has great food and friendly staff.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good place for sports no smoking and very cleaned. Love it when you can watch all the sports channel."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bar since it was Villa pizza... I can tell you I'm not a fan of home plate... My server was awful... The food was worse... I see a lot of fans of bartenders on Yelp...I did not sit at the bar... I sat at one of the tables in the bar area... The waitress was completely nonexistent.. Maybe it's time I find a different place to have lunch... If you want to try some terrific food... Try The Bar on LV Blvd.... Just awesome food... Great Staff... Try the French Dip...."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I always stop by after work (which is usually about 4am) and I know I am always safe there. LOVE the graveyard bartender! He is so attentive even at the crazy hours I'm there. Food is great! You can't go wrong with the breaded zucchini sticks! If you haven't been here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"So I gave this place 5 stars before, but now I reducing it to one star.  They are NOT a sports bar.  They simply cater to their video poker players.  Went there to watch some college football and was yelled at by the bartender to cheering for our team because they said we were being too lound.  Last I checked this was a bar not a library!  Oh well, it's an epidemic here in Las Vegas with local bars.  Everyone has there head down staring at blue screens rather than talking to one another.  So Sad!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always great. Amazing Pizza. Service is exceptional. It's 24 hours and I find myself stopping in on my way home from work for food and drinks. Very comfortable atmosphere with lots of games, pool tables and TV's. So glad I found this spot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Try the filet mignon tips with lyonaisse potatoes! Ask for server Edna, she's superb!The Strombolli is huge and very very yummy!
Thank you Home Plate and Edna!"}
{"text":"The beef tips au poivre are the reason we come here. Very high quality beef at a reason ale price. We drive 20 minute for it!
Restaurant is clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Ashley is an awesome sever!!! Very friendly. Definitely coming back. The food is great too. From the Haunted Explorers!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!  

I was very sad when I puled into the parking lot and saw RePetes was gone!  Fortunately, my favorite things from the old place have been rolled into Home Plate Gill & Bar.

This is a mom & pop local place with awesome freshly made food.  One of the most popular dishes is the filet tips, which are my favorite.  We all had different meals, and everything was top notch.  Great food at great \"off strip\" prices.

As before, the service was very attentive.  Our server knew the menu backwards and forwards, and made great recommendations.

I highly recommend this place.  We will be definitely be back every time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hallelujah! 

I have been wanting to check this spot ever since it opened.  Today, I brought my 2 kids to eat in the dining room.  Our server, Elaine, was so friendly- great personality,  checked on us regularly, and even paid special attention to my toddler (that seriously means so much when we're eating out).

I ordered a beer,  chicken noodle soup,  French fries, Gabriel's Grilled Lamb Chops, and zappolis for dessert. 

Beer- Stella on draft. Cold and satisfying

Chicken noodle soup- homemade! Shredded chicken, carrots, celery, and noodles. YUMMY

French Fries- just like fresh Boardwalk fries. So good.  I had to ask for malt vinegar just to make it official :)

And now, let's talk about the Lamb Chops. First of all, I try lamb chops everywhere I go.  These were by far the best lamb chops I've had in a very long time! I ordered them medium rare with mashed potatoes. I just bit right into them and my eyes rolled to the back of my head.  Awesome. They were perfectly seasoned,  tender and just plain delicious.  The sautéed veggies and mashed potatoes went so well with everything. 

Zappolis- just like little funnel cakes at the carnival! 

I can't believe all of this amazing food came from this affordable and convenient place.  This is such a perfect spot for the family, but I seriously can't wait to have a \"grown up\" night with my friends and hang out in the bar! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had plans to go to the South Las Vegas Premium Outlets but they don't open till 11am.  Since it was still early, we decided to get something to eat.  I did a quick Yelp search and found Home Plate Grill & Bar.  I was kinda hesitant to bring my 7 year old daughter to a restaurant that has \"bar\" on the name but looking at the reviews, lots of patrons and their kids frequent this place.  We got there at 9:30am and we were the only ones and when we got done at 11am, we were still the only ones. 

Service was great (I guess it has to be since we were the only ones there), place was clean and they have a separate seating area for the restaurant and one for the bar.  We ordered the following non-breakfast items:

Linguini & Clams ($15): great flavor, lots of pasta, clams and garlic.  I really enjoyed this dish.

Winning Inning Wings ($9): Huge meaty wings, my daughter really liked them.  They came with French fries, carrots and celery. 

Milk ($3): huge glass of milk, it was easily in a 10oz cup.  

When I'm in Vegas, I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"One of the best gaming bars in town. I started coming here because of Ronda and I'm glad I did. She always makes me feel welcome and has my drink ready when I walk in the door. The food here is great, the pizza and wing combo is a great deal. Having gamblers bonus is a huge plus, one of the best gaming companies in town."}
{"text":"Service is good, the little play area for kids is a good concept. But the food was sub par at best. Maybe when came on a off day. I had buffalo chicken pizza the chicken is baked and not grilled it was mushy and the buffalo sauce had so much vinegar that the pizza was hard to eat. My wife had their salmon salad too bad it didnt taste as good as it looked. The salmon was overly fishy and served on iceberg lettuce. This place should cut back on portion size and increase the quality of the food."}
{"text":"It didn't look like much from the outside, but the inside was very nice and the food was great. The dining area and bar were separated by glass walls, which was really nice as we went as a family with kids. There wasn't a kids menu, but the menu itself has something for everyone! The wings were great! Not over breaded or too much sauce. There are several TVs with multiple games going. The bar looked pretty nice too, but we didn't check it out since we were there for dinner with the kids."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. This was my third visit. The breakfast was very good. On my previous visit I had a cheeseburger, it was also good. The service today was very good.  On another visit it was a little slow, but I will gladly wait for good food."}
{"text":"The service here is bad, the blonde old lady is incredibly rude. We had a group of 6 . She was taking our order and we weren't being slow . And she starts telling us to hurry cuz she has other tables. She was being being very rude. We enjoyed coming here for lunch, but no more, we will find somewhere else for lunch and not have to deal with the rudeness of the blonde waitress ."}
{"text":"I love this place ! Great service and food is awesome just like before. We had the buffalo Chicken Fries and was very tasty and fresh. My son loves this place kid friendly in restaurant that means a lot to a single woman."}
{"text":"I've been to Home Plate more than three different times, one decent (three star experience) and two (one star experiences).

My three star experience was well over two years ago when I went with a few friends for some beers and pizza during Sunday afternoon football.  Service was decent and the pizza was good enough for me to come back for some more.  The crust was thin, and the cheese to sauce ratio was on par, with good flavor.  We dined in the restaurant area, which was clean and comfortable.

My next experience was lackluster.  After work (3am), I stopped in to order take out.  The place had two other patrons at this time.  I was immediately greeted by the bartender and ordered a drink from him.  Remembering the last time I had their pizza, I decided to relive the experience.  So I ordered a pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni, to go.  My order was placed.  A few of the cook's friends stopped in to visit and were chatting for about a half hour.  The bartender said my pizza should be done in a few minutes.  Pretty long time to cook a pie, don't ya think?  Finally, my pie was boxed and in my arms, hallelujah!  I get home, my pizza is burnt to a crisp! Black!  I tried to scrape off the bottom of the pizza crust because I was so hungry.  Needless to say that didn't work to well, so after a slice and a half, my large pizza was thrown in the trash :(.  I chalked that experience up to a misfortune and realized that if I ever try to order pizza there again, check it before walking out.  No big deal.

Last night, I was in the mood for Italian take out.  I was craving penne ala vodka and mozzarella sticks.  Let's just say the mozzarella sticks were the best things my husband and I ordered.  I got my penne ala vodka and he got the baked ziti with garlic bread on the side.  My penne pasta was cooked well but the sauce was pink like it should be but...weird.  There were chunks of tomato, onion, and ham in the sauce, which is fine, but the sauce was not flattering whatsoever.  The vodka was definitely not cooked enough, leaving a bad vodka taste.  The viscosity of the sauce was also very thin.  I highly do NOT recommend this dish.  The baked ziti, was just that, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and ricotta.  There were loads of diced tomatoes and onion in there as well.  We didn't mind the veggies in the ziti but they were raw when they were thrown in the dish, when they should've been sauteed or carmelized.  The garlic bread that was served with our dishes, was less than to be desired.  You could tell it had at once actually been a good roll that was sliced into quarters with butter and garlic, but the toasting of it made it taste like charcoal.  Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.  They were your average bar cheese sticks with marinara.

I'm sorry Home Plate, but because of these epic food failures, we will not be returning except for drinks (maybe)."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time the other day. The service was very fast and friendly. The waitress suggested we order a pizza or a calzone because they're supposed to be the best items on their menu, but I remembered their fettuccine being pretty good last time I went, so I ordered it again and it was delicious. The portion is also pretty big, so I had a good amount to take home this time and last. Donald was feeling a bit under the weather when we went, so he just got a bowl of cream of broccoli soup (my favorite). It was very flavorful and creamy; it definitely warmed him up a little. I'll be back to try one of their pizzas or a calzone next time."}
{"text":"Thanks Ashley and crew! Great service and a fun arcade for the kids including tickets for prizes. Pizza and wings were delicious! Love Home Plate!  Ashley thanks for your VIP treatment toward us and providing excellent service. ;)"}
{"text":"First of all they have the best bartenders in town. The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is so fun. Whenever we have guests in town we always take them to our local watering hole, Home Plate."}
{"text":"Just finished up a great meal at Home Plate. Awesome service from Ashley. Great hire Glenn. Love this place. Great food, Great service."}
{"text":"Cool little bar close to home. Usually just order to go but the one time I did go in it took the guy 15 mins to bring my drink, he was super sweet and have it to me for free so all is forgiven. Food was hot and ready quick. The pizza here is really good, I like the just cheese best."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  A real SPORTS BAR with great food and personal speaker boxes for your table!!!! My family loves this place. the food is always consistant and really good for \"bar food\", as they say. It is far from everyday bar food. The pizza and burgers are awesome! Right now they are running a 24/7 special on MGD and Miller light. WOW! My husband got 4 pints for $4 bucks!I started off with a bloody mary and the bartender made me an amazing drink! Later, I wanted a Corona and I was shocked when the server told me it was only $2. The service is always great! We love that they have the Big ten package for college ball on saturdays AND the NFL ticket on sundays! SWEET! Great place and highly reccomend it!!"}
{"text":"The best local \"hole in the wall\" bar! Although I can't eat most of the food on the menu, my friends love it! Lots of great memories made here with friends"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a wonderful stay at the nearby South Point and had the best experience.  The waitress treated us like family, made suggestions and strongly encouraged us to take our beverages in their handy to-go cups.  Home cooking at its best!  Thank you Home Plate!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times since they rebranded the old Screwballs bar as Home Plate. The new owner who used to own Home Plate on Blue Diamond Rd. has done a great job with the plate. Nicely remodeled and a great new menu. Food is very good as is the service."}
{"text":"The food was ok. My friends rave about it I thought it as ok. 
Lots of TVs.
Service was forgetful and that's why I'm giving 3 not 4 stars."}
{"text":"Would give them 0 stars if that were possible. Looking for a new bar in the area that we can frequent since the one we have been going to raised their prices. Called just to get some ideas on how much their drinks were and was told \"I don't know we're super busy\" with an attitude. Sorry you have to do your job and answer a question? Pretty disappointing since they're right down the street and their menu looks pretty good."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

First off, they're a sports bar mostly and they have SEVERAL televisions around the entire establishment with every kind of sporting event on.  I got to watch Preseason Football, Baseball and a Hockey game all at once.

Second, their smoke free dining section and bar is separated by a glass partition.  So, you can eat your food, in peace, with no musty smoke to ruin your appetite and still watch the televisions in the bar area.

Third, their food is AMAZING!  Probably the best pizza I have ever had in Las Vegas.

Fourth (and most important, in my opinion), their customer service is top notch.  The waitresses seem genuinely happy to help the customers with anything and the owner even went from table to table to ensure that guests were satisfied.

I've been looking for a Monday Night Football dive for a while to make our regular place and I think I finally have.  I'll definitely be back several times throughout the football and baseball seasons."}
{"text":"No good. 
I went with a friend because she heard the pizza was good. - it's alright.

The guy bar tending hated his life. And his job. He was making sure we knew that. 

It was SO DEAD. We were the only ones there, along with our sleeping bartender.

We won't be returning, go to stieners!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar to come to. Not only is the food awesome, but the staff is AMAZING. All of the servers and bartenders always remember me, and what I drink, but Shannon and James especially make me feel at home. It's like my own personal Cheers. No wonder they call this place \"Home\" Plate. I always feel at home when I'm there."}
{"text":"The comments below were my first review

I won't go back.  damn near ended up in an altercation tonight because someone in my party played a goofy song on the juke box.  Bartenders skipped it (which is OK) but they got shitty about it and so did some of the patrons (defending the bartenders).  The whole thing was bad.  I watched it from the side.  shitty bartenders with an attitude.  I liked them up until now.  I guess it only took a little bit for them to show themselves.  Totally uncalled for.  If you can't handle a little goofiness then you're in the wrong business in a late night bar.  Put that together with the last review and this place is a loser.  DO NOT go here.  I've been going to this place for years and WILL NOT go back.  I'll find somewhere else where customers are valued over gaming.  While most of the bartenders and servers are great, the atmosphere is getting worse and worse.  This was always \"my place\" but it isn't anymore.  don't go here.  Just sad that I've lost my \"go to\" place.

____________________


Like this place. I was a DIE-HARD Repete's customer and loved the food and service. The new establishment is good. The service has been great. Mary Anne and Alexis have been amazing. Love them. 

I spend a significant amount of time here. I love to work here. Pull my laptop out and put in some time. However, the owners girlfriend (the Bar Ambassador) is a bit much. She may be the one reason I wouldn't go back. I don't like to be touched and cornered into conversation. I like to go to this place because it's got a great atmosphere and is easy going. She makes it hard to enjoy. She is a cloud over the place. Otherwise, the staff is amazing and so friendly. I love them all

The food is still great."}
{"text":"Love going to this bar. They have everything including pool tables, kids games, golden tee, football, jukebox, non smoking eating area. The pizza at this this place is unbelievable and so are the burgers. Strongly recommend the meatball and sausage pizza! 

Bartenders are really good and personable. Nice people and good food. Gambling is alright there, never win a lot but get to play for a bit on a little money. 

Also they have a lot of TVA and also speaker boxes for watching any nfl game you want..."}
{"text":"$25 for a large pizza with 3 toppings on??? Really??? $30 including a tip too...n it wasn't even that great taste to die for I would rather have little Cesar's $5 pizza"}
{"text":"Home plate has great hamburgers especially the greek burger but their prices are a little high on most of their stuff expect to pay $25 + for 2 people.  The garlic knotts are also very good but I would pass on the jalapenio poppers next time not very good and deffinately not worth the money, the pizza is also pretty skimpy but tastes good."}
{"text":"I've been here once before, about a year ago for a going away get together.. They have a pool table, golden tee, & touch screen games. No complaints my first time :)

My second visit was last night/early this morning and my two friends & I were staarving! We came in & I don't remember them having more than one golden tee. There was two or three different versions of golden tee & the tv screens are 20 some inches big :O it looks awesome.. We wanted to play but we had to order some food first.

We shared the garlic knots & I ordered the philly cheesesteak. The garlic knots were freakin amazing, it came with marinara sauce but there was a good amount of thick garlic sauce that the knots already had on it :9 I think that by itself could make you full. The philly was really good too, lots of steak falling out of my hoagie & the fries were seasoned perfectly. The other two ordered pizzas for each of them & I didn't want to bother asking for a slice because I knew I wasn't going to finish my philly. We ended up getting tired & sleepy so we skipped out on the golden tee games & boxed up our food.

I know we're going to be back soon, Home Plate is a good bar with more than enough food for your appetite & plenty of games to hang out :) Oh! and the bartender said when the football season starts they're going to play all of the games, so just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious considering it's \"bar food\". But, late night staff service/food will make you wait at least 45 min (my past 2 visits), and tonight they didn't even put in my order when I called from the house. So waited for 45 min again. But my pizza is delicious!!"}
{"text":"As a \"regular\" of the previous business that was here, I cannot believe this is what is replacing it!  It seems like the old Screwballs crowd had kids and they let them come here!  The bartenders I have come in contact with are awful, no personality, can't remember drink orders and not friendly.  There is one that is the graveyard bartender during the week and he is AMAZING! He is also from the old establishment.  
First time we were in one of the bartenders friends spilled a drink into the seat cushion of the bench seats and walked away from it blaming others for it.  It took about 15 minutes after they were made aware of this happening to clean it up.  Food was ok, we figured it wouldn't be too different since they kept one of the two chefs(who I now hear is also leaving, he is a chef, not just a cook).  
I had been to the old Home Plate and loved it, mostly because people were friendly, said hi when you came in, remember what you drink from round to round and asked how you are doing.  Now it seems I need to be under 30 years old to get anyone's attention.  
We stopped in this past weekend on Saturday and was SHOCKED at how a passed out drunk gentleman was treated while sitting at the bar.
First of all, how did he get that drunk in your bar?  He was able to order food(it was ordered and arrived while we got there) but unable to stay awake when it came. The bartender had to shake him to wake him and only asked that he move over to a table away from the gaming. Cashed out his machine and gave him the money but wanted him to eat at a table. He was awake and eating with his eyes closed.  Then he wanted to put in money to play again, the bartender stopped him and asked him to leave.  Where is he going, into his vehicle?? Seriously?!?! It took the customers to get this to go the right way.  Our friend stopped him from getting into his vehicle, nicely of course, and was going to set up Uber on his dime to get this guy home.  A customer at the bar stood up and said \"I'm an Uber driver, I'll take him home\"  Whether that was true or not, I believe it was and the gentleman paid his bill and took the guy home.  No help was offered by the bar to call a cab or any kind of ride for this guy.  Just wanted to send I'm out.
There are plenty of other places to go and unfortunately, this is no longer one of mine. Will anxiously await what comes next in that spot..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas.  The dough is superb and the sauce is a perfect balance of flavor. In fact, their pizza is cravable. 
As far as ambiance goes, it's just your average Vegas neighborhood bar which is perfect on a late night after work-- grab a few affordable drinks and perfect pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and as much as the service is always awesome. I can't forgive them for what happened. 

It was a beautiful day so the boyfriend and I decided to take the motorcycles out. We decided to stop by Home Plate. The previous times I've had the breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast any time of the day. But we felt like pasta and decided on the spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. Boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. It was overly seasoned so we sent it back. The spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. But at that point I was hungry and just finished what I could. Plus we had plans for the ride and we didn't want to waste the day. 

Later that afternoon while riding near Boulder Highway I all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. I thought it was just me so I didn't think anything of it. But when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit. 

Our nice afternoon out on the bikes was cut short as we both raced back home. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I took the kids tonight for some dinner and they wanted to play with the arcade games. The waitress was so nice to them and even gave them extra tokens because she saw how polite and well behaved they were....it made their day!
We will be back when ever they want to go!"}
{"text":"We were new to the area, decided to check this place out and it rocks! Foods good and so is the service! Ashley was our server was super friendly and fun and made us feel welcome! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg we are super excited that home plate is back.  We used to go to the one on blue diamond just for the pizza and to hang with Shannon."}
{"text":"So I've been quiet until now, but it seems the employees want to post reviews that the place is great. Well, as someone that was there multiple times a week, it's gone down hill faster than Picabo Street. I literally can't believe how bad the overall atmosphere has diminished,  good luck with the food quality since Jojo is now leaving, it will be substandard at best."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner since we live in the area. Tried the cheesesteaks--delicious! My husband loved the BBQ cheesesteak. Our server Ashley was phenomenal. She was very friendly and attentive. 

We tried the pizza last time we came in. The pizza was great-very cheesy! We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Everything is great........ Bar staff to owner come town feel a touch of class and clean environment !!!!!come on down and join our family where we me you feel at home!!!oh have to come try the bbq ribs they are so good today right off the grill and falling off the boneyummy"}
{"text":"We eat here a lot, in the smoke-free dining area. The waitresses are very friendly and helpful, and we never have to wait. The prices are good, not super cheap but certainly not unreasonable, and most of the salads and pasta are big enough to take some home for lunch tomorrow. The Greek salad with salmon is awesome, and my hubby loves the chicken parm. We try to go a bit later (7:30pm or later) because the room can get a bit noisy if there are lot of kids playing in the arcade area. Look in the coupon packs you get in the mail for discount promos, and they give you free garlic knots if you check in on facebook or yelp. And the zeppoles are yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been to Home Plate's both locations. I love their new location. I was at their one year anniversary. They had a DJ, magicians, free food. Home Plate has always been a great place to hang out and have a drink and have great food for locals. It's also a great place for locals to bring their family and friends when they're in town. It is an affordable, great bar with a great ambience and an excellent staff and a cool owner."}
{"text":"Just a quick review on this place -- I ordered some food yesterday for my office team and I called in to place an order. The person I spoke with, I believe her name is Shannon, was not pleasant on the phone at all, she was kind of rude, in fact. She also coughed really gnarly right into the phone and didn't even say excuse me... how gross. I can just imagine her coughing her way through the kitchen as she packed up my food. 

When I came to pick up, I stood at the bar for a good 10 minutes all while she ignored me. I just watched her walk back and forth about 4 times and it seemed like she deliberately did not want to lift her head up to look at me, until I waved and gave her a \"WTF\" look. She said \"Your stuff is over there.\" I'm like... \"WHERE dude? Where over there?\" ..\"Other side of the bar\". No greeting, no smile, nothing. Just pointing to the other end of the bar. 
Ok.... so I walk to the other side and she hands me my check back without any eye contact. 
I understand that it was early, on a week day, but I did not feel welcome or taken care of by this person. 

The food: This part was awesome and delicious. Everyone enjoyed the goodies and we had an awesome lunch together right before a loong weekend. I'll order again, because the quality was definitely awesome, but my first impression of the employee was at a zero."}
{"text":"The home plate is amazing. I was sad to see the old location go away, however shortly after they open their new location. Same great food and entertainment and always the best service especially Shannon. She is awesome and makes you feel so welcome"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and I have always had good service. The food is great. I came in the other night and Ashley was so awesome and so nice and personable. All the servers are awesome. It is always clean in the restaurant and the food is always fresh.  Even when it is busy the service is aces. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"One positive, the bartender was on top of it. That is where the positive experience ends. My group was here in the restaurant to eat some food and not watch the fight, thus got a table away from all the TVs. They still charged a $10 cover even though there was maybe 10 minutes left in the fight when arrived and no clear view of the TV. $7.50 pitchers we found were $14 after the pour. Could not get a waitress to serve us food. The lady who collected the $10 had a smart and vindictive response to everything. Bathrooms smell horrible. Maybe the worst experience on Blue Diamond? Maybe this place has a better and friendlier wait staff at non peak times? Would not recommend to anyone who wants a cheap drink and good atmosphere.

@Glen - Take things personal much? How about not mocking customers and be situational with it? If one person asked if there was a problem at the time, that would go a long way towards displaying good customer service. Just saying."}
{"text":"I came to Home Plate hearing that the pizza rivaled Bootlegger's pizza... It was better! The bar staff was friendly especially Josh who is a transplant from Repete's, I guess. He was very attentive and friendly... The decor was very clean and welcoming... I want that picture of the UNLV championship ring in the corner!! Other than the pizza I've tried a few other things on the menu that were amazing... The chicken under the brick, and the beef tips stood out also! Everyone there seemed to enjoy themselves... I drink beer and a shot, but I felt before my beer was empty I was being asked if I wanted a refill which is huge to me because I've sat in bars where I've had an empty beer while the bartender is standing in the corner trying to pick up on chicks... I highly recommend Home Plate and will be back time and time again!!"}
{"text":"Homeplate is the quintessential neighborhood bar for the Southern Highlands/Mountains Edge area on Blue Diamond... All the bartenders know who you are and remember you... Joe is my regular because he is what a graveyard bartender is all about...If you come in with someone he attends to you while also giving you some breathing room... He always has a great attitude and is cracking jokes all night long... The food is really good. I have my favs off the menu whether it's breakfast or a burger or a wrap... Plus you can't beat the graveyard FREE pizza buffet... There's a reason why whichever direction I drive in from I usually will drive past 2-3 other bars to come to Homeplate..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, lots of tv's and great service! And you have the chance of catching a lobster for $2. They have a machine similar to those where you try to grab a stuffed animal with a machine claw. I got lucky and caught one on my first try! You catch it they cook it!! Had a lot of fun here will definitely return!

Edit to original review 3/18/15
Lobster tank is gone.... Service after 11pm is not that great"}
{"text":"I can't believe Home Plate has closed. I have been going there for years! Great burgers, strong drinks and really a local hangout. It saddens me every time I drive by now and the sign is taken down. I guess this review serves nothing other than me saying goodbye. :("}
{"text":"I've never seen a worse bartender in my life. Came in after work a couple of weeks ago, and Dan was the bartender. Everytime I asked for anything (a drink, a menu, water) he acted completely rude and as if I was a burden. Too busy drinking and chatting with his friends. Every single time I told him thank you, he just walked away. Not once did he say your welcome. Then I watched him laugh at someone because they couldn't open the front door and call them stupid. I'm a bartender myself, and to me, service is everything. Dan has absolutely no manners, which turned me off from this place for good."}
{"text":"Tried to have dinner here with the family so we went into what would be considered the family dining area since we obviously couldn't go into the bar section with our kids.  Sat down were there for at least a solid 10 minutes and not a single server came our way.  There weren't any signs posted stating that we should flag someone in the bar or place an order at the bar so not sure what the deal was there.  We ended up leaving and going elsewhere since it didn't look like we were going to be greeted any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is going to be my favorite place for Sunday football.  Great  pizza and beer how could a girl go wrong.  They have this booth  with its own tv.    And they changed it to my favorite team Chargers. That's great customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing. Kasey and Shannon, by far the best bartenders i've come across in years. Exceptional service and attentiveness. Refills and identifying needs . Terrific jukebox, amazing pizza, no reason to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service is questionable. Some days it is spot-on, others will make you wonder if you're invisible. However, we enjoy the food so much that we accept the fact that you can't come in here to eat and be in a hurry. Sunday mornings there is usually only one server for the entire dining room, so get there before the church rush! The breakfasts are really good (my fave is the ham steak) and surprisingly cheap."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back. They would have gotten 3 stars if the service wasn't so terrible. They would have gotten 2 stars if they hadn't accidentally charged us double. The food is mediocre at best. We had the garlic knots, cheese bread, thick crust pepperoni pizza, and zippolis for dessert. The knots are deep fried and tasteless. The cheese bread was like Papa Johns but not as good. The pizza was a little bit like Dominos. The crust was better but way too much sauce with rosemary sprinkled all over it. The zippolis were good, tasted like powdered doughnuts. The drinks are overpriced with a bad selection. 
The service was beyond terrible. Forgetting napkins, plates, silverware, drinks. Taking forever to get us these things after asking for them. Not checking back in. Asking for our check then waiting 20 minutes only to have our check screwed up. 
The atmosphere is pretty weird. Went in to watch a baseball game but no games were on the tv. Really loud old rock/country playing. About 4 regulars playing video poker in the bar but the dining room was pretty busy with families. Tried using the sound box to listen to the game but there was too much static. There is a big plexiglass window separating the bar from the dining room, so you feel like you are on display or in a zoo."}
{"text":"Regular pie! Nothing special, I was expecting something a little more tasty and cheesy; There was a lot of dough"}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not.

So I used to frequent this place 3 years ago during football season.  I guess watching the games at the bar and having breakfast in the summer are completely different.

This morning was a disaster.  Firstly, there were half the tables that I remember in their smoke free dining room (extra star for this), but they were replaced by a junky buffet and lots of arcade machines. It is very family friendly (never a good combination for a successful Sports \"BAR\")

The food though, was not good at all.  I spent $27 on an inedible mess. 

Steak and eggs review: Kale, really? Kale?  So 1990s.  Salt and pepper is your friend!  The hash browns were cooked only one side and as I just said, under seasoned.  The steak (ordered medium rare) came out black and blue. The steak was cold and raw on the inside and burnt to hell on the outside. Too much oil on the steak before putting it on the grill caused it to flame up and burn the oil, rookie mistake.  The eggs (ordered over easy) were over medium (borderline over well), hard to mix with the hash browns.  Two thumbs down

Something about a \"favorite\" omelet review:  Obviously, I cannot remember the name of this dish. It was highlighted by outlining it on the menu; however, should really be avoided.   This was a tomato omelet topped with the signature chili verde.  Yuck, bad, cough, puke if you will.   The dog food on top of the omelet was horrible.  I scraped it off after my first bite.  The meat in the chili verde tasted like canned steamed stew meat.  It had no texture, sear or caramelization.    The omelet could not be eaten as it was cooked again at too high a heat and the egg scorched and after two bites; I thought the tomatoes in the omelet were old and spoiled.  By old I mean that yesterday's product was mixed with anything chopped today (that is my benefit of a doubt) for the cook who was there, but they were not tasty by any means.  The hash browns were the same as on our steak and eggs, under seasoned and not very crispy.  I didn't eat much of the meal at all.  Anything in addition to my thumbs that can be turned down, IS!

Service:  it was barely considered OK, the waitress was nice, but we were the only (did I say only?) table in the dining room for over 35 minutes.  She was not knowledgeable about the menu or what she needed to do.  She told us that she \"doesn't usually work breakfast\".  Why does that concern the guest?  I overheard the cook ask her if he \"needed to show her how to work the toaster?\" Based on his previous cooking display, working the toaster may be too much for him too!
I will not be back to dine here again."}
{"text":"As a local it's important to have great local bars! Not only is the food great but the service is amazing! Shannon, Rhonda, Joe, Casey, Mikki, Josh, all call this place home they remember you each time you walk in and you feel right at home! It's a great place to grab a drink and watch the game or have dinner!"}
{"text":"First off, I had a blast cause I was able to spend some quality time with my mom and son, which a rare lately  due to my crazy work schedule, with that said I was very very very disappointed in the customer service or just service in general.  The place is very cute and cool, tons of tv's with tons of sports to watch.  Nice and cool inside, and there wasn't many people when we went.  Our server was not good at all.  Kept forgetting about us.  Forgetting to bring us things, small or big, she couldn't get it together.  Now, just because I myself am a server and work in a restaurant doesn't mean I'm picking on her.  She herself said to me 'am I ignoring you guys alot tonight?' ummmmmmmmm yeah!!!!!!!!! 

The little game area was ok, although the machines kept taking my money and I  had to keep getting someone to fix it.  Annoying!  

Food was ok too.  Loved the house salad.  My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin.  We had to ask three times for more dressing.  My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else.  Ten minutes later, still no beer.  I finally had to get up fine the server and ask her to get the beer........now!

We had fun just being together and watching the game and my son play.  But, I wont be going back anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since the new ownership. The service is hit and miss (I've walked out after not even having my drink order taken after 10 minutes of sitting there).

They are known for their pizzas and burgers. The pizzas have a funny grit on them that gets a sand texture in your mouth about every third bite. The 'amazing flame grilled burgers' are tasteless. I can get a better burger at 5 Guys (which is only half a block East).

The bar area is way too smoky and the drinks are weak. 

There are so many better options in this town, save yourself the time and skip over this place."}
{"text":"Above average \"bar food\".  

Kitchen times are pretty quick.  Staff was always near if we needed anything.  

Kids like the games.  Gave them a little diversion while waiting on the food. Waitress was good. Even gave the kids some free tokens to play.

Will be adding to the short list of places to have a decent bite to eat while not fretting over the kids."}
{"text":"I dropped by Home Plate in search of a hearty brunch before my drive back to Orange County. They had a list of brunch specials, all under $8 and in plentiful portions, as well as the rest of the menu, which included traditional breakfast fare, pastas, sandwiches, and pizza.

I ended up ordering something totally strange (chicken alfredo), and the waitress gave me a face that indicated as much. I should have followed her expression, because the alfredo sauce ended up being rather bland. The chicken was also cooked interestingly - it seems like it might have been poached? There were no cook marks so it was hard to tell. Still, the meal satisfied what I was craving - I had undereaten the night before AND overdrank, so I wanted carby goodness. I also can't blame anyone for my weirdly ordering chicken alfredo at 10 AM, you know?

With all that said, I'll be honest, I love the vibe here. I love the bar separate from the dining area, which means you can dine without all that cigarette smoke. I loved the waitress, who was so very kind - treated me like I was a regular, lots of good-natured vibing. I wish I had caught her name; I only remember that she was a bit older. I'd return just for her.

Oh, and the fact that this place is off-strip and in fact on the way out of town? Perfect. The driving was easy, the parking easier, and the prices exactly what they needed to be. After being ripped off at dinner on the strip the night before, Home Plate let me round out my vacation without breaking the bank even more."}
{"text":"Great Pizza Great Price...Monday thru Friday the a All you can eat buffet for $6.99....the buffet has 3 different pastas several choices of pizza and some dessert a amazing salad bar with all the fixins....Bar atmosphere great for the guys to watch all kinds of sports...Games for the Kids..

I will return again my picky 13 year olds favorite place 

Great Service"}
{"text":"I live literally two blocks from this place and have heard rave reviews from my boyfriends brother.  So we decided to give it a try.  We got mixed results.  However, it was never great.  We get take-out a lot.  The wings are small and soggy, not crispy.  The pizza is decent but has a weird almost cookie-like textured crust, which is not to my liking.  The sauce is weird too.  I remembered I ordered a chicken breast Philly cheese steak sandwich one time and by the time I got it home, I realize it was a half a roll with two dried up pieces of chicken, some onions and peppers, and no cheese.  I usually don't get upset but I was pissed.  There wasn't a lot of fries with my order either.  $9 for a piece of stale bread and dried up meat.  We don't order from there any more.  Rounders on Blue Diamond is a little further from us but well worth the drive.  

Home Plate is a fun little bar with lots of games and great atmosphere and a fun menu.  It gets really smoky, however, and the menu doesn't seem to deliver.  Everything looks good but disappoints in the end."}
{"text":"Most definitely a great bar and restaurant!  The food was surprisingly much better than I'm used to going to bars.  Not my typical spot for eating, but coming here the last few times, I really enjoyed all my dining in each and every time.  Hands down one of my favorite bars in vegas.  I like the jukebox and foosball, along with the video poker and some of the specials that they have.  Most especially I really appreciated our bartender/host Dan the man!  Suggesting and doing a bit extra always stands out to me.  As to pouring drinks the right way for that specific and proper taste to your beer.  To just being an overall pal.  I like the crowd here.  And I can only say that because of him the vibe for me at Home plate was on point!  I'm definitely going to continue being a regular. If you're around, or just wanting to find a chill spot, Come on down!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars to come to if not my absolute favorite.  Whenever I have visitors from out of town I bring them here so the feel the same warm welcome I receive every time I come in.  The best part is that no matter when I come every bartender has made the effort to remember me and it really is a great feeling.  My usual day to go in is Sunday.  Sunday mornings with Shannon make my upcoming work week so much more bearable.  She knows exactly what I drink and usually has it waiting for me. Shannon will ensure your food is right every single time.  And if it's not it's fixed immediately and usually without you even asking.  Going the extra mile even when they don't really have to.  The food is amazing to me.  I'm super picky and a big substituter. I annoy myself.  They actually will honor my picky requests and not even bat an eye.  The meatballs here are to die for.  So much so that I order them on their own as my meal.  Visit and you will be hooked!!"}
{"text":"My review shouldn't count... I walked in around 6am wanting breakfast before work. What I found was the party crowd from last night still going. Music, shots, beer and music going full on. A party of 9 still kept it going as the window shades closed to cover the sunrise. 

I ordered the chicken fingers buffalo style with bleu cheese. They arrived hot and with an extra side of dressing. The chicken was crispy but had a tender taste with great flavor."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing local bar. This is the place to be at. The bartenders are A MAZING  and they play good music which is a definite plus in my book. It's close to the strip as well. They have awesome pizza and great bar food there as well. They have TV's everywhere which is perfect . I love to watch football there. A perfect local bar"}
{"text":"Dude u guys have got to stop cooking the wings to the point of being JERKY!!  The wings are bad. You can't be so worried about undercooking them that you creamate them. I like the place and the sports and my kids love it. The waitresses are typically good with them. 

But the food has a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend before heading home to Phx. The pizza was really good. My friend had a breakfast burrito and she really liked it. We were confused when we came in because there's no sign that tells you if you should seat yourself and no one was readily available. Most of this place is a bar for only over 21 and we had kids with us so we obviously ate on the restaurant side which was small, maybe 10 tables but that was plenty as most everyone was in the bar and only 3 families in the restaurant portion. They seemed understaffed so that's why we weren't helped at first and didn't know where to sit or if we should just wait or what (a sign would be nice), but ultimately we got it figured out and once the waitress had time to help us she was friendly and kind. I'd go back, especially now that I know where to sit. LOL"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood tavern. Just check in on yelp and you get free garlic knots woot!  They are pretty good, chewy and covered in fresh garlic. Yum. 

Also had the garlic cheese pizza with a side of marinara and that was the best $5 I ever spent. A little much on the garlic side but it was still very good and I was really hungry. The staff is friendly and the place itself feels very inviting. Would like to come back for some nachos next time."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. Friendly staff. Amber is awsome. Divided bar & restaurant and no smoke in the restaurant.  Good food and drinks with tvs all over and games for the kids. Whenever sports are on,  they have some fun stuff going on and have a great crowd."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a looong time. Great for just hanging out with friends in the bar area, or even coming with family, hanging out and playing games in the restaurant area.  Aside from the pizza, wings, chili cheese fries (green chili, mmmmm) and apps are awesome.  My official go to place now."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome and the food great. Terrific vibe! We got served right away. We loved the garlic knots. Its also a great place to catch a game, lots of tv's."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place simply because of the bartenders. My friend happens to know one of them fairly well, but looking around, it seems that they treat all of their patrons with the same generosity.

A couple of weekends ago, I watched some Sunday morning NFL here with said friend. I ordered the 2-2-2, which is your basic 2 eggs, 2 bacon/sausage, 2 pancake deal. They accidentally brought out the wrong plate, but it looked similar enough, so I just started eating it. When they realized the mistake, they brought out the right plate in addition. So basically, I was sitting there staring at way too much bacon and eggs. Needless to say, I didn't eat it all, but this is just a small example of how awesome the bartenders are. Also, when my check came out, it was less than the price listed in the menu. And I wasn't charged for my drink.

The only downside for me is that it's actually a little difficult to watch games on their screens. They have plenty of them, but they are in a variety of places that aren't always easy to see. Other than that, I definitely need to come here more often."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Not only is the food amazing, but the staff at home plate are the nicest people around. Shannon always makes you feel right a home and this evening we met James who was just as courteous. Shannon has made us feel at home since day one and we have never had better service. To the man that left the review about the match play, it isn't her fault that you don't know how it works. I was sitting next to you during the entire conversation and I feel you are exaggerating the entire issue. In order to get match play you have to put in 20.00 sorry that is how it works, you don't get match play on winnings and I believe she was just explaining that to you. You can't complain about the service just because you were unaware of how it works."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to order some breakfast- kind of weird because I didn't think that there was a bar/restaurant that would be open 24/7. 
When I walked in there were arcade games to my right- which I thought was kind of nice. Being able to bring the kids while having something to eat or a drink or two at the bar. 
When we sat down it took the waitress a while to give us the menu and serve us our drinks since she was the only server there. 
We ordered our food but ended up waiting for at least a half hour- not too bad since she was the only waitress. 

I ordered the Souvlaki breakfast while my friend ordered the three egg breakfast. 
I'm not sure if it was the cook or the food that I ordered but the chicken was not appetizing at all and had so much seasoning that I couldn't even taste the chicken. I ended up substituting the chicken for a ham steak (which came out pretty quickly). All in all the waitress was nice and the people were friendly. The food was okay but I wouldn't mind giving this place another try. 

Maybe don't order the Souvlaki breakfast next time :)"}
{"text":"This place is really cool! I've been coming here for years. You have the option of eating in the dining room or the bar. If you eat in the dining room, you will be treated to walls covered in an assortment of baseball memorabilia and decorations. Pretty cool if you're a fan of America's pastime. If you eat in the bar, they have SEVERAL televisions to catch your favorite game. I mean, seriously, they can get ANY game. You won't be disappointed. I've had at least three different entrees from their menu, and I have yet to be disappointed. I personally recommend their chicken wings. YUM! Also, service is great and overall it's not too pricey. If you like sports and good food, I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Okay will change the review... will give her 5 stars... it's good to know that they actually do read the reviews!
We started over with a fresh slate.
 Service was great ..even though the machine was still kind of cold to me.. the bartender tried to explain her position again from last time .. I guess I see her point.. but she did come off kind of abrasive before.
 She was a nice person this time.. which is what I expect when I'm getting customer service especially when I haven't been to a place in a long time.

I guess I just have to keep trying to see if their Keno machines will actually pay someday!!"}
{"text":"entire menu is great.  Homemade French fries addicting."}
{"text":"Their fries are great burgers were good and beer selection was a little on the lame side overall a good place to eat just not a great beer bar.

Beer Na not their own beer
Food 8/10
Ambiance 7.5/10"}
{"text":"Solid bar food!  We stopped in for lunch and had the chicken quesadillas, loaded nachos and chili verde burritos and everything was excellent.  Reasonable prices and huge portions."}
{"text":"What a joke. Went in and was having a great time until the bartender, Joe, decided to get so belligerently drunk that he was insulting my friends and I. When I asked for my tab he told us just to leave. One of my friends tried asking him if he was actually serious (we had been joking most of the night) and he said \"yes, just get the fuck out\". If I owned this bar, I would question the sober ness of my bartenders and how they treated guests. This alcoholic took a 180 and I will never be back. This bar is close to my house and several friends go there, it's just sad this bartender couldn't handle his own drinks while working and made the entire bar uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My second time coming in and I will definitely be back . The first time I came with my Dad and the food was fantastic (breakfast), it made me drive across town again this time with my mom and grandmother. Today the food was just ok , but the one thing that is totally consistent is the service provided by Zo!!! He's amazing , very attentive and informative about the things the bar has going on but not pushy . His service and kindness made up for the not so great breakfast. To be fair the breakfast was not bad , just not as great as the first time! Will definitely try again and would recommend this place to any locals looking to try a new place. The ambience is fantastic , feels more like a little country restaurant than a bar!"}
{"text":"Well I was finally able to visit the new location. 
I have to be honest here, I really enjoyed the old location very much. I went to the new location I guess expecting something similar, boy was I let down. 

Now In fairness the food was every bit as good as it was. But the place is far from the family friendly place it was. The place is first and for most a bar, with a small area sectioned off for dining. 
The tables are small and the look is very sterile. Not warm at all. No games for the kids and to be honest I  would not bring my grand daughter here. 

It's suppose to be smoke free in this area but they leave the door to the connecting hallway open so the room is full of smoke. The staff was very friendly, but slow on recognizing when you come into the restaurant portion. The bar area was a lot bigger and had some nice decorations much like the old location. 

I know for myself I won't be back and it's a shame I really liked the place before."}
{"text":"This place has the best garlic parmesan wings in town! I've been here on a number of occasions and the majority of my visits happen to be when I'm 100% sober, so my palate isn't being biased. They're perfectly crisp topped with fresh garlic and parmesan (none of that pasty stuff like BWW or Hooters) and fairly priced knowing you're getting your money's worth with every wing or leg. Never tried anything else from the menu but from what I've heard, it's pretty good for bar food. As far as garlic parmesan wings goes, this place does not disappoint! If it does, call me over and I'll finish them for you."}
{"text":"Dan is our go to guy every time we visit. Very accommodating! Dan is the man. Love the beard."}
{"text":"Sat bar side tonight and Stephen was the bartender.  He was very professional, friendly, attentive and was honest.  Said he can't lose any weight cause the pizzas was so good and Good thing I don't live in Vegas cause I wouldn't lose weight either.  The pizza was delicious.  I ordered the Pepperoni and it seasoned nicely and there parmesan cheese was fresh too.  Great place will be back again while I'm in town."}
{"text":"It's definitely a restaurant for the locals.  We walked in and they had two doors once you step in.  One seemed to be the bar and the other was the seating area.  No one was at the front so we sat ourselves.  Minutes after the waitress came in and gave us the menus. We asked for water, she only brought us 2 waters and nothing for my toddler son.  She checked in on us, but it wasn't great service. The smoking smell is very penetrated from the bar area and in goes into the dining area.  I couldn't wait to be out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great selection of food. I had trouble deciding. The sausage and meatball pizza was really good. I'm looking forward to coming back to try the chili verde burger."}
{"text":"Great local place off the strip, amazing garlic knots, pizza, affordable drinks..happy hour is 11pm-3am with all these $5 sober you up food;) I am a regular here now.."}
{"text":"First time at this bar. I like the location right off Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs.  They have a great beer selection, plenty of gaming machines and a lot of tvs for the sports fan in you.  We decided to have dinner here and we were very happy with the food.   The bartender and food servers were very pleasant and quick with our orders."}
{"text":"This is the old Repeats location. The food is typical bar fare. The ambiance and atmosphere both have changed but not for the better. I miss the old guy that owned Repeats!"}
{"text":"So I stopped in late night last night because I really couldn't sleep after laying my head down.  Machines played a little tight at first but then I left even.

Nice open floor plan in bar.  The TV's are huge!  Really nice picture with a very good sound system.  This would be a really great place to watch any game you wanted to come out and see.

The menu is pretty extensive.  They have a restaurant separated from the bar.  So no need to worry about smoke while you are eating.  Menu had everything from Pizza to a pretty large appetizer menu that they promote for Happy Hour.  I went with the garlic knots and they were pretty good.  Nice and hot and just enough garlic.

You can't miss them just west of Las Vegas boulevard on Warm Springs!  Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"So glad they reopened not so far away!  Always loved this place.  Great food, great people.  Mary Ann was our server and she was great.  Our food (Shrimp Scampi) was fabulous!   Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look kid friendly from outside, but they have a family room that keeps you out of the bar. But be prepared to still smell smoke from the bar area. The food was good and had generous portions, but service is a little slow."}
{"text":"Thanks Home Plate especially to Kasey.  Enjoyed the food and service.  The taco salad was delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"The menu is more than just bar food (although that would be enough for me!). And it's really good food, but the difference was our waitress. She was awesome! Also, my daughter loved the arcade. This is the ideal Bar and Grill: good food, great service, and lots of fun! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to update this review. GLEN the owner called me upon request after my last review and showed he really cared about me, one of the many people who have eaten there. I was super impressed with the fact he seems to want to fix the problem. Thank you glen. Also speaking with the kitchen manager was awesome to. The food is amazing and I will of course be back."}
{"text":"We used to eat here several times per week. Due to dietary restrictions we now eat at home mostly. Last night I brought my husband here for a treat. He loves the chicken parm. He's Italian and claims it's among the best he's ever eaten.  I always get the souvlaki. It tastes like a back east Greek diner. The food was great and the service is always fantastic. I highly recommend Home Plate for a local, close to home dinner. The only negative is I think it's a tad pricy for a locals place. Thus, the 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the kind of bar that alcoholics go to. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that, I just don't typically like to end my night by spilling beers in my lap like I saw some patrons doing here. There's always nice cars parked in the lot, but I don't know who's driving them.

The food is pretty gnarly, but I mean, it's bar food. It was really salty.

If you want drinks with any haste, I'd recommend going to the bar to order them. We sat in a booth and the bartender was making a point to ignore and otherwise tick off our waiter.

It's a small place, and one in a million crappy sports bars in Vegas.

Also, they were inexplicably playing \"Dancer in the Dark\" on three of their TVs. WTF? That's like one of the saddest movies of all time. It stars Bjork. Really? At a sports bar?"}
{"text":"Jessie Lee is the \"Bomb Diggity!!\" Single and Sexy!! 
The food is old school bar food done right. Try the Calzone. -outta this world."}
{"text":"Had a date night with the hubby, decided to stop by home plate since it was close to the house, environment was nice! sat down at a table since we didn't want to sit at the bar (wasn't busy at all) waited, waited, waited some more, not one hello not one person stopped by. After 15 min of being ignored we decided to leave. Safe to say we won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great spot to hangout late night... Had the bbq pizza and every bite took me to a magical place i had never been to before.  The drinks were cold and the service was prompt. The jukebox is rich with variety and there are options on top of options on top of options to choose from."}
{"text":"First time here! Great service and food! Ashley was absolutely amazing, we can't wait to come back!!! :)"}
{"text":"The food was good as I remembered from Blue Diamond location. The wait staff isn't the friendliest though. I have come here 2x since they moved and both servers were blah.  I will probably be back because of the food. I am not sure though."}
{"text":"There's a whole world of food options in Vegas and once you've visited a few times and gotten past the celebrity restaurants on the Strip, that's where the real options begin.  Home Plate is one of these options, way off the Strip and where the locals eat.  I know because a local took me here and described it as one of her favorite places.

It's a great combination of sports bar and 24 hour restaurant, with slots and video poker, because it is Vegas after all. The menu is super-expansive with a variety of appetizers, burgers, wings, pizza, sandwiches, and breakfast.

As for the food, VERY good.  I had the Jack Daniels chicken wings which had a sweet taste with a slight bite.  The cheese pizza was also cooked to perfection.  My friend had the bacon cheeseburger which she raved about.  The burger was also as big as I've seen a burger in quite a while and the toppings were obviously high quality.

Do yourself a favor if you need to eat in Vegas -- avoid the hassle of the Strip and eat a better meal for less money...."}
{"text":"Wow was pleasantly suprised at this placed. My friend and I went in here on a whim since it was  right across from the store we were in and the fact that this is place is close to our houses. I got a burger and fries and I was suprised it was really good. I did not try anything else, however I do intend to go back.  Its my local spot."}
{"text":"This review is specific to tonight's visit.  We have been coming here for years, off and on.  The food changes, with their different cooks.  Whomever was the cook tonight makes me not want to come back EVER!!

We check in for the free garlic knots.  Waitress was really quick and attentive.  In fact, she saw me on my phone and while she grabbed our drink order - she put in the garlic knots.  Our drinks never went dry.  She was awesome!  I even left her a cute note on the credit card receipt.

The hubby ordered his meatball sandwich with French fries overflowing the plate.  Awesome!!  I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  It comes with two pieces of garlic toast.  I started eating the toast with the Alfredo sauce...  Eating the pasta...  And after about 1/3 of the noodles are eaten, I move over to eat a piece of chicken that was mixed in with the pasta.  At first I thought it was a piece of garlic.  Nope!  It was an odd tasting piece of chicken.  Unsure but sure about the chicken, I decided to eat a piece of the chicken that was sliced on he side.  It was tough, smelled sour, and has a slimy taste.  I was done.

The waitress brought back the pasta and said that maybe the cook put lemon on it or didn't season it.  The cook had a piece and said it tasted very chicken.  What is that supposed to mean?!

I spent 1 hour praying to the porcelain gods that my stomach cramps, shakes and exploding rear end would stop.  

Will we be back?  Maybe in a few months.  Maybe in a year.  I dunno.  This might have sealed the deal on ever coming back!"}

Ok, this is my favorite hangover stop and that is my excuse for not having more check ins here; I know I've been at least 8-10 times but only have one check in? will have to try harder to remember but its tough sometimes. Whenever I wake up early and want a good breakfast without a crazy crowd I come here; great wait staff and cooks; My Girlfriend liked the Bloody Mary here and we both had a blast playing ski ball and video games the last time we were there. We must have had a couple hundred tickets collected and we handed them to a little girl and her father to redeem for prizes and made her day. 

They have old bay spiced shrimp! One of only a few places in town that serve them seasoned this way and it says me a drive down to Crab Corner; I haven't had a bad meal here and have tried both breakfast and lunch.

I'm a huge Baseball fan so walking in and seeing the baseball memorabilia everywhere is awesome and I'm glad to know this place exists; I will be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"RUDE waitress. she didn't listen, didn't get the order right but i bet if i was a guy alone she would have paid attention.  NOISY NOISY and cold. not a pleasant environment for dinner.
the wings were like jerky, just as dry and tough.  but the pizza was good.  not enough for me to want to actually eat there again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed how friendly and open the bartender was. Everyone was so chill and fun. The drinks were on point as well"}
{"text":"I love taking my whole family to Home Plate Grill & Bar.  We have been coming here since we first moved to the SW side of town in 2010.  The atmosphere in the dining room is family friendly with arcade games that my kids love and the food is great!  In fact, they have one of the best NY style pizzas in town.  Their wings are also another favorite.  Plus, this is the only place in town where I can watch a football game with my kids!  BONUS!

My hubby also likes to come with friends after work.  All the waitstaff is friendly, and  again, the food is delicious at a great price!  WINNING!"}
