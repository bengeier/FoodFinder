{"text":"I wanted to update because I've been back several times. Wonderful environment (playlist is always great!), awesome cocktails and bartenders, and all the food I've tried has been great. Nice place to come for a drinks and an appetizer or a flatbread."}
{"text":"I'd never been to the old Amy's, but we decided to stop by to Mezze on the strength of a recommendation. Really enjoyed the food--unique Levantine-style flavors without being fussy-pretentious. The kale-mushroom pizza was fantastic, and surprisingly filling split two ways. The fava bean and chicken kabob small plates were also very good. The only weird thing was the way the entrance is set up--we thought we'd accidentally come in the back door. Five thumbs up for the playlist!"}
{"text":"Mezze might just be my favorite restaurant in the immediate downtown area. It's always the first place I suggest when a friend wants to grab a bite--and not just because it's right down the street (don't hurt though ). The unique tapas-style cuisine and cozy, almost sultry ambience keep me coming back way too often for my own good (both physically and fiscally).   Mezze features a small menu of small(ish) plates tending toward Mediterranean/American/??? flavors. They change their menu every couple of months but I am never disappointed--it is always filled with mixtures of flavors that I have never experienced before (but want to experience again and again!). Some of my favorites over the span of its existence include:  Fried Chicken Hummus w/ Lamb Acorn squash w/ wild rice, cranberries, feta & maple glaze This empanada-type thingy with squash & raisins, served with a homemade pesto (name??) THE GOAT CHEESE PIZZA--whichever one there is at the time (I've now had two versions and they both were some of the best pizza I've ever had--tastes even better as leftovers straight from the fridge because you can really taste all them flavors when it's cold )   We always order a bunch of plates to share because I'm tryna taste everything I can. Menu names are a little tricky but the usual waiter/bartender (owner?) is always happy to explain what they mean. DO NOT MISS THE PIZZA. It's at the bottom of the menu and it's not called \"pizza,\" but pizza it is.   Cocktails are pretty small but that doesn't stop me from ordering them...the dark and cozy feel of the place just begs to be paired with a cocktail (or 2 or 3). They also usually have drink specials depending on the day and time (often it's half-off wine, which works just fineeeeeeee).  The space is pretty small, so if you're planning to go out with a big group I'd vote a few people off the island OR plan to go to Mezze another time (but, like, go.). It's perfect for groups of 2 or 4...or 1, I guess, but I like to be optimistic ;). When it's warm out, they also have a nice area for outdoor seating.  I don't agree with the haters on here when it comes to Mezze's downfalls, but I can see how some may have qualms. The menu is full of really different flavors and strange combinations..so if you're not into that, it might not be your jam! If you don't like sharing, it's for sure not your jam. If you're looking for a quick in-and-out job......depends? The service is usually great--the main guy who works there (owns the place?) is usually the one serving and bartending and he's really nice and attentive! We did have a female waiter one time who was a little forgetful and less attentive (I think she was also drinking behind the bar--oops), but she was still nice enough."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try Mezze for a while and finally found myself there last Friday. Between the two of us, we ordered hummus with lamb, carrot salad, a stuffed mushroom pie called fatayer, and kefta. None of it was good.  Drinks were fine, but only until later did I realize they served pizza, with your options hidden on the drinks menu rather than along with the food.  The hummus was atrocious. Absolutely no flavor at all. Like chickpeas were unfrozen, thrown into a blender, refrozen, and tossed on a plate without any addition of oil, garlic, or tahini. The lamb on top of it was seasoned fine, but not warm.  The carrot salad had the right idea, but came out oily, not hot, and just kind of sat there after we tried a couple bites.  We ordered the kefta for a main, and I'm used to something strongly flavored. This was not. It was a lamb burger (lamb patty between two pieces of pita that fell apart when eating it like a burger). I even asked the waitress if somehow seasoning was missing, but she said it definitely was seasoned like it should be. Labeling that kefta on the menu is just wrong.  Lastly, the fatayer. The pie itself came out stone cold. This clearly was pre-made and reheated for service. The mushrooms were rubbery and slimy, as if they, too weren't made to order. It was disgusting. Probably one of the worst dishes I've ever had.  Perhaps the regular crew wasn't working that night, or other reviewers are just easier to please, but I haven't had a meal this disappointing in years. Even the waitress didn't try to stand up for what she was serving. After a couple bites of each dish, we asked for the check which she quickly brought back with no further questions   Note that I also provided feedback to the restaurant via Square, and a couple substantial coupons were tossed my way to make up for my troubles. I appreciate it, but I doubt I'll be back to use them on food."}
{"text":"GF and I met another couple here for cocktails and appetizers.  I suggested the place purely because of the good reviews on Yelp and was kind of embarrassed that I did.    I wanted to eat outside but the outdoor space is terrible.  It is completely lacking in any adornment and there is not much to look at on this side street.  On a summer night when there were a lot of people eating outside on state street there was no one eating outside here.  Unfortunately the ambience inside is also completely non-descript.    My party all opted for \"dealers choice\" cocktails and no one was particularly thrilled by what the bartender came up with.  Mine was tiny, over-priced and simply ok.    The food was the best part.  2 of the 3 plates we ordered were very good--the falafel and the fried chicken.  I didn't particularly like the menu as a whole.    I was really disappointed by this place-- one of the few times Yelp has led me astray."}
{"text":"Holy cow the amount of delicious well made food and drink for the price is absurd. No idea how they manage it. The drinks were all well balanced and potent. The pita was literally the fluffiest I've ever had the pleasure of eating. We ordered extra just to have on its own. Great for just drinks or drinks and snacks OR drinks and dinner AND more drinks. Staff was friendly and attentive and patient AND attractive. We loved Amy's so we were apprehensive of Mezze but it is  Wish I still lived there so I could go once a week instead of just visiting once a year for Xmas."}
{"text":"We were struggling to pick a place for dinner, and decided to give Mezze a try.  I remember the Cap Times giving it a good review, so it seemed like a decent bet.  We ordered a beet salad to share, and it was pretty good.  Good flavors and textures and lots of goat cheese.  The pizza we ordered had goat cheese, nuts, rosemary and lots of onions.  It had a lemony flavor, too.  To me, the pizza was just okay.  I feel like both the top and bottom of the pizza was verging on burnt, with the middle a little too chewy.  I realize this is probably how the pizza is supposed to be cooked, but I'm not a fan.  The flavors of the pizza didn't really work for me either, lacking any sort of harmony.  It was too sweet, and the crust lacked flavor. I love pizza, and struggled to finish 2 pieces.  My companion enjoyed the pizza way more than me, but we both enjoyed that beet salad.  The place didn't really get too drastic of an upgrade.  It's still a dark, little space.  It's nice enough, but they really should have done something with that ugly floor.  Being there during the daytime really highlighted that dirty, beat-up floor.  The staff was nice.  The bartender that was working was making me super nervous, though.  I appreciate when restaurants and bars get creative with their drinks.  But, when using egg whites in mixed drinks, you need to make sure you are washing your hands!  Cracking an egg and then touching 10 other surfaces/objects makes me a little anxious. Wash those dirty, eggy hands! I had a sip of my companion's drink, and it was quite delicious.  Their happy hour seems to be a pretty good one for the frugal.  While I was never a huge fan of Amy's Cafe, I was willing to give Mezze a try.  It was okay, and I'd go back to try more dishes.  We spotted someone getting a chicken kabob, and it looked pretty great.  The dishes here are for sharing.  The pizza we ordered was definitely big enough to feed 2 hungry adults, though the beet salad was rather small.  The chicken kabob we spotted looked pretty big.  I feel like this would be a pretty decent spot for some late-night drinks and conversation.  While I'm not yet convinced it deserves be praised as a hidden gem, it does have potential.  I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"Besides having one of the best bartenders in Madison, this place has good freaking food! Very reasonable prices. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, very very well made. A very good execution of the \"hipster cocktail bar\" with unique cocktails and interesting dishes. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for. Atmosphere and service are A+."}
{"text":"Y'ALL CRAZY  MEZZE is DOPE you'd be a fool not to ask for a side of garlic yogurt with your pizza"}
{"text":"I think Mezze brings everything it's got to the table... not just literally. The interior design is simple yet stylish and romantic, and as others have said, it's such a date spot. The menu uses a select variety of funky ingredients with a mediterranean twist. We shared the beet salad with arugula, pistachios, red onions, chevre and sumac lemony spice... the beets tasted so fresh and rich that it seemed like they were just harvested, and the goat cheese, which I've found usually disguises other foods, complimented them astoundingly well. The crispy chicken with fried brussels sprouts and anchovy sumac butter was flavorful and totally satisfying for brussels sprouts lovers! The dish was sort of difficult to share, since we both had to cut our portions of meat off the bone, so I might recommend it as an individual plate. The cheese and charcuterie was pretty tasty- the best part was the pork confit-type spread. I wish they would have given us more pita bread and a few more slices of ham though. Overall, our experience was almost perfect... this spot is prime if you and a date want a quick, impressive small plate bite and drinks!"}
{"text":"Went out with our supper club group of 8 people on a Friday night. We loved that they took reservations as the place is on the smaller side. The drinks were delicious and they had a good wine and beer selection. Dinner was delicious! We loved all of our dishes that we tried. The ones that I can remember were the french Fries, mushroom hummus, roasted cauliflower, Broccoli salad, fried chicken, roasted acorn squash, falafel and I'm forgetting the name of the buttery hand pie stuffed with mushrooms. Definitely our favorites were the fries and the fried chicken.  The small plates are a great size, definitely on the bigger side as small plates can go and the price was amazing for how good the food was. Service was fantastic as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 but I'm not feeling generous today so I am rounding down. Formerly Amy's, Mezze is focused on small plates and pizzas.  Both their food and their cocktails are based around Mediterranean flavors and spices.  As my girlfriend and I are big fans of anything mediterranean, we were excited to stop by.  The dining room was dimly lit with votive cocktails on each table.  While they helped created a soothing ambience, it was almost too dark to effectively read the menus.  We opted for a few cocktails and 2 small plates and a pizza.  On the surface, the cocktails seemed priced too low ($6) but once we saw the glassware they were served in, then it all made sense.  They were tiny but well executed.  A real headscratcher however was the pricing of some of their bottles of beer.  After my cocktail, I opted for the Jolly Pumpkin Calabaza Blanca.  Assuming a price point of maybe $8, I was surprised when it was listed at $14.  Another bottle was priced at $21.  It just feels out of touch with the rest of the menu. As far as the food goes, we opted for the Broccoli Rabe, Lamb Kefta and a pizza with za'atar spice and labneh.  Flavor wise, we thought the food was spot on but I feel execution was a miss.  The broccoli rabe was served whole and slightly undercooked.  The lamb kefta didn't taste like it was grilled and lacked any smoky flavor.  The pizza crust was perfectly chewy and dense but the spices could have been more generously applied (and more salt). I like the fact the Mezze is catering to a different crowd and delivers a different experience that some other restaurants on State St (can anyone say Whisky Jacks?).  With the new apartments popping up all around State St, I think it will play well with young professionals and empty nesters who will want to give it a try.  But to keep them coming back, they need to tighten their kitchen game up a bit."}
{"text":"Why did I let a year lapse between visits? It's an unfortunate side effect of living in a city so flush with food options. My second visit has confirmed I can't let that happen again, though, list of other places to try be damned.   Mezze has a small menu but everything is executed perfectly. Each ingredient is high quality and perfectly prepared. A rundown of the items I've tried:  + Falafel: so tasty and filling + Taratour hummus: thick, creamy, perfectly seasoned + Curried cauliflower hummus: see above and then add the amazingness of cauliflower + Chevre with walnut, red onion, and rosemary man'oushé: a few too many onions for me but easy enough to remove to match my tastes +Za'atar fries with garlic yogurt: amazing spice blend and sauce so good that I was ready to dip literally everything into it  + Pita: the most pillowy and delicious pita I've ever had  Drinks are well-balanced and you can trust Dave, the owner/bartender to guide you in the right direction. Dave is supremely welcoming and somehow remembered both me and the occasion on which I had visited despite the long lapse in time. Music is always top-notch and makes me want to linger long past the end of my meal.  Make your way to Mezze next time you're downtown!"}
{"text":"We sat at one of the tables on the sidewalk, which was perfectly situated on a bustling street off State. It was lovely!  Our visit started out a bit sour because we had to wait 20 minutes before we could even place our order. When I went inside to try and order drinks at the bar, I found out the waitress was also serving as the bartender and she told me she would come out soon.   We ordered the chèvre pizza, broccoli rabe, and falafel. The entire menu is tapas and all reasonably priced. The food is really good too! The flavored have a unique blend that works really well together.   While the waitress was clearing our drinks, we were discussing ordering another round and tried to get her attention, but she hurried back into the kitchen. When we finally did catch her, we just asked for the check. Cue another 20+ minute wait.   I would definitely try this place again because the food was so good, but man, service was really bad. I'm taking 2 stars off on service alone.   It's worth noting that we went within their first week of opening. I hope they work out the kinks and hire some more help because this restaurant has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night for dinner and drinks.  We had the tabouli (very good, very fresh), the lamb hummus (tasty, solid, could have used just a touch more seasoning), and the fried chicken with brussel sprouts (very good).  3 delicious plates plus one free drink for $25?  Yes please.  My wife commented that the food was better than she's had at many of the busy trendy places around town when she meets her friends out."}
