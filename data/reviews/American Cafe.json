{"text":"i have to second the first reviewer's sentiments.  there is a reason this restaurant is consistently empty on a saturday night...while every other eatery at nyny is packed.  the food in most of our dishes was overly salty, and took forever to be served.  the hokey \"american\" theme is almost too overbearing to be taken seriously.  the staff is very nice and tries hard, but the food was utterly forgettable."}
{"text":"If you don't give the american cafe at least 3 stars, then your just a commie pinko spy!   In all seriousness though the american is a great classic dive bar. They have good prices. The gangster sized 3 dollar drafts are what keeps me coming back, that and its right off the parkway so I have to drive by it daily on my way home from work.  I'm more of a white collar type, but I like blue collar bars myself. This place does have a few trucker mouths but if you go more than a few times you will realize that everyone in there is really nice.  I have only been there a few times, but the last time I left I had the whole place tell me good night. And not because I was dancing on tables or anything.   The smoke in there though is a killer, and it could use a little sprucing up. Also the bathrooms straight from the goonies, but that's just how the building is designed.  I give it 5 stars because I'm a proud american!"}
{"text":"The American Cafe rules!  The food is great, try the pulled pork nachos or a one of the humongous burgers!  The jukebox is great and the servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was good but for what was offered and along with the wine selection, I felt it was a bit too pricey. We paid gourmet prices for a standard limited menu.   The service was what you'd expect but I felt that the wine list needed to be upgraded."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre at best. Don't waist one of your Vegas meals at this place.  Subpar at best."}
{"text":"I had a great experience for breakfast here. Yes, there was a wait,  but that seems standard for breakfast in Vegas. Told the waitress we were trying to get in & out in 40 min to catch our flight and it wasn't a problem, even though the place was packed. Service was very good actually. She was fast, but attentive.  I got a bagel with salmon & cream cheese.  Very nice presentation and fresh salmon.  I was very happy.  Hubby and the little guy had pancakes and waffles, which were both good too."}
{"text":"Sometimes getting a regular breakfast near where you are can be a pain. In New York, New York in the miniature city section, it was just what we were looking for. We sat at the bar, had one of the best Bloody Marys I've ever had and a good breakfast. Nothing is cheap in Vegas, would have been cheaper at home but who cares?"}
{"text":"Eat here if and only if you don't mind waiting 40 mins for a mediocre sandwich! Would be a 0 or negative if possible."}
{"text":"Well the American Cafe is an interesting place.   It's a bit out of the way but I had seen the sign from the highway and made my way down this particular night.    It's a small parking lot and it was relatively packed.  I took that as a good sign.  It's not a large place. Maybe 8 tables and mostly bar seating.  When I walked in, every table was empty but the bar was packed.  Okay. Not typical but no problem.    I have a habit of reading Yelp reviews for a place only after I'm there and seated.  I can say that as I read them the place made more sense to me.  Definitely a consistent group of regulars as everyone seemed to know eat each other.  I was happy to find they still had Octoberfest on Draft even though it was only two weeks before Christmas. Now that I rethink that, maybe it didn't sell well during the fall and it's just leftover?  Either way it was still good and not common this late in the year.    It was wing night but the waitress recommended the BBQ sandwich.  I also upgraded from chips to fries.    The sandwich was huge.  Well more than 1/2lbs of pulled  pork  BBQ.  From just a BBQ standpoint it would have been quite good on its own even without the BBQ sauce.  I actually think I would have liked it better without.    The fries were clearly from frozen (not that I should have expected otherwise) and were okay.  I may have been better off with the chips.   All in all I think it's pretty good place to grab a bite to eat.  I will second some of the other reviews, the music is LOUD. Don't expect to easily have a conversation with someone across the table.  You would need to yell to talk to the person next to you.  I also agree it's probably not the restaurant for most families.  Come to hang out, drink, listen to loud music, eat good (and filling) food."}
{"text":"This cafe is located in the NYNY casino.. we meet some friends from out of town there. Stay away is my recommendation!! The food came out cold and the service was very slow couldn't even get a refill on water. Took forever for the food to come out and I regular mayo they forgot about it had to ask twice. Need help !! Never again"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends at this nice little bar / restaurant before continuing on with our day together.  We all ordered lunch and the bacon, mushroom and Swiss burger that I had was not only delicious but so huge that I couldn't finish it. The steak sandwich that my girl ordered was stuffed with real steak, not that wafer stuff you sometimes get and it was topped off with sauteed peppers and onions.   The server, Rose, was quick and courteous.   I really didn't expect much from this place at first but as the saying goes,  \"you can't judge a book by its cover\". I'd come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Note: This is a bar AND restaurant. Their kitchen closes at 9 P.M. No desserts are on their menu.   So yeah, Kay and I have passed this shack of a place en route to her home and while in the area of Robinson on numerous occasions. The other night, we decided to stop.  American Cafe is a curiosity amidst the strip malls and chains, but it's there and seems to be doing well. We thought it was a quaint mom-n-pop, but in reality it's a rowdy bar that happens to serve food.   The food they do serve was pretty adeptly prepared based on what I ordered. For a starter, I got a cup of their chili adorned with shredded cheddar and raw bits of chopped onion. It's a soupy, mildly spicy chili with huge chunks of tomato and ground beef floating about, and while it doesn't beat my mother's chili (my standard), it went down easy on a frosted-over winter's evening,  For the entree I chose The Southern Belle, a bloated, vulgar, violent mess of a sandwich consisting of an Italian roll, pulled pork, sour pickles, and cole slaw with a big shank right through the middle.   I wasn't about to try and lift the thing, so I ate it with a knife and fork, treating it like that diner staple known as the hot roast beef sandwich.   No looks, yet loads of personality to make up for it, The Southern Belle essentially took me into the back room and had her way with me. The meat was sweet, falling apart in my mouth with the cole slaw acting as a creamy, cool, crisp foil.   Fried and seasoned by someone who knows what the hell they're doing and has been doing it for a while, the homemade potato chips (can't pass 'em up), were crunchy as a dog biscuit and were simply on the spot.   Kay got the Uncle Sam Burger with its BBQ sauce, onion ring, and (again) a steak knife jammed in it. Uncle Sam was getting the best of her, so I intervened, took a bite, and found the meat dry and flavorless, so we tossed it and decided to get the frack out of there.  Why were we in such a hurry? Well, I alluded to it in the beginning; it's a LOUD, ROWDY bar. I hate such places. If you read my other reviews, you'll see why.  American Cafe (what a misnomer of a moniker) is mostly frequented by foul-mouthed, obnoxious locals whose favorite words are anti-gay slurs. Beer-bellied, stupid, rude, bigoted and likely alcoholic/gambling addicted (poker machines are off to the side), the clientele are not the type decent people would want to dine with or even allow into their front yards.   I think half the people in American Cafe that night walked by our booth at least once just to gawk at us 'cause umm...they don' kno 'ho we urr 'n 'at.  I never understood why so many bar owners and regulars around Pittsburgh don't want new REVENUE at their establishments.   The server we had was nice enough and seemed somewhat apologetic for the atmosphere, that is when she wasn't engaging in tawdry conversations with the barflies. Our food took a spell to get to us (it took even longer just to get a menu after we sat down), and I then had to wade through the goonies just to find our server so we could get our check and escape!  Look, I don't like to disparage other salt-of-the-earth people since I'm one of them and become livid when people in higher-income brackets do the same. I just hate when people like those at American Cafe that evening make the rest of us look like trolls.  Anyway...   To be fair, my dinner (chili, sandwich, and side included) was pretty dern satisfying, hence my reluctant 3 star rating. If you have a too-huge-to-suppress hankering for pulled pork, and American Cafe does it up more than competently, I'd recommend stopping in for lunch as opposed to dinner, especially if you are a lady or have one with you. I apologized to my girlfriend all weekend for bringing her here.    And if you bring your kids here... well, you're probably one of the dum-dums who infest the joint. Ugh. Thanks a lot for raising more brutes for me to deal with.   P.S. Our tab was almost 30 smackers!   P.P.S. They brought us the largest cups I have ever seen for our beverages, which I appreciated since it meant not having to track down our server for refills."}
{"text":"Dive bar at it's finest!  All food comes with a side order of cigarette smoke, so beware.  Excellent Pulled Pork sandwich and a fun place with your typical dive bar characters!"}
