{"text":"I noticed this coffee shop a little while ago as I was getting off the D'Iberville metro and decided to give it a try this morning. I stopped in to grab a couple of americano's and was very impressed by how bright and clean the cafe was, with a small little play area for kids. The two guys working who served me we're extremely friendly and the espresso was perfect. The coffee's were spot on. Will definitely be going back again to try some of the awesome sounding sandwiches. They also had a great selection of baked goods, but I was just looking for coffee today."}
{"text":"Right across d'Iberville metro, a spacious coffeeshop is found. It's a regular looking place, with wood tables and chairs. There is a little play area for children. One counter to order your food and drinks. There is also a showcase with four different cake designs... so you can order your customized cake. 

The server was very sweet and friendly. I ordered a hot chocolate. I sat down, and I started on my Christmas cards. The server brought my hot chocolate to my table. She said it might be strong so if I wanted to sugar, it's on the tables. Believe me, I didn't need the sugar. It was simply super delicious! 

I was there about an hour; it felt very comfortable with great background songs. The vibe was calm and jazzy. 

Plus, the shop has a free WiFi."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and weekend brunch. Next time I will try some of the Brazilian foods/desserts. Very kid friendly. Love that there is a play area for babies/toddlers. Nothing negative to say about our experience. The service was attentive and courteous. Will definitely be back! Nice to have this cafe in the neighbourhood."}
