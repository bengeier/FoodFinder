{"text":"Good food! The Apple BBQ Pork Pita was very tasty."}
{"text":"This used to be a great little place.  Since it has changed owners and the original owner/chef left, it has gone down hill.  I used to go 2-3 times a week and always had a great experience.  Today was the 3rd time I have been there since the ownership change and last time I will go there.  They don't have any more daily specials, it took 50 minutes to get a burger and the general attitude of the staff is un-inviting.  They had a good run but I think that is over."}
{"text":"If there was a 3.5 star option, Juniper would get it.  Forgive me if I'm a tad bitter, the last time I tried to go I talked the place up and convinced a friend who had never gone to accompany me...  only to roll up and see a \"Closed today, apologies for the inconvenience\" sign on the door.  Game over.

Other than that, this place is pretty solid.  Both the clientele and the finish of the interior are much better than you would think given the neighborhood (see my review of the BP Gas station on E 9th).  A couple of times my server has been stretched a little thin but the food makes it worth the return trip.

The omelettes are right on the cusp of having too many ingredients in each of them yet Juniper somehow pulls it off.  My breakfast favorite is probably the eggs benedict..  the hollandaise sauce is pretty good.

So if you're in the neighborhood, throw on a kevlar jacket and drop by for lunch.  Oh, and I would recommend entering the parking lot going east on Carnegie to make a right into the lot b/c that left can be a b..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real gem.  The food is fantastic, the service was great and the atmosphere was very nice.  The restaurant clearly fairly new (either upgraded or built new).  We absolutely loved our breakfasts!  We had three different breakfasts:  a skillet (eggs with cornbeef), omelet and scrambled eggs.  The eggs were so well prepared (fluffly, not over cooked or too undercooked).  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was incredible. Everyone in our party was blown away with their dish, the apple BBQ braised pork shoulder was described as \"life changing.\" The sticks and stones (fried calimari and rock shrimp) were a wonderful start, they seemed very clean and wasn't greasy at all. Prices were comparable, if not better than most of the bars and grilles downtown with drastically better quality. Where else can you get fresh shark for under $10?

Looking forward to returning soon and often!"}
{"text":"Third time's a charm! My bf actually discovered this place and on his first visit, he brought me a late breakfast. It was ok, wasn't seasoned that well but the portions were great. Second time, he ordered the apple bbq pulled pork sandwich...absolutely delicious! And today, we both ordered the specials. He got the classic burger and I got the shrimp wrap. Again delicious! And the prices and service were good too. I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Nice place - modern looking with a full bar and not bad food, but not veggie friendly. Charge extra for everything. And Fox News was on both TVs... Service was just so so. Never did get a refill for my $2.25 cup of coffee. Upside is you are right by the Indians stadium. But I suggest you save your cash and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have only had breakfast there so I can only speak to that right now.  I love the house made foods.  The sausage has just the right amount of sage and was very flavorful.  The corned beef hash is made in house and had nice chunks of corned beef and yukon gold potatoes.  Need I say more?

The server was ready with coffee refills and the coffee was better than most for restaurant coffee.  

The servings are generous and the prices very reasonable.  I usually pay the same for items at other places that are not house made.  The restaurant is nicely appointed and look forward to returning soon.  They also offer free parking which is a great plus in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, delicious, fresh, friendly, clean and they serve alcohol. What more could you ask for?

I like how there aren't too many items on the menu. My server was great, so was the vibe in the place. 

Both of our breakfast's were really good. I did the corned beef skillet thing, and my friend did the hash. If your not big on onions, ask for lite.

I think I'm going to be a regular here. My only complaint is they close at 2pm on Sunday. We go hard Saturday night, I need a little more time to get up and going please."}
{"text":"This place. So impressed. We went for a late breakfast on a Saturday and ordered omelets. First, you choose whatever toppings you want, no limit. You get their amazing Yukon homefries and a side of toast or English muffin or a Bagel! I was imaging based on the looks of this place that the portions would be politically correct. Nope. Our omelets were huge and fluffy with a large helping of tates right there beside. The server was very friendly and the food was so tasty ANC very reasonably priced. Going back fir lunch soon."}
{"text":"Aesthetically this place is a breath of fresh air not only on the Cleveland breakfast scene but what also appears to be a newly reincarnated strip of restaurants on Carnegie (see: new Aladdin's Eatery across the street).  Industrial minimalist decor and FINALLY an eatery without standard issue round white plates (love those square plates).  Housemade granola is made without oil...actually refreshing.  Section of \"small plates\" for breakfast is great.  Prices are generally $2 above diner fare, making it a real bargain if you want to step up from Addy's or West Side Market cafe and if you don't want the pomp and circumstance of (gasp) a full-on hotel breakfast.  Yukon gold potatoes for breakfast were nicely seasoned.  What was I bummed out about?  Smucker's jellies and jams in those little plastic containers.  I expected house-made jams and preserves.  Carnegie Kitchen serving Smucker's jelly is like a girl wearing a Vera Wang dress with a pair of shoes from Payless.  Carnegie, please surprise and delight us with a trio of housemade jams or preserves to make your already standout food and dining experience that much better.  Pretty please?  And then I will upgrade you to a 5-star review!"}
{"text":"Came with my staff team for a celebration brunch. We ordered fairly standard brunch items like corned beef hash and omelets. The portions were huge! My friend who had the corned beef hash seemed pretty happy with his meal. Good for omnivores!

I got the vegetarian omelet. I don't eat meat and I'm staying away from dairy, so this omelet seemed perfect. Overall, it really lacked flavor and it tasted/smelled very \"eggy\". Lots of veggies though. Just not my favorite vegetarian omelet ever.

The decor is pretty modern and I like what they did with the space. It's a totally unassuming building on the outside with lots of different types of patrons on the inside. There were a few business meetings going on during the Monday morning brunch time.

The service was disappointing. Our waitress was great, but the hostess and person working at the bar were quite loud and unseemly for a restaurant. At one point, the hostess got really excited with her friends and started jumping up and down and doing jumping jack like movements? So unclear as to what was happening.

When we left, we were the only patrons left, and we didn't even get a goodbye. I know we're in the Midwest and maybe I've gotten used to Midwestern friendliness, but I have to say that not being acknowledged felt really disappointing."}
{"text":"I almost became a fan of this place today. I ordered a salad that came with fresh field greens, big croutons, olives, roasted red peppers, some kind of hard shaved cheese (can't remember), and some particularly delicious breaded artichokes. All of that was perfect...until I got to the bottom half of the salad where there was way too much balsamic vinaigrette. Bummer! And it was super tart for my taste buds, I think I actually winced... too much vinegar not enough \"ette\". A creamy balsamic would have been magic!"}
{"text":"It's no longer Juniper or Verve.  It's open for breakfast and lunch only.  Been there twice for lunch and very much enjoyed it both times.  Got an open face salmon sandwich one time and their own homemade corned beef the other.  Some of the best fries anywhere.  Prices very reasonable for the quality of the food.  It's become one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  Free parking right there."}
{"text":"Great service, food good and hot, portions large, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Carnegie Kitchen, how I love you so. You always make everyone happy in our party of 8 or more. 

Its pretty simple: Prices are great for a Downtown lunch and the choices are always unique twists on classic favorites. (The chef must be a real chef!) Fast service, yummy bites, and any mistakes on orders are actually taken extra care of by the staff. 

So good - I always opt for desert at Carnegie!"}
{"text":"Visited here again on a Sunday.  Apparently Sunday hours are new to them, and they were completely unprepared.

I only have an hour long lunch break and they took the most of it.  The server kept b*tch*n about the kitchen, but never delivered on the promise of refills, expedited service, and eventually a comp (she promised to comp a messed up meal, but never delivered).

After all of the server's complaining about the kitchen, they actually delivered a very tasty breakfast...no complaints there.  The food was awesome, but outside the kitchen it was a disaster.  Service imploded on itself.  It was so bad that the restroom completely lacked paper towel.  So I just walked over to their service stand and grabbed a bunch of napkins.

There's tremendous potential here, but if they don't get their act together quick they're going to go under.

Here's a nickel's worth of free advice for the owner/mgt  if they actually do the right thing and read these rants:
  *Hire a real kitchen staff (we saw people walk out due to the wait)
  *Must improve the service levels.  Start by professional dress and work your way up        to promises kept.
  *Keep the washrooms clean...if you can't keep those clean diners quickly become fearful that the same lack of cleanliness is going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch: good food and low prices. Especially enjoyed their fries."}
{"text":"Keep this under consideration...it IS Cleveland! The homemade corned beef hash wasn't the chunky kind I had expected after eating at the BEST corned beef deli/diner in Portland, OR, so that left me somewhat disappointed.  However, the flavors were good and reminded me why corned beef in Cleveland is likely in the top three in the country. The peppered bacon was peppery, the scrambled eggs cooked to perfection...they weren't overcooked and weren't runny at all! Coffee was mildly better than most diner coffee.  I really did like the eclectic group of suits, families, tattooed folks, and locals that were here when I came.  The waitstaff was great.

The only thing that lingers in a bad way is the oil...lots of it...in the corned beef, left on the bacon, even on the greasy spoon :) unfortunately Carnegie Kitchen doesn't present itself as a greasy spoon diner so that was super surprising and slippery! (3.5 if I could)"}
{"text":"Great find! Excellent service, good variety on the menu, great value..
We had the veggie omelette (add cheese and bacon), corned beef hash, and shared a banana pancake.
Everything was delicious, highly recommend getting a pancake! It was fresh, great portions, with the perfect amount of flavor without it swimming in grease. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Had a midweek lunch meeting at Carnegie Kitchen & Dining.  The space looked pretty nice, and the dining room was--I would not say \"crowded\"--but was pleasantly full by about 12:45pm.  The location is probably not the greatest for many folks working downtown--but the free parking in the adjacent lot is a big bonus.  The hot corned beef on rye was about average, but I did like the natural cut fries served along with them.  I wouldn't mind returning (and breakfast sounds good from the other reviews), but it wouldn't be one of my top choices."}
{"text":"BRUNCH - yes - BRUNCH! Finally a place that has brunch within walking distance of the East 4th Neighborhood.  Why are there not more options around there - confusing. 

As seen above, I love this place for brunch - but I just went there for lunch today and have a new found love for this establishment. 

The lunch menu is full of a variety of delicious looking options - of which, I opted for the Grilled Salmon open faced Sandwich.  Oh wow, the flavors on this were so well paired!  The fillet was covered in wilted spinach, feta cheese, and red pepper aioli.  WOW!  The best part was a substitution that I opted for ... ready for this ... SWEET POTATO Wedges.  They were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside.  It was the best treat on a cold winter's day.  They brought me a side of maple syrup, and those nuggets were like dessert!  Mmmmuah!  

Happy Ending Note:  Parking Lot with FREE Parking! How rare is that downtown?"}
{"text":"I went here when it was Juniper Grill, and my opinion then was it was good but I wouldn't go back... now that it has reopened as Carnegie Kitchen...  the sentiment hasn't changed.  It's good food, the presentation and quality is excellent, but for me the menu doesn't really fit my palate.  It's a little too much.  I read reviews in the Plain Dealer and other website that describe this as going back to the basics with breakfast and lunch.  Bottom line is the food is anything but simple and anything but the classics.  I ordered the open faced salmon something or other with all this extraneous stuff.  It was good, tasty and seemed pretty healthy. Substituted the fries for the baked sweet potatoes which were great.  Perhaps my real anger is with the reviewers who inaccurately described this place.  Worth a try, but not stopping back.  Where is my classic diner fare in downtown?"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot if you work in the playhouse square district.  The open-faced salmon sandwich is worth jay-walking and dodging cars for."}
{"text":"Decided on going to Carnegie Kitchen & Dining after I passed it on the way home from work. The following Saturday I went. 

From the restaurant's exterior it looks as though it will be a prototypical greasy spoon but when I entered the restaurant I was surprised to find that it was quite trendy. At the time, around 11:30am on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was in a lull with patronage and we were seated immediately. 

Being a massive fan of bunch I ordered a supreme omelette with hash browns. Thankfully the order was put in when it was because at that time around 40 individuals came into the restaurant at once. They were coming from a religious convention across the street at the Wolstien Center. Outside of the review, it was hard not to have a great deal of sympathy for the cooks and wait-staff. The look of panic was pretty apparent though totally understandable. 

This is where things got impressive: our food came out in about ten minutes in spite of the bombardment. In fact, all forty people from the religious convention got their food by the time we left the restaurant. Many had gotten their food as we were eating. 

The omelette was good but the potatoes were incredible. The surface was brown but the inside was perfect. I actually don't think I've had better potatoes. They were buttery, soft and warm. 

Though, there were some issues: the wait staff, prior to the bombardment, were a bit inattentive and seemed distracted. In addition, when the food runner gave us our plates, we asked for condiments, the individual acknowledge the request and then never came back. Thankfully, the food was great but small things like that enhance the experience.

I was still extremely happy with the experience and plan on visiting again. With the way some of their sandwiches looked, the place certainly deserves another visit."}
{"text":"Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli,
Bowzer from Sha-na-na, and Arthur Fonzerrelli!!

Ok, well that's what I was singing when I saw we were going to eat breakfast at the Carnegie Kitchen.  We were suggested by our hotel front desk to go here, rather than their overpriced hotel breakfast. It was quite a good suggestion!

They had one of the best omelets I've ever had in my life.  Fluffy and yummy!  The potatoes weren't really anything special but I ate that omelet up!  Good price too."}
{"text":"I would rate the food here a very solid four stars.  The fifth star is because of the service.  I love this place.  I only wish it was open on Sundays.  It's my favorite Saturday brunch place, or if I have to do schoolwork during the week.  The smoked salmon is by far my favorite thing on the menu.  Whether its in a sandwich or service with a salmon cake and cream cheese.  The fries are fresh cut and crispy.  The prices are perfect.  The fresh squeezed OJ actually tastes fresh squeezed.
The reason for the fifth star is once when I was with some friends here on a busy Saturday morning, our food took a little long to come out.  Probably only about 45 minutes.  We saw that they had a pretty large group to take care of first and we hadn't seen each other in a while so it wasn't really that big of a deal.  However, our server apologized to us and let us know the situation and then at the end of the meal simply stated that we were all taken care of.  They took care of our whole meal.  Even the coffee and orange juice.  That's never happened to me anywhere.  We hadn't even complained.  It was pretty awesome and one of the reasons that I will continuously come back whenever I can."}
{"text":"We slammed this place with about 25 of us on Saturday morning and they handled it famously.  

Coffee was good and hot and refilled without hesitation. I was all ready for a bloody mary, but unfortunately, they only have beer and wine!

We shared the homemade corned beef hash with 3 eggs, potatoes, and toast.  I wanna say it was $7.95.  The portion was huge!  They even served it on two seperate plates.  Now, I admit it....I am a fan of the good ole' fashined corned beef hash out of the can so I am generally apprehensive about the homemade renditions.  This one was good! The corned beef was lean, tasty and flavorful.  It was chopped up with big chucks of potatoes; furthermore, the breakfast was served with potatoes, so we did end up with a potato surplus.  We also had the potato and zucchini latkes with carmelized apples and gravy and sour cream.  These were a real winner!! It was a clever take on potatoe pancakes.  They substituted the usual applesauce with the carmelized apples and added a savory gravy for good measure.  The balance between the sweet and savory aspects made this a true brunch delight.  It was a large portion as well for only $4.95!

My sister had the penne with shrimp which she liked very much after adding seasoning...just needed salt.  She said the pasta was nice and al dente and the whole dish was light and flavorful.  

My mom did the chopped salad.   It wasn't what she expected (less chopped than she anticipated) but nonetheless delicious and she ate every bite!

The food here will ot dissapoint and the price and portion will keep you coming back! Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen.

I was  here at the beginning of the year during a visit to Cleveland and fell in love with the place. It had a menu that made you think, \"which one do I get this time, and what should I hold out for next time\".

With that kind of experience I was excited to return again when I returned to Cleveland.

Sadly, ownership changed and so did the food and unfortunately the service.

Albeit, I will say the issue with the service was organization, which stems from a lack of management. 

As for the food.

The \"to die for\" home fries turned into bland potatoes. 

The homemade sausage was no more, as were most of the specialty dishes.

Dare I say it, the Corned Beef Hash was sub-par.

You have many better options out there at more reasonable prices.

Steer clear."}
{"text":"Way to go Yelpers -- you found me an affordable, excellent breakfast on my first trip to Cleveland! Carnegie Kitchen & Dining seems a bit away from downtown in a random spot, but we were relieved to see easy parking in their lot after an evening of garages, valet, and parallel parking. The interior was spacious and comfortable, though the bathroom could use some more regular upkeep. They had a fair number of selections, ranging from omelets to pancakes. I wish I could tell you what I had, but I can't seem to find a menu online! The gravy was excellent, I can tell you that."}
{"text":"Very Average Food and Lower-Than-Average Service!

I came for lunch on Friday. Ordered Sirloin steak with two eggs. I ordered the steak as medium, but it came as well-done! I didn't want to order another one coz I had to wait over 20 mins for that wrongly made steak. Also, when the waitress brought the steak, she did not even give me a knife! She disappeared right away, and other waitress didn't seem to care to help me, so I had to get up to find a knife for myself to eat the steak! It's so hard to get hold of our waitress, and what's more upsetting is nobody else would help!

The food was really just OKAY! Not surprising or amazing at all! I am from out of town, so of course I won't come again! But even if I live in Cleveland area, I doubt I would come back!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Very modern inside, which I'm not crazy about, but a really nice experience! The waitress was wonderful, and the food (french toast!!!)  was really good and surprisingly cheap. We sat by the window and it was really clean and in a nice location. I will likely return!"}
{"text":"Great omelette (veggie with LOTS of veggies), excellent Service (Dana on his 4th day - woohoo) and cute setting with some upscale sophistication!!  Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. What a terrific find. 

Great food, excellent service and terrific value."}
{"text":"Carnegie Kitchen has the best pancakes I have ever had in my life. They are buttery, fluffy in the middle and crisp on the outside edge. So good.
I ate breakfast here twice while visiting Cleveland and both times were very good. It is a casual relaxed place with amazing food and great servers. I'm looking forward to going back and visiting again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast 3/21/11.  Onsite parking, nice room, good sized bar.  Attentive service.  Ordered corned beef hash and eggs.  Scrambled eggs were fluffy.  Hash used chopped slices of corned beef, not the ground minced, gloppy stuff.  Potatoes in the hash were good sized pieces, not little bitty pieces.  Marble rye (Jerry and George would be happy, a rye with substance!). To top it off, it was served piping hot-even best of places don't get it that hot.  A little pricey for breakfast, but not unreasonably (total was about $12.00 without tip).  Breakfast menu is not one that has everything on it, but all looks good and a bit out of the ordinary.  Open for breakfast and lunch only.  No website or facebook or twitter yet."}
{"text":"Downtown Cleveland usually doesn't have too many places open earlier than 8 for breakfast. Thanks to Yelp, I found a place where I might be able to watch some English Soccer games and enjoy and nice pint and breakfast to start off my day.

Now, being that this restaurant isn't near E. 4th, and is located on the outskirts of the city, I didn't have any high expectations. The building, you can tell, was probably built in the 50's or 60's. Large windows allow for a lot of natural pleasing light to enter. The decor is very nice. Dark woods accentuated with lighter tones filled the spacious room.

The bartender who took out order was very pleasing and nice. I knew to look out for an off-popular item on the menu to test what they were doing in the kitchen, so I decided with the \"Eggs in a Nest.\" Nice french brioche break with a large egg in the middle. The very gooey and delicious entre was accompanied by in-house made sausage. Nice balance of Rosemary and other herbs really pulled together this sausage patty. The potatoes were, I believe, flavoured with dill and possibly parsley. Very, very pleasing breakfast. Very cheap as well, which always adds to the enjoyment. 

I'm telling you, you can't get this type of food and this type of service for this price ANYWHERE downtown. 

I'd recommend this place in a heart beat to anyone looking to enjoy a nice breakfast in a nice, almost chic, restaurant. 

Also, cheers to the lad who had a good knowledge of the EPL, even though he was a Rangers fan ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I had the soup and burger specials.

The soup was a \"Sweet Potato Soup,\" but it didn't really taste like sweet potatoes. It was a very creamy, velvety broth with a cranberry relish. The pieces of cranberry gave a nice pop of sweetness. It sounds weird, but trust me, it was good. 

The burger special had an artichoke Parmesan spread, which was quite tasty, and came with thick cut fries. 

I'd definitely stop back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A friend sent me a link to check this place out. When I seen the profile pic of the \"house corned beef hash & eggs?\" I knew I had to try it! 

It was good to stumble onto a gem like this. Service was good, food was great and a college football game was on at the bar...great early evening breakfast!"}
